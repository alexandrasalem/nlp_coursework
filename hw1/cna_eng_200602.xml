    <HEADLINE>VP CALLS FOR OVERALL REVIEW OF CROSS-STRAIT TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb.1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Wednesday it's
high time for an overall review of the government's policies and
strategies for relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the sidelines of a Buddhist prayer service in the
central county of Nantou, Lu said that as China has never given up
its threat to use force against Taiwan since President Chen Shui-bian
assumed office in May 2000, the government needs to conduct a
comprehensive policy review and make necessary adjustments.</P>
      <P>Lu's remarks were seen a response to President Chen Shui-bian's
recent statements that he is seriously considering abolishing the
National Unification Council and the National Unification Guidelines
that require an eventual unification of Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Addressing a Lunar New Year's Day gathering with his grassroots
supporters in the southern county of Tainan this past Sunday, Chen
said some people have proposed scrapping the unification guidelines.</P>
      <P>"We should seriously consider and properly handle the matter, "
Chen said. "What Chinese unification are we after? " Chen asked,
describing the unification council as "existing only in name."</P>
      <P>The unification guidelines were adopted by former President Lee
Teng-hui as a commitment to eventual unification of the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait shortly after he took power in 1988 and the
National Unification Council was created accordingly to flesh out a
plan to promote the goal. But they have since been sidelined as both
Lee and Chen have moved to strengthen the island's self-governing
status and its separate identity from that of China's.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks have caused concern because abolishing the
guidelines could provoke China and escalate cross-strait tension.
China is ultra-sensitive toward any move that could signal progress
in formalizing Taiwan's de facto independence.</P>
      <P>Commenting on local opposition politicians's claim that Chen's
Lunar New Year's Day overture was in violation of his "five noes"
promise laid out in his first inaugural address, Lu said Chen's "five
noes" pledge was based on the premise that China has no intention of
taking Taiwan by force.</P>
      <P>Over the past six years, Lu said, China has never renounced its
threat to use force against Taiwan and instead stepped up its
deployment of ballistic missiles targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Against this backdrop, the premise for Chen's 'five noes' does
not exist, " Lu said, adding she feels that the time has come for
Taiwan to review its cross-strait policy and work out new strategies
to cope with China's intensified military buildup and diplomatic
offensive against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In his 2000 inaugural address, Chen said that as long as the
Chinese Communist regime has no intention to use military force
against Taiwan, he pledged that during his term in office, he will
not declare Taiwan independence, not change the national title, not
push forth the inclusion of the so-called "state-to-state"
description in the Constitution, and not promote a referendum to
change the status quo in regards to the question of independence or
unification. Furthermore, he said, the abolition of the National
Reunification Council or the National Reunification Guidelines will
not be an issue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP FACING CRUCIAL TEST AFTER LOSING MORE MEMBERS TO KMT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb.  1 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The political future of the opposition
People First Party (PFP) is facing an increasingly crucial test, with
more of its members holding public office planning to switch
allegiance to the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>So far, nine PFP legislators have left their party and joined the
KMT, including the four legislators -- Lee Yung-ping, Lin Teh-fu, Sun
Ta-chien and Chen Chih-ping -- who announced on Jan. 27 before the
Lunar New Year that they had joined the ranks of the KMT.</P>
      <P>Another PFP legislator, Kao Su-po. indicated the same day that he
would join the KMT before the Legislative Yuan opens its next
session. Two days earlier, PFP legislator Lin Yu-fang confirmed that
he had switched allegiance to the KMT.</P>
      <P>Earlier during the past year, four PFP legislators -- Lee
Ching-hua, Lee ching-an, Chiu Yi and Chou Hsi-wei, who was elected
Taipei County magistrate in December last year -- changed their party
affiliation to the KMT one after the other. Taipei City Councilor
Wang Hsin-yi also left the PFP and became a KMT member.</P>
      <P>A new regulation announced by the KMT in January is believed to
have produced a "magnetic effect" to PFP members by requiring all KMT
members seeking public office through party primaries and elections
to have had KMT membership for at least the last four months.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Ching-an has announced her intention to seek the
KMT nomination for the Taipei mayoral election at the end of this
year. Legislator Chiu Yi is keeping the possibility open of his being
a candidate in the Kaohsiung mayoral election. Other new comers in
the KMT said they left the PFP mainly to comply with the wishes of
their supporters who have been anxious for a merger between the KMT
and the PFP.</P>
      <P>An even stronger magnetic force is seen in the new leadership
provided by Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who became KMT chairman in
July last year. Apparently as a result of his personal charisma and
the new hope brought by his clean image, the KMT has attracted more
than 6,000 new members in the past few months, increasing the party's
membership to 1.06 million.</P>
      <P>Media reports in the past few days said that five more PFP
members holding public office might quit their party and join the KMT
after the Lunar New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>Some core members of the PFP still remaining in the party have
brushed aside the walkouts as "nothing unusual in politics," while
others have acknowledged that the series of departures by PFP
legislators may seriously affect future cooperation with the KMT.
Some radical PFP members have even suggested that the PFP should
support a draft law by the legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) that would ask the KMT to return
its "inappropriately obtained" party assets to the national coffers.</P>
      <P>Analysts have pointed out that the PFP is facing a crucial test
on whether the party would remain a political force to be reckoned
with after the 1997 legislative elections or disappear from Taiwan's
political scene like foams.</P>
      <P>With the number of seats in the legislature to be slashed by half
in the 1997 elections from the current 225 seats, the new electoral
system of "single constituency, two votes," with each voter casting
one vote for his favored candidate and another vote for his favored
political party, will place a small political party like the PFP at a
serious disadvantage.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the KMT has adopted a low profile about the new blood
that has joined the party. The KMT chairman has expressed welcome to
the new comers, but said he would not encourage more PFP members to
follow suit. KMT legislators appear reluctant to discuss how the PFP
walkouts would affect future cooperation between the two parties in
the legislature and during elections.</P>
      <P>The KMT and the PFP share the same political ideals, including
the eventual unification of Taiwan and China under a free,
democratic system.</P>
      <P>The two parties, known as the "pan-blue alliance," jointly hold a
slim majority in the legislature. After the latest wave of four PFP
members switching allegiance, the KMT now controls 85 legislative
seats, compared with 26 for the PFP, 88 for the DPP, 12 for the
Taiwan Solidarity Union, and eight for the Non-Partisan Solidarity
Union.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OVERSUPPLY OF HOUSING UNITS MAY CONTINUE UNTIL NEXT YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb.  1 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan recorded an oversupply of housing
units last year, with the average housing transaction rate declining
to between 50 percent and 55 percent, according to figures released
Wednesday by the Federation of Real Estate Development Associations
of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The federation's statistics show that a total of 128,730 new
housing units were placed in the market last year, representing an
increase of 25.5 percent over 2004, with the total value amounting to
NT$965.5 billion, showing an 30.7 percent growth over 2004.</P>
      <P>The oversupply last year was most serious in northern Taiwan,
with 43,465 housing units remaining unsold at the end of 2005,
representing a total value of NT$380 billion.</P>
      <P>Analysts at the federation said they believe that the oversupply
is likely to worsen either in the second half of this year or in
2007, unless Taiwan achieves a better economic growth rate this year
than 2005, or if the government takes a bold step to relax its trade
and economic policy toward China.</P>

    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles, Jan.  31 (CNA)
(By Chu Lu-sheng and Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wang Jin-pyng, speaker of Taiwan's
Legislative Yuan, told Chinese-language news media in Los Angeles
Tuesday that maintaining the status quo in Taiwan's relations with
China would better serve the interest of Taiwan's people than all
other options.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks while transiting the United States on his
way back to Taiwan after visiting Honduras to attend the inauguration
of its newly elected president, Manuel Zelaya, on behalf of President
Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>He said President Chen's recent remarks about his intentions of
scrapping the National Unification Council and the Guidelines on
National Unification could harm Taiwan's interests, as it would cause
cross-strait tensions to increase.</P>
      <P>Wang pointed out the U.S. government had already made it clear
that it would oppose such a move, regarding it as a unilateral action
on Taiwan's part to change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He said that at present, the existence of the National
Unification Council and the Guidelines on National Unification were
neither harmful nor beneficial. However, he added, if they were
abolished, it would provoke China and place Taiwan in imminent
danger.</P>
      <P>Commenting on remarks made Sunday by main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou that unification between Taiwan and China
should be the ultimate goal, Wang said Ma's view did not necessarily
represent that of the KMT.</P>
      <P>He said that Ma's predecessor, Lien Chan, had never said anything
like that while serving five years as KMT chairman.</P>
      <P>The Guidelines on National Unification were enacted in 1991 when
the KMT was in power. President Chen pledged in his 2000 inaugural
address that he would not overturn them, although they "existed only
in name."</P>
      <P>The KMT chairman said Sunday that if Chen did decide to change
his mind about the pledges he had made during his 2000 and 2004
inaugural speeches, the people of Taiwan would question his honesty
and sincerity.</P>
      <P>Chen's sudden change in tack is seen as an attempt to rescue his
low approval ratings by currying favor with the "deep green" factions
within the DPP who have been calling for moves toward Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party suffered a humiliating
defeat in local elections in early December last year, causing Chen's
approval ratings to drop to 10 percent. Opinion surveys in January
showed the rating had made a slight recovery, rising to 17 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER MUM ON CHEN'S LUNAR NEW YEAR'S DAY REMARKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang refrained Wednesday
from making any comments on President Chen Shui-bian's Lunar New
Year's Day remarks on relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Although most government agencies remained closed for the Lunar
New Year holiday, Su arrived at the Executive Yuan early in the
morning for work.</P>
      <P>Su was close-mouthed when reporters asked him at the Executive
Yuan entrance about his views on Chen's proposals to scrap the
National Unification Guidelines and the National Unification Council,
as well as to apply for United Nations membership under the name of
Taiwan rather than the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office Minister Cheng Wen-tsan, who
concurrently serves as Executive Yuan spokesman, also declined to
confirm whether Su had met with Mainland Affairs Council Chairman
Joseph Wu and other officials in charge of cross-strait affairs to
discuss the president's proposals.</P>
      <P>Instead, Cheng said that transportation services, law and order,
public safety, farm produce supplies and financial services have all
maintained normal operations during the current Lunar New Year
holiday, which ends Thursday.</P>
      <P>Su assumed premiership Jan. 25. Some observers claimed that Su's
predecessor Frank Hsieh had resigned over disagreement with Chen on
the policy toward China.</P>
      <P>Addressing a Lunar New Year's Day gathering with grassroots
supporters in Tainan County Sunday, Chen said he was considering
scrapping guidelines on unification with China and the institution
created to promote that goal.</P>
      <P>"There are people calling for the National Unification Council
and its guidelines to be abolished. I think now is an appropriate
time to seriously consider it, and examine it closely, " Chen told
supporters at the Lunar New Year lunch party in Matou, Tainan County.</P>
      <P>The National Unification Guidelines and the National Unification
Council were created in 1990 by former President Lee Teng-hui to
convince the Chinese government that he was committed to unification.
The creation of the council and guidelines paved the way for landmark
fence-mending talks between China and Taiwan in the early 1990s, but
the body has been sidelined since Chen took office in May 2000.</P>
      <P>"This is an extremely serious topic. As everybody knows, all
that's left of the council is its name, " Chen said. "This kind of
council and its representatives seek a unified China, and the
guidelines even accept the 'one China' principle. These are all
problems," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Acceptance of the "one China" principle -- that Taiwan is part of
China -- is a precondition Beijing had set for any official talks
with Taiwan. Chen rejects this principle. He insists that only the 23
million Taiwan people can decide Taiwan's future out of their free
will.</P>
      <P>Chen's statement has drawn a strong response from the main
opposition Kuomintang, which favors eventual unification with a
democratic China, with KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou saying there would
be a price to pay for breaking the promise.</P>
      <P>"President Chen has previously pledged in all sincerity and
seriousness in his 2000 inaugural address that he would not scrap the
National Unification Council and National Unification Guidelines
during his term of office, " Ma said, adding that the KMT would wait
to see Chen's next step in the matter before making an official
response.</P>
      <P>In response to Chen's remarks, the United States reiterated
Monday its opposition to any unilateral changes made by either Taiwan
or China to the cross-Taiwan Strait status quo.</P>

      <P>Two-way trade between Taiwan and Russia
amounted to US$2.7 billion in 2005, with Taiwan's exports to Russia
rising significantly, the Moscow office of the Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to TAITRA tallies, the 2005 Taiwan-Russian trade amount
was slightly lower than the 2004 volume of US$2.9 billion.</P>
      <P>The decline mainly resulted from a substantial drop in
international steel prices, TAITRA officials said. Taiwan imported
large quantities of steel from Russia in 2005.</P>
      <P>On the export front, Taiwan registered remarkable gains in
exports of notebook computers, screws and nuts and cosmetics to

    <HEADLINE>CHEN'S SPEECH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH STATUS QUO CHANGE: MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 1 (CNA)
(By sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's Lunar New Year's
Day speech has nothing to do with changing the Taiwan Strait status
quo, Minister of Foreign Affairs Huang Chih-fang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Huang was commenting the U.S. State Department's initial response
to Chen's speech that the United States is opposed to any unilateral
move by either Taiwan or China to change the Taiwan Strait status
quo.</P>
      <P>Chen said at a Lunar New Year gathering with his supporters in
the southern county of Tainan Sunday that now may be an appropriate
time to seriously consider scrapping the National Unification
Guideline and the National Unification Council to signify Taiwan's
unique national identity.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Chen also came up with two other proposals --
considering applying for United Nations membership under the name
of Taiwan if the official national title "Republic of China"
cannot be used and drafting a new constitution for Taiwan by the end of
this year to be put forth for a referendum in 2007.</P>
      <P>Huang said the president's speech came amid China's intensified
suppression against Taiwan since Beijing's enactment of its
so-called anti-secession law targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Politically, Huang said, China has forged extensive contacts
with Taiwan's opposition parties in attempt to deepen divisions in
Taiwan's already polarized society and debase Taiwan's
democratically elected administration.</P>
      <P>Diplomatically, Huang said, China has spared no effort to block
Taiwan's presence in the international arena. Among others, China
rudely killed Taiwan's recent application for taking part in
an executive commission meeting of the World Health Organization.</P>
      <P>Economically, Huang said, China has stepped up its "united
front" tactics to lure Taiwan investors. "Should this trend continue
unabated, we are afraid that local people will unwittingly
lean toward China, which could eventually lead to changes to
Taiwan's status quo," he argued.</P>
      <P>As the national leader, Huang said, President Chen is obliged to
remind local people of possible pitfalls ahead.</P>
      <P>"Chen's Lunar New Year speech mainly reflected his worries about
China's relentless suppression against Taiwan. Local people should
understand Chen's proposals from this perspective and refrain from
taking his words out of context," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Huang said, Chen's call for considering the
feasibility of abolishing the National Unification Council was a
response to the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan's
recent resolution that demands the Presidential Office dissolve all
ad hoc panels and commissions whose establishment doesn't have a
legal basis.</P>
      <P>Noting that the legislature's resolution included in its review
of the Presidential Office's 2006 budget bill, Huang said the
National Unification Council is one of the commissions that meet the
legislature's requirements for disbanding.</P>
      <P>As to the U.S. claim that if Taiwan applies for U.N.
membership under the name of Taiwan rather than its official title
of the Republic of China, it would constitute a change to the
Taiwan Strait status quo, Huang said it seems to him that the U.S.
has misunderstood Chen's remarks.</P>
      <P>"The use of formal national title is definitely the first
choice, but if the national title cannot be used, we should
consider using Taiwan," Huang said, adding that the government
will strengthen communciations with the U.S.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  2  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu called on
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou Thursday to
"correctly read" President Chen Shui-bian's inaugural speech of May
2000 before criticizing the president.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, Chen clearly stated that he will honor his "four
noes plus one" commitment if China abandons its plans to invade
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma's interpretation of that statement is that "as long as China
does not invade Taiwan, Chen has said he will not change his
commitment" to not declaring Taiwan independence, not changing the
national title, not pushing for inclusion in the ROC constitution a
description of Taiwan and China as two separate states, and not
holding a referendum on declaring independence or unifying with
China. Chen also promised that there will be no abrogation of the
National Unification Guidelines.</P>
      <P>Ma pointed out that since China has not invaded Taiwan, there is
no change to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. Since Chen only
talked about "seriously considering" abolishing the National
Unification Guidelines in his New Year Day speech last month and has
not yet taken any action toward that end, the KMT will closely
monitor his ensuing moves, he added.</P>
      <P>But Ma reminded Chen of the risks he may incur to the country if
he dares to make good on his threat to abolish the National
Unification Guidelines and the National Unification Council,
including the possible impact on cross-strait relations and on
Taiwan's relations with the United States.</P>
      <P>During a visit to a temple in Keelung, Lu urged Ma to face the
facts that since 2000, China has been increasing the number of
missiles targeting Taiwan and that more than half of China's People's
Liberation Army has been deployed for an all-out attack on Taiwan.
"Has Ma Ying-jeou taken notice of these problems?" Lu asked.</P>
      <P>"A real patriot" would try all he can to stop China using
military means to threaten Taiwan, she said, claiming that "some
people are trying to boost China's military morale in invading
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>She said Taiwan is independent and sovereign and it is time all
Taiwan officials based abroad, as well as the new foreign minister,
James Huang, worked harder to "re-interpret" Chen's 2000 inaugural
address.</P>
      <P>"We have been forbearing for too long, " she said. "Over the past
six years, China has greatly expanded its air and naval forces,
causing a great menace to Taiwan." She called on the world to pay
heed to China's military threats to Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. REACTION TO PRESIDENT'S SPEECH `BAFFLING': PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  1 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior adviser to Republic of China
President Chen Shui-bian claimed Wednesday that he "could not
understand" why some U.S. officials have reacted strongly to Chen's
Lunar New Year's Day speech in which he proposed to abolish the
National Unification Council (NUC) and the National Unification
Guidelines, both of which he expressly promised in his inaugural
speeches of 2000 and 2004 not to do.</P>
      <P>Wu Li-pei, who arrived in Washington, D.C. with a Taiwan
delegation to attend the annual National Prayer Breakfast scheduled
for Feb. 2, said he had taken the opportunity of his meetings with
American friends earlier that day to explain to them what he claimed
was "the true purpose" of Chen's speech and that his explanation was
acceptable to them.</P>
      <P>Chen said during a Lunar New Year gathering with his supporters
in the southern Taiwan county of Tainan Sunday that now may be an
appropriate time to seriously consider scrapping the National
Unification Guidelines and the NUC to signify Taiwan's unique
national identity.</P>
      <P>Also in his speech, Chen suggested that the country should
consider applying for United Nations membership under the name of
Taiwan if the official national title "Republic of China" cannot be
used and should draft a new constitution by the end of this year to
be put forth for a referendum in 2007.</P>
      <P>In response to Chen's speech, the U.S. State Department
reiterated that Washington is opposed to any unilateral move by
either Taiwan or China to change the cross-Taiwan Strait status quo.</P>
      <P>Acting U.S. State Department Spokesman Adam Ereli pointed out,
however, that Taiwan's participation in the U.N. under the name of
Taiwan would be a "unilateral change to the status quo."</P>
      <P>Ereli called the speech "surprising" because Washington was not
expecting it and was not consulted about it.</P>
      <P>Wu said, however, that there was no need for Taiwan to consult
the United States, since what Chen mentioned were steps that the
government would consider taking, rather than decisions made by the
government.</P>
      <P>He said it would be pointless to maintain the NUC, an
organization under the Presidential Office that has not operated over
the past six years.</P>
      <P>Wu claimed that scrapping the NUC would be consistent with the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan's demand that
non-institutional organizations under the Presidential Office be
abolished.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Wu continued, the point of the NUC and of the
National Unification Guidelines -- stipulating unification with China
as the ultimate goal of the country -- is extremely disrespectful to
the people of Taiwan, who he said have the right to decide the fate
of their country.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said it was "unreasonable" for Washington to link
Taiwan's U.N. participation under the name of Taiwan with a change to
the cross-strait status quo, pointing out that almost all countries
in the world call Taiwan "Taiwan" and that the United States has even
enacted the "Taiwan Relations Act" and has named its de facto embassy
in Taiwan "the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)."</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan will step up communication with the United States
to resolve Washington's apprehension that Taiwan might be trying to
change the cross-strait status quo.</P>
      <P>Earlier that day, Wu visited several members of the U.S. Congress
and gave a speech at a dinner reception hosted by ROC representative
to the United States David Tawei Lee. Guests at the reception
included AIT officials, former U.S. government officials and leaders
of the Taiwanese expatriate community in the United States.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ECHOES U.S. IDEAS ON CROSS-STRAIT STATUS QUO: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  2 (CNA)
(By Taijing Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed
Thursday that Taiwan and the United States share the same stance on
the cross-Taiwan Strait status quo, despite U.S. "concern" over
President Chen Shui-bian's statement Jan. 29 that he is seriously
considering scrapping the National Unification Council and the
National Unification Guidelines.</P>
      <P>James Huang, the newly appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs,
said Chen made the statement according to a recent resolution of the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan that demands that the
Presidential Office dissolve all ad hoc panels and commissions that
do not have a legal basis.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the National Unification Council is one of
the commissions that meet the legislature's requirements for
disbanding.</P>
      <P>"The president is just reflecting the concerns of Taiwan's
people. We hope that people do not misunderstand his statement. The
president indeed said that the government is considering scrapping
the National Unification Council and the Guidelines for National
Unification, and the proposal is being considered, " Huang said.</P>
      <P>"It is not Taiwan's intention to surprise the United States. If
there are differences on both sides, we shall strengthen
communication with the U.S. authorities," Huang added.</P>
      <P>Huang said the government has conducted discussions with the
American Institute in Taipei (AIT) and claimed that they have
resulted in helpful resolutions.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan had not notified the U.S. on its decision-making
procedure and before Chen made his statement, it is sure that the U.S.
would have been surprised. But this is not the case. There could be
differences between Taiwan's and the U.S.'s ideas on the issue, but
it is `not as serious' as people think," Huang claimed.</P>
      <P>Chen made expressly clear during his inaugural speeches in 2000
and again in 2004 that he would absolutely not consider abolishing
either the National Unification Council or the National Unification
Guidelines.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MULTI-PRONG APPROACH TO ADDRESS HUGE TRADE IMBALANCE WITH JAPAN: MOEA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  2  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
officials said Thursday that it will require a multi-faceted approach
to address the problem of the huge trade imbalance with Japan,
including stepping up the promotion of Taiwan products, improving
Taiwan's industrial structure and cutting imports from Japan.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) under the MOEA
said the government will also urge Japan to address the issue.</P>
      <P>The officials said they will continue to stage activities to
promote Taiwan industry in Japan and will invite Japanese
manufacturers to come to Taiwan to make purchases.</P>
      <P>They will also promote Taiwan's premier agricultural products
through footholds set up in Tokyo, Osaka and Fukuoka.</P>
      <P>In addition, they will help Taiwan manufacturers create their own
brand names or engage in technological cooperation with Japan to help
cut the trade imbalance.</P>
      <P>They noted that Taiwan recorded a trade deficit with Japan of
around US$10 billion in 1991, a number that has since doubled to
US$21.957 billion IN 2000.</P>
      <P>The trade deficit with Japan topped US$30.426 billion in 2004, up
46.83 percent from the previous year, and the number was US$31.46
billion in 2005, or a slight gain of 3.4 percent from the previous
year, the officials said, adding that although the increase has
narrowed, the huge trade imbalance is still a problem.</P>
      <P>The officials said that Japanese businessmen coming to Taiwan for
investment or technological cooperation used to import raw materials,
key parts and components and machinery equipment from Japan and then
re-export them after reprocessing.</P>
      <P>This, coupled with Taiwan's low investment in research and
development, which makes it over-dependent on Japanese technology,
has led to the increased trade imbalance.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has made great efforts to improve its industrial
structure and upgrade its technological standards, whenever there are
major construction projects in Taiwan or its exports increase, then
Taiwan will most likely import raw materials from Japan or machinery
equipment because of the geographical proximity, resulting in an even
greater increase of imports.</P>
      <P>They cited the example of the Taiwan High Speed Railway as an
example of this.</P>
      <P>Although Japan's economy has rebounded in recent years, its
national income and employment market have not improved
significantly, and the growth of personal consumption is limited,
they said, so that Taiwan's exports have not grown significantly.</P>
      <P>In addition, many Taiwan businessmen have shifted their
production to China so that in a lot of cases, Taiwan receives orders
but China exports them, which has not helped the situation, they
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'PAN-BLUE ALLIANCE' TO PUSH FOR DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT LINKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  2 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP) will cooperate to
promote the opening of direct transport, business and postal links
across the Taiwan Strait in the next legislative session, a PFP
lawmaker said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chang Hsien-yao, who is also head of the PFP's policy
research center, said that in the new legislative session set to
start later this month, the PFP will prioritize a bill jointly put
forth by the two parties to amend the Statue Governing the Relations
Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area to make
possible direct transport links with China.</P>
      <P>Chang said he hopes the "pan-green camp" of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) will
consult "rationally" with the "pan-blue alliance" on the bill and
threatened that otherwise, the PFP and KMT will initiate a vote to
steamroller the bill through the legislature when the four-month
consultation period expires in May.</P>
      <P>On the controversial cross-Taiwan Strait peace promotion bill,
which stipulates that a peace-promotion committee will be set up
under the Legislative Yuan, Chang said that as a goodwill gesture to
the DPP, the PFP will not oppose it if the DPP makes it a subordinate
body to the Presidential Office or the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Also, the PFP plans to include in the bill projects allowing
direct air links between Taipei's Sungshan domestic airport and
Shanghai's Pudong airport and direct shipping links between Kaohsiung
and coastal ports in China, Chang said.</P>
      <P>If the peace promotion bill and the bill to amend the
cross-strait statue are blocked by the "pan-green camp," the PFP will
not rule out the possibility of initiating a referendum on the
opening of direct links to be held alongside the year-end Taipei and
Kaohsiung mayoral elections, he said.</P>
      <P>In response, William C.T. Lai, a DPP legislative caucus whip,
said the cross-strait peace promotion bill is disliked by the DPP
because, he claimed, it is totally unhelpful to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Calling the bill a "surrender law" and a by-law of China's
Anti-Secession Law, Lai said the DPP will not accept a single clause
included in the bill.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Chiu Chuang-chin, who is a co-chair of the Home
and Nations Committee, said it is mere wishful thinking of the KMT
and PFP to amend the cross-strait statue and enact a peace promotion
law to promote direct links with China.</P>
      <P>Chiu said it would be more feasible to hold a referendum to
consult public opinion on opening direct links before the legislature
moves to amend the cross-strait statue and enact a peace promotion
law.</P>
      <P>Citing opinion polls conducted by the DPP, Chiu claimed the
public is split over the direct links issue, which he said shows that
there is apprehension about the opening of the links.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, David C. Huang, deputy convener of the TSU legislative
caucus, said the TSU is firmly against opening direct links before
concerns over Taiwan's national and economic security are properly
addressed.</P>
      <P>Huang said the TSU will make every possible effort to obstruct
any bills related to opening direct links and will not rule out the
possibility of mobilizing the people to counter attempts by the
"pan-blue alliance" to push the bills through the legislature.</P>

(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China is unilaterally changing the Taiwan
Strait status quo by increasing its military deployment and
intensifying its suppression of Taiwan, Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu claimed Thursday.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Washington's response to President Chen Shui-bian's
Lunar New Year's Day speech in which he appeared to do a U-turn on
his election promises of 2000 and 2004, Wu claimed that what Chen
said reflects the Taiwan people's deep concern about China.</P>
      <P>Chen said Jan. 29 that Taiwan should seriously consider
abolishing the National Unification Council and the National
Unification Guidelines, which were established more than a decade
years ago when the now-opposition Kuomintang was in power.</P>
      <P>The U.S. State Department responded that the Washington is
opposed to any unilateral move by either Taiwan or China to change
the Taiwan Strait status quo.</P>
      <P>It is not Taiwan that is trying to change the cross-strait status
quo, Wu claimed. "First of all, China increased its military
deployment drastically over the past year. Secondly, China kept
blocking Taiwan out of the international arena ever since it passed
its anti-secession law."</P>
      <P>"Third and finally, China insists on its 'one China' policy and
keeps asking countries to change their relationships with Taiwan, "
Wu said, claiming that it is China, not Taiwan, that is unilaterally
changing the status quo.</P>
      <P>On Chen's remark that Taiwan participate in the United Nations
(UN) under the name of "Taiwan, " Wu admitted that U.S. policy has
been very consistent in opposing Taiwan's participation in the U.N.
under that name.</P>
      <P>"But this is unfair to the people of Taiwan, who have the right
to participate in the international organization like all people from
democratic countries, " Wu said. "And U.S. President George Bush
claimed in his inaugural speech and the State of the Union address a
couple days ago that democracy is a 'proud product of the U.S.'"</P>
      <P>When you apply this "proud product" to the international field
and find that Taiwan is excluded from the U.N., "it is very ironic, "
Wu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO STAND BY OWN DEFINITION OF 'STATUS QUO': MAC HEAD</HEADLINE>

(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan, the U.S. and China's definitions of
"Taiwan Strait status quo" have never been the same and it has become
a wrestling ground for the three countries. Taiwan, as a sovereign
state, will firmly stand by its own definition, said Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is a democratic and sovereign country that has the rights
to participate in international organizations, such as the World
Health Organization and the United Nations. The fact of Taiwan being
a sovereign country is not negotiable. We have our own opinions and
will not compromise on some issues," Wu stressed.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said on Jan. 29, Lunar New Year's Day,
that Taiwan should seriously consider participating in the United
Nations under the name of "Taiwan" and abolishing the National
Unification Council and the National Unification Guidelines, which
were established when the Kuomintang was in power and set unification
with China as the ultimate goal for the country.</P>
      <P>The U.S. State Department responded by saying that U.S. is
opposed to any unilateral move by either Taiwan or China to change
the Taiwan Strait status quo.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan, U.S. and China's definitions of 'Taiwan Strait status
quo' have never been the same, " Wu said. For example, he added,
Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign country but the U.S. and China
obviously disagree. Taiwan and the U.S. have different definitions of
"status quo", a term over which Taiwan and China have disputed for
years, he said.</P>
      <P>"The U.S.'s definition of status quo has been blurry, " Wu said.
He quoted former U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific affairs James Kelly's report to the U.S. Congress in April
2004: "The U.S. does not support... unilateral moves that would
change the status quo as we define it."</P>
      <P>"But the U.S. never really defines it, " Wu noted. He said the
U.S. hopes to keep flexibility for all sides involved in cross-strait
relations with this "blurry" strategy, which sometimes does serve
Taiwan's interests well.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. HOPES THERE WILL BE NO MORE SURPRISES FROM TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  2 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin, Jorge Liu and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-ranking U.S. State Department
official said Thursday that Washington expects Taipei to continue to
honor its commitment to maintain the cross-Taiwan Strait status quo
and hopes there will be "no surprises" between Washington and Taipei.</P>
      <P>James Keith, senior advisor for the Bureau of East Asia and
Pacific Affairs, made the remarks in the wake of ROC President Chen
Shui-bian's proposal over the weekend that the country should
seriously consider scrapping the National Unification Council and the
National Unification Guidelines, both of which Chen expressly
promised in his inaugural speeches of 2000 and 2004 not to do.</P>
      <P>Chen also suggested that the country should consider applying for
United Nations membership under the name of Taiwan if the official
national title "Republic of China" cannot be used and should draft a
new constitution by the end of this year to be put forth for a
referendum in 2007.</P>
      <P>Keith reiterated that the United States' "one-China policy"
remains unchanged and that Washington does not support Taiwan
independence and is opposed to any unilateral change in the
cross-strait status quo.</P>
      <P>"We believe that the president and his government will continue
to adhere to the status quo, which is our policy. And we have every
expectation that the kind of assurances that we were provided in the
past will continue to be honored, " Keith told reporters after a
hearing of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.</P>
      <P>Keith said Washington and Taipei maintain good communication on
this subject and that such communication will continue in the future.</P>
      <P>"We'll continue to communicate very directly and very closely
with Taiwan representatives on our desire to be sure that there will
be no surprises between us," Keith added.</P>
      <P>In what was the first response by Washington to President Chen's
speech, Acting State Department Spokesman Adam Ereli on Monday called
it "a surprise" and claimed that Taiwan's participation in the U.N.
under the name of Taiwan would represent a "unilateral change to the
status quo."</P>
      <P>Keith, however, declined to elaborate on the point about Taiwan's
U.N. participation, saying "I don't believe I said that." He also
declined to comment on whether Chen's speech represented a
violation of his "five noes" commitment.</P>
      <P>"From our perspective, we know that our policy hasn't changed. We
have every expectation that that will be the same in Taiwan as well,"
he said.</P>
      <P>In his inaugural speeches of 2000 and 2004, Chen pledged not to
declare independence for Taiwan, not to change the official name of
the country, not to include the "state-to-state" concept on
cross-strait relations in the Constitution, not to promote a
referendum to change the cross-strait status quo, and not to abolish
the National Unification Guidelines and the National Unification
Council.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian resolved Friday to
fulfill his duty to lead the people of Taiwan to "do the right things
and walk the right paths" in the year to come.</P>
      <P>Addressing a post-Lunar New Year gathering with Presidential
Office officials, Chen said he was greatly inspired by the book "The
Faith of George W. Bush" which he read during the holiday period.</P>
      <P>Chen said that from the book, he got the idea that "where there
is faith, there is no fear" and "where there is no fear, there is
strength" which eventually leads to success.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said he has three wishes for the Year of the Dog,
namely that solidarity and harmony will prevail in Taiwan, that there
will be no disasters in the country, and that care and compassion
will be everywhere in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president said that in addition to getting together with
family, giving thanks is another important part of the Lunar New

    <HEADLINE>SCRAPPING OF NUC CAN BE STUDIED: DPP LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's proposal to scrap
the National Unification Guidelines and the National Unification
Council (NUC) are issues that can be studied, the legislative caucus
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Friday, adding
that it will give its full support to the issue.
Chen Chin-jin, DPP caucus whip in the legislature, noted that the
president said in his speech that he will reinforce Taiwan's
sovereignty and that the people of Taiwan should be the ones to
decide the future of the nation.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's future should not be decided by the pro-unification
opposition parties, according to the legislator, who added, however,
that main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, who has
criticized the president's proposal as rash, should not "panic, "
because the president's words were only meant to highlight Taiwan's
unique sovereign status.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yi-jin, another whip of the DPP legislative caucus, claimed
that President Chen's statement was more proclamatory than
substantive.</P>
      <P>This, she said, is because Taiwan is already a sovereign
independent country and has maintained its status quo, and that the
NUC and the National Unification Guidelines, which were stipulated
more than a decade ago by the then-KMT government, exist in name
only.</P>
      <P>President Chen said at a Lunar New Year gathering with his
supporters in the southern county of Tainan Sunday that he might
seriously consider scrapping the NUC and the National Unification
Guidelines to "highlight Taiwan's unique national identity, " despite
promises he made in his presidential inaugural speeches of both 2000
and 2004 that he would not do so.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Chen also came up with two other proposals --
considering applying for United Nations membership under the name of
Taiwan and drafting a new constitution by the end of this year to be
put to a referendum in 2007 as long as China has no intention to use
force against Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will funnel NT$15 billion
(US$468.75 million) by 2010 to develop the infrastructure of the
biotechnology industry, Council for Economic Planning and Development
officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that biotechnology is one of the major technologies
that the country is developing, the officials said the government
will continue to relax its rules and controls, provide information,
encourage technological exchanges, offer human resources support and
help local biotech firms establish strategic alliances with foreign
companies, in addition to channelling funds into the industry.</P>
      <P>They noted that in 1995, the government finalized a project to
promote the development of the biotechnology industry and formed a
group responsible for providing guidance to the industry.</P>
      <P>In the past few years, the Council of Agriculture and the
National Science Council have promoted projects for the establishment
of an agri-biotechnology industrial park, a biomedical industrial
park in Hsinchu, an orchid biotechnology park in Tainan County and a
maritime biotechnology industrial park in Ilan County, they said.</P>
      <P>In 2005, the government launched a project aimed at developing
Taiwan into a "biomedical island " with plans covered by the project
including the National Health Information Infrastructure program, the
Taiwan BioBank program and a program on the construction of a
clinical experiment system, they said.</P>
      <P>They predicated that Taiwan's biotechnology industry has strong
development potential in the future in light of the industry's sound
fundamentals.</P>
      <P>According to data from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan's
biotechnology industry posted total sales of NT$144.9 billion in
2004, up 10 percent from the year-earlier level.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW CHINA INVESTMENT POLICY HELPFUL TO TAIWAN ECONOMY: RESEARCHER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  3  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's "active management,
effective opening" policy laid out by President Chen Shui-bian in his
New Year's Day speech will help lift Taiwan's economy, an economist
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chi-yuan, a researcher at Academia Sinica, Taiwan's highest
research institute, said that the outlook of Taiwan's economy remains
encouraging after the government decided to shift to Chen's policy to
better guide China-bound investment. He made the analysis in the
newest edition of the electronic newspaper operated by the Investment
Commission under the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>Tsai based his optimism on the fact that Taiwan's tax revenues
totaled NT$1.564 trillion (US$48.9 billion) for 2005, up by NT$177
billion over the 2004 level and up by NT$184.6 billion over the
government's target.</P>
      <P>He attributed the growth to increases in Taiwan's per-capita
income and the amount of tax payable by returning Taiwan businessmen
from China, noting that income tax revenue grew the most -- by
NT$169.8 billion last year.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, some 20 percent of the Taiwan businessmen who
relocated to China have already returned home to operate due to the
major investment risks and rising labor costs there. He said he
expects more and more such businessmen to make larger investments at
home as a result of the government's new measures, thus propping up
Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan businessmen will naturally invest at home, where
investment risks are much lower than in China, as long as estimated
profits to be made on either side are about at the same level, he
claimed.</P>
      <P>This is the main reason behind the government's success in
collecting an extra NT$184.6 billion in tax revenues, evidenced in
the fact that private-sector fixed capital investment at home has
picked up in the last two years, he said.</P>
      <P>A low investment willingness among Taiwan companies in the home
market between 2001 and 2003 was due to the government's "active
opening, effective management" China investment policy of that time,
which he said prompted a large number of businesses to "go west" in
search of greater profits.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DISPUTE OVER PROPOSED SCRAPPING OF NUC EXPECTED TO END SOON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  3 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The dispute resulting from President Chen
Shui-bian's proposal to scrap the National Unification Council and
the National Unification Guidelines is expected to cease before the
legislature opens its new session this month, Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Friday.</P>
      <P>Wang described the National Unification Council and the National
Unification Guidelines as "two pillars" that help stabilize the
relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"I believe the president is fully aware that to have the two
pillars dismantled will only cause trouble," he said.</P>
      <P>Wang pointed out that it is evident the legislature wants the
National Unification Council to continue to exist, as the legislature
has not slashed all the 2006 budget for the council.</P>
      <P>He said that even if a motion calling for the scrapping of the
council and the National Unification Guidelines is introduced in the
legislature, the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang
(KMT) and the People First Party, which jointly hold a slim majority,
is unlikely to allow it to pass.</P>
      <P>Wang expressed the belief that by now the president should have
become aware of the reactions to his proposal from both home and
abroad, including the U.S. government.</P>
      <P>With all sides having made their positions clear and provided the
president does not take any further steps, the dispute should come to
an end before the next legislative session opens, Wang said.</P>
      <P>At a Jan. 29 Lunar New Year gathering with his supporters in
Tainan, southern Taiwan, Chen said it might be an appropriate time to
seriously consider scrapping the National Unification Guidelines and
the National Unification Council to "signify Taiwan's unique national
identity, " despite having promised in his inaugural speeches of both
2000 and 2004 not to do so provided China does not attack Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks drew an immediate backlash from the U.S. State
Department, which reiterated earlier this week that United States is
opposed to any unilateral move by either Taiwan or China to change
the cross-Taiwan Strait status quo.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou urged the Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council to take immediate action to prevent the
dispute from developing into even more of a crisis.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP CHAIRMAN  FIRMLY OPPOSED TO DE JURE TAIWAN INDEPENDENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 3 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP) Chairman
James Soong said Friday that his party opposes any pro-independence
unilateral changes to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait that
could bring Taiwan to the brink of war with China.</P>
      <P>Soong urged the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government not
to place personal political interests ahead of national benefit and
hurt the welfare of Taiwan's people.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks at PFP headquarters during a gathering with
party staff to celebrate the Chinese New Year.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the PFP will do its utmost to protect the status
quo between Taiwan and China, Soong made it clear that this means
that the "de jure existence" of the Republic of China in line with
the Constitution must be maintained and that the PFP will never
promote "de jure Taiwan independence."</P>
      <P>Maintaining the cross-strait status quo is a means to build
mutual respect, make peace and develop co-existence, amend
differences and settle disputes, he said.
</P>
      <P>According to the PFP chairman, remarks made by President Chen
Shui-bian since the beginning of this year until Jan. 29 -- the Lunar
New Year's Day -- all indicate that Chen will devote his energy to
advocating "hasty independence" during his last two years in office.</P>
      <P>Soong accused the president of seeking to solidify his power base
within the DPP by fueling cross-strait tension so as to shift public
attention away from the DPP's alleged corruption and poor performance
to the independence-unification dispute.</P>
      <P>Chen also said Jan. 31 that he might seriously consider scrapping
the National Unification Council and its guidelines, which serve as
the framework of Taiwan's eventual unification with China, despite
promises he made in his inaugural speeches of both 2000 and 2004 not
to do so as long as China has no intention to use force against
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks drew an immediate backlash from Washington, which
reiterated its stance that the United States does not support Taiwan
independence and that it opposes any unilateral move by either Taiwan
or China to change the cross-strait status quo.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has no intention of "surprising" the
United States and if Washington continues to feel surprised, Taiwan
will continue to communicate with it, Minister of Foreign Affairs
Huang Chih-fang said Friday.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks in response to comments by a high-ranking
U.S. State Department official, on the sidelines of the presentation
of a medal to his predecesor, Tan Sun Chen, who now serves as
secretary-general of the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>James Keith, senior advisor for the Bureau of East Asia and
Pacific Affairs, said Thursday that Washington expects Taipei to
continue to honor its commitment to maintaining the cross-Taiwan
Strait status quo and hopes there will be "no surprises" between
Washington and Taipei.</P>
      <P>Keith was speaking in the wake of President Chen Shui-bian's
proposal over the weekend that the country should seriously consider
scrapping the National Unification Council (NUC) and the National
Unification Guidelines, both of which Chen expressly promised in his
inaugural speeches of 2000 and 2004 not to do as long as China has no
intention to use force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The response of the United States is the result of a gap of
perception between Washington and Taipei," Huang claimed.</P>
      <P>The president said the nation should "seriously consider" the
scrapping of the NUC and the National Unification Guidelines, not
that the nation "has made a decision," Huang continued.</P>
      <P>"If the nation only notifies the United States after it has made
the decision, then it would be a surprise," Huang said, adding that
"we have no intention of giving the United States a surprise."</P>
      <P>"But if the U.S. feels surprise, then the government will pay
attention and the Foreign Ministry will continue and strengthen
communication with the U.S.," he said.</P>
      <P>On news reports that the U.S. does not accept Taiwan's
explanation of Chen's apparent U-turn, Huang said the communication
is still ongoing and that the media should not judge too early that
the U.S. is dissatisfied.</P>
      <P>Huang also said the fundamentals of Taiwan-U.S. relations are
good, that the stance of both countries on safeguarding the status
quo of the Taiwan Strait is unchanged and that there are also shared
interests between them.</P>
      <P>But he said that two countries cannot possibly see eye to eye on

      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Ma

"pan blue alliance" to check and balance the government.</P>
      <P>Ma issued the call after attending a Chinese New Year gathering

      <P>Claiming that the KMT is a middle-of-the-road party, Ma said the
two main "pan blue alliance" parties -- the People First Party and
the KMT -- have the same roots and share similar ideals that lay a
solid foundation for full PFP-KMT cooperation. He insisted that the
"pan blue alliance" must unify and closely collaborate with the
Non-Partisan Solidarity Union to keep the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) government in line.</P>
      <P>He made the comment in response to remarks made earlier the same
day by PFP Chairman James Soong, who said that the PFP will stick to
a "middle road" approach and "walk its own path" in terms of its
future dealings with the KMT.</P>
      <P>Soong said that the PFP will no longer involve itself in
wrangling between the two camps, will care more about
middle-of-the-road people and will pass judgment from the public's
viewpoints to heed the people's needs.</P>
      <P>The PFP is determined to continue to scrutinize a bill related to
a major arms procurement package from the United States and a
nomination list submitted by President Chen Shui-bian for Control
Yuan members in the next legislative session, Soong said.</P>
      <P>Soong estimated that April will be an appropriate time to further
discuss the major arms procurement bill -- after Chinese President Hu
Jintao has paid a visit to the United States.</P>
      <P>In addition, Soong said, Premier Su Tseng-chang should also give
a report to the Legislative Yuan to clarify the government's stance
toward issues regarding weapons purchases and cross-Taiwan Strait
relations.</P>
      <P>The PFP favors maintaining an adequate national defense
capability but is firmly opposed to turning Taiwan into a military
base or a partner of any military alliance, he said, adding that
maintaining neutrality is the best way for Taiwan to keep its
advantages.</P>
      <P>The PFP will get to the bottom of these issues and is open to
discussions and exchanges of opinion with the KMT and the DPP on
related matters, Soong said.</P>
      <P>The PFP chairman also accused Chen of shrinking Taiwan's space in
the international community by claiming recently that he might
consider scrapping the National Unification Council and the National
Unification Guidelines and seeking to get Taiwan admitted to the
United Nations under the name of Taiwan, as China has yet to drop its
military threats against Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ARMS PROCUREMENT PACKAGE SHOULD BE DEALT WITH AFTER APRIL: PFP HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP) Chairman
James Soong said Friday that the Legislative Yuan should not deal
with the arms procurement package until after April.</P>
      <P>Soong made his stance known on the sidelines of a Lunar New Year
gathering of the PFP.</P>
      <P>He said the party should wait until new Premier Su Tseng-chang
makes the administrative report to the Legislative Yuan and clearly
states his administration's stance on cross-Taiwan Strait relations
and the arms procurement package before dealing with the issue.</P>
      <P>The opposition "plan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and
the PFP enjoys a slim majority in the legislature and has blocked the
budget bill for a government plan to buy three big-ticket weapons
from the United States, including eight diesel-electric submarines,
six Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries and 12 submarine-hunting
P-3C aircraft for more than a year.</P>
      <P>Noting that Chinese President Hu Jintao will visit the United
States in April, Soong predicted that Hu's visit could affect
cross-strait relations, as well as arms procurement package.</P>
      <P>"For these reasons, the legislature should not consider the
arms project until after April," Soong said.</P>
      <P>He also claimed that the PFP will not oppose for opposition's
sake and will not rule out discussing the matter with the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party and the KMT.</P>
      <P>On a KMT plan to submit its own version of the arms procurement
project, Soong said "there is room for discussion" but he added that
the project should not be initiated by the opposition, saying that
the duty of the opposition is to find fault with the existing
proposed arms procurement package.</P>
      <P>He said the policy of arms procurements should be made through a
democratic mechanism, which means that the legislature should decide,
adding that the Ministry of National Defense can give its
professional views but it is the legislature that should make the
final judgment.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should maintain independent national security but should
not forge with other countries or be turned into a base for such a
military alliance, Soong said, adding that a non-alliance status is
in Taiwan's best interests.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the confirmation of Control Yuan
nominees long stalled in the Legislative Yuan, around NT$100 million
(US$3.13 million) in related budget for 2005 that had not been used
has been returned to the national coffers, a Control Yuan official
reported Friday.</P>
      <P>Tu Shan-liang, secretary-general of the Control Yuan, also said
that the budget for the Control Yuan for this year has been frozen
until such time as the Control Yuan members assume their posts.</P>
      <P>Tu's remarks came a year after the last Control Yuan -- the
nation's highest watchdog body -- expired in January 2005, with the
successors nominated by President Chen Shui-bian blocked by the
opposition-controlled legislature, which is not satisfied with the
nominees, especially the nominated president, Clement C.P. Chang.</P>
      <P>Tu noted that between February and December 2005, the Control
Yuan received 16,053 petitions from the public and
reports from the related government agencies and 3,756 cases
concerning the asset reports of public functionaries and the filing
of political donations.</P>
      <P>Tu said the Constitution and the Control Law stipulate that among
the two major categories of cases received, 11,617 cases will require
the Control Yuan members to exercise their authority, but he noted
that the cases remain unattended to because no Control Yuan members
are in service.</P>
      <P>He also said the Control Yuan used to receive more than 1,400
petitions every month, a number that has dwindled to around 500 or
600 cases a month because the public knows that no nominees are in
service.</P>
      <P>Although there are presently no Control Yuan members to
investigate the operations of the Executive Yuan and its subordinate
organizations, Control Yuan staff have privately collected 
information or went on-site for examinations, he added.</P>

      <P>A Taiwan research institute has successfully

      <P>The Material and Chemical Research Laboratories (MCL) under the

more costly and not as safe.</P>
      <P>According to the MCL, the two main obstacles in the application
of lithium iron phosphate material lay in patent rights and power

      <P>Former Premier Sun Yun-suan remained in
critical condition Friday after being admitted to hospital Jan. 30 to
receive treatment for acute myocardial infarction with heart and lung
complications, according to doctors at the Veterans General Hospital
in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Sun, 93, was premier of the Republic of China from 1978 to 1984.
Before becoming premier, he served as minister of economic affairs
for nine years. He suffered a stroke 20 years ago and has relied on a
wheelchair for mobility.</P>
      <P>Sun was first rushed to National Taiwan University Hospital on
Jan. 30 after having difficulty breathing. He was later transferred
to the Veterans General Hospital and has been under intensive care.</P>
      <P>The doctors said at one time they could no longer detect his
heartbeat, but managed to resuscitate him. He had such complications
as acute heart failure and pulmonary edema. He became fully conscious
and his temperature and blood pressure returned to normal, although
he was still listed in critical condition.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian paid a visit to Sun at the hospital
Friday morning and stayed for about 15 minutes.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A police task force busted an international
heroin-trafficking ring Friday, seizing 50 kilograms of high-grade
heroin with an estimated street value of NT$800 million (US$25.05
million) from a container with imported furniture at Taichung Harbor.</P>
      <P>The task force, consisting of officers from the Criminal
Investigation Bureau, Taichung Harbor police, Taichung city police
and officials from the Taichung Customs Office, was formed after the
Criminal Investigation Bureau received tips that drug traffickers
might use imported furniture to smuggle heroin through Taichung
Harbor during the Lunar New Year holidays.</P>
      <P>Led by a prosecutor from the Public Prosecutors Office in
Panchiao, Taipei County, the task force spent a full day searching
all containers with imported furniture at Taichung Harbor. Initially,
the task force found 55 "Double Lion" brand heroin cakes, together
weighing 20 kg, hidden in a sofa. As the operation continued into
Friday night, the task force found 80 more heroin cakes, weighing
30 kg in total.</P>
      <P>The police arrested the importer of the furniture, Chen
Teng-yueh, and discovered he had formerly succeeded in smuggling
heroin from Thailand and China's Yunnan province several times by
hiding heroin cakes in furniture and having them shipped to Taiwan in
containers.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the police task force said that drug traffickers
were anxious to get new supplies because recent seizures by police
had caused the price of heroin and other drugs to rise in Taiwan, and
that the alleged trafficker chose the Lunar New Year holidays to
smuggle heroin because he expected considerably fewer police to be on
duty.</P>
      <P>According to the National Police Administration, during the
January-November period last year, police seized a total of 196 kg of
drugs, including heroin, morphine and cocaine, with heroin accounting
for most of the seizures.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA REVIEWING MECHANISM FOR ADJUSTMENT OF UTILITY RATES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) is
reviewing existing formulas for making adjustments in utility rates,
officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>With international crude oil prices remaining at a high level,
many are concerned whether the government will adjust the rates of
public utilities in order to reflect rising energy costs.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-lung said the
ministry must make a comprehensive review before any decision can be
made with regard to price adjustment.</P>
      <P>"Adjusting utilities rates tends to have a profound impact on the
nation's overall economic development, its future competitiveness and
consumer price stability. We must make a careful review before coming
up with any proposal regarding price adjustments, " Chen said, adding
that the ministry is still evaluating various factors, including
adjustment formulas for utilities rates.</P>
      <P>The water and electricity pricing formulas have been in place
many years, Chen said, adding that the ministry has also worked out a
mechanism for adjusting gasoline prices that is in tune with
fluctuations in international crude oil prices.</P>
      <P>With rapid changes in the international and domestic markets,
Chen said, all mechanisms should be reviewed, and updated and
improved, if necessary.</P>
      <P>"For instance, new criteria should be set for choosing the timing
and range of domestic gas price adjustments in terms of international
crude oil price fluctuations," Chen explained.</P>
      <P>As to whether the MOEA's future plans for adjusting utility rates
should be referred to the Executive Yuan for approval, Chen said the
matter is pending further study.</P>
      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh played a comparatively greater role in
deciding utility-rate adjustments during his one-year term. Media
reports said newly sworn-in Premier Su Tseng-chang may not follow
Hsieh's practice. Chen refrained from offering any speculation about
Su's style in handling the sensitive utilities issue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP, TSU BACK SCRAPPING OF UNIFICATION GUIDELINES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 3 (CNA)
(BY Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Both the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) and its "pan-green" ally -- the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
-- threw support Friday behind the proposal to scrap the National
Unification Guidelines and the National Unification Council (NUC).</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Tsai Huang-liang said President Chen Shui-bian's
recent call for seriously considering abolishing the NUC and the
unification guidelines was aimed at highlighting "Taiwan
consciousness" and safeguarding Taiwan's separate national identity.</P>
      <P>"We support the president's proposal out of our pursuit of making
Taiwan a normal country and our core value of popular sovereignty, "
Tsai said, adding that the scrapping of the unification guidelines
does not involve any change to the Taiwan Strait status quo.</P>
      <P>"What is the status quo? Who has moved to change the status quo?
Whether China's ever-increasing missile deployment targeting Taiwan
and its anti-secession law against Taiwan marked changes to the
status quo?" Tsai asked.</P>
      <P>Noting that the unification guidelines envisage the unification
of Taiwan and China, Tsai said the guidelines were formulated during
the previous Kuomintang administration without the participation of
Taiwan people through democratic procedures.</P>
      <P>"The international society should respect the right of the 23
million Taiwan people to decide the future of Taiwan," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Echoing Tsai's view, TSU Chairman Su Chin-chiang said the DPP
administration should take concrete steps to realize the goal of
scrapping the unification guidelines despite pressure from the United
States, China and the pro-unification opposition "pan-blue alliance"
of the Kuomintang and the People First Party.</P>
      <P>Su further claimed that since China has never dropped its
military threats against Taiwan, the scrapping of the unification
guidelines and the NUC would not mark a violation of President Chen's
"five noes" pledge in his 2000 inaugural address.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA IS POTENTIAL MILITARY COMPETITOR OF U.S.: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Feb. 3 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China is a potential military competitor
likely to counterbalance traditional military advantages enjoyed by
the United States, according to the Quadrennial Defense Review Report
released Friday by the U.S. Department of Defense.</P>
      <P>"Of the major and emerging powers, China has the greatest
potential to compete militarily with the United States and field
disruptive military technologies that could over time offset
traditional U.S. military advantages," the report said.</P>
      <P>China has sped up its military modernization since the
mid-to-late 1990s in response to central leadership demands to
develop military options against scenarios concerning Taiwan,
according to the report.</P>
      <P>China continues to invest heavily in its military to improve its
ability to project power beyond its borders, with the country's
defense spending increasing by more than 10 percent every year since
1996 except 2003, the report said.</P>
      <P>"The pace and scope of China's military build-up already puts
regional military balances at risk," it said.</P>
      <P>According to the report, China is likely to continue making large
investments in high-end, asymmetric military capabilities,
emphasizing electronic and cyber-warfare; counter-space operations;
ballistic and cruise missiles; advanced integrated air defense
systems; next generation torpedoes; advanced submarines; strategic
nuclear strike from modern, sophisticated land- and sea-based
systems; and theater unmanned aerial vehicles for employment by the
Chinese military and for global export.</P>
      <P>It said the United States will seek to encourage China to choose
a path of peaceful economic growth and political liberalization,
rather than military threat and intimidation.</P>
      <P>The United States will also seek to ensure that no foreign power
can dictate the terms of regional or global security and will attempt
to dissuade any military competitor from developing disruptive or
other capabilities that could enable regional hegemony or hostile
action against the United States or other friendly countries, it
added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S POPULATION DENSITY SECOND HIGHEST IN WORLD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  4 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's population density stood at 629
people per square kilometer as of the end of 2005, which was the
world's second highest level among countries with a population of
more than 10 million, according to a report released Saturday by the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics.</P>
      <P>The country's population totalled 22.77 million as of the end of
2005, up 81,000 from the year-earlier level, the report said.</P>
      <P>Of these 81,000, natural increase (births deducting deaths)
accounted for 66,000 and net migration (new immigrants minus
emigrants) accounted for 15,000, with the increase in the number of
foreign spouses and the decrease in the number of people emigrating
overseas being the main contributing factors to the net migration,
the report said.</P>
      <P>The population density of 629 people per square kilometer
compared with 627 people per square kilometer registered at the end
of 2004, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Among countries with a population of more than 10 million, only
Bangladesh has a higher population density than Taiwan at 1,001.5
people per square kilometer. South Korea is third with a population
density of 486.5 people per square kilometer, the report said.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the population density in Taipei City and Kaohsiung
City was near 10,000 people per square kilometer, it said.</P>
      <P>It said a total of 15.8 million people in Taiwan, or 69.4 percent
of the population, live in urban areas, with 30 percent of the
population living in the Taipei and Keelung areas.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AGING FORMER PREMIER IN CRITICAL BUT STABLE CONDITION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 4 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Premier Sun Yun-suan's condition has
stabilized, although he remains listed in critical condition, Chen
Yu-liang, a physician in the cardiology department at the Veterans
General Hospital in Taipei said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The 93-year-old senior advisor to the president was rushed to
hospital on Jan. 30 due to acute myocardial infraction with heart and
lung complications.</P>
      <P>Dr. Chen indicated that ultrasonic tests showed the systole of
Sun's heart is increasingly stronger, while the quantity of his urine
has also been increasing. However, Sun is still suffering from
serious pulmonary edema and renal failure, he added.</P>
      <P>Sun, who is attached to a respirator and on tranquilizer
medication, is now conscious and able to communicate by blinking his
eyes, the doctor said, adding that his blood pressure, heartbeat and
blood oxygen levels are all in the normal range.</P>
      <P>A special team commissioned to treat the former premier is trying
to get rid of water in Sun's lungs by hemodialysis while making
efforts to improve the aging patient's immune system and to lower the
risk of infection.</P>
      <P>Sun served as premier of the Republic of China from 1978 to 1984.
Prior to that, he served as minister of economic affairs for nine
years. He suffered a stroke 20 years ago and has relied on a
wheelchair for mobility since that time.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu visited the hospital where Sun is
staying Saturday morning, but she did not enter his ward for fear of
disturbing him. Lu only talked with Sun's family to inquire about
Sun's condition.</P>
      <P>During their talk, the vice president recalled that she was
jailed during the period when Sun was serving as premier and that Sun
was instrumental in improving the treatment she received while
serving her sentence after learning that she was an Executive Yuan
official.</P>
      <P>Sun's morality and upright character won him the respect of most
Taiwan people during his tenures as a minister and premier, Lu said.</P>

      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on Saturday urged the opposition
parties to be rational and pass major bills in the next legislative
session, which is set to open Feb. 21.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-jun, a DPP caucus whip, said the Executive Yuan's
pushing of administrative works should be continuous, expressing the
hope that the legislature will pass several priority bills that the
Executive Yuan submitted but failed to have passed in the previous

      <P>Chen mentioned in particular the arms procurement project, the 
confirmation of Control Yuan nominees and a package of amendments to
the Organic Law of the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the arms procurement plan has been blocked by
the opposition-controlled legislature a total of 45 times and the
confirmation of Control Yuan nominees 27 times.</P>
      <P>In view of national security and the five-branch governmental
system in the Constitution, he urged the opposition parties to act
rationally and not to block them again.</P>
      <P>He also said that discussions on the restructuring of the
Executive Yuan have been going on for years and that he regrets that
the draft revisions of the Organic Law of the Executive Yuan failed to

    <HEADLINE>EASTERN EUROPE CAN SERVE AS SHORTCUT TO E.U. MARKET FOR TAIWAN: CIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 4 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With plentiful natural and human resources
and cheap land costs, Eastern Europe is a shortcut that Taiwan
businesses can take advantage of to enter the European Union market,
according to a report by the Chung Hua Institute for Economic
Research (CIER).</P>
      <P>The report noted that the entry of 10 countries, including
Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, into the E.U. in 2004
represented a market expansion for Taiwan businesses maintaining
trade with Central and Eastern European countries.</P>
      <P>As customs duties of Eastern European countries that entered the
E.U. have generally declined after E.U. tariff measures became
applicable to them, more Taiwan enterprises should explore business
opportunities there, the report said.</P>
      <P>It pointed out that the abundant natural resources, outstanding
basic industry and high-tech talent, the cheap land and labor costs,
the perfect geographical location, and the preferential policies
offered by Eastern European countries all make the region a shortcut
for Taiwan enterprises intending to gain access to the European
market and develop technology-intensive industries.</P>
      <P>As of the end of December 2004, Taiwan investment projects in
Eastern Europe were mainly located in Poland, the Czech Republic and
Hungary, with electronics and electrical appliance manufacturing
being the major fields of investment. The largest number of these
investment projects -- 18 -- were in Hungary, and the investment
fields ranged from sports equipment and ready-to-wear clothing to
food, bicycles and furniture, according to the report.</P>
      <P>The CIER suggested that the government encourage and assist more
Taiwan businesses to set up operations in Eastern Europe to supply
and serve the vast Western European market.</P>

the nine-chapter living guide which covers such topics as medical
care, marriage, daily life and counseling services.</P>
      <P>The guide is aimed at helping mainland Chinese spouses integrate
into Taiwan society, the officials said.</P>
      <P>"They might have a lot of questions after coming to Taiwan, such

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun on Saturday vowed to do his utmost to win the
crucial legislative elections slated for the end of 2007.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks while speaking to DPP department directors
and their deputies during a two-day camp being held in suburban
Taipei to help forge consensus within the party.</P>
      <P>For the sake of the sustainable development of the party, he said
it is paramount that the party win the legislative elections in 2007,
which will see a new "single seat and two votes" electoral system as
well as the halving of the number of Legislative Yuan seats from the
current 225 to 113.</P>
      <P>"If the DPP only manages to garner 40 seats as predicted by
(former DPP Legislator) Tuan Yi-kang, then this will represent a
heavy defeat for the party, and the consequences will be grave, " he
added.</P>
      <P>Should the party suffer a drubbing in the legislative elections
in December 2007, then it will be very difficult to win the 2008
presidential election, as the two elections are only three or four
months apart, he said.</P>
      <P>"Even if the DPP wins the next presidential election, the
administration will continue to be blocked in pushing its bills and
related budgets if the legislature is controlled by the opposition
parties as it is now," You said.</P>
      <P>"In such a case, not only will the party lose, Taiwan will also
lose," he continued.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the DPP advocates that Taiwan is an
independent, sovereign state, adding that if the helm of the nation
is turned over to the pro-unification main opposition Kuomintang,
then "the consequences will be dire."</P>
      <P>"For this reason, the DPP must not lose in the legislative
elections. Although the current situation is not favorable to the
DPP, we can still win so long as we work hard," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SU-TSAI TICKET FOR 2008 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION TAKING SHAPE: ADVISOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Feb. 3 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Su-Tsai ticket to represent the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the 2008 presidential election
is taking shape, a national policy advisor to President Chen
Shui-bian said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chin Heng-wei was referring to Premier Su Tseng-chang and Vice
Premier Tsai Ing-wen when he gave a report on the latest political
situation in Taiwan to Taiwanese expatriates in the greater
Washington, D.C. area in Virginia after attending the annual National
Prayer Breakfast the previous day.</P>
      <P>Chin said that President Chen's New Year message and his Lunar
New Year speech were aimed at paving the way for the Su-Tsai ticket
to win the election. Both messages have raised widespread concerns.</P>
      <P>Chin said that as far as he knows, the president did not make the
remarks "on a whim" but instead contemplated them for quite some
time. Examination Yuan President Yao Chia-wen called on President
Chen before the latter's Lunar New Year speech, conveying to the
president a resolution to scrap the National Unification Council and 
the National Unification Guidelines passed in the meeting of
the World Taiwanese Congress, an organization formed by pro-Taiwan
independence groups in the United States in December 2000.</P>
      <P>Chin said that the president's two speeches "were a response to
his core supporters."</P>
      <P>He analyzed that the DPP suffered a major setback in the Dec. 3
local elections because it lost many of its "core supporters" by
soliciting middle-of-the-road voters.</P>
      <P>"The core supporters ended up not voting in the elections because
they thought President Chen was not being loyal to them and they
wanted to teach the party a lesson," Chin claimed.</P>
      <P>The lesson the DPP learned from its drubbing in the elections is
that it has to solidify support among its core supporters and then
expand to the middle-of-the-road voters and that if it ignores its
core supporters while tilting toward the middle-of-the-road voters,
it risks losing both of them, Chin said.</P>
      <P>He further said that in Taiwan, where the "pan-green camp" of the
DPP and its ally Taiwan Solidarity Union and the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First Party are so clearly
divided, the middle-of-the-road voters could be the most apathetic
toward politics and the least likely to turn out for voting.</P>
      <P>Such voters tend to vote for candidates that have the better
chance of winning, and they usually vote for specific candidates
instead of particular parties, and "even if you have done your best
to woo them, the effect could be minimal," Chin continued.</P>
      <P>With two years remaining in President Chen's second and final
term, Chin said that Chen's paramount task will be to ensure that
the DPP continues to rule the nation, which he called "an extremely
tough challenge" for the president.</P>
      <P>For this reason, President Chen, when thinking about the possible
candidates to head the new Cabinet, had to choose between whether the
new premier would be an executive director to him or his successor in
2008, and he chose the latter, Chin claimed.</P>
      <P>President Chen's New Year message and Lunar New Year speech were
in fact a response to the party's core supporters, Chin said. He
first wanted to ensure the core supporters would remain loyal before
"releasing power to give Su's Cabinet the room to shine and use Su's 
political performance to expand the party's support base," Chin
observed.</P>
      <P>President Chen said in his New Year address that "proactive
management and effective liberalization" will represent the new
mindset and course of action for Taiwan's future cross-strait
economic and trade policies.</P>
      <P>The president also said the "proactive management and effective
liberalization" policy would replace the "proactive liberalization
and effective management" policy which has been in place since a
consensus was reached in the 2001 Economic Development Advisory
Conference.</P>
      <P>In his speech at a Lunar New Year gathering with his supporters
in the southern county of Tainan Jan. 29, Chen said that now may be
the appropriate time to seriously consider scrapping the National
Unification Guideline and the National Unification Council to signify
Taiwan's unique national identity.</P>
      <P>Chen also came up with two other proposals in the speech --
namely considering applying for United Nations membership under the
name of Taiwan if the official national title "Republic of China"
cannot be used and drafting a new constitution for Taiwan by the end
of this year to be put forth for a referendum in 2007.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NSC STUDYING FEASIBILITY OF SCRAPPING NUC: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  4 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has directed
the National Security Council (NSC) to study the feasibility of doing
away with the National Unification Council (NUC) and the National
Unification Guidelines, a visiting Taiwan official said Friday.</P>
      <P>NSC Deputy Secretary-General Parris Chang, who is currently in
Washington, D.C. to attend the annual U.S. National Prayer Breakfast,
made the revelation during an informal meeting with Chinese-language
media reporters stationed in the U.S. capital.</P>
      <P>Chang said the NSC was not aware in advance that Chen would come
up with the proposal to scrap the NUC and the unification guidelines
on Lunar New Year's Day this past Sunday.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chang said he came to learn of the president's
directive to the NSC on the feasibility study of the proposed NUC
scrapping when he talked with NSC staff in Taipei by phone a couple
of days ago.</P>
      <P>The 15-year-old guidelines spell out a plan for eventual
unification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, and the NUC under
the Presidential Office is tasked to promote realization of that
goal.</P>
      <P>Chen's proposal has drawn strong reaction from U.S. authorities
who said the move could lead to "unilateral changes to the Taiwan
Strait status quo," to which the United States is invariably opposed.</P>
      <P>Chang said U.S. authorities have overreacted to Chen's proposal
which he noted mainly aimed to signify Taiwan's unique national
identity.</P>
      <P>Chang said he has taken advantage of his current visit to
communicate with U.S. officials concerning the issue.</P>
      <P>He also said he doesn't think that the latest rift over the NUC
issue will lead to a repeat of the U.S. president bluntly criticizing
Taiwan's leader in a meeting with a high-ranking Chinese official.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 9, 2003, U.S. President George W. Bush criticized
Taiwan's head of state during the former's meeting with visiting
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao over Chen's insistence on holding a
referendum simultaneously with the 2004 presidential election.</P>
      <P>As Chinese President Hu Jintao is scheduled to make an official
visit to the United States in April, some observers asked Chang if he

Chen's NUC proposal.</P>

    <HEADLINE>UNIFICATION TO REMAIN AN OPTION AFTER NUC ABOLITION: ADVISER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb. 4 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Unification would remain an option for
the people of Taiwan in deciding their country's future ties with
China even if its unification guidelines and related body are
abolished, a presidential adviser from Taiwan said Friday.</P>
      <P>Wu Li-pei, a senior adviser to President Chen Shui-bian who
arrived in Washington, D.C. earlier this week to attend the annual
U.S. National Prayer Breakfast, made the remarks during an informal
meeting with Chinese-language media reporters posted in the U.S.
capital.</P>
      <P>In an effort to alleviate misgivings over Chen's statements on
Lunar New Year's Day that now may be an appropriate time to consider
doing away with the National Unification Council (NUC) and the
National Unification Guidelines to signify Taiwan's unique national
identity, Wu said phasing out the guidelines and the NUC doesn't mean
that Taiwan would reject unification with China.</P>
      <P>"What we want is to let the 23 million Taiwan people decide
Taiwan's future out of their free will, " Wu said, adding that
unification would remain an option.</P>
      <P>Wu said he and other Taiwan delegates to the prayer breakfast
have taken advantage of their visit to communicate with U.S.
officials, congressmen and think tank researchers regarding Chen's
Lunar New Year's Day speech.</P>
      <P>"Through candid and direct communications, both sides have come
to a better understanding of each other's basic stance," Wu said.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, U.S. concerns focused on two questions: Whether
Chen's proposals would be in violation of the "five noes" pledge he
made in his 2000 and 2004 inaugural speeches and whether the
proposals would lead to "unilateral changes" to the Taiwan Strait
status quo.</P>
      <P>Wu said he had reminded U.S. officials of the premise of Chen's
"five noes" pledge.</P>
      <P>"The 'five noes' pledge is based on the premise that China has no
intention to use military force against Taiwan. Since Chen took
office, China's military threats have continued to intensify. Over
the past six years, China has cold-shouldered Chen's repeated call
for dialogue and instead stepped up its saber rattling and divisive
acts against Taiwan," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Wu added, the premise for Chen's "five
noes" pledge no longer exists.</P>
      <P>As to whether Chen's proposals would change the status quo, Wu
said the status quo has actually been changing all the time and
become increasingly unfavorable to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In his view, Wu said China's deployment of missiles targeting
Taiwan and its enactment of a so-called anti-secession law all mark
"unilateral changes" to the status quo.</P>
      <P>Wu said it is regrettable that the United States failed to take
any action against Beijing's such moves while typically reacting
strongly to any Taiwan move regarding cross-strait affairs.</P>
      <P>Noting that democracy allows people to decide their own future,
Wu said he has reminded U.S. officials that the National Unification
Guidelines and the NUC deprive Taiwan people of their right to make
their own choice about Taiwan's future by arbitrarily setting
"unification" as the ultimate national goal.</P>
      <P>The 15-year-old guidelines, formulated during the previous
Kuomintang era, spell out a plan for eventual unification of the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait, and the NUC is tasked to promote that
goal.</P>
      <P>In addition to proposing scrapping the NUC, Chen also suggested
in his Lunar New Year's Day speech delivered during a gathering with
his supporters that the country consider applying for United Nations
membership under the name of Taiwan if the official national title
"Republic of China" cannot be used and draft a new constitution by
the end of this year to be put for a referendum in 2007.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) has imposed a
temporary ban on pork imports from the Netherlands over a dioxin

      <P>"Imports of pork and pig viscera from the Netherlands are
suspended till the matter is clarified and sales of those already in

      <P>The ban came after suspected cases of pig and chicken dioxin
poisoning were reported in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium, the
official said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan didn't import chicken from the three countries and only
imported pork from the Netherlands.</P>
      <P>The three European countries have isolated over 650 farms
suspected of using dioxin-contaminated feed made in Belgium, and the
Netherlands has shut down some 260 farms, according to foreign wire
service reports.</P>
      <P>A Belgian government food safety official said this week that
faulty filters at a chemical plant caused abnormal levels of dioxin
to reach animal feed, but stressed there was no immediate danger to
human health.</P>
      <P>Dioxin, a by-product of garbage burning and industrial
activities, can cause a range of illnesses in human beings, including
cancer, metabolism malfunction, and miscarriages.</P>
      <P>After the DOH imposed the Dutch pork import and sales ban,
Taichung City health officials sealed up 20 tons of Dutch pork ribs
during a spot check on a foodstuff warehouse in an industrial zone of
the central city Saturday.</P>
      <P>Importer told city officials that none of the imported ribs have
been sold in the domestic market.</P>
      <P>City health officials said it will take about one week before
Dutch authorities clarify the suspected dioxin contamination
situation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Council of Agriculture officials said Saturday that
Taiwan's livestock and poultry are in no danger of being contaminated
by dioxin-tainted animal feed from the Netherlands, Belgium and
Germany because Taiwan has not imported the product from the three

      <P>Preparations for the launch of
FORMOSAT-3, Taiwan's third satellite project, have proceeded
smoothly, an official from Taiwan's National Science Council (NSC)
said in Los Angeles Friday.</P>
      <P>NSC Vice Chairman Shieh Ching-jyh made the remarks after
inspecting FORMOSAT-3 launch preparatory work at Vandenberg Air Force
Base in California, where the satellite is scheduled to be launched
in the second half of March.</P>
      <P>Shieh took advantage of the Lunar New Year holiday to travel to
Vandenberg to inspect preparatory work and cheer up working staff at
the U.S. Air Force base.</P>
      <P>"Preparations for the forthcoming FORMOSAT-3 lift-off have
proceeded smoothly as scheduled, " Shieh said, adding that the
international meteorological community is eagerly waiting for the
launch of FORMOSAT-3 because it will be the world's first climate
monitoring and forecasting system using a constellation of six
microsatellites to collect atmospheric remote sensing data for
operational weather prediction.</P>
      <P>The FORMOSAT-3, also named Constellation Observing System for
Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC) , is an international
collaborative project between Taiwan's National Space Program Office

      <P>The satellite's mission will involve the placement of six
microsatellites into six different orbits ranging between 700-800 km
above the earth's surface, Shieh said, adding that the project is an
academic research program with the goal of developing an advanced
system for real-time monitoring of the globe's climate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP TO DEBATE CHINA POLICY IN MARCH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  5 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will hold what it describes as a grand debate in late March,
during which party members will not only debate whether Taiwan should
liberalize or tighten its China policy but will also delve deeply
into all related subjects over which the public are concerned, a
senior party official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-lang, director of the party's Department of Culture
and Information, said DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and other party
executives emerged from a two-day "consensus-forging session" with a
decision to stage a thorough debate on what kind of China policy the
party ought to adopt. Details about the debate process are still
being mapped out, Tsai noted.</P>
      <P>The party plans to hold the debate at a time when President Chen
Shui-bian's recent statements about "active management" of cross-
Taiwan Strait relations and "seriously considering" abolishing the
National Unification Council and Guidelines have fanned controversy
both at home and in the United States.</P>
      <P>Tsai did not elaborate on the subjects to be debated, but local
businesses are concerned about the prospects of their investments in
China, while the public are worried about jobs, education, health
care and social order.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the DPP, which has been in power since 2000, will
celebrate its 20th anniversary this fall, an occasion for the party
to review is policy records and come up with new policy proposals in
order, he said, to "regain public confidence and support."</P>
      <P>He said one priority for the party will be a by-election in March

    <HEADLINE>FM REBUTS REPORT ON U.S. ANGER WITH ROC PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 5 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Huang Chih-fang
rebutted as "groundless" Sunday a report from the United States that
claimed U.S. President George Bush was angered by President Chen
Shui-bian's statement about the scrapping of Taiwan's National
Unification Council.</P>
      <P>The minister, who took office Jan. 25, said his office is
communicating with Washington over some issues of concern to the
United States, issues on which there are what he described as
"differences in perception" between the two sides, but he claimed
that bilateral ties are not in any danger.</P>
      <P>Huang made the statement after the local China Times newspaper
quoted a Nilson Report from California as saying that Bush was angry
after being briefed by U.S. officials on Chen's Jan. 29 statement
that his administration is pushing for Taiwan's U.N. access under the
name of Taiwan, crafting a new constitution and considering the
possibility of scrapping the National Unification Council.</P>
      <P>The report quoted Bush as questioning: "He did it again, after
what happened last time?" referring to Chen's 2003 decision to call a
national referendum in spite of Washington's disapproval.</P>
      <P>Huang said his office checked with senior U.S. officials about
the authenticity of the Nilson report before local newspapers broke
the news and claimed that the report is incorrect and that Bush was
not irritated by Chen's statements.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the report cast a cloud over ties between the heads
of state of Taiwan and the United States, the minister said his
office had an obligation to rebut it.</P>
      <P>Huang, who served as Chen's deputy chief of staff before taking
the reins of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, admitted that there are
differences between Taipei and Washington in the perception of Chen's
statements, claiming that U.S. officials "have difficulty grasping"
the rapidly changing chemistry between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Huang said he told officials from the American Institute in
Taiwan (AIT) -- the de-facto U.S. embassy in Taiwan -- that Chen's
statement reflects his worries about the cross-strait situation after
Beijing enacted its Anti-Session Law last March, in which China
provided itself with a "legal basis" for the possible use of force
against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Anonymous senior Foreign Ministry officials said Huang met with
Danna Shell Smith, acting AIT chief, twice in the last three days,
and made it clear that the proposal to do away with the National
Unification Council is still being studied by the National Security
Council and that Taiwan has no intention of catching Washington
off-guard by airing the idea without prior consultation.</P>
      <P>The official said Huang also claimed to AIT officials that it is
China, not Taiwan, that has changed the status quo across the strait.</P>
      <P>The officials said Taipei will not worry about Chinese President
Hu Jintao's visit to Washington in April, as long as it can convince
the United States that Chen did not mean to give Washington any
trouble as a result of his Jan. 29 statement.</P>

      <P>Former Premier Sun Yun-suan, who has been
hospitalized since Jan. 30, showed some improvement in his pulmonary
edema Sunday but was still listed in critical condition, according to
doctors at the Veterans General Hospital in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The 93-year-old senior adviser to the president has been
receiving treatment for an acute myocardial infraction with heart and
lung complications. An X-ray Sunday showed that his pulmonary edema
had improved, but his medical team was still keeping him in intensive
care.</P>
      <P>Sun's blood pressure, heartbeat, temperature and blood oxygen
levels remained within normal ranges, although he was still on an
artificial respirator.</P>
      <P>The doctors said they were using tranquilizers and cardiac drugs
to keep Sun's condition stable but that he was conscious and able to
communicate by blinking.</P>
      <P>Sun was premier from 1978 to 1984. Prior to that, he served as
minister of economic affairs for nine years. He suffered a stroke 20
years ago and has relied on a wheelchair for mobility since then.</P>
      <P>Sun was rushed to National Taiwan University Hospital Jan. 30

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO REDUCE DEPENDENCE ON IMPORTED OIL: BUREAU OF ENERGY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  5  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will continue to follow the
strategies set in the 2005 national energy conference and try to
reduce its dependence on imported oil, the Bureau of Energy under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs said Sunday.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the bureau pointed out that Taiwan relies on
imported energy for 98 percent of its energy needs and that imported
oil accounts for nearly 51 percent of Taiwan's energy consumption.</P>
      <P>He said the government will try to meet the target set at the
national energy conference in June last year that by 2025, Taiwan's
reliance on imported oil should be reduced to between 30 percent and
31 percent of the nation's total energy needs.</P>
      <P>Other targets set in the 2005 meeting include increasing energy
generated from coal from 41 percent to 45 percent of Taiwan's total
energy supply by 2025, with natural gas accounting for 16 percent to
19 percent, followed by renewable energy at 5 percent to 7 percent
and nuclear energy at 4 percent.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that to achieve these targets, the bureau will
encourage the use of natural gas, import clean coal technology, and
develop renewable forms of energy such as solar, wind, hydro and
geothermal power.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Pao-lang, president of the state-run Chinese
Petroleum Corp. (CPC) , said petroleum accounts for 50.7 percent of
Taiwan's total energy needs and that 65 percent of the 2.3 billion
barrels of oil imported by the CPC in the January-November period of
last year came from the Middle East.</P>
      <P>Chen said the CPC will try to diversify its oil supply sources by
stepping up cooperation with international oil exploration companies
in areas other than the Middle East, such as the United States,
Ecuador, Indonesia, Australia, Venezuela and Chad.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KAOHSIUNG PORT LOSING LUSTERBy   Flor   WangCNA staff writer</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 5 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung port -- Taiwan's largest port and
once the world's third-busiest in terms of container traffic -- is
increasingly losing its transshipment hub status in the Asia-Pacific
region amid rising rivalry from ports in neighboring countries, an
investigation has found.</P>
      <P>The study led by Wu Jung-kui, a professor at the Northern Taiwan
Institute of Science and Technology, on the outlooks for the six
leading ports in the region shows that the southern Taiwan port ranks
bottom of the list, with Hong Kong, Singapore, Shanghai, Shenzhen and
Busan ahead of it, in that order.</P>
      <P>The study warned that Kaohsiung port will see its operations
further affected if the government fails to work out effective
countermeasures. In 2005, the handling volume at the port dropped for
the first time, showing a 2.5 percent shrinkage for a year on year
reduction, it pointed out.</P>
      <P>Although the number of Asia-Europe and Asia-America large
container shipping lanes has risen from 44 to 96 over the past 11
years, the report said that Kaohsiung port dealt with the smallest
portion -- 11 percent on average -- of the containers loaded and
unloaded among the six ports.</P>
      <P>According to the study, Hong Kong dealt with the most at 24
percent, followed by Singapore's 22 percent, Shanghai's 16 percent
and Shenzhen's 15 percent.</P>
      <P>If its sluggishness continues, Kaohsiung port is estimated to be
handling only 8 percent by 2010, the study forecast, predicting that
Shenzhen and Shanghai will replace Hong Kong and Singapore for the
first time to become the world's largest and second-largest container
ports, respectively, by 2008, with Busan and Kaohsiung in the bottom
two spots.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Shanghai has vowed to overtake Hong Kong as the
world's largest container port by 2010, hoping to handle 30 million
twenty-foot equivalent containers, since the city inaugurated its
first deepwater port on the offshore Yangshan islands in mid-December
last year.</P>
      <P>Yangshan port, construction of which is slated to be finished in
2020, will help Shanghai handle the world's largest number of
containers, according to media reports.</P>
      <P>In the face of the tough challenge ahead, Hong Kong has responded
with various countermeasures, including slashing port fees and
simplifying procedures for ships entering the port from the beginning
of 2006.</P>
      <P>Given the alarming situation, the number of containers that
Kaohsiung port will handle is expected to decline every year and the
port will lose its key pivotal importance for the world's shipping
companies at a time when ports in neighboring countries and areas, in
particular China, are catching up.</P>
      <P>Lin Chih-ming, director of the Department of Navigation and
Aviation under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications,
said that the problem is an economic issue rather than just a matter
of the port itself.</P>
      <P>Lin also expressed worry that Kaohsiung port will have even fewer
containers to deal with next year after three deepwater wharfs at
Xiamen port in China's Fujian Province begin operations.</P>
      <P>Since early last year, a free trade zone at Kaohsiung port
started operations, in which eight companies have opened up shop. In
addition, the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau is also encouraging warehousing
and distribution businesses to move into the zone to help the port
step up its competitive edge.</P>
      <P>As competition seems set to remain aggressive for Kaohsiung port
in the years to come, it is also necessary to assess the functions of
its free trade port zone, researchers have said.</P>

      <P>Two senior officials of the Executive Yuan's
Fair Trade Commission (FTC) will represent Chinese Taipei Thursday at
a peer review session of the Paris-based Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development's (OECD) Global Forum on Competition,
officials said Sunday.</P>
      <P>FTC Chairman Hwang Tzong-leh and commission member Wang Wen-yu
said they are honored to represent Taiwan at the Paris meeting, which
is aimed at helping the country adopt the best paradigms in policy
making so that it can abide by international norms and standards.</P>
      <P>OECD data shows that Chinese Taipei will present two reports at
the Feb. 8-9 forum organized by the OECD Directorate for Financial
and Enterprise Affairs -- one to the Roundtable on Prosecuting
Cartels without Direct Evidence of Agreement and the other on
"Concerted Action in the Cable TV Sector" in the Cartel Case Studies
session. </P>
      <P>Hwang will be making the reports and Wang will use two hours to
answer questions from 70-odd participating countries, Hwang said.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan will be the third non-OECD member country to
be invited to a peer review session, after South Africa and Russia.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been invited because FTC law-enforcement records have
won international recognition and the OECD considers the FTC to be
capable of providing technical assistance in the area of implementing
fair trade laws to the international community, he added.</P>
      <P>A peer review report will be published on the OECD Web site after
the Chinese Taipei delegates pass the review. The FTC is scheduled to
hold a press meeting in June to explain the process in conjunction
with an international seminar on competitive policy and fair trade
laws, which will be attended by delegates from the OECD.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI DEPUTY MAYOR WILL NOT QUIT POST FOR MAYORAL BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  5 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Deputy Mayor Yeh Chin-chuan said
Sunday that he will not quit his current post because of his bid for
the mayorship of Taipei.</P>
      <P>Yeh, a member of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) who announced
his candidacy for Taipei mayor two weeks ago, was reacting to a
proposal by KMT Legislator Tsai Chen-yuan that Yeh should quit his
job as deputy mayor for fear that he might use city government
resources to help his mayoral bid.</P>
      <P>It is believed that Tsai himself is interested in seeking the KMT
nomination for Taipei mayor, although he has not formally announced
his candidacy.</P>
      <P>Yeh assured reporters that he will not utilize city government
resources to boost his chances of winning the KMT nomination in the
party primary.</P>
      <P>"If I were to do something like that, the residents of Taipei
would despise me and would not vote for me," he said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Yeh added, he will not consider the suggestion that he
quit his current post as deputy mayor.</P>
      <P>So far, at least four other people from the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party (PFP) have announced
their candidacy for Taipei mayor -- KMT legislators John Chiang and
Ting Shou-chung, PFP Chairman James Soong and the former head of the
Environmental Protection Administration, Hau Lung-ping, who recently
left the New Party and joined the KMT.</P>
      <P>Yeh and the other KMT candidates will vie in a party primary for
the nomination and then run against candidates of other political
parties in the mayoral election at the end of the year. It is unclear
whether the KMT and the PFP will present a single candidate to
represent the "pan-blue alliance" in the election.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  5 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Relations between Taipei and Washington
remain intact despite U.S. concerns about President Chen Shui-bian's
Jan. 29 statement that he is considering abolishing the National
Unification Council, the president's chief aide Tan Sun Chen said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>In a response to journalists' questions about the controversy
resulting from Chen's statement, Tan Sun Chen said it is only natural
that the two sides will not agree with each other on everything
because of their different national interests.</P>
      <P>The former minister of foreign affairs was asked to comment on a
local newspaper report that U.S. President George Bush was angered by
Chen Shui-bian's claims, considering them betrayal to his promises
that he will not change the status quo in terms of Taiwan's ties with
China.</P>
      <P>Tan Sun Chen said he was unaware that Bush was displeased with
Chen's statement, but said any misunderstanding between Taipei and
Washington can be dispelled via repeated communication.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has explained
Taiwan's stance on the issue to officials at the American Institute
in Taiwan, while Wu Li-pei, a senior adviser to the president, and
Parris Chang, deputy secretary-general of the National Secretary
Council, who are in Washington, D.C. to attend the National Prayer
Breakfast, have also been asked to help explain Taiwan's position on
the issue.</P>
      <P>The National Unification Council, set up in 1990, is supposed to
promote the eventual unification of Taiwan and China, which was
considered by Beijing to be a cornerstone in the relationship between
it and Taiwan. Chen, who is the nominative head of the council, has
never called it into session since he took office in 2000.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An international conference on tobacco
control is to open in Geneva Monday but Taiwan, which has completed
relevant legislation and wants to attend, is being excluded, a senior
government official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Shen Pei-hwang, director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) Department of Treaty and Legal Affairs, urged the United
Nations to accept Taiwan's deposit of its agreement to join the
convention by making good on its word that health goes beyond
national boundaries.</P>
      <P>He said the Legislative Yuan approved a government proposal to
join the WHO Framework Convention of Tobacco Control (FCTC) Jan. 14,
2005, a legislative procedure that was later ratified by President
Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The World Health Organization approved the FCTC, which is aimed
at reducing tobacco damage to human health, in May 2003 and began
accepting contracting parties Feb. 27, 2005. Any country that has
completed legislative procedures to join is supposed to be
automatically accepted as a contracting party.</P>
      <P>A MOFA spokesman said the U.N. Secretariat is responsible for
accepting deposits of contracting parties' agreements to join the
FCTC, but claimed it has "ignored" Taiwan's intention to make the
deposit. In fact, the U.N. does not recognize Taiwan as a country.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials said Taiwan has been trying hard to become an
observer at the World Health Assembly in a bid to make substantive
contributions to the international health community -- anti-smoking
campaigns and legislation being part of that effort.</P>
      <P>The first conference of the parties to FCTC will be held Feb.
2-17 in Geneva, Switzerland with more than 50 contracting parties and
non-governmental organizations participating. They are scheduled to
discuss the establishment of a permanent secretariat, funding and
other operation issues.</P>
      <P>The FCTC is the WHO's only international convention. After going

    <HEADLINE>CHINA LINKS, INVESTIGATION POWER TOP ISSUES ON LEGISLATIVE AGENDA: PFP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  5  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opening direct links with China and
empowering the Legislative Yuan with the power to probe cases of
alleged corruption will be the top issues to be promoted by the
opposition People First Party (PFP) during the next legislative
session, a party spokesman said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Daniel Y.C. Huang, a PFP legislative caucus whip, said that the
party will make all-out efforts to advocate amendments to the
relevant laws in the hope of helping revive Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Stating that the PFP hopes to put direct trade, transport and
mail services across the Taiwan Strait -- the so-called direct three
links -- in place by the end of this year, Huang said that it is
vital to revise the Statute Governing the Relations Between the
People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area.</P>
      <P>According to the PFP's revised version, the opening of the
direct three links will be realized in three phases, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The first will be the establishment of direct air links between
Taipei and Shanghai on a trial basis for one year. The second will
allow for direct flights between Taipei and Kaohsiung connecting to
five destinations in China on an experimental basis, and the third
will be opening full direct transport links across the strait and
other direct links approved by the Legislative Yuan, he explained.</P>
      <P>Another priority is to amend the law governing the Legislative
Yuan's authority to empower it with the power to summon ranking
government officials, including the president, to testify at the
legislature, he added, adding that this will give the Legislative
Yuan more teeth to investigate government officials suspected of
involvement in corruption.</P>
      <P>Huang's remarks about the PFP's line in the new legislative
session that will begin Feb. 21 came after PFP Chairman James Soong
said late last week that the party will refrain from political
wrangling and will walk its own path after various high-profile PFP
lawmakers ditched the party to join the main opposition Kuomintang in
late January under what they called "high public expectations."</P>
      <P>The KMT, the PFP and the New Party form the "pan blue alliance"
against the "pan green camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party and the Taiwan Solidarity Union.</P>
      <P>Political observers said that bills related to the direct three
links, a major arms procurement package and a nomination list
referred by President Chen Shui-bian for Control Yuan members will be
the center of wrangling among lawmakers at the next legislative
session.</P>
      <P>A four-month negotiation period will come to an end in the coming
session and a law amendment on the direct three links will have to be
put to a vote if lawmakers still fail to reach agreement on the
issue.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou has threatened to call a referendum on
setting up direct links should the government still refuse to do so
after legislators vote to impose a law amendment.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the major arms procurement bill has been blocked by
"pan blue" lawmakers 45 times, and the president's nomination list
for Control Yuan members 27 times, a situation that "pan green"
legislators have repeatedly criticized as a violation of the nation's
five-branch government system.</P>
      <P>As both Ma and Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng have
revealed their intentions to settle the two long- stalled bills in
the next legislative session, the Legislative Yuan hopefully will
have a chance of breaking the current deadlock, analysts said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOI LAUNCHES SWEEPING CAMPAIGN AGAINST SOURCES OF SIX MAJOR CRIMES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 5 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>When the nation returns to work Monday after
the lunar New Year holiday, people will see a conspicuous increase in
the presence of police on the streets as the Ministry of the Interior
has launched a sweeping campaign against the very sources of "six
major crimes" such as drug dealing and gun remodeling.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Li Yi-yang announced launching the "Cleansing
Sources" campaign at a press conference Sunday along with his two
deputies, Yen Wan-chin and Chien Tai-lang, as well as National Police
Administration Director General Hsieh Yin-tang and Criminal
Investigation Bureau Commissioner Hou You-yi.</P>
      <P>Li said all of the nation's 60,000-strong police force were being
mobilized to strike at drug making plants, gun remodeling factories,
gambling dens, car breaking yards, drug pushing shops and gambling
game parlors -- what he called the six sources of major crimes.</P>
      <P>He said, the police force has been on duty during the lunar New
Year holiday, and yet robbing of police guns, bank robbing and even
random kidnapping still happened. He therefore called a high-level
meeting to map out a strategy for fighting crime.</P>
      <P>Li said recent robberies are closely related to the six "criminal
sources" as statistics show that 47 percent of robbers have drug
offense records, 38 percent of burglars also have drug offense

    <HEADLINE>MOEA TO FUND 3G PHONE CERTIFICATION PROJECT</HEADLINE>

(By Joy Wan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is set to establish Asia's first test
lab for third generation (3G) phones in two years, which is expected
to save up to NT$1.5 million per model of cell phone, compared to
having them tested abroad, a company official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The Department of Industrial Technology under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) announced Saturday that it will subsidize a
plan by SGS Taiwan Ltd., a branch of Swiss-based SGS SA which covers
laboratory testing and inspection, to build 3G-WCDMA testing
facilities in Taiwan. </P>
      <P>The lab will allow domestically-made 3G phones to be tested and
certified in Taiwan, a move that will save an estimated NT$1 million
to NT$1.5 million per type of cell phone, in comparison with sending
the gadgets to Europe or the United States for certification, SGS
Taiwan said. </P>
      <P>The lab, which will first have to pass a series of tests by the
global certification forum and the PCS type certification review
board before beginning operations, is also expected to attract orders
from outside Taiwan and undertake certification work for foreign
brands, the company said. </P>
      <P>The Department of Industrial Technology said that none of the
current 3G-WCDMA testing facilities in Asia measure up to Western
standards. This fact, coupled with the growing trend of customized 3G
phones, has made establishing an advanced test lab in the region a
necessity. </P>
      <P>The establishment of the lab will help Taiwan fill this gap in 3G
phone testing, inspection and verification services, the department
said.</P>

complete investigations into the complaint within a certain period a

      <P>Ma said that the Legislative Yuan will remain as the country's

    <HEADLINE>CHINA INVESTMENT POLICY SHOULD BE SOLID: BUSINESS COMMUNITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  6 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's China investment policy
should be clear and should contain concrete measures feasible for
Taiwan companies to follow, business leaders urged Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Wu-hsiung, vice chairman of the Chinese National Federation
of Industries (CNFI), made the call in a speech at a Chinese New Year
celebration gathering with China-based Taiwan businessmen at which
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu was also in
attendance.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed hope that the Cabinet led by Premier Su
Tseng-chang will explore wider horizons for further development in
Taiwan-China trade and economic ties and that the two sides will soon
start economic talks based on the model set by recent negotiations on
the direct cross-Taiwan Strait Lunar New Year holiday charter flights.</P>
      <P>He urged the government to build a more favorable and effective
environment for Taiwan businesses to deploy around the world by
opening direct trade, transport and mail links with China.</P>
      <P>Touching on the "active management, effective opening" China
investment policy laid out by President Chen Shui-bian in his New
Year's Day speech, he said that such an ambiguous and politically
motivated statement will only make it hard for Taiwan companies to
comply with.</P>
      <P>In addition, the government should periodically review its
relevant policies and measures in line with actual situations, he
suggested, pointing out that otherwise, it will be difficult for the
government to gain understanding and consensus from the business
community.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, MAC chairman Wu said that the
government's shift to the "active management, effective opening"
China investment policy is not designed to lock Taiwan businesses at
home, but rather its major aim is to allow for better coordination
among relevant government agencies and have them take full charge of
managing Taiwan investment in China to help enterprises reduce their
risk in that volatile market.</P>
      <P>However, Yeh Hui-teh, chairman of the Taiwan businessmen's
association in Shanghai, pointed out that it is undeniable that
President Chen's Jan. 29 remarks will have a negative impact on the
operations of Taiwan businessmen in China.</P>
      <P>The president's remarks on Chinese New Year's Day that he might
seriously consider scrapping the National Unification Council and the
Guidelines for National Unification as China has not yet dropped its
military threats against Taiwan were also just too rash, he said,
adding that Chen's words will cause cross-strait relations to
deteriorate even further.</P>
      <P>Cheng Jung-wen, chairman of the Taiwan businessmen's association
in Shenzhen, said that it is unnecessary for the government to air
such words charged with political connotations that could ruin the
chances for cross-strait compromise. "More economics and less saliva"
would best benefit Taiwan businessmen, he said.</P>
      <P>Most other Taiwan businessmen with operations in China attending
a seminar a day earlier also voiced similar viewpoints.</P>
      <P>They suggested that the opposition "pan blue alliance" and the
"pan green camp" should seek compromise instead of confrontation,
pointing out that businessmen crave direct links across the strait
and a more open policy for investment and doing business in China --
which could be used as a bridge and a base for Taiwan companies
seeking globalization.</P>
      <P>Regardless of what the government's China investment policy
focuses on, the government should set visionary and clear game rules
to better lead Taiwan enterprises, they said, contending that the two
sides should devote their energy to creating conditions for better
economic exchanges.</P>
      <P>But they warned that, attracted by the growing Chinese market,
more and more small and medium sized Taiwan businesses have also
moved their research and development operations to China, adding that
the knowledge gap between the two sides is growing smaller and
smaller.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP WANTS INTERNAL `PAN-BLUE' COORDINATION ON ARMS PROCUREMENT DEAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  6 (CNA)
(By Debby Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition People First Party (PFP)
official said Monday that the party wants Legislative Yuan Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng to coordinate between the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
and the PFP on the U.S. arms procurement deal before starting a
cross-caucus negotiation in the legislature.</P>
      <P>PFP Policy Research Center Director Chang Hsien-yao said the PFP
will not guarantee to accept completely the KMT's position on the
procurement deal.</P>
      <P>"As long as the government cannot clarify whether we are paying
more than necessary for the deal, the PFP will not change its
existing position, but recognizes the necessity for Taiwan to have
self-defense capabilities," Chang said.</P>
      <P>"President Chen Shui-bian's Chinese New Year remarks regarding
the abolition of the National Unification Council have caused
turbulence and conflict in cross-Taiwan Strait relations and have
affected regional security. If this issue does not get resolved
first, it will not help no matter how many weapons we purchase, "
Chang said.</P>
      <P>He made the statement after he met with Wang earlier in the day
to discuss the arms procurement deal, the Control Yuan member
nominations, cross-strait relations and various legislative affairs.
Wang also met with KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou that day to
discuss the arms procurement deal.</P>
      <P>"It is expected that there will be an outcome to the arms
procurement deal in March or April, although the outcome might not be
completely satisfying to some," Wang said after he met with Ma.</P>
      <P>Wang said he and Ma agreed that the KMT will release its position
paper on the deal in late February and will then discuss it with
other opposition parties. Wang said he will convene a cross-caucus
negotiation after the opposition parties agree on a unified position.</P>
      <P>Wang said there might also be a breakthrough on the controversial
Control Yuan member nominations in the upcoming legislative session.</P>
      <P>"Eliminating the controversies stemming from these two bills will
improve domestic political harmony and stability," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Wang is also expected to meet with Chen to brief him on the U.S.
position on the arms procurement deal. Wang visited Washington and
discussed various issues with heavyweight U.S. politicians during
a stopover on a trip he made to attend the Honduran presidential
inauguration as Chen's envoy just before Chinese New Year.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Huang Chih-fang
said Monday that communications with the United States over
President Chen Shui-bian's proposal to consider scrapping the
National Unification Council (NUC) and the National Unification
Guidelines have been "rational and amiable."</P>
      <P>Huang said that David Ta-wei lee, the Republic of China
representative to the United States, has been instructed to
communicate with Washington over Chen's Jan. 29 Lunar New Year
message.</P>
      <P>Huang said he also communicated with Dana Shell Smith, acting
director of the American Institute in Taiwan, the de facto U.S.
embassy in Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>"The communications have been rational and in an amiable
atmosphere," Huang said.</P>
      <P>He claimed that at issue is a "perception gap" between Taiwan and
the United Stats over whether Chen's message was intended to change
the status quo of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has stressed to Washington that Taiwan shares the stance
of the United States that the status quo should be maintained, but is
concerned that after China enacted its Anti-Secession Law in March
2005, as well as various political changes since then, the
cross-strait situation is tilting in favor of China, which will
probably change the cross-strait status quo, Huang said.</P>
      <P>"Chen's message should be read in this context, " said Huang, who
added that "this also reflected the worries of many people in
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Faced with the changes in the Taiwan Strait, Huang claimed that
Washington "might not be able to keep abreast of the latest
developments. This is why there is a gap in perception requiring
communication on both sides," he added.</P>
      <P>He also said that during his communications, he was unaware
that the U.S. was infuriated by Chen's remarks and said the Foreign
Affairs Ministry has checked with senior U.S. officials, who have
said the reports are unfounded.</P>
      <P>A Taiwan newspaper quoted Sunday a Nelson Report from the United
States as claiming that Bush was infuriated by Chen's proposal to
abolish the NUC.</P>

      <P>Chen Wen-tsung, director of the Department of Public Affairs

      <P>A businessman who grew up in a fishing
village in southern Taiwan has come closer to realizing his dream of
marketing his own brand-name diamond products in the international
market, after more than 20 years in the business.</P>
      <P>Chang An-jan said he chose the diamond market because it can
"carry the biggest value in the smallest size" and he named his
product "Billion Diamond" because billion is a "huge number" that
stands for the value of the precious stone.</P>
      <P>Chang started with contract work before becoming a wholesale
importer of diamonds. He then studied gem appraisal in Japan and
learned cutting and other techniques.</P>
      <P>Now he is the boss of more than 10 designers and 150 employees
working on the "Billion Diamond" products that he has registered for
patent rights in the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Dubai and other
countries. Annual sales are in the tens of millions of NT dollars.</P>
      <P>"Brand names are a trend in the global market, representing value
and quality. We have to create our own brand names in order to remain
competitive on the world market," he said.</P>
      <P>Diamonds are expensive but they are not daily necessities, so
Chang expects people to look at them as a vehicle or target for
investment, in addition to a jewel.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A lawmaker of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) continued Monday to take Taiwan's
representative to Washington David Ta-wei Lee to task for allegedly
failing to do his duty in allaying U.S. concerns over President Chen
Shui-bian's proposal to consider getting rid of the National
Unification Council (NUC) and the National Unification Guidelines.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Trong Chai fired a similar salvo against Lee the
previous day. In rebuttal, Lee said that he had communicated
repeatedly with U.S. officials over the past week.</P>
      <P>But Chai said that Lee should also work with the media, including
sending letters and holding news conferences, claiming that by so
doing, the media "will report in favor of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Lee also failed to invite U.S. think tanks, academics and
congressmen to speak up for Taiwan at critical moments, which Chai
claimed is "dereliction of duty."</P>
      <P>Chai said that if Lee fails to do everything he says, Lee is

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMISTS SUGGEST GOVERNMENT BUILD TAIWAN BUSINESS ZONE IN INDIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  6 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the government's interest in opening
the India market, a report from the Chunghua Institution for Economic
Research (CIER) suggests that the best way to invest in the emerging
South Asian economy is to construct a business colony there.</P>
      <P>Media reports have said the Ministry of Economic Affairs will try
to persuade Taiwanese enterprises to develop the India market as part
of its efforts to disperse overseas Taiwanese investment, which is
overwhelmingly concentrated in China.</P>
      <P>The CIER has conducted research aimed at initiating strategies
for Taiwan-India trade and economic cooperation, under the commission
of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, CIER executives
said Monday.</P>
      <P>The report indicates that India has become a new regional
"battlefield," where brand-name Taiwanese businesses such as Acer and
D-Link are competing for market share in a country in which large
areas have not yet experienced the popularity of electronic products
such as computers and mobile phones.</P>
      <P>There is a new group of potential consumers emerging in the South
Asian country following economic reforms. The CIER report estimates
that there are more than 300 million middle-class consumers in the
nation who can afford electronic household appliances ranging from
air conditioners to cameras.</P>
      <P>This group is believed to be the key factor that will accelerate
India's domestic economic development, the report says.</P>
      <P>According to a Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC) report by
Goldman Sachs, a global investment banking and securities company,
the economic growth rate of India is estimated to fall between 6.1
percent and 5.2 percent on average in 2005-2050, while the country's
national income will surge to US$17,000 in 2050 from the US$486 of
2003.</P>
      <P>Despite the incentives, there are disadvantages in the
development of the market, as the India market is still strictly
controlled by the government.</P>
      <P>In the field of investment, India performs well in software
design and development under foreign contracts, and its government
offers preferential treatment to export-oriented industries. However,
problems including a shortage of basic establishments, government
inefficiency and cultural differences, as well as a complicated wage
system, are all big challenges for foreign investment.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the problem of general production costs in India
being about 30 percent higher than that in China is expected to be
the biggest barrier for Taiwan businessmen, the CIER report says.</P>
      <P>The report suggests that if the government is determined to push
for investment in India, it would be best to plan and build a
Taiwanese business zone there and encourage enterprises to invest
there.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The consumer price index (CPI) recorded a
year-on-year increase of 2.65 percent in January, mainly because of
the increase of food prices during the Lunar New Year holiday, the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS)
announced Monday.</P>
      <P>Although the increase represents a new high since last November,
DGBAS officials said that if the seasonal factors causing higher
prices of fruit, vegetables and various service fees were to
be deducted, the increase would be only 1.2 percent, which they termed
"modest."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in view of the high world oil prices, the officials
estimated that if domestic petroleum prices are raised by 10 percent,
the direct impact on the CPI will be an increase of 0.2 percentage
points.</P>
      <P>They predicted that the annual increase of the CPI for 2006 will
be 1.5 percent unless domestic petroleum prices are raised by 10
percent, in which case the annual CPI increase will rise to
1.7 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FREQUENT AMENDMENTS TO CONSTITUTION NO GOOD: KMT CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Too frequent amendments to the Constitution
are no good and will only reduce the people's respect for it, main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Monday.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while answering questions from reporters
about a media report that the opposition People First Party (PFP) and
the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) will work jointly to promote a
constitutional amendment to alter the current "dual-head" government
system to a parliamentary one.</P>
      <P>Ma claimed that he had no knowledge of the report and said that
any changes to the government system must be made through
constitutional amendments and endorsed by at least three-quarters of
the lawmakers and approved by the people in a referendum.</P>
      <P>But he pointed out that the key point for the government is to
act according to the Constitution and that too frequent
constitutional revisions will only lose people's respect. The
existing constitution has been amended seven times -- a large number
compared with other countries.</P>
      <P>According to KMT lawmaker Kuo Su-chun, the reported PFP intent is
aimed at testing public reaction and trying to open the way for
forging a climate for change, she said.</P>
      <P>PFP lawmaker Liu Wen-hsiung said that the PFP's intention to set
up a parliament-centered government system for Taiwan is not meant to
crowd out Ma -- one of the likely hopefuls in the 2008 presidential
election -- who enjoys strong public support.</P>
      <P>Rather, it is proposed to improve the government's performance
since the government led by President Chen Shui-bian has performed so
poorly over the past five years. </P>
      <P>Echoing Liu's view, PFP lawmaker Lee Hong-jyun said that the PFP
favors a parliamentary government system to clear up the current
political mess arising from the "dual-head" system. Since Chen, a
member of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , came to power in
2000, he has replaced five premiers, Lee said, adding that the
president has far too much power.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun said that the ruling party is hoping for
a new constitution that will create an accountable government and
cement Taiwan's peace and prosperity.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Chuang Suo-hang criticized the current "dual-head"
government system as "dubious, " adding that the DPP will not oppose
constitutional amendments that have acquired national consensus to
build a sound government system.</P>
      <P>TSU Chairman Su Ching-chiang said that the party has already set
up a panel to promote its own version of a new constitution.</P>
      <P>The TSU is slated to call public meetings on Feb. 28 and in
March, in which those interested are welcome to take part in
discussions on a new constitution, he added.</P>

      <P>The 2006 International Summit of Waterfront
Cities will be held in Kaohsiung City, southern Taiwan, Feb. 10-11,
to discuss strategies for developing city coalitions amid an era of
globalization, Kaohsiung officials said Monday.</P>

      <P>The summit will have the participation of representatives from
Busan, South Korea; Hamburg, Germany; Seattle and San Antonio, United
States; Vancouver, Canada; Brisbane, Australia; and Thessalonica,
Greece, officials said.
Officials from Thailand's Bangkok and Japan's Yokohama originally

elections and other factors.</P>
      <P>Yeh expressed the hope that the forum will help Kaohsiung City --
which has already transformed from a highly industrialized port city
into one that also boasts riverside views and beautiful landscapes --
to be further integrated into the global village.</P>
      <P>Hailing the Kaohsiung City government's efforts in globalization,
Tsai also extended the city council's support to make Kaohsiung the
most beautiful city in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During the two-day forum, city representatives from around the
world will discuss topics including global trends in city alliance,
visions of waterfront cities, city development, industrial
transformation and competitiveness.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CPC ASSESSING FEASIBILITY OF SETTING UP OIL REFINERY IN INDIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC)
has not reached a decision yet on whether to set up an oil refinery
in India because the company is still assessing the plan's
feasibility, a CPC spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman made the remarks in response to press queries about
the Ministry of Economic Affairs' policy of helping Taiwanese
enterprises invest in India.</P>
      <P>He acknowledged that the Indian side had inquired about the CPC's
interest in setting up an oil refinery in India.</P>
      <P>The CPC has not ruled out the possibility of such an investment
plan and is fully aware that India is a populous country with a
fast-growing economy and vast market, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>However, he added, as a state-run enterprise with limited
financial capabilities, the CPC must consider the government's
position and how the CPC's future might be affected when assessing
the investment plan.</P>
      <P>The spokesman stressed that it was premature to speculate whether
the CPC's plan would materialize.</P>

      <P>The first shipment of U.S. beef since Taiwan
resumed trade in U.S. boneless beef from animals under 30 months of
age is scheduled to arrive at Chiang Kai-shek (CKS) International
Airport Feb. 9, industry sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Hou Sheng-mou may go to the
CKS Airport cargo terminal Friday to inspect the newly imported
products, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Many local gourmets love U.S. beef. But after the discovery of a
single case of mad cow disease in Washington State in December 2003,
Taiwan, like many other Asian countries, immediately banned imports
of U.S. beef and related produce.</P>
      <P>The ban was lifted in April 2005, but was imposed again three
months later due to the discovery of a second case of mad cow
disease.</P>
      <P>Following the lead of some other Asian countries, the DOH quietly
lifted the ban again Jan. 25. The move has drawn strong criticism as
it came after Japan halted U.S. beef imports again in mid-December in
the wake of the discovery of banned spinal bones in a shipment of
American veal.</P>
      <P>With the first shipment of U.S. beef since market re-opening
scheduled to arrive soon, local restaurateurs are carefully evaluating
the best timing for re-introducing U.S. beef dishes in their menus,

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT'S UNIFICATION COUNCIL STATEMENT NOT IMPROVISED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  6 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian was not making
offhand remarks when he said on lunar New Year's Day that he was
seriously considering dissolving the National Unification Council and
its guidelines, a senior official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Tan Sun Chen, secretary-general of the Presidential Office, said
he heard the president speak of the idea twice before it was made
public -- once when he was foreign minister and then when Chen
Shui-bian asked him to be his chief aide at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Tan Sun Chen made the remarks during a regular meeting of
government and ruling party officials at the Presidential Office,
according to participants.</P>
      <P>They reached a consensus on "speaking in one voice" about the
president's statement, which has caused some controversy at home and
in the United States, whose officials were reportedly displeased over
it.</P>
      <P>The participants said they felt that Chen's proposal was "not as
serious as the U.S. imagined, " and that Taiwan should do its best to
"communicate with the U.S." to solicit its full understanding of the
matter.</P>
      <P>Most of the participants agreed that the president's proposal to
abolish the National Unification Council (NUC) and Guidelines would
not come as a surprise to members of the governing Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian made the gesture at this time mainly in order to
stop what he perceived as Taiwan's ongoing tilt toward China, the
participants said, adding that most DPP members would agree with
Chen's proposal.</P>
      <P>"Even if it was not aimed at moving toward Taiwan's independence,
at least it was aimed at slowing the pace of tilting toward
unification with China," said the participants.</P>
      <P>Some National Security Council delegates to the meeting pointed
out that the NUC and its guidelines were set up when the Kuomintang
was in power, a move that amounted to predetermining a stance on
developing relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, we should explain to people the background of the
NUC's establishment," the NSC delegates were quoted.</P>
      <P>The DPP has already decided to hold a "grand debate" on the topic
next month. Some participants in Monday's meeting suggested the
debate be expanded so that voices from all sectors of society could
be heard, and that the event may help forge a national consensus on
the issue.</P>
      <P>A participant told CNA that the president does not have a
concrete timetable for abolishing the NUC and its guidelines, and
suggested that chances were good of winning U.S. understanding
because the impact of Chen's words wasn't as severe as when former
president Lee Teng-hui described Taiwan and China as having "special
state-to-state" relations.</P>
      <P>The meeting's participants included Minister Without Portfolio
Lin Hsi-yao, Government Information Office chief Cheng Wen-tsan, DPP
Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung, DPP Culture and Information Director
Tsai Huang-liang and leaders of the DPP's legislative caucus.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA TO SPOTLIGHT CHILDREN'S LITERATURE AT TIBE BOOKFAIR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia will feature children's literature
-- a proud tradition of the Australian publishing business -- at the
Taipei International Book Exhibition (TIBE), a top representative of
the Australian Commerce and Industry Office (ACIO) said at a press
conference Monday.</P>
      <P>Known for winning global success in its children's literature,
Australia hopes to win a place in the hearts of Taiwanese children
and adults alike through the display of its picture books and
illustrations at the TIBE, which will be held in the Taipei World
Trade Center from Feb. 7-12, ACIO top representative Steve Waters
said.</P>
      <P>Australia and Vietnam will be the only first-timers among the 41
countries that are participating in the annual event, the largest
bookfair in Asia.</P>
      <P>Among the 22 participating writers and illustrators are Alison
Lester, who has been writing and illustrating children's books for 25
years, and Ron Brooks, a three-time winner of the Children's Book
Council of Australia's Picture Book of the Year award.</P>
      <P>"Australia has a strong educational link to Taiwan," said Waters,
adding that a third of overseas Taiwanese students study in
Australia. It's part of the reason why Taiwan will be a special
market for Australia's publishers, he noted.</P>
      <P>Australia is a land of contrast -- bustling cities, cultivated
farmland, desert, snowy mountains and beautiful beaches, Waters said.
Its children's literature reflects the contrasts and multicultural
background of Australia, where illustrators and writers get their
inspiration and creativity. And Australia hopes to share all of that
with Taiwanese readers.</P>
      <P>This will be the second stop for Australian publishers in Asia
since they attended the 2005 Expo in Aichi, Japan last year.</P>

(By Taijing Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although Taiwan is at the cutting edge of
the Chinese-speaking world in terms of culture and design, its
publishing industry still leaves much room for improvement, the head
of the Government Information Office (GIO) said Monday.</P>
      <P>GIO Minister Cheng Wen-tsang made the statement at a news
conference introducing the 14th Taipei International Book Exhibition
(TIBE) , to be held at the Taipei World Trade Center from Feb. 7 to
Feb. 12.</P>
      <P>"The TIBE is Taiwan's bridge to the international book market.
Although the Chinese invented printing, the Europeans are the ones who
have excelled in its applications," Minister Cheng said.</P>
      <P>"I hope that Taiwan's publishers can take advantage of the TIBE
to access the international book market. This is the path that
Taiwan's printing industry has to take, and there's a lot of room for
improvement," Cheng added.</P>
      <P>"In the past, the TIBE has extensively promoted Taiwanese
publications in the international arena. Books are not only a means
of carrying knowledge, they also reflect a form of culture. In a
book, you can find tradition, fine arts and crafts," Cheng said.</P>
      <P>In order to attract sleepless book lovers, this year organizers
have extended opening hours until 10 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday, the
last two days of the exhibition.</P>
      <P>The TIBE is the largest bookfair in Asia. Publications from 41
countries will be represented at 1,910 stalls set up within three
halls.</P>
      <P>The guests of honor's pavilion this year will feature
publications from France, Germany, Greece and Poland. The TIBE is
expected to attract more than 400,000 visitors.</P>
      <P>Australia and Vietnam are taking part in the exhibition this year
for the first time.</P>

possess what they really do not possess; pretend to have plenty, when
they have really nothing; and pretend to be in affluence when they
are in actual want -- in such a state of society, it is difficult to
be even a scrupulous man."</TEXT>

      <P>Cheng, who concurrently serves as Government Information Office

    <TEXT>
      <P>It is up to the people, rather than the
government or anyone else, to decide whether Taiwan should unify with
China, President Chen Shui-bian's deputy chief of staff said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General Cho Jung-tai made
the comments while attending the swearing in ceremony for the new
legislative whip of the Taiwan Solidarity Union at the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>The National Unification Guidelines -- originally designed in the
early 1990s to facilitate ultimate unification across the Taiwan
Strait -- can set approaches and their orders but should not set the
goals, Cho said.</P>
      <P>The goals of the nation should be left open so that the people of
Taiwan can decide on whether Taiwan should seek unification with
China, Cho stressed.</P>
      <P>Immediate unification is not an option as far as the National
Unification Guidelines are concerned and as many members of the
Taiwan public are opposed to the idea, Cho said, adding that the
ultimate goals of the nation are up to the people alone to decide.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO ISSUE FIRST IP PHONE LICENSE BY JUNE AT EARLIEST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,    Jan.    7   (CNA)
(By Joy Wan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Directorate General of
Telecommunications (DGT) under the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications is expected to issue its first license for IP phone
operators sometime in June after completing an evaluation on Internet
communications surveillance, a local daily reported Monday.</P>
      <P>The Chinese-language Economic Daily News reported that the
government announced last November that fixed-network operators with
a minimum of NT$500 million in capital are eligible to apply for a
license to provide IP phone services.</P>
      <P>Operators that pass the government's evaluation will be given a
batch of 11-digit phone numbers starting with "070" for them to sell
to IP phone users.</P>
      <P>Although the measure came into effect three months ago,
investigative authorities, including those from the Investigation
Bureau under the Ministry of Justice and the Criminal investigation
Bureau under the Ministry of Interior, have not formulated related
packages that ensure Internet communications security, the DGT said.</P>
      <P>The lack of a sound package has hampered many operators' plans to
enter the IP phone market, which is seeing a rising numbers of
Taiwanese users turning to the Internet for phone conversations, the
report said.</P>
      <P>While Skype and Yahoo already offer phone services via the
Internet in Taiwan, no phone numbers are provided to the subscribers,
which limits the functions and services of IP phones.</P>
      <P>The daily cited the DGT as saying that the investigative
authorities have stepped up efforts in the formulation of security
and surveillance regulations and that the first license will be issue
in June at the earliest.</P>
      <P>Seednet, Skype, and Sonet are among the fixed-network operators
that are looking to expand their share of the IP phone market in

    <HEADLINE>NO PLANS TO SEND ENVOY TO U.S. OVER PRESIDENT CHEN'S REMARKS: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Huang Chih-fang
said Tuesday that there are no plans to send an envoy to the United
States to allay its concerns over President Chen Shui-bian's proposal
to scrap the National Unification Council (NUC) and the National
Unification Guidelines.</P>
      <P>The communication work will be conducted in Taipei and
Washington, respectively, Huang said.</P>
      <P>"If President Chen's remarks came as a surprise to the United
States, Taiwan will heed its response and continue communications, "
Huang said.</P>
      <P>After President Chen said on Lunar New Year's Day that Taiwan
should seriously consider scrapping the NUC, the United States
expressed concern, urging President Chen to honor his "five noes"
pledges, which include no declaration of independence and no
abolishing of the NUC as long as Beijing has no intention to use
force against Taiwan, during his inaugural speech in 2000 and again
in 2004.</P>
      <P>Tan Sun Chen, secretary-general of the Presidential Office, said
in a major meeting Monday that the proposal to scrap the NUC is not
an improvised one, noting that he heard the president speak of the
idea twice before it was made public. The media also cited officials
from the Presidential Office as saying that the abolishing of the NUC
can be regarded as a near-term goal of President Chen in dealing with
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Huang would not comment on the scrapping of the NUC, saying that
his ministry will be in charge of communication with other countries 
in whatever policy the government has adopted.</P>
      <P>The NUC, set up more than a decade ago by the former Kuomintang
administration, advocates the eventual unification of Taiwan and
China. Therefore, China has viewed the proposal to scrap the NUC as a
move toward de jure Taiwan independence, which Beijing has threatened
to stop by force.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An anti-graft group on Tuesday called for
more government officials to be required to place their assets into
blind trust.</P>
      <P>The Anti Corruption Action Alliance, which is comprised of
several reform-minded civil groups, said the public functionary
assets disclosure system is currently not comprehensive enough.</P>
      <P>Chien Hsi-chieh, a former legislator and convener of the Alliance
of Fairness and Justice, noted that the Executive Yuan is expected to
pass a package of regulations to implement the system to place the
assets of senior government officials into blind trust in a meeting
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations, 130 political appointees in the
administrative team and their families are required to put their
assets, including investment-purpose properties and securities, into
blind trust.</P>
      <P>Chieh said that he was gratified to learn that the government has
responded positively to the alliance's longstanding calls. However,
he pointed out that the regulations will apply only to 130 political
appointees and their families and will not include all ranking
officials in the central and local government offices.</P>
      <P>Those public officials who are in charge of crucial businesses
should also be included, he said.</P>
      <P>Chieh noted that in Hong Kong and Singapore, public functionaries
can be charged with corruption if they cannot clearly explain the
source of their increased wealth. Although the rules might be a
little too strict, Taiwan could learn from the examples of Hong Kong
and Singapore by at least meting out sufficient administrative 
punishment and confiscating the assets of those officials who break
the rules, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN EXPERTS ATTEND INT'L MEETING ON TOBACCO CONTROL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva, Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu &amp; Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan experts and scholars in public health
and representatives of anti-tobacco organizations attended the first
session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the World Health
Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) which
opened here Monday and will run through Feb. 17.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese participants include Yao Szu-yuan, dean of the College
of Law at Chinese Culture University; Chan Chang-chuan, professor in
public health at National Taiwan University; and Lee Meng-chih of the
Taiwan medical sector's anti-tobacco league; as well as Department of
Health (DOH) officials and representatives of the non-profit John
Tung Foundation advocating tobacco control in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The FCTC has been signed by 168 countries, while 122 have
ratified the treaty, which entered into force Feb. 27, 2005. Being
the world's first public health treaty, the FCTC contains a host of
measures designed to reduce the devastating health and economic
impacts of tobacco.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Legislative Yuan ratified the treaty Jan. 14 last year,
but it has failed to pass an amendment to the exiting Tobacco Hazard
Control Act to allow the implementation of many planned stricter
anti-tobacco measures that were drawn in line with the FCTC
regulations.</P>
      <P>DOH official Chang Wu-hsiu in charge of international cooperation
affairs said there is still much work for Taiwan to do to improve its
tobacco control measures. "That's why we're attending this
conference," he added.</P>
      <P>Echoing Chang's remarks, Lee indicated that Taiwan's anti-tobacco
hazard measures need to be reinforced. Although Taiwan recently
raised its tobacco tax by 50 percent, the price of a pack of
cigarettes in Taiwan is still far lower than in most Western
countries. Lee suggested that the average price of a pack of
cigarettes be raised to NT$200 (US$6.20) from the current level of
around NT$50.</P>
      <P>The COP, serving as the management body for the FCTC, is charged
with guiding, supervising and reviewing works to carry out the treaty
which was established to lower the level of global tobacco
consumption and to reduce the number of deaths related to tobacco
use.</P>
      <P>In the 12-day session of the COP, parties will make decisions on
technical, procedural and financial matters relating to the treaty's
implementation, such as the establishment of a permanent secretariat
and funding and financial support and monitoring and reporting on
implementation progress.</P>

around the world.</P>
      <P>Citing the pavilion featuring the culture of reading in France,
Germany, Greece and Poland as an example, Su said the special theme
pavilion is presenting different European cultures to Taiwan readers

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO STRENGTHEN INVESTMENT IN AGRICULTURAL SECTOR: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 7 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that
the government will strengthen investment in the agricultural sector
and accelerate the adjustment of its structure amid the growing
competition caused by globalization.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during an award presentation ceremony
organized by the Council of Agriculture for outstanding farmers.</P>
      <P>Facing strong competition arising from trade liberalization and
globalization, the government has been promoting agricultural reforms
during the last few years by strengthening the structure of the
agricultural sector and the marketing of agricultural products in the
world market, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Among the various reform projects, ensuring the safety of
agricultural products is a top priority of the government, Chen said,
adding that the government will help farmers to produce safe and
high-quality products to create a win-win situation for both the
consumers and the producers.</P>
      <P>In addition, the farmers have seen an improvement in agricultural
sector finances, with the ratio of overdue loans in agricultural
financial institutions decreasing to 11.42 percent as of last
November and the deposits of farmers and fishermen reaching NT$94.8
billion (US$2.96 billion) as of the end of 2005, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has been a World Trade Organization (WTO)
member for four years, Chen said the impact of Taiwan's WTO entry on
the domestic agricultural sector has not been as serious as
originally expected.</P>
      <P>Chen said the agreement reached in the latest trade ministers'
meeting under the framework of the WTO in December is not expected to
have any major new impact on Taiwan's agricultural sector in the
short run, adding however that the new round of agricultural
negotiations will continue.</P>
      <P>The agreements that will be reached in the negotiations on the
liberalization of agricultural trade will inevitably pose a challenge
to Taiwan's agricultural sector, Chen said.</P>
      <P>"The government will increase investment in the sector,
accelerate its structural adjustment, as well as strengthen the
international marketing of farm products to help farmers maintain
their competitiveness," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Chen urged the agricultural sector to transform from "a closed
and protected industry into an open and competitive one" by having
faith in itself and the government and by being in tune with the
government's policies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FREQUENT BLOOD DONOR AWARDED AS HONORED CITIZEN OF TAINAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  7 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A frequent blood donor in Tainan City was
awarded with the title of "honored citizen" of the southern city on
Tuesday after he donated blood for the 1,001st time in his life.</P>
      <P>Chang Kuo-sen, 51, is the first blood donor in Taiwan who has
made more than 1,000 blood donations. Chang's three brothers are also
frequent blood donors who have made over 100 donations, while his
three children also donate blood regularly.</P>
      <P>Chang's first encounter with blood donation dates back to 30
years ago when he worked as a taxi driver.</P>
      <P>One day, Chang gave a ride to two woman students who were heading
to the city's blood donation station to donate blood. He followed the
pair to the station out of curiosity, but when workers at the station
asked him if he also wanted to donate blood, he became so frightened
that he fled the scene immediately.</P>
      <P>Chang felt terribly embarrassed by his own behavior that day, so
he went back to the station the next day to donate 250 cc of blood
for the first time in his life. In 1985, he became the country's
first blood donor to have made more than 100 blood donations.</P>
      <P>During the last 30 years, the most unforgettable moment for Chang
was when his wife was giving birth to their first child and met a
difficult situation that called for a Caesarean section and blood
transfusion. The blood donation center of Kaohsiung sent four
1,000-cc bags of blood to Tainan within one-and-a-half hours. The
experience strengthened Chang's belief in the importance of donating
blood to help others.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ONLY 53% OF CERTIFIED TEACHERS EMPLOYED IN SCHOOLS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 7 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) has issued
over 108,000 teacher certificates since 1997, but only 53.4 percent
of certificate holders have found employment in schools, according to
teacher education statistics released by the MOE Tuesday.</P>
      <P>From 1997 until the present, figures showed that 6,102 of 8,246
teachers certified in special education were hired as full-time
teachers by schools, registering the group with the highest rate of
employment. In contrast, certified kindergarten teachers were far
less in demand, with only 990 of the 7,110 certificate holders
employed by kindergartens.</P>
      <P>The report predicted that teacher employment would remain at low
levels as long as the policies surrounding teacher education stay the
same. No increase in employment statistics is expected in the next
five years, MOE officials said.</P>
      <P>The teacher education law was amended in 1994 to enable more
institutions to train and certify teachers. Before then, the
education of teachers and other educational professionals was
confined to teacher training colleges and normal universities. The
amended law opened the door for other educational institutions to
provide teacher training programs.</P>
      <P>Under the revised policy, the number of people with teaching

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou on Tuesday advised all Taipei mayoral aspirants to "take
things in stride" and campaign fairly in the KMT primary for the
year-end mayoral election.</P>
      <P>Ma, who doubles as Taipei mayor, made the remarks against the
background of a large number of KMT members who have been expressing
interest in running for the post, including former Environmental
Protection Administration head Hau Lung-bin, Legislators Tsai
Cheng-yuan and John Chiang, as well as Taipei Deputy Mayor Yeh
Chin-chuan.</P>
      <P>Yeh will act on Ma's behalf after Ma departs for Europe later
Tuesday for a 13-day tour which will take him to Italy, Switzerland,
Britain, Ireland, and Belgium to solicit business opportunities for
Taipei city.</P>
      <P>Ma reaffirmed that he has full confidence in Yeh's administrative
ability. </P>
      <P>Though Ma has refrained from publicly endorsing any aspirant
prior to the party's primary in May, he said earlier that experience
in the post of vice mayor would greatly facilitate the work for
pushing for the city's development.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsai earlier questioned Yeh's participation in feasts
given by chiefs of the boroughs, the smallest administrative units,
saying that this had violated administrative neutrality.</P>
      <P>Yeh said he was invited to the feasts, but hadn't sponsored them.
If the public had any misgiving about his integrity, Yeh added, they
should file a report with the ethics department of Taipei City
Government, and not arbitrarily accuse him.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRAFFIC JAM FORECAST AS ETC SERVICE LAUNCHES ON EXPRESSWAYS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  7 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the electronic toll collection (ETC)
system set to go into effect Feb. 10, the Consumers Foundation
criticized the government Tuesday for not having designed a mechanism
that would benefit all users of the road.</P>
      <P>It also forecast that the nation's two major south-north tollways
would become even more congested when the ETC system is officially
launched.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an Internet campaign is advising drivers not to submit
to the unreasonable pricing system offered by the FETC, a subsidiary
of the Far Eastern Group that was authorized to operate the ETC
system.</P>
      <P>The Foundation said the No. 1 and No. 3 expressways are used by
an average 1.53 million vehicles per day, but so far only 20,000
vehicles have installed FETC's on-board units (OBUs) . Therefore, it
said it could safely predict that when special lanes have been set
aside for ETC users at the toll stations, traffic on the road will
come to a standstill.</P>
      <P>Using the No. 1 expressway as an example, Foundation experts said
that eight of its 11 toll stations only have 10 lanes for two-way
traffic, meaning only five lanes for each direction. ETC will take
two lanes -- one for small cars and the other for passenger buses or
cargo trucks, leaving only three lanes for other users. These three
lanes must be divided into special lanes for four types of vehicles
(small passenger cars, large passenger buses, cargo trucks and
container trucks) , and then divided into one for toll ticket users
and the other one for cash toll payers.</P>
      <P>"It isn't difficult to imagine what a nightmare Feb. 10 will be
on the No. 1 highway. The same thing will be happening on No. 3, "
they claimed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Area National Expressway Bureau Director General Chen
Chien-yu said ETC will only be used on two lanes each way and there
are still "plenty of lanes" for ticket- and cash-paying cars.</P>
      <P>"Nobody is forcing drivers to use the ETC service if they think
it is too expensive," he said.</P>
      <P>"Expensive" is precisely the most frequent complaint cited by
consumers. The Foundation lashed out at Chen's stance as the leader
of a government agency, whom the foundation finds is treating the
impending traffic jams as if it were not its business at all.</P>
      <P>The "Boycott FETC's ETC" campaign launched over the Internet
argued that it was unreasonable for the company to charge prospective
OBU users -- NT$680 per unit if they were the first 200,000 to
install the unit on their cars, whereas the regular price is almost
NT$1,200.</P>
      <P>In New York and its vicinity, a similar OBU is available free of
charge from the toll administrator -- with a deposit. When the unit
is returned, the deposit money is credited back to the user's
account.</P>
      <P>The campaign pointed out that FETC is doling out its
"preferential" OBU price in a bid to allure enough users so it can
avoid being punished by the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) . If no more than four percent of road users --
or 60,000 cars -- daily use the ETC within three months of its
launch, according to MOTC's contract with FETC, one ETC lane will be
withdrawn from each toll station. And if the user ratio fails to
reach 16.3 percent within one year, FETC will be fined NT$500,000 per
day.</P>
      <P>Other unreasonable charges by the FETC include a deposit of
NT$200 for buying a "stored value" card and a handling fee of NT$50
to return the card.</P>
      <P>"Even more unreasonable is a NT$7 handling fee that will be
charged every time the OBU user wants to add value to his card," said
an email message circulated on the Net.</P>
      <P>The Consumers Foundation said that since the ETC was meant to
improve services for the public and FETC is contracted to provide
that service, the OBUs and accessories should be provided free of
charge -- and repaired at no extra charge if an OBU breaks down.</P>
      <P>The Foundation also advised consumers to "think clearly" before
deciding to install an OBU in their cars, such as whether a mere five
percent discount on tolls was reasonable, and whether driving past an
ETC lane at a speed of 30-40 km/h would help you arrive at your
destination any faster.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan air carriers made an average 13.6
flight safety violations each year during the period from June 1998
to December 2005, according to recent government statistics.</P>
      <P>Taiwan carriers registered a total of 109 flight safety
violations during the eight-year period, with fines on aviation
companies, pilots and maintenance mechanics totalling over NT$14
million, figures made public by the Aviation Safety Council under the
Executive Yuan indicated.</P>
      <P>Under pressure from the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) to
improve their safety track record, aviation companies have committed
fewer errors since 2002 after the administration implemented new
regulations a year earlier with the objective of reducing the
possibility of human error.</P>
      <P>Apart from climate factors, the CAA said, the most common human
mistakes resulted from faulty repairs and maintenance, overloading of

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 7 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Independent Legislator Li Ao vowed Tuesday
that he will continue to oppose the passage of any bill that would
allow the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government to buy
weapons from the United States.</P>
      <P>Li, a noted writer and historian, reiterated his strong
opposition to the government's military procurement plan while
reporting to the Legislative Yuan ahead of the new legislative
session.</P>
      <P>The opposition-controlled legislature has blocked two bills
submitted by the DPP government in the past two years -- bills that
sought approval for a special budget of NT$480 billion (US$14.9
billion) to purchase eight diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot
PAC III anti-missile batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C
anti-submarine aircraft from the United States.</P>
      <P>Li warned Ma Ying-jeou, chairman of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT), not to reach any compromise with the DPP government
that would allow the military procurement bill to pass. Otherwise, he
cautioned, Ma would be "betraying Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The KMT chairman is reportedly planning to present the KMT's
version of the arms package during the new legislative session.</P>
      <P>Li explained that Taiwan is not required to pay for weapons
supplied by the United States under the Taiwan Relations Act, which
stipulates: "It is the policy of the United States to provide Taiwan
with arms of a defensive character."</P>
      <P>Insisting that the word "provide" means that weapons supplied by
the United States to Taiwan should be free, Li said that Taiwan not
only doesn't need to pay for weapons it wants this year, but that he
would file a lawsuit in the U.S. federal court against the U.S.
government, asking it to refund all the money Taiwan has paid for
U.S. weapons over the past 27 years.</P>
      <P>Asked about his priorities for the new legislative session, Li
said he would focus on international issues and pay less attention to
Taiwan's domestic affairs.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Drafting a new constitution for the country
will be a major objective of the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) this
year, a leading TSU legislator said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to David C. Huang, convener of the TSU's legislative
caucus, the TSU's version of the draft constitution will be presented
to the party's central executive committee for discussion on
Wednesday and then forwarded to a review panel for deliberation.</P>
      <P>Then the party will hold five public hearings on the draft, a
process which is expected to be completed in August, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Huang added the draft will not only cover changes to the
country's political system but also address issues concerning the
economy, national defense, domestic affairs and education.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, in light of the existing economic policy
that favors the hi-tech industry and neglects the agricultural
sector, the TSU version of the draft would include a policy aimed at
protecting farmers and fisheries while encouraging traditional
industries to upgrade.</P>
      <P>He said the TSU will also propose the enactment of a basic law
that would help farmers develop more sophisticated agriculture and
help the fishing industry improve its open-seas operations.</P>
      <P>Regarding measures to improve the country's law and order, the
TSU version of the draft will stipulate that the government should
hold law and order conferences on a regular basis, he said.</P>
      <P>On education, the draft will advocate the provision of
"Taiwanized" education in school and the extension of
government-funded education from nine years to 12 years, he added.</P>
      <P>According to a plan unveiled by President Chen Shui-bian, a draft
constitution should be completed this year and put forth for a
referendum in 2007.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian expressed hope
Tuesday that agricultural award winners will act as navigators in the
agricultural sector and make more contributions to the industry.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during an award presentation ceremony
organized by the Council of Agriculture for outstanding figures
dedicated to farming and agricultural research.</P>
      <P>The winners of this year's awards are a mung bean research team
from the Asian Vegetable Research and Development Center (AVRDC), the
Taiwan Animal Cloning and Transgenic Research Team and Honorary
Professor Dr. Hong-ji Su of National Taiwan University.</P>
      <P>Among the different categories, the mung bean team was awarded
for ensuring food safety, while the cloning group was awarded for its
innovative technology.</P>
      <P>No individuals or groups were awarded in the categories of
extraordinary services and ecosystem conservation.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the AVRDC mung bean research team is the most
prestigious team of its kind in the world. During the last 30 years,
the team has cultivated 66 types of mung beans, with more than 1.2
million hectares of land around 22 countries dedicated to the
cultivation of mung beans developed by the group, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>The group's research has significantly improved food supplies and

      <P>A former head of the Environmental
Protection Administration said Tuesday that if he is elected Taipei
mayor in the year-end election, he will set a goal of reducing carbon
dioxide emissions by cars in the city by 10 percent each year.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a discussion session on green energy held by Delta
Electronics Inc., Hau Lung-bin said that meeting the target would
mean that in four years, carbon dioxide emission from cars in Taipei
would drop by 40 percent, making the air in the city considerably
cleaner.</P>
      <P>He explained that one way to help achieve the goal would be to
require the 60,000 taxi drivers registered with the city to switch to
hybrid cars when they retire their old cars. The hybrid cars, powered
by a combination of gasoline and rechargeable batteries, discharge
much less carbon dioxide than conventional cars.</P>
      <P>He also said that if he is elected mayor, he will require
government agencies to cut their electricity and fuel consumption by
at least 1 percent each year. The money saved will be spent on the
city's reconstruction projects, he said.</P>
      <P>Hau used to be a member of the tiny opposition New Party -- a
partner of the opposition Kuomintang in the "pan-blue alliance." He
joined the KMT with the New Party's blessing Jan. 12, the day he
announced his mayoral bid.</P>
      <P>Although he is favored in opinion polls as having more chance of
winning than other candidates, he will still have to compete with

    <TEXT>
      <P>An official of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) said Tuesday that official exchanges between
Taiwan and Hong Kong have not improved since Donald Tsang assumed the
post of Hong Kong chief executive in June 2005.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chih-chung, director of the MAC's Department of Hong Kong
and Macau Affairs, made the remarks in a briefing on the Hong Kong
and Macau situation.</P>
      <P>He noted that non-political exchanges with Hong Kong and Macau
were close last year, with significant growth registered both in
personnel as well as in trade and economic exchanges.</P>
      <P>But despite this, Tsai pointed out that the Hong Kong government
has been conservative in its official exchanges with Taiwan, turning
down Taiwan officials' applications for Hong Kong visas from time to
time and refusing to say why.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that official exchanges between Taiwan and Hong Kong
should not be conducted only through indirect "communication via
appropriate channels."</P>
      <P>He said Hong Kong should set up an office in Taiwan to handle
matters concerning Hong Kong visitors in Taiwan, which he claimed
is the "only way" that would be beneficial to both sides.</P>
      <P>Tsai noted that in 2005, the number of Hong Kong residents coming
to Taiwan topped 335,000, up 6.2 percent from the previous year,
compared with more than 2.73 million people from Taiwan who visited
Hong Kong in 2005, up 17.4 percent from the previous year.</P>
      <P>More than 18,000 Macau residents came to Taiwan in 2005, up 1.5
percent from the previous year, compared with 1.16 million Taiwan
residents who visited Macau, up 16.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Two-way trade between Taiwan and Hong Kong totaled NT$32.6
billion (US$1.018 billion) in 2005, up 2 percent from the previous
year, while two-way trade between Taiwan and Macau totaled more than
NT$300 million in 2005, up 1.7 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REGULAR BUDGET CAN PAY FOR WEAPONS IF DEFENSE SPENDING RAISED: MND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  7 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Expenses for buying three major weaponry
items from the United States can be covered in the Ministry of
Defense (MND) regular budget if defense spending is raised to 3
percent of the gross national product (GDP) , as the government has
tried to do, an MND official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A special budget bill to buy eight conventional submarines, 12
P-3C submarine-hunting aircraft and six Patriot III anti-missile
batteries at a cost of NT$480 billion, with NT$140 billion listed in
regular budget for purchasing three anti-missile batteries, has been
continually blocked in the Legislative Yuan by the opposition, which
holds a slim legislative majority.</P>
      <P>Hu Chen-pu, chief of the ministry's General Political Warfare
Bureau, said the MND plans to hold a seminar Feb. 27 at the Joint
Military Exercise Center in an attempt to convince lawmakers and
other participants of the "actual need" to acquire the weapons.</P>
      <P>Hu claimed that various war simulations have led to the
conclusion that it is important to beef up Taiwan's anti-missile and
anti-submarine capabilities and to increase its submarine fleet.</P>
      <P>According to an MND analysis, China will likely increase its
ballistic missiles targeting Taiwan to 1,800 by 2010, while its
current 32 conventional and nuclear submarine force will grow to 44
in 2008 and to 50 in 2015.</P>
      <P>If the government's budget bill to procure the three weapons
systems continues to fail to clear the legislative floor, the
military balance will tilt toward China "beginning this year, "
according to the analysis.</P>
      <P>The MND continued that the number of China's new warships, which
stood at 24 in 2005, will have risen to 38 by 2015, when China will
also launch an aircraft carrier battle group that will likely menace
Taiwan's airspace.</P>
      <P>It said Taiwan is badly in need of nine Patriot III anti-missile
batteries, 12 anti-submarine aircraft and 10 submarines, which will
force China to spend hugely on beefing up its anti-submarine
capability as well as other defenses.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, a MND computer simulation shows that if China
fires six to eight missiles at Taiwan simultaneously from different
locations, the chances of the missiles destroying Taiwan's airports
would be just 0.2 percent if Taiwan were equipped with three Patriot
III batteries, but the chances would rise to 5 percent with the
current Patriot II anti-missiles.</P>
      <P>Over the long term, the military balance will develop across the
Taiwan Strait in favor of China, according to MND's estimates, which
indicate that between 2020 and 2035, China's military might will be
2.8 times greater than that of Taiwan's.</P>
      <P>However, the MND claimed that if the three key weapons can be
purchased, the difference will shrink to 1.67 times.</P>

      <P>About 20 people led by Taiwan South Society President Tseng
Kuei-hai, presented an open letter and a statement to U.S. President
George W. Bush via the AIT's Kaohsiung office in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The letter voiced support for the U.S. "one China policy " and
defined the policy as "an emphasis on peaceful solution acceptable to
both sides of the Taiwan Strait rather than on 'final
reunification.'"</P>
      <P>The groups also expressed their aspirations for Taiwan statehood
and said that hopefully their aspiration will be "worked out to
become a framework which is compatible with the American 'one China
policy.'"</P>
      <P>But in the additional statement presented by the groups, the
groups showed worries over the possibility that "peaceful resolution"
may become China's eventual "peaceful liberalization" of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Bush Senior thought about implementing 'one country, two
systems' in Taiwan; former U.S. Secretary of the State Colin Powell
also said in public that Taiwan `does not enjoy sovereignty as a
nation'; a series of policies of the White House and the U.S.
Department of State show that the United States is doing things in a
way that will allow China to annex Taiwan gradually, " the statement
claimed.</P>
      <P>"The erosion of Taiwan's sovereignty poses a threat to the
Taiwanese people's pursuit of universal values and we cannot accept
that," it added.</P>
      <P>The statement also voiced dissatisfaction over the U.S.
disagreement with Taiwan in recent cross-Taiwan Strait affairs and
urged Bush to support President Chen Shui-bian's intention to
abolish the National Unification Council and the National Unification
Guidelines.</P>
      <P>AIT spokeswoman Dana Shell Smith said the office would pass the
message on.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INTERESTS OF NON-ETC USERS WILL NOT BE AFFECTED ON FREEWAYS: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>At least seven lanes in each direction will
be available at the toll stations on the nation's two major
south-north freeways, which means that when an electronic toll
collection (ETC) service is launched Feb. 10, the interests of
non-ETC users will not be affected, a senior official claimed
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-yu, director of the Taiwan Area National Expressway
Bureau (TANEB), was responding to Consumer Foundation criticism that
the bureau is asking only 4 percent of drivers to use the ETC service
during the initial period, so that the other 96 percent of drivers
will be forced into only three lanes at most toll stations.</P>
      <P>The foundation forecast major freeway congestion when the ETC
service is launched, claiming that the TANEB has failed to design a
mechanism that will benefit all road users.</P>
      <P>However, Chen said the foundation was citing false information,
pointing out that even the smallest toll station will still have
seven lanes each way, leaving five lanes for ticket- and cash-paying
drivers, not three, with ETC users confined to the other two lanes.</P>
      <P>As for the foundation's prediction that ETC will not speed up
traffic flow, Chen claimed that ETC lanes will increase traffic flow
from the present 900 cars per hour to 1,600 cars per hour.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GERMAN, FRENCH INDEPENDENT PUBLISHERS SURVIVE WITH GOVERNMENT HELP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  7 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>German and French independent publishers
suffer minimal impact from globalization and modern chainstores and
survive thanks to help from government law and subsidies, independent
publishers from Germany and France said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>French independent publishers are doing well despite the impact
of globalization and the invasion of mega publishers and chainstores,
said Paul Otchakovsky-Laurens of POL-Gallimard, a French independent
publisher, in a European Forum titled "The Development and Transition
of the Publishing Industry in France and Germany" at the Taipei
International Book Exhibition (TIBE).</P>
      <P>TIBE is taking place from Feb. 7-12 at the Taipei World Trade
Center with publishers from 41 countries participating.</P>
      <P>A big part of the success is attributed to legal protection by
the French government that sets fixed book prices and prohibits
publishers from advertising, Otchakovsky-Laurens said.
Publishers who publish poems, drama, literature and translated work
are also subsidized by the government.</P>
      <P>Rene Strien of German independent publisher Aufbau-Verlag voiced
a similar opinion. "We have the special situation of a legally
protected, fixed book price. Theoretically, that device should allow
any bookstore, small and economically weak as it may be, to compete
on equal terms with a megastore, " Strien said.</P>
      <P>Government subsidies play a big role in helping independent
publishers, Otchakovsky-Laurens said. With the subsidies, smaller
publishers can focus more on literature, poetry and translated works,
subjects that are not so popular with megapublishers, without
sacrificing too much financially, he said.</P>
      <P>With 25 member countries, the European Union faces language
barriers, said Jean-Guy Boin, Director of Bureau International de
l'Edition Francaise (BIEF) . "And that makes translation publishing
even more important in cultural exchanges."</P>
      <P>Independent publishers make great contributions in the
translation category, he said. "Publishers who translate French into
foreign languages receive government subsidies, and vice versa."</P>
      <P>Publishing practices in France and Germany can be a great example
for Taiwan, whose independent publishers have also been weathering
the impact of megapublishers, said Linden Lin, publisher of Linking
Publishing Company and the moderator of the forum.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MEASURED 'FIRST STRIKE' DESIGNED TO PRESERVE PEACE: MND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States is supportive of Taiwan's
measured mechanism regarding its reaction in the event of an attack
from China, a Ministry of National Defense (MND) official said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Gen. Hu Chen-pu, director of the MND Bureau of General Political
Warfare, was responding to a media report that the U.S. authorities
have questioned the rationale of Taiwan's response strategy in the
event of an attack by China that requires its defense minister to
give the "first strike" order instead of the frontline commander.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the strategy has made U.S. authorities
distrust Taiwan's determination to defend itself.</P>
      <P>Contrary to the report, Hu said, the U.S. authorities are
positive toward Taiwan's "you can't be too careful" principle in
designing its response strategy.</P>
      <P>"The main purpose of having the defense minister instead of the
frontline commander give the 'first strike' order in response to an
invasion from China is to avoid unwittingly sparking a cross-Taiwan
Strait war, " Hu said, adding that the defense minister would
definitely report the situation to the commander-in-chief of the
armed forces, namely the president, before giving the "first strike"
order in such a scenario.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the strict restrictions on the "first strike" are
aimed at averting war and ensuring lasting peace in the Taiwan
Strait, Hu said Taiwan's measured response strategy is a responsible
manner for dealing with a sensitive issue.</P>
      <P>"I'm convinced that the international community, including the
United States, is pleased to see Taiwan exercise prudence and
self-restraint in handling the issue," Hu said.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, Hu said, both sides of the Taiwan Strait
have been very cautious in handling even military training drills in
order to avoid triggering a cross-strait conflict inadvertently. For
instance, Taiwan has invariably unveiled its annual timetable for
major military exercises to prevent China from misjudging the
situation. Likewise, Hu said, Taiwan also knows in advance the timing
and content of China's major military drills.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>While Taiwan has difficulties making major
breakthroughs in its official diplomatic work, Taiwan's humanitarian
groups have found an alternative way to spread Taiwan's good deeds
and make friends.</P>
      <P>A surprise gift from Guatemala arrived Sunday for the Taiwan Fund
for Children and Families (CCF) . The gift is a beautiful hand-woven
linen Taiwan national flag -- a token of appreciation from a
Guatemalan family that has been helped by Taiwanese sponsors.</P>
      <P>The family is impoverished, with the father jobless and the
mother earning little from the sale of handicraft work. The two young
girls in the family are able to attend school only through the
sponsorship provided by donations from Taiwan sponsors.</P>
      <P>"On charity projects, we usually work with a whole community to
improve the community's standard of living, " CCF Executive Director
Chen Bang-hung said.</P>
      <P>The CCF is one of Taiwan's leading humanitarian groups. Its
overseas charity projects started in 1987 and it currently has
projects in 28 countries, helping over 28,400 children.</P>
      <P>"We use the donations mainly to improve children's health,
medical treatment and education. We also help with adult professional
training so that their parents can find jobs," Chen said.</P>
      <P>"Our overseas charity projects have helped allow more people to
know about Taiwan and it is a good way to conduct `civic diplomacy,'"
he added.</P>
      <P>World Vision Taiwan, another major humanitarian group, has a
similar story to tell. World Vision now has charity projects in 27
countries, helping over 80,000 children.</P>
      <P>One of the World Vision's projects that has helped improve
Taiwan's visibility in the international community is in Haiti, where
the organization has set up a charity community named "Taiwan
Village."</P>
      <P>But the most moving story comes from when Taiwanese sponsors
themselves became the ones in need.</P>
      <P>"During the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in Taiwan,
some of our sponsors received facemasks from the families they were

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Hwang Ing-san
ordered the Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) and Taiwan Power Company
(Taipower) Tuesday to present within one week plans to cut costs and
create new financial resources to cope with soaring international oil
prices.</P>
      <P>Hwang also instructed the two state-run companies to conduct a
comprehensive review of their existing mechanisms for hiking oil and
electricity rates.</P>
      <P>The minister issued the order during a briefing by managers of
state-run enterprises amid public concern that domestic oil prices
might be hiked after the Lunar New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>According to Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long,
the ministry has not set a timetable for hiking oil and electricity
rates.</P>
      <P>If the ministry decides to adjust oil and electricity rates, it
will make sure the public fully understands the rationale behind the
hikes, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Taipower had originally projected a deficit
for 2005 but it turned out that the company posted a surplus after it
adopted measures to reduce operational costs in the second half of
last year, which he said shows that cutting costs is a feasible
direction that the two companies can work towards.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, CPC President B.L. Chen said his company lost NT$3.2
billion (US$100 million) in January, when international oil prices
skyrocketed even higher, and he predicted that the loss will further
expand in February.</P>
      <P>Taipower President Chen Kuei-ming said his company lost NT$1.25
billion in January, adding that if international fuel prices continue
to soar it will bring heavy pressure to bear on the company.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Physical pain can be one of the outstanding
symptoms of patients suffering from depression and this pain can
worsen the patients'conditions and prevent them from quick recovery,
apsychiatrist said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>One high-achieving hi-tech company manager with a happy family
life began suffering from headaches and muscle pain six months ago.
At first, he thought he had a liver problem, but his doctor could
find nothing physically wrong and the patient became depressed to
point of considering suicide until he finally visited a psychiatrist,
who diagnosed his depression.</P>
      <P>"Depression is not a purely psychological problem but an illness
that is both psychological and physical, said " Hung Chin-yi, a
psychiatrist at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital.</P>
      <P>"The physical pain that often accompanies depression is often
mistaken as some other illness," he added.</P>
      <P>"If patients do not try to cure their physical pain, the chances
of them becoming afflicted with recurring bouts of depression are
greater," Hung warned.</P>
      <P>He said that according to his research among 151 patients,
depression patients with chronic migraine suffer from depression for
22.3 months on average, while patients without any kind of migraine
suffer for only 3.2 months on average. The research paper has been
published in the latest issue of Cephalalgia, a leading medical
journal on headache.</P>
      <P>In another research project among 121 patients, Hung found that
48 percent to 97 percent of the depression patients in the study also
suffered from physical problems such as insomnia, loss of energy,
dizziness and physical pain.</P>
      <P>Hung also said depression patients suffering from physical pain
do not recover as well as those without pain.</P>
      <P>"It is important that depression patients use both consultation
sessions and medication to achieve a cure," Hung said.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan is expected to approve a
new measure Wednesday requiring all Cabinet members and other
politically appointed senior officials, their spouses and dependent
children to put their assets, including securities, into blind trusts
within three months.</P>
      <P>Officials said Tuesday the new measure applies only to officials
of the Executive Yuan and affiliated agencies such as the Central
Bank of China (CBC) , the Central Election Commission (CEC) and
yet-to-be launched National Communications Commission (NCC). Those in
the other four branches of the central government and local
governments are not covered, nor are senior aides to ministers and
Presidential Office officials.</P>
      <P>The new measure will define who must put their assets into trust
and exactly which assets are affected. The Financial Supervisory
Commission (FSC) will recommend a list of trust companies and asset
management firms from which officials can choose. The officials will
have to bear all costs incurred.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office chief Cheng Wen-tsan said integrity
is a basic principle that must be followed by all members of the

place their assets in trust is only a first step toward that goal.</P>
      <P>He estimated that the measure will affect more than 130
officials, including ministers, top executives and their deputies, as

    <TEXT>
      <P>About 65 percent of the residents in
Kaohsiung, the second-largest city in Taiwan, have personally
experienced sexual harassment, according to results of an opinion
poll released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by the Social Affairs Bureau of the
Kaohsiung city government, interviewed 1,962 residents of Kaohsiung
during January, with 85 percent of the respondents male and the rest
female.</P>
      <P>The survey results show that 80 percent of the women respondents
claimed to have experienced sexual harassment in some form, while 35
percent of the men admitted to a similar experience.</P>
      <P>The forms of harassment covered by the survey included harassment
by language, gestures, exposure of sexual organs, showing
pornographic pictures to other people and staring at women's breasts
or other body parts.</P>
      <P>The statistics also show that 18 percent of the respondents
choose to ignore the harassment, while 20 percent said they tolerate
the experience without telling anyone. Another 21 percent said they
complain to a family member, a friend or a colleague.</P>
      <P>About 19 percent of the respondents said they tongue-lash the
perpetrator, while another 8 percent said they physically attack the
alleged perpetrator. Only 5 percent said they report the harassment
to the police or seek legal recourse.</P>
      <P>Social Affairs Bureau officials said the newly promulgated Sexual
Harassment Prevention Law will serve as a deterrent to sexual
harassment by providing the victims with a tool to seek justice.</P>
      <P>Under the new law, a victim of alleged sexual harassment can file
a complaint with the company for which the perpetrator works or with
the local government. The agency or the local government must then
investigate the complaint within a certain period of time and
offenders could face two years in prison, penal labor or a fine of up
to NT$100,000.</P>

      <P>The Taipei International Book Exhibition
(TIBE) now in its 14th year, is slowly moving from a purely business
event into a cultural activity, the head of the German Book
Information Center of Frankfurt Book Fair said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"In past years, TIBE was just an occasion where you could find
cheaper books in Taipei. It simply deprived bookstores of their usual
business and foreign publishers were also disappointed to see that
there was not much 'reading ambience' here, " Jing Bartz told CNA.</P>
      <P>"But TIBE this year shows a cultural aspect that encourages
people to read. It has turned from a business to a cultural activity,
" she added.</P>
      <P>The German Book Information Center in charge of the Frankfurt
Book Fair proposed to the European Union that four E.U. countries --
France, Germany, Greece and Poland -- group together in a pavilion
featuring their country's reading culture at the TIBE this year.</P>
      <P>Bartz suggested that future TIBEs could organize poetry or essay
reading sessions accompanied by music, which is common at book
fairs in Europe.</P>
      <P>Commenting on speculation that online publication might erode
traditional book sales, Bartz said: "Most people have this impression
because the Internet is accessible to everyone. But the funny thing
is that books turned down by publishers who feel they might not be
profitable often become famous once put online, so that its author
can then have it printed by a publishing company."</P>
      <P>"People definitely prefer to read conventional books to scrolling
down a screen. And the best gift a person can give is a book, " she
claimed.</P>
      <P>Bartz said that only reference books that take up too much space
on bookshelves and have very high printing costs, such as
Encyclopedia Britannica, are likely to be sold in an online form.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TIBE MOVES FROM BUSINESS TO CULTURE: ORGANIZER(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  7 (CNA)
(By Taijing Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei International Book Exhibition
(TIBE) now in its 14th year, is slowly moving from a purely business
event into a cultural activity, the head of the German Book
Information Center of Frankfurt Book Fair said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"In past years, TIBE was just an occasion where you could find
cheaper books in Taipei. It simply deprived bookstores of their usual
business and foreign publishers were also disappointed to see that
there was not much 'reading ambience' here, " Jing Bartz told CNA.</P>
      <P>"But TIBE this year shows a cultural aspect that encourages
people to read. It has turned from a business to a cultural activity,
" she added.</P>
      <P>The German Book Information Center in charge of the Frankfurt
Book Fair proposed to the European Union that four E.U. countries --
France, Germany, Greece and Poland -- group together in a pavilion
featuring their country's reading culture at the TIBE this year.</P>
      <P>Bartz suggested that future TIBEs could organize poetry or essay
reading sessions accompanied by music, which is common at book
fairs in Europe.</P>
      <P>Commenting on speculation that online publication might erode
traditional book sales, Bartz said: "Most people have this impression
because the Internet is accessible to everyone. But the funny thing
is that books turned down by publishers who feel they might not be
profitable often become famous once put online, so that its author
can then have it printed by a publishing company."</P>
      <P>"People definitely prefer to read conventional books to scrolling
down a screen. And the best gift a person can give is a book, " she
claimed.</P>
      <P>Bartz said that only reference books that take up too much space
on bookshelves and have very high printing costs, such as
Encyclopedia Britannica, are likely to be sold in an online form.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. REPEATS SUPPORT FOR PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF CROSS-STRAIT DISPUTES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   Feb.  7  (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. State Department officials
reiterated Tuesday Washington's support for apeaceful resolution of
cross-Taiwan Strait disputes in a way that is acceptable to people on
both sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>The officials were responding to remarks made by ROC President
Chen Shui-bian Tuesday that only the 23 million people of Taiwan have
the right to decide the fate of the country and that the sovereignty
of Taiwan belongs to the Taiwan people and cannot be shared with the
1.3 billion people of China.</P>
      <P>Christopher R. Hill, assistant secretary of the Bureau of East
Asian and Pacific Affairs, said the United States' policy on
cross-strait issues is clear and has been stated on a number of
occasions.</P>
      <P>"We want these issues resolved by peaceful means. Within this
context, our policy, which has been stated over and over again, is
our commitment to the one-China policy, our commitment to the Taiwan
Relations Act and the three communiques," Hill told reporters after a
House of Representatives hearing.</P>
      <P>Also commenting on Chen's remarks during a regular press
briefing, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said that
Washington's stance on these issues remains unchanged, noting that
the department last reiterated this in public with a statement by his
deputy J. Adam Ereli last week.</P>
      <P>"We have made no changes to our long-standing policy aimed at
promoting peace, stability and prosperity in the region. The United
States does not support Taiwan independence and opposes unilateral
changes to the status quo by either Taiwan or Beijing, " McCormack
said.</P>
      <P>"We support dialogue in the interest of achieving a peaceful
resolution of cross-strait differences in a manner that is acceptable
to the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait," he added.</P>
      <P>Ereli stated the policy on Jan. 30 in the wake of President
Chen's proposals that Taiwan should seriously consider scrapping the
National Unification Council and the National Unification Guidelines
and seeking to join the United Nations under the name of Taiwan. Chen
also proposed drafting a new constitution by the end of this year to
be put forth for a referendum in 2007.</P>
      <P>Ereli called Chen's speech "a surprise" and claimed that Taiwan's
participation in the U.N. under the name of Taiwan would represent a
"unilateral change to the status quo."</P>
      <P>In his inaugural speeches of 2000 and 2004, Chen pledged that if
China has no intention to use force against Taiwan, the country will
not declare independence, will not change the official name of the
country, will not include the "state-to-state" concept on
cross-strait relations in the Constitution, will not promote a
referendum to change the cross-strait status quo, and will not
abolish the National Unification Guidelines and the National
Unification Council.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TIGHTENING CROSS-TAIWAN STRAIT ECONOMIC POLICY RAISES U.S. CONCERNS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   Feb.  7  (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S.-Taiwan Business Council
expressed concern Tuesday over Taiwan's possible move to tighten
cross-Taiwan Strait investment projects and warned that such a move
could threaten Taiwan's technology competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The council issued the statement in response to ROC President
Chen Shui-bian's New Year address on Jan. 1, in which he said the
"proactive management, effective liberalization" policy on
cross-strait economic activities will replace the "proactive
liberalization, effective management" policy which has been in place
since a consensus was reached in the 2001 Economic Development
Advisory Conference. Chen said this means that the government must
take the responsibility of managing in order to effectively lower the
risks of liberalization.</P>
      <P>The council said Chen's announcement has signaled "a more
restrictive stance on cross-strait investments, " reversing Taiwan's
previous direction of moving to adopt more liberal China investment
policies that were expected to lead to a further relaxation of
regulations on Taiwan chip manufacturers wanting to set up shop in
China, including the approval of additional fab projects, the
transfer of 0.18-micron process technology, and the movement of chip
packaging and testing operations.</P>
      <P>Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the council, suggested that
Taiwan seek to raise its competitiveness through domestic economic
reform, instead of restricting cross-strait investment.</P>
      <P>"The economic challenge China poses to Taiwan cannot be solved
solely through restricting cross-strait investment," Hammond-Chambers
said.</P>
      <P>"A legal, liberalized and regulated cross-strait business
framework would allow Taiwan to benefit from further increases in
trade, increased tax revenue, repatriated profits and return of
overseas capital, and greater transparency in overall economic
activity," he added.</P>
      <P>He warned that the tightened restrictions on China-bound
investment will impact the entire technology supply chain.</P>
      <P>"The highly integrated nature of the technology industry, with an
increasing share of manufacturing taking place in China, means that
Taiwan's ability to continue as a significant partner, supplier and
customer to the industry is undermined," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEARLY ONE-THIRD OF BUILDINGS IN TAIWAN POSE HEALTH THREATS: STUDY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Jan. 8 (CNA)
(By Joy Wan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly one-third of the buildings in Taiwan
have been determined to be "sick buildings" that pose a health threat
to the inhabitants, with newly constructed or remodeled buildings
having the worst problems, the United Daily News reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Quoted a study conducted by National Cheng Kung University for the
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA), the paper said that the
indoor environments of about 30 percent of the buildings have poor air
quality, and the concentrations of methanal, bacteria and fungi are
higher than the standards set by the World Health Organization. </P>
      <P>The study identified poor design as the main reason for many of
the newer buildings being classified as "sick buildings" and poor
sanitation as the main reason for most of the remodeled buildings.</P>
      <P>Recently constructed and newly refurbished buildings exposed
their inhabitants to the risks of allergic and cardiovascular
diseases and even cancer with their fresh paint and decoration
materials which release chemicals.</P>
      <P>Central air-conditioning in old buildings, meanwhile, can lead to
poor air quality when filters are not cleaned or changed regularly,
and spores of bacteria and fungi can spread through ventilation
systems. </P>
      <P>Office buildings cause dangers in the workplace as machines like
old printers can release ozone, which causes emphysema and bronchitis
in some people. </P>
      <P>In addition, the study also found that about 30 percent of the
people have developed so-called "sick building syndrome, " which
includes such symptoms as sore throat, itchy skin, headaches and
inability to concentrate. </P>
      <P>Taiwan citizens spent over NT$4 billion a year between 1997 and
2003 on treating allergic and respiratory diseases, such as asthma
and allergic rhinitis, the newspaper cited statistics compiled by the
Bureau of National Health Insurance as saying.</P>
      <P>However, whether the illnesses are related to poor indoor
environments has not been determined, the paper said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO REQUEST FROM U.S. FOR PRESIDENT TO REAFFIRM 'FIVE NOES': MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Wednesday that it has not received a request from the United States
that President Chen Shui-bian reaffirm his "five noes" pledge.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Michel Lu was responding to news reports that the
Bush administration hopes President Chen will reaffirm his pledge in
the wake of his proposal that Taiwan should seriously consider
scrapping the National Unification Council and the National
Unification Guidelines.</P>
      <P>Otherwise, the reports quoted unnamed U.S. sources as saying,
U.S. President George W. Bush will not rule out the possibility of
openly criticizing President Chen when Chinese President Hu Jintao
visits the United States in April.</P>
      <P>Lu said that Taiwan has not received any such message during its
communications with Washington and that Taiwan will continue to step
up communications to allay U.S. concerns about President Chen's
remarks.</P>
      <P>Another MOFA official, who asked to remain anonymous, said that
President Chen has clearly restated the "five noes" pledge several
times and that the ministry has not received a clear message that the
U.S. has made such a request. President Chen has no need to reaffirm
the pledge, he added.</P>
      <P>"There is no need to worry about the talks between Bush and
Hu during their meeting in April" the official said, adding that if
Taiwan's communications with the U.S. are good, then "we don't have
to worry about the meeting."</P>
      <P>The ministry has communicated with the U.S. through the ROC
representative office in Washington, D.C. as well as the American
Institute in Taiwan, which represents U.S. interests in Taiwan in the 
absence of diplomatic ties between the two countries, over President
Chen's remarks.</P>
      <P>There is a perception gap between the U.S. and Taiwan, the
official noted, but the gap is not as serious as the news reports
have stated and there is no "crisis of confidence."</P>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Huang Chih-fang met with Dana Shell
Smith, acting AIT director, on Tuesday for the third time since
President Chen's Jan. 29 proposal, explaining that the proposal came
against the backdrop of worries that the cross-strait balance might
have tilted in China's favor following Beijing's enactment of an
anti-secession law in March 2005 and its wooing of Taiwan opposition
leaders, and that "Taiwan has no intention to change the cross-Taiwan
Strait status quo."</P>
      <P>President Chen made the "five noes" pledge in his 2000 inaugural
speech and again in 2004 that if Beijing has no intention of using
force against Taiwan, Taiwan will not declare independence, not
change its formal name, not include the "special state-to-state"
cross-Taiwan Strait relations into the Constitution, not promote a
referendum to change the status quo, and not abolish the National
Unification Council (NUC) and the National Unification Guidelines.</P>
      <P>The NUC, set up more than a decade ago by the former Kuomintang
administration, advocates the eventual unification of Taiwan and
China. Therefore, China has viewed the proposal to scrap the NUC as a
move toward de jure Taiwan independence, which Beijing has threatened
to stop by force.</P>

country's total exports for the year, the Bureau of Foreign Trade
(BOFT) reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Quoting tallies from the Directorate General of Customs, BOFT
officials said that Taiwan exported US$71.61 billion worth of goods
and services to China and Hong Kong in 2005, up 12.2 percent over the
year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to China's customs statistics, China's
exports and imports grew 28.41 percent and 17.73 percent,
respectively, for 2005, the BOFT officials said. Taiwan was China's
third largest source of imports for the year, behind only Japan and
South Korea.</P>
      <P>For January of this year, Taiwan's two-way trade amounted to
US$31.35 billion, down slightly by 1.1 percent from the level for the
same month in 2005, with exports totaling US$16.84 billion, up 4.5
percent, and imports amounting to US$14.51 billion, down 7 percent,
the officials said.</P>
      <P>As a result, Taiwan posted a trade surplus of US$2.33 billion for
January, marking a whopping increase of 359.7 percent over the
year-earlier level and the seventh consecutive month of trade surplus
increases.</P>
      <P>The BOFT officials attributed January's export expansion mainly
to expanded sales in digital cameras, electrical engineering products
and electronics.</P>
      <P>Although crude oil imports jumped by 64 percent for January due
to skyrocketing international oil prices, imports of all other
categories of products, including vehicles, iron and steel, machinery
goods, and organic and chemical products, posted substantial
declines, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials forecast that Taiwan's two-way trade will continue
to expand in 2006 due to a brisk global economy, with demand for
information technology, telecommunications and consumer electronic
products continuing to soar at home and abroad.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INNOVATION KEY TO TAIWAN'S COMPETITIVENESS: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 8 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday that
innovation is crucial to maintaining the competitiveness of Taiwan,
which he noted has transformed from a "copycat" to become an
excellent manufacturer of original products over the past several
decades.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during a meeting with winners of the
outstanding Taiwan inventor awards.</P>
      <P>Chen said he has had great admiration for inventors since he was
a child because they make the world a better and more hopeful place
through their intelligence.</P>
      <P>The president pointed out that Taiwan once bore the ignominious
title of "Kingdom of Counterfeiting, " but with the invention by
Taiwan of a large number of original products that have been marketed
around the world, "Made in Taiwan" has now become a mark of quality
products.</P>
      <P>In the highly competitive international market, inter-industrial
competition has expanded from lowering costs to comparing the speed
of research and development and the ability to create value, Chen
noted.</P>
      <P>To accelerate industrial upgrading, the government has been
promoting the "2008 national development project" to guide domestic
businesses to move towards focusing on high value-added research and
development, he said.</P>
      <P>He pledged that the government will continue to work to protect
intellectual property rights, develop more science-based industrial
parks, offer incentives for the technology industry and train
technological talent.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan-India association will be
established Feb. 11 in Taipei to boost bilateral ties between the two
countries, a ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) official said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lai I-chung, director of the DPP's Department of China Affairs,
noted that the association, which is the brainchild of DPP Chairman
Yu Shyi-kun and promoted by the Taiwan Thinktank, is aimed at
strengthening economic, trade, parliamentary, artistic and cultural
relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Lai, who once served as director of the Department of Foreign
Policy Studies of the Taiwan Thinktank, said the think tank had
already been paying much attention to India's development long before
the rise of the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China).</P>
      <P>In 2001, Taiwan Thinktank representatives engaged in strategic
dialogue with Indian authorities, while in 2004, the think tank
organized a seminar in Taipei on the promotion of Taiwan-Japan-India
cooperation. In 2005, the private think tank sent representatives to
India for a fact-finding visit.</P>
      <P>Lai noted that India represents an excellent market and great
opportunities, urging Taiwan entrepreneurs to diversify their
investment in India and increase exports to this emerging market, in
addition to introducing high-tech talent from this South Asian
country into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lai said he is not opposed to investment in China if it is
beneficial. However, he advised investors not to put all their eggs
in one basket and said they should do a thorough study of the markets
before making investments.</P>
      <P>In addition to India, other South Asian countries also boast
potential opportunities for investors, Lai added.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, the association will be composed of
governmental officials, including Economic Affairs Minister Hwang
Ing-san and National Science Council Minister Chen Chien-jen, as well
as academics, and representatives of industrial and trade
organizations and state-owned enterprises.</P>
      <P>In addition to trade and economic relations, the Taiwan-India
parliamentary exchanges will be another top priority for the
association, Lai said.</P>

While big newspaper companies in the United States are

events. Most rural areas don't yet have the same access to the Web

competition that has hurt major papers. Circulation at many smaller
papers is holding steady, even as their big-city brethren hemorrhage

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 8 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition Kuomintang (KMT) official said
Wednesday that it supports the Cabinet's new measures requiring 132
politically appointed officials to put their assets into trust but
complained that the measures are not comprehensive enough as they do
not cover investment funds.</P>
      <P>Under the measures, affected officials need only place
non-resident real estate and securities in trust, without specifying
whether their investment in funds or bonds are also included.</P>
      <P>"This shows the lack of thought that has been put into drafting
the measures, so it will be effective only in form, not in
substance," according to Pan Wei-kang, secretary-general of the KMT's
legislative caucus.</P>
      <P>According to Central Bank of China Governor Perng Fai-nan, public
bonds were not included in the mandatory trust list because no-one
can affect changes in the prices of public bonds.</P>
      <P>As for corporate bonds, Financial Supervisory Commission Chairman
Kong Jaw-sheng said ownership of a company's bonds is limited to a
certain number of shares and he claimed that there is "little
likelihood" of a politically appointed official rocking the stock
market, so corporate bonds are not included.</P>
      <P>In spite of the shortcomings of the measures, Pan said her caucus
would still like to give credit to the Cabinet for its interest in
running a government with integrity and competency.</P>
      <P>However, she said the party will keep pursuing previously exposed
corruption scandals involving senior government officials "until all
the truth is out."</P>
      <P>Her deputy, Tsai Chin-lung, said the Democratic Progressive Party
government's "integrity" measures underscore the fact that it has
failed on that account over the past five years.</P>
      <P>On the question of the legal validity of a government measure,
Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng said a government measure has
the same binding power as a law and thus should be followed by all

    <HEADLINE>KMT LAWMAKER CALLS FOR TRANSPORT LINKS IN EXCHANGE FOR ARMS DEAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 8 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator
Ting Shou-chung proposed Wednesday that the government open direct
transport links with China in exchange for legislative approval of a
major arms procurement bill.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference he called at the Legislative Yuan,
Ting urged the government of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) to accept his proposal to help break the current gridlock in
the legislature and assure peace and prosperity in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Should the government be willing to set up direct cross-strait
transport links, the KMT would be willing to help push for the arms
purchase bill's passage through the Legislative Yuan, Ting said.</P>
      <P>He asked the government not to oppose the links and to list the
spending for acquiring the weapons on the procurement list from the
United States in the government's regular annual budget at 3 percent
of Taiwan's gross domestic product.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that recent statements by President Chen Shui-bian
have tilted toward promoting "hasty Taiwan independence, " Ting
argued that the bill's passage in exchange for the links should help
the public realize that the arms procurement package does not signal
an endorsement for "hasty Taiwan independence." Doing so would also
bolster cross-strait activities, which is a keen hope of the United
States, he added.</P>
      <P>The weapons purchase package is in the interests of both Taiwan
and the United States, while direct transport services would serve
both Taiwan and China, and seeking stability and stepping up
exchanges across the strait is the common ground between China and
the United States, all of which indicates that cross-strait peace and
prosperity is in the interests of all three sides, he said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Kung-ping, spokesman for the People First Party (PFP) -- a
KMT partner in the opposition "pan blue alliance " -- said later the
same day, however, that there is no need for the opposition to rush
the major arms procurement bill through the Legislative Yuan, since
related situations at home and abroad remain unclear.</P>
      <P>As Chinese President Hu Jintao is slated to visit U.S. President
George W. Bush in April and Premier Su Tseng-chang has yet to respond
to a "pan blue" demand that he state the government's stance on the
issue, Hsieh commented that "pan blue alliance" should carefully
gauge the timing of when to deal with the bill.</P>
      <P>Hsieh reiterated that the PFP is not opposed to what it considers
a reasonable military procurement package and is open to holding
talks with other parties on the issue. But he added that it would
prefer to discuss the issue after Su has given his report detailing
policy priorities and budget allocations of his cabinet and after Hu 
and Bush have met.</P>
      <P>Hsieh further said that the PFP does not favor Ting's idea of
linking the military procurement to the cross-strait transport issue,
because doing so will only complicate both matters.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou has said publicly that his party will
put forward its own version of the major arms procurement package by
the end of this month or in early March, in the hope of forging
common ground with the DPP on the issue.</P>
      <P>The United States has repeatedly urged Taiwan to quickly settle
the issue to beef up its national defense network amid China's
growing military expansion.</P>
      <P>But the bill has failed to clear the Legislative Yuan 45 times
since mid-2004 due to objections from "pan blue" lawmakers who claim
that the arms procurement package proposed by the Ministry of
National Defense is too spendthrift for what the opposition claims
are "obsolete" items -- eight diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot
PAC III anti-missile batteries and 12 P-3C anti-submarine planes.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou was urged by a ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
official Wednesday to support President Chen Shui-bian's proposal to
consider scrapping the National Unification Guidelines and let the
people of Taiwan to decide Taiwan's future.</P>
      <P>Commenting on recent remarks by Ma that Taiwan's future should be
determined by its people, Tsai Huang-liang, director of the DPP
Department of Culture and Information, said that if Ma respects the
will of the Taiwan people, he should support the notion of having the
National Unification Guidelines scrapped so that the people can be
allowed to have a say on Taiwan's future.</P>
      <P>Tsai pointed out that both the National Unification Council (NUC)
and the National Unification Guidelines were established by the
former KMT government in the early 1990s with neither approval from
the legislature nor any consultation of public opinion.</P>
      <P>Likening what he described as the "totalitarian" NUC and National
Unification Guidelines to bondage for the people of Taiwan, Tsai said
that if Ma truly thinks that Taiwan's future should be determined by
the people, he should agree with Chen's proposal to let the people to
decide rather than resorting to the unrealistic KMT-designed
mechanism.</P>
      <P>In an article titled "Taiwan's Pragmatic Path" published in the
Asian Wall Strait Journal Tuesday, Ma said: "the KMT believes that
neither unification nor independence is likely for Taiwan in the
foreseeable future and that therefore the status quo should be
maintained. The island's future should be determined by its people

    <HEADLINE>CHINA IS REAL CROSS-STRAIT TROUBLEMAKER: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  8 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu accused China Wednesday of being the "real troublemaker"
that is attempting to change the cross-Taiwan Strait status quo
unilaterally through its ever-increasing military deployment against
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu said Taiwan will make every effort to maintain the
cross-strait status quo as long as China has no intention of using
force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Earlier that day, China's Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman Li
Weiyi said that President Chen Shui-bian's Lunar New Year's Day
speech violated his "five noes" promise and challenged Beijing's "one
China" principle. He also accused Chen of seeking de jure
independence for Taiwan by promoting constitutional re-engineering
and called Chen a "troublemaker" who is sabotaging cross-strait
relations and peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Li was referring to Chen's proposals that Taiwan should seriously
consider scrapping the National Unification Council and the National
Unification Guidelines and seek to join the United Nations under the
name of Taiwan, as well as drafting a new constitution by the end of
this year to be put to a referendum in 2007.</P>
      <P>In response to the criticism, Wu pointed out that despite
Taiwan's efforts to maintain the cross-strait status quo over the
past six years, Beijing has been expanding its military deployment
against Taiwan and relentlessly isolating Taiwan in the international
community.</P>
      <P>The situation worsened last year when China enacted its
Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan, which shows that China is the
one that poses the greatest threat to regional peace and stability,
Wu said.</P>
      <P>He continued that in addition to Taiwan, Japan and the United
States have also felt the military threat of China and its
potentially damaging effect on regional stability, with the Pentagon
recently identifying China as a potential military competitor of the
United States in light of China's increasing military buildup.</P>
      <P>He accused Beijing of paying lip service by repeatedly offering
to promote cross-strait exchanges and protect cross-strait peace,
noting that Beijing has rejected negotiations with Taipei on issues
regarding the launch of cross-strait chartered cargo flights and
allowing more Chinese tourists to enter Taiwan.</P>

representatives should complete putting their assets into trust by
April 24.</P>
      <P>Corporate bonds and public bonds held by Cabinet members are not
included in the trust list because Central Bank of China Governor
Perng Fai-nan said that no one can affect the fluctuation of public
bonds, while Financial Supervisory Commission Chairman Kong Jaw-sheng
said that the possibility of political appointees speculating on
corporate bonds to affect stock market fluctuations is "minimal."</P>
      <P>Kuan Kao-yueh, director in charge of government ethics at the
Ministry of Justice, said the political appointees will still have to
file reports to the Control Yuan, the nation's highest watchdog body,
on assets that are not required to be put into trust in accordance
with the Public Functionary Disclosure Law, and on the part of the
assets that have been put into trust, the professional financial
managers will have to file reports to the Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>The political appointees can instruct the trust managers to
dispose of the assets, although they will have to notify the ethics
department of the Executive Yuan on any transactions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATURE SPEAKER WOULD WELCOME PRESIDENT REITERATING 'FIVE NOES'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Wednesday that it would be highly welcome if President Chen Shui-bian
would reiterate his "five noes" pledge to alleviate unease stirred up
by his remarks on scrapping the National Unification Guidelines made
in his Lunar New Year's Day speech.</P>
      <P>Unfounded news reports have said recently that Chen's proposal to
consider scrapping the National Unification Council (NUC) and the
National Unification Guidelines had irritated Washington and that the
U.S. government does not exclude the possibility of President George
W. Bush criticizing Chen in front of Chinese President Hu Jintao when
the two meet in Washington in April.</P>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Huang Chih-fang said Monday that
David Ta-wei Lee, the Republic of China representative to the United
States, has been instructed to communicate with Washington over
Chen's remarks.</P>
      <P>Wang, who met with Chen Wednesday for talks on his recent trip to
Honduras and his transit stop in the United States, said the
Presidential Office will have to calm any controversy or
misunderstanding triggered by the remarks "before long."</P>
      <P>If it does not, Wang said, it could adversely affect U.S.-Taiwan
relations, cross-Taiwan Strait relations and even opinions in the
international community about Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen pledged clearly during his inauguration speech in May 2000
that as long as Beijing has no intention to use military force
against Taiwan, he will not declare independence, not change Taiwan's
name, not add the state-to-state theory into the Constitution, not
promote a referendum to change the status quo on independence or
unification, and not scrap the National Unification Guidelines --
commonly known as the "five noes" principle -- during his term of
office.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BALANCE BETWEEN FAMILY, CAREER A `FEMININE MYSTIQUE:' WOMEN'S GROUPS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 8 (CNA)
(By Debby Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is still difficult for Taiwanese women to
strike a balance between their family lives and careers, the leaders
of various Taiwanese women's groups said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Paying tribute to the late pioneer of the modern U.S. feminist
movement Betty Friedan, who died Feb. 4, the leaders said Friedan's
ideals have had substantial impact on the women's movement in Taiwan,
but it is still difficult to implement Friedan's later aspiration to
have women succeed with both family lives and careers.</P>
      <P>"Betty Friedan's most important heritage is her facilitation of
women's employment. However, the percentage of Taiwanese women in
employment is still low, even though the present 48 percent is a
record high, " PWR Foundation Chairwoman Liu Yu-hsiu said. The PWR
Foundation is Taiwan's leading women's group for promoting the
employment of women.</P>
      <P>"But U.S. liberal feminists like Friedan completely ignored the
childcare issue, assuming childcare to be the responsibility of the
private individual. Taiwan also follows this model, and that makes it
difficult for mothers to seek employment," Liu added.</P>
      <P>Liu said that to encourage mothers to remain in employment, it is
important that the government should provide comprehensive public and
affordable daycare service.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator-at-large Huang Sue-ying, also a leading women's
rights advocate, supported Liu's claim.</P>
      <P>"One major hurdle for mothers seeking jobs is the childcare
issue. Whether the government provides a daycare support mechanism
for mothers at work is a decisive factor," Huang said.</P>
      <P>"Another major hurdle is certain groups' attempts to make mothers
feel guilty about leaving their babies. They have created the
mystique that babies have to be cared for by their mothers, " she
claimed.</P>
      <P>Huang pointed out that according to the latest Council of Labor
Affairs figures, 67 percent of children under the age of three are
cared for personally by their mothers, while over 20 percent are
raised by relatives and only about 10 percent are put into daycare
services. She said this shows the inadequacy of daycare services in
Taiwan and claimed that consequently, mothers are not confident
enough in these centers to leave their babies there.</P>
      <P>Garden of Hope Foundation CEO Chi Hui-jung said that even in her
own organization, some female employees still choose to quit their
jobs and devote themselves completely to their children.
The foundation is Taiwan's leading women's group focusing on the
problems of adolescent girls.</P>
      <P>"They would rather choose to spend all their time with their
children. Even if they want to work, they want something that is
part-time and close to their homes," Chi said.</P>
      <P>"It is probably because Taiwanese couples are giving birth to
fewer children that mothers are willing to invest as much resources
and time as possible in their little ones," she added.</P>
      <P>Chi said some other female employees may decide to take leave of
absence to look after their babies for a year or two. Although the
foundation grants the leave, it offers no guarantee that their jobs
will still be there when the employees want to return.</P>
      <P>There are also incidences of female employees refusing promotions
for fear of work consuming too much of their family time, Chi said.</P>
      <P>"Although women can have day jobs now, they are still not
relieved of their family duties. Wives still spend more time doing
housework than their husbands. What I see is that women often pay a
higher price than their husbands to keep their jobs, " Chi said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE PRESIDENT, TOP PRESIDENTIAL AIDES TO PUT ASSETS INTO TRUST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu, as well as three
top aides to President Chen Shui-bian, will put their assets into
trust as soon as possible, officials from the Department of Public
Affairs at the Presidential Office said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The three top aides are Tan Sun Chen, secretary-general to the
president, and his two deputies, Cho Jung-tai and Ma Yung-cheng, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>They made the remarks after an Executive Yuan meeting passed a
package of regulations earlier in the day that requires senior
appointed government officials to place their assets into trust.</P>
      <P>Under the measures, 132 officials, including the premier, vice
premier, ministers and their deputies, their spouses and dependents,
will have to place into trust any real estate other than their
personal residences, as well as listed or over-the-counter stocks.</P>
      <P>The officials said the measures will help achieve the goal of
clean politics championed by President Chen and should also live up to
the expectations of the public.</P>
      <P>"The president was gratified that the Executive Yuan passed
the measures," they said.</P>
      <P>In order to carry out a pledge he made in a presidential election
debate Feb. 14, 2004, President Chen completed placing his assets
into trust April 14 of that year, the officials added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen has decided to place bonds
and mutual funds under her name into trust, even though the two items
are excluded from the latest regulations, Government Information
Office Minister Cheng Wen-tsang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>News reports cited information from the Control Yuan, the
nation's highest watchdog, to say that Tsai has invested
NT$82.7 million (US$2.56 million) in mutual funds and NT$82.73 million
in bonds, as well as NT$5.1 million in various businesses by 2005.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that she would voluntarily put her investments in
mutual funds and bonds into trust, but she said she filed a financial
report to the Control Yuan in 2005 that she had invested only
NT$334,983 in funds rather than the reported NT$82.7 million,
according to Cheng.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is looking forward to the opening of
passenger flight services between Taiwan and Mumbai this year, Civil

Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The civil aviation chief also said his office hopes to add a
fifth freedom -- the freedom of flying on to a third destination --

as this would make the flights between Taiwan and India more

      <P>In light of the fact that Taiwan's China Airlines (CAL) has
served the route between Taipei and New Delhi since April, 2002, the
service between Taiwan and Mumbai, if opened, will be provided by EVA

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT VOWS TO IMPROVE TAIWAN INVESTMENT CLIMATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 8 (CNA)
(By  Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Investment, jobs and consumer product prices
will be the top three priorities on the government's economic agenda
for 2006, President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the pledge during a Spring Festival gathering with
representatives from six major business and industry groups.</P>
      <P>Stating that the government has the resolve and determination to
clear hurdles to improve Taiwan's overall investment climate and help
companies maintain their operations and make greater domestic
investments, Chen said that government services in land acquisition,
capital, technology, environmental protection and labor affairs will
be upgraded.</P>
      <P>Chen called for vision and realization of the fact that China is
not the sole or last outlet for Taiwan's economy in the world and
that it is wrong to pin the hopes of Taiwan's economic and industrial
development on China. Taiwan-China economic ties should not be
simplified to an opening-tightening policy dispute, he said.</P>
      <P>According to the president, only continued investment will inject
impetus for a country's economy to grow sustainably, including China,
which has benefited greatly from huge amounts of foreign direct
investment.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, Taiwan has performed brilliantly in various
fields, with its December 2005 jobless rate dropping to 3.86 percent
-- a new low since March 2001, he said.</P>
      <P>As the country's finances have also noticeably improved, the
national coffers collected an extra NT$184.6 billion in tax revenues
last year -- well exceeding the government's target, he said,
attributing the growth to increases in income tax revenues and
describing it as an indication that people's incomes have increased.</P>
      <P>Looking back at Asia's economic development path since the Second
World War, Japan was the front runner among all countries in the
region, he said. Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore -- the
"four little dragons" -- came after Japan and before Thailand, the
Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia came into the spotlight, he said,
adding that China is now the rising star on the world stage.</P>
      <P>Taiwan identity and the country's advantages are the key points
that he must consider when drawing up a blueprint for Taiwan's future
development, Chen said, insisting that Taiwan should set its sights
on the entire world and walk the right path for continued progress.</P>

      <P>The runways of the Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport, Taiwan's gateway to the world, will undergo
their largest overhaul in more than 20 years at the end of the year,
Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the airport's two runways are up to
international standards, but noted that they have been in use for
more than two decades and the chances of their needing to be repaired
will be more frequent in the next two to three years.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, they said, the CAA is promoting a comprehensive
automation of navigation guidance systems on the ground and that the
two projects will go hand in hand.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the cost of the two projects will be around
NT$7 billion (US$217.39 million), they added.</P>
      <P>The officials said that during the overhaul period, the runways
will be shut down alternately. The shutting down period will be
between six months and one year, affecting landings and take-offs.</P>
      <P>The officials said they have already been coordinating with air
carriers in the hope of mitigating the impact, but it has been
preliminarily estimated that plane schedules could be delayed by
around 20 minutes on average and even longer during busy periods.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Transportation and Communications Minister
Kuo Yao-chi said Wednesday she was determined to open the nation's
longest tunnel to passenger cars by June.</P>
      <P>Kuo said the 12.9-km tunnel on the Taipei-Ilan expressway will be
open only to small passenger cars in the first stage of public use.
However, she said, safety measures must be in place for all types of
vehicles before the tunnel could be used by them.</P>
      <P>Her safety standards were a bit different from her predecessor,
Lin Ling-san, who said the tunnel could be open to drivers as soon as
it met with safety requirements for small passenger cars.</P>
      <P>The center of controversy about the tunnel's safety has been
ventilation fans, 40 of which have been put in place but "not yet
properly installed, " Kuo said. Test runs for the last fan in the
northern exit will not begin until the end of March, according to
ministry officials.</P>
      <P>"Since people are concerned about the tunnel's safety, the
government certainly must take full responsibility to address their
concerns," she said.</P>
      <P>While many have been urging the government to complete all
preparations as soon as possible, "We must see to it that all details
are up to professional requirements and safety must be ensured, " Kuo
said.</P>

(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Even though Taiwan is widely viewed as the
most socially open-minded about lesbian literature in Asia,
publishing it is still an uphill battle in Taiwan, independent
publishers said Wednesday on the sidelines of the Taipei
International Book Exhibition (TIBE).</P>
      <P>"I am determined to spend my last penny on publishing lesbian
literature, to make Taiwanese people understand it more and respect
lesbian culture," said the principle of Must Muster Publisher, known
as "Hsiao-yu." "And we are talking about Taiwan -- widely regarded as
the leading East Asian country in lesbian literature."</P>
      <P>"It's not easy to be an independent publisher in Taiwan focusing
on lesbian literature, which is still struggling to gain the
recognition and popularity it deserves," said Chang Mo-lan, the
principle of Northern Light Publishing Company.</P>
      <P>The nature of lesbian literature makes it hard to be profitable
for publishers, Hsiao-yu said. "Lebians and gays buy books written by
heterosexual writers. But most heterosexuals don't read lesbian and
gay literature."</P>
      <P>The best-selling title of Must Muster Publisher sold about 6,000
copies, while Northern Light's bestseller sold less than 4,000
copies. The numbers pale in comparison with titles on the best-seller
list, which is compiled by chain bookstores.</P>
      <P>The government should do more to help the cause of literature and
sexual equality, Hsiao-yu said. "Most of our titles are 'R' rated and
have to be sealed ... But how do you expect teenagers who are trying
to find out about their true sexual orientation to understand
themselves with this measure?"</P>
      <P>According to the Measure Governing the Rating Systems of
Publications and Pre-recorded Video Programs, restricted publications
must be sealed and carry a label on the cover reading "R rated: Not
available for those 18 or under."</P>
      <P>Most people have the misperceptions about homesexuality, which
is why Hsiao-yu and Chang Mo-lan, who both came out as lesbians, try
to promote lesbian literature.</P>
      <P>"People think about sex and violence when they think about
homsexuality. And that really is the wrong perception," Hsiao-yu
noted.</P>
      <P>"Hopefully, the success of 'Brokeback Mountain' will help people
understand more about same-sex relationships and pay more attention
to homosexual literature," Chang Mo-lan said, citing Taiwanese
director Ang Lee's award-winning film based on the true story of two
gay cowboys.</P>
      <P>"This is a free world, where I think everyone -- including
homosexuals -- have the right to voice an opinion, and where all kinds
of human relationships should be respected, " Hsiao-yu concluded.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian visited an
exhibition featuring antique photographs of Taiwan, some dating
back more than 130 years and shown here for the first time, at the
14th Taipei International Book Exhibition (TIBE) Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, entitled "1871-2006: Formosa from the Earth and
from the Air," features more than a hundred photographs. The oldest
pictures were taken in April 1871 by John Thomson, a Scottish
photographer based in Hong Kong at the time.</P>
      <P>Catching sight of a photo taken circa 1871 showing a Taiwanese
aborigine and his retriever, President Chen jokingly said the dog in
the photograph just might be the ancester of the dog in his house.</P>
      <P>The exhibition is a collection of photographs belonging to Rene
Vienet, a French documentary film director, who is also a member of
the board of directors of Locus Publishing, a Taiwanese publishing
company.</P>
      <P>"This exhibition of old photos about Taiwan is very important
because it gives people a rare glimpse into how life was at that
time. The best way to keep track of all that has happened in the past
and recorded by photograph is to establish a museum of photography,"
Vienet said.</P>
      <P>Vienet said that as of yet, no museum of photography exists in
Taiwan, but that he'd found people interested in such a project and
that it wasn't difficult to materialize.</P>
      <P>Photographic negatives from the images shown in the exhibition are
kept at the Wellcome Library in the United Kingdom.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese Taipei will try again to host the
Olympic Congress in the future after failing in its latest bid in
Turin, Italy, a senior sports official said Wednesday. Copenhagen was
chosen to stage the 13th Olympic Congress, beating Athens, Riga,
Singapore, Taipei, Busan and Cairo.</P>
      <P>Huang Chi-huang, deputy minister of physical fitness and sports,
said Taiwan had done its best to prepare for winning the right to
host the Congress, such as making plans for delegates to stay in a
five-star hotel less than 10 minutes from a conference center which
is big enough to seat over 2,000 people.</P>
      <P>He said the National Council on Physical Fitness and Sports also
won the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' support to facilitate visas for
International Olympic Committee-recognized delegates to enter Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As the 2009 Congress will be held in conjunction with the
Executive Board meeting, when a new IOC chairman will be elected,
Huang said it was unsurprising that a European city was chosen to
stage these functions.</P>
      <P>In order to boost Taipei's chances, Sports Minister Chen
Chuan-shou, Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee Chairman Tsai Chen-wei
and Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou visited Turin.</P>
      <P>Chen Shih-kui, Tsai's secretary-general, said in Turin that
Taipei actually did quite well in the balloting because it was not
eliminated until the fourth round.</P>
      <P>"This is the first time Taipei has applied to host the Congress,
while Copenhagen was making its third attempt," he noted.</P>
      <P>Both Chen and Huang said Taiwan would continue trying to host the
Olympic Congress, where all parties of the Olympic Movement meet to
define the main development axes for the future.</P>
      <P>Huang said, "We won't give up just because of a frustrating
moment. We will keep trying to win the chance to host international
conferences and competitions in a bid to eventually host the Olympic
Games."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  7  (CNA)
(By Taijing Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's popular literature is very
well-received in the Chinese-speaking book market, a bookstore owner
from Macau said at the 14th Taipei International Book Exhibition
(TIBE) Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lawrence Wang has come to the TIBE for the sixth consecutive year
to purchase or order books he sells back in his 40-square-meter
bookstore in Macau. The best-selling books in his hometown, he says,
are works of popular literature from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has the most vibrant publishing industry in the
Chinese-speaking market. It has developed in various domains. There
are more Chinese-language best-sellers published here than in other
countries in Asia," Wang added.</P>
      <P>Lin Jeng-feng, manager of the publishing company Pan Asia
International, said the major trend in the Chinese-language
publishing industry will be a move toward novels and travel books
written by young authors.</P>
      <P>The TIBE, which lasts until Feb. 12 this year, is considered the
largest annual book fair in Asia, and known as the place where
authors and publishers can meet and book lovers can buy cheaper
books.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LONG JOURNEY FROM READERS TO LESBIAN LITERATURE PUBLISHERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  8 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A love of reading and a strong lesbian
awareness are what helped two publishers embark on the long and
difficult journey from readers to lesbian literature publishers, they
said Wednesday on the sidelines of the Taipei International Book
Exhibition (TIBE).</P>
      <P>The two publishers -- the head of Must Muster Publisher, known as
"Hsiao-yu, " and Chang Mo-lan, head of Northern Light Publishing Co.
-- said there will be no regrets, since it's a self-imposed task they
have volunteered to shoulder. Both companies specialize in lesbian
literature.</P>
      <P>As a lesbian and an avid reader, Hsiao-yu's life path was changed
six years ago in a matter of minutes.</P>
      <P>"I saw a book titled 'Why homosexuality is a sin' in a bookstore
and was shocked. Voices of the homosexuals should be heard, I said to
myself at the time," she said.</P>
      <P>"If a bookstore is a garden, I would like to see a garden with
flowers of all colors," Hsiao-yu said, indicating that lesbian
literature should be respected and understood.</P>
      <P>With a dream, a mere 700,000NT in capital and two staff members
to assist her, Hsiao-yu established Must Muster Publisher in 2000,
the first publisher in Taiwan specializing only in lesbian
literature. Six years later, the company has published around 50
titles and brought together a network of over 50 lesbian writers.</P>
      <P>Chang Mo-lan, a writer for Must Muster, then established her own
publishing company in 2004, Northern Light, which has published more
than 10 titles.</P>
      <P>"It's not an easy road for me. I am prepared to be sued at any
time since most of our publications are R-rated and have to be
sealed, a demand I refuse to accept and practice. And once in a
while I get phone calls from people telling me I am endangering
society, but I try to hold my ground," said Hsiao-yu, who used to
work part-time as a kindergarten teacher to make ends meet.</P>
      <P>Working full-time for her company, Chang Mo-lan feels fortunate
that her publications are sold in chain bookstores like Eslite and
Kingstone with the help of an agency.</P>
      <P>"But I have to stop writing and focus on things like
administration and marketing instead," she lamented.</P>
      <P>One thing is certain: Hsiao-yu and Chang will continue to be
friendly competitors. They promote each other through their
advertisement, an uncommon practice in the publishing business.</P>
      <P>"We work together to cultivate this tiny market and make it grow,
not compete with each other," Chang said.</P>
      <P>"My biggest wish is that someday I can close down my company,
knowing that every major publisher will be publishing lesbian
literature," Hsiao-yu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA SHOULD DROP MILITARY THREAT AGAINST TAIWAN: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China should drop its military threat
against Taiwan to facilitate the cultivation of mutual trust across
the Taiwan Strait, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wu was responding to China's accusation that President Chen
Shui-bian was a "troublemaker" for his Lunar New Year's Day speech
calling for discussion on scrapping the 15-year-old official
guidelines on cross-strait unification.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Chen had on numerous occasions declared his
willingness to uphold his "five noes" pledge to stabilize
cross-strait ties as long as China had no intention of using military
force against Taiwan, Wu said China, with its continued military
buildup and missile deployment targeting Taiwan, was unqualified to
blame Chen or talk about "cross-strait mutual trust."</P>
      <P>The "five noes" pledge, outlined in Chen's 2000 inaugural
address, ncludes no scrapping of the unification quidelines.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, Wu said, China had enacted a so-called
"Anti-secession" law targeting Taiwan, and expanded its
Taiwan-targeting military exercises in moves that unilaterally
changed the Taiwan Strait status quo. Against this backdrop, Wu said,
China itself was the biggest threat and destroyer of peace in the
Taiwan Strait and throughout East Asia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT VOWS TO PROMOTE USE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 8 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday the
government will promote the use of recyclable and renewable energy to
cope with steady crude oil price hikes and maintain domestic price
stability.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while attending a Chinese New Year
gathering with representatives of six major trade and industrial
associations in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan relies heavily on imports for its energy
supply, Chen said Taiwan must accelerate restructuring of its energy
use by promoting the use of cleaner and renewable energy resources.
Taiwan should also make every possible efforts to upgrade efficiency
of energy use.</P>
      <P>In the new year, Chen said the government's econmic and trade
policies will focus on investment, employment and consumer price
stability.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan stocks rose significantly earlier this week
while most other Asian stocks were dropping, Chen said he believed
the country's economy will see stable growth this year.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, Taiwan's economy has performed exceptionally
well in several respects, such as setting new records in the volume
of both exports and imports, and the unemployment rate dropping to
3.86 percent in December -- the lowest since March 2001.</P>
      <P>In addition, government finances made significant gains last
year, with tax revenues far exceeding the original target, Chen
added.</P>
      <P>Analyzing post-World War II economic trends in Asia, Chen said
Japan was the first to recover from the war, and then Taiwan, South
Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore -- the so-called "four Asian dragons."</P>
      <P>Now people are talking about the "rise of China, " Chen said,
adding that every country or area had its own "economic golden age."</P>
      <P>Although China now enjoys an annual economic growth of between 8
and 9 percent, it will have its limits and its economic growth will
begin to wind down, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Chen urged domestic investors to diversify their investments,
reminding them to keep their options open throughout the world.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Representatives from a pro-independence
group staged a protest at the Taipei office of the American Institute
in Taiwan (AIT) Wednesday over U.S. opposition to President Chen
Shui-bian's recent call for scrapping the 15-year-old official
guidelines on unification across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen Yi-shen, deputy president of the Northern Taiwan Society,
led a group of association members demonstrated at the AIT Taipei
office.</P>
      <P>They said the U.S. authorities' explicit opposition to Taiwan's
popularly elected president's remarks was in violation of
international protocol of no interference in other country's internal
affairs.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chen said, the U.S. opposition to the proposed
scrapping of the unification guidelines also ran against the
self-determination democratic principle advocated by U.S. founding
fathers.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the people of Taiwan have legitimate right to
decide on their own their country's future relations with China, Chen
said the U.S. government and people should support Taiwan people's
pursuit of freedom, democracy and equality.</P>
      <P>The protest ended peacefully after an AIT staff member accepted
the group's petition letter. AIT represents U.S. interests in Taiwan

    <HEADLINE>KMT STUDYING FEASIBILITY OF 'DIRECT LINKS-ARMS PURCHASE' TRADE-OFF</HEADLINE>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will
study the feasibility of a trade-off between two long-stalled
projects with the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration,
a party official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Chen Ming-yi said the proposed trade-off between
the KMT-favored early opening of direct transport links across the
Taiwan Strait and the DPP administration-initiated plan to procure
three big-ticket weaponry items from the United States was discussed
at the weekly meeting of the KMT's decision-making Central Standing
Committee (CSC).</P>
      <P>The trade-off was broached by KMT Legislator Ting Shou-chung, who
is also a KMT CSC member.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the proposal was hotly debated at the CSC
weekly meeting chaired by Wu Poh-hsiung, a KMT vice chairman. Many
CSC members, including John Kuan, another of KMT vice chairmen,
Taichung Mayor Jason Hu and Legislator John Chiang.</P>
      <P>After heated discussions, Chen said, Wu ruled that the proposal
be sent to the KMT's policy research department for a comprehensive
review. The department is also required to come up with a report on
the propriety and feasibility of the trade-off proposal, Chen added.</P>
      <P>The KMT and its "pan-blue alliance" ally, the People Fist Party,
have used their slim majority to block the DPP administration's plan
to purchase eight diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot
anti-missile batteries and a squadron of 12 Orion submarine-hunting
aircraft for more than a year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP URGES 'PAN-BLUE' TO HELP SET UP ANTI-CORRUPTION AGENCY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  9 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) urged the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" Thursday to work with the ruling party in the amendment of
a law governing the registration of officials' private assets.</P>
      <P>The DPP caucus also called on the Kuomintang (KMT) and People
First Party lawmakers to join in efforts to establish an
Anti-Corruption Agency that would implement relevant laws.</P>
      <P>The DPP caucus made the calls following the Executive Yuan's
adoption Wednesday of a set of measures requiring 132 politically
appointed officials to put their assets in trust, measures that the
opposition criticized as incomprehensive and lacking teeth.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yi-jin, secretary-general of the caucus, said the measures
are but an "administrative decree" that do not have binding power and
will not produce substantive results. Yeh said that she will
therefore suggest that the opposition parties work with the DPP in
amending an existing law so it will have legal binding power on
targeted officials.</P>
      <P>In addition to giving the Cabinet measures a legal basis by
amending the law, a special Anti-Corruption Agency should also be
established that will be responsible for punishing violators of the
law, Ye said.</P>
      <P>The draft Organic Law for the agency has been blocked from being
put on the legislative agenda 68 times, she said, urging the KMT

    <HEADLINE>MOF DEFENDS INSPECTION MEASURES FOR ALCOHOL IMPORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  9 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Defending the country's new inspection
measures on imported alcoholic products that have been criticized by
a European business group as posing an "unnecessary obstacle to
trade, " the Ministry of Finance (MOF) said Thursday that Taiwan is
not the only country in the world that has adopted such measures.</P>
      <P>The ministry asserted that the inspection measures are consistent
with the WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and
Phytosanitary Measures and are necessary to facilitate the
government's crackdown on counterfeit goods to protect European
products.</P>
      <P>In a review report released Wednesday, the European Chamber of
Commerce Taipei (ECCT) accused Taiwan of violating its obligations
under the World Trade Organization (WTO) , in the wake of Taiwan
imposing from Jan. 1 a new measure requiring certain types of
imported alcoholic products to be tested for methanol, sulphur
dioxide and lead. The measure will apply to all types of alcoholic
products starting July. 1.</P>
      <P>The ECCT claimed that Taiwan is the only country in the world to
have such a requirement, which the group said will "force the smaller
amounts of imports out of the market" and make the importation of
high-end wines difficult "due to the risk of having several
high-price bottles confiscated on arrival for testing purposes."</P>
      <P>In response to the report, the MOF issued a statement dismissing
the ECCT claim as "unfactual," pointing out that similar measures are
in place in other countries, including the United States, Austria,
Chile and South Korea.</P>
      <P>The MOF clarified that the testing is not being conducted on
"each product" as the ECCT claimed.</P>
      <P>The MOF noted that the inspection measures include
shipment-by-shipment inspection, sampling inspection and
documentation-supported clearance, with shipment-by-shipment
inspection applicable only to imported non-beverage alcohol products.</P>
      <P>For other types of alcohol imports, including high-price wines,
they can go through customs clearance without being opened for tests
as long as sanitary certificates are presented, the MOF said.</P>
      <P>For imports for which sanitary certificates are not presented,
they will only be sampled for tests at random, and there is only a
five-percent probability that any shipment will be tested, the MOF
said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the sanitary certificates will remain valid for two
years, while products that have passed a test will also be exempt
from any more tests for two years, it said.</P>
      <P>Fully aware of the excellent alcohol-making practices of European
producers, the MOF has listed most European Union members, the United
States, New Zealand, Australia and Japan as countries with complete
systems on alcohol management, with exports from these countries only
needing to present certificates issued by specialized organizations
of alcoholic drink producers for customs clearance in Taiwan, the
ministry said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREREQUISITE OF 'FIVE NOES' NO LONGER EXISTS: PFP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 9 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian agreed to reiterate
his "five noes" pledge, without emphasizing the prerequisite that
Beijing renounce the intention to use force against Taiwan, before
meeting with People First Party Chairman James Soong early last year
for the sake of peace across the Taiwan Strait, a senior PFP official
disclosed Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chang Hsien-yao, director of the PFP Policy Center, said that if
the president made it a point that his "five noes" policy was based
on China's renunciation of the intention to attack Taiwan militarily,
he would clearly be "telling a lie."</P>
      <P>Recalling the background of the much-watched Chen-Soong meeting
on Feb. 24, 2005, Chang claimed that after the meeting, Chen's
"prerequisite" of making his "five noes" commitment changed -- to the
current situation of "five noes without any preconditions."</P>
      <P>Chang said that in President Chen's two inaugural addresses,
in 2000 and 2004, Chen did specify that his "five noes" commitment
was hinged on China giving up its intention to attack Taiwan with
force.</P>
      <P>Chang then explained why that changed, saying that he personally
passed Soong's message to Chen's staff before they formally met on
Feb. 24 requesting that Chen take the initiative in showing goodwill
and sincerity toward China by reiterating his "five noes" pledge,
without mentioning the prerequisite.</P>
      <P>The "five noes" refers to Chen's pledge that during his time in
office as president of the Republic of China, he will not declare
Taiwan independence, not change the nation's official title, not push
for inclusion of the "state-to-state" description of cross-strait
relations into the Constitution, not hold a referendum on
independence versus unification, and not abolish the National
Unification Guidelines.</P>
      <P>Then presidential deputy secretary-general Huang Chih-fang told
the Soong camp that making the "five noes" pledge alone had angered
fundamentalists in the independence movement, so it would be even
more difficult for Chen to remove the prerequisite for the "five
noes," Chang said.</P>
      <P>But Soong insisted that if Chen could not agree to his request,
then this would mean that Chen still wanted to pursue an independence
agenda and that it would be pointless for them to meet, according to
Chang.</P>
      <P>The haggling went on until 9: 00 a.m. on the meeting day, when
Huang called the Soong party to say that the president had finally
agreed to Soong's request, noting that the president would not push
the independence agenda but rather would focus on maintaining the
status quo.</P>
      <P>Only when the Soong side got that message did the two sides
proceed to a formal meeting, resulting in a 10-point consensus that
began with a statement reaffirming the status quo under the ROC
Constitution, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang said that he met with U.S. officials based in Taiwan after
the Feb. 24, 2005 meeting, telling them about the background. So the
United States is aware that Chen had accepted Soong's request of not
mentioning the prerequisite while reaffirming his "five noes" pledge,
he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 1,675 metric tons of smuggled
farm produce was destroyed in 2005 under government efforts to deter
smuggling and stabilize production and marketing orders of Taiwan's
agricultural sector, officials from the Council of Agriculture (COA)
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Garlic, mushrooms, apples, dried day lilies, powdered grains,
betel nuts and peanuts made up the bulk of the farm produce
destroyed, COA officials said.</P>
      <P>In an effort to protect Taiwan farmers' interests and keep
smuggled animals and plants from undermining Taiwan's domestic
livestock sector and farm production, the COA has for years had in
place the policy of destroying confiscated agricultural products
considered by the council to be highly threatening to domestic
production and quarantine protection, COA officials said.</P>
      <P>Last year, the COA added 30 fishery items to the list of smuggled
farm produce subject to "destruction" upon confiscation. The newly
added fishery items include oysters, baby abalone, squid, crabs and

working hard is what Taiwan needs most at present, President Chen

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATURE HAS NO RIGHT TO INTERFERE IN CONTROL YUAN NOMINATIONS: DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan has no right to
interfere with the list of Control Yuan nominees, a caucus whip of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Yeh Yi-jin made the comment after several of her
colleagues from the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) urged President
Chen Shui-bian to redraw the name list.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Wu Yu-sheng said at a news conference
earlier the same day that the Control Yuan nominees do not evenly
represent the various walks of life in Taiwan society and that they
tend to be older and were nominated for political reasons.</P>
      <P>"There should be overall considerations in rewriting the Control
Yuan nominee list," Wu urged, adding that nominee Clement C. P. Chang
should be replaced because of his age. Chang is 77.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that President Chen has the right to nominate the
Control Yuan president, vice president and 27 other members in
accordance with the Constitution, and the legislature has no say in 
the nomination and only has "the right to exercise consent."</P>
      <P>In response to opposition lawmakers' request that three of the
nominees -- Liu Yuh-san, Wu Feng-shan and Chang Fu-mei, who have been
appointed as secretary-general of the Executive Yuan,
minister-without-portfolio, and minister of the Overseas Chinese
Affairs Commission, respectively -- be replaced, Yeh said that the
president will do so.</P>
      <P>On KMT lawmakers' request for a Constitutional amendment to raise
the threshold from the consent of one-half of all lawmakers to
two-thirds to confirm the Control Yuan nominees, Yeh said that the
party will adhere to the amendment if it is passed.</P>
      <P>The terms of the previous Control Yuan members expired in January
2005, and their successors nominated by the president have been
blocked by the opposition-controlled legislature from being
confirmed. The opposition lawmakers have claimed that some of the
nominees do not live up to the expectations of the public. The
nation's highest watchdog body has thus been left vacant for more
than a year.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 9 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Honorary Chairman Lien Chan
expressed his hope Thursday that direct transportation links with
China would be launched, with bans on exceptional cases.</P>
      <P>Lien, who lost as KMT candidate in two presidential elections,
made the remarks during a lunar New Year social event attended by
business professionals from the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>"No country can ever turn its back on the tourism industry, " he
said, an apparent reference to the government's ban on Chinese
tourists traveling directly to Taiwan from China.</P>
      <P>When the KMT stepped down in 2000, Lien said, Taiwan's tourism
industry was seven million strong.</P>
      <P>"After the Democratic Progressive Party came into power, the
economy hasn't been doing well, and even with efforts to double the
number of tourists over the past six years, the industry has barely
returned to its 2000 level," he added.</P>
      <P>One of his New Year's wishes was that the statute governing the
relations of people in Taiwan and in China would be amended so that
direct transportation links would be set up in principle, with bans
on exceptional cases, because "liberalization is a global trend, " he
said, without elaborating further.</P>
      <P>As for the local tourism industry's hope that the government
would allow all Chinese tourists to enter Taiwan, Lien said that
currently, only those who hold third-country residencies or who are
traveling in a third country can visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He suggested that legislators and industry representatives
organize a special visit to China to determine the scope of the
problem. If the solution could be found in China, he said, they
should ask the Chinese government to help; and if the problem lies
within Taiwan's jurisdiction, they should demand the government solve
it.</P>
      <P>Lien also said that regular weekend charter flights should be
launched as soon as possible between Taiwan and China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLA TO REVIEW FOREIGN CAREGIVER HIRING PROCEDURES IN SIX MONTHS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said
Thursday that it will review the procedures surrounding the
employment of foreign caregivers in six months.</P>
      <P>CLA Chairman Lee Ying-yuan made the remarks one month after a
new set of regulations on hiring foreign caregivers took effect.</P>
      <P>Under the new regulations, the "long-term care management
centers" -- operated by city or county governments -- would help
mediate contracts between local caregivers and qualified patients,
and only those who cannot find a local caregiver after two attempts
at mediation can apply to hire a foreign caregiver. The procedure is
expected to take about 14 days.</P>
      <P>Lee said the present low success rate for hiring local caregivers
was normal in the preliminary stage of a new policy, and that the
council would "review and adjust" the policy within six months.</P>
      <P>Huang Mei-na, head of the DOH's Bureau of Nursing and Health
Services Development, noted that local caregiver centers had yet to
succeed in finding even one local caregiver for the patients who
needed them.</P>
      <P>But Huang said that she was not discouraged, saying that if
the success rate could reach just one percent, it would be considered
satisfactory.</P>
      <P>Huang said it was to be expected that the success rate would not
be high in the initial stages, but she hoped that after a public
awareness campaign, the number of local caregivers hired would
increase.</P>
      <P>The new policy was put into practice in January, amid doubts it
would be able to meet the huge demand by local patients who are in
great need of home care service -- an estimated 300,000 locals need
long-term in-home care and at the same time encourage the employment
of local caregivers instead of the much cheaper labor provided by
foreign caregivers -- the aim of the policy planners.</P>
      <P>To encourage families to hire local caregivers, the government is
offering a subsidy of NT$10,000 (US$312) per month per person for a
specific period of time, depending on the individual patient's
condition.</P>
      <P>In the past, the CLA strictly screened the applications of
foreign live-in caregivers in terms of the Barthel's index of
activities of daily living, a way to assess the degree of an
individual's disability. Only those who receive a score of less than
30 points -- mainly physical aspects of disability -- are eligible to
hire a live-in caregiver from abroad.</P>
      <P>Under the new policy, local hospitals form evaluation commissions
composed of physicians, nurses and social workers in order to weigh
each patient's need for care -- 24-hour care, full daytime care or
part-time care. The hospitals will then pass their appraisals to the
"long-term care management centers."</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHIEF WARNS OF SERIOUSNESS OF SCRAPPING UNIFICATION GUIDELINES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Feb.  8 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou warned
Wednesday that "serious consequences" may result from implementing
President Chen Shui-bian's idea of scrapping the National Unification
Council and the National Unification Guidelines.</P>
      <P>Ma issued the warning upon arrival at the Geneva airport from
Turin, Italy to continue his five-nation European tour while
answering questions from reporters. The Republic of China's
Representative to Geneva, Shen Lu-hsiun, also greeted Ma at the
airport.</P>
      <P>Although President Chen proposed the idea without mentioning
specifics on putting it into practice, Ma said he wanted to remind
the president that such a plan would trigger grave consequences if
carried out, as evidenced in Washington's reaction.</P>
      <P>Stating that the goal of the KMT's cross-strait policy is to
achieve peace and prosperity for Taiwan, Ma stressed that he will
advocate a "third path" for Taiwan -- maintaining the status quo
while boosting bilateral exchanges and mutual understanding across
the strait -- apart from the options of independence or unification.</P>
      <P>Ma is slated to fly to London Thursday evening after his visits
here.</P>
      <P>Chen said on Jan. 29 Lunar New Year's Day that the time may be
right to ponder dissolving the council and its guidelines as China
had failed to renounce the use of force against Taiwan. Chen's
remarks immediately drew backlash from the United States by
reiterating its opposition to any unilateral changes made by either
Taiwan or China to the cross-strait status quo.</P>
      <P>According to Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who met with
President Chen Wednesday, Chen aired the controversial view about
scrapping the National Unification Council and its guidelines to
counter Ma's "eventual unification" theory, which the president
viewed as a violation of the Taiwanese people's right to decide their
own future.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmaker Lai Shyh-bao said Thursday in Taipei that Ma had
raised the unification theory to explain the "one China" spirit as
stipulated in the ROC Constitution. What Ma focuses on, he said, is
maintaining Taiwan's status quo.</P>
      <P>The "eventual unification" that Ma referred to must be based on
preconditions of peace and equitable prosperity on both sides of the
strait and with the consent of Taiwan's people, Lai said, adding that
what Ma talked about did not exceed the framework of the National
Unification Council or its guidelines.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmaker Wu Yu-sheng accused the president of playing
hardball by saying that he had unfairly interpreted Ma's remarks to
the foreign media as a way of shifting the public's attention from
the government's poor performance.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian expressed the hope
Thursday that volunteer services in Taiwan will continue to expand
through public commendation of outstanding volunteers around the
country.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while receiving recipients of the the 20th
annual "Golden Camel" volunteer service award.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that during his 2000 presidentical election campaign,
he had pledged to work toward the materialization of a "volunteer
Taiwan, knowledge-based Taiwan, humanistic Taiwan."</P>
      <P>To realize that promise, Chen said, he has declared his inaugural
anniversary of May 20 "Taiwan Volunteer's Day," and has served as a
volunteer on that day every year since 2001 -- including the day he
was sworn in to a second term in 2004.</P>
      <P>He announced that May 20 of this year will be the sixth time
he has served as a volunteer.</P>
      <P>The president said he hoped the charitable deeds of the "Golden
Camel" award winners would be widely noted in Taiwan so they would
become role models to emulate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INDIGENOUS GROUP DRAFTING GENDER, SEXUAL AFFILIATION EQUALITY LAW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Folks from the Truku Tribe are discussing
adding text concerning gender and sexual affiliation equality into
the indigenous group's autonomy law in order to reflect the tribe's
respect for human equality.</P>
      <P>Members of the Truku tribe in the Central Mountain Range near
Hualien County are drafting the group's self-governance law, which
will include the point that all residents living in the Truku Tribe
Autonomy District are equal, regardless of gender, sexual
affiliation, religion, ethnicity, social class or political
affiliation.</P>
      <P>The points on equality will also include the recognition of
same-sex marriage and surrogate motherhood among the Truku people.</P>
      <P>If this Truku autonomy law -- which has been developed and
discussed with the help of sociologists, anthropologists and Truku
elders over the past few years -- is passed and takes effect after
the long-stalled draft bill on autonomy of aboriginal people is
passed into law by the Legislative Yuan, it would be a pioneering
paradigm of human rights in Taiwan and probably the first of its kind
in the world, said Tiela Youdao, executive director of the Promote
Truku Tribe Autonomy Committee.</P>
      <P>The Truku people -- the 12th officially recognized indigenous
group in Taiwan -- have been keenly hoping that President Chen
Shui-bian will facilitate legislation on the autonomy bill for
aboriginal people, as he promised Taiwan's indigenous people on at
least two occasions, in 1999 and 2002, to improve the well-being of
Taiwan's "original natives" and support their rights and interests.</P>
      <P>In the event the draft aboriginal autonomy bill continues to be
blocked in the Legislative Yuan, Tiela said, the Truku people will
still observe the Truku autonomy law as constitutional law and
implement it within the Truku District immediately after the Promote
Truku Tribe Autonomy Committee has approved it.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA POLICY DEBATE NECESSARY: DPP CAUCUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  9 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) defended Thursday a party decision
to hold open debate on its China policy, despite objections from some
DPP heavyweights.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yi-chin, a DPP legislative caucus whip, said it is good and
necessary to have open debate on the party's policy line toward China
to forge a consensus, because its various factions remain sharply
divided on the issue.</P>
      <P>"Regardless of President Chen Shui-bian's position, Taiwan's
future should be determined by its people, and the DPP has decided to
craft its China policy jointly and to shoulder any results of this
policy collectively," she said.</P>
      <P>Yeh's remarks came after Vice President Annette Lu and former
Premier Frank Hsieh, among others, voiced opposition a day earlier
during a DPP Central Standing Committee meeting to holding a debate
on the DPP's China policy in March.</P>
      <P>Chen said late last month that he was seriously considering
scrapping the National Unification Council and the National
Unification Guidelines in response to China's failure to renounce the
threat of military force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, Chen made his statement in an effort to avert
Taiwan from tilting toward China after main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou told foreign media that Taiwan would seek
eventual unification with China.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks drew flak from the various parties concerned,
including the United States, which called Chen's words "inflammatory"
and reiterated its stance that it opposes unilateral changes by
either Taiwan or China to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait.</P>

      <P>The chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) reiterated Thursday that the DPP leadership
supports any move to scrap the National Unification Council -- a
government agency founded in 1990 when the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) was in power to promote Taiwan's eventual unification with
China.</P>
      <P>Yu Shyi-kun told a gathering of DPP members in Tainan, southern
Taiwan, that Taiwan's future should be determined by its 23 million
people, whether the result be unification with China or an
independent Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the government cannot violate the spirit of
democracy by making unification with China the only option for its
people.</P>
      <P>The DPP chairman's remarks came amid growing controversy over
President Chen Shui-bian's proposal on Jan. 29 -- Lunar New Year's
Day -- to scrap the National Unification Council and the National
Unification Guidelines.</P>
      <P>Also, commenting on an ongoing investigation by the Tainan Public

      <P>Implicated in the fraud case are DPP legislators Chiu Yung-jen

      <P>Taiwan will meet Pakistan in the 2006 Davis
Cup tennis tournament Asia/Oceania Zone Group first round starting
Friday, hoping that this year, the home court advantage will help it
avenge its loss to Pakistan last year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan lost 4-1 to Pakistan last year in the Asia/Oceania second
round, while Pakistan advanced to the world group playoffs and
was swept by Chile -- it's the best-ever performance.</P>
      <P>Led by Wang Yue-tzuoo, who ranks 87th in the latest ATP world
rankings, Taiwan will benefit from the hard-court surface most of its
players are familiar with instead of the grass courts they had to
face last year in Pakistan.</P>
      <P>Two singles matches will be played Friday, with Wang Yue-tzuoo
taking on Aqeel Khan and Chen Ti meeting Pakistan's best player Aisam
Qureshi, who boosted his profile after defeating Paradorn Srichaphan
in a first round upset for Thailand last year and currently ranks
429th in the world.</P>
      <P>Wang will team up with Yi Chu-huan in the doubles Saturday and
meet Quereshi and Khan. On Sunday there will be two reverse singles
matches.</P>
      <P>The matchup applies the best-of-five format, as the team who wins
three points first advances to the second round, where it will meet
either South Korea or India.</P>
      <P>The Pakistan team arrived in Taipei Wednesday and expressed
satisfaction with the court after practice, although they were
worried about the temperature, which had dropped to 11 degrees
Celsius in Taipei, said Quereshi.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 9 (CNA)
(By Debby Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Pro-Taiwan independence groups are teaming
up with each other to seek abolition of the National Unification
Council and the National Unification Guidelines.</P>
      <P>The most visible groups were mostly established around the time
of Chen's first inauguration. These include the "four societies of
Taiwan": Taiwan Society North, Taiwan Central Society, Taiwan South
Society, and Eastern Taiwan Society.</P>
      <P>The societies consist mostly of Taiwanese intellectuals who
usually voice their support or criticism of the government's policies
through press statements or op-ed pieces.</P>
      <P>There are also groups that focus more on grassroots action and
rallies, such as the Hand-In-Hand To Save Taiwan Alliance. The
alliance made headlines when it mobilized over one million Taiwanese
people to take to the streets on Feb. 28, 2004 for a peaceful rally
against China's military threat.</P>
      <P>"We were created to help the Taiwanese government cultivate
Taiwan-centric values in this land," the secretary-general of Taiwan
Society North, Chet Yang, said. His society was formed in 2001.</P>
      <P>Yang said the main differences between the newly founded
pro-independence groups and the longer-standing ones were their
organizational structure and their pro-active use of media resources.</P>
      <P>"I described my own group as up-and-coming because we use the
latest models of business communication and branding techniques. To
achieve our goals, we try to operate like a business," Yang said.</P>
      <P>Yang expressed concern that the independence movement has moments
of inertia, and said that it was partly because the movement was too
closely linked with the governing party and electioneering.</P>
      <P>"I always say that while President Chen Shui-bian has the 'five
noes' principle, the independence movement also has its own 'five
noes': no one will take action if there are no elections, no
political stars, no free meals, and no buses to move them around, "
Yang said.</P>
      <P>"To a certain degree, it is important that the pro-independence
movement should be separated from the government, otherwise when
people become disillusioned with the government they become
disillusioned with the movement as well," Yang said.</P>
      <P>Hand-in-Hand To Save Taiwan Alliance executive convener Ng
Chiau-tong also said certain tensions existed between the
pro-independence groups and the government due to their different
interpretations of Taiwan's national status.</P>
      <P>"The DPP reckons that Taiwan is already a sovereign state called
the Republic of China, while we believe Taiwan isn't a de facto state
yet,"Ng said.</P>
      <P>"But President Chen is governing with the DPP's line of
reasoning, and when he said last year that it wasn't possible to
draft a new constitution, many pro-independence supporters were
disappointed and criticized Chen," Ng said.</P>
      <P>Still, Ng finds it necessary to collaborate with the government.</P>
      <P>"Pro-independence groups need to work with the DPP government
because if we don't, the movement will slow down," Ng said.</P>

      <P>Parents or guardians of children will be
held liable for prison terms of up to five years if they desert
children placed under their care, the Children's Bureau under the
Ministry of the Interior said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials made the remarks amid a recent controversy
surrounding a mother in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan, who abandoned her
five children, the eldest, a 10-year-old.</P>
      <P>The officials said the Children and Youth Welfare Law stipulates
that parents or guardians carry the responsibility of protecting and
raising their children, and that authorities are allowed to fine
those who have violated the law between NT$30,000 (US$932) and
NT$150,000 -- and publish their names.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Code also stipulates that those who desert children
are subject to prison terms of between six months and five years, the
officials added.</P>
      <P>They said child desertion may often be attributed to parents who
are facing severe economic pressure or who want to avoid the
responsibility of caring for their children.</P>
      <P>They said that the government has set up a special hotline to
provide assistance to abused children. It has also set up a
counseling service to provide assistance to families in distress.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  9 (CNA)
(By Taijing Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is the bridge that allows the
European Union's publishing industry to access the huge
Chinese-language market, as both Taiwan and the E.U. are targeting
this lucrative market, the head of the Bureau International de
l'Edition Francaise (BIEF) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>BIEF Director-General Jean-Guy Boin said during a round table
discussion at the 14th Taipei International Book Exhibition (TIBE)
that publishing industries in both Taiwan and China have good
printing techniques but that Taiwan is a better environment for E.U.
publishing to enter the greater Chinese market because it protects
copyright better than China.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's role as the E.U.'s bridge to the Chinese book market is
developing. Taiwan and Europe share similar economic cultures and the
same language is spoken in Taiwan and China," Boin said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the greater Chinese-language market is
getting more and more interested in French lifestyle publishing,
which include domains such as the arts, fashion, cooking and
architecture.</P>
      <P>Agreeing with Boin's point of view, the deputy director of the
European Economic and Trade Office (EETO), Frederic Laplanche, said
that more translators are needed so that "lifestyle" books can be
more accessible to Chinese-language readers.</P>
      <P>Laplanche said that the turnover of the E.U.'s publishing
industry last year is roughly 120 billion euros, which represents 0.5
percent of the E.U.'s GDP and around 50 percent of Taiwan's GDP.</P>
      <P>Taipei Book Fair Foundation (TBFF) Chairman Rex How said that the
E.U. is best equipped to cooperate with Taiwan because both parties
"often find themselves on the same wavelength."</P>
      <P>Taiwan also has advantages in helping E.U. enter the Chinese
market as it is a free and open market with an established operating
procedure with professionals who respect the industry's ethics, said
How.</P>
      <P>But he cautioned that while publishers are looking forward to
the future of China's publishing market, the truth does not seem to
be that optimistic. Statistics show that last year, a considerable
number of foreign publishing companies withdrew from China as a
result of difficulties encountered there.</P>
      <P>These companies were not prepared enough and if they had
cooperated with Taiwan before entering China, the results could have
been different, How claimed.</P>
      <P>The TIBE, now in its 14th year, started Feb. 7 and will run
through Feb. 12.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 9 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged people around
the country Thursday to identify cultural landmarks and folk customs
in their communities in an effort to develop the nation's tourism
industry.</P>
      <P>Chen said that since tourism is based on cultural assets, if
Taiwan wanted to successfully develop its tourism industry, efforts
must be made to "discover" places with local flavor that could
potentially gain local and international attention.</P>
      <P>In an article carried in the latest edition of his online
newsletter, Chen said development of Taiwan's tourist industry will
bring about many benefits, including an increase in local employment
opportunities, economic resources for community development and a
negligible environmental impact.</P>
      <P>Mentioning various festivals celebrated throughout Taiwan --
including the children's folkgames festival in Ilan, the black tuna
fish cultural festival in Pingtung, and the Lotus Festival in Tainan,
the president noted that many city and county governments have
begun exploring their folk legacy as a way to boost the local
economy.</P>
      <P>These local activities not only bring plenty of economic benefits
but also preserve local customs, Chen said, adding that folk
festivals offer people the opportunity to learn about local culture
and the history of where they were born.</P>
      <P>Chen cited three traditional activities for the upcoming Lantern
Festival: the launching of Sky Lanterns in Pinhsi, Taipei County; the
Yenshuei Fireworks Display in Tainan County; and the tradition of
throwing fireworks at the Hantan Deity in Taitung. He invited all
tourists, whether local or foreign, to get a taste of some of
Taiwan's magnificent folk traditions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-CHINA FISHING COOPERATION MUST BE KEPT IN LINE: OFFICIALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 9 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Fishing cooperation between Taiwan and China
must correspond to the government's China policy, a spokesman for the
Fisheries Administration under the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture (COA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman made the remarks after China's Ministry of Commerce
announced a day earlier that China has decided to resume bilateral
cooperation by allowing fisherman to work aboard Taiwan fishing boats
and urged private sector groups from the two sides to clinch
cooperation agreements as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Affairs Office under the Beijing-based State Council
claimed that it had reached consensus on salaries, insurance and
deposits for Chinese fishery workers with three Taiwan-based
organizations. China stopped allowing its fishery workers to work on
Taiwanese boats at the end of 2001.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that none of the three groups that Beijing mentioned
have government authorization to negotiate with China, Fisheries
Administration officials called on Taiwan's fishing industry to act
in compliance with the law and said that cross-Taiwan Strait
fisheries collaboration also needs to follow the government's China
policy.</P>
      <P>Since late 2001, when China halted fisheries cooperation with
Taiwan, the government has tried hard to reduce Taiwan's reliance on
Chinese fishermen through various measures, effectively breaking down
China's containment, the officials said.</P>
      <P>According to officials of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) , Beijing's unilateral appointment of Taiwanese groups
to negotiate is aimed at creating chaos in Taiwan -- a move that they
said fully reflects China's unwillingness to negotiate with the
Taiwan authorities.</P>
      <P>They also said that it will be a violation of the law if any
private organizations from Taiwan engage in talks with China that
require government authorization.</P>
      <P>Fu Dong-cheng, head of the MAC's Department of Economic Affairs,
said that unless Beijing has worked out counter-productive measures,
whatever package it has will not have a big impact on Taiwan's
existing mechanisms for hiring Chinese fishermen.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taiwan has about 6,130 Chinese fishermen working on
its fishing boats, Fu said</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT TO CONTINUE TO COMMUNICATE WITH CHINA OVER MAJOR ISSUES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will
continue to seek opportunities to exchange views with Chinese
officials over major issues concerning the well-being of the people
on both sides of the Taiwan Strait after the holding of a
KMT-proposed economic forum in Taiwan was boycotted by the
government, a high-ranking KMT official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, deputy CEO of the KMT Policy Committee, said
that as the party's plan to host an economic forum between the KMT
and the Communist Party of China (CPC) -- originally scheduled to be
held in Taipei last December -- was aborted, the KMT will adopt a
"breaking down the whole into parts" strategy to continue efforts to
increase exchanges with Beijing officials to seek possible solutions
to major cross-strait issues that are important to the people from
both sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>The "pressing" issues that the KMT will seek to tackle include
Chinese citizens' visits to Taiwan as tourists and the opening of
regular passenger and cargo charter flight services across the Taiwan
Strait, Chang added.</P>
      <P>Chang declined to confirm whether the KMT will continue to seek
to host such a forum, to which Chen Yunlin, China's top official in
charge of Taiwan affairs, was originally scheduled to attend at the
head of a 60-member Beijing delegation.</P>
      <P>Chang pointed out, however, that allowing Chen and other Beijing
officials to come to Taiwan to attend the forum might be a good plot
to help President Chen Shui-bian out of his current predicament,
since his proposal to consider scrapping the National Unification
Council (NUC) and the National Unification Guidelines, made during
his Lunar New Year's message, had "irritated Washington."</P>
      <P>Unfounded news reports have said recently that the U.S.
government does not exclude the possibility of President George W.
Bush criticizing Chen in front of Chinese President Hu Jintao when
the two meet in Washington in April.</P>
      <P>The KMT applied to the Mainland Affairs Council and the Bureau of
Immigration late last year for permits allowing the Beijing officials
to enter Taiwan, but the application was rejected.</P>
      <P>Referring to the abortion of the KMT-CPC forum plan, honorary KMT
Chairman Lien Chan lamented that it was "tremendously pitiful" that
the Democratic Progressive Party government has missed a golden
opportunity to enhance face-to-face communications with ranking
Chinese officials in charge of Taiwan affairs.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Tough
U.S. Steps in Hunger Strike at Camp in Cuba

United States military authorities have
taken tougher measures to force-feed detainees
engaged in hunger strikes at Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba, after concluding that some were determined
to commit suicide to protest their indefinite
confinement, military officials have said.
In recent weeks, the officials said, guards 
have begun strapping recalcitrant detainees 
into "restraint chairs," sometimes for hours a 
day, to feed them through tubes and prevent 
them from deliberately vomiting afterward. 
Detainees who refuse to eat have also been placed
in isolation for extended periods in what the 
officials said was an effort to keep them from 
being encouraged by other hunger strikers.


Wall Street Journal: Catching a Wave, As
Satellite Firms Move to Add Cellular Service,
Critics Cry Foul

As tiny telecommunications companies 
offering service on bulky satellite phones are
allowed to use the license for its slice of the
airwaves, known as spectrum, for more than just 
satellite service, they can use it for cellular
calling as well, or to provide other services
such as wireless access to the Internet. These
companies are aggressively trying to market.
Critics say something is wrong with this picture.
"The FCC's giveaway to satellite providers
was an outrage," charges J.H. Snider, a director
of research for the New America Foundation, a
Washington think tank. "It was like the
federal government leasing mining rights to
federal lands and later throwing in oil rights
for free."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT ECONOMIC INTEGRATION VITAL FOR TAIWAN: AMCHAM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  9 (CNA)
(By Debby Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham)
voiced Thursday its support for the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council's
call for better cross-strait economic integration, but declined to
take a position on President Chen Shui-bian's controversial Chinese
New Year statement.</P>
      <P>In response to Chen's statement in which he said it might be
worth considering abolishing the National Unification Council and the
National Unification Guidelines, the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council
said Feb. 7 that the statement "signaled a more restrictive stance on
cross-strait investment" and that Taiwan's domestic politics and
strained ties with China are seen to be threatening the country's
technological competitiveness.</P>
      <P>"We agree with the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council's stressing of
importance of economic integration between Taiwan and China, " AmCham
Executive Director Richard Vuylsteke said. "The best way to boost
Taiwan's domestic investment and attract foreign investment in Taiwan
is to facilitate cross-strait economic integration," he added.</P>
      <P>Vuylsteke said the council's statement reiterates the "factual
side of things" that AmCham has been saying and should be read as
"constructive suggestions" or like "a warning shot across the bows."</P>
      <P>"Domestic economic reform is important to raise Taiwan's
competitiveness, and competitiveness is important for the companies
the chamber represents, " Vuylsteke said.</P>
      <P>Vuylsteke said that most companies the chamber represents have
operations in both Taiwan and China and that further restrictions on
cross-strait investment would make Taiwan less competitive.</P>
      <P>"But the chamber is not ready to take a stand on President Chen's
statement yet. We are worried, but we are not panicking, " he said.
Vuylsteke said the president's speech did not necessarily
reflect what his next move will be.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to deliver a speech to AmCham Feb
23.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OFFICIAL ON KINMEN AMID REPORTS OF HUMAN CASE OF BIRD FLU IN FUJIAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen, Feb. 9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior Department of Health (DOH) official
traveled to the Taiwan-held outlying island of Kinmen Thursday to
inspect epidemic prevention measures there amid reports of a new
human case of avian flu in the southeastern Chinese province of
Fujian.</P>
      <P>DOH Deputy Minister Chen Tsai-chin inspected epidemic control
measures at Shuitou Port, which is the hub for direct shipping
services between Kinmen and the Fujian port city of Xiamen.</P>
      <P>Noting that Kinmen, which lies closer to Fujian than to Taiwan,
is the second-largest "entrepot, " after Hong Kong, for passengers
traveling between China and Taiwan proper, Chen said the DOH wants to
make sure that no loopholes exist in the epidemic prevention
mechanism at Shuitou Port.</P>
      <P>"We must be on guard to avert an invasion of bird flu from China,
"Chen said.</P>
      <P>Despite the report of the new human case of avian flu in Fujian,
Chen said the DOH will not consider suspending direct shipping
services between Taiwan's two islands of Kinmen and Matsu and
Fujian's ports of Xiamen and Mawei for the moment.</P>
      <P>"This is not the first time that a human case of bird flu has
been reported in Fujian. We'll not consider shutting down the direct
shipping links unless there is a further spread of the disease
there," Chen said.</P>
      <P>As China's bird flu situation is unclear and not transparent,
Chen said Taiwan people traveling to China should avoid coming into
contact with wild birds or poultry and should keep vigilant about
their own health.</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire service reports, a 26-year-old woman in
Fujian has contracted bird flu, becoming at least the 11th person to
be infected with the disease in China, seven of whom have died.</P>
      <P>China's Health Ministry confirmed that the Fujian woman tested
positive for the H5N1 strain of bird flu, Beijing's official Xinhua
News Agency said.</P>
      <P>Xinhua said that there has so far been no outbreak of bird flu
among birds detected in the area of Fujian's Zhangpu County, where
the woman lived. People with close contact with her before she fell
ill have been "put under medical observation, " Xinhua said, without
giving specifics.</P>
      <P>Since 2003, bird flu has killed 88 people -- most of them in
eastern Asia but also including four in Turkey and one in Iraq -- and
has decimated poultry populations.</P>
      <P>While most of the human infections have been linked to direct
contact with sick poultry, experts have warned that the virus could
mutate into a form that is easily transmitted between people,
sparking a global flu pandemic that could kill millions.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 9 (CNA)
(By Debby Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
the international community's "over-tolerance" of China's military
threat toward Taiwan is creating "serious imbalances" in cross-Taiwan
Strait relations.</P>
      <P>"The international community's over-tolerance of China's military
build-up and war preparations against Taiwan, gradually pushing the
cross-strait situation to the brink of war short of a formal
declaration, and disregard of Taiwan people's outcry... have all
resulted in the misjudgments for the serious imbalances now exist in
cross-strait political and military relations, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>"Consequently, Taiwan's democracy, as well as the Asia-Pacific
'community of democracies, ' the United States, and Japan's security
interests in West Pacific, are now imperiled," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen made the statement Thursday at a spring banquet for foreign
ambassadors and representatives in Taiwan hosted by Minister of
Foreign Affairs James Huang in Taipei and attended by representatives
from over 60 countries including acting American Institute in Taiwan
Director David Davison. Chen, Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su
Tseng-chang and Examination Yuan President Yao Chia-wen were also
present.</P>
      <P>Chen used the occasion to urge the international community to
re-examine cross-strait relations. He said that since 2000, his
government has extended "more than 40 olive branches of peace to
China" and acted on the principles of "goodwill reconciliation,
pro-active cooperation and permanent peace" in the hope of opening
cross-strait dialogue and reconciliation.</P>
      <P>"Establishing a 'peace and stability framework for cross-strait
interaction' satisfies the collective expectations that the United
States, Japan and other members of the international community have
for permanent peace in the Taiwan Strait and for the maintenance of
the cross-strait status quo," Chen said.</P>
      <P>"However, over the past six years, China's leaders have never
responded with goodwill to our calls for resumption of dialogue...
China continues to aggravate the Taiwan people's sentiments by
employing tactics such as military intimidation, political subversion
and attempting to bring about unification by coercing the business
community into complying with their agenda," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen said China's intention and capability to use force against
Taiwan is a "publicly known secret, " and "it has made preparations
to materialize such intent."</P>
      <P>He said that as the elected leader of Taiwan, he cannot allow
imbalances in cross-strait relations to "continue to deteriorate." He
said Taiwan's future cannot be decided unilaterally without "the
consent of the Taiwan people through democratic processes, " as the
right to self-determination is a universal value.</P>
      <P>"It is my earnest hope that the voice of Taiwan's democracy would
galvanize the support of international justice from the global
community," Chen said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  9 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three members of the U.S. House of
Representatives offered Wednesday their support for ROC President
Chen Shui-bian, whose recent proposal to scrap an organization and
guidelines symbolic of Taiwan's objective to unify with China has
raised concerns in Washington.</P>
      <P>In their statement released at the House, Scott Garrett (R-N.J.),
Pete Sessions (R-Texas) and Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.) praised Chen as a
peace-loving national leader and expressed their approval for Chen's
repeated commitment to maintaining the cross-Taiwan Strait status quo
and tempering tensions across the strait.</P>
      <P>Expressing concern over the enactment of the Anti-Secession Law
by China last year, the military buildup of the People's Liberation
Army and China's missile deployment targeting Taiwan, they said it is
necessary for the U.S. government to reiterate its stand against the
use of force to resolve cross-strait differences, and they urged
Beijing to respect the Taiwan people's strong desire to be their own
masters.</P>
      <P>Garrett noted that President Chen has proposed scrapping the
National Unification Council because he does not want unification to
become the only option for the future development of cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Sessions pointed out that the House passed a
resolution by an overwhelming vote of 424-4 last year to voice its
concern over the enactment of the Anti-Secession Law, which he said
shows that there is a very high degree of consensus among members of
the House expecting Beijing to abolish the law and maintain peace
across the strait.</P>
      <P>In a speech given on Lunar New Year's Day on Jan. 29, Chen
proposed that Taiwan should seriously consider scrapping the National
Unification Council and the National Unification Guidelines and
seeking to join the United Nations under the name of Taiwan. Chen
also proposed drafting a new constitution by the end of this year to
be put forth for a referendum in 2007.</P>
      <P>Responding to the speech, U.S. State Department officials
reiterated that the United States' long-standing policy aimed at
promoting peace, stability and prosperity in the region remains
unchanged and that Washington does not support Taiwan independence
and opposes unilateral changes to the status quo by either Taiwan or
Beijing.</P>
      <P>The officials stressed that the U.S. government supports dialogue
between Taiwan and China to achieve a peaceful resolution of their
differences, in a manner that is acceptable to the people on both
sides of the strait.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  9  (CNA)
(By Wennie Chi and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The leader of a Washington-based
pro-Taiwan independence group urged the U.S. government Thursday to
renounce what he dubbed its outdated "one China" policy.</P>
      <P>Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA) President C.T. Lee
made the call in support of ROC President Chen Shui-bian's recent
proposals that Taiwan should seriously consider scrapping the
National Unification Council and National Unification Guidelines and
seeking to join the United Nations under the name of Taiwan and
should draft a new constitution by the end of this year to be put for
a referendum in 2007.</P>
      <P>"The 'one China' policy should be dumped into the ashes of
history, " Lee said. "The fate of Taiwan should be determined by the
people of Taiwan, not jointly by the people on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait, which is absurd."</P>
      <P>Lee urged the United States to view matters from Taiwan's
perspective, asking Americans to imagine if someone suggested that
the fate of America be jointly decided by people on both sides of the
Atlantic Ocean when Americans were striving to achieve independence
centuries ago.</P>
      <P>He noted that FAPA on Feb. 3 wrote to U.S. President George W.
Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to urge them to support
Chen's proposals.</P>
      <P>Washington officials have reacted to the proposals by reiterating
that the United States' "one China" policy remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>They said the United States does not support Taiwan independence
and opposes unilateral changes to the status quo by either Taiwan or
China and that Washington supports dialogue between the two sides to
achieve a peaceful resolution of cross-strait differences in a manner
that is acceptable to the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEST TIME TO SCRAP NUC WAS LAST MARCH: NATIONAL POLICY ADVISER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The best time to have scrapped the National
Unification Council (NUC) and the National Unification Guidelines was
last March when China enacted its Anti-Secession Law targeting
Taiwan, a national policy adviser to President Chen Shui-bian said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Ruan Ming made the remarks in the wake of President Chen's recent
proposal that Taiwan should seriously consider scrapping the NUC and
the National Unification Guidelines, which has raised concerns in
Washington.</P>
      <P>Ruan said the two "should have been abolished a long time ago, "
although he suggested that President Chen should have proposed doing
away with them in March 2005 when China passed the Anti-Secession
Law, which gives Beijing a legal base to use force against Taiwan
should the island move toward formal independence.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan had done so at that time, there would have been
nothing that China or the United States could have done, " Ruan
claimed.</P>
      <P>The NUC and the National Unification Guidelines, which advocate
eventual unification with China, were established by the former
Kuomintang administration in 1990. The scrapping of the two is
perceived by China as a move toward de jure independence, which
Beijing has threatened to use force to stop.</P>
      <P>Ruan said that Taiwan does not need to notify the U.S. prior to
the scrapping of the NUC and the National Unification Guidelines,
just as the U.S. does not have to notify Taiwan on many things,
citing the severance of diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 as
an example.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is a sovereign independent country, " Ruan stressed, and
there is no need to inform the U.S.," he said.</P>
      <P>Reports have said that the U.S. is not pleased with the
president's proposal mainly because it is afraid of offending Chinese
President Hu Jintao, Ruan said.</P>
      <P>He said that the United States has not asked President Chen to
reaffirm his "five noes" pledge and that related remarks on the U.S.
side are meant for Hu, because the latter will visit the U.S. in
April, and the United States does not want extra trouble.</P>
      <P>President Chen pledged in his 2000 inaugural speech and again in
2004 that if China has no intention of using force against Taiwan, he
will not declare independence, not change the nation's formal name,
not include the "special state-to-state" definition of cross-Taiwan
Strait relations into the Constitution, not promote a referendum to
change the status quo, and not scrap the NUC and the National
Unification Guidelines.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is tightening the spread and
transfer of key, sensitive technologies to other countries,
including China, with the drafting of a technology alert list, the
Economic Daily News reported Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-jen, minister of the National Science Council (NSC) ,
said that while staying ahead has been the priority of Taiwan's
technology development, it is also imperative that national security
and the public's interests be protected.</P>
      <P>The proposal of the technology alert list, which includes land
and resources, seed science and technology, satellites, space, and
hydrological sciences, to name a few, will contribute to this, the
daily quoted Chen as saying.</P>
      <P>The draft bill, which is now awaiting review in the Legislative
Yuan, aims to establish a mechanism that protects sensitive
technologies related to national security and prevents them from
being spread to other regions and countries, including China, without
state permission, the paper reported.</P>
      <P>The paper said that the draft bill came as a response by the NSC,
Taiwan's science and technology policy-making body, to President Chen
Shui-bian's new "proactive management with effective liberalization"
policy announced last month.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Taiwan's science and technology development should
have its focus on the global market, rather than China alone, the
paper said.</P>
      <P>Setting up 8-inch wafer plants and transferring related
technologies abroad, including to China, in this regard will be
forbidden, if the draft is signed into law.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT SUPPORTS TAIWAN, NOT BEIJING: PARTY CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Feb.  9 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairman of Taiwan's main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) denied here Thursday that the KMT's cross-Taiwan
Strait policies are tilted toward Beijing, saying that the KMT
unwaveringly supports Taiwan and its people.</P>
      <P>At a press conference held prior to his departure for London,
visiting KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said that the KMT's stance on
cross-strait relations is starkly different from that of the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government, but he added that this
should definitely not be translated as he and the KMT being
"pro-Beijing."</P>
      <P>Ma noted that the KMT firmly advocates closer cross-strait
exchanges and the opening of direct postal, trade and transportation
links between Taiwan and the Chinese mainland. This advocacy, he
said, is devised purely to reflect the stance of the Taiwan
businesspeople operating in China, with the hope that the China-based
Taiwan businesses will make more money and become more competitive in
the world market.</P>
      <P>On the DPP's lashing out at him and the KMT for supporting
unification with China, Ma said the KMT indeed considers "ultimate
cross-strait unification" as one of the options in the party's
cross-strait policy, but he stressed that the unification must be
achieved under circumstances where China has evolved into a country
of freedom, democracy and prosperity, and the majority of the Taiwan
consent to the unification idea.</P>
      <P>Ma pointed out, however, that currently none of the conditions
for the implementation of the cross-strait unification have matured
and the KMT has no timetable in this regard.</P>
      <P>Noting that the goal of the KMT's cross-strait policy is to
achieve peace and prosperity for Taiwan, Ma reiterated that the KMT
will advocate maintaining the status quo while boosting bilateral
exchanges and mutual understanding across the strait.</P>
      <P>Responding to a Hong Kong journalist's question, Ma said he has
not been invited by Beijing for a visit and he does not think that
now is the right time for him to visit China.</P>
      <P>On his goals and responsibility as chairman of the main
opposition party in Taiwan, Ma said straightforwardly that he will
see to it that the KMT wins back ruling power in the 2008
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Despite widespread speculation that the KMT will be the favorite
in 2008, Ma said the KMT will have to fight an uphill battle to win
the presidential election, with many challenges that the party needs
to tackle, including an adjustment of the mentality of party members,
a rebuilding of the Taiwan public's confidence in the KMT, and the
handling of the KMT assets issue.</P>
      <P>During his whirlwind, one day visit in Geneva, Ma met with Geneva
officials for talks on bilateral cooperation and exchanged views with
specialists in the World Economic Forum on a wide range of topics.</P>
      <P>Ma departed Geneva for London Thursday evening to continue his
current five-nation European tour, which has taken him to Tulin,
Italy and will also take him to Ireland and Belgium.</P>

      <P>Su instructed that Minister without Portfolio Lin Si-yao gather
all related authorities to meet to work out measures to upgrade the
security and efficiency of the airport.</P>
      <P>According to local media reports, a passenger slipped through a
customs inspection counter at the airport on Feb. 5 and walked away
quickly from the scene, in disregard of an order by a customs
official for him to stop for inspection.</P>
      <P>The customs official later chased after the passenger to the exit
and requested a police officer on duty to help intercept him, but the
police officer replied that he was not supposed to leave his post and
allowed the man to run away, the reports said.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office Minister Cheng Wen-tsang pointed

      <P>For example, Cheng said, the director of the airport, who is

    <TEXT>
      <P>Many things need to be taken into account
in choosing an ideal state public prosecutor general, and President
Chen Shui-bian has yet to make a final decision on the matter, an
Executive Yuan spokesman said Friday.</P>
      <P>Cheng Wen-chang, minister of the Government Information Office,
made the remarks after news reports said that Tseng Yung-fu, chief
persecutor of the State Public Persecutor General's Office;
Prosecutor Huang Shih-ming; and Public Prosecutor Chief Hsieh
Wen-ting, are widely seen as the leading candidates to serve as the
next state public prosecutor general, succeeding Wu Ying-chao, who
has offered to resign to take responsibility for alleged widespread
vote-buying in the Dec. 3 local elections.</P>
      <P>Under the revised Court Organic law which recently cleared the
legislature, the president nominates a state public prosecutor
general, and the nomination must be confirmed by the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>President Chen, while meeting with Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng earlier this week, said that he will formally nominate a
state public prosecutor general at the end of this month.</P>
      <P>Expressing the hope that the new state public prosecutor general
will live up to the public's expectations, the Prosecutor Association
recently asked local prosecutors to select their ideal state public
prosecutor general. In the survey, Huang, Hsieh and Tseng ranked as
the top three selections, in that order.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that "reputation, professionalism, experience and
integrity" should all be taken into consideration in choosing
the ideal state public prosecutor general, adding that the ability to
promote judicial reform is another consideration. He further said
that the person chosen should also be accepted and respected by
society and those in the prosecutorial system.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRANSPORT MINISTER HAS NEW PLANS TO ENHANCE TAIWAN TOURISM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Newly sworn in Minister of Transportation
and Communications Kuo Yao-chi offered what she described as "four
pursuit" strategies Friday to help drum up Taiwan's tourism industry.</P>
      <P>To rev up tourism, the country needs to adopt four approaches --
seeking long-term planning strategy, sorting out Taiwan's uniqueness,
finding out about collective marketing strategies and pursuing a
higher global perspective -- Kuo said in a speech delivered during a
celebration to mark the beginning of Taiwan's Tourism Festival 2006.</P>
      <P>Kuo said she has been told by people that they miss Taiwan after
having been away from the island, appreciating its convenience and
cordiality, tasty food and fun around the clock.</P>
      <P>This is Taiwan's potential for developing tourism, according to
Kuo.</P>
      <P>She said Taiwan must seek long-term planning strategies to
sharpen the competitiveness of its tourism resources, pointing out
that Taiwan's natural tourism resources are by no means inferior to
those of South Korea, Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong, although the
numbers of tourist arrivals in those places have far exceeded the
numbers visiting Taiwan over the past decade.</P>
      <P>She said Taiwan must find its uniqueness from the point of view
of tourism and use it as a marketing enticement to attract tourists.
There are many things that reflect Taiwan's uniqueness, including
Taipei 101 -- the tallest building in the world, the Lalu Hotel by
the beautiful Sun Moon Lake, and Taiwan's biological diversity, which
is academically recognized as one of the richest in the world.</P>
      <P>Taiwan must work out collective marketing strategies to bolster
its tourism development, Kuo said, adding that esprit de corps is the
key to allowing the tourism industry to flourish. Citing the
rehabilitation of cities and townships that were ravaged by the 921
earthquake in 1999 as an example, Kuo said that tourism areas that
have noticeably recovered economically were areas where store or
hotel owners and operators were more willing to share resources or
cooperate among themselves.</P>
      <P>To pursue a higher global perspective, Kuo said, Taiwan must
begin from the basics, such as bringing the hospitality of the Taiwan
people into full play and making the country's entire tourism
industry an English-friendly environment.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that in 2005, the number of tourist arrivals hit a
record 3,378,000, a figure that is targeted to top 3,750,000 this
year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) released the results of a survey Friday showing that 70 percent
of the Valentine's Day gifts sold in the Taiwan market come with
excessive packaging.</P>
      <P>A total of 450 packaged gifts sold at 69 counters in five
department stores were sampled for the survey, which found that most
of the over-packaging was in the form of elaborate oversized
cushioning, too many layers of packaging, or boxes many times larger
than the gifts themselves, EPA officials said.</P>
      <P>Of 250 processed food products surveyed, less than 20 percent
passed the inspection, while of the 200 cosmetics products surveyed,
approximately 50 percent passed the inspection, the officials said.</P>
      <P>They noted that the EPA will from July 1 impose the first phase
of controls on the packaging of products, with the items to be
covered including pastries, cosmetics, liquor and computer software.
The second phase will start July 1, 2007 and will include processed
food, they added.</P>
      <P>After the measures are put into force, sellers who over-package
their products will face fines of up to NT$150,000 (US$4,650) , they
said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The pro-independence opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) plans to invite media celebrities to represent
the party in the year-end Taipei City Council elections, a TSU
official and legislator said Friday.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-ming, TSU secretary-general, noted that the party has
five councilors in the Kaohsiung City Council but none at all in the
Taipei City Council.</P>
      <P>In the hope of changing this, the TSU is planning to invite
popular TV and radio commentators Chou Yoh-kow, Chen Li-hung, Huang
Guang-chin and others to represent the TSU, Lo said.</P>
      <P>He said the TSU was inspired by the success of Japanese Prime
Minister Junichiro Koizumi and his celebrity "assassin" candidates in
Japan's snap election of 2005, claiming that Taipei residents are
more likely to accept media celebrities than real city administrators
to run the nation's capital.</P>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui, the so-called "spiritual leader"
of the five-year-old party, thinks that it is a good idea and the
plan is going ahead, Lo added.</P>
      <P>As for the party's candidate for Taipei mayor, Lo said media
personalities will again be the party's top choice and that it is
still assessing whether to ask Wang Pen-hu, the controversial host of
a TV program, to represent the party in the mayoral election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN PEOPLE ARE MASTERS OF COUNTRY: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 10 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that
as head of state directly elected by the Taiwan people, he will do
his utmost to protect their full right to choose the lifestyle they
want.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during a meeting at the Presidential Office
with the winners of the "Golden Roots Award."</P>
      <P>Claiming that the Taiwan people will not accept the "eventual
unification" theory aired by main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, Chen said the country will never tread its old
path after having come such a long way in striving for freedom and
democracy.</P>
      <P>The people are the masters of this country and they have the
right to determine its future, Chen said. Any pro-unification
conclusion or prerequisite goes against the basic principle of public
mandate in a democracy, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>The people of Taiwan are entitled to enjoy freedom of speech,
association and religion, and this is the sharpest difference between
Taiwan and China, whose 1.3 billion people are deprived of such
rights under an inhumane, undemocratic and authoritarian rule, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>A military report recently published by the Pentagon has said
that U.S. policy in terms of peace and security in the Asia-Pacific
region focuses on encouraging China to opt for a path of peaceful
economic development and political liberalization to replace its
military threats and intimidation, he said. He added that it also
pointed out that China's military buildup since the mid-1990s has led
to a military imbalance across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>An undemocratic China seeking military expansion poses a serious
threat to the Taiwan people's rights to opt for democracy, human
rights and freedom, and in contrast to democratic Taiwan, China
represents the biggest challenge to peace and security in the region,
he said, adding that it is an issue worthy of attention by all
peace-loving nations.</P>
      <P>As the leader directly elected by the people, the president said
that it is his obligation to protect every right of the people to
choose their own lifestyles and political system and that this is the
key point that differentiates the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
from the KMT.</P>
      <P>Chen also insisted that his "active management, effective
opening" China investment policy unveiled in his New Year's Day
address is not meant to get rid of Taiwan's links with China but
rather to preserve Taiwan's identity and prevent the country from
being sidelined in the international community.</P>
      <P>Taiwan must grab its own lifeline of economic development and
domestic enterprises should not tie up all their assets in China, as
China is by no means the sole or the last outlet for Taiwan
businesses, he said.</P>

study municipal administration and explore trade and investment
opportunities for Taiwan's capital city.</P>
      <P>On the first four days of his stay, Ma is scheduled to be

the president and professors of Cambridge University, visit
architecture on both banks of the River Thames and the city's urban
renewal projects, as well as inspect the city's mass transportation

      <P>Next week, the mayor, who doubles as chairman of the main
opposition Kuomintang, will visit the headquarters of Think London --
the official inward investment agency for London that provides free,
confidential and comprehensive advice to help international
businesses set up and succeed in the city. Taipei County Magistrate
Chou Chi-wei will accompany Ma on the visit.</P>
      <P>Ma will also meet with the chief executive officer of Standard

    <HEADLINE>FIRST SHIPMENT OF U.S. BEEF SINCE BAN LIFTING TO ARRIVE SATURDAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After a hiatus of nearly eight months, the
first shipment of more than 7,000 kg of U.S. beef is expected to
arrive in Taiwan Saturday and will hit the market next week at the
earliest, Taipei Customs Office said Friday.</P>
      <P>Customs officials noted that the beef will first have to pass
examinations by the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and
Quarantine under the Council of Agriculture and by the Bureau of
Standards, Metrology and Inspection under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs.</P>
      <P>U.S. beef is popular in Taiwan, but after the discovery of a
single case of mad cow disease in Washington State in December 2003,
Taiwan banned imports of U.S. beef and related produce.</P>
      <P>The ban was lifted in April 2005, but imposed again three months
later due to the discovery of a second case of mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>Following the lead of some other Asian countries, the Department
of Health quietly lifted the ban again Jan. 25. The move drew strong
criticism as it came after Japan halted U.S. beef imports again in
mid-December in the wake of the discovery of banned spinal bones in a
shipment of American veal.</P>

      <P>A new sexual harassment law has taken
effect in Taiwan this week, providing increased protection to victims
who are sexually harassed in offices, institutions and other public
places.</P>
      <P>Under the new law, those who commit sexual harassment, conduct
provocative behavior or make sexual solicitation to others in public
places, including offices, institutions, parks, public transportation
systems, malls and military barracks, will be subject to punishment
including fines and jail terms.</P>
      <P>Those who violate the law -- ranging from the telling of dirty
jokes to forcible kissing and molestation -- could be subject to
fines of between NT$10,000 (US$312) and NT$100,000 or jail terms of
up to two years.</P>
      <P>People found guilty of other provocative behavior, such as
seductive touching, lifting of skirts, displaying pornographic
pictures or sending pornographic e-mail, will also be subject to
punishment.</P>
      <P>In companies or public offices, violators who take advantage of
positions of authority to harass subordinates could face fines of up
to NT$150,000.</P>
      <P>Company owners will also be bound by law to help police with
their enquiries into sexual harassment committed by their employees
-- even outside the workplace -- and will be held legally responsible
for disciplinary action against an employee found guilty of sexual
harassment.</P>
      <P>Welcoming the implementation of the new law, Judge Kao Feng-hsien
of the Taiwan High Court said the law is aimed at building Taiwan
into an environment where both genders show respect to each other.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Legislator Joanna Lei said it is a socially

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 10 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairman of the opposition People First
Party (PFP) is still a Taipei mayoral hopeful who might surge ahead
in future polls, a PFP legislative whip claimed Friday, despite
findings by a newspaper survey that he is lagging behind a candidate
from the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) in approval ratings.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a poll conducted by the United Daily
News Feb. 8-9, 18 percent of the 1,037 Taipei residents interviewed
said they would vote for PFP Chairman James Soong, while 32 percent
said they would vote for Hau Lung-bin, the former chief of the
Environmental Protection Administration who recently left the tiny
opposition New Party to join the KMT.</P>
      <P>However, Soong fared better than another KMT candidate -- Taipei
Deputy Mayor Yeh Chin-chuan, who received a support rate of 11
percent in the survey. Soong was also ahead of the 8 percent each for
two other KMT hopefuls -- Legislator John Chiang and former Taipei
Deputy Mayor Ou Chin-der, who has not formally announced his mayoral
bid.</P>
      <P>Lin Hui-kuan, a whip of the PFP legislative caucus, expressed
confidence that Soong, who he described as having leadership,
diligence and the ability to canvass for support from house to house,
will run a successful election campaign and see his approval ratings
surge.</P>
      <P>He said that if Soong becomes Taipei mayor, he will be able to
help not only the residents of Taipei further uplift their living
standards, but will also be able to help KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
win the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Soong has kept open the possibility of running for Taipei mayor
in the year-end election, although he has not formally announced his
candidacy. He has indicated that he will discuss the matter with the
KMT chairman before making a decision.</P>
      <P>The PFP and the KMT are partners in the "pan blue alliance." Many
supporters of the alliance fear that Soong's participation in the
mayoral race might cause division within the "pan-blue alliance."
This mentality was reflected in the United Daily News poll, which
showed that 67 percent of the respondents would prefer that Soong
refrain from running.</P>

      <P>The government will carry out a census of
farmers and workers in the agricultural, forestry, fishery and animal
husbandry industries March 1-April 25, the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) announced Friday.</P>
      <P>Three short films were released along with the announcement to

agricultural resources, production structure, characteristics of
manpower and working conditions, DGBAS Minister Hsu Jan-yau said.</P>
      <P>It is part of governmental measures aimed at promoting
agricultural development that were formed to lower the impact on the
domestic agricultural industry caused by Taiwan's entry into the

global competition, Hsu noted.</P>
      <P>To seek cooperation with agricultural businesses around the
country, the agency has invited Tuo Hsien, an

      <P>China is deliberately dragging its feet in
allowing Chinese residents to come to Taiwan as tourists, a Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) official said Friday.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Huang Wei-fang said that consultation with the

Taiwan late last year.</P>
      <P>Chinese National Tourism Administration Director Shao Qiwei, at
the head of a 66-member delegation of provincial tourism officials,
reporters and industry executives, arrived in Taiwan Oct.28 for a
10-day visit to view Taiwan's tourist sites and facilities.</P>
      <P>But Shao's proposal for cross-strait consultation on tourism has

      <P>Huang noted that since the partial opening to Chinese tourists
in January 2002, the number of such tourists has exceeded 87,000.</P>
      <P>The government has asked the Travel Agent Association of the

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu expressed Friday
her hope that tour operators in central Taiwan would cooperate with
one another in an effort to develop the region's tourism industry.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, she expressed the wish that tourism would develop in
the region with emphasis on productivity, sustainability and
ecological protection in order to help boost Taiwan's international
image in the field of tourism.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks at a chairmanship changeover ceremony of a
Nantou County tourism alliance at a hotel in the central county's Sun
Moon Lake resort.</P>
      <P>In her address, Lu suggested that efforts be made to develop Sun
Moon Lake -- one of Taiwan's most popular tourist spots -- into an
Asian honeymoon village, while saying that Chunghsing Village -- the
seat of the largely marginalized Taiwan Provincial Government --
would be an ideal center for industries such as biotechnology and
health-care products, as well as for Taiwan's non-governmental
organizations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei Fine Arts Museum (TFAM) is
holding an exhibition that reflects the pressure local artists
endured when Taiwan was under Japan's colonial rule from 1895 to
1945.</P>
      <P>The exhibition is a retrospect of the Taiwanese art during the
New Culture Movement in the Japanese era. It features a wide range of
artistic works including calligraphy, sculptures, Chinese and western
style paintings. The show last till Mar. 26.</P>
      <P>Shih Miming, the TFAM associate researcher, said this exhibition
will allow people to understand Taiwanese beaux-arts from a different
angle, and understand the artists' feelings and their difficulties
when they were not free to express themselves.</P>
      <P>Japan's colonial policy had a great influence over Taiwanese
artists at that time, and the title of the exhibition, "Bamboo in the
Stormy Night", suggests the artists may bend but not break.</P>
      <P>One of the rare chance for Taiwanese artists at that time to win
recognition from their Japanese master was to excel themselves in
arts and prove them of same caliber as their Japanese counterparts,
and this exhibition is an opportunity to show that, added TFAM
director Huang Tsai-lang.</P>

      <P>United Airlines is continuing to find
promising prospects in the Taiwan market after developing the Asian
and Pacific markets for 20 years, high-ranking officials of the
airline said Friday.</P>
      <P>Mark Russel, managing director of United Airlines for south of
the Pacific, and Andrea Wu, general manager of United Airlines'

      <P>Russel noted that the Asian and Pacific routes have been one of

percent of its total business.</P>
      <P>Currently, routes from Taipei to American cities via Tokyo or
Nagoya perform particularly well and are filled to capacity during
important festivals, Russel added.</P>
      <P>Over the last two years, the United Airlines opened several new
routes to Asian Pacific countries, with the Shanghai-Chicago route
inaugurated in October 2004, and flights commencing between Ho Chi

    <HEADLINE>DIGITAL PUBLISHING SUCCESS LIES IN RESPECT FOR COPYRIGHT: PUBLISHERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 10 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The success of digital publishing requires
respect for copyright by the public, the development of a "killer
application" and the cooperation of government, enterprises and
academia, publishers said Friday on the sidelines of the Taipei
International Book Exhibition (TIBE).</P>
      <P>"Obviously, digital publishing is a future trend that every
country is working on at the moment, " said Felix Chu, president of
Transmission Books &amp; Microinfo Co., Ltd., a company that focuses on
digital publications.</P>
      <P>"The success of digital publishing ultimately lies in the
public's respect for copyright, " Chu said. "With the technology
nowadays, you can duplicate and distribute anything in the blink of
an eye. Piracy can hurt any business related to digital content."</P>
      <P>For digital publishing to be successful, people also have to
change the misconception that they can get any information for free,
Chu said. "Although well-known portal Web sites such as Google and
Yahoo are trying to provide as much free digital content on the
Internet as possible, they still have to deal with the copyright
issue. Someday you have to pay for information you need, " Chu said.</P>
      <P>Asked about the future for hard copy publications, he said:
"Paper format will be there forever, as some people still love the
feel of holding a book in their hands, " said Yvonne
Huang, marketing specialist of ANiceBook Company.</P>
      <P>"But we are exploring all the possibilities of digital
publishing. If we can cut the cost of digital publishing, which is
still pretty high right now, I believe the future will be bright.
Paper and digital formats will co-exist harmoniously, " Huang said.</P>
      <P>The most common file format used by digital publishing now is the
PDF format, while the reading software and devices vary. "When a
'killer app' does come out and a more efficient file format is agreed
upon globally, it will take the digital publishing business by
storm," Chu predicted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's digital publishing, however, "did not ride on the back
of the booming success of Taiwan's information technology, " Chu
said. He urged the government to provide more help for small- and
medium-sized enterprises in the digital publishing field.</P>
      <P>TIBE, an annual book exhibition, is held at the Taipei World
Trade Center. It will close Sunday after a six-day run.</P>

      <P>The four legislators, whip David Huang, Ho Min-hao, George Liu,

      <P>The open letter reiterated that Taiwan has been "an independent,
sovereign country, and not a part of China." It stressed the people
of Taiwan's right to self-determination, and said that it was the
right of Taiwan's people to decide whether to abolish the council and
guidelines.</P>

announcement last November that "Taiwan's democratization is
praiseworthy" and that"the Taiwan issue must be resolved by peaceful

    <HEADLINE>SHADOW OF CULTURAL REVOLUTION STILL LINGERS OVER TIBET AFTER 40 YEARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 10 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chinese government hasn't eased up in
its oppression of Tibet 40 years after the ravage of the Cultural
Revolution, Chinese writer Wang Lixiong said Friday at a book launch
in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Wang is well-known for his books "Yellow Peril, " which is one of
the best-selling books in the Chinese-speaking world but banned in
China, and "Sky Burial: The Fate of Tibet, " which is about Tibetan
culture.</P>
      <P>"Forty years after [the cultural revolution], a shadow remains
over Tibet. And the Chinese government hasn't restrained its control
and oppression of Tibet, putting a lot of limitations on Tibetans,"
said the controversial writer who was briefly arrested in the early
1990s.</P>
      <P>Wang's wife Woeser is a perfect example. Woeser, one of the few
women Tibetan writers who writes in Chinese, lost her job as an
editor after publishing a book in which she praised the Tibetan
spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama.</P>
      <P>The book launch featured three books by Woeser. One of the books,
"Forbidden Memory: Tibet During the Cultural Revolution," includes
almost three hundred pictures never before published. The photographs
were taken by her father, a Chinese military officer in Tibet during
the cultural revolution.</P>
      <P>"Looking at those pictures brought back a lot of memories and
made me pretty emotional," said Tsegyam, Representative of the Tibet
Religious Foundation of His Holiness The Dalai Lama. The foundation
is the de facto office in Taiwan of the Government of Tibet in Exile,
which is led by the Dalai Lama.</P>
      <P>"Aside from numerous deaths, the greatest harm the cultural
revolution has brought to the Tibetans is its destruction of the
spirit and religious beliefs of Tibet," said Tsegyam, who
experienced the cultural revolution as a little boy and years later
fled from Tibet to India. "The revolution may have ended
30 years ago, but the suffering within the Tibetan culture is not
over yet."</P>
      <P>"Let's not forget what China's president Hu Jintao did in Tibet.
He won the approval of his seniors and became the designated leader
of the Chinese Communist Party because of what he did there," said
political analyst Yang Hsien-hong, referring to Hu's political
crackdown in early 1989 on Tibetan activists when he was Party
Committee Secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region.</P>
      <P>The Tibet issue will not be solved before there is a democractic,
autonomous and free China, Wang Lixiong said. "If we don't have a
democractic and highly autonomous China, how are we supposed to
believe China will respect human rights and autonomy in Tibet?"</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA) is planning a Taiwan electronics product show in
Bangkok in July to help domestic companies tap the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) market, a spokesman for the
semi-official trade promotion organization said Friday.</P>
      <P>The aim of "TAITRONICS Bangkok 2006" is to help Taiwan companies
jockey for position in the ASEAN markets in view of a predictable
drastic change to be brought about after the "ASEAN plus One" and the
"ASEAN plus Three" trade blocs in the region begin to operate, the
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>He added that the ASEAN member states plan to take the lead in
removing customs duties on 11 industries that include electronic
goods, e-commerce and automobiles in 2007.</P>
      <P>According to the TAITRA official, TAITRA decided to co-sponsor
the fair with various Taiwan-based trade and industrial associations
in Bangkok due to the Thai capital's central location in the region.
Thailand has become the most popular investment target among foreign
investors compared to the other ASEAN member states, and it maintains
free trade agreements with 32 countries, he noted.</P>
      <P>At present, there are some 5,000 Taiwan companies with operations
in Thailand, with investments totaling over US$10 billion. Taiwan is
Thailand's third-largest foreign investor behind only Japan and the
United States.</P>
      <P>Two-way Taiwan-Thailand trade hits around US$6 billion per year,
with trade in electronics products and computer-related business
growing steadily every year, the TAITRA official said.</P>
      <P>Since 2001, Taiwan's exports of information industry and
electronics goods to Thailand increased at an annual average rate of
more than 30 percent, he added, pointing out, however, that market
share enjoyed by Taiwan businesses is still low there.</P>
      <P>The official urged Taiwan companies hoping to break into the Thai
market to take part in the fair, as the event has gained strong
support from the Thai authorities.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will
normalize Taiwan's exchanges with China if the party regains power in
2008, KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said in London Friday.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during a live online broadcast of the Chinese
Service of the BBC, the British public broadcasting system, while
fielding questions from Web users around the world.</P>
      <P>He said that at present, the conditions do not exist for Taiwan's
unification with China because of the vast differences between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The two sides need to set up the necessary mechanisms, normalize
their exchanges, increase mutual understanding, wait for all
conditions to mature and then leave it to the people on both sides to
determine whether they want unification, Ma said.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the matter should not be left simply to the
leaders of Taiwan and China to decide.</P>
      <P>The KMT chairman, who also serves as Taipei mayor, said his party
would not rule out the possibility of discussing the unification
issue with Beijing, but will not be committed to any timetable for
Taiwan's unification with China.</P>
      <P>There is still much room for China's improvement and development
in order to narrow its gap with Taiwan. For example, China must first
become a democratic society with equitable wealth distribution for
its people and its government must respect civic rights, he said.</P>
      <P>Asked about President Chen Shui-bian's recent proposal to scrap
the National Unification Council and National Unification Guidelines,
Ma said Chen was probably trying to test the waters in order to see
the reaction of the outside world.</P>
      <P>Ma said the president could also be trying to use the issue to
divert the public's attention from a series of problems in his
administration, including the involvement of senior government
officials in corruption scandals.</P>

White House Knew of Levee's Failure on Night of
Storm 

U.S. Congressional investigators have
learned that an eyewitness account of the New
Orleans flooding from a a federal emergency
official reached the Homeland Security
Department's headquarters in the night of Aug.
29 last year when Hurricane Katrin struck the
coastal region of Mexico Gulf, and the White
House was informed at midnight. In the
aftermath, the Bush administration officials
said they had been caught by surprise when they
were told on Tuesday, Aug. 30, that a levee had
broken, allowing floodwaters to engulf New
Orleans. Michael D. Brown, who was the director 
of FEMA until he resigned under pressure on
Sept. 12, said in a telephone interview Thursday
that he personally notified the White House of
this news that night, though he declined to
identify the official he spoke to.

Wall Street Journal: Planned Economy,
As China's Trade Clout Grows,
So Do Price-Fixing Accusations

Chinese manufacturers currently supply more 
than 85 percent of the vitamin C used in the
U.S. Just like the oil cartel, they can heavily
influence world prices. After a 2001 agreement
among China's four largest producers, spot
prices for vitamin C rose to as high as US$9 a
kilogram from lows of less than US$3. As China
becomes ever more dominant in manufacturing,
its ability to dictate the prices of industrial
and consumer products is steadily rising. As a
result, Chinese manufacturers are increasingly
running afoul of Western antitrust law in
products from vitamin C to a mineral used in
steel production. These legal struggles could
become another point of tension in the
U.S.-China relationship, which has been tested
by disagreements over matters from textile
tariffs to the trade deficit.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung Port in central Taiwan handled
fewer containers and less cargo last year, according to port
statistics.</P>
      <P>Taichung Port loaded and unloaded a total of 88.429 million tons
of cargo in 2005, down by 0.52 percent from the 2004 level, or a
reduction of 472,374 tons of cargo, the figures showed. The port
handled more than 1.22 million twenty-foot containers last year,
marking a 1.31 percent decrease year on year.</P>
      <P>Port officials attributed the decrease to fierce competition from
ports in neighboring countries and areas, and to the overall economic
climate. They also said the Taichung Harbor Bureau has come up with
concrete measures to attract a larger number of business investments
in the port, which has a sophisticated infrastructure and a traffic
network linking adjacent areas.</P>
      <P>Measures being mulled include offering flexible and reduced rates
for shipping companies willing to operate in Taichung Port and
encouraging investment in the port's infrastructural facilities, the
officials said, noting that contracted investment is estimated at
over NT$9 billion for the coming year.</P>
      <P>The bureau is planning to fully develop a free trade zone inside
the port, encouraging businesses to open shop and luring greater
foreign investment, the officials said, adding that it is also
promoting e-operating systems in the zone and throughout the port,
developments of which are slated to complete in December this year.</P>
      <P>In addition, they pointed out, new wharves are being built and
dredging is underway to provide ships with better services and
safety.</P>
      <P>Taichung Port is the largest in central Taiwan and the country's

      <P>"This is the first children's book for which I've done both
writing and illustrations," the 45-year-old Nocke told CNA during an
interview Friday.</P>
      <P>Nocke has long supported children's organizations in his
country. He often donates the copyrights to his illustrations to
these organizations so they can sell them to finance their projects.</P>
      <P>"I chose a penguin as the main character because I think it's an
animal with human connotation," Nocke said.</P>
      <P>"Fipps, the little brightly colored penguin, was born in a cold
and grey world where all the other penguins do the same thing every
day," said Fipps' creator. "This one wants to be different, but
he's helplessly trapped in his environment. One day, he seizes the
chance to escape, and discovers a new world."</P>
      <P>Nocke said the character of Fipps is caught in a situation much
like that of most children in the modern world -- they are pushed to
learn but rarely given the chance to create and be inspired.</P>
      <P>"Children are urged to be successful, but how do you define
success?" the author asked.</P>
      <P>Fifteen original illustrations from the book are currently being
shown at the German Cultural Center (Deutsches Kulturzentrum) located
at Ho-Ping West Road. The exhibition lasts until Feb. 15 and the
illustrations will then be transferred to "BeFineArt Gallery" on
Jen-Ai Road from Feb. 16 until the end of March.</P>
      <P>Nocke works in cooperation with "BeFineArt Gallery" and has
visited Taiwan several times before the launch of this book.</P>
      <P>He entered design school in Germany at the age of 16, and studied
painting in Vienna, Austria, at the age of 19 with Ernst Fuchs, a
surrealist artist.</P>

    <HEADLINE>IDEA TO SCRAP NUC IN REVIEW PROCESS BY PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  11 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office is expected to
finish a review process by the end of this month concerning the fate
of a number of non-institutional bodies, including the National
Unification Council (NUC), officials said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The move was made in reaction to a resolution passed by the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan requesting that some
non-institutional bodies set up under the Presidential Office be
dissolved. Those named by the legislature are the preparatory group
for the national human rights memorial museum, the gender
mainstreaming advisory panel, the science and technology advisory
committee, the constitutional re-engineering office and the youth
corps.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office officials noted that President Chen Shui-bian
has instructed secretary-general Tan Sun Chen to work out a solution
that takes into consideration both the legal and political aspects of
the issue.</P>
      <P>Although the legislature has not asked for the dismantling of the
NUC, the Presidential Office is inclined to include the organization
in the review process because it is also a non-institutional body,
they said.</P>
      <P>But they stressed the Presidential Office will need to study the
matter thoroughly, in light of the possible political impact it
involves.</P>
      <P>Chen first proposed in a Lunar New Year's Day speech Jan. 29 that
Taiwan should seriously consider scrapping the NUC and National
Unification Guidelines -- two items symbolic of the country's
objective of unifying with China, which were established by the
former Kuomintang (KMT) government.</P>
      <P>The proposal has raised concerns in Washington, with U.S. State
Department officials reiterating that the United States does not
support Taiwan independence and opposes unilateral changes to the
cross-Taiwan Strait status quo by either Taiwan or China.</P>
      <P>It has also invited much media speculation as to whether the
proposal violates Chen's "five noes, " pledges he made in his
inaugural speeches of 2000 and 2004.</P>
      <P>On this issue, ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
officials pointed out that the "five noes" -- including the pledge
not to declare Taiwan independence and not to abolish the NUC and its
guidelines -- were based on the precondition that Beijing renounce
its intention of using force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>China's continuous move to build up its military power indicates
it has the intention and ability and has even prepared to invade
Taiwan, they noted.</P>
      <P>They said the president's plan stressed the democratic value that
"the people of Taiwan have the right to determine their own fate" and
was aimed at clarifying the mainstream public opinion in Taiwan to
Beijing and the international community.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou has said that unifying both sides of
the Taiwan Strait remains the party's ultimate goal.</P>
      <P>The remarks have drawn much criticism from the DPP, which
believes that any change to the status quo in Taiwan should be
decided by its people through a referendum.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC WARNS AGAINST TECHNOLOGICAL FLOW TO CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's China policy planner reaffirmed
Saturday the necessity to step up management on China-bound
investment to protect Taiwan's hard-earned technological know-how
from flowing to China. </P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu made the
remarks during an interview with a local TV station.</P>
      <P>Quoting information from national security units, Wu said Chinese
President Hu Jintao, during a visit to Fujian last month, asked
Taiwan investors to introduce a new agricultural strain and a new
agricultural technology to the southeastern Chinese province each
month to accelerate the region's economic development.</P>
      <P>"This approach would completely destroy Taiwan's agriculture, "
Wu said.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan is at the cutting edge in several key
agricultural technologies, something of which the people of Taiwan are
very proud, but he pointed out that the fruit of years of labor has
fallen into the hands of China, due to increased exchanges between
the two sides in recent years.</P>
      <P>The exodus of some of Taiwan's key technologies -- such as
special techniques for cultivating butterfly orchids or distinctive
types of fruit -- has undermined Taiwan's efforts to make inroads
into the Chinese market, Wu said. Taiwan will also face unfair
competition from Chinese products that have been developed through
the use of Taiwan's technology, or by simply misleading consumers
into thinking they're buying Taiwan-made products.</P>
      <P>Wu reaffirmed the policy of "active management and effective
opening," which President Chen Shui-bian advocated in his New Year's
address, adding that from the government's perspective the approach
should help protect Taiwanese businessmen from the risks involved in
investing in China.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan has extended many olive branches to Beijing
and there were cross-strait issues that needed further consultation,
but Beijing has so far turned a deaf ear.</P>
      <P>Because of China's many internal difficulties, the government
will have to make a careful assessment of Taiwan's investment in
China, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's official figures estimate investment in China totalling
US$50 billion, he said, but figures compiled by the semi-official
Straits Exchange Foundation indicate the figure of US$150 billion,
and private credit organizations place the number at US$280 billion,
showing that "nearly 70 percent of Taiwan's capital has flowed to
China through illegal channels."</P>
      <P>He also said that media reports show an increase in the number of
Taiwanese business owners stranded in China after losing all their
money.</P>
      <P>Profits of China-based Taiwan businesses have declined by 30
percent over the past three years, while those losing money have
exceeded 50 percent, he added.</P>
      <P>In light of the situation, Wu urged Taiwan investors to think
globally, and to consider diversifying their investments in places
such as India, Vietnam and Mexico.</P>

    <HEADLINE>UNIFICATION GUIDELINES `LIKE FROZEN FOOD': VICE PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  11  (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Echoing a proposal by President Chen
Shui-bian to consider abolishing the National Unification Guidelines,
Vice President Annette Lu said Saturday that the guidelines'
objective of establishing "a unified China enjoying freedom, wealth,
equality and prosperity" has become outdated.</P>
      <P>Lu likened the guidelines, which were adopted in 1990 by the
former Kuomintang government, to frozen food.</P>
      <P>"The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is only checking if the
food has begun to stink after being frozen in the refrigerator for so
many years," Lu said while giving a speech at a trade union gathering
in Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>In response to local media criticism that the DPP government may
have infuriated Washington by putting forth the proposal, Lu asserted
that Taiwan must not allow others to dictate what it should or should
not do, because "it is not a state of the United States, nor is it a
province of China."</P>
      <P>"We have our own position on this issue. People should not treat
the National Unification Guidelines as if it were an imperial
decree," she said.</P>
      <P>In a speech given on Jan. 29 Lunar New Year's Day, Chen proposed
that Taiwan should seriously consider scrapping the National
Unification Council and National Unification Guidelines, seeking to
join the United Nations under the name of Taiwan, and should draft a
new constitution by the end of this year to be put for a referendum
in 2007.</P>
      <P>Washington officials have reacted to the proposals by reiterating
that the United States does not support Taiwan independence, and
that it opposes any unilateral changes to the status quo by either
Taiwan or China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHOULD ADOPT EU'S METHODS TO ATTRACT HI-TECH EXPERTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  11 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should learn form some European
Union countries in attracting high-tech experts through issuing
special visas to researchers and doctoral students from non-EU
countries, Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD)
officials said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The officials made the remarks after the Cabinet-level
organization's recent report discussed strategies used by European
universities to deal with transitions into a knowledge-based economy,
in which the CEPD detailed EU countries' methods for maintaining
competitiveness while enhancing employment opportunities.</P>
      <P>To broaden the horizons of European universities, officials noted
that several EU countries issue special working visas for non-EU
researchers, and encourage foreign students to purse doctoral studies
there.</P>
      <P>In addition, European countries are actively promoting scientific
and industrial parks to encourage cooperation between corporations
and universities.</P>
      <P>European universities are also encouraged to participate in
district development projects in order to strengthen their R&amp;D and
teaching capabilities, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>To enrich university coffers, EU states are promoting private
donations, encouraging schools to sell their knowledge-based
services, and allowing students, public agencies and corporations set
up a transparent monitoring mechanism.</P>
      <P>Due to the shortage of employment opportunities, the ratio of R&amp;D
researchers in EU enterprises only accounts for 50 percent of its
total workforce, much lower than 83 percent in the United States and
66 percent in Japan, they said.</P>
      <P>As for European researchers, one third will be retiring in 10
years, according to the report.</P>
      <P>To attract more R&amp;D talent, European countries are working to
increase the number of women researchers, strengthening exchanges
between academics and corporations, as well as offering financial aid
to those interested in pursuing advanced studies.</P>
      <P>Through these measures, EU countries are getting close to
becoming the "knowledge bank" of the world by 2010, the officials
said, urging the government to emulate the EU's example and to create
a university system on par with the best in the world.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIR POLLUTION TO WORSEN WHEN MASSIVE FIREWORKS SET OFF IN YENSHUI FESTIVAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  11 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In the countdown before the Yenshui
fireworks festival, environmental officials cautioned Saturday those
who suffer from asthma or allergies to avoid visiting the small town
in southern county of Tainan this Sunday when massive fireworks will
set off there to celebrate the traditional Lantern Festival.</P>
      <P>Citing the Environmental Protection Administration's (EPA) air
quality report on Yenshui in February 2004 when the "only in Taiwan"
annual festival kicked off, officials said the density of air
particulate matter (PM) in the town skyrocketed past the daily
maximum of 125 micrograms.</P>
      <P>At the festival's peak -- between 9: 00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. -- PM
density was recorded at 326.5mg per square meter, according to the
report.</P>
      <P>Since PM smaller than 10 micrometers (100 times thinner than a
human hair) can reach the lungs and cause respiratory problems, the
EPA warned asthma patients, or senior citizens and children with weak
resistance to disease to stay away from the fireworks festival.</P>
      <P>EPA officials also reminded festival visitors to equip themselves
with surgical masks such as the medical-grade "N95" mask, because
debris can pass through normal gauze masks. The good news, they said,
was that the air pollution caused by the fireworks will disperse
faster in the open streets.</P>
      <P>On the 15th day of the first Lunar month, local and foreign
tourists swarm into Yenshui to watch literally millions of fireworks
-- particularly bottle rockets -- being fired at wooden statues of
local deities seated in small palanquins, or sedan chairs. This year
the festival falls on Feb. 12.</P>

(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics currently drive the Taiwan-India
relationship and that is the way it should be, an Indian scholar said
Saturday on the sidelines of the founding ceremony of the
Taiwan-India Cooperation Council (TICC).</P>
      <P>"The relationship between Taiwan and India will primarily be
[based on] economics. The economics will drive our relationship for
now, and that's how it should be, " said Arun Sahgal, deputy director
of Research and Head of the Center for Strategic Studies and
Simulation of the United Service Institution of India, and a retired
Indian brigadier.</P>
      <P>"Through enhanced bilateral ties, we hope that eventually it will
lead to more Taiwanese investment in India," he said.</P>
      <P>And as a developing country, India can learn from Taiwan's
experience, said Sahgal, who attended the ceremony on his second
visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked about the relationship between Taiwan, India and China,
Sahgal said: "We don't want to bring Taiwan into a balance of power
[between India and China] issue."</P>
      <P>"We're trying to improve bilateral ties with China and have been
making progress. But we also have disputes with China, such as energy
resources, that have not been settled. As for the future of India and
China, I will describe it as 'constructive co-existence.'"</P>
      <P>Is it possible for Taiwan and India to establish a strategic
partnership and military cooperation in the future?</P>
      <P>"We'll see, " Sahgal replied.</P>
      <P>The newly established TICC is aimed at strengthening economic,
trade, legislative, artistic and cultural relations between Taiwan
and India. Yu Shyi-kun, chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) , was elected chairman of the Board of Directors of the
new private association at its first board meeting held Saturday

    <HEADLINE>TICC TO HELP TAIWAN BOOST COOPERATION WITH INDIA</HEADLINE>

(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is ready to boost its cooperation
with India on all fronts with the help of the Taiwan-India
Cooperation Council (TICC), the chairman of the new organization said
Saturday. </P>
      <P>"The TICC is aimed at strengthening economic, trade,
parliamentary, artistic and cultural ties between Taiwan and India,"
TICC Chairman Yu Shyi-kun said at the private association's inaugural
ceremony.</P>
      <P>"Establishing the new council also complements the government's
'Go South' policy. Taiwan and India share a common focus as 'India's
looking east and Taiwan's going south, '" said Yu, who concurrently
serves as chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) .</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Arun Sahgal, deputy director of
Research and head of the Centre for Strategic Studies and Simulation
of the United Service Institution of India, said India is now seeking
a closer engagement with East Asia and attaches great importantance
to its ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Both sides will benefit from the enhanced cooperation, Sahgal
said. Sahgal also believes India has great advantages for attracting
Taiwanese investors because of the size of its labor force, lower
production costs and enormous market potential.</P>
      <P>The development of Taiwan-India relations has attained a rapid
and steady growth, as bilateral trade reached US$1.93 billion in
2004, five times higher than 1990 figures, Yu said. Also, the number
of Indian engineers in Taiwan has reached over a thousand.
Parliamentary visits and direct flights between both sides have
steadily increased in recent years.</P>
      <P>"India is seen as having the most potential among the four golden
'BRIC' (Brazil, Russia, India and China) countries," Yu said.</P>
      <P>Besides Taiwan and India's collaboration on software and
hardware, India's overall economic strength will provide even more
opportunities for Taiwan-India economic and trade cooperation, he
noted.</P>
      <P>Yu came up with the idea to set up a Taiwan-India association
after Taiwan Thinktank organized a seminar on "India-Japan-Taiwan
Trialogue" in Taipei in November 2004 when Yu was still Taiwan's
premier.</P>
      <P>Information technology and infrastructural development are two
sectors Taiwan and India could work on together, and India will serve
as an important springboard for Taiwanese business to extend its
market to Europe, former Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh
said at the TICC inaugural ceremony.</P>

(By Debby Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman
Yu Shyi-kun said Saturday that President Chen Shui-bian's Lunar New
Year's Day proposal to consider abolishing the National Unification
Council and National Unification Guidelines is in line with the DPP's
ideals.</P>
      <P>"[The DPP's] party charter and its Resolution on Taiwan's Future
both stressed that Taiwan is an independent, sovereign nation, and
that sovereignty belongs to the 23 million people of Taiwan," Yu said
during an interview with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>"The National Unification Guidelines presumes unification is the
only option for Taiwan's future, but when the guidelines are
abolished it will become one of the many options, " Yu said, adding
that it has always been one of the DPP's objectives.</P>
      <P>Yu said the DPP always considers Taiwan's sovereignty as
something that belongs to all the people in Taiwan. Unification, like
independence, is one of the options for Taiwan's future, Yu said,
adding that the DPP wants to ensure that the Taiwanese people have
the right to decide their own future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>UNIFICATION GUIDELINES RESEMBLE CHINA'S ANTI-SECESSION LAW: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Unification Guidelines as
formulated under the former Kuomintang administration need to be
reviewed as they resemble a Chinese law enacted last March, Taiwan's
China policy planner said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Joseph Wu, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), made
the remarks in an interview with a local television station in the
wake of U.S. concerns over President Chen Shui-bian's recent proposal
that Taiwan seriously consider scrapping the National Unification
Council (MUC) and National Unification Guidelines and that Taiwan
apply to join the United Nations under the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He noted that the National Unification Guidelines, which set a
three-stage plan for stepping up exchanges with China with the goal
of eventual unification, "bears substantial resemblance" to the
Anti-secession Law Beijing enacted in March 2005, which provided a
legal basis for the use of force against Taiwan should it move toward
formal independence.</P>
      <P>If the guidelines are preserved, Wu said "this could easily
result in great misunderstanding throughout the international
community."</P>
      <P>The government will continue to communicate with the U.S. over
its concern, Wu said, adding that "the scrapping of the National
Unification Guidelines is to defend the present freedom and democracy
in Taiwan and the opportunity of Taiwan people to decide their own
future in free will," Wu said.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan has continued to communicate with the United
States with some positive results.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan hopes that the U.S. will realize the necessity of 
establishing a systematic channel of communication between
leaders of the two countries," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the NUC and the National Unification Guidelines were
established by the KMT in 1990, Wu said that a single political party
should not decide the future of Taiwan and that its future lies with
the 23 million people on the island.</P>
      <P>Wu dismissed reports that President George W. Bush was "furious"
over Chen's remarks and that Bush might chide Chen in front of
Chinese President Hu Jintao when the latter visits Washington in
April, although U.S. think tanks and academics have discussed similar
possibilities.</P>
      <P>To understand the official response of the U.S., Wu said, 
statements of the U.S. State Department should be carefully
monitored, adding that the U.S. has continued to reaffirm its
cross-strait policy based on the "One China" policy, the Taiwan
Relations Act and the three communiques, and that the Taiwan issue
should not be resolved by no other than peaceful means.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Feb.  11 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh unveiled
during a lecture Friday his plan of conducting short-term research on
the subject of symbiosis at Harvard University in the United States.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that when the "pan-green camp, " led by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , controls more than half of the
legislature there would be a better chance he could put into practice
his theories on symbiosis on mutual benefits and cooperation among
different political and ethnic groups.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's political arena has been plagued by a hostile standoff
between the "pan-green camp" and the opposition "pan-blue alliance"
of the Kuomintang and the People First Party since the DPP took power
in May 2000.</P>
      <P>Hsieh stepped down from the premiership in January after the
opposition-controlled legislature boycotted nearly all major policy
initiatives of his Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that in his view, symbiosis was an essential, "core
value" in political development, adding he will continue to carry out
his intensive research on the theory, while seeking its profound
meaning and interpretation.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  11 (CNA)
(By Debby Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Yu
Shyi-kun said Saturday that the United States is indeed frustrated by
Taiwan's long dealy in striking a bilateral arms deal, and that under
the circumstances it was "only natural" that the U.S. to show
impatience.</P>
      <P>Taiwan media reported Saturday that Dennis Wilder, the U.S.
National Security Council's acting senior director for Asia, had said
if Taiwan did not show determination in its self-defense, the U.S.
may lose interest in Taiwan after six months.</P>
      <P>"It is only natural that the U.S. would show impatience because
they are trying to help us improve our defense, " Yu said during an
interview with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan has blocked the
budget bill for the DPP administration's plan to purchase eight
diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PAC III anti-missile
batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C submarine-hunting aircraft from
the United States for nearly two years.</P>
      <P>In the past, Yu said, when the United States did not want to sell
arms to Taiwan, Taiwan took issue with the United States; now, the
United States wants to sell Taiwan weapons but Taiwan does not want
them, so it was natural for the United States to be impatient.</P>
      <P>Yu accused opposition leaders of attempting to curry favors with
Chinese leaders by blocking the arms deal, claiming that such an
approach would do a great disservice to Taiwan's security and
interests.</P>
      <P>He then again urged the main opposition Kuomintang and its
"pan-blue alliance" ally, the People First Party, to stop their
boycott against the arms package in order to protect the people of
Taiwan.</P>

      <P>A total of 5.96 percent of Taiwan
households bought residences in 2005, the highest percentage in the
last seven years, according to a survey released Saturday by Sinyi
Realty.</P>
      <P>The ratio was up 0.14 percentage points over the previous year
and marked the fourth consecutive positive-growth rate since 2002 --
the first time the home-buying rate experienced an upward trend
following a 10-year recession in Taiwan's real estate industry.</P>
      <P>By region, the number of homes purchased in 2005 was the highest
in Taichung City, where approximately one in 10 families purchased a
home that year. Hsinchu County posted the second-highest rate,
followed by Taoyuan County and Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Penghu County had the lowest home-buying ratio in 2005, with only
1.57 percent of households purchasing homes that year.</P>
      <P>Analysts at the real estate company said Taiwan's
economic recovery and mortgage loans provided at low rates by the
government have helped boost people's desire to buy a home, which they
said was reflected in the increase in turnover in the real estate

      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT) should be"prudent"and
"careful"when dealing with potential membership applications from
people in China, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) chairman Yu
Shyi-kun said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Yu made the statement during an interview with the Central News
Agency in response to KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's remarks that he
did not reject the possibility of accepting members from China in an
interview with the BBC's Chinese news service on Friday.</P>
      <P>"[A party] should be prudent and careful when it accepts people
who are completely unrelated to Taiwan. After all, a party should seek
to pursue its country's independence and sovereignty, and its
people's welfare,"Yu said.</P>
      <P>He said if the KMT accepted members who were "unrelated to
Taiwan," there would soon be KMT branches in Shanghai, Beijing and
other cities in China.</P>
      <P>Yu stressed the DPP would only accept members who were of Taiwan
nationality or members who formerly held Taiwanese citizenship.</P>
      <P>Yu also criticized Ma's recent statement regarding unification
and Taiwan's future. He said the DPP proposed independence for
Taiwan, but it needed to be ratified in a referendum by the people of
Taiwan, while it was unclear whom Ma believed could decide Taiwan's
future.</P>
      <P>"Ma says people in Taiwan can decide Taiwan's future, but can
the people in China decide that, too? Is he leaving out something
important when he speaks? We are still not clear about what he means,
"Yu said. Yu said Ma's words were not as clear as the DPP's.</P>
      <P>Yu said the DPP's greatest enemy was itself, not Ma, and that Ma
was not something to be feared. He said the DPP was highly
idealistic, democratic, pluralistic, open, uncorrupt and a
reform-oriented party. He said that as soon as the DPP could get its
fundamental values back, it would continue to win public support.</P>

      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) said
Saturday it would help farmers tap into more stable markets and
that it is currently planning to make inroads into the Middle East.</P>
      <P>COA officials said they have recently targeted Dubai, the
business hub of the Middle East, noted for its location at the
crossroads of Europe, Asia and Africa, with a population of
high-income wage earners.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese flowers received a very warm reception at an
agricultural exhibition recently in Dubai, they said, while Dubai
businesses have shown a keen interest in Taiwan fruit.</P>
      <P>COA officials noted China's vast yet unstable market, adding that
Taiwan's fruit has sold well in China since Beijing granted a
zero-tariff treatment for 15 types of Taiwanese crops -- coconut,
betel nut, pineapple, guava, mango, pomelo, papaya, peach, plum,
custard, wax apple, starfruit, date, persimmon, and loquat -- on
Aug.1, 2005.</P>
      <P>COA statistics showed that between August and November, sales of
these 15 Taiwanese fruits in China totaled US$641,156, an 11-fold
increase over the US$53,407 recorded during the same period last
year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan fruit sales continued peaking in popularity during Lunar
New Year holiday in Beijing and Shanghai, but in some regions Taiwan
fruit sales did not meet expectations after the initial novelty
subsided.</P>
      <P>With China's rising market instability, COA officials said they
have become more cautious lest local farmers suffer losses due to
rapid changes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ENVIRONMENTAL MISERY INDEX UP IN TAIWAN: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 11 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 37 percent of respondents to a
recent survey said that Taiwan's environment has been deteriorating in
the past five years, Environmental Quality Protection Foundation
officials said Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to the foundation's telephone survey conducted at the
end of January, Taiwan's environmental misery index, which dropped
slightly in 2000, rose significantly last year to 70.06.</P>
      <P>The survey's 1,097 respondents were asked their views on 20
environmental issues, including water pollution, air pollution,
sustainability and environmental policies.</P>
      <P>Liu Ming-lung, secretary-general of the Environmental Quality
Protection Foundation, noted that poor water and land conservation,
which has been followed by frequent landslides, water shortages and
typhoon-damaged, muddy reservoirs, is the greatest source of
environmental concern for the people.</P>
      <P>The respondents also expressed dissatisfaction with the poor
performance of the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) in
cutting the use of plastic bags at restaurants and shops around
the country, household sewage management and water contamination.</P>
      <P>Nearly 60 percent of respondents believed the EPA had failed
in its policy to limit the use of plastic bags, with only 18
percent of those surveyed saying the policy was successful.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 64 percent agreed that cellphone base stations should
retreat from residential districts for public health reasons, with
only 23 percent of those surveyed opposing it.</P>
      <P>After several cases of dioxin poisoning occurred in Taiwan,
more than 80 percent of respondents agreed that the government
should set up a policy to monitor dioxin contamination and to
ensure food safety.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PARTY-GOVERNMENT CONSENSUS-BUILDING MECHANISM TO KICK OFF: DPP CHAIR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 11 (CNA)
(By Debby Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman
Yu Shyi-kun said Saturday that a party-government policy coordination
mechanism will soon be in place that will allow staffers from the
Presidential Office, the Executive Yuan, the DPP, the DPP legislative
caucus, and the National Security Council to discuss major policy
initiatives before they are implemented.</P>
      <P>Yu said President Chen Shui-bian fully supports the move.</P>
      <P>"We are doing some studies on the mechanism, and it will kick off
some time. The mechanism will be normalized and systematized. It will
achieve the functions of communication and coordination. The
interactions between the Presidential Office, the Executive Yuan and
the party will become closer," Yu said.</P>
      <P>Yu said DPP Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung will convene
closed-door weekly meetings based on the mechanism, and policy
staffers from the Presidential Office, the Executive Yuan, the DPP,
and DPP legislative caucus, and National Security Council will meet
and discuss major policies and their implementation timetable.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yu said the DPP will hold debates on its China
policies. He said the debates are a reflection of the DPP's
democratic, open and pluralistic values, and they will allay doubts
that the DPP only tolerates one line of thinking.</P>
      <P>"If from the debates, the party comes up with a conclusion that
is different from the President's original policy, I believe the
President will listen to the party, and the conclusion will become an
important reference in the President's future decision-making, "Yu
said.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The first shipment of more than 7,000
kilograms of U.S. beef in nearly eight months arrived in Taiwan
Saturday and is expected to hit the market next week at the earliest.</P>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Hou Sheng-mao and several
animal health officials traveled to Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport to look into customs inspection operations.</P>
      <P>Customs clearance completed at 7: 55 p.m. Before the U.S. beef
hits the market, the produce has to pass examinations by the Bureau
of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine under the
Council of Agriculture and by the Bureau of Standards, Metrology and
Inspection under the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>It will take two to three days to complete examinations. If the
examination results show the beef meets all health regulations, Hou
said, the DOH will allow the produce to enter the market.</P>
      <P>Hou said the DOH will make every possible effort to ensure food
safety and protect consumer's health.</P>
      <P>U.S. beef is popular in Taiwan, but after the discovery of a
single case of mad cow disease in Washington State in December
2003, Taiwan banned imports of U.S. beef and related produce.</P>
      <P>The ban was lifted in April 2005, but imposed again three months
later due to the discovery of a second case of mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>Following the lead of some other Asian countries, the DOH quietly
lifted the ban again Jan. 25. The move drew strong criticism as it
came after Japan halted U.S. beef imports again in mid-December in
the wake of the discovery of banned spinal bones in a shipment of
American veal.</P>
      <P>According to the DOH regulations, only trade in U.S. boneless
beef from animals under 30 months of age is resumed.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States has named Stephen Young,
a career diplomat with experience in Taiwan and China affairs, as its
new representative in Taipei, the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
announced Saturday.</P>
      <P>Young, a former U.S. ambassador to Kyrgyzstan, has been appointed
director of the AIT Taipei Office, the institute said in a news
release.</P>
      <P>Young is scheduled to arrive in Taipei in March to assume his new
post, the AIT news statement said. Young succeeds Douglas Paal, who
returned to the United States last month after completing his
three-and-a-half-year term in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>AIT is a quasi-official U.S. liaison office authorized to handle
relations with Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties. The
United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing
in 1979, but still maintains close substantive ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Young lived in the southern Taiwan port city of Kaohsiung for two
years along with his family during his childhood. He later twice
worked at AIT, including his tenure as the deputy head of the AIT
Taipei Office from 1998 through 2001. His overseas assignments also
included posts in Moscow and Beijing. His most recent overseas
assignment was as ambassador to Kyrgyzstan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Raymond Burghardt, who formerly served as U.S.
ambassador to Vietnam and now works at the East-West Center in
Hawaii, will be appointed new chairman of the AIT, filling the post
left vacant by Therese Shaheen's resignation in April 2004.</P>
      <P>U.S. State Department officials recently confirmed that Burghardt

    <HEADLINE>NUC VIOLATES DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE BY SETTING ULTIMATE GOAL: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 12 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Unification Council (NUC) and
National Unification Guidelines set Taiwan's unification with China
as an ultimate goal in violation of the democratic principle, a
senior China affairs official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Huang Wei-feng, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) , said the ultimate goal that was set when Taiwan was a
one-party state also runs counter to Taiwan's mainstream opinion and
therefore calls for a review.</P>
      <P>Huang was responding to the controversy sparked by President Chen
Shui-bian's proposal to "seriously consider" abolishing the NUC and
the guidelines, a controversy that has reverberated both at home and
overseas -- across the Taiwan Strait in China and across the Pacific
in the United States.</P>
      <P>The MAC official made the remarks at a press conference held to
release the results of a survey by the Institute for National Policy
Research. The survey by the private think tank found that 51 percent
of those polled disagree with the NUC's ultimate goal, 68 percent
support the idea of discussing whether or not to do away with the NUC
and the guidelines, and 78 percent think Taiwan's future should be
decided by the people of Taiwan alone.</P>
      <P>Huang said that since 2000, President Chen's China policy has
always been aimed at cross-strait peace and stability, a policy to
which China has responded with increased military deployment aimed at
attacking Taiwan and with what it calls its "Anti-Secession Law"
legalizing its plan to use force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Both its military and legislative actions have destabilized
cross-strait relations, and Taipei must face the stern reality that
the status quo across the strait is changing, he added.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the survey results show that an absolute
majority of the people in Taiwan think that any change to the
relations between Taiwan and China must have their support and that
any political party's unilateral decision about Taiwan's future
stands on the opposite side of the absolute majority view.</P>
      <P>Huang criticized certain people who have used the word "populism"
to show their contempt for popular views, claiming that such an
attitude dates back to Taiwan's authoritarian era and so can no
longer survive in Taiwan's democratized society.</P>
      <P>He called on all political parties in Taiwan to "listen to the
voices of the people" and hold a rational debate about all issues
between Taiwan and China in order not to "mislead China into making a
wrong judgment about Taiwan's mainstream opinion, " thereby causing
harm to Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ABOLISHING UNIFICATION GUIDELINES WOULDN'T ALTER STATUS QUO: DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) legislative caucus supports scrapping the National Unification
Guidelines, and the status quo across the Taiwan Strait would by no
means be affected by such an abolishment, a DPP legislative party
whip said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yi-jin, convener of the DPP caucus at the Legislative Yuan,
said that the DPP caucus will throw its support behind the notion of
abolishing the National Unification Council (NUC) and the National
Unification Guidelines so long as the National Security Council puts
forth such a suggestion to President Chen Shui-bian for approval.</P>
      <P>Yeh made the remarks in response to news reports that President
Chen has instructed the National Security Council and Presidential
Office Secretary-General Tan Sun Chen to study whether to include the
abolishment of the NUC and the National Unification Guidelines into a
plan to downsize the administrative structure of the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>The NUC, established by the former Kuomintang government in the
early 1990s, has been an unofficial agency under the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>The National Security Council and the president's aides are
expected to come up with a plan before the end of February to
eliminate ad hoc commissions under the Presidential Office in line
with a Legislative Yuan resolution.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that President Chen will fully inform Washington
before the National Security Council submits the plan to him for

      <P>News reports have said that President Chen's proposal to consider
dissolving the NUC and the National Unification Guidelines -- made in
a speech that he gave on Lunar New Year's Day Jan. 29 -- has
irritated Washington.</P>
      <P>In that speech, the president said Taiwan should seriously
consider scrapping the NUC and National Unification Guidelines and
seeking to join the United Nations under the name of Taiwan and
should draft a new constitution by the end of this year to pave the
way for a referendum in 2007.</P>
      <P>Washington officials have reacted to the proposals by reiterating

    <HEADLINE>'NO REMOVAL OF MISSILES, NO TALKS' IS TAIWAN MAINSTREAM OPINION: KMT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The notion that there should be no talks
with China if it does not remove its missiles aimed at Taiwan is the
mainstream opinion in Taiwan concerning the development of
cross-strait relations, a member of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
legislative caucus said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chin-lung, a KMT deputy party whip at the Legislative Yuan,
said that no people in the world would be willing to live under the
threat of missiles, and Beijing has no chance of forcing Taiwan to
return to the negotiating table with the threat of missiles.</P>
      <P>If China intends to see ultimate unification across the Taiwan
Strait, Tsai said, it should give careful thought to how to win the
hearts and minds of the Taiwan people, instead of aiming missiles at
Taiwan while at the same time making "goodwill" overtures toward the
island.</P>
      <P>Tsai was responding to KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's remarks made
during a discussion with Taiwan students at Cambridge University in
England Saturday. When a student asked Ma whether Taiwan should
shelve cross-strait negotiations until Beijing removes the missiles,
Ma answered that he "completely agrees" with the notion.</P>
      <P>Tsai claimed that the idea of peaceful unification with China has
been the mainstream opinion in Taiwan. If Beijing insists on
continuing to deploy missiles targeting Taiwan, this will only serve
to defy the common aspiration of the Taiwan people, he said.</P>
      <P>Showing genuine goodwill to the people of Taiwan to win their
hearts is the only right way for Beijing to seek peaceful unification
with Taiwan, Tsai stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NATIONAL UNIFICATION COUNCIL A SAFETY VALVE IN CROSS-STRAIT TIES: KMT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  12 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) said Sunday that the National Unification Council
(NUC) and the National Unification Guidelines serve as a safety valve
in the often tense relations between Taiwan and China, warning that
doing away with these nominal institutions might trigger a war
between the two.</P>
      <P>As Chen's statement that it's time to "seriously consider"
scrapping the NUC and its guidelines has sparked a controversy, the
KMT caucus advised him to take heed of his political credibility and
put aside his agenda to abolish the NUC, focusing his energy instead
on revitalizing the nation's economy.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chin-lung, caucus deputy secretary general, claimed that
scrapping the NUC and its guidelines "absolutely contradicts" Chen's
own "five noes" pledge of not declaring Taiwan independence, not
changing the nation's official title, not pushing for inclusion into
the Constitution of the "state-to-state" description of cross-strait
relations, not holding a referendum on independence versus
unification, and not abolishing the NUC. Chen made the "five noes"
pledge in his inauguration addresses in 2000 and 2004.</P>
      <P>"If the president insists on pushing ahead with his proposal to
abolish the NUC, then his political credibility will again be open to
doubt," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>On the president's argument that he was proposing abrogating the
NUC in deference to a Legislative Yuan resolution to do away with all
illegal organizations under the Presidential Office, Tsai said if the
issue flares up again at the legislature, it could be seen
internationally as an attempt by the Chen administration to tilt
toward independence.</P>
      <P>That would be enough to meet a condition in China's
"Anti-Secession Law" for launching a military attack against Taiwan,
thus bringing the island under the shadow of war, he added, asking:
"Why should President Chen take pains to strike a raw nerve in
cross-strait relations?"</P>
      <P>Even if the president wants to do away with the NUC in accordance
with the legislative resolution, he should come up with more thorough
reasons to convince the people, rather than just doing whatever he
wants, Tsai said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH VIGILANT AS FIRST SHIPMENT OF U.S. BEEF ARRIVES SINCE BAN LIFTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) is on full
alert for suspicious meat imports after the first shipment of more
than 7,000 kilograms of U.S. beef in nearly eight months arrived in
Taiwan Saturday.</P>
      <P>To demonstrate the DOH's vigilance, Health Minister Hou Sheng-mou
headed to Chiang Kai-shek International Airport Saturday to oversee
in person customs inspection operations for the arriving U.S. beef.</P>
      <P>The 7,000-odd kilograms of beef is expected to hit the market
next week at the earliest. The beef must first pass inspections by
the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine under
the Council of Agriculture and by the Bureau of Standards, Metrology
and Inspection under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, which will
take at least two to three days to complete.</P>
      <P>Hou said the DOH will make every possible effort to ensure food
safety and protect consumer's health.</P>
      <P>U.S. beef is popular in Taiwan, but after the discovery of a
single case of mad cow disease in Washington State in December 2003,
Taiwan banned imports of U.S. beef and related produce.</P>
      <P>The ban was lifted in April 2005 but then re-imposed three months
later due to the discovery of a second case of mad cow disease in
the United States.</P>
      <P>Following the lead of some other Asian countries, the DOH quietly
lifted the ban again Jan. 25. The move drew strong criticism as it
came after Japan halted U.S. beef imports again in mid-December in
the wake of the discovery of banned spinal bones in a shipment of
American veal.</P>
      <P>According to the DOH regulations, only trade in U.S. boneless
beef from animals under 30 months of age has been resumed.</P>
      <P>In addition to stepped-up inspections by the government, mega
malls and discount franchises are now required to display U.S. beef
on specially-zoned shelves, while restaurants are required to clearly
indicate to customers that they are serving U.S. beef, said Hsiao
Tung-ming, director of the DOH Bureau of Food Safety.</P>
      <P>Larger shipments of U.S. beef are expected to begin arriving in
Taiwan by sea in about one month's time, Hsiao said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  17 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>For the sake of executive-legislative
harmony, the Executive Yuan plans to appoint National Communications
Commission (NCC) members if the Council of Grand Justices does not
hand down a ruling on the controversial new agency prior to Friday,
officials disclosed Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan requested the grand justices to hand down a
"temporary decision" to freeze the establishment of the NCC, before
former premier Frank Hsieh stepped down last month, on the grounds
that the NCC Organic Law has damaged the nation's constitutional
system by allowing the legislature to infringe upon the power of the
executive branch of government.</P>
      <P>The Council of Grand Justices, which handles constitutional
disputes, has agreed to tackle the case, saying it will make a ruling
by Feb. 17 on whether the NCC should be frozen.</P>
      <P>If the Council has not come up with a decision by that time, the
officials said, the Executive Yuan under Premier Su Tseng-chang will
on that day appoint the 12 members of the NCC approved by the
legislature. The goodwill gesture is aimed at creating harmony with
the legislature which will go into a new session on Feb. 21, they
noted.</P>
      <P>A 13th member of the NCC has yet to win the legislature's
approval before the premier can appoint him or her.</P>
      <P>Officials acknowledged that there is a risk in appointing NCC
members before a Council of Grand Justices ruling since the newly
launched NCC has the power to veto a Government Information Office
decision with regard to media licenses or permits.</P>
      <P>If the grand justices were to rule that the NCC Organic Law is
unconstitutional, they added, an argument could arise about whether
NCC decisions are constitutional, they said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLARS DEFEND CHEN'S REMARKS ABOUT SCRAPPING NUC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  12  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of government officials and
scholars defended Sunday President Chen Shui-bian's recent remarks
about scrapping the National Unification Council (NUC) and its
guidelines, saying that the government should adjust its China policy
in view of major changes in the cross-Taiwan Strait situation.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Beijing has already gone against the
precondition of Taiwan's "five noes" policy by enacting the
Anti-Secession Law, in mid-March last year, they argued that the
president's Jan. 29 remarks were made in response to the current
cross-strait situation due to China's failure to drop its intentions
to use military force against Taiwan and to its intensified united
front offensive aimed at the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Minister Huang Wei-feng,
Tamkang University professor Chao Chun-shan, National Taiwan
University professor Chen Ming-tung, and Academia Sinica researchers
Lin Cheng-i and Hsu Yung-ming were among those who attended a meeting
during which they released the results of a recent public opinion
poll on President Chen's remarks about considering to scrap the NUC
and its guidelines.</P>
      <P>Huang urged the public to pay attention to the fact that the
prerequisite of Taiwan's "five noes" policy is that Beijing must
renounce the use of force against Taiwan. However, Beijing has failed
to do so and has enacted an Anti-Secession Law aimed at Taiwan, he
pointed out, adding that Taiwan is entitled to review its stance to
tackle the changing cross-strait situation.</P>
      <P>In a democracy like Taiwan, the people have the right to hold
open debates about major national policies, and this is the reason
why the president made the comments to make people better understand
the present situation facing Taiwan, Huang said. To some extent, Chen
made the remarks to respond to Beijing's Anti-Secession Law, he
noted.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
should examine its policy in the face of drastic changes affecting
the country. Issues related to Beijing's Anti-Secession Law, visits
to China by the opposition Kuomintang and the People First Party
chairmen, Taiwan's farm exports to China, and China's plan to give
Taiwan two pandas as a gift have all added to worsening the
cross-strait situation, he claimed.</P>
      <P>Lin asserted that Taiwan's future must be decided by the Taiwan
people and that the ceremonial NUC has no say in this matter,
expressing his worry that Taiwan would be seriously hit should China
and the United States work together to deal with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, Chao questioned the timing of President Chen's remarks
on dissolving the NUC.</P>
      <P>Chao voiced the hope that candidates of the pro-unification "pan
blue alliance" and the independence-minded "pan green camp" will
raise their respective visions about Taiwan's future prior to the
2008 presidential election. He also urged the ruling DPP to clarify
its stance regarding scrapping the NUC in its open China policy
debates in March.</P>
      <P>Hsu predicted that cross-strait issues will dominate Taiwan's
political arena in the coming two years, adding that he believes that
the "pan blue alliance" will shift away from promoting unification to
opposing independence while the "pan green camp" will shift away from
advocating independence to opposing unification.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than half of the Taiwan people do not
support the unification goal envisioned in the National Unification
Guidelines, while a vast majority are opposed to Beijing's
Anti-Secession Law, according to the results of a recent poll.</P>
      <P>In the poll conducted from Feb. 8-10 by the Institute for
National Policy Research among people aged between 20 and 69, nearly
63 percent of the respondents said they had never heard of the
National Unification Council (NUC) and its guidelines, in contrast to
33 percent who said that they had heard of their establishment.</P>
      <P>Some 51 percent of the respondents said they are opposed to
Taiwan's eventual unification goal with China laid out in the
National Unification Guidelines, well ahead of the 24 percent who
voiced support. Nearly 68 percent agreed with the proposal of
reviewing the need to keep the guidelines in place, while 10.6
percent said that they are opposed to the idea.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 44 percent said that they would be worried about
Beijing's reaction if the Taiwan government really did want to
abolish the NUC and its guidelines, while almost 40 percent said they
would not be concerned at all. Similarly, 38 percent said that they
would not be concerned about Washington's response, while 48 percent
claimed that they would.</P>
      <P>In the same survey, 78 percent contended that "Taiwan's future
must be determined by its 23 million people, " while only 7 percent
said they do not think so. Some 72 percent said that they are against
Beijing's Anti-Secession Law aimed at stemming Taiwan's moves toward
independence, while only 4.9 percent voiced support for it.</P>
      <P>Regarding the question of whether China's military expansion has
caused a threat to Taiwan and other neighboring countries, almost 49
percent said they agree with the notion, ahead of 32 percent who said
"no."</P>
      <P>As to the future relations between Taiwan and China, 60.9 percent
said they favor maintaining the status quo, 13.1 percent said they
favor unification, 17.2 percent said they are leaning toward
independence, and 9 percent said that they have no idea on the
matter.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian proposed in his Chinese New Year's Day
speech Jan. 29 that Taiwan should seriously consider scrapping the
National Unification Council and its guidelines, which serve as the
policy frame for Taiwan's unification with China, in response to
Beijing's failure to renounce the use of military force against
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen's words stirred up concerns in the United States and China.</P>
      <P>Washington reiterated its stance of opposing any unilaterally
changes to the cross-strait status quo by either Taiwan or China,
while Beijing said that it will deal with Taiwan on the basis of the
"four points" statement issued by Chinese President Hu Jintao a year
ago which focuses on its "one China" principle and peaceful
unification.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI BOOK EXHIBITION ENDS SIX-DAY RUN WITH RECORD 440,000 VISITORSBy S.C. ChangCNA Staff Writer</HEADLINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P> The 14th Taipei International Book Exhibition (TIBE) came to a
close Sunday with a record 440,000 visitors during its six-day run,
as the organizer claimed a new direction has taken shape in which the
TIBE's three functions -- international exchanges, professional
publishing, and reading as part of life -- will support and
strengthen one another.</P>
      <P>Hao Ming-yi, chairman of the Taipei Book Fair Foundation, said
the event invited four European countries for the first time to show
off their cultures at a thematic hall, a try-out that he had worried
might create some confusion but turned out to be very successful as
books and other cultural products from Germany, France, Poland and
Greece were seen as samples of diversity and vitality.</P>
      <P>Claudia Kaiser, director of the International Department of
Frankfurt International Book Fair which organized the four-country
joint exhibit, said participants from Poland and Greece were at first
quite concerned because they knew nothing about joining such an event
in Taiwan. Now they say they've seen a lot in Taipei, she continued,
adding that she plans to invite more European countries to join the
Taipei event next year.</P>
      <P>Responses to other overseas participants was enthusiastic,
according to Hao, who cited for example that all of the books
displayed by the ASEAN Book Publishers Association, also a first-time
participant in the exhibition, were purchased by the National
Library.</P>
      <P>Hao said the surprising volume of sales not only boosted ASEAN
publishers' interest in returning next year, it also demonstrated
Taiwan's strong interest in expanding exchanges with the neighboring
region.</P>
      <P>Iran's Shabaviz Publishing Co., a third time participant in the
TIBE, was also happy to report that its sales have been improving
each year at the exhibition and that it reached deals on the
copyrights for 60 books and other items at this year's event.</P>
      <P>Singapore's Pan-Asia Publishing House found Korean and Japanese
buyers of a series of Chinese language books that it plans to publish
later.</P>
      <P>The European publishers said they will come up with a list of
recommended books which they hope will be translated into four
languages -- English, Chinese, Japanese and Korean. This shows that
the TIBE has acted as a forum to serve more Asian readers, according
to Hao, who pledged to strengthen the TIBE's regional exchange
mechanism by expanding contacts with all publishers.</P>
      <P>Given the impressive attendance and sales over the past six days,
Hao said a new direction has been shaped in which the TIBE's three
major functions -- international exchanges, professional publishing,
and making reading part of life -- have worked well to reinforce one
other. A clearer path should appear three to five years down the road
for the TIBE, he predicted.</P>

      <P>Ma is scheduled to make public his so-called "2-P 3-C" theory in
a speech at the prestigious London School of Economics (LSE) Monday.</P>
      <P>He said Sunday that cross-Taiwan Strait issues are not limited to
commonly seen disputes over sovereignty, but rather cover a wide

division, controversy over independence or unification, birth places

      <P>A Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official
believes that Taiwan's cutting-edge agricultural technologies have
been exploited by China's farm sector.</P>
      <P>When asked by reporters whether Chinese mainland-based Taiwan
businesspeople have provided China with Taiwan's cutting-edge
agricultural technology, Huang Wei-feng, a MAC vice minister, said
Sunday that bell fruit developed by Pingtung farmers and known as
"black pearl" for its good taste and richness in moisture is living
proof that this is the case as the fruit has been seen around China.</P>
      <P>"How could the Chinese fruit growers have grown the tasty 'black
pearl' bell fruit without technology or seedlings offered by Taiwan
businesspeople?" Huang asked.</P>
      <P>MAC Minister Joseph Wu said the day before that there is a
necessity for Taiwan to step up management on China-bound investment
to protect Taiwan's hard-earned technological know-how from flowing
to China.</P>
      <P>Quoting information from national security units, Wu said Chinese
President Hu Jintao, during a visit to Fujian Province in January,
asked Taiwan investors to introduce a new agricultural strain and a
new agricultural technology to the southeastern Chinese province each
month to accelerate the region's economic development.</P>
      <P>"This approach would completely destroy Taiwan's agriculture, "
Wu stressed.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan is at the cutting edge in several key
agricultural technologies, something of which the people of Taiwan
are very proud, but he pointed out that the fruit of years of labor
has fallen into the hands of China, due to increased exchanges

      <P>As Ma is seen as a likely candidate in Taiwan's 2008 presidential
elections, Qiao said Ma's message will draw a lot of attention.</P>
      <P>Qiao, a political science professor in China, said when China
pushes democratization process, it will need not only domestic forces
but also "assistance from outside."</P>
      <P>Looking back at Chinese history and those of other Asian
countries, he said bloodsheds could hardly be avoided in their
pursuit of political reform.</P>
      <P>But Taiwan, a culturally Chinese society like Singapore and Hong
Kong, has moved from authoritarian to democratic governments in a
peaceful and rational manner -- a successful case among all Chinese
societies that Qiao said can also inspire other Asian countries.</P>
      <P>He said he believes Taiwan's example can be a good reference for
China, whose authoritarian political leaders have been implementing
economic liberalization policies as Taiwan had done, but are worried
that reforming politics could lead to chaos.</P>
      <P>Qiao said he will definitely attend Ma's speech and if he has a
chance to ask Ma questions, he would like to know what kind of
messages Ma will drive home to his Chinese audience if he visits
there.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT NOT OPPOSED TO MAINTAINING DEFENSE SPENDING AT 3% OF GDP: MA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  Feb.  12 (CNA)
(By Jennifer Huang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting Taipei Mayor Ma Jing-jeou said
here Sunday that the Kuomintang (KMT) is not opposed to maintaining
Taiwan's annual defense budget at three percent of the country's
gross domestic product (GDP) if government finances can support it.</P>
      <P>In an address delivered to representatives of the overseas
Taiwanese communities in England, Ma, who doubles as KMT chairman,
said that the KMT unwaveringly supports the notion that Taiwan needs
to have a sufficient self-defense capability and that the party has
demonstrated its resolve to boost this capability.</P>
      <P>However, Ma pointed out that the KMT opposes "irrational" arms
purchases. The KMT and the other two "pan-blue alliance" parties, the
New Party and the People First Party, are opposed to "money for
friendship" arms purchases and will only support "reasonable and
pragmatic" arms procurement plans, he said.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is currently on a six-day visit in London as part of his
five-nation European tour, told his audience that the KMT will
clearly make known its stance on Taiwan's arms procurement plans by
the end of February at the earliest.</P>
      <P>The KMT is also expected to put forth its reform plan for the
Control Yuan, before the end of February, he said, adding that the
plan will be aimed at manning Taiwan's top watchdog body with
professional and "less political" figures.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is viewed as a shoo-in to win the KMT nomination in the
2008 presidential election, also mentioned that the KMT will resolve
the thorny party assets issue before 2008.</P>
      <P>He added that part of the funds expected to be acquired through
liquidation of some the KMT assets will be used to expedite
retirement plans for senior KMT workers, with the aim of reducing the
party's payroll to some 600 people within two years.</P>
      <P>"Manpower" is not necessarily a guarantee for a party to win
popularity, Ma said, pointing out that the KMT, which has more than 1
million members, has only garnered 51 percent of the vote in its best
election performance. In comparison, the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) has managed to secure 42 percent of the vote
in major elections with only 300,000-odd party members.</P>
      <P>"The KMT has had 'lower productivity' than the DPP," he added.</P>
      <P>Ma said that what counts is not manpower or money, but rather
restoring the party's spirit and integrity. The KMT should strive to
win the hearts of the Taiwan people through the "Three Principles of
the People" -- nationalism, democracy and the people's well-being --
put forward by Sun Yat-sen, founder of the Republic of China and the
KMT, to build an independent, democratic and prosperous China, he
said.</P>
      <P>Ma began his six-day visit to London Feb. 10, the third leg of a
five-city European tour to study municipal administration and explore
trade and investment opportunities for Taiwan's capital city.</P>
      <P>Ma was interviewed by BBC and other media outlets in England,
talked with the president and professors of Cambridge University, and
viewed urban development on both banks of the River Thames over the
weekend.</P>
      <P>During the last three days of his London visit, Ma is scheduled
to head to the headquarters of Think London -- the official inward
investment agency for London that provides free, confidential and
comprehensive advice to help international businesses set up and
thrive in the city.</P>
      <P>He is also expected to hold closed-door meetings with various
other British officials, think tank members and pro-Taiwan
parliamentarians.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP HOPES TO RETAIN KAOHSIUNG MAYORSHIP, FIGHT FOR TAIPEI MAYORSHIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) hopes to retain its hold on the Kaohsiung mayorship and to
fight for a chance to win the Taipei mayorship in the year-end
elections, DPP officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun will meet later in the day with
directors of the DPP's Taipei and Kaohsiung chapters and discuss with
them the nomination of the party's candidates for the Taipei and
Kaohsiung mayoral and city councilor elections.</P>
      <P>The DPP will form a task force for the year-end elections and
begin an assessment of the candidates and the elections, according to
DPP officials.</P>
      <P>In contrast with the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) in Taipei
City, where several hopefuls have announced their bid to run, only
former Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung of the DPP has so far expressed
interest in running.</P>
      <P>Yu said the party will be in no hurry to nominate its candidates,
adding that the party will deal with the issue after observing the
situation of the KMT and the DPP's aspirants.</P>
      <P>However, Huang Chin-lin, director of DPP's Taipei chapter,
expressed a different view.</P>
      <P>"Shen is not capable of representing the party, " Huang claimed,
adding that only Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen is able to counter the
KMT's candidate.</P>
      <P>Huang said that he recently met with 12 administrative heads of
the DPP, and that 10 of them were in favor of Tsai.</P>
      <P>As for the Kaohsiung mayoral election, only former Council of
Labor Affairs Chairwoman Chen Chu and Legislator Kuan Bi-ling have
expressed interest in running. The party will persuade one of them to
drop out, and if that fails, then a primary will be held, according
to DPP officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAXIMUM REWARD FOR REPORTING SMUGGLED ANIMALS RAISED TO NT$5 MILLION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The maximum reward for reporting smuggled
animals or plants will be raised from NT$3.5 million (US$108,700) to
NT$5 million in a bid to safeguard Taiwan against avian influenza,
the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine under
the Council of Agriculture (COA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials said that in view of the spread of avian flu in
the world, with Italy announcing last Saturday that the virus has
appeared in the country, they have increased the rewards.</P>
      <P>Those who report smuggled animals or plants that are later found
to be carriers of the highly pathological strain of the bird flu
virus, the foot-and-mouth disease virus or rabies will receive a
reward worth 10 times the value of the smuggled animals or plants.
The minimum award will be NT$250,000, while the maximum will be NT$5
million.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that authorities seized a total of 92 tons of
smuggled livestock products and 6,888 animals last year, which they
said has effectively prevented major viruses or pests from making
inroads into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The officials urged the public to use the toll-free phone
0800-039-131 to report any cases of smuggled animals or plants.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday
welcomed the U.S. government's appointment of Stephen Young, a career
diplomat with experience in Taiwan and China affairs, as its new
representative in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Washington announced Friday that Young, a former U.S. ambassador
to Kyrgyzstan and currently a member of the Policy Planning Staff
under the State Department, will be the new director of the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Taipei Office.</P>
      <P>Young, who joined the U.S. foreign service in 1980, is expected
to arrive in Taipei in March to assume his post, replacing Douglas
Paal, who returned to the United States in January after completing a
three-and-a-half-year term in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Foreign Ministry officials said they believe that after Young
assumes his Taipei post, he will fully reflect the Bush
administration's policy toward Taiwan and will help bolster bilateral
substantive relations between Taiwan and the United States.</P>
      <P>AIT is the quasi-official U.S. liaison office authorized to
handle relations with Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic
ties. The United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei
to Beijing in 1979 but still maintains close substantive ties with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Young lived in the southern Taiwan port city of Kaohsiung between
1963 and 1965 as the child of a U.S. military officer stationed
there. He later twice worked at AIT, including tenure as the deputy
head of the AIT Taipei Office from 1998 through 2001. His overseas
assignments have also included posts in Moscow and Beijing.</P>
      <P>Foreign Ministry officials welcomed him, saying that Young, who
is acquainted with cross-Taiwan Strait relations, gave a commendable
performance in his efforts to enhance understanding and strengthen
communications between Taiwan and the United States during his stint
as deputy director of the AIT Taipei Office.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT TO USE SEVEN STANDARDS TO MONITOR GOVERNMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  13  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's)
legislative caucus said Monday it will use seven standards, including
judicial independence and social harmony, to monitor the government.</P>
      <P>The caucus said that honoring the Constitution, respecting the
legislature, administration according to the law, maintaining
administrative neutrality and governance with diligence and frugality
are the other five criteria it hopes the government will agree to
fulfill in order to better interact with the opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Caucus Secretary-General Pan Wei-kang said the standards are
nothing but common principles that all democratic parties --
especially those who claim to be progressive -- should follow.</P>
      <P>If the government does not adhere to these principles, the KMT
and other opposition parties will demand an apology from the
government or the dismissal of the officials responsible, Pan said.</P>
      <P>If the government ignores opposition demands for remedies, she
warned that the opposition will stage what she claimed a "reasonable
and peaceful" non-cooperation campaign.</P>
      <P>Pan and other caucus leaders told a press conference that if the
government fails to act in accordance with these principles and
"causes opposition boycotts" at the legislature, the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) shall be held responsible.</P>
      <P>In response to the KMT strategy, the DPP legislative caucus said
it respects the KMT action and agreed to work for ruling-opposition
harmony.</P>
      <P>However, DPP caucus whip Chen Ching-chun said the KMT should not
"just examine others without looking at itself" and he urged the KMT
to "work with the government for the benefit of the people."</P>
      <P>In another press conference, Chen called on the KMT caucus to
recall how, over the past six years, it has acted itself with regard
to its seven principles.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed that the KMT acted unconstitutionally by refusing to
exercise its obligation to approve President Chen Shui-bian's
nominations of Control Yuan members, causing disruption in the
operation of the Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>He further cited the KMT's blocking of a government special
budget bill for purchasing key weapons, a government proposal to
amend the Executive Yuan Organic Law and a Cabinet bill for setting
up an anti-corruption agency.</P>
      <P>The KMT's efforts to promote farm produce exports to China have
backfired in that the nation's agricultural technology has been
flowing into China to the detriment of Taiwan, Chen further claimed.</P>

      <P>Eighteen Korean painters have arrived in
Taipei to attend the Sino-Korean Painters' Fine Art Intercourse
Association Show, in which 65 works by artists from the two countries
are being displayed.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, which kicked off Saturday at the National Taiwan
Arts Education Center, will run through Mar. 9.</P>
      <P>The annual Sino-Korean Fine Art Intercourse show has been held

35 works from Taiwan and 30 from Korea. Most of the works are ink or

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER HAILS  KMT HEAD'S 'MISSILE TALKS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  13 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
voiced support Monday for "missile talks" by opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, saying that Taiwan and China should
discuss the issue to break the current impasse across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Should China be willing to remove its some 800 missiles aimed at
Taiwan, the Taiwan people will undoubtedly feel Beijing's good
faith, Wang said, adding that "this is an important issue that the
two sides can talk about."</P>
      <P>If some breakthroughs could be made in this field, people on both
sides of the strait could feel much assured, according to Wang.</P>
      <P>He also echoed Ma's "2P and 3C" theory, slated to be aired by the
KMT chairman in a speech to be given Monday at the London School of
Economics, praising it as a good idea that will be conducive to
boosting cross-strait exchanges and helpful in clinching a peace
accord between the two sides.</P>
      <P>According to the "2P and 3C" theory, Taiwan and China should
engage in "co-operation through conciliation" to replace
confrontation and create "co-existence and prosperity" across the
strait.</P>
      <P>The KMT chairman said Saturday during a seminar at Cambridge
University that he agrees with the idea that "Taiwan will not hold
talks with China if Beijing refuses to dismantle the missiles aimed
at Taiwan "because no one likes living under the threat of military
intimidation." The idea was proposed by a student from Taiwan on the
same occasion.</P>
      <P>The KMT chairman, who is also mayor of Taipei, is currently on a
five-nation European tour.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at the Legislative Yuan, Chen
Chin-jun, a legislative caucus whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) accused Ma of irresponsibly making
paradoxical remarks to cheat voters with an eye to the 2008
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that cross-strait relations are not built upon
slogans or one-sided wishful thinking, Chen asked Ma to shed light on
"eventual unification" remarks he made last month to foreign media.</P>
      <P>Chen accused Ma of playing a "two pronged" plot to connive with
Beijing to suppress Taiwan in the international community, and
questioned why Ma did not speak for Taiwan when Beijing enacted the
Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan in mid-March last year.</P>
      <P>Beijing has so far failed to drop its military threats against
Taiwan despite the fact that President Chen Shui-bian made the "five
noes" promises in his inauguration speeches in 2000 and 2004, he
said.</P>

    <DATELINE>London,  Feb. 13 (CNA)
(By Huang Tzu-chiang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said here Monday
that engaging in negotiations with China to seek a breakthrough in
relations remains the only way for Taiwan to solve the thorny
cross-Taiwan Strait issue peacefully.</P>
      <P>Even in the face of 700 missiles targeting Taiwan, the country's
leadership should seek to negotiate with China and solve the
differences between the two sides to achieve permanent peace across
the Taiwan Strait, said Ma, who doubles as chairman of Taiwan's main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>During an interview with Taiwanese and British reporters, Ma
recommended that Taiwan seek to break the political impasse through
what he claimed were "peace agreements" reached between former KMT
Chairman Lien Chan and Chinese President and Communist Party of China
Chairman Hu Jintao in Beijing last spring, including the
establishment of a military mutual trust mechanism across the strait.</P>
      <P>Taking the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet
Union, the two superpowers of the Cold War era, as an example, Ma
said neither side refrained from engaging in talks with the other
just because the opposite side had acquired new weapons. "In other
words, both sides of the Taiwan Strait should seek common points
between them to help defuse tension rather than trading excuses, " he
said.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, what his party calls Lien's "historic journey of
peace" to China last spring opened a door for Taiwan and the Taiwan
leadership should follow up by grasping the opportunity to start
negotiating with the Beijing leadership for the benefit of the people
on both sides of the strait.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Five major think tanks in Taiwan are making
an unprecedented joint effort to find ways of creating another
economic miracle by 2020, a think tank leader said Monday.</P>
      <P>Vincent Siew, chairman of the Chung Hua Institute for Economic
Research, said Chung Hua is working with the Taiwan Institute for
Economic Research (TIER) , Taiwan Thinktank, the Taiwan Research
Institute (TRI) and the Institute of Economics of Academia Sinica on
a multidisciplinary project called "A Study on Creating a New
Economic Boom for Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy has been in transition for more than 10 years,
with almost all manufacturers that should have moved out of the
country having moved out, although some of them have started to move
back, Siew said.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the government create a good environment for
these returning businesses, as well as those that have stayed in
Taiwan, and to make good use of resources to create a new path for
Taiwan's economic development.</P>
      <P>Siew said the Council for Economic Planning and Development has

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Grand Justices will not be
able to predict when an interpretation on the constitutionality of
the National Communications Commission (NCC) Organic Law will be
released, Judicial Yuan officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>The officials said the impact of the interpretation will be
enormous and that the grand justices need to study and discuss the
matter carefully, which is why they cannot predict when a result will
be reached.</P>
      <P>They made the remarks one day after Executive Yuan officials
expressed hope the grand justices will rule soon.</P>
      <P>In view of public feelings and a desire to create harmony between
the ruling and the opposition parties, the Executive Yuan officials
said, if the grand justices still cannot give aruling by Friday, the
Executive Yuan is prepared to complete the appointment of the NCC
members as the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan will open its
new session next Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-jun, a legislative caucus whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, said Monday that "there is a possibility" that the
Executive Yuan will appoint the NCC members Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that Premier Su Tseng-chang, right after assuming his
post late last month, expressed hope for harmony between the ruling
and opposition parties, so it is likely that he will appoint them.</P>
      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh refused to appoint the 13 NCC
commissioners as soon as the legislature confirmed the list Jan. 12
in accordance with the NCC Organic Law that took effect Nov. 9 last
year.</P>
      <P>Hsieh's Cabinet asked the Council of Grand Justices Jan. 20 to
interpret the constitutionality of the NCC Organic Law, claiming that
the law infringes upon the executive branch's constitutional power
and thus seriously damages the constitutional system. It also
requested the council to impose an injunction suspending the
establishment of the NCC pending a constitutionality ruling.</P>
      <P>The requests were made three days after Hsieh announced he would
resign along with his Cabinet Jan. 23. Hsieh formally stepped down

    <HEADLINE>KMT VICE CHAIRMAN WARNS AGAINST TAIWAN'S CHINA INVESTMENT POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Manila,   Feb.  12  (CNA)
(By Emerson Lin and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's "active
management, effective opening" China investment policy will drive
Taiwan to the sidelines of the world stage, opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang said here Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chiang made the remarks while attending a seminar with members of
the KMT's branch in Manila -- the first leg of a weeklong tour where
he arrived earlier the same day at the head of a 12-member KMT
delegation of lawmakers and thinktank members. The KMT vice chairman
will also visit Thailand and Vietnam.</P>
      <P>He warned that Taiwan companies, in particular those in the
service sector, will lose business opportunities in the Chinese
market to competitors from Europe, Japan, the United States and South
Korea if the government continues to postpone a full opening to
China.</P>
      <P>Saying that the KMT will do its best to help improve the
situation, Chiang added that Taiwan companies will encounter an even
more difficult situation after the "ASEAN Plus Three" free trade
agreement begins to operate in the near future.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's service sector stands a good chance of seizing a large
stake in the Chinese market thanks to the lack of a language barrier,
but the government of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party is
dragging down the development of Taiwan firms in China due to its
ideology, Chiang claimed.</P>
      <P>After the "ASEAN Plus Three" trade bloc takes effect, products
from the member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
and China, Japan and South Korea will enjoy zero tariff treatment
among them, a situation that will greatly affect Taiwan's
enterprises, he said.</P>
      <P>According to Chiang, former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuang
Yaw envies very much Taiwan's good location in the Taiwan Strait and
its cultural and language links with China, and commented once that
Taiwan should use these advantages to nurture its economy at a time
when the Chinese economy is growing fast.</P>
      <P>As long as Taiwan's economy remains strong, the government will
have "no difficulty making friends around the world, " Chiang said,
noting that Taiwan's economy still expanded at an annual growth rate
of 4.6 percent in 1998 after the Asian financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Over the past five years, Taiwan's dwindling economy has led to
higher jobless and suicide rates, he lamented, claiming that this is
closely related to the government's policy vacillation and political
uncertainty at home.</P>
      <P>President Chen said in his New Year's Day speech that the
government will shift to the "active management, effective opening"
policy from its past "active opening, effective management" policy to
better guide Taiwan investment in China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ABORIGINES HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS TO WIN THE HEART OF VALENTINES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Instead of giving flowers or chocolate as
Valentine's Day gifts, Taiwan indigenous people have different ways
of expressing love to the people closest to their hearts.</P>
      <P>The Amis people of eastern Taiwan have a matriarchal society.
Young tribal women take the initiative to ignite a potential love
affair by giving a home-made betel nut pouch to the man she admires
or by filling his pouch secretly with fresh betel nuts, according to
Tien Che-yi, an anthropologist and ethnologist who is also a Bunun
aborigine from the Central Mountain Range.</P>
      <P>The Puyama people of Taitung, eastern Taiwan, also have a
matriarchal society and men usually take the bride's family name.
When proposing, the two sides exchange headwear, betel nut pouches or
bunches of fresh betel nuts.</P>
      <P>The Paiwan and Rukai people, both of southern Taiwan, have strong
concepts of social class. When proposing marriage, the side taking
the initiative will prepare a full truck of betel nuts to impress the
other family and to show off the family's wealth, according to Tien.</P>
      <P>The Paiwan, in addition, are traditionally tolerant toward the
fact that the future husband or wife might have had many lovers
before marriage, and the exes are normally invited to the wedding.</P>
      <P>The Tao people of Orchid Island are one of the most romantic
tribes in Taiwan. The man and the woman will sing and dance all night
on the beach after they fall in love. If approved by the parents on
both sides, the girl then comes to live in the man's home and does
domestic chores in a "trial marriage" arrangement.</P>
      <P>The indigenous people of central or northern Taiwan usually do
not use betel nuts as a means of showing wealth or affection. Young
Atayal men and women are allowed to find their own partners, but
premarital sex is taboo and violators must slaughter a pig in
atonement, Tien said.</P>
      <P>Atayal men also play bamboo mouth organs to draw the attention of
their girls.</P>
      <P>The Saisiat people who live in the mountains near Hsinchu County,
northern Taiwan, exchange tobacco as a token of love and some Saisiat
women will plant a China fir after the wedding to show her "firmly
standing" commitment to marriage.</P>
      <P>The Tsou people of central Taiwan have a tradition of "seizing
brides, " with the young men taking home their women by force before
asking the tribe's elders to coordinate with the girls' parents for
formal marriage.</P>
      <P>The Thao people living near Sun Moon Lake in central Taiwan have
possibly the most dramatic marriage ceremonies in Taiwan.
When two families join in marriage, the family members from
each side exchange in a fistfight, and the harder the brawl,
the brighter the marriage's future is considered, said Tien.</P>

      <P>A total of 144 elementary and junior high

according to Monday's China Times newspaper.</P>
      <P>The paper quoted a survey conducted by Lee Chung-yi, a professor

18,000 students could be threatened by the electromagnetic fields.</P>
      <P>Judged by the locations of the schools, the survey found that 95
elementary schools and 49 junior high schools have part of their

      <P>In theory, such areas are affected by extreme low-frequency
electromagnetic fields with an intensity of more than 4 milligauss,

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 13 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) will conduct a
series of tests from Feb. 15 in 144 schools throughout Taiwan to find
out if high-voltage overhead power lines near the schools are
generating excessive non-ionizing radiation that might pose a health
risk, the Ministry of Education said Monday.</P>
      <P>Ministry officials indicated at a press conference that a study
done by Fu Jen Catholic University for the ministry has found that 95
primary schools and 49 junior high schools nationwide are located
within 20 meters of high-voltage power lines, exposing more than
18,000 students to the potential health risk from electromagnetic
fields.</P>
      <P>Media reports Monday quoted the results of studies on cancer
among children as saying that the incidence of cancer in some
children is related to their exposure to electromagnetic fields with
radiation higher than 4 milligauss (mG).</P>
      <P>However, according to the guidelines set by the International
Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) in 2001, the
limit of exposure of the general public to such radiation is 833 mG.
The ICNIRP is an organization of 15,000 scientists from 40 nations
who specialize in radiation protection.</P>
      <P>Taipower representatives claimed at the press conference that the
non-ionizing radiation from its high-voltage power lines near the 144
schools does not exceed the ICNIRP standard.</P>
      <P>Vice Education Minister Lu Mu-lin said the ministry has suggested
that the 144 schools turn classrooms close to high-voltage power
lines into storerooms or use them for purposes other than housing
children.</P>
      <P>He said Taipower has agreed to re-examine the electromagnetic
radiation levels in these schools and to relocate any power lines
away from any school where the radiation level is found to exceed the

    <HEADLINE>INVESTMENT IN INDIA TO DIVERSIFY, NOT  REPLACE CHINA: THINK TANK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Local businesses reaching out to India will
diversify their investment risks, the chairman of a private think
tank said Monday.</P>
      <P>Vincent Siew, a former premier who is now chairman of the Chung
Hua Institution for Economic Research, said the focus of investing in
India is not to replace China as an investment destination but to
diversify investment risk.</P>
      <P>Siew's remarks came amid signs of growing interest in investing
in India, with the Ministry of Economic Affairs encouraging Taiwan
businessmen to invest in India and ruling Democratic Progressive
Party Chairman Yu Shyi-kun being elected as the chairman of the Board
of Directors of the Taiwan-India Cooperation Council Saturday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan businesses can invest in two fields, Siew said, noting
that Taiwan businesses excel in such traditional industries as
textiles, plastics and chemicals, and mechanical products.</P>
      <P>The second is information technology, especially as India is
strong in software development while Taiwan is good at hardware
manufacturing, making the two countries complement each other, he
observed.</P>
      <P>On cross-Taiwan Strait economy, Siew said that judging from the
continued expansion of China-bound investments in recent years, the
government has not tried to deter Taiwan businesses from investing
in China and that to the contrary, it was actually riding the wave of
investment there.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan businesses have to expand out into the rest of
world for their own survival and development and that hot markets
such as China are major destinations.</P>
      <P>"Cross-strait economic integration is inevitable, " Siew said,
only now the pace is quicker and the scale grander.</P>
      <P>Faced with the emergence of China, the government should ride
the tide and lead local businesses, Siew said, adding that the more
important task should be to provide more transparent information on
China so as to help Taiwan businessmen make their own judgments.</P>

(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of homosexuals in Taiwan want
same-sex marriage to be legalized and hope their relationships will
one day be protected by law like heterosexuals, the results of an
online survey released by a gay rights advocacy group on the eve of
Valentine's day showed.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by Taiwan Tongzhi (Homosexuals) Hotline
Association (TTHA), showed 89 percent of homosexuals in the survey
wanted same-sex marriage to be legalized in Taiwan, with 57 percent
of respondents saying they would marry once same-sex marriage is
legalized.</P>
      <P>"Only a handful of countries have legalized same-sex marriages,
including Canada, Spain, Denmark, Belgium, Netherlands and some
states in the U.S. We hope Taiwan will join the list soon, " said
Cheng Chi-wei, TTHA's director of social work.</P>
      <P>A large majority of respondents -- 81 percent -- said same-sex
marriage should be legalized because "it is a civil right." And 90
percent of those polled who wanted to marry said they wanted to be
protected by the law and have the same income tax benefits and health
insurance coverage as heterosexual couples.</P>
      <P>However, only 37 percent of respondents wanted to have children.
Thirty percent responded that they did not want to have children while
37 percent said they were unsure.</P>
      <P>There were 300 participants in the online survey, with 47 percent
identifying themselves as gay, 28 percent as lesbian, 14 as bisexual
and 11 percent as transsexual.</P>
      <P>In 1998, the TTHA became the first registered LGBT (lesbian, gay,
bisexual and transsexual) association in Taiwan, and was created as a
source of support for gays and lesbians.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HALF OF OFFICE WORKERS TO HAVE LONESOME VALENTINE'S DAY: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 13 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>About half of Taiwan's office workers will
be celebrating Valentine's Day Tuesday alone and without a lover
beside them, with 56 percent of that number saying they would feel
especially lonesome because it is a day for lovers, a survey found.</P>
      <P>Career.com.tw and InsightXplorer Limited conducted a survey on
the "loneliness index of office workers" between Jan. 27 and Feb. 8,
with 958 valid samples.</P>
      <P>The results showed 89 percent of Taiwan's office workers are
experiencing loneliness for one of several reasons: their monotonous
life, not having a girlfriend or boyfriend or not gaining a sense of
achievement from their work.</P>
      <P>Despite their busy and demanding work schedule, 60 percent of
office workers said they felt lonesome "occasionally, " with 28
percent saying they felt down "regularly" or "daily."</P>
      <P>As for feeling forlorn, 40 percent attributed the reason to their
monotonous life -- more so than those who felt lonesome because they
didn't have a sweetheart.</P>
      <P>How do Taiwanese office workers expect to meet the love of their
life? Sixty-seven percent of respondents said they wanted to meet
their better halves at work, followed by those who preferred
introductions by friends or relatives and those who preferred to make
contact over the Internet. Sixty percent wanted to meet a new flame
by attending a social function sponsored by their companies.</P>
      <P>Almost 60 percent of respondents who were presently attached or
planned to be so in the future said they would accept sweet talk over
the telephone or Internet if they could not be in the same city or
town as their loved one.</P>
      <P>But when asked what they would do if they had to work in a
different location than their beloved, 70 percent said they would
accept the job offer before discussing it with their lover.</P>
      <P>In that same scenario, 10 percent said they would definitely
prioritize work over their relationships, and accept the change in
employment while looking gloomily at the prospect of maintaining a
long-distance relationship.</P>
      <P>The last findings seem to indicate that in a struggle between
work and romance, reality seems to prevail.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb.  13 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's China Steel Corp. has rejected a
takeover offer by Mittal Steel Co., the world's largest steelmaker, a
spokesman for China Steel confirmed Monday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said Mittal Steel made the offer through an
investment bank to purchase privatized China Steel, which is 23.3
percent owned by the state.</P>
      <P>However, China Steel rejected the bid, because as Taiwan's
largest steelmaker China Steel had no need to merge with any foreign
steel giant, nor did it have any intention of selling itself to
another steel company, he said.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said China Steel would keep a neutral stand on
possible future moves by Mittal Steel to purchase China Steel shares
in the stock market.</P>
      <P>He added if Mittal Steel decided to do so, "it would have to pay
a considerable price."</P>
      <P>Mittal Steel, based in Rotterdam in the Netherlands, rose from
modest beginnings in India 30 years ago to become the world's largest
steel producer in 2004 after a series of takeover bids that enabled
the company to straddle four continents, with shipments of more than
42 million tons and sales of more than US$30 billion a year.</P>
      <P>The company is 88 percent owned by London-based industrialist
Lakshmi Mittal, who was born in India and said to be the world's

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan can expect to see its research and
development program in nanotechnology bearing fruit within two or
three years when the field's annual product value is expected to
reach NT$300 billion in 2008 and up to NT$1 trillion in 2012,
according to a leading scientist here.</P>
      <P>Wu Maw-kuen, a member of Academia Sinica and a former
minister of the National Science Council (NSC), said Monday at a
seminar that Taiwan has invested NT$23.1 billion in national
science projects devoted to nanotechnology research and development.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has made excellent progress in developing materials at
nanometer scale with the techniques it has acquired, and young people
are quite often well-educated in nanophysics and nanochemistry, Wu
said.</P>
      <P>Wu said that Taiwan's hi-tech industry began investing in this
area of research and development earlier than other countries.</P>
      <P>He added that nanotechnological exchanges between academics and
industries in Taiwan occur frequently, but efforts could be made to
expand cooperative efforts in the domain.</P>
      <P>Wu predicts that between 2008 and 2010 many of Taiwan's products
will be produced using elements of the nanometric scale.</P>
      <P>However, he pointed out the great difference between the
application of nanotechnology and the use of nano-structure
components.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOI PLANS LAW REVISIONS FOR SKY LANTERN MANAGEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) said
Monday it plans to propose revisions to the present Fire Law to
require prior approval of floating of "hot-air" sky lantern.</P>
      <P>MOI Minister Lee Yi-yang made the statement a day after wayward
"hot-air" paper lanterns, with torches in the middle, set off a blaze
at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, forcing airport authorities
to shut down a runway for three hours.</P>
      <P>As releasing sky lanterns is a fascinating folk activity in
celebration of the traditional Lantern Festival, Lee said the
government has no plan to ban it. But he added that for safety
concerns, the ministry is considering revising the Fire Law to allow
for "active management" of sky lantern floating.</P>
      <P>No law can restrict or manage sky lantern floating at present.
Under the current Fire Law, organizers of fireworks displays are
required to apply for approval of city or and fire departments in
advance and no fireworks display is allowed in areas near airports,
oil depots, chemical plants densely populated residential communities
and commercial districts as well as other regions prone to fire.</P>
      <P>Lee said the MOI plans to amend the Fire Law to have sky lantern
floating subject to the same regulations as fireworks displays.</P>
      <P>Many local people celebrate the Lantern Festival, the 15th day of
the Lunar New Year, which fell on Sunday this year, by writing their
New Year wishes on the paper lanterns and releasing them into the
sky. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of sky lanterns were flying around
the island.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RELATIONSHIP COUNSELING MUCH-NEEDED AMONG GAY COMMUNITY: GROUP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 13 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Relationship advice and counseling is the
most needed form of assistance among the gay community in Taiwan,
mostly because they have no one to turn to, an advocacy group said at
its annual press conference Monday.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Tongzhi Hotline Association (TTHA) , which set up a
telephone hotline for counseling homosexuals, received more than 900
telephone calls in 2005, with 39 percent of callers seeking
counseling for relationships-related issues, said Wu Hsu-liang, who
serves as TTHA's director of public relations.</P>
      <P>Wu said the issue has been the primary reason for calls made to
the hotline for five straight years, indicating that gays are
concerned about discrimination in society and aren't receiving the
support they need from family and friends who are heterosexual.</P>
      <P>"The hotline tries to provide a discreet atmosphere and
professional counseling to those who need help but can't find someone
to talk about it with in their daily lives," Wu added.</P>
      <P>TTHA statistics showed 52 percent of calls came from repeat
callers.</P>
      <P>"No one is supposed to get over relationship problems overnight.
It's a continual process that might take a while, say six months," Wu
said.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the incidence of sex identity-related phone
calls has dropped to its lowest number in five years, which TTHA
considers an encouraging sign.</P>
      <P>"This tells us that Taiwan -- considered the leading country in
Asia when it comes to open attitudes about homosexuality -- has been
making substantial progress in sexual equality, " said Cheng Chi-wei,
TTHA's Director of Social Work.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the percentage of callers who are parents of
homosexual children has increased to an all-time high of 9 percent --
another promising sign, according to TTHA.</P>
      <P>"Having gay kids places a lot of pressure on parents. I'm glad to
see that more parents are trying to help their children through
professional counseling, " said a woman surnamed Kuo who provides
private counseling for parents with homosexual children.</P>
      <P>"Education is key in the promotion of understanding about
homosexual relationships and gender equality. In the coming year, we
will be working to promote the idea of pluralist thinking, or
`Multiple Intelligences, ' in schools, which is something lacking at
this time, although the Gender Equality Education Law was passed by
the Legislative Yuan in 2004, " said TTHA Office Director Lai
Kang-yen.</P>
      <P>In 1998, TTHA became the first registered LGBT (lesbian, gay,
bisexual and transsexual) association in Taiwan, and was established
to provide counseling and support for gays and lesbians.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP FEARS KMT'S MA MAY HAVE FALLEN INTO DPP TRAP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 13 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
might have fallen into the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's trap
when he said Taipei should not hold talks with Beijing until it
agrees to dismantle missiles targeted at Taiwan, a senior People
First Party (PFP) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chang Hsien-yao, director of the PFP's Policy Center, said
the DPP's old strategy of "no missile withdrawal, no talk" was its
way of avoiding cross-strait negotiation, but that it would only put
bilateral relations in a deadlock.</P>
      <P>Commenting on media speculation regarding his "pan-blue" ally's
tough stance toward China, Chang said the trend in international
politics was to initiate dialogue and negotiation, then strengthen
communication so as to reduce tensions and avoid conflict, and
finally, establish a mechanism for building mutual trust on issues of
a military nature.</P>
      <P>He said missile deployment and peace talks were two completely
different matters that should not be predicated on the existence of
each other. For example, he noted, during the Cold War, the United
States and the Soviet Union had summit meetings regularly, which
eventually led to an end to the Cold War.</P>
      <P>"If you insist that China dismantle its missiles before you have
even agreed to talk about it, it may just worsen the cross-strait
standoff," Chang said.</P>
      <P>He explained that part of China's strategy for missile deployment
was an attempt to reach a type of "strategic balance" with Japan and
the United States.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he added, it was quite unlikely that China would take
the initiative in dismantling its missiles.</P>
      <P>If cross-strait ties remain gridlocked, he said, it could
seriously impact economic interaction, joint efforts to strike out
crime and other practical matters such as the protection of Taiwanese
business interests in China.</P>
      <P>He said he would assume that Ma was responding to a media query
as Ma's remarks were quite different from those of his predecessor
Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>"I think the KMT's platform remains unchanged," he added.</P>
      <P>The PFP and the KMT form the so-called "pan-blue" alliance in
Taiwan's politics. In the "pan-green" camp are the DPP and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's state-owned Chinese Petroleum
Corp. (CPC) announced late Monday that prices for its major oil
products will be raised from Tuesday noon.</P>
      <P>Starting Tuesday noon, prices for gasoline and premium diesel
fuel will be raised by NT$1 per liter and fuel oil prices will be
raised by NT$460 per kiloliter.</P>
      <P>CPC officials said the upward adjustments will help cut the
company's monthly financial losses by an estimated NT$1.3 billion.</P>
      <P>The price hikes were announced shortly after the Cabinet unveiled
new guidelines for domestic oil price adjustment and authorized the
CPC to decide on its own whether and when to adjust its product
prices and the adjustment range in accordance with the new
guidelines.</P>
      <P>Key points of the guidelines included that the CPC must make a
timely response whenever international crude oil prices decline; the
CPC should not collaborate with Formosa Petrochemical Corp., Taiwan's
second largest oil refining company, in manipulating domestic
gasoline prices; the CPC should maintain transparency in its
financial status.</P>
      <P>Cabinet spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang, who is also minister of the
Government Information Office, announced the new guidelines at a news
conference Monday night.</P>
      <P>As to whether electricity and water rates should be adjusted to
reflect rising energy costs, Cheng said they should be decided in
line with the existing adjustment mechanisms.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the same occasion, Minister of Economic Affairs Hwang
Ing-san said the government will not interfere with CPC's oil product
pricing based on market mechanism unless an international energy
shortage or drastic crude oil price fluctuation has reached the point
that domestic oil supply or national security is at stake.</P>
      <P>Hwang said the CPC will abide by several major principles in
adjusting its product prices, including international crude oil
prices; dynamic adjustment of its profit targets to help maintain
domestic consumer price stability; lowering its oil prices whenever
international crude prices declines; no collaboration with Formosa
Petrochemical Corp.; regularly unveiling its financial situation; and
working out a plan to upgrade its operation efficiency while cutting
production costs.</P>

the increase is checked by moral restraints or by war, famine, or
disease.

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S NANOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH TO BEAR FRUIT SOON: ACADEMIC(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 13 (CNA)
(By Taijing Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan can expect to see its research and
development program in nanotechnology bearing fruit within two or
three years when the field's annual product value is expected to
reach NT$300 billion in 2008 and up to NT$1 trillion in 2012,
according to a leading scientist here.</P>
      <P>Wu Maw-kuen, a member of Academia Sinica and a former
minister of the National Science Council (NSC), said Monday at a
seminar that Taiwan has invested NT$23.1 billion in national
science projects devoted to nanotechnology research and development.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has made excellent progress in developing materials at
nanometer scale with the techniques it has acquired, and young people
are quite often well-educated in nanophysics and nanochemistry, Wu
said.</P>
      <P>Wu said that Taiwan's hi-tech industry began investing in this
area of research and development earlier than other countries.</P>
      <P>He added that nanotechnological exchanges between academics and
industries in Taiwan occur frequently, but efforts could be made to
expand cooperative efforts in the domain.</P>
      <P>Wu predicts that between 2008 and 2010 many of Taiwan's products
will be produced using elements of the nanometric scale.</P>
      <P>However, he pointed out the great difference between the
application of nanotechnology and the use of nano-structure
components.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOI PLANS LAW REVISIONS FOR SKY LANTERN MANAGEMENT(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) said
Monday it plans to propose revisions to the present Fire Law to
require prior approval of floating of "hot-air" sky lantern.</P>
      <P>MOI Minister Lee Yi-yang made the statement a day after wayward
"hot-air" paper lanterns, with torches in the middle, set off a blaze
at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, forcing airport authorities
to shut down a runway for three hours.</P>
      <P>As releasing sky lanterns is a fascinating folk activity in
celebration of the traditional Lantern Festival, Lee said the
government has no plan to ban it. But he added that for safety
concerns, the ministry is considering revising the Fire Law to allow
for "active management" of sky lantern floating.</P>
      <P>No law can restrict or manage sky lantern floating at present.
Under the current Fire Law, organizers of fireworks displays are
required to apply for approval of city or and fire departments in
advance and no fireworks display is allowed in areas near airports,
oil depots, chemical plants densely populated residential communities
and commercial districts as well as other regions prone to fire.</P>
      <P>Lee said the MOI plans to amend the Fire Law to have sky lantern
floating subject to the same regulations as fireworks displays.</P>
      <P>Many local people celebrate the Lantern Festival, the 15th day of
the Lunar New Year, which fell on Sunday this year, by writing their
New Year wishes on the paper lanterns and releasing them into the
sky. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of sky lanterns were flying around
the island.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RELATIONSHIP COUNSELING MUCH-NEEDED AMONG GAY COMMUNITY: GROUP(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 13 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Relationship advice and counseling is the
most needed form of assistance among the gay community in Taiwan,
mostly because they have no one to turn to, an advocacy group said at
its annual press conference Monday.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Tongzhi Hotline Association (TTHA) , which set up a
telephone hotline for counseling homosexuals, received more than 900
telephone calls in 2005, with 39 percent of callers seeking
counseling for relationships-related issues, said Wu Hsu-liang, who
serves as TTHA's director of public relations.</P>
      <P>Wu said the issue has been the primary reason for calls made to
the hotline for five straight years, indicating that gays are
concerned about discrimination in society and aren't receiving the
support they need from family and friends who are heterosexual.</P>
      <P>"The hotline tries to provide a discreet atmosphere and
professional counseling to those who need help but can't find someone
to talk about it with in their daily lives," Wu added.</P>
      <P>TTHA statistics showed 52 percent of calls came from repeat
callers.</P>
      <P>"No one is supposed to get over relationship problems overnight.
It's a continual process that might take a while, say six months," Wu
said.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the incidence of sex identity-related phone
calls has dropped to its lowest number in five years, which TTHA
considers an encouraging sign.</P>
      <P>"This tells us that Taiwan -- considered the leading country in
Asia when it comes to open attitudes about homosexuality -- has been
making substantial progress in sexual equality, " said Cheng Chi-wei,
TTHA's Director of Social Work.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the percentage of callers who are parents of
homosexual children has increased to an all-time high of 9 percent --
another promising sign, according to TTHA.</P>
      <P>"Having gay kids places a lot of pressure on parents. I'm glad to
see that more parents are trying to help their children through
professional counseling, " said a woman surnamed Kuo who provides
private counseling for parents with homosexual children.</P>
      <P>"Education is key in the promotion of understanding about
homosexual relationships and gender equality. In the coming year, we
will be working to promote the idea of pluralist thinking, or
`Multiple Intelligences, ' in schools, which is something lacking at
this time, although the Gender Equality Education Law was passed by
the Legislative Yuan in 2004, " said TTHA Office Director Lai
Kang-yen.</P>
      <P>In 1998, TTHA became the first registered LGBT (lesbian, gay,
bisexual and transsexual) association in Taiwan, and was established
to provide counseling and support for gays and lesbians.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 14 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>Today is Tuesday, Feb. 14, or the 17th day
of the first month of the Year of the Dog according to the lunar
calendar. Following is a list of important events that have occurred
on this date in the past:

1766: Thomas R. Malthus, the British economist who wrote "An
Essay on the Principle of Population," is born. His 1798 work argues
that populations tend to increase faster than food supplies unless
the increase is checked by moral restraints or by war, famine, or
disease.

1779: Captain James Cook, the British navigator and explorer who
commanded three major voyages of "discovery," charting and "naming"
many islands in the Pacific Ocean, is killed by a native's spear in
Hawaii.

1797: British naval forces under Admiral John Jervis and Captain
Horatio Nelson defeat the Spanish fleet off Portugal's Cape St.
Vincent.

1859: Oregon becomes the 33rd state of the United States.

the National Cash Register Company (now NCR Corporation) for 15
years, is made president of a company that later becomes
International Business Machines Corporation (IBM).

1933: The League of Nations refuses to recognize the Japanese
puppet regime known as "Manchukuo." To deflect world condemnation of
their hegemony, the Japanese invaders of northern China installed the
Manchukuo regime in 1932. This "land of the Manchu" proved to be no
more than another stepping stone for the extension of Japanese
aggression.

1939: The German battleship Bismarck is launched.

1950: The Chinese communist regime and the Soviet Union sign the
"Sino-Soviet Friendly Alliance and Mutual Assistance Treaty" in
Moscow.

1956: Soviet President Nikita Khrushchev denounces the policies
of Joseph Stalin at the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party.

1962: General Hu Chung-nan, strategic adviser to President Chiang
Kai-shek, dies in Taipei at the age of 68.

moon.

1972: Washington relaxes trade restrictions against Beijing,
putting it on the same basis as Moscow.

1973: Walter Benche Medina, newly-appointed ambassador of El
Salvador, arrives in Taipei to assume his post.

1974: A six-member Jordanian trade mission led by S.A. Matouk,
president of the Amman Chamber of Commerce, arrives in Taipei for a
weeklong visit.

1974: Commissioner W. Stanley Cottrill, international secretary
of the Salvation Army International Headquarters, leaves Taipei after
a three-day visit.

1975: The Marinas Islands in the Pacific becomes a territory of
the United States.

1977: Shih Wei-liang, a noted Republic of China musician, dies in
Taipei at the age of 54.

1989: Ayatollah Khomeini, Iran's religious leader, issues a
"fatwa," or death sentence, against British writer Salman Rushdie for
what he deemed to be blasphemy in the author's book "The Satanic
Verses," sending him into years of hiding.

1999: Former Nixon White House aide John Ehrlichman dies at the
age of 73. He served 18 months in prison for his role in the
Watergate cover-up.

2000: President Lee Teng-hui confers the Order of the Brilliant
Star with Grand Cordon on Cor Boonstra, president of Royal Philips
Electronics, in recognition of his company's contribution to Taiwan's
economic development.

2000: Democratic Progressive Party presidential candidate Chen

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI COUNTY TO SET UP GUIDELINES FOR SKY LANTERN ACTIVITIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  14 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the Fire Law to be revised to allow
for "active management" of the releasing of sky lanterns, the Taipei
County Government decided Tuesday to set up its own guidelines for
the management of the activity to minimize the possibility of sky
lantern-related accidents.</P>
      <P>The county government is responsible for any such accidents as it
has spared no efforts to promote the traditional Lantern Day festival
activity, Deputy Magistrate Chen Wei-jen said at a regular meeting of
county officials.</P>
      <P>Pinhsi township in the northern county has been a center of sky
lantern activities, with the small town attracting nearly 30,000
people to join or watch the event this year.</P>
      <P>To preserve the meaningful folk ritual, it is crucial for the
local government to review current measures in organizing activities
of the kind and to formulate a set of management guidelines based on
safety considerations, such as prohibiting people from releasing sky
lanterns from the top floors of the buildings where they live, in
order to prevent accidents, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The government proposal to revise the Fire Law came following an
incident Sunday night when a wayward sky lantern set a grass field
near a runway at Chiang Kai-shek Airport ablaze, causing airport
operations to be halted for nearly three hours.</P>
      <P>There were also several fires apparently started by landing sky
lanterns in the mountainous area between Taipei and Taoyuan counties
the same evening.</P>
      <P>In response to these incidents, Minister of the Interior Lee
Yi-yang on Monday proposed revising the law to require prior approval
for sky lantern release activities.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA) will lead a trade delegation to visit the South
Asian countries of India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in late March to
try to tap the booming market, a TAITRA official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the TAITRA official, South Asian countries are
expected to form a free trade zone covering more than 1.2 billion
people within 10 years. By 2012, products traded within the bloc will
enjoy tariff free treatment.</P>
      <P>To help Taiwan companies to diversify their investment to other
markets outside China, the government has been encouraging local
enterprises to tap the Indian market by extending all its trade
services to them.</P>
      <P>India, being one of the promising BRIC countries (Brasil, Russia,
India and China), is expected to be among the five biggest economies
in the world by 2040, the official said.</P>
      <P>With India's rapid economic growth during the last few years,
coupled with the soon to be established South Asia free trade zone,
the trade opportunities in the region are very promising, the
official added.</P>
      <P>In addition to organizing a fact-finding visit to the three South

    <HEADLINE>MAC CHAIR TALKS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN KMT, DPP CHINA POLICY WITH BBC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  14 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu discussed the major differences between the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) China policy and that of the
main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) in an interview Sunday with BBC's
Hardtalk TV program producer.</P>
      <P>Talking to Sian Giffiths, producer of the daily current affairs
program, in a 50-minute phone interview, Wu elaborated on the
differences between the two parties in their respective policies on
the development of Taiwan-China relations.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the DPP wants to effectively beef up Taiwan's
defense capability to deal with China's rapid military buildup in the
Taiwan Strait in recent years. However, the KMT has turned a blind
eye to China's military threat to Taiwan and has blocked a major arms
procurement bill from clearing the Legislative Yuan more than 40
times since mid-2004, he said. The KMT and its "pan blue alliance"
ally jointly hold a slim majority at the legislature.</P>
      <P>Internationally, the DPP has been doing its best to seek entry
for Taiwan in major world bodies, including the United Nations and
the World Health Organization, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The KMT, on the other hand, has not spoken out against China's
attempts to suppress Taiwan in the international community, Wu said.
As an example, he noted that the KMT did not protest the fact that
KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou was unable to include Athens on the
itinerary of his current European visit due to pressure from Beijing.</P>
      <P>Wu also pointed out that during various international sporting
events held in Taipei city, where Ma serves as mayor, citizens were
barred from carrying ROC national flags.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's status is the most subtle and most sensitive issue that
differentiates the DPP from the KMT, Wu said. The DPP upholds
Taiwan's sovereignty as an independent nation, while the KMT remains
ambiguous in this regard, and both former KMT Chairman Lien Chan and
current KMT Chairman Ma have accepted Beijing's "one China" principle
in public, he said.</P>
      <P>Griffiths interviewed Wu to gain a better understanding of the
Taiwan government's China policy prior to a planned Monday interview
with Ma, who is currently visiting Britain in his capacity as Taipei
mayor.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSU LAWMAKER QUESTIONS KMT CHAIRMAN'S COMMON MARKET IDEA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  14 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator of the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) questioned the appropriateness of a proposal
by opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-yeou for Taiwan to
form a common market with China for their mutual economic benefit.</P>
      <P>Huang Shih-chuo, a whip of the TSU caucus at the Legislative
Yuan, said he believes economic integration can only move forward
based on the principle that the parties involved are independent,
sovereign countries.</P>
      <P>Given China's refusal to treat Taiwan on an equal footing, Taiwan
and China forming a common market like the one in Europe would do
nothing for Taiwan except cost the country its economic
competitiveness, he claimed, adding that Taiwan would be marginalized
as Beijing would only treat it as a part of its domestic market.</P>
      <P>Ma made the common market proposal during a round-table forum
hosted by the U.K. Royal United Services Institute for Defence and
Security Monday in London. In making the proposal, he noted that
China plans to sign a free trade agreement with the 10-state
Association of Southeast Asian Nations in 2010.</P>
      <P>Ma arrived in London Feb. 10 for a five-day visit to study the
country's urban development and seek business and investment
opportunities for Taiwan's capital. Ma also serves as Taipei mayor.</P>
      <P>Huang said that in his opinion, the best way to sharpen Taiwan's
economic competitive edge is to "invest in Taiwan." It is better for
the government to make practical efforts to preserve local industry's
roots in Taiwan, rather than spending valuable resources on trying to
build an "illusory" common market, he claimed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROSECUTOR GENERAL TO ASSESS WHETHER TO SPEED UP KRTC SCANDAL PROBE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Feb.  14  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A new prosecutor general, who is
expected to be appointed by the end of this month, will evaluate
whether to assign a team of special prosecutors to investigate
corruption allegations at Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) ,
Justice Minister Shih Mao-lin said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Currently, the case is being handled by Kaohsiung district
prosecutors who have indicted several former city officials as well
as former KRTC Vice Chairman Chen Min-hsien on charges of malfeasance
and other irregularities. Critics say local prosecutors have done a
poor job in gathering evidence about the scandal.</P>
      <P>State Public Prosecutor General Wu Ying-chao announced his
resignation on Dec. 27 to take responsibility for failing to stamp
out bribery during the Dec. 3 local government elections. His
replacement has yet to be appointed.</P>
      <P>During a meeting about cracking down on vote-buying in the
southern port city, Shih said if the new prosecutor general thought
the Kaohsiung prosecutors had been too slow in investigating the
case, the new prosecutor general could transfer it to a special team
of prosecutors.</P>
      <P>Regarding Hualien district prosecutor Lee Tzu-chun's intention to
join the group, Shih said as long as Lee was up for the job and the
new prosecutor general agreed, he would not keep Lee out of the ad
hoc team.</P>
      <P>Lee has been voicing his views about the KRTC probe and other
related subjects on TV talk shows, angering some in the government
and in the ruling party. Shih said Lee's behavior has had a negative
impact on the profession, and he would look into the matter and
decide whether Lee had broken any laws or regulations governing the
behavior of public officials.</P>
      <P>"If necessary, Lee will be disciplined," Shih said.</P>
      <P>But in Tainan, Shih told reporters the Ministry of Justice would
not intervene if Prosecutor Lee was just "expressing his personal
views."</P>
      <P>The KRTC scandal erupted in August last year after Thai workers
working on the city's rapid transit project rioted to protest their
inhumane treatment by a labor brokerage company contracted by KRTC.</P>
      <P>The incident brought to light a series of irregularities
involving KRTC managers and city government officials, including
alleged law-breaking in the procurement of construction contracts,
human rights violations in the importation and hiring of foreign
workers and suspected kickbacks.</P>

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The image of the "Taipei 101," the tallest
skyscraper in the world, began to appear on the new version of
Taiwan's visa stickers Jan. 11, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Since Jan. 11, Taiwan's overseas embassies and representative
offices have been using the new version of visa stickers for foreign
tourists intending to visit Taiwan," MOFA Spokesman Michel Lu said.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, the new visa stickers have drawn a positive
reaction from foreign visitors.</P>
      <P>Lu, at a MOFA press conference, said the "Taipei 101" image
represented the island's highest form of welcome being extended to
foreign tourists. An older version of Taiwan's visa stickers carried
the image of a black-faced spoonbill, one of the rarest bird species
in the world.</P>
      <P>Referring to the building owner's recent move to register "Taipei
101" as a trademark, Lu stressed that the MOFA's use of the image was
not for profit-making purposes. Moreover, he said, the approval of
the building administrator had been obtained, so the new visa
stickers would not violate any trademark regulations.</P>
      <P>Short-term foreign visitors from 30 countries, including Austria,
Australia, Canada and Japan, to whom the ROC government has granted a
30-day visa-free privilege, will not have the opportunity to receive
the new version of Taiwan visa stickers, Lu added.</P>

      <P>To resume cross-Taiwan Strait negotiations,
China must renounce its military intimidation of Taiwan, Taipei Mayor
Ma Ying-jeou said in London Monday.</P>
      <P>Noting that dismantling missiles aimed at Taiwan is just one
prerequisite for re-opening cross-strait negotiations, Ma emphasized
that China must give up the threat of using force against Taiwan and
that this is the primary reason behind his proposal to set up a
"military trust" mechanism between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is also chairman of Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT), made the remarks while fielding questions from Jonathan Eyal,
Director of Studies at Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), after
making a speech on "The Rise of Asia and China: Prospects for Peace
or Conflict" at the highly respected defense and security thinktank.</P>
      <P>Around 50 researchers and British government officials in charge
of Far Eastern affairs attended the activity.</P>
      <P>Should the KMT return to power in the 2008 presidential election,
Ma said, it would seek to ink a deal on a cross-strait peace
framework with China to pave the way for setting up a bilateral
military trust mechanism, establishing a cross-strait common market
and discussing Taiwan's representation at world bodies.</P>
      <P>Ma also called on the European Union not to consider lifting its
ban on arms exports to China before Beijing has abandoned its
military threat against Taiwan. The KMT head said he strongly
believes that maintaining peace in the strait also serves the E. U.'s
interests.</P>

      <P>He called a meeting of prosecutors and local police chiefs in

      <P>The development of a new strain of green
asparagus was announced on Tuesday in the southern county of Tainan,
with cultivators recommending the nutritious vegetable for its fast

      <P>The farm's supervisor, Huang Shan-nei, said that several of the

No.4" reportedly can fetch 20 percent more than its common relatives
on the retail market.</P>
      <P>The new strain has proven to adapt well to Taiwan's environment

      <P>The Epoch Times, a Falun Gong-supported
newspaper, launched a one-week relay hunger strike Tuesday outside
the second exhibition hall of the Taipei World Trade Center to
protest recent violent actions taken against members of their group
by the Chinese authorities.</P>
      <P>The relay hunger strike began earlier this month in North
America, with similar actions being undertaken by other Falun Gong
practitioners in Hong Kong, Macau and Malaysia.</P>
      <P>A spokeswoman for the newspaper said Lee Yuan, one of the Epoch

Feb. 8 in his Atlanta, Georgia apartment by Chinese secret agents.
Then the agents destroyed his computer equipment, with which he had
maintained the newspaper's Web site.</P>
      <P>Lee had reportedly succeeded in breaking through Chinese Internet
restrictions to publish online the number of members who had left the
Communist Party of China (CPC). The Epoch Times claimed eight million

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators from both the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) and ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) called
on Premier Su Tseng-chang Tuesday to appoint members to the National
Communications Commission (NCC).</P>
      <P>Legislator Tina Wei-kang Pan, who is secretary of the KMT's
legislative Caucus, said the premier's foot-dragging in naming the
NCC members would be considered a form of contempt and certainly
damage his ties with the legislature.</P>
      <P>Noting that Su, who took office on Jan. 25, "hasn't made any
goodwill gestures yet" toward the legislature, Pan said the premier
could enjoy the honeymoon by naming the NCC members according to the
legislature's wishes, or else the premier would be "failing in his
duty, disrespecting the legislature, cheating the people and making a
fool of the scholars who chose the nominees for the NCC."</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan, which has dismissed as unconstitutional the
NCC Act founding the commission, is seeking the Council of Grand
Justice's interpretation on the validity of the act, a request that
is still pending in the council.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a DPP leader in the legislature, Chen Ching-jun, said
Tuesday the premier would be better off naming the NCC members if the
Grand Justice Council's rule is still unavailable by Feb. 21, when
legislators gather for the new session.</P>
      <P>By appointing the NCC's members, Chen said, the premier can set
the right tone with the legislature as he begins his term.</P>
      <P>The dispute lies in a provision of the NCC Act, which stipulates
that NCC member candidates should be chosen by a special panel
comprised of scholars recommended by political parties according to
the number of seats they hold in the legislature, with the selected
candidates gaining the legislature's approval before being appointed
by the premier.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan denounces the provision as an infringement of
its power as well as a violation of the division of power between the
executive and legislative branches as stipulated by the Constitution.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 14 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition Kuomintang (KMT) proposal for
a Taiwan-China common market is mere "wishful thinking" in light of
Beijing's "ambition to invade" Taiwan, a local economist claimed
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In a speech delivered Monday at the London School of Economics
and Political Science, KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou proposed that the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait work toward the goal of establishing a
common market.</P>
      <P>This cross-strait economic integration, combined with the
China-ASEAN free trade zone expected to be set up in 2010, would form
one of the largest economic blocs in the world, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Ma's proposal, Taiwan Thinktank Chairman Chen
Po-chih dismissed it as something that a "layman who does not
understand economics" would say.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the European Economic Community, the
precursor to the European Union which has become a positive example
of international cooperation, has been successful mainly because the
member nations are not aggressive toward one another and maintain
political cooperation.</P>
      <P>But such cooperation is impossible across the strait because
China has so far refused to renounce its military threat against
Taiwan, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen said the establishment of a Taiwan-China common market would
mean that products traded between the two countries would enjoy equal
tariff levels and he expressed doubted that China would adjust its
tariffs downward to Taiwan levels.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, with workers able to move freely between
the countries participating in the common market, the KMT would have
to be prepared to allow an unlimited inflow of Chinese workers into
Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN UNDER ATTACK OVER 'ONE CHINA' REMARKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 14 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
came under attack Tuesday by the "pan-green" camp of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU),
after he defined the relationship between Taiwan and China as "equal
political partners under the 'one China' framework, " and warned that
"unilateral separatism" will be "the antidote that invokes disaster"
for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Legislators from the two pro-independence parties accused Ma of
acting as Beijing's mouthpiece and degrading Taiwan's status as a
sovereign state that is independent of China.</P>
      <P>They were referring to a speech given by Ma at the London School
of Economics and Political Science Monday, entitled "Bridging the
Divide: A Vision for Peace in East Asia."</P>
      <P>Ma, a possible KMT contender for the 2008 presidency, said in the
speech that the Constitution currently implemented in Taiwan was
drafted under the "one China" principle, and that if in the future
China becomes compatible with Taiwan in terms its political, economic
and social development, the KMT would not rule out "ultimate
unification" as an option in cross-Taiwan strait relations.</P>
      <P>However, Ma said the KMT was against any unilateral move to
change the cross-strait status quo and that any move toward
unification must be approved by the people of Taiwan, adding that the
KMT had not set a timetable for unification.</P>
      <P>Ma expressed disapproval for what he described as steps taken by
some of Taiwan's politicians to unilaterally separate Taiwan from
China. According to Ma, these steps include planning to draft a new
constitution, changing the official name of the country, putting into
place "desinicization" policies aimed at severing Taiwan's
connections with the Chinese culture, provoking hatred against China,
suppressing cross-strait exchanges and engaging in a cross-strait
arms race.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Ma's speech, Chen Chin-jun, a DPP legislative
caucus whip, said Ma's statement dubbing Taiwan and China as "equal
political partners under the 'one China' framework" signified a step
backwards in cross-strait relations, compared with former President
Lee Teng-hui's affirmation that China and Taiwan are "two equal
political entities" or President Chen Shui-bian's assertion that
Taiwan and China are "two countries on either side of the Taiwan
Strait."</P>
      <P>The legislator stressed that the so-called "one-China" framework
or "1992 consensus" was non-existent and that the fate of Taiwan
should be decided by the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He claimed it would be impossible for the people of Taiwan to
vote for a presidential candidate who does not recognize Taiwan as an
independent, sovereign state.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, TSU legislative caucus convener, David C. Huang, said
Ma was not the "new Taiwanese" he has termed himself but a "real
Chinese" who denies Taiwan's sovereign status and embraces China.</P>
      <P>Huang said it was extremely inappropriate for Ma to "speak on
China's behalf" and to warn Taiwan against practicing "separatism."</P>
      <P>"Intimidating the people of Taiwan on behalf of Beijing's regime,
Ma is not even trying to conceal his alliance with the Chinese
communists against Taiwan," Huang alleged.</P>
      <P>Huang said "there must be a timetable for unification in Ma's
mind, " because Huang said Ma has repeatedly revealed his "greater
China" mentality and goal for "ultimate unification" after assuming
the KMT chairmanship last year.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that only the 23 million in Taiwan have the right
to determine Taiwan's fate and urged Ma to stop "aligning himself
with the Chinese communists" in order to boost his bid for the 2008
presidency.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EPA TO ASSESS HEALTH RISKS OF HIGH-VOLTAGE POWER IN 144 SCHOOLS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 14 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) will evaluate health risks to schoolchildren posed by
high-voltage power lines in 144 schools throughout Taiwan, EPA
Administrator Chang Kuo-lung announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang told reporters that experts from the Ministry of Economic
Affairs and the Department of Health will be invited to take part in
the assessment and set up a standard for safety levels that is
appropriate to people in Taiwan with respect to human exposure to
electromagnetic radiation from high-voltage utility lines.</P>
      <P>The EPA chief made the announcement after a study by Fu Jen
Catholic University for the Ministry of Education found that 95
primary schools and 49 junior high schools in Taiwan are located
within 20 meters of high-voltage power lines, exposing more than
18,000 students to potentially unhealthy levels of exposure to
electromagnetic fields.</P>
      <P>Noting that the International Commission on Non-Ionizing
Radiation Protection had set the limit of human exposure to such
radiation at 833 milligauss, Chang said the level applied to a
maximum sustainable exposure within a short time, and therefore could
not be used as a safety standard for human health.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan must conduct an overall evaluation of the
issue to establish its own safety standard, and that to do so the EPA
must first determine the frequency of electromagnetic radiation that
is generated by the power supply network.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the EPA will ask Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) to
reduce the strength of electromagnetic fields by using existing
know-how, such as isolation methods and increasing the distance
between school classrooms and power lines. The EPA will also help
Taipower acquire more sophisticated technology to help resolve the
problems.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipower also indicated that it will conduct a series
of tests starting Feb. 15 in the 144 schools to ascertain whether its
high-voltage power lines near the schools are generating excessive
non-ionizing radiation that might pose a health risk.</P>
      <P>The dispute over health risks posed by high-voltage power lines
as been around for many years, with a growing number of studies
claiming that electromagnetic fields generated by power lines can
cause cancer and other health problems in children and adults living
nearby. However, other studies have argued there is little evidence
for such claims.</P>

      <P>St. Valentine's Day might be a sweet and
romantic occasion for many lovers, but doctors at a southern Taiwan
hospital cautioned Tuesday that the day's celebrations might be
followed by a wave of suicides.</P>
      <P>Psychiatrists of a mental health team at Tainan County's Jianan
Mental Hospital -- one of five public psychiatric hospitals operated
by the National Health Department -- said that people whose
expectations have not been met Feb. 14 should seek timely help or
purge themselves emotionally by means of writing a diary, chatting
with a friend, or even crying under a blanket.</P>
      <P>The psychiatrists said that seeking comfort through drinking is
virtually useless and suggested that exercise can help relieve
depression.</P>
      <P>Alternatively, they added, those who need help can call a suicide
prevention and crisis line (0800-788-995) set up by the Department of
Health that offers counselling 24 hours a day.</P>
      <P>St. Valentine's Day is traditionally the day on which lovers in
certain cultures let each other know about their love by sending
cards or gifts. The day is said to be in memory of St. Valentine, a
Roman who was martyred for refusing to give up Christianity. He died
Feb. 14, 269 A.D., leaving a farewell note for a jailer's daughter
who had become his friend, signed "Love From Your Valentine."</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) organized an
anti-corruption seminar Tuesday to find the most effective strategies
for strengthening integrity among government officials and fighting
corruption.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the seminar, MOJ Vice Minister Chu Nan noted that the
Transparency International (TI) and World Economic Forum (WEF) have
publicized the competitiveness and governmental integrity
classification of countries around the world each year. The ROC
government has paid much heed by instructing relevant agencies to

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HAS NOT IMPORTED CONTROVERSIAL JAPANESE HEALTH FOOD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  14  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Department of Health official said
Tuesday that no Taiwanese companies have imported a possibly
carcinogenic product called Brasil mushroom capsules produced by the
Japanese company Kirin.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Tung-ming, acting director of the DOH Bureau of Food
Sanitation, made the remarks after the Japanese government issued a
warning a day earlier that tests on rats show that the capsules made
by Kirin Well-Foods, a subsidiary of the Japanese beer company, are
likely to promote cancer. The Japanese government has ordered the
company to stop selling and to recall the product.</P>
      <P>Hsiao noted that although Taiwan Kirin has not imported the
product, consumers still can obtain it on-line and urged the public
not to eat it.</P>
      <P>As the mushrooms from Brasil are quite popular in Taiwan, as many
people believe that they can fight cancer, the Japanese government's
warning has caused much local concern.</P>
      <P>Noting that the available information still does not prove that
the Brasil mushroom itself contains the controversial elements or
whether the manufacturing process has been contaminated, Hsiao said
he has asked the Republic of China representative office in Japan to
collect more information.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA  `BLACK HOLE' IN EPIDEMIC PREVENTION: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 14 (CNA)
(By Debby Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian criticized China
Tuesday for being a "black hole" in global epidemic prevention and
said China is the biggest potential hot zone for a bird flu outbreak.</P>
      <P>But Chen also said there is no need for people in Taiwan to panic
and that as long as the public works with the government on epidemic
control, Taiwan can prevent a bird flu epidemic.</P>
      <P>"China's bird flu situation will seriously threaten the whole
world and since there is frequent traffic across the Taiwan Strait
among Hong Kong, Taiwan and China, it is Hong Kong and Taiwan that
will be the first to feel the impact," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said that since 2003, when severe acute respiratory syndrome
broke out in China, Beijing has been covering up vital information,
which makes China the biggest black hole in global epidemic
prevention.</P>
      <P>Chen made the statement Tuesday when he attended the opening
ceremony of the Health and Medical International Cooperation
Strategic Alliance. The alliance consists of Taiwan's International
Cooperation and Development Fund, Chang Gung University College of
Medicine and 27 Taiwan medical institutions.</P>
      <P>He said the alliance aims to fortify Taiwan's overseas medical
aid and combines medical resources from the private sector to provide
the international community with health care and medical aid. He said
that this will help Taiwan with its bid to join the World Health
Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan's medical missions first started to offer help
overseas in 1962, when Taiwan sent six military doctors into Libya to
help improve medical expertise there. He added that Taiwan's overseas
medical aid has been "approved by the international community."</P>
      <P>"Hopefully in the future, more people from Taiwan can participate
in overseas medical aid through the alliance and prove to the
international community that Taiwan is capable of playing a more
important role in the global village," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He further criticized China's suppression of Taiwan's efforts to
join the WHO and cooperate with the international community to handle
bird flu and other health issues.</P>
      <P>"Under China's heartless, ruthless and unreasonable suppression,
Taiwan has been faced with many serious challenges when trying to
participate in international health organizations and facilitate
international cooperation, including the nine times the country has
tried but failed to join the WHO," Chen said.</P>
      <P>"We will not give up attempting to participate in international
affairs and seeking to make contributions to mankind and the world, "
he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VP PROPOSES ESTABLISHMENT OF FEMALE POLITICIANS CLUB</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 14 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu proposed Tuesday
that a cross-partisan national female politicians club be established
to "bring together the power of women to deal with problems faced by
Taiwan society."</P>
      <P>Lu put forth the proposal during an informal gathering with a
group of female politicians including ruling Democratic Progressive
Party legislators Hsu Jung-shu, Kuan Bi-ling and Chen Hsiu-hui, as
well as city and county councilors and chiefs of townships and
villages.</P>
      <P>She noted that although it is a traditional expectation for women
to stay at home and raise families, 12 countries have had a woman
head of state and 11 others have had a woman minister of national
defense.</P>
      <P>Citing data from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization, Lu said Taiwan's women rank 20th in the world
in terms of political and social participation and achievements,
while their economic power is the 15th highest in the world and their
social status the highest in Asia.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan now faces several severe social problems, which
include negative population growth, low fertility, an ageing
population, a trend of not getting married or marrying late, and a
high divorce rate, Lu pointed out.</P>
      <P>According to the vice president, if a gender imbalance continues
in Taiwan, an estimated 400,000 Taiwanese men will have problems
finding a wife in the future, with one in every four couples expected
to be a combination of a Taiwanese husband and a foreign wife.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstance, the future presidents of Taiwan could
be the offspring of Vietnamese, Thai or Chinese, she said.</P>
      <P>Lu expressed hope that members of her proposed female politicians
club can meet every three months to exchange views on resolving these
social problems.</P>
      <P>The club members could also take a part in the Democratic Pacific
Union and join other outstanding women from the Pacific Rim region
for exchanges and seminars, she added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO FIXED TIMETABLE FOR CROSS-STRAIT UNIFICATION: KMT CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  Feb.  13 (CNA)
(By C.C. Huang and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou said in London Monday that his party has no "fixed
timetable" for Taiwan's unification with China, claiming that it is
not a pressing issue for either side.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan is already a fully fledged democracy, any changes to
the country's status quo must be approved by its people, Ma said in a
speech titled "Bridging The Divide: A Vision for Peace in East Asia"
at the London School of Economics and Political Science.</P>
      <P>To create favorable conditions for eventual unification between
Taiwan and China, Taiwan's status as a democratic political entity
must be fully respected and its equal partner status in cross-strait
negotiations under the "one China" framework fully recognized, Ma
said.</P>
      <P>This would create huge political challenges for both Taiwan and
China and this is why he urged both sides to resume negotiations,
he explained.</P>
      <P>As China is increasingly evolving into a more open and prosperous
society, Ma said that Taiwan's experience could serve as a
significant development reference for China, adding that it is time
for the two sides to build a new and constructive relationship and
engage in creating mutual benefits and prosperity.</P>
      <P>When the overall political, economic and social conditions on
both sides are matched, unification would be an option for Taiwan
people to consider, he said.</P>
      <P>But he pointed out that some political figures in Taiwan are
trying to pursue what he described as Taiwan's "split" by fanning an
arms races with China and fueling ethnic disputes at home. They are
also promoting a new constitution and seeking to whip up nationalist
resentment between the two sides in order to "sever" Taiwan's links
with China, he added.</P>
      <P>These moves will bring about a war across the strait that will
destroy Taiwan and hobble China's modernization efforts, he claimed.</P>
      <P>The United States and Japan would be dragged into such a
scenario, dealing a further blow to peace and stability in the region
and the rest of the world, he warned.</P>
      <P>Saying that it is vital for Taiwan to maintain its democracy and
free economy, he added that a secessionist ideology will never serve
that purpose. He called for conciliation between Taiwan and China
through negotiations to secure Taiwan's democracy and prosperity and
said that protecting the country's democratic achievements should not
linked to split-minded movement.</P>
      <P>Ma is currently on a six-day visit to London in his capacity as

The United States and Israel are discussing

Wall Street Journal: Rough Neighborhood,
Iran Plays Growing Role in Iraq,
Complicating Bush's Strategy

Iran's influence is most apparent in Iraqi 
politics, where a Shiite-dominated coalition 
has just nominated a prime minister with close 
ties to Tehran, but it also emerges in many areas
of Iraqi life that get less notice. Iranian 
businessmen are some of the largest investors 
in restoring Iraq's shattered infrastructure. 
Nonprofit groups from Iran are providing basic 
health services that crumbled in the chaos 
following the U.S.-led invasion. Iraq's Shiite 
media are getting training from experts across 
the border. While Tehran has little motive now
to throw Iraq into further turmoil, its
ability to do so could undermine the Bush
administration's attempt to stop Iran's nuclear
program.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>'PAN-GREEN CAMP' WILLFULLY TWISTS KMT'S CHINA POLICY PROPOSALS: KMT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 14 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>By summarizing opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's China policy proposals as "eventual
unification with China, " the "pan-green camp" of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) has "willfully twisted and simplified" the opposition party's
ideas about seeking peace and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait, a
senior KMT official claimed Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, director of the KMT Department of Mainland
Affairs, said Ma's recent remarks about cross-strait relations
focused on ways and means to maintain the status quo, seek peaceful
interaction and engage in mutually beneficial trade and economic
exchanges.</P>
      <P>On the subject of national sovereignty, Chang said the KMT has
been consistent in maintaining that there is only one China, whose
meaning both sides of the strait are free to interpret in their own
ways because the KMT wants to safeguard the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The KMT believes that based on the vague so-called "1992
consensus" about the meaning of "one China, " Taipei and Beijing can
re-open negotiations -- an effective way to maintain the status quo
and promote peace and prosperity across the strait, he added.</P>
      <P>However, Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu told the
media that both Ma and Lien Chan, the party's honorary chairman,
"have publicly accepted Beijing's one-China principle, that is,
accepted that Taiwan is part of China," Chang said.</P>
      <P>He said the DPP has been twisting the KMT's China policy
proposals and trying to exacerbate the controversy over unification
versus independence in a bid to divert people's attention from its
poor record in governing Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, from President Chen Shui-bian down, all DPP
members and their TSU allies equate the People's Republic of China
(PRC) with "China, " disregarding the fact that their own country is
called the ROC.</P>
      <P>While they attempt to smear the KMT as pro-communist, they have
also downgraded all organizations and institutions in Taiwan that
bear the name "China" to PRC bodies -- contrary to the striking fact
that the ROC is still alive and kicking, he said.</P>
      <P>"Their self-humiliating and enemy-aggrandizing act has achieved
only one result -- the DPP officials are scaring their own people and
thus making themselves a laughing stock," Chang claimed.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 14 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>American poet and singer Toni Blackman, one
of the most influential people in America's hip hop culture, is
visiting Taiwan as the "U.S. hip hop ambassador" with her group Hip
Hop Ensemble to give two free concerts and a lecture.</P>
      <P>The visit is a part of the American Music Abroad Program arranged
under the auspices of the U.S. Department of State in co-operation
with the Lincoln Center and the last leg of the group's Asia tour,
which has also included stops in Indonesia, the Philippines and
Thailand.</P>
      <P>"The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) is bringing the `American
hip hop ambassador' here to provide our Taiwan friends with a sample
of modern day American hip hop culture, " said Nicholas Papp,
Director of AIT's American Culture Center, which is organizing the
events.</P>
      <P>A Taipei concert will be held at the Taipei Metropolitan Hall
Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., while a Kaohsiung concert will take place at
the Sun Yat-sen Hall of the National Sun Yat-sen University,
Kaohsiung Thursday at 7:30 p.m.</P>
      <P>Known for her contagious stage presence, Blackman also published
her first book, "Inner-Course, " in 2003. She is highly respected as
the founder and director of Freestyle Union, a workshop that uses
freestyling as a tool to encourage social responsibility.
She has shared stage with famous artists such as Erykah Badu, Mos
Def, The Roots and Wu Tang Clan.</P>
      <P>Hip hop is a strong art form that extends to music, dance, poetry
and visual arts, Blackman said in a press conference Tuesday. "It is
not music, not DJ-ing, not rhyming. It's not beat, not windmill, not
12-inch vinyls, not 16-ounce cans of paint.
It's a feeling. It's within, " she said.</P>
      <P>Blackman encourages mainstream hip hop artists to shoulder more
social responsibility to help the younger generation build positive
perspectives on life.</P>
      <P>Hip hop is a unique American phenomenon and cultural movement
that originated in urban African American and Latino urban slums and
ghettos in the South Bronx borough of New York City in the early
1970s.</P>
      <P>The movement has the greatest impact on poor, young urban people
and on others who feel they live on the frayed margins of society.</P>

      <P>The dust-up over the formal appointment of
the legislature-approved members of the National Communications
Commission (NCC) will be settled by Friday, the legislative caucus of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) predicted Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Ker Chien-ming, who concurrently serves as the top DPP
caucus whip, made the remarks amid threats of retaliation from the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People
First Party (PFP) if the DPP administration drags its feet on the
appointment of NCC commissioners.</P>
      <P>"Premier Su Tseng-chang is determined to formally appoint the
legislature-approved NCC commissioners in accordance with the NCC
Organic Law if the Council of Grand Justices fails to respond by
Friday to the Cabinet's earlier request for an injunction suspending
the NCC establishment pending a ruling on the constitutionality of
the legislation," Ker said.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucuses of the KMT and the PFP, which between
them control a slim majority in the Legislative Yuan, threatened to
boycott Su's administrative report on the legislative floor next
Tuesday -- the inaugural day of the legislature's new session -- if
he fails to appoint the NCC members by Friday to allow for the
commission's formal establishment.</P>
      <P>With a view to breaking the political gridlock, Su announced his
determination to promote inter-party reconciliation and harmony upon
assuming the premiership late last month, and the NCC appointment is
widely seen an index move as to whether he looks likely to deliver on
this promise.</P>
      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh refused to appoint the 13 NCC
commissioners as soon as the legislature confirmed the list Jan. 12
in accordance with the NCC Organic Law that took effect Nov. 9 last
year.</P>
      <P>Hsieh's Cabinet asked the Council of Grand Justices (CGJ) Jan. 20
to interpret the constitutionality of the NCC Organic Law, claiming
that the law infringes upon the executive branch's constitutional
power and thus seriously damages the constitutional system. It also
requested the council to impose an injunction suspending the
establishment of the NCC pending a constitutionality ruling.</P>
      <P>On Feb. 10, the CGJ announced its acceptance of the Cabinet's
requests for a constitutionality ruling and an injunction of the law
pending its ruling.</P>

Kuomintang (KMT) , is currently on a six-day visit in London. He
delivered a speech, titled "Bridging the Divide: A Vision for Peace in
East Asia," to scores of British scholars, officials and students
at the prestigious school Monday.</P>
      <P>As Ma is believed to be the KMT's standard bearer for Taiwan's
next presidential election in 2008, the three Taiwanese groups --
reminded Ma in their joint statement that the status quo Taiwan wants
is to "remain a free and democratic nation, " not China's military
threat.</P>
      <P>The three groups -- the European Federation of Taiwanese
Associations, the European Federation of Taiwan Health Alliance and
the Taiwanese Women's Association in Europe -- also denounce the plea
to maintain the status quo in the Taiwan Strait because the status
quo continues to be altered by China with its ongoing military
buildup.</P>
      <P>"At this moment about 800 ballistic missiles are deployed aimed
at Taiwan. In March 2005, China's rubber-stamp legislature approved
its 'Anti-Secession Law' that 'legalizes' a military attack on Taiwan
in case Taiwan wants to remain a free and democratic nation. It is
clear that the Chinese belligerence contributes to instability in the
region, not democratic Taiwan which is under China's threat. We
demand that China immediately stop its military threat against the
people of Taiwan, " the statement said.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Taiwan is a free, sovereign, and democratic
country that elects its own leaders and government at all levels, the
statement stressed that Taiwan is not, nor has it ever been, apart of
communist China.</P>
      <P>"The anachronistic 'One China' policy that claims Taiwan a part
of China is a fiction. The attempt to fabricate another 'status quo'
that is 'neither unification nor independence' is not consistent with
the reality on the ground," the statement said. </P>
      <P>"As Taiwanese, " the statement went on, "we do not support any
paradigm or path built upon fictitious statements that are against
the desire of the people of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Noting that democracy is a peaceful process where the will and
wishes of the 23 million Taiwanese people prevail, despite different
identities and ideas, the statement said it is communist China that
needs to respect and be open to Taiwan 's democracy.</P>
      <P>The three groups also call upon the international community in
their joint statement to abandon the "One China" policy.</P>
      <P>"The antiquated policy conveys the wrong message to the Chinese
government and increases the risk of conflict in the Taiwan Strait.
It stands in the way of mutual recognition between China and Taiwan
and of peaceful dialogue. We believe that any serious attempt to
resolve the cross-Strait relationship has to reflect reality.
Pretending that Taiwan is not a full-fledged democratic sovereign
country is unrealistic and cannot and will not lead to any pragmatic
solution of cross-Strait relations."</P>

    <HEADLINE>NCC DISPUTE TO BE SETTLED FRIDAY: DPP CAUCUS(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The dust-up over the formal appointment of
the legislature-approved members of the National Communications
Commission (NCC) will be settled by Friday, the legislative caucus of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) predicted Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Ker Chien-ming, who concurrently serves as the top DPP
caucus whip, made the remarks amid threats of retaliation from the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People
First Party (PFP) if the DPP administration drags its feet on the
appointment of NCC commissioners.</P>
      <P>"Premier Su Tseng-chang is determined to formally appoint the
legislature-approved NCC commissioners in accordance with the NCC
Organic Law if the Council of Grand Justices fails to respond by
Friday to the Cabinet's earlier request for an injunction suspending
the NCC establishment pending a ruling on the constitutionality of
the legislation," Ker said.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucuses of the KMT and the PFP, which between
them control a slim majority in the Legislative Yuan, threatened to
boycott Su's administrative report on the legislative floor next
Tuesday -- the inaugural day of the legislature's new session -- if
he fails to appoint the NCC members by Friday to allow for the
commission's formal establishment.</P>
      <P>With a view to breaking the political gridlock, Su announced his
determination to promote inter-party reconciliation and harmony upon
assuming the premiership late last month, and the NCC appointment is
widely seen an index move as to whether he looks likely to deliver on
this promise.</P>
      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh refused to appoint the 13 NCC
commissioners as soon as the legislature confirmed the list Jan. 12
in accordance with the NCC Organic Law that took effect Nov. 9 last
year.</P>
      <P>Hsieh's Cabinet asked the Council of Grand Justices (CGJ) Jan. 20
to interpret the constitutionality of the NCC Organic Law, claiming
that the law infringes upon the executive branch's constitutional
power and thus seriously damages the constitutional system. It also
requested the council to impose an injunction suspending the
establishment of the NCC pending a constitutionality ruling.</P>
      <P>On Feb. 10, the CGJ announced its acceptance of the Cabinet's
requests for a constitutionality ruling and an injunction of the law
pending its ruling.</P>

      <P>Taiwan should use the Trade Policy Review
Mechanism of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to clarify the
country's trade policy towards China, experts said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The WTO's first policy review on Taiwan, which is scheduled for
June 20 and June 22, is expected to include Taiwan's policy of
restricting Chinese imports, a measure which has raised concerns that
it could be in violation of WTO rules.</P>
      <P>Under this circumstance, Taiwan's priority should be to explain
the issue fully in the government's policy statement to be presented
to the WTO, experts said.</P>
      <P>They noted that a policy statement drafted by the government of a
WTO member economy should mention its relations with major trading
partners.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Taiwan should not try to evade the issue by leaving
out China in the statement, they said.</P>
      <P>Fu Dong-cheng, director of the Department of Economic Affairs
under Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, said Monday in Taipei that
Taiwan restricts Chinese imports because Taiwan and China did not
conduct any bilateral talks before they were admitted to the WTO, a
situation which Fu said made it impossible for Taiwan to consider
whether WTO rules apply to cross-strait trade.</P>
      <P>Taiwan officials pointed out that since joining the WTO, the
country has taken the initiative to review its trade policy towards
China and requested bilateral talks with China, but the requests have
repeatedly been rejected by Beijing.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang instructed Wednesday
that related government agencies review and improve security measures
at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport in the wake of recent
incidents of in-bound passengers slipping through customs inspection.</P>
      <P>The premier gave the directive at an Executive Yuan meeting
during which Aviation Police Bureau chief Chen Tze-ching reported on
improving security measures at the airport.</P>
      <P>Security at the airport is crucial as it "projects the nation's
image, " Cheng Wen-tsang, the minister of the Government Information
Office, quoted the premier as saying.</P>
      <P>Su said he wants related government agencies to define clearly
the division of work and responsibility at the airport and to respond
quickly to emergencies to avoid any possible incidents.</P>
      <P>Noting that chaotic situations have often resulted from reporters
trying to cover news of foreign celebrities coming to visit Taiwan,
especially as some reporters have permission to move freely about the
airport, Su also called for improvements in this area.</P>
      <P>On Feb. 5, a passenger slipped through a customs inspection point
at the airport and walked quickly away from the scene despite an
order from a customs officer to stop for inspection.</P>
      <P>The customs officer proceeded to chase after the passenger to the
exit and then asked a police officer on duty to help intercept the
man, but the police officer replied that he was not supposed to leave
his post and allowed the man to get away, local news reports said.</P>
      <P>On Feb. 10, a Canadian man was found to be barred from entering
Taiwan because of overstaying his visa on his previous visit. While
being held at the aviation police office for more questioning, the
man ran out of the airport but was later intercepted.</P>

      <P>With 20 percent of foreign spouses of
Taiwan citizens being victims of domestic violence, the Ministry of
the Interior (MOI) will step up protection of this group of people.</P>
      <P>MOI officials said that the number of victims of domestic

foreign spouses of Taiwan citizens.</P>
      <P>As of December 2005, the number of foreign spouses of Taiwan
residents totaled 130,899, and it is estimated that foreign spouses
who are victims of domestic violence account for nearly 20 percent of
the total, far lower than the figure of 80 percent claimed by some
private civil groups, the officials said.</P>
      <P>In view of the situation, the officials said that they have
adopted several measures, including a public awareness campaign, to
step up protection of foreign spouses.</P>
      <P>The ministry has published manuals on domestic violence
prevention in Chinese, English, Indonesian, Thai and Vietnamese and
distributed them to overseas missions, missions of related countries
in Taiwan, the Immigration Bureau, as well as related social welfare

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHIEF STRUGGLES TO CLARIFY STANCE ON TAIWAN'S FUTURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Dublin,  Ireland,  Feb.  15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said in Dublin Wednesday that the KMT
advocates maintaining the political status quo across the Taiwan
Strait but media reports that the party sees independence as an
option for Taiwan's future is a misrepresentation.</P>
      <P>Ma, who arrived in the Irish capital early Wednesday morning on
the fourth-leg of his five-nation European visit, made the comments
when asked whether it's true that the KMT has for the first time
included "independence" as an option for Taiwan's future as stated in
a KMT advertisement run in the Liberty Times in Taipei the day
before. It could be the result of a "misreading or misinterpretation"
if the KMT has been considered as "pro-independence" because of the
advertisement, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma said that unification, independence and maintaining the status
quo are all options in terms of Taiwan's political future. As
citizens of a democratic country, the people of Taiwan are free to
choose which option to pursue, so long as the choices are
constitutional and do not violate any of the laws of the country, he
said.</P>
      <P>The KMT explained in Taipei Wednesday that the party will not opt
for independence though it respects all options.</P>
      <P>Ma, who also serves as Taipei mayor, made a six-day visit to
London prior to arriving in Dublin. While in the British capital, Ma
delivered a speech titled "Bridging the Divide: A Vision for Peace in
East Asia" to scores of British scholars, officials and students at
the prestigious London School of Economics and Political Science
Monday.</P>
      <P>In the speech, Ma said Taiwan's Constitution upholds "one China"
which refers to the Republic of China. Ma, who is widely expected to
be the KMT's standard bearer in Taiwan's next presidential election
in 2008, said that the KMT has not ruled out the possibility of
ultimate unification across the Taiwan Strait as one of the options
when the Chinese mainland evolves into a politically free, socially
equal and economically prosperous society like Taiwan is.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, Ma and his delegation met representatives from the
British business and industrial sectors at London's Four Seasons
Hotel for a workshop on the trade and investment climate in Taipei
City and Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Addressing the workshop, Ma urged British businesses to cooperate
with Taiwan people maintaining business operations in China to
jointly tap the huge and potentially-lucrative Chinese market. He
said Taiwan -- with its highly-skilled workforce, advanced
technologies and its people's seasoned experience in dealing with the
Chinese -- is the best gateway for British companies to expand into
China.</P>
      <P>Executives from nearly 50 big-name companies, including
GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceutical, Standard Charter Bank, the Jardine
Matheson Group, Smiths Aerospace, Mycom and Platic Logic, attended
the workshop.</P>
      <P>After visiting Dublin, Ma will head to Brussels, Belgium for the
last leg of his European visit, which has already taken him to Tulin,
Italy, Geneva, Switzerland and London.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THRSC COVERS UP SUBSIDENCE ISSUE: LAWMAKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  15 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC)
and responsible authorities are colluding in an attempt to cover up a
dangerous subsidence issue in central Taiwan's coastal area at the
expense of public safety, opposition lawmakers alleged Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Liu Wen-hsiung and Lee Hung-chun of the opposition People First
Party (PFP) urged the THSRC and the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) to learn a lesson from the freeway electronic
toll collection debacle and get a picture of what could happen to a
big project that is ill-prepared.</P>
      <P>Lee quoted a Water Resources Agency document as saying that in
the Yunlin, Chiayi and Tainan areas there are 1,162 legal wells,
whereas illegal ones number 15,839.</P>
      <P>Illegal tapping of underground water has been so rampant that the
PFP warned the MOTC and THSRC that between 1990 and 2000, the area
would suffer a one-meter subsidence. The warning fell on deaf ears,
so that another 13 cm of subsidence occurred from 1998 to 2001. Since
then, the ground level had fallen a further 11.6 cm as of the end of
last year, he said.</P>
      <P>Because the high-speed railway passes through this dangerous
area, Japan's Ashahi TV made a documentary report last November about
"why the THSRC could not launch passenger services, " he continued.</P>
      <P>Footage of the Japanese documentary showed that many bridge piers
supporting high speed rail tracks were submerged in ground seepage,
with obvious differences in the heights of the tracks and pier tables
at their joints, causing concern about the safety of fast-moving
trains on such tracks, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The documentary quoted former Shinkansen Trains Department
Director M. Saito as claiming that THSRC trains will "definitely
overturn if services are launched in a hurry." It further quoted a
Japanese contractor named K. Koto, whose company is responsible for
setting up the High Speed Rail's electrical and mechanical systems as
expressing concern that if no strengthening work is done, passengers
will face great danger, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>He urged the authorities to stop turning a blind eye to the
issue.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  14  (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian has tried to deepen Taiwanese identity in an attempt to
reverse cross-Taiwan Strait trends that seem to be in China's favor,
an American expert on cross-strait issues said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Alan D. Romberg, senior associate and director of the East Asia
Program at The Henry L. Stimson Center, made the comment in an
article titled "Recent Developments in Taiwan: Politics in Command?
But at What Cost?" that was released at the Pacific Forum of the
Center for Strategic and International Studies.</P>
      <P>At issue are Chen's Jan. 1 announcement of a more restrictive
approach to cross-strait economic relations and his Jan. 29 proposals
that Taiwan should seriously consider scrapping the National
Unification Council and the National Unification Guidelines, should
seek to join the United Nations under the name of Taiwan and should
draft a new constitution by the end of this year to be put to a
referendum in 2007.</P>
      <P>According to Romberg, these statements "appear to stem from
Chen's desire to regain the initiative from the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) " in the wake of his ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
defeats in the 2004 legislative elections and the 2005 local
elections.</P>
      <P>"He seeks to do this by tightening his identification with Taiwan
consciousness, heightening the impression of threat from the
mainland, deepening the sense of separateness, and tarring his
political opponents as capitulationist PRC toadies," Romberg said.</P>
      <P>Although there is unlikely to be a cross-strait crisis because
Chen lacks the wherewithal to carry out those proposals -- which
would take him across the lines drawn by China -- the steps mean that
there will be no significant progress in cross-strait relations
during his remaining two years in office, Romberg predicted.</P>
      <P>He noted that the bid to draft a new constitution is unlikely to
succeed in light of the firm objections by the KMT-led opposition
coalition, which controls the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Also, he said, Chen's proposal to seek U.N. membership under the
name of Taiwan has no prospects of going anywhere but is simply
designed to show that he is the true protector of Taiwan's interests.</P>
      <P>The proposal to consider abolishing the National Unification
Council and National Unification Guidelines is the most controversial
because it is the one that he might have the legal authority to bring
off on his own, Romberg said.</P>
      <P>While no abolition of the council and guidelines was one of the
"five noes" pledges that Chen made in his inaugural addresses in 2000
and 2004 under the precondition that China has no intention to use
military force against Taiwan, Chen now believes that the
precondition no longer exists, citing China's increasing missile
deployment targeting Taiwan, Beijing's enactment of the
Anti-Secession Law and the report that China has a three-phase plan
for war against Taiwan by 2015, Romberg pointed out.</P>
      <P>He said China's reaction to Chen's statements has been somewhat
detached and dismissive, but claimed that Beijing officials take
every private opportunity to warn the United States to remain
vigilant.</P>
      <P>In Washington's view, it is not justified for Chen to try to
break his pledges by exaggerating the threat from Beijing, he said.</P>
      <P>"The U.S. is not going to walk away from Taiwan. But it could
distance itself from Taipei if Chen continues to act in ways that not
only surprise Washington but move in directions seen as harmful to
U.S. national interests," he said.</P>
      <P>He said the United States strongly supports Taiwan's democratic
development and respects Taiwan's right to make its own choices.</P>
      <P>"But the U.S. is not bound to support such choices, and is free
to react in ways that serve its own interests," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO TALK WITH FETC OVER CHANGING ETC CONTRACT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  15 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Transport Kuo Yao-chi said
Wednesday that she will ask lawyers to talk with the Far East
Electronic Toll Collection Co. (FETC) over possible changes to its
contract to operate electronic toll collection on freeways.</P>
      <P>Kuo said she will ask FETC to increase the user rate to 4 percent
or face losing one ETC-dedicated lane in each direction at toll
stations.</P>
      <P>She made the remarks upon emerging from a Cabinet meeting during
which Premier Su Tseng-chang instructed the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) to address road users' fury
about the inconvenience of the service, the unreasonably high prices
of the service and heavy fines for rule-breakers.</P>
      <P>MOTC tallies show that five days after the launch of the service,
just 2.47 percent of cars were using ETC lanes. Broken down to
vehicle types, 4.55 percent of large trucks and buses were using the
service, while only 2.22 percent of small passenger cars -- the
majority of vehicles traveling on the freeways -- were using it.</P>
      <P>Kuo said the ministry's legal team will try to reach a deal with
FETC on changing provisions in the contract that deal with consumer
interests, hoping that the new contract will comply with the BOT
(build, operate and transfer) principle without damaging the
interests of either party.</P>
      <P>In response, FETC General Manager Chang Yung-chang said he will
"carefully evaluate" the MOTC proposals, which he said he believes
will benefit consumers, the government and his company.</P>
      <P>Both parties had agreed earlier that the 4 percent user rate
would be reached within three months of the launch of the service, or
by May 10. Now, however, FETC has been asked to reach that goal ahead
of schedule, possibly by the end of the this month.</P>
      <P>To better understand the public anger, she told her staff to
apply to install in all 15 of the MOTCs cars the on-board units
(OBUs) necessary to use the service. After five days, 14 cars have
successfully done so, with one still going through the laborious red
tape.</P>
      <P>Even the minister's limousine had to wait four days, with her
driver visiting the service station more than four times, to have one
OBU set up. Kuo said she has good reason to demand that FETC improve
its business efficiency.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT ACCUSES OPPOSITION LEADERS OF `SINGING DUET WITH CHINA'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Wednesday
criticized an opposition leader's warning about Taiwan seeking
"unilateral separatism, " claiming that it was "singing in tune with
China's rhetoric."</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while presiding over a ceremony to
commission five generals at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The president was referring to a speech made in London by main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman and Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou,
who is in Europe to solicit business opportunities, in which he
warned that "unilateral separatism" will be "the antidote that
invokes disaster" for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that Taiwan is in a traumatic period during
which it has deepened and solidified democracy and during which
diverse views have bloomed and conflicted with each other.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, China has continued to deploy missiles against
Taiwan and has adopted a carrot-and-stick approach toward the nation
with a view of obstructing the government's efforts to strengthen its
national security and cross-Taiwan Strait peace, said Chen.</P>
      <P>The public will never accept Ma's claim that the nation is
seeking "unilateral separatism" and will not accept listing
"unification with China" as the ultimate goal without the consent of
the 23 million people of Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>"For nearly six years since I first assumed the presidency in May
2000, I've extended olive branches to China more than 40 times, " he
said, urging both sides of the Taiwan Strait to establish a
"confidence-building mechanism" to avoid unwittingly sparking war, as
well as a "cross-strait exchange framework to promote peace and
stability."</P>
      <P>Nowadays, opposition leaders are making similar appeals, but they
have failed to see that the problem with cross-strait relations lies
with China's insistence on Taiwan accepting the "one China" principle
and that Taiwan is a province of China, Chen noted, adding "this is
a prerequisite that runs against the mainstream of
Taiwan democracy."</P>
      <P>The government "will not allow the country's sovereignty to be
compromised, its security to be threatened, and its future to be
decided by certain individuals or any single political party," Chen
stressed.</P>
      <P>In a speech delivered at the London School of Economics and
Policial Science Monday, Ma said Taiwan's Constitution upholds "one
China" which refers to the Republic of China and that if in the
future China becomes compatible with Taiwan in terms of its
political, economic and social development, the KMT would not rule
out "ultimate unification" as an option in cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>But Ma, a possible KMT contender for the 2008 presidency, also
said that the KMT is against any unilateral move to change the
cross-strait status quo and that any move toward unification must be
approved by the people of Taiwan, adding that the KMT has not set a
timetable for unification.</P>
      <P>He expressed disapproval for what he described as steps taken by
some of Taiwan's politicians to unilaterally separate Taiwan from
China. According to Ma, these steps include planning to draft a new
constitution, changing the official name of the country, putting into
place "desinicization" policies aimed at severing Taiwan's
connections with Chinese culture, provoking hatred toward China,
suppressing cross-strait exchanges and engaging in a cross-strait
arms race.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP TO OBSERVE KMT HEAD REGARDING `INDEPENDENCE OPTION'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  15 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) is willing to see main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou move toward Taiwan independence, but will need to observe
Ma to test his sincerity on the issue, DPP officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung and spokesman Tsai
Huang-liang made the remarks at a news conference in response to an
advertisement put up by the KMT in print media saying that the KMT
"will not rule out independence" as one of the options for the Taiwan
people when deciding their future.</P>
      <P>Lin said that he favors the KMT's policy adjustment toward what
he described as Taiwan's "mainstream public opinion" and the DPP's
pro-independence stance to secure Taiwan's maximum interests.</P>
      <P>If the KMT is sincere in listing Taiwan independence as an option
for Taiwan's future, Ma should not set unification as a precondition
or a conclusion regarding Taiwan's future course, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the development of cross-Taiwan Strait relations is
open ended and the KMT should throw its support behind President Chen
Shui-bian's proposal for scrapping the National Unification Council
(NUC) and its guidelines, Lin said, adding that it also must clarify
the "eventual unification" theory made last month by Ma to foreign
media.</P>
      <P>Lin urged the KMT to give a clear explanation of which "people"
Ma was referring to when he said Taiwan's future must be determined
by the people. The people Ma mentioned could be either Taiwan's 23
million or China's 1.3 billion, he said.</P>
      <P>The objective criteria to gauge Ma lies in whether the KMT
chairman and the party he leads will continue backing the plan of
scrapping the NUC and its guidelines, he said, claiming that
otherwise, the KMT ad is just a scheme to cheat voters in the run-up
to the 2008 presidential election and to mitigate the impact of his
"eventual unification" theory.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that Ma has displayed a little improvement regarding
Taiwan's sovereignty, but he contended that the KMT has to amend the
clauses promoting Taiwan's eventual unification with China contained
in its party platform.</P>
      <P>Echoing Tsai's view, DPP legislative caucus whip Chen Chin-jun,
prodded the KMT to take out the first article that envisions
"national unification" in its platform and to instead stipulate
Taiwan's status as an independent sovereignty and collaborate with
the DPP in dissolving the NUC.</P>
      <P>Chen also asked Ma to make it clear what he means by saying that
"Taiwan is an equal political partner under the 'one China'
principle."</P>
      <P>Recent remarks made by Ma, who visited London Feb. 10-14 in his
capacity as mayor of Taipei, have rippled the political arena at home
and have drawn flak from the independence-leaning "pan green camp" of
the DPP and the Taiwan Solidarity Union and from the People First
Party (PFP), a KMT partner in the opposition "pan blue alliance."</P>
      <P>PFP legislative caucus whip Daniel Y.C. Huang said his party does
not oppose independence or unification being listed as an option for
the Taiwan people, but he pointed out that Taiwan independence
remains a mission impossible under the present situation.</P>
      <P>Any attempts to change Taiwan's status quo, Huang said, must be
thoroughly assessed with "feasible" gauges and in line with the
international situation. The PFP insists on maintaining the status
quo and will not opt for Taiwan independence, he said.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chang Hsien-yau, who is also director of the PFP's
Central Policy Center, called a news conference later the same day to
rebut the KMT ad about an "independence option."</P>
      <P>Stressing that the KMT's remarks carry great risk that could
potentially ruin the status quo of the country just as scrapping NUC
would, Chang said the PFP will strongly object to the KMT's
pro-independence discourse and that he has asked ranking KMT
officials to clarify the party's stance.</P>
      <P>The nation's status and its future are a matter of top concern to
the public, something that no political party should be allowed to
sway between, he said, warning that the PFP-KMT partnership on
cross-strait policy could collapse should the KMT seek to take the
"independence option."</P>
      <P>If necessary, the PFP would be willing to have an open policy
debate with the KMT, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAJOR TAIWAN ECONOMIC ARCHITECT DIES AT 93by Deborah Kuo</HEADLINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P> CNA staff reporter</P>
      <P>Taipei, Feb. 15 (CNA) Former Premier Sun Yun-suan, widely known
as the major architect of Taiwan's economic and industrial
development, died early Wednesday morning. He was 93.</P>
      <P>The veteran technocrat-turned-premier died of heart and lung
failure as well as septicemic shock at Veterans General Hospital
after being in intensive care for 16 days.</P>
      <P>Sun, who was premier of the Republic of China from 1978 to 1984,
is considered the key man instrumental in bringing about Taiwan's
economic take-off in the 1980s. He helped usher Taiwan from an
agrarian society into an industrialized country, overseeing the
establishment of high-technology industries that in later years
became the backbone of Taiwan's economic development.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian, who visited Sun at his sickbed earlier
this month, paid him a formal visit shortly after his 2000
presidential inauguration and lauded Sun as one of the country's most
outstanding civil servants, saying he could have been president if
not for his health problems.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu visited Sun in early February, when Sun
was already in hospital. However, she did not enter his ward for fear
of disturbing him, only talking with Sun's family to inquire about
his condition.</P>
      <P>During their talk, the vice president recalled that she was
jailed during the period when Sun was serving as premier and that Sun
was instrumental in improving the treatment she received while
serving her sentence after learning that she had been an Executive
Yuan official.</P>
      <P>Sun's integrity and moral stature won him the respect of most
Taiwan people during his tenures as a minister and premier, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Sun is remembered mainly for being instrumental in promoting the
Ten Major Development Projects to reshape Taiwan industrially,
economically and socially. He is also saluted for initiating plans
for Taiwan's semiconductor manufacturing industry in his capacity as
the founding father of the Industrial Technology and Research
Institute, and for promoting Taiwan's export trade, which has been
the driving force behind Taiwan's economy for the past 30 years.</P>
      <P>Born in Penglai County of China's Shandong Province in 1913, Sun
began his public functionary career as an electrical engineer at a
government-run power station in Qinghai Province in 1940. He was
assigned to Taiwan in 1945 to take over the electricity system built
by the Japanese colonists in Taiwan, which was ravaged during World
War II. Sun managed to get 80 percent of the power-supply network
resumed in just five months, employing several hundred engineering
students from Taiwan and China working around the clock.</P>
      <P>That was the first "Sun miracle" -- as the Japanese did not
attach any hopes for post-war reconstruction in Taiwan, predicting
that "Taiwan was doomed to turn pitch-dark in three months."</P>
      <P>During his stint as minister of transportation, communications
and economic affairs, Sun initiated and pushed for various
development plans, allowing Taiwan to keep its head above water and
helping the island through oil crises and grow from rags to riches --
the second "Sun miracle."</P>
      <P>Sun took the Economics Ministry's helm in 1969, when the per
capita income in Taiwan was just US$320. By 1984, when he resigned
from the premiership after suffering his first stroke, Taiwan had a
per capita income nearing US$3,000.</P>
      <P>During the last couple of years of Sun's premiership, China
openly advocated the slogan "Learn from Taiwan, " evidently impressed
by Taiwan's flourishing economy and burgeoning high-technology
development.</P>
      <P>When Sun assumed office as premier in 1978, the Ten Major
Development Projects were nearing completion. It was at that time Sun
decided that Taiwan should strive to develop its own high technology
and consequently the "cradle" of Taiwan's hi-tech industrial
development, including the Industrial Technology and Research
Institute and the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park, were
established.</P>
      <P>In addition to infrastructure and high-tech development, Sun also
saw to it that Taiwan developed its export trade. Hence, many
manufacturing industries, including sugar-processing, banana
plantation and the textile and fabric industry, became Taiwan's top
foreign exchange earners, with their exports dominating world
markets.</P>
      <P>Sun's children said Sun was just like the late President Chiang
Ching-kuo in that both of them led spartan daily lives.</P>
      <P>Sun was strict in leading a healthy lifestyle himself and asked
others to do so. He was a staunch supporter of building Taiwan into a
smoke-free society -- he attended all anti-tobacco activities
sponsored by the John Tung Foundation, even after he became
wheelchair-bound after sustaining another stroke.</P>
      <P>Despite his illness, Sun remained a stalwart of the Kuomintang
(KMT), which lost power to the Democratic Progressive Party in 2000.
He attended Ma Ying-jeou's campaign activities in 1998 when Ma was
running for the Taipei mayorship representing the KMT.</P>
      <P>He won the hearts of the KMT audience when he managed to stand up
from his wheelchair on Ma's campaign stage, reducing Ma to tears.</P>
      <P>He was again in a KMT rally and on the KMT stage in his
wheelchair in March 2004, when the presidential ticket of Lien Chan
and James Soong, representing the opposition "pan blue alliance, "
lost the election by a razor-thin margin to President Chen Shui-bian
and Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>Upon his death, the legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party immediately offered its condolences to Sun's
family. DPP party whip Chen Chin-chun said Sun's contributions to the
country are unforgettable and his legacy provides Taiwan's offspring
with a good example to emulate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO TARGET FIVE GROUPS TO BOOST EMPLOYMENT: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In a bid to drive down the unemployment
rate to below 4 percent, the government will target five groups of
people for job promotion, the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The five groups are those who have lost their jobs due to changes
in industrial structure, youths, aborigines, middle-aged and the
elderly, and women who have to support families, officials from the
nation's highest economic planning agency said.</P>
      <P>Reporting on the results of job-promotion measures in 2005 and
plans for 2006 at an Executive Yuan meeting, the officials said the
average jobless rate was 4.13 percent in 2005, down 0.31 percent from
the previous year.</P>
      <P>In December 2005, the jobless rate was 3.86 percent, a five-year
single-month low. If no job-boosting measures had been taken in 2005,
it is estimated that the jobless rate would have been around 4.3
percent. In other words, related job-promotion measures effectively
cut the jobless rate for the whole year by 0.17 percent, they said.</P>
      <P>They pointed out that the goal of economic growth this year has
been set at 4.5 percent and for the jobless rate not to exceed 4
percent. To accomplish these goals, the council has compiled views
from various government agencies and made the five groups a priority
target.</P>
      <P>For people jobless due to industrial structure changes, the
officials said the government will continue to promote investment and
major construction projects. In addition, the Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA) will also promote a project to enhance the professional
skills of workers.</P>
      <P>On promoting the employment of aborigenes, the officials said
they expect to create 12,000 jobs, driving down the jobless rate
among aborigines to below 4.7 percent.</P>
      <P>The CLA and the Ministry of Economic Affairs will also be in
charge of providing multiple-channel job opportunities as well as
low-rate loans for starting small businesses for middle-aged and
elderly people, as well as for women who are the family breadwinner.</P>

      <P>A total of 229 runners from 27 countries will compete, while more

      <P>More than 50 million in Japanese yen
(US$451,335) was seized from a woman attempting to leave Taiwan while
carrying the undeclared cash last month, the Taipei Customs Office
reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The amount represented the largest sum ever confisticated in

violated the regulation that a passenger carrying more than US$10,000

      <P>Officials said the 60-year-old woman, surnamed Chen, was carrying
the 53 million yen in cash as she tried to leave for Tokyo at Chiang

      <P>The officers returned 1.16 million yen to her -- or the

Handling of Accident Creates Tension Between

The tension between President Bush's staff

with White House officials whispering to
reporters about how they tried to handle the
news of the shooting differently. Cheney's habit
of living in his own world in the Bush White

Wall Street Journal: Mixed Company, As young
Women Drink More, Alcohol Sales, Concerns Rise

British women are leading a rise in drinking
across the industrial world -- a trend that is
troubling public-health leaders and spurring
sales for the alcoholic beverage industry.
Although British women drink more than their 
counterparts elsewhere, the rest of the world, 
including the U.S., also has seen a big rise, 
according to consumer-goods research firm 
Datamonitor. Both British and American women 
between the legal drinking age and 24 drank 33
percent more alcoholic drinks by volume in 2004

    <TEXT>
      <P>Entering the debate over the best
alternatives regarding Taiwan's future, People First Pary (PFP)
Chairman James Soong said Wednesday that the Republic of China was
the only option.</P>
      <P>The PFP would opt for maintaining the status quo -- the status
quo of the de facto existence of the ROC, and the status quo of
freedom and democracy, he said.</P>
      <P>Recalling his consensus reached with President Chen Shui-bian in
February last year, Soong said the ROC was the lowest common
denominator for all parties in Taiwan, and therefore he would make it
a point to again declare that "the ROC is our only option."</P>
      <P>Echoing Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, Soong said that
the social, economic and political conditions for immediate
unification of Taiwan with China did not exist.</P>
      <P>"Nor does Taiwan have the necessity or the capital to declare
independence, " he said, adding that only by maintaining the status
quo would Taiwan ensure its own interests and meet the expectations
of the international community.</P>
      <P>Currently, Soong said, neither the people on both sides of the
Strait nor the international community were asking Taiwan to make an
immediate choice about its future.</P>
      <P>He warned that if independence was an option for Taiwan, it would
give legitimacy to the president's proposal to dissolve the National

      <P>Air France-KLM is planning to apply for
permission from China in preparation for opening new non-stop flights
from Holland to Taiwan via flying over Chinese airspace, an executive
for the airline in charge of the Taiwan market said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>At present, Air France-KLM, the largest carrier in Europe,
operates a daily round-trip Amsterdam-Taipei flight with a stop in
Bangkok.</P>
      <P>Speaking at an informal meeting with local reporters, Johnson
Wan, the airline's Taiwan branch manager, said Air France-KLM plans
to operate new direct flights between Holland and Taiwan via flying
over Chinese airspace. </P>
      <P>By operating new Holland-Taiwan flights via China, Wan said the
airline is setting its target on the many China-based Taiwan
businessmen who still retain their research and development
operations in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition to traveling between Taiwan and China, some Taiwan
businessmen also have to attend frequent meetings in Europe, Wan
said, adding that KLM is also mulling cooperation with Dragon Air to
offer a combination of tickets for those flying between Taiwan, China
and Europe.</P>
      <P>The planned service will allow Taiwan businessmen to depart for
China, then proceed to Europe and return to Taiwan on a single
ticket, which will be more economical than buying separate tickets
for each leg, he explained, adding that Air France-KLM is optimistic
about business on direct routes between Taiwan and Holland based on
its lucrative operations in the Asian market.</P>
      <P>Air France and KLM merged into Air France-KLM in May 2004,

(By Taijing  Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A survey released on Wednesday by Amway
Taiwan Company, a leading direct-selling company, found that 66
percent of the people in Taiwan lack a sense of fulfilment in their
job while more than 50 percent are unhappy about their life but felt
incapable of changing it.</P>
      <P>Wu, Chyi-in, an Associate Research Fellow at the Academia
Sinica's Institute of Sociology, said the statistics may be a warning
signal that reflects the mentality of working-class people, but it
could not represent the whole of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>There are too many factors that may have influenced the results
of this survey, Wu noted, but it certainly in part reflects the
truth. Such results were definitely not positive and may require
further research, said Wu.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by street interview on 500 respondents
between 20 and 59 years of age in Taipei, Taichung and Kaohsiung from
Jan. 6 to Jan. 9 with a margin of error of 4.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Slightly over 42 percent of those surveyed said "family life" was
the most important thing for them, while 40.6 percent said "working"
was most important. Also, 36 percent thought that "learning and
growth" was "less important" and 34 percent believed that "intimate
life" came after family and work.</P>
      <P>In the survey, respondents living in Kaohsiung appeared to be the
most satisfied with both their job and family situation. However,
those residing in Taipei and Taichung felt guilty toward their family
although they gained more satisfaction from their job.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  15 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
fined United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) NT$5 million (US$155,000)
Wednesday for investing in China's Hejian Technology Corp. without a
permit, the first punishment meted out to a Taiwanese business since
President Chen Shui-bian announced his "active management, effective
opening" policy last month.</P>
      <P>Hsinchu district prosecutors have indicted former UMC chairman
Robert Tsao and other senior executives on charges of breaking the
business accounting law and other offenses.</P>
      <P>Based on indictment documents and interviews with Tsao and other
UMC executives, MOEA said it was fining the company for violating the
Statute Governing the Relations between Peoples of the Taiwan Area
and the Mainland Area, and the Regulations Governing Permission of
Trade Between Taiwan Area and Mainland Area.</P>
      <P>The Ministry's Investment Commission said that since 2001, UMC
has assisted in the design, construction and installation of
production equipment and in the management of Hejian, which agreed to
give UMC 15 percent of its shares in return -- estimated at US$1.1
billion at market price.</P>
      <P>The ministry said NT$5 million was the maximum amount allowed by
law, which had been later revised to NT$25 million. It said it was
fining UMC NT$5 million according to the law applicable at the time
of the company's "illegal behavior."</P>
      <P>MOEA did not initiate any punitive actions toward Tsao and his
colleagues because, according to Investment Commission executive
secretary Huang Ching-tang, it did not have any solid evidence of
those individuals investing in Hejian Corp.</P>
      <P>UMC may appeal the MOEA decision. MOEA said it would keep
cracking down on Taiwanese investors who violate the law and the
government's rules.</P>

    <HEADLINE>228 INCIDENT MUST NOT BE FORGOTTEN: PRO-INDEPENDENCE ACTIVISTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  15  (CNA)
(By Debby Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwanese should refresh their
knowledge about the 228 Incident so as to prevent the tragedy from
ever happening again, pro-Taiwan independence activists said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"We should reconsider how to best pay tribute to the 228
Incident. As Taiwan's children and masters, our greatest hope is that
this tragedy will never happen again. We will refresh our knowledge
of the 228 Incident and prevent it from happening again by figuring
out who was really to blame, " 228 Incident Memorial Foundation
Chairman Chen Chin-huang said.</P>
      <P>The foundation is set to release a new book, titled "A Research
Report On Those Responsible for the 228 Incident," on Feb. 19.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident refers to a series of events in 1947 that led to
a brutal crackdown by the then-Kuomintang (KMT) government against
the local population, particularly the intelligentsia.</P>
      <P>"The person who should be blamed most for the 228 Incident is
[the late President] Chiang Kai-shek. He had the political and
military power, and he was the one in a position to decide to send
the military to Taiwan and open fire, " Academia Historica president
Chang Yen-hsien said, giving a sneak preview of the new book. He
directed the research task force for the work.</P>
      <P>Chang said the foundation published the book out of respect for
the families of the "228" victims, who wanted to get to the
historical truth of the incident, and to know the identities of those
responsible.</P>
      <P>"Because of the [recent political] appeal for harmony, the 228
Incident has been forgotten. We can strive for harmony but we cannot
twist the truth of the incident. Otherwise those who were shot in the
incident cannot have their justice back," Chang said.</P>
      <P>A similar sentiment was echoed by Examination Yuan President Yao
Jia-wen and Hand-In-Hand To Save Taiwan Alliance executive convener
Ng Chiau-tong. Yao said the most important lesson from the 228
Incident was that Taiwan needs to be a new country and not governed
by others, while Ng said that if Taiwan was governed by China, a new
228 Incident would occur.</P>
      <P>The foundation and the alliance are working together to hold a
series of events this year to commemorate the 228 Incident. Besides
the book, there will be a week-long photography exhibition of the 228
Hand-in-Hand rally of 2004 from Feb. 21-28.</P>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui will give a speech on his vision
for Taiwan's future as a nation Feb. 27, and there will also be
musical concerts featuring Taiwanese folk singers.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident took place in a turbulent period of Taiwan's
history. In 1945, the mainland China-based KMT government reclaimed
Taiwan, which had been a Japanese colony. But the KMT's rule was
brutal and corrupt, leading to a massive protest Feb. 28, 1947, by
the native Taiwanese. More troops were sent from the mainland to
crush the demonstrations and in the following months, soldiers
arrested and killed thousands of people they claimed were communists
or saboteurs trying to overthrow the government.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In response to opposition lawmakers'
allegations that a land subsidence in central Taiwan's coastal area
was raising questions about high-speed train safety, Taiwan High
Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) said Wednesday that an assessment of the
geological changes in the area indicated the issue did not warrant
such concern.</P>
      <P>In a press release, THSRC said it set up a monitoring system in
2003, which has not found any figures or statistics that would raise
concern about the safety of the railway's structure.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) said the
Executive Yuan told the Water Resources Agency to shut down all
wells by year-end which might cause further subsidence in Yunlin,
Chiayi and Tainan counties.</P>
      <P>Ho Yuan-hsuan, an MOTC deputy minister, said an average of
four centimeters of subsidence and 14 cm in "differential" subsidence
are acceptable per year. However, in order to ensure public safety,
the government has ordered the closing of any deep wells that might
cause land to subside.</P>
      <P>He noted that shutting down deep wells does not mean that
subsidence will no longer occur, but that it would slow down until it
finally stopped. For example, he said, similar measures had been
taken in Taipei, where subsidence is expected to stop five years from
now.</P>

city and county councilors around the country are set to elect among
themselves speakers and deputy speakers of local councils March 1.</P>
      <P>"The upcoming elections mark the first time the newly revised
Public Officials Election and Recall Act will be applied," Yen said.</P>
      <P>The revised law, which was passed last year, includes harsh
penalties for those convicted of vote-buying charges in the elections
for city/county council speakers and deputy speakers.</P>
      <P>In the past, such offenses were punishable in accordance with
Articles 143 and 144 with the maximum penalty of five years in
prison.</P>
      <P>The relatively lenient punishment failed to deter monied
influences in local council speaker and deputy speaker elections.
Vote-buying cases were frequently reported during previous elections.</P>
      <P>With a view to clean up politics and wipe out official
corruption, the Public Officials Election and Recall Act was amended

money in exchange for votes and those who ask for money in exchange

Victor J. Chin, the nation's representative to New Zealand, was

    <HEADLINE>MINISTER NIXES SUGGESTION TO OPEN ETC LANES TO ALL VEHICLES ON HOLIDAYS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.   16   (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Transportation and
Communications Kuo Yao-chi said Thursday that it is not a feasible
option to open electronic toll collection (ETC) lanes to vehicles
without an onboard unit installed during holidays.</P>
      <P>Kuo was responding to an appeal by the Consumers' Foundation that
the lanes be open to all vehicles in order to ease the current
congestion in other lanes at freeway toll collection stations.</P>
      <P>"The ministry has studied the option and found it not to be
feasible," Kuo said.</P>
      <P>She said that if the ETC-exclusive lanes are open to all
vehicles, this could result in further chaos and confusion.</P>
      <P>Since the formal launch of the ETC system on Feb. 10, public
discontent has risen only higher because of the traffic congestion,
which is mainly due to the fact that currently, only a limited number
of vehicles are installed with the onboard units while a majority of 
vehicle owners are adopting a wait-and-see attitude to try to drive
down the installation fee.</P>
      <P>The Consumers' Foundation urged earlier the same day in a press
conference that the ETC-exclusive lanes be open to other vehicles on
holidays.</P>
      <P>Foundation Chairman Jason Lee pointed out that there are
relatively few vehicles installed with the onboard units needed to
use the two ETC lanes at toll stations and that most vehicles on the
road are forced to use the other four to seven lanes at the toll
collection stations.</P>
      <P>"With heavy traffic on holidays, a freeway could just turn into a
big parking lot," he said.</P>
      <P>The foundation is setting up a public forum at its Web site
www.consumers.org.tw to solicit the views of the public so as to use
them as a reference for the government, he added.</P>
      <P>News reports have said that the MOTC is planning to talk with the
Far East Electronic Toll Collection Co. (FETC) about possible changes
to its contract to operate the electronic toll collection system on
freeways.</P>
      <P>The MOTC will also ask the FETC to work to increase the ETC-only
lanes' user rate to 4 percent at all toll stations within three
months or face losing one ETC-dedicated lane in each direction at toll
stations after three months.</P>
      <P>Statistics from the Taiwan Area National Expressway Bureau under
the MOTC show that six days after the launch of the service, 3.47
percent of vehicles were using the ETC lanes. By vehicle type, the
figures showed that 7.44 percent of large trucks and buses were using
the system, while only 2.56 percent of small passenger cars -- the
majority of vehicles traveling on the freeways -- were using it.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT RECEIVES OVER 1,000 LETTERS FOR TAIWAN'S U.N. BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
he has received more than 1,000 letters from the public in support of
the idea of applying to join the United Nations under the name of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he believes the move will be a very important
symbol of his government's policy to deepen Taiwanese identity and
that he appreciates the encouragement that the public has offered
him.</P>
      <P>During a Lunar New Year's Day gathering with supporters in Tainan
County, Chen proposed that the country should seriously consider
applying to the U.N. under the name of Taiwan and abolishing the
National Unification Council and National Unification Guidelines. He
also renewed a call to draft a new constitution by the end of this
year to be put for a referendum in 2007.</P>
      <P>In the wake of Chen's speech, the Taiwan United Nations Alliance,
a pro-independence lobbying group, has launched a "one letter per
person" campaign inviting the public to write to urge the president
to move courageously to file an application with the U.N. under the
name of Taiwan during the remaining two years of his term.</P>
      <P>The letter says that Taiwan should exhibit to the international
community that Taiwan is a sovereign state independent of China and
show its resolve to uphold justice and peace across the Taiwan
Strait, following Beijing's enactment of its Anti-Secession Law last
year aimed at legitimizing the use of force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's application is bound to be vetoed by China's
representative to the U.N. Security Council, this will expose
Beijing's hegemonic ambition to annex Taiwan and expand its
territorial boundaries, which will jeopardize peace and stability in
the Asia-Pacific region, the letter says.</P>

    <DATELINE>Panama  City,  Feb.  15 (CNA)
(By Ramon Huang and Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China donated 50
fishing nets that meet international standards to the Panamanian
government Wednesday to help the Central American country's fishermen
to safeguard marine ecology and engage in sustainable fishing
practices.</P>
      <P>The donation was presented by ROC Ambassador to Panama Hou
Ping-fu to Panamanian Second Vice President Ruben Arosemena Valdes in
a ceremony held in Panama City.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan's technical mission officials stationed in
Panama, the local fishermen usually use fishing nets which don't meet
international standards. The continued use of such nets, in which are
caught many young and small fish, is expected to deplete fishing
resources in waters off some of Panama's provinces in the not too
distance future, they said.</P>
      <P>The internationally standard nets provided by the ROC will help
Panamanian fishermen reduce the amount of "bycatch, " namely the
unintended killing of marine organisms by fishing nets or lines.</P>
      <P>Arosemena expressed gratitude to the ROC technical mission for
its assistance in Panama's fishing industry development project,
saying that the donation of the nets will help the nation in its
efforts to sustain its marine resources.</P>
      <P>In addition to the donation, Hou said the ROC government is also
planning to invite agricultural vice ministers of Central American
countries and the Dominican Republic to visit Taiwan in May to gain a
better understanding of the country's aquaculture techniques, and to
provide US$3 million in funds to help these countries in this regard.</P>

communication, he had clarified the KMT's stance Wednesday to an
official of the Taiwan Affairs Office under the Beijing-based State
Council, and that the Beijing official had gained a full
understanding of the matter.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the Beijing official did not voice any "strong
dissatisfaction" as local media had reported, adding that he had also
received many inquiries from foreign media.</P>
      <P>But Chang was reluctant to reveal the ranking of the Beijing
official, only describing him as a "representative" figure who is
"very familiar about the KMT and Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Chang reiterated that the KMT -- including its Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou and honorary chairman Lien Chan -- is firmly opposed to
Taiwan independence, which he said was "only an option advocated by a
small number of Taiwanese people."</P>
      <P>But the KMT respects the pro-independence option and this is the
spirit of Taiwan's democratic system, he said.</P>
      <P>Controversy has been whipped up by the KMT ad in the
pro-independence Liberty Times Tuesday saying that the party "will
not rule out independence" as one possible option for the nation's
future.</P>
      <P>Local media reported that Beijing expressed grave concern
Wednesday morning about the KMT's motive for running the ad and asked
the KMT to clarify the issue.</P>
      <P>Pan Wei-kang, a KMT legislative caucus whip, stressed that
independence is only an option for the Taiwan people but not for the
KMT.</P>
      <P>"The KMT has never deviated from its anti-independence stance and
insists that the status quo of the Republic of China must be
maintained," she stressed and asked the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party to refrain from confounding the issue.</P>
      <P>David Huang, legislative caucus whip of the Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) , blasted the KMT for downgrading itself to a CPC
subsidiary, saying the KMT had fallen under the CPC's spell.</P>
      <P>Huang accused China of meddling in Taiwan's internal affairs and
criticized the KMT as "sowing the wind and reaping the whirlwind" for
having arranged a meeting between former KMT Chairman Lien and CPC
General Secretary Hu Jintao in the spring of last year. Since then,
the KMT has repeatedly shown its true colors by seeking to align
itself with the CPC against Taiwan, he claimed.</P>
      <P>Huang said he suspected the KMT is really hoping to list
independence as an option for Taiwan and is skeptical of Ma's recent
remarks. He argued that the KMT's deference toward Beijing has not
helped create any advantages -- for Taiwan nor for itself -- and
urged the KMT to support Taiwan's independence as the future path of
the nation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's direct selling industry is
expected to post a growth rate of 30 percent this year, despite
competition from other retail businesses, a leading direct selling
company said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to Amway Taiwan, the market scale of Taiwan's
multi-level network marketing amounted to NT$68.3 billion (US$2.1
billion) in 2004, up 30 percent over the previous year.</P>
      <P>As the amount is only slightly higher than the annual sales of
the Pacific SOGO Department Store, the direct selling market is
expected to have a very high potential and continue to expand,
officials at the company said.</P>
      <P>They noted that health food and skin-care products are the two
main product lines fielded by Taiwan's direct selling industry,
with the two categories together accounting for more than 60 percent
of total sales.</P>
      <P>They said Amway Taiwan posted sales of NT$6.57 billion in 2005,
28 percent higher than 2004, and that the company was aiming to
boost that amount to top NT$7 billion in 2006.</P>
      <P>They expressed confidence that the direct selling businesses will
be able to recruit more members, in light of the low requirements and
risks involved in the business.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INDIA, BANGLADESH GATEWAY FOR TAIWAN TO ENTER SOUTH ASIAN MARKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Debby Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's businesses may in future use India
and Bangladesh as a springboard for entering the trade network of
member countries of the South Asian Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA) and
expanding business there, an expert said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's businesses can use 'made in India' and 'made in
Bangladesh' products to expand business throughout SAFTA member
countries, while enjoying lower tariffs, or zero tariffs. Since
Taiwan is not a member of any trade zone, it can enter other markets
via India and Bangladesh, " said, Wu Fu-cheng, deputy director of the
Taiwan Institute of Economic Research Division of International
Affairs.</P>
      <P>Wu pointed out that since SAFTA took effect Jan. 1, 2006,
entering the South Asian market will allow Taiwanese businesses to
enjoy favorable treatment.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan can also use India's free-trade agreement with other
countries to enjoy reduced tariffs, or zero tariffs. After India
signs a free-trade agreement with the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) , Taiwan can avoid being marginalized by increasing
export opportunities to ASEAN markets via India," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu made the statement during a seminar on investment in India and
Bangladesh sponsored by the Taiwan External Trade Development Council
(TAITRA) . TAITRA has held a series of seminars to assist and
encourage Taiwan businesses with an interest in expanding trade ties
with India and Bangladesh.</P>
      <P>"We can use India to balance out the lean of Taiwanese businesses
toward China, yet we cannot try to use India to contain China, since
India and China are not fighting against each other anymore, but are
now cooperating and competing with each other," Wu said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's businesses can also use their base in China to enter
India," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu supported the case of investment in India by saying that even
U.S. leading distributor Wal-mart is considering the transfer of its
textile and clothing merchandising center from China to India due to
gains made by the Renminbi. Wu said this showed that products that
are 'made in China' can be replaced by ones that are 'made in India.'</P>
      <P>Wu pointed out that since Taiwanese businesses are unfamiliar
with the Indian market, they can try to enter it via Singapore, as
the two countries share a long history of trade relations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been trying to expand its investment in India as a new
private organization, Taiwan-India Cooperation Council, was
established Feb. 11 to strengthen Taiwan-India ties. The council,
headed by ruling Democratic Progressive Party chairman Yu Shyi-kun,
is aimed at strengthening economic, trade, legislative, artistic and
cultural ties between Taiwan and India.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang will
lead a trade mission of Taiwanese entrepreneurs on a visit to India
and Bangladesh in May to further explore investment opportunities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET MAY APPOINT 12 NCC MEMBERS BEFORE FEB. 21</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb.  16  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet is likely to appoint 12
nominees approved by the legislature to serve as members of the
National Communications Commission (NCC) before the legislature opens
a new session Jan. 21, Hsu Chih-hsiung, a minister without portfolio,
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hsu explained the Cabinet would make the appointments under the
condition that the Council of Grand Justices ruled against the
Cabinet's argument that the law providing for the establishment of
the NCC has infringed upon the constitutional powers of the executive
branch.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet, under former Premier Frank Hsieh, made the request
to the council to determine whether the Organic Law providing for the
NCC's establishment was unconstitutional. The council is deliberating
the issue at a three-day meeting starting Feb. 15 and will announce
its results March 8, although the majority view of the grand justices
should become clear by Feb. 17.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office chief Cheng Wen-tsan also confirmed
Thursday that the Cabinet would not rule out the possibility of
formally appointing the 12 NCC members if it became clear that the
grand justices considered it unnecessary to impose an injunction on
the establishment of the NCC.</P>
      <P>Pan Wei-kang, a whip of the legislative caucus of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) , urged the grand justices not to become an
"accomplice" of the Cabinet in "violating the law and abusing its
power."</P>
      <P>Pan also called on Premier Su Tseng-chang to demonstrate "a
minimum amount of goodwill" to the legislature by appointing the 12
NCC members. Otherwise, she added, the legislative caucuses of the
KMT and its ally, the People First Party (PFP), would take drastic
actions against the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Pan did not elaborate on what actions the KMT legislative caucus
might take in retaliation, but PFP caucus convener Huang Yi-chiao
warned that if the NCC members were not appointed before the
legislature opens Feb. 21, the PFP caucus would do whatever was
necessary to prevent the premier from delivering his administrative
report to the legislature.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucuses of the KMT and PFP jointly hold a slight
majority in the 211-seat legislature.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The unemployment rate of aboriginal
people was 4.36 percent in 2005, down 1.14 percent from the original
estimate of 5.5 percent, an official of the Council of Indigenous
Peoples (CIP) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chei Ming-hsi, director of the CIP's Health Welfare Department,
said the figures indicated the aboriginal employment situation
has improved and predicted this year's figure could be even
better.</P>
      <P>Chei said that to solve the problem of a higher jobless rate among
aborigines than other groups, the CIP has cooperated with the
Council for Economic Planning and Development since 2005 on a project
designed to boost job opportunities for aboriginals.</P>
      <P>The council had previously predicted the unemployment rate
would be cut to 5.5 percent in 2005, 4.7 percent in 2006, and 4.1
percent in 2007, but Chei said that the result in 2005 was even
better than expected.</P>
      <P>He noted the unemployment rate among aboriginals was 5.76 percent
in 2004, compared with 4.41 percent for non-aboriginals; and 4.36
percent in 2005, compared with 3.86 for non-aboriginals.</P>
      <P>Noting that short-term measures would only provide temporary
relief for the aboriginal community, he advocated a long-term
solution that would see the creation of legislation to protect the
working rights of aboriginals, so that the ratio of aboriginal
employment in government agencies, public schools, state-owned
enterprises, private schools, groups or private enterprises would be
in line with that of the physically or mentally challenged.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  16 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A pension reform program took effect
Thursday, with the expectation that an estimated 16,000 retired civil
servants and some 64,000 near retirement will be affected by the new
pension system, officials from the Ministry of Civil Service (MOCS)
under the Examination Yuan said.</P>
      <P>The MOCS has published pamphlets and has provided a calculating
function on its Web site to allow civil servants to better understand
the new pension system, the officials said</P>
      <P>The pension reform, which was unveiled shortly before last
December's local elections, is aimed at changing the anomaly whereby
the monthly pensions of some retired civil servants, military
personnel and teachers are more than the salaries of those still
working, due to an 18-percent preferencial deposit interest rate for
retirees.</P>
      <P>The reform program has encountered tremendous objections by some
civil servants, military personnel and teachers, who have argued that
the policy would affect their livelihood.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian entered the debate to explain the policy
by saying that its objective was to achieve social justice.</P>
      <P>Yao Chia-wen, president of the Examination Yuan, which supervises
the MOCS, said under the new program, pension payments for retired
civil servants should not exceed 85 percent -- or at most 95 percent
-- of the salary they were receiving at the time of retirement.</P>
      <P>The 85-to-95 percent income rate is still the highest in the
world for retired civil servants, Yao added.</P>
      <P>According to Yao, the new pension program forms part of President
Chen's major reform plans.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will continue promoting renewable
energy to maintain a clean environment while developing its economy,
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The officials of the MOEA's Bureau of Energy made the remarks at
the first anniversary of the Kyoto Protocol, under which the
signatories are committed to meeting greenhouse gas emissions targets
by 2012.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is not a signatory to the agreement, the country
convened last June a national energy conference to map out measures
to reduce the country's greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      <P>During the last year, the bureau has been promoting renewable
energy such as hydro, wind, geothermal, solar and biomass power, and
has set up technical groups to offer consulting services in
energy-reducing to industrial and trade organizations, as well as to
government agencies, the officials said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the bureau has also set energy-reduction targets and
improvement projects for big energy users, and has been promoting the

      <P>Taichung City, which has been given the
lowest satisfaction rate in terms of public safety among all Taiwan's
cities for many years, is showing considerable improvement in cutting
down crime, Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Without giving statistics to back his claim, Hu described the
extent of Taichung's improvement in public safety as "obvious" and
noted that polls show that more than 50 percent of Taichung's
residents are aware of the progress.</P>
      <P>He admitted that Taichung residents are still not satisfied with
the achievement and pledged that the city government will continue to
push for more progress.</P>
      <P>Hu said the deterioration of Taichung's public safety was not
something that occurred in the past three years but that the city has
been notorious for its lack of safety in the past decade, mainly
because of "media publicity" and a shortage of police.</P>
      <P>He claimed that more than 50 percent of the crimes in the city
are committed by people who are not residents of Taichung.</P>
      <P>As a countermeasure, the Taichung city government has decided to
earmark NT$20 million to set up closed-circuit cameras on roads
bordering the city to discourage crime. The money will be in addition
to NT$60 million that will be spent on setting up such cameras on
every street within the city, according to Hu.</P>
      <P>The city government also plans to recruit an additional 500
police officers to supplement the existing 2,500 officers by the end
of this year. If conditions permit, the city government hopes to
increase the police force by 500 every year in the next four years,

      <P>Taiwan Advocates -- a private thinktank
dedicated to Taiwan's independence -- is slated to hold an economic
development conference in mid-March to develop strategies on creating
outlets for Taiwan's economy, Taiwan Advocates Vice Chairman Huang
Kun-huei announced Thursday at a news conference.</P>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui, the founder and mastermind of
Taiwan Advocates, places great importance on the conference and
keenly hopes that people from diverse specializations will
participate in the meeting March 18-19 to examine the future of the
nation's economy, Huang said -- in particular Taiwan's trade and
economic relations with China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Advocates hopes to attract private individuals, scholars,
experts and representatives of small businesses and minority groups
to discuss topics focusing on cross-strait economic relations and
developing a winning strategy for Taiwan amid globalization and
unemployment in the conference, he said.</P>
      <P>Policy suggestions from the conference will be referred to the
government before it holds a second national conference on economic
development that will seek ways to revive Taiwan's economy, Huang
added.</P>
      <P>The "active opening, effective management" China investment
policy implemented by President Chen Shui-bian over the past five
years following the first national economic development conference
has had a negative impact on Taiwan's economy, he said.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the policy has led to as much as US$250
billion in capital flight leaving Taiwan for China, and more than 70
percent of Taiwan's core industries have moved their manufacturing
overseas, driving up unemployment and widening the gap between rich
and poor at home.</P>
      <P>Facing a crisis of such an economic "hollowing out, " Taiwan
Advocates has proposed globalization as a way to reduce Taiwan's
reliance on the Chinese market, he said, adding that the government
needs to come up with better management techniques -- rather than
restrictions -- to guide Taiwan investors.</P>
      <P>Prior to the conference, Taiwan Advocates will also hold four
seminars in Taipei, Taichung, Yunlin and Kaohsiung areas.</P>

recently in Turin that he did not wish to see political issues affect
the organization of the games.</P>
      <P>On the controversial Olympics torch relay route, Tsai reiterated
Taiwan's stance, which is that after leaving China, the torch must be
rerouted through another Olympics member state before it can come
through Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking on Taiwan's failed bid in Turin to host the next Olympic
Congress, Tsai said Taipei proposed the most generous conditions
among all the hopefuls, but since the 2009 congress will also decide
the host country of the 2016 Summer Olympics, they were not enough to
secure success for diplomatically weak Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But Tsai said Taiwan will continue to bid for the right to host
the 2010 Olympic Congress.</P>
      <P>Copenhagen was chosen to stage the 13th Olympic Congress, beating

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT WANTS TO BE REMEMBERED: ACADEMICS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's recent proposal
to consider scrapping the National Unification Council (NUC) and the
National Unification Guidelines formulated by the former Kuomintang
administration is an attempt to leave his mark on history, the head
of a privately funded think tank said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-cheng, executive director of the Institute for National
Policy Research, made the remarks prior to a seminar sponsored by the
institute on the new Cabinet and the new political situation.
The institute is funded by local tycoon Chang Jung-fa for the purpose
of public policy research.</P>
      <P>According to Lo, there is a big possibility that Chen will
abolish the NUC and the guidelines during his term in order to leave
a legacy that will remain after he steps down in 2008.</P>
      <P>"While Chen might not be able to declare Taiwan independence
during his term, he may at least do away with the NUC and the
guidelines, which were set in 1990 with an aim of eventual
unification with China, to ensure that Taiwan people will have other
options than unification," Lo said.</P>
      <P>He also predicted that "cross-Taiwan Strait relations will not be
tranquil this year, " noting that 2006 marks the 10th anniversary of
the 1996 missile crisis, when China lobbed missiles into waters near
Taiwan prior to the first popular presidential election in Taiwan,
and the first anniversary of Beijing's enactment of its
anti-secession law.</P>
      <P>Also, in late March, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will conduct a general debate on cross-strait policy, Lo said.
In April, U.S. President George W. Bush and Chinese President Hu
Jintao will meet in the United States and this summer, the United
States will hold a series of major naval exercises in the Pacific,
he continued.</P>
      <P>Chao Chien-ming, a professor at National Chengchi University,
echoed Lo's forecast, adding that Chen wants to take back the
initiative on issues from the main opposition Kuomintang in the wake
of the DPP's defeat in the Dec. 3 local elections. Chen's NUC proposal
is for "domestic consumption," he claimed.</P>
      <P>However, Lo also agreed with the views of Joseph Wu, chairman of
the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, that the National
Unification Guidelines resembles China's anti-secession law and
needs to be reviewed.</P>
      <P>He said that both the guidelines and the anti-secession law are
based on the premise of eventual unification and could even be seen
as an obligation of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He also said that intensive communications between Taiwan and the
United States should help ease U.S. concern about Chen's proposal.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian lauded local
medical professionals Thursday for braving hardship and risk to offer
medical services in remote developing countries over the past several
decades.</P>
      <P>In an article carried in the latest edition of his weekly
Internet newsletter, Chen said Taiwan has a long history of sending
medical personnel on missions to Third World countries in need of
medical aid.</P>
      <P>Back in late 1962, when many African countries were plagued by
civil war, Chen recalled that Taiwan sent six military doctors to
Libya to help the North African country improve its medical services
and develop a military medical system.</P>
      <P>"The Libya mission kickstarted Taiwan medical services overseas,"
Chen wrote.</P>
      <P>In the ensuing years, Chen went on, Taiwan has posted medical
missions to many African nations, including the Central African
Republic, Guinea-Bissau, Sao Tome and Principe, Malawi, Burkina Faso
and Chad.</P>
      <P>"Our medical professionals have often braved the dangers of war
and the risk of contagious diseases to offer medical services and
health care for African people. Their professional expertise and
dedication have won friendship and respect from those countries and
worldwide recognition as well," Chen wrote.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, he continued, a group of local college
professors and students, with assistance from the Taiwan Presbyterian
Church, traveled to Sri Lanka, parts of which were devastated by the
tsunami of late 2004, to help with post-disaster rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>"Their two-week stint helped the residents of a coastal town in
southeastern Sri Lanka to get a taste of goodwill and concern from
Taiwan. To express their gratitude, the townsfolk have decided to
name a major highway in the town as 'Taiwan Road,'" Chen wrote.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
denied media reports Thursday that he told a news weekly in an
interview that Taiwan will not buy submarines from the United States.</P>
      <P>Clarifying his position through a written statement released by
his aides, Wang said the procurement of eight submarines depends on
whether the United States is willing to quote a new price and how the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) interacts with the
opposition parties.</P>
      <P>He said the priorities of Taiwan's military procurement plans
should be the purchase of P-3C anti-submarine aircraft and the
upgrading of Taiwan's existing Patriot PAC II anti-missile batteries.</P>
      <P>Wang denied saying Taiwan will not buy submarines from the United
States, although he acknowledged that he did point out during the
interview that the submarine deal was troubled by three problems --
the manufacturing country is unknown, the price quoted by the United
States is too high and the delivery period of 15 years is too long.</P>
      <P>In the past two years, the DPP government has tried to seek
legislative approval of a NT$480 billion (US$14.9 billion) special
budget to purchase eight diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PAC
III anti-missile batteries and 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft from
the United States, but has been consistently blocked by the

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A closed-door seminar on a long-stalled
arms procurement plan will be held at the military's tightly guarded
Joint Operations Training Center Friday, organizers said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The seminar is being jointly organized by two lawmakers familiar
with national defense issues -- Lee Wen-chung of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and Shuai Hua-ming of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Lee said the seminar is aimed at forging a cross-party consensus
on the arms procurement project based on "professional evaluation."</P>
      <P>According to Lee, Minister of National Defense Lee Jye will lead
a delegation of relevant military officials at the seminar. A score
of military experts and retired generals have also been invited to
present their opinions.</P>
      <P>Lee said the seminar will focus on Taiwan's defense needs and the
allocation of defense budget.</P>
      <P>The two legislators organized the seminar as the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan has blocked the budget bill
for the DPP administration's plan to purchase eight diesel-electric
submarines, six Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries and a squadron
of 12 P-3C submarine-hunting aircraft from the United States for
nearly two years.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tseng Yung-chuan, who is also the chief executive
officer of the KMT's policy coordination department, said earlier the
same day that the party's headquarters and legislative caucus will
flesh out the party's basic stance and principles on the procurement
project by the end of this month. "We'll consult with other
opposition parties in early March to seek common ground and a
consistent stance on the issue," Tseng said.</P>
      <P>However, Legislator Ting Shou-chung, a member of the KMT's arms
procurement research panel, said he is skeptical that the party will
be able to sort out a common stance on the controversial issue in the
near future.</P>
      <P>According to Ting, the KMT's arms procurement research panel has
not met in recent weeks and a national security panel under the
party's policy coordination department has taken over the task of
working out the party's stance on the issue.</P>
      <P>To the best of his understanding, Ting said, the party's security
panel has yet to address the most critical parts of the project.</P>
      <P>Ting said the Patriot anti-missile batteries purchase plan should
not be discussed before a three-year ban expires in 2007, since a
2004 referendum on the plan did not meet the validity threshold.
According to the Referendum Act, any plan vetoed in a referendum
cannot be put up for a referendum again for three years.</P>
      <P>As for the submarine purchase plan, Ting said the price demanded
by the United States is unreasonably high and that no American
company is even available to build the submarines.</P>
      <P>With regard to the P-3C submarine-hunting aircraft, Ting said the
type is obsolete. "We should not purchase such old aircraft that
won't last long even after refurbishment, " he claimed.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) will draft a

popular online transactions over the Internet, Minister of Justice
Shih Mao-lin said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"With the credit card use and online trading becoming ever more

      <P>The planned chapter on online transactions will also circumscribe
the role and responsibilities of online trading companies or
operators of online transaction platforms, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Internet transactions have often engendered disputes because
consumers can only see the images of the merchandise on the Internet

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan or Cabinet will formally
appoint the 12 legislature-approved members of the National
Communications Commission (NCC) Friday to facilitate the
establishment of the much-anticipated body, officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The NCC appointment is part of the Cabinet's efforts to promote
domestic political harmony as opposition parties which control the
Legislative Yuan have threatened to boycott Premier Su Tseng-chang's
administrative report on the legislative floor if he fails to appoint
the 12 NCC members before the new legislative session opens next
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Three of the legislature-approved NCC members have informed the
Cabinet of their reluctance to serve on the new organization. As the
NCC Organic Law does not explicitly define the Cabinet as the body to
accept the NCC members' resignation, the officials said the Cabinet
will not exclude them from the list to be appointed by Su. If the
trio insist on their decision, they can tender their resignation to
the NCC chief after the body's formal establishment, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh refused to appoint the 13 NCC
commissioners as soon as the legislature confirmed the list Jan. 12
in accordance with the NCC Organic Law that took effect Nov. 9 last
year.</P>
      <P>Hsieh's Cabinet asked the Council of Grand Justices (CGJ) Jan. 20
to interpret the constitutionality of the NCC Organic Law, claiming
that the law infringes upon the executive branch's constitutional
power and thus seriously damages the constitutional system. It also
requested the council to impose an injunction suspending the
establishment of the NCC pending a constitutionality ruling.</P>
      <P>On Feb. 10, the CGJ announced its acceptance of the Cabinet's
requests for a constitutionality ruling and an injunction of the law
pending its ruling.</P>
      <P>The CGJ has begun reviewing the case and is scheduled to hold a
hearing March 8 on the case. The Executive Yuan and other relevant
organizations, scholars and experts will be invited to present their
views and stances during the full-day hearing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. CONGRESSMAN PUSHES FOR SIGNING OF FTA WITH TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A pro-Taiwan member of the U.S. House
of Representatives has proposed a resolution urging President George
W. Bush to make the conclusion of a U.S.-Taiwan free trade agreement
(FTA) one of the top priorities of his administration.</P>
      <P>The proposed resolution, which was put forth by Robert E. Andrews
Wednesday, also calls for Bush to instruct the U.S. Trade
Representative to expedite negotiations on a FTA between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>The draft resolution says a U.S.-Taiwan FTA would provide
recognition of Taiwan's status as a free and democratic nation and
would further enhance Taiwan's democracy.</P>
      <P>The draft points out that the United States is Taiwan's largest
trading partner and is a net exporter of agricultural products to
Taiwan, with Taiwan being one of the top 10 largest markets for U.S.
agricultural products in 2005.</P>
      <P>It says that Taiwan functions as the gateway to Asia, has the
world's third-largest foreign exchange reserves, is the world's
third-largest exporter of information technology-related products,
and ranks fourth in global growth competitiveness among the countries
surveyed by the World Economic Forum in 2004.</P>
      <P>It also notes that Taiwan is the eight-largest trading partner of
the United States, which is a higher ranking than many countries with
which the United States has concluded FTAs, including Australia,
Jordan, Morocco, Panama, Singapore and several Central American
countries.</P>
      <P>Of the 13 criteria spelled out by former U.S. Trade
Representative Robert Zoellick in 2003 for selecting potential FTA
partners, Taiwan also meets the criteria better than these countries,
the draft says.</P>
      <P>It cites a report released by the International Trade Commission
in October 2002 as estimating that U.S. exports to Taiwan would
increase by 16 percent, or roughly US$3.4 billion annually, after the
signing of an FTA between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Another report released by the Institute for International
Economics in 2004 predicted that U.S. exports to Taiwan would see an
annual increase of US$6.6 billion, the draft says.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FAPA URGES U.S. GOV'T TO SIGN FTA WITH TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Gorge Liu and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Washington-headquartered Formosan
Association for Public Affairs (FAPA) on Thursday urged the U.S.
government to sign a free trade agreement (FTA) with Taiwan for the
two countries' mutual benefit.</P>
      <P>FAPA President C. T. Lee claimed that forging a U.S.-Taiwan FTA
will not only create increased trade opportunities and profits for
the U.S. business sector, it will also help consolidate Taiwan's
democratization, help Taiwan break out of its isolation in the
international community and reduce the chances of Beijing attacking
Taiwan militarily.</P>
      <P>Lee, on behalf of the world-wide, pro-Taiwan independence
organization FAPA, expressed his respect and appreciation Thursday to
Congressman Robert E. Andrews (D-N.J.), who on Wednesday initiated a
House resolution urging U.S. President George W. Bush to make the
conclusion of a U.S.-Taiwan FTA one of the top priorities of his
administration.</P>
      <P>Following in Andrews' footsteps, two other members of the U.S.
House of Representatives -- Jim Ramstad (R-Minn.) and William
Jefferson (D-La.) -- jointly put forth a resolution Thursday urging
Bush to instruct the U.S. Trade Representative to expedite
negotiations on a FTA between the United States and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the United States has recently begun bilateral FTA
talks with Malaysia and South Korea. Taiwan, which was officially
admitted into the World Trade Organization in January 2002, ranks as
the eighth largest trading partner with the United States, which is
higher than many countries with which the United States has concluded
FTAs, he quoted Andrews' proposed resolution as indicating.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, President Bush openly lauded Taiwan's
freedom and democracy in a speech delivered in Kyoto, Japan last
November during which he stated that Taiwan should serve as a model
for China as well as East Asia.</P>
      <P>These were only some of the factors prompting more U.S.
congressmen to throw their support behind the signing of a FTA with
Taiwan in light of the fact that on Aug. 6, 2002, President Bush
signed into law the Trade Act of 2002, which provides for an
expedited procedure for congressional consideration of international
trade agreements, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he added, the latest U.S. trade figures have shown that
the United States' trade deficit with China has hit a new high,
already exceeding US$200 billion. It is the "right direction" for the
current U.S. administration to revise its foreign trade policy toward
Asia and facilitate the signing of a U.S.-Taiwan FTA to help turn
this situation around, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BUSINESS OWNERS UNDER THE MOST STRESS: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London, Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By J.J. Hwang and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>For the second consecutive year, the stress
levels endured by business owners in Taiwan were the highest in 2005
among business owners worldwide, according to the results of a survey
released by Grant Thornton, a leading financial and business adviser
to mid-corporate businesses.</P>
      <P>The 2006 International Business Owners Survey was carried out on
more than 7,000 owners of medium-sized businesses from 30 countries
in the fall of 2005.</P>
      <P>The survey shows that 57 percent of business owners around the
world said they were more stressed than one year ago, compared with
just 39 percent who said so in a similar survey conducted the
previous year.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, 90 percent of the respondents said their stress had
increased over the past year, up from the 69 percent registered in
the previous survey.</P>
      <P>Others at the top of the stress list include China, the
Philippines, Botswana, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Africa, in that
order.</P>
      <P>Of all the business owners surveyed worldwide, only 6 percent
said their stress had decreased over the past year.</P>
      <P>It was found that the stress levels were the lowest among
business owners in Sweden, followed by Italy, Spain and France.</P>
      <P>The report says that the stress levels of business owners are
related to the number of holidays that they enjoy, noting that most
business owners in Asia saw their stress levels increase last year
mainly because they seldom took any days off or went on vacation.</P>
      <P>For example, it says, business owners in Taiwan only took eight
days off on average last year, while those in Thailand took four days
and those in Malaysia had 10 days. This compares with business owners
in European countries who had 22 days off last year on average.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. TRIES TO GIVE TAIWAN SPACE IN INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY: RICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Though the United States has insisted
on its "one China" policy, it has also tried to give Taiwan space
within the international community, U.S. Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Rice made the remarks while attending a hearing of the House
International Relations Committee on the fiscal year 2007
international affairs budget request.</P>
      <P>Rep. Steve Chabot (R-Ohio) , co-chairman of the Congressional
Taiwan Caucus, a pro-Taiwan group in the House, asked Rice during the
hearing about cross-Taiwan Strait relations and the
U.S. role in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chabot admitted that he is "not a big fan" of the so-called
one China policy, saying he believes that its "wrongheaded" and
"dangerous."</P>
      <P>He also said that the main threat to the status quo in the Taiwan
Strait is China's ever-growing military buildup. China, with 784
missiles directed at Taiwan and its recent enactment of an
anti-secession law, is a threat to the status quo, he continued.</P>
      <P>In response, Rice said that the U.S. has pursued "a policy that
does recognize that there is one China, " but it has tried also to
make space for Taiwan in international organizations and
international groupings.</P>
      <P>For instance, she said the U.S. advocates having Taiwan in the
World Health Organization, insists that Taiwan continue to be
involved in the economic part of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum.</P>
      <P>"I think we have tried to give Taiwan space to be active in
international politics," Rice noted.</P>
      <P>Rice said that she understands Chabot has differences of opinion
regarding the policy, but the U.S. has "carried out the policy in a
way consistent with its interests" and "consistent with our values in
trying to support Taiwan's democracy to give it room and space within
the international community, to give it a way to engage the
international community, and to do that within the context of this
policy."</P>
      <P>On cross-strait relations, she said that "the best course is to
have a situation in which neither side tries to change the status quo
unilaterally. "We also believe that the Chinese should not provoke
Taiwan, and we've been very clear to them on the same count."</P>
      <P>The U.S. has also been clear that it has obligations under the
Taiwan Relations Act to help Taiwan defend itself, she added.</P>
      <P>The U.S. has "proposed that there are things that could be done
for the modernization of Taiwanese forces with the help of the United
States," Rice said.</P>
      <P>However, the U.S. hasn't always received "a particularly
satisfactory response on the Taiwanese side to issues about defense
modernization, but we have been prepared to discharge our duties in
that regard," she said.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian sent his
congratulations Friday morning to Haitian President-elect Rene Preval
who was declared the winner of the latest presidential election in
the Caribbean country several hours earlier.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Republic of China government and people,
President Chen offered congratulations to Preval, expressing the hope
that Haiti will begin a brand new era of democracy under Preval's
leadership, according to Michel Lu, spokesman for the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>In the congratulatory message, Lu said, President Chen expressed
his expectation that under Preval's leadership, Taiwan-Haiti
bilateral cooperation in various sectors will continue to flourish
based on the existing cordial friendship between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Preval immediately expressed his appreciation to Chen in his
return message, saying that he will boost Haiti's bilateral exchanges
with Taiwan after assuming office and will visit Taiwan and meet with
President Chen soon.</P>
      <P>Preval said that during his stint as the Haitian president
between 1996 and 2001, he was instrumental in facilitating various
cooperative projects between Haiti and Taiwan, including hot food for
school children, nation-wide road development, infrastructure
development and Taiwan's agro-technological aid to Haiti.</P>
      <P>"These efforts have proved that Taiwan is a true friend of Haiti

63, has visited Taiwan twice, with his most recent visit being in

    <HEADLINE>KMT DEMANDS PREMIER APPOINT NCC MEMBERS IMMEDIATELY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  17 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers
threatened Friday to boycott Premier Su Tseng-chang's Feb. 21
administrative report in the legislature unless Su appoints the 12
Legislative Yuan-approved members of the National Communications
Commission (NCC) immediately. </P>
      <P>Pan Wei-kang, a whip of the KMT legislative caucus, made the
remarks along with her colleagues Tsai Chin-lung and Huang Teh-fu at
the Legislative Yuan. She claimed the Executive Yuan wants to cripple
the NCC after failing to control it.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the NCC has had a rough ride since the bill
concerning its organic law was delivered to the Legislative Yuan for
ratification last year. Even after the law came into effect Nov. 9
and its 13 members were approved by the legislature in accordance
with the law Jan. 12, the NCC was still not able to begin
functioning. </P>
      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh refused to appoint the NCC
commissioners as soon as the legislature confirmed the list and
furthermore, his Cabinet asked the Council of Grand Justices Jan. 20
to interpret the constitutionality of the NCC Organic Law, claiming
that it infringes upon the executive branch's constitutional power
and thus seriously damages the constitutional system. It also
requested that the council impose an injunction suspending the
commission's establishment pending a constitutional ruling.</P>
      <P>Pan accused the Executive Yuan of attempting to paralyze the NCC
and smear the NCC members' reputations after discovering that it
cannot control the new organization. </P>
      <P>The NCC Organic Law stipulates that the premier is required to
name the NCC members based on the recommendations of a "nomination
and review committee" formed according to a political party
representation formula based on the proportional representation
system.</P>
      <P>Since the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the
People First Party (PFP) have a slim majority in the legislature, the
NCC members recommended by the alliance outnumber those recommended
by the "pan-green camp" headed by the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party.</P>
      <P>Pan said that if Su does not appoint the NCC members with

    <HEADLINE>U.S. WILL LOSE INTEREST IN TAIWAN IF ARMS PURCHASE FAILS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
speculated Friday that if a long-stalled plan to purchase arms from
the United States fails to clear the next legislative session,
Washington will "lose interest in Taiwan affairs."</P>
      <P>Wang's remarks came after nearly two years of stalling by the
opposition-controlled legislature on the arms procurement package of
eight diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PAC III anti-missile
batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C submarine-hunting aircraft.
</P>
      <P>However, he also said this does not mean the U.S. will not supply
Taiwan with defensive weapons.</P>
      <P>Whether President Chen Shui-bian likes it or not, he will be
obliged to accept the dropping of the purchase of the missile
batteries from the arms procurement package until a three-year ban on
a referendum on the issue expires in 2007, Wang said. </P>
      <P>He noted that in a 2004 referendum, one of the two questions
asked was: "Should China refuse to withdraw the missiles it has
targeted at Taiwan and to openly renounce the use of force against
us, would you agree that the government should acquire more advanced
anti-missile weapons to strengthen Taiwan's self-defense
capabilities?"</P>
      <P>The referendum was considered invalid because less than 50
percent of eligible voters cast their ballots. The same issue cannot
be put to referendum again within a three-year period, Wang said.</P>
      <P>He also said that the opposition has made clear its
stance on the arms procurement package.</P>
      <P>Wang said this is why he suggested to Chen during recent meetings
to "deal with items that can be dealt with now, " otherwise the
problem will become even worse.</P>
      <P>Although the referendum prevents the purchase of the Patriot
PAC-III batteries, Wang suggested that the Patriot PAC-II batteries
presently deployed in Taiwan be upgraded, pointing out that the
upgrading of the existing batteries would be unrelated to the result
of the referendum.</P>
      <P>"If the legislators across the party spectrum all agree on this
point, this should be dealt with first," he continued.</P>
      <P>He denied saying during his recent visit that Taiwan should not
"buy the diesel-electric submarines," but said he did suggest that
Washington should adjust lower the price tag.</P>
      <P>The opposition will not discuss the budget for the submarines
at present because the price seems "unreasonably high," Wang said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Epoch Times, which describes itself as
an organization committed to upholding justice and human rights, has
lunched a global hunger strike campaign aimed at protesting Beijing's
suppression of Chinese dissidents and its infringements upon human
rights.</P>
      <P>An Epoch Times spokesman said Friday that the global hunger
strikes will last for one month to allow the entire world to "know
the truth" about the Chinese authorities' persistent suppression of
human rights.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that the hunger strike was launched after two
socially active dissidents, including well-known Chinese lawyer Gao
Zhicheng, were attacked. Gao launched a hunger strike at his Beijing
home recently after he was spied on and narrowly escaped death in an
"apparently planned" car accident after he wrote open letters to
Chinese President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao criticizing
suppression by the Chinese authorities of Chinese social activists
and Falun Gong followers.</P>
      <P>In early February, Li Yuan, the Epoch Times' technical supervisor
in the United States, was attacked and severely injured in his home
in Atlanta, Georgia by several Chinese people.</P>
      <P>To protest these attacks on Gao and Li, the Epoch Times, which
maintains an influential opinion Web site, launched the hunger strike
in the United States and soon saw emulations by supporters in Canada,
Germany, Switzerland, France, Japan, Malaysia and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, supporters have been taking part in the hunger strikes
in Taipei, Taoyuan, Yunlin, Tainan, Kaohsiung and Pingtung.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCRAPPING OF NUC TO RAISE INTER-PARTY TENSION: LEGISLATIVE HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Friday that if the National Unification Council (NUC) and the
National Unification Guidelines are scrapped, "it will inevitably
increase tension between the ruling and the opposition parties."</P>
      <P>Wang was responding to media reports that President Chen
Shui-bian intends to scrap the NUC, a 15-year-old relic of the former
Kuomintang (KMT) administration, by the end of this month. The
president also asked the Cabinet to repeal the National Unification
Guidelines, which set a three-stage process leading to eventual
unification with China, media reports also said.</P>
      <P>Wang said that he was not aware of the reports and that the
"president will decide on the matter."</P>
      <P>He said the stance of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) is clearly that the quicker the NUC and the guidelines are
scrapped the better, while the opposition KMT and its ally the People
First Party are vehemently opposed to the proposal.</P>
      <P>Asked about the DPP's hopes for constitutional re-engineering and
dealing with sensitive issues as national territory, name and flag,
Wang said only "it will be a big question if issues such as national
territory and the country's name are put forward for discussion."</P>
      <P>The United States expressed concern after Chen's Jan. 29 proposal
to seriously consider scrapping the NUC. Chen also said earlier this
week that he faces no less pressure from the U.S. than he did in
2004, when he insisted on holding the first national referendum.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI COUNTY GOVERNMENT TO DEMOLISH JAPANESE WAR MEMORIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  17 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei county government officials said
Friday that they will order the demolition of a controversial war
memorial in the county that critics say eulogizes Japanese
militarism.</P>
      <P>Taipei County Deputy Magistrate Lee Hung-yuan admitted that it is
inappropriate that the monument has been allowed to be set up on
county land and he apologized to the public.</P>
      <P>At issue is a memorial at the Wulai Waterfall Park in Wulai
township that was set up recently by a Japanese civic group on land
rented from the county in commemoration of a team of Taiwan
aboriginal soldiers that fought for the Japanese Imperial Army during
World War II.</P>
      <P>The structure comprises a series of stone tablets with
inscriptions in Japanese that mourn the deceased soldiers, commend
their bravery and sacrifice for Japan, narrate the history of the
establishment of the team and express loyalty to the emperor of
Japan.</P>
      <P>According to a local media report, many recent visitors to the
park were confused by the sight of a large number of Japanese flags
flying in the park and expressed their displeasure at the
establishment of the monument.</P>
      <P>The monument has also raised serious concern from aboriginal
Legislator Kao Chin Su-mei, who visited the county government Friday
to demand that the monument be removed.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin emphasized that the aborigines in Taiwan have the right
to interpret their history, including that of their ancestors who
were forced to fight for their Japanese colonial rulers, and that
they cannot accept the imperialistic and militaristic concepts that
the monument demonstrates.</P>
      <P>She claimed the inscriptions on the monument are a distortion of
history that she said has caused aversion among people in Taiwan and
has hurt the aboriginal population.</P>
      <P>The legislator said she will meet with aboriginal representatives
to discuss the possibility of setting up their own monument to
remember their ancestors.</P>
      <P>Last year, Kao Chin visited Japan to demand the removal of
tablets for the Taiwan aboriginal soldiers from the controversial
Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo. She also demanded that the Japanese
government apologize and pay compensation for the persecution of
indigenous residents during its colonial rule in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>A Department of Health (DOH) official said
Friday that Taiwan-produced mushrooms of Brazilian origin are safe to
eat.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Tung-ming, acting director of the DOH Bureau of Food
Sanitation, made the remarks after the Japanese government issued a

mushrooms processed by Kirin Well-Foods of Japan are likely to
promote cancer. The Japanese government has ordered the company to
stop selling and to recall the product.</P>
      <P>Noting that neither Taiwan Kirin nor any other Taiwanese
companies have imported the mushrooms, Hsiao pointed out that the
public can obtain them online or buy them during visits to Japan and
he urged people not to eat them until they are proved safe.</P>
      <P>Hwang Yih-jiau, legislative caucus leader of the opposition
People First Party, also held a press conference that day, urging the
related government agencies to crack down on the illegal online sale
of the Japanese products.</P>
      <P>The mushrooms are quite popular and are considered a health food
in Taiwan, as many people believe they fight cancer and increase
immunity.</P>
      <P>Hsiao claimed that the same mushrooms grown locally have been

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Friday that he would be pleased to visit China to meet Beijing
authorities for talks on problems faced by most China-based Taiwan
investors and the rights and interests of Taiwan businessmen
operating in China.</P>
      <P>Wang said he will seriously consider making a trip to China when
both the government and people of Taiwan agree on his visit, the
legislature is resolved on the issue and the Chinese government is
willing to solve the problems concerning the rights and interests of
Taiwan businessmen operating in China -- known locally as "Taishang"
-- based on the principles of equality and dignity.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while presiding over the opening of a
workshop organized by the Chinese Cross-Strait Cultural and Economic
Association on cross-Taiwan Strait issues and ways to protect the
rights and interests of Taishang.</P>
      <P>Workshop sponsor Liao Wan-lung, owner of the Xiamen-based CB
Carbide Co., said that Taishang have created fortunes and job
opportunities in China by the sweat of their brows but have been
treated coldly by the government in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liao said many Taishang hope that some important Taiwan figure
will represent them in talks with the Chinese authorities to help
tackle their problems. He suggested that Wang take the initiative in
traveling to China for such talks.</P>
      <P>Wang, a stalwart of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), added that
KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan paid a "historic visit" to China in
his capacity as KMT chairman last year and reached a number of
agreements with the Chinese authorities on benefits for Taishang.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Wang went on, none of the agreements have been put
into force because of a lack of consensus of the Democratic
Progressive Party government.</P>
      <P>If given the opportunity, Wang said, he would also be willing to
negotiate with the Chinese authorities on other major cross-strait
affairs, including the signing of a cross-strait peace accord.</P>

      <P>Taiwan Sugar Corp. (Taisugar) is
considering whether to restart prospecting at the Jinguashi mine in
Taipei County that has not been worked for nearly 20 years, Taisugar
officials said Friday at a meeting with mine operators.</P>
      <P>Taisugar, which sponsored the meeting with mine operators to
exchange views with them on the prospects for the mine, said the
company expects to finish all the necessary paperwork by the end of
May and will then begin to invite bids for prospecting.</P>
      <P>Taisugar officials said that the mineral reserves in the mine
include gold, copper and silver, with gold accounting for the
majority.</P>
      <P>With the soaring price of gold recently on the world market, they

      <P>Prospecting at the Jinguashi workings started when Taiwan was
still under the colonial rule of Japan (1895-1945). The Ministry of

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party

provoking a nationwide debate on the issue of Taiwan independence
versus unification with China, an opposition lawmaker claimed Friday.</P>
      <P>Daniel Hwang, convener of the legislative caucus of the People

    <HEADLINE>NATIONAL UNIFICATION COUNCIL MEANINGLESS: DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 17 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The existence of the National Unification
Council (NUC) is meaningless and the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) supports President Chen Shui-bian's idea of scrapping the
NUC and its guidelines, DPP legislative caucus whip Chen Chin-jun
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at a news conference he called at the
Legislative Yuan in the midst of controversy whipped up by the issue
at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the NUC is a body "illegally" set up by the
previous Kuomintang (KMT) administration to push for Taiwan's
unification with China, Chen said that it is pointless for the NUC to
remain in existence any longer because China has failed to match the
conditions drawn up in the National Unification Guidelines to pave
way for Taiwan's eventual unification with China.</P>
      <P>According to the objectives envisioned in the guidelines for
different phrases prior to eventual unification, China should reform
its economy and gradually allow greater freedom of speech and
implement rule of law in the short term, while helping Taiwan enter
international organizations and set up direct trade, transport and
postal links with Taiwan in the mid-term, Chen said.</P>
      <P>But China has no intention of meeting these aims, as seen in the
fact that Beijing has stepped up its suppression of Taiwan in the
international community, increased the number of missiles aimed at
Taiwan and last year implemented its anti-secession law aimed at
further suppressing Taiwan, Chen said.</P>
      <P>It is meaningless to keep the guidelines, as the KMT has also
violated them by seeking to open direct transport links with China,
even though China still falls short of meeting the near-term
conditions, Chen said. Direct links are a mid-term goal set fourth in
the guidelines.</P>
      <P>He acknowledged that there is pressure from China and the United
States on the president's plan to scrap the guidelines, but said that
Taiwan, as an independent sovereignty, must brave the stress and
speak out to the international community, which he said is the
long-term goal and the utmost value pursued by the DPP.</P>
      <P>He also said that constitutional amendment proposals related to
the nation's official title, national flag and territorial boundaries
should be discussed out of respect for Taiwan's pluralistic society.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP spokesman Tsai Huang-liang also called a news
conference at the party headquarters to endorse the president's idea
of dissolving the NUC, saying that it should be done "as soon as
possible."</P>
      <P>Now that the KMT has also listed independence as one possible
option for the Taiwan people regarding the country's future, hurdles,
such as the Republic of China Constitution and the NUC setting the
stage for "one China," should be cleared, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>According to local media reports, President Chen has said that
the NUC might be abolished within this month.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a new constitution that the DPP hopes to put
forward, Tsai said that the DPP will carry out the task through a
democratic process and without any preset positions, to allow for
broad discussions with the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The DPP will remain open toward the issue and will accept any
conclusions made by a majority of the Taiwan people in the hope of
creating a tailor-made constitution for Taiwan, he added.</P>
      <P>The DPP plans to put forward its draft version of a new
constitution in June, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, opposition lawmakers from the KMT and the People First
Party (PFP) demanded that the president and the ruling DPP provide a
clear explanation on all these matters "once and for all."</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus whip Pan Wei-kang asked the president to
make clear if he really wants to scrap the NUC, while her PFP
counterpart, Daniel Y. J. Hwang, accused him of trying to shift the
focus away from public discontent with the government arising from
several high-profile corruption scandals involving ranking government
officials.</P>

    <DATELINE>Brussels, Feb. 17 (CNA)
(By Huang Tzu-chiang and Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will
issue the party's policy statement on Taiwan's military procurement
by the end of this month or in early March, KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
said in the capital of Belgium Friday.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is leading a business promotion group from Taiwan on a
five-nation European tour in his capacity as Taipei mayor, told
reporters that before the policy statement is issued, the KMT will
ask its legislative caucus to consult the Ministry of National
Defense.</P>
      <P>Ma said the KMT will not discuss any plans for buying Patriot III
missile batteries from the United States because the 2004 referendum
had already vetoed the purchase.</P>
      <P>He stressed this is purely a matter of abiding by the law and has
nothing to do with the KMT's position.</P>
      <P>As for other items on the procurement list, the KMT will make a
clear explanation of its positions in the policy statement, Ma added.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the KMT is likely to make concessions and allow
arms-related budget plans to pass through the legislature, Ma
declined to give any hint.</P>
      <P>He also said he has not asked Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng to communicate with or relay any message to President Chen
Shui-bian about the KMT's policy on military procurement.</P>
      <P>Ma arrived in Belgium Thursday on the last leg of his European

    <HEADLINE>COA TO DECIDE BY APRIL 3 WHETHER TO ACCEPT CHINA'S PANDAS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) will
decide by April 3 whether to accept two giant pandas China wants to
send to Taiwan as gifts, a senior official said Friday. </P>
      <P>Lee Tao-sheng, deputy director of the COA's Forestry Bureau, made
the remarks after presiding over a hearing on China's panda offer to
solicit opinions from environmentalists, wildlife conservationists
and representatives of colleges and universities that have a zoology
department.</P>
      <P>China has offered to present Taiwan with a pair of giant pandas
and two local institutions -- the government-owned Taipei City Zoo
and the privately run Leofoo Village safari park in Hsinchu -- have
applied to host the pandas.</P>
      <P>A COA-led special task force already held several rounds of
consultative meetings last November and December to ponder whether to
open the door to the pandas or "cat-bears" as they are called in
Chinese.</P>
      <P>Lee said the panel will continue to study the issue after
Friday's hearing.</P>
      <P>The COA was originally scheduled to decide by March 23 whether to
approve the panda import applications. But Lee said the schedule will
be postponed to April 3 because Leofoo safari park has to produce
some additional documents.</P>
      <P>At Friday's hearing, all environmental and conservation advocacy
groups voiced strong opposition to panda imports.</P>
      <P>China has chosen a pair of giant pandas to be sent to Taiwan as
"goodwill presents" to the people of Taiwan, but COA officials
insisted that China cannot send its pandas to the island without the
Taiwan government's consent.</P>
      <P>"Key points being weighed by the task force include whether the
import procedures comply with international wildlife conservation
regulations, whether the would-be host zoo has adequate manpower
resources and facilities, and whether local vets can cope with any
relevant emergencies," Lee said.</P>
      <P>China made the panda offer to Lien Chan while he was on a visit
to China last May in his capacity of chairman of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT). Lien has since retired from the post, but retains a
titular title of honorary chairman.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations of the multilateral Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora,
pandas can only be on loan from China to other countries and all the
financial benefits from the exhibition of giant pandas, after
deducting the costs incurred, should be used for the conservation of
the species in China. The conservation fee every country has to pay
China is up to US$1 million a year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan authorities have reiterated that the transfer of pandas,
if approved, should be seen as an international loan, not a domestic
transfer as China claims.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  17 (CNA)
(By Debby Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang vowed Friday to
improve Taiwan's economy and to work on making the country's
investment climate attractive to foreign investors.</P>
      <P>"We will work harder on economic development. We will do
everything we can to improve Taiwan's investment climate and to
welcome foreign investors," Su said.</P>
      <P>Su made the statement while attending a Chinese New Year party
for foreign diplomats and representatives based in Taiwan held by the
Chinese International Economic Cooperation Association (CIECA).</P>
      <P>Over 150 officials and business representatives from more than 50
countries attended the event, including Burkina Faso's Ambassador to
Taiwan, Jacques Y. Sawadogo, who concurrently serves as head of the
diplomatic corps in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Su also urged the international community to further collaborate
with Taiwan and to support its quest for full participation in the
international community.</P>
      <P>"Faced by the tide of globalization and intensifying
international cooperation, it is hard for countries to meet the
challenges of the market by going it alone. The key to securing
competitive advantage is collaboration," Su said.</P>
      <P>"We can maximize our chances of success by dividing our labor and
complementing each other's strength in the industrial supply chain,
and by strengthening cooperative links with our trading partners," he
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Sawadogo praised Taiwan's economic achievements at the
event.</P>
      <P>"In spite of a more and more rough and merciless international
competition, and a difficult and unfavorable world situation, the
Taiwanese economy has found the ways and means to remain competitive
and dynamic. It has even acquired -- in many high technology sectors
-- a strong position in the world,"Sawadogo said.</P>
      <P>"Your beautiful country occupies a very important position in the
world economy today and plays a big role in international trade, " he
said.</P>
      <P>CIECA, headed by Jeffery L.S. Koo, is a non-profit, private
organization promoting Taiwan's bilateral economic ties with other
countries. The association has helped Taiwan sign bilateral trade
agreements with 61 countries. The association has been hosting an

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER APPOINTS 12 NCC MEMBERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang formally appointed
the 12 legislature-approved members of the National Communications
Commission (NCC) Friday to facilitate the establishment of the
much-anticipated body.</P>
      <P>Cabinet spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang, who concurrently serves as
Government Information Office (GIO), said Premier Su approved the NCC
roster out of respect for the Council of Grand Justices (CGJ) and the
Legislative Yuan and in consideration of policy continuity.</P>
      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh refused to appoint the 12 NCC members
as soon as the legislature confirmed the list Jan. 12 in accordance
with the NCC Organic Law that took effect Nov. 9 last year.</P>
      <P>Hsieh's Cabinet asked the CGJ Jan. 20 to interpret the
constitutionality of the NCC Organic Law, claiming that the law
infringes upon the executive branch's constitutional power and thus
seriously damages the constitutional system. It also requested the
council to impose an injunction suspending the establishment of the
NCC pending a constitutionality ruling.</P>
      <P>According to Minister-without-Portfolio Hsu Chih-hsiung, only
eight grand justices voted for imposing an injunction on the NCC law
during a meeting two days ago, one vote short of the two-thirds of
the vote needed for approval of the Cabinet's request for injunction.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Cheng said, the premier decided to endorse
the legislature-approved NCC roster Friday so that the NCC can be
formally established before the opposition-controlled legislature
opens its new session next Tuesday.</P>
      <P>If all goes smoothly, Cheng said, the NCC can be inaugurated next
Monday at the earliest.</P>
      <P>Opposition parties have threatened to boycott Premier Su's
administrative report on the legislative floor if he fails to appoint
the 12 NCC members before the new legislative session opens Feb. 21.</P>
      <P>Once the controversial NCC becomes operational, Cheng said the
GIO will no longer handle any NCC-related affairs. The GIO has
finalized all the preparations for transferring personnel, budget and
archives to the NCC.</P>
      <P>Three of the legislature-approved NCC members have informed the
Cabinet of their reluctance to serve on the new organization. As the
NCC Organic Law does not explicitly define the Cabinet as the body to
accept the NCC members' resignation, Cheng said, Premier Su has not
excluded them from the roster.</P>
      <P>If the trio insist on their decision, Cheng said, they can tender
their resignation to the NCC chief after the body's formal
establishment.</P>
      <P>The 13-member CGJ has begun reviewing the case and is scheduled
to hold a hearing March 8 on the case. The Executive Yuan and other
relevant organizations, scholars and experts will be invited to
present their views and stances during the full-day hearing. After
the hearing, it may still take some time before the CGJ metes out its
ruling on whether the NCC is unconstitutional.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAW AMENDMENT PROPOSALS 'UNREALISTIC': MAC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  17  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice
Chairman Johnnason Liu called Friday for further deliberation on a
dozen proposals recommended by a group of China-based Taiwanese
business representatives with the aim of bettering cross-Taiwan
Strait trade, saying the set of demands were "sort of far-fetched"
and that they did not reflect the cross-strait political reality.</P>
      <P>Liu made the comments at a regular news briefing after a group of
China-based Taiwanese business professionals attended a seminar
earlier the same day at the Legislative Yuan to ask the government to
protect their interests by amending the law governing exchanges
between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Despite the group's keen expectations, Liu said that several
points they put forward were "unrealistic" due to Beijing's attitude.</P>
      <P>"It is Beijing that refuses to negotiate with Taiwan's government
authorities, and one-sided wishful thinking on Taiwan's side will go
nowhere and only undermine the country's overall interest," he said.</P>
      <P>He said all parties concerned were welcome to delve into the law
amendment proposals at the Legislative Yuan after matters that
involved the Civil Code and international law have been studied and
modified by the Judicial Yuan and the MAC.</P>
      <P>Business operators attending the seminar, which was co-chaired by
Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng and Chunghwa Cross-Strait
Cultural and Economic Association Chairman Liao Wan-lung, demanded
that the government revise the Statute Governing the Relations
Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, and
focus on setting up direct links with China on a variety of issues
ranging from tourism to fruit exports and air links.</P>
      <P>Tsai Wu-chang, a businessman from Putai, Chiayi county in
southern Taiwan, urged the government to set up direct shipping
services between Putai and Xiamen in China's Fujian province, saying
the measure would save local fruit exporters and religious pilgrims
time and money.</P>
      <P>Tu Heng-chang, a Taiwanese businessman from Guilin, Guangxi
province, proposed that Taiwan's government include Guilin in the
first phase of opening the country to Chinese tourism, and promote
direct charter flights between Taipei and Guilin.</P>
      <P>The number of Taiwanese tourists visiting Guilin annually rose
to over 4O0,O00 in 2005 from 250,000 in 2002, Tu said, adding that
direct charter flights would also be attractive to about
200 Taiwanese businesses operating in Guilin.</P>
      <P>Others said they hoped the government would do something concrete
in the accreditation of academic diplomas issued by Chinese
institutions of higher learning, and to help boost the number of
youth exchanges between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>The association submitted an endorsement signed by more than 200
Taiwan businesspeople calling for more extensive and free interaction
across the Strait.</P>

      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang is scheduled to deliver his administrative

report to the legislature after assuming his post Jan. 25.</P>
      <P>According to the written administrative report, the Democratic
Progressive Party-led government will invite all people of Taiwan
to join the government's efforts to expand Taiwan's diplomatic
ties and safeguard Taiwan's peace and security.</P>
      <P>The government also plans to strengthen the nation's research and

    <HEADLINE>CARRIERS PROPOSE CROSS-STRAIT WEEKEND FLIGHTS FOR 'TAISHANG'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 17 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Local carriers proposed a format Friday for
direct charter flight services across the Taiwan Strait on weekends
to benefit Taiwan business people operating in China, known locally
as "taishang."</P>
      <P>Speaking with a group of reporters, EVA Airways Corp. Chairman
Lin Pao-shuei said that before full-fledged direct cross-strait
passenger flights become a reality, the two sides can consider a
72-hour weekend charter flight formula for the convenience of
"taishang."</P>
      <P>According to Lin's proposal, direct cross-strait charter flights
can be offered during a 72-hour time span from Friday afternoon to
Monday morning to cater to the needs of Taiwanese business travelers.</P>
      <P>With more and more Taiwan businessmen investing in China, Lin
said, the demand for direct cross-strait flights would inevitably
increase.</P>
      <P>"It has been a dream to fly to China, work during the day and
return to Taiwan the same evening -- and direct flights would help
realize this dream, " Lin said, adding he is hopeful that the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait can sit down to talk and work out terms
for the proposed weekend direct charter flight services as early as
possible.</P>
      <P>China Airlines (CAL), Taiwan's largest carrier, supported Lin's
proposal, saying that there is an urgent need to promote charter
flights on weekends and holidays before full-fledged regular non-stop
flights become possible.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Lin-proposed 72-hour format, CAL executives
said many other formula can be worked out to meet practical market
demand.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, top executives from all six Taiwanese carriers
formerly operating direct cross-strait charter flights during the
Chinese New Year holiday will be attending a party in Beijing
Saturday to be hosted by the Civil Aviation Administration of China,
aviation sources said.</P>
      <P>In addition to Taiwanese entrepreneurs, representatives of
carriers from Hong Kong, Macao and China have also been invited to
take part in the event to celebrate the completion of provisional
direct charter flights between Taiwan and China during the Spring
Festival.</P>
      <P>Six carriers from each side of the Strait were allowed to operate
a total of 72 charter flights from Jan. 20 and Feb. 13 to fly
Taiwanese passport holders home for Chinese New Year.</P>
      <P>CAL, EVA Airways, Mandarin Airlines, TransAsia Airways, Far East
Air Transport Corp. and UNI Airways were the six Taiwanese carriers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. CONGRESSMEN DEFEND PRESIDENT CHEN'S REMARKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb. 17 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two U.S. congressmen jointly published
an article Friday, defending Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian's Chinese New Year's Day remarks that it's proper time now
to consider the abolition of the National Unification Council and the
National Unification Guidelines.</P>
      <P>The article, carried in the Washington Times, was jointly written
by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) and Rep. Steve Chabot (R.-Ohio) ,
both of them co-chairmen of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus, a
pro-Taiwan group in the U.S. Congress. </P>
      <P>While President Chen's political opponents and their allies in
China "seized the opportunity" to suggest that Chen's proposal was
adangerous move that would undermining the status quo across the
Taiwan Strait, the two congressmen dismissed their claim as "making a
mountain out of a molehill."</P>
      <P>They wrote that Chen's statement was not as dangerous as it was
irrelevant. "It was a thought, not a plan."</P>
      <P>"Having observed Taiwan and its leaders over many years, we find
it ironic that Mr. Chen's comments have received such attention. We
say this because despite the labels that opponents have tried to
attach to him, Mr. Chen has been perhaps the most responsible
adherent to the "status quo" during his six years in office, " they
wrote.</P>
      <P>"And he has been the only one to recognize its inviolability in
such a formal manner -- through a well-received formulation (known as
the 'four no's plus one! ') both at the beginning of his tenure and
after his second inaugural address," the article said.</P>
      <P>"Unfortunately, other parties to this longstanding diplomatic
conundrum have not felt bound recently by the same sense of
responsibility. For the parties to the Taiwan Strait issue, the
'status quo' has not always meant the same thing. In some ways, this
has helped prevent conflict for half a century, a period in which
Taiwan has seen growing economic prosperity and democratic freedom.
But of late, certain actions have been taken that defy anyone's
definition of the status quo -- and which go far beyond the words Mr.
Chen has used in recent weeks," the authors wrote.</P>
      <P>"Take for example the PRC's decision to adopt a so-called
'Anti-Secession Law' in March of last year, " the article continued,
"a measure that in effect provides legal authority for China's
leaders to invade Taiwan. Or China's offer -- and the acceptance --
of invitations for Taiwan's opposition leaders to visit Beijing and
discuss cross-Strait matters last summer. In both instances the
United States stood by Mr. Chen, calling on Beijing to engage in
dialogue with Taiwan's elected leader rather than continue its
diplomatic grandstanding -- not to mention its overt interference in
Taiwan's domestic politics," the article said.</P>
      <P>"In a unique instance of zoological diplomacy, " the article
continued, "Mr. Chen's opponents now want him to accept China's
proposed 'gift' of two giant pandas, despite the fact that accepting
them on the PRC's terms would in effect succumb to its vision of
Taiwan as a subservient province of the mainland Communist regime.
This is the context in which Mr. Chen's recent comments must be
understood. In the face of these unmistakable distortions of the
status quo over the past year -- and the growing threat posed by the
deployment of Chinese missiles aimed at Taiwan -- Mr. Chen has
countered by questioning the viability of an institution that has
little relevance to the current debate," the authors added.</P>
      <P>"One might expect that at this particularly volatile intersection
of diplomatic sensitivities and democratic politics, Mr. Chen could
have chosen a different course," the article said.</P>
      <P>"And while others have been willing to pursue unilateral actions
that could affect the future course and security of the region, he
has been true to perhaps the most admirable pledge - to leave such
decisions to Taiwan's 23 million inhabitants. In the context of
Taiwan's vibrant democracy, one could say that Mr. Chen's actions
have been quite diplomatic."</P>
      <P>"And far from a rebuke, " the authors wrote, "our government
should both acknowledge this, and -- given China's enduring threat --
show the kind of support that our democratic ally deserves." </P>
      <P>"For a country in which people are not allowed to google
'sensitive' words such as freedom or democracy, China has never
appealed to the hearts and souls of the Taiwanese people. The
Taiwanese people should have the final words on their own future. In
his State of the Union speech, President Bush said the United States
is committed to an historic, long-term goal -- we seek the end of
tyranny in our world. When Chinese President Hu Jintao comes to
Washington in April, we will applaud President Bush for his continued
efforts to speak about the democratic values embedded in this
country, " the article concluded.</P>

of St. Bernard town in Southern Leyte, burying

    <HEADLINE>TIME HAS COME FOR TAIWAN AND CHINA TO WORK TOWARD PEACE: KMT HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Brussels,  Feb. 17 (CNA)
(By Huan Tzu-chiang and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After years of tensions, it is time for
Taiwan and China to work towards a resolution for peace, Taipei Mayor
Ma Ying-jeou said Friday in the Belgian capital.</P>
      <P>Ma, who doubles as chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang,
said he has been thinking about ways to help both sides of the Taiwan
Strait get around their differences and achieve cross-strait peace.</P>
      <P>He said the views that he unveiled in his speech in Britain
earlier in the week were only a beginning and that he believes a more
complete conceptual framework will be formed gradually in the future.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during a gathering with Taiwan media before
departing from Belgium, the final leg of his five-nation Europe visit
that also took him to Italy, Switzerland, Britain and Ireland. He is
scheduled to return to Taipei Feb. 19.</P>
      <P>During a speech on cross-strait relations given Feb. 13 at the
London School of Economics and Political Science, Ma defined the
relationship between Taiwan and China as "equal political partners
under a 'one China' framework."</P>
      <P>Also in the speech, Ma said that if in the future China becomes
compatible with Taiwan in terms of its political, economic and social
development, the KMT would not rule out "ultimate unification" as an
option in cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>The speech has drawn harsh attacks from the pro-independence
"pan-green camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and
Taiwan Solidarity Union, which have accused Ma of downgrading the
status of Taiwan and acting as Beijing's mouthpiece.</P>
      <P>On the split national identity in Taiwan, Ma said Friday that the
nation should seek to solve the problem from a more liberal
perspective based on the concepts of peace, prosperity and democracy.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that the situation faced by Taiwan today is no better
than five or 10 years ago because of the domestic differences over
the question of unification versus independence and the low degree of
recognition enjoyed by the country internationally.</P>
      <P>He said the democratic development of Taiwan is one of the
country's most important assets and that Taiwan should make good use
of this asset to make other countries like and help Taiwan and should
avoid creating the impression that Taiwan is a "troublemaker."</P>
      <P>In addition, he said Taiwan should further enhance its
internationalization efforts and adopt a more open policy towards the
international community as well as China.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will donate US$100,000 for relief

    <HEADLINE>BANGLADESH COULD BE INTERMEDIARY TO SOUTH ASIAN MARKET: TIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 18 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Posting economic growth rates of more than
5 percent in recent years, Bangladesh could be a roaring tiger that
could serve as an intermediary for Taiwan businesses to enter the
South Asian, European, American, Australian and New Zealand markets,
the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to Wu Fu-cheng, deputy director of the TIER's
Department of International Affairs, the economy of Bangladesh has
been developing stably, and the high economic growth rate is very
impressive for a country with a huge population of 130 million.</P>
      <P>Bangladesh has become attractive to international investors owing
to its thriving manufacturing sector, which has registered growth
rates of more than 8 percent in recent years, and its stable
politics, Wu pointed out.</P>
      <P>With the South Asia free trade zone being established Jan. 1 this
year and an economic cooperation agreement set to be signed among
countries on the Bay of Bengal rim, exports from Bangladesh will
enjoy low custom duties or tariff-free treatment, which will boost
the competitiveness of Bangladesh exports, Wu said.</P>
      <P>All these advantages enjoyed by Bangladesh, coupled with the
World Trade Organization's requirement that developed countries grant
duty-free and quota-free treatment to products from underdeveloped
countries by 2008, have made Bangladesh an ideal intermediary to the
South Asian, European, American, Australian and New Zealand markets,
he said.</P>
      <P>On the sectors that Taiwan investors can target, Wu said that the
ready-to-wear clothing, textile, artificial fiber, pharmaceutical,
refrigerator, television, motorcycle and mobile phone industries all
have high potential.</P>
      <P>The low labor costs in Bangladesh, where wages average US$0.25
per hour, also make the country attractive to investors, he said.</P>
      <P>However, he warned that there are risks that investors should
take into account while considering setting up operations in
Bangladesh, and these include the inconsistencies between
Bangladesh's trade system and international norms, the frequent labor
strikes in Bangladesh, and gangsters' interference in Bangladesh's
economic activities.</P>

      <P>Fourteen Taiwan businesses have registered
to attend the second Vietnam International Precision Engineering,
Machine Tools and Metalworking Exhibition and Conference, also known
as MetalAsia (MTA) Vietnam 2006, slated to be held March 1-4 in Ho
Chi Minh City, southern Vietnam.</P>
      <P>The number is 27 percent higher than the number for last year's
event, officials from the semi-official Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the Taiwan group will attract more Vietnamese
buyers, including those from state-run enterprises, than in past
years as Taiwan-made machine tools have earned a good reputation in
the international market, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Around 350 businesses from more than 30 countries will attend the
MTA Vietnam 2006, which has drawn the attention of many of the
world's leading factories in the precision engineering and
metalworking industries due to Vietnam's economic status in the
region -- it is a member of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) and is expected to gain membership in the World Trade
Organization soon, the TAITRA said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been listed as the world's third largest producer of
parts and components for machine tools, behind only Japan and
Germany. Vietnam has been the eighth largest market for Taiwan
exports of such products.</P>
      <P>According to TAITRA statistics, Taiwan exported US$32.11 million
worth of machine tools to Vietnam in the first six months of last
year, posting a year-on-year growth of 83 percent.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
(DPP) position regarding the proposal for a new constitution for
Taiwan is to respect the will of the 23 million people of Taiwan, a
DPP official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-jun, a whip of the DPP caucus in the legislature, made
the remarks after President Chen Shui-bian said on Lunar New Year's
Day that it's time to seriously consider scrapping the country's
National Unification Council and its guidelines, applying for United
Nations membership under the name of Taiwan, and drawing up a new
constitution by the end of this year and holding a referendum on it
next year.</P>
      <P>President Chen stressed that these proposals are aimed at
underscoring the Taiwan identity.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-jun noted that pursuing a constitution which
corresponds with the Taiwan people's will is the DPP's top goal. The
party will therefore not limit the topics to be discussed regarding
the proposed new constitution, be it the issue of the national flag,
the nation's designation, the country's territory or anything else.</P>
      <P>"The party will respect the diverse opinions existing in Taiwan
society," the lawmaker added.</P>
      <P>Regarding the criticism from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) that
the constitution proposal by the president and the DPP is aimed at
soliciting voter support in the year-end Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral
elections, Chen Chin-jun stressed that it has nothing to do with the
elections, but rather with the intention of "making Taiwan a normal
country."</P>
      <P>As to media reports that U.S. high-ranking officials have warned
that President Chen will have to bear the consequences if he insists
on scrapping the National Unification Council and its guidelines,
which Beijing would see as a move toward independence, the lawmaker
noted that the U.S. government may not understand the real situation
in Taiwan and that Taipei will continue communicating with U.S.
officials in this regard through diplomatic channels.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has not received any warning from
the United States about the consequence if President Chen Shui-bian
insists on following through his proposal to scrap the National
Unification Council (NUC) and the National Unification Guidelines, a
Presidential Office spokesman said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-tsung, director of the Department of Public Affairs of
the Presidential Office, was responding to reports by the China
Times, a major local newspaper.</P>
      <P>The reports quoted an unidentified ranking official of the Bush
administration as warning if President Chen insists on abolishing the
NUC and its guidelines, he will have to face the "across-the-board"
consequences, including the impact on Taiwan-U.S.
relations, cross-strait relations as well as relations between Taiwan
and the international community.</P>
      <P>"We have no knowledge about who the official being quoted by the
media is, " Chen Wen-tsung said, adding that even if it is a senior
or ranking official, the comments were "just his personal view," and
not the official view of the United States.</P>
      <P>He said that since the president proposed the abolition of the 
NUC on Jan. 29, Taiwan has continued to communicate with the U.S.
side to allay its concerns, including with U.S. administration
officials, members of Congress, and think tank scholars.</P>
      <P>Michel Lu, a spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA),
also said Saturday that the ministry has not received any warning
message from the U.S. side, dismissing the media reports.</P>
      <P>A high-ranking U.S. State Department official recently reaffirmed
that Washington's policy toward Taiwan remains unchanged in the wake
of Chen's proposal.</P>
      <P>James Keith, senior advisor for the Bureau of East Asian and
Pacific Affairs, said that Washington expects Taipei to continue to
honor its commitment to maintain the cross-Taiwan Strait status quo
and that it will continue to communicate with Taipei to ensure there
will be "no surprises" between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Keith reiterated that the United States' "one-China policy"
remains unchanged and that Washington does not support Taiwan
independence and is opposed to any unilateral changes to the
cross-strait status quo.</P>
      <P>The NUC is an organ set up by the former Kuomintang
administration in 1990 to promote the eventual unification of Taiwan
and China and is therefore considered by Beijing as evidence that the
island is not moving toward de jure independence, which Beijing has
threatened to stop with force.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP TO DOUBLE NUMBER OF NOMINATIONS FOR VILLAGE, BOROUGH CHIEF POLLS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will double the number of the party's nominations for the
village and borough chief elections set for June, a DPP official said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung said that the party intends
to recruit 900 individuals and that it will target especially women,
youths and those who are dedicated to community development to
achieve the goal.</P>
      <P>With these people joining the election, Lin said, the DPP hopes
to build a solid foundation for the party to prepare it for the
legislative elections in late 2007, which will see the electoral
change from a "multiple seats in one constituency" to a "single
constituency" for the first time.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks in a spring gathering in Taichung,
central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin said the gathering, sponsored by the party for women's groups
in central Taiwan, is aimed at recruiting more women from central
Taiwan to join the elections, stressing the importance of the
elections.</P>
      <P>Villages and boroughs are the smallest administrative units in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that the DPP suffered a major setback in the Dec. 3
mayoral and magistrate elections, attributing the drubbing to a lack
of asolid foundation at the grass-roots level.</P>
      <P>"If we cannot work toward building a more solid foundation, we
won't be able to expand our support base," Lin said.</P>
      <P>He said that DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun has listed the building up
of the party's support at the grass-roots level as one of the party's
priorities, and this is why the DPP will encourage more talent to
join the village and borough chief elections.</P>
      <P>Anyone who represents the party will receive a subsidy of
NT$10,000 (US$310.6) for their election campaign, as well as other
incentives after their election, Lin said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  18 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In the government-organized campaign to
select an image to represent Taiwan internationally, glove puppetry
has emerged as the top choice of the people.</P>
      <P>The folk art has reportedly garnered roughly 130,000 votes, ahead
of Jade Mountain, or Yushan -- Taiwan's highest mountain, which
received some 110,000 votes.</P>
      <P>Voting in the Government Information Office-sponsored "Show
Taiwan to the World" campaign began Dec. 16 and wrapped up Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Vote counting is expected to be completed Feb. 20, with the
winner to be officially announced Feb. 23, according to the GIO.</P>
      <P>However, Yulin County Magistrate Su Chih-fen could not wait until
the official announcement to report the good news in person to the
107-year-old renowned glove puppetry master Huang Hai-tai at Huang's
home in the southwestern county Friday.</P>
      <P>Thanks to Huang, who dedicated his life and energy to promoting
glove puppetry, Yulin has become the country's center of the
traditional folk art. Huang, who was born in Huwei township in the
county, is a National Culture and Arts Awards winner.</P>
      <P>Su expressed her thanks to Huang and his son, Huang Jyun-syong,
as well as all other puppetry masters, who have spared no efforts to
preserve and promote glove puppetry and to turn the art form into
"the glory of the county." The young Huang was at the forefront of
the 1960s trend to modernize glove puppet theater for television.</P>
      <P>Su said she will work to set up a glove puppetry center in the
county during her tenure in an effort "to show Yulin to the world
with the local art."</P>

    <HEADLINE>OFFICIAL'S CRITICISM OF CHEN'S PROPOSAL NOT IN U.S. INTEREST: TSU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 18 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) legislator
said Saturday that a U.S. official's recent criticism regarding
President Chen Shui-bian's proposal of scrapping the country's
National Unification Council is not in the United States' interests.</P>
      <P>Huang Shih-cho, convener of the TSU caucus in the legislature,
made the remarks after an anonymous high-ranking U.S. official was
quoted as saying that President Chen will have to bear the
consequences if he insists on scrapping the National Unification
Council and its guidelines, which Beijing would see as a move toward
independence.</P>
      <P>The U.S. official was referring to Chen's remarks on Lunar New
Year's Day that it's time to seriously consider scrapping the
country's National Unification Council and its guidelines.</P>
      <P>Huang said he believes that the U.S. official was trying to
restrain Taiwan's "voices" at a time when the U.S. government needs
Beijing's support in dealing with several international issues,
including Iran, Iraq and North Korea.</P>
      <P>Such remarks only represent the viewpoint of some officials in
the U.S. administration, and not of all of American society, Huang
claimed.</P>
      <P>In his view, Huang said, only an alliance relationship in the
military, diplomatic and political spheres among Taiwan, the United
States and Japan can ensure Taiwan's sovereignty and security, which
is in the interests of the United States.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hwang Yih-jiau, whip of the opposition People First
Party (PFP) caucus in the legislature, said the PFP and the
Kuomintang, which form the opposition "pan-blue alliance, " will
promote a cross-strait peace bill to counter Chen's proposal to scrap
the National Unification Council and its guidelines. The "pan-blue
alliance holds a slight majority in the legislature,</P>
      <P>Commenting on Hwang Yih-jiau's plan, Huang Shih-cho said the
cross-strait peace bill is aimed at materializing the "one China"
concept, which he said the TSU strongly opposes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RISE IN GAS PRICES IN TAIWAN COMPARATIVELY MODERATE IN 2005: DGBAS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  18 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 8-percent rise in gasoline prices in
Taiwan during 2005 was fairly moderate when compared to the hikes
seen in other countries, officials of the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The United States saw gasoline prices surge 21.9 percent last
year, while prices in Japan and South Korea rose 23.5 percent and 9.0
percent, respectively, the DGBAS officials noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's gasoline price hike in 2005 was only higher than that of
Singapore, which stood at 5.4 percent, the officials added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DGBAS statistics showed that Taiwan's consumer price
index (CPI) last year registered a 2.3-percent growth over the
previous year's level due largely to the unstable weather which led
to price hikes of 29.8 percent and 19.3 percent for vegetables and
fruits, respectively.</P>
      <P>The island's CPI growth last year was higher than that of Japan,
which was negative 0.3 percent, and Singapore's 0.4 percent, but was
lower than United States' 3.4 percent and South Korea's 2.7 percent,
the officials noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN GAMERS VIE FOR TOP HONORS IN ONLINE GAME COMPETTION AT TGS 2006</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  18 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 304 Taiwanese gamers will vie
for top honors at the Taipei Digital Game Championship, a national
competition at the Taipei Game Show 2006 (TGS 2006), this weekend.</P>
      <P>The gamers from north and south, already the cream of the crop,
winning their respective regional tournaments that saw a total of
36,443 competitors, gathered in Taipei for the national championship
tournament. Winners of the six different online games will be
determined Sunday.</P>
      <P>"We hope to promote the digital content industry through this
competition, the first computer games tournament sponsored by the
government, " Deputy Director General of the Industrial Development
Bureau (IDB) Shen Jung-jin said.</P>
      <P>"Governmental assistance has stimulated the energy of the digital
content industry," said Henry Hsieh, marketing manager of Electronic
Arts Taiwan (EA Taiwan) . EA Taiwan is presenting "NBA Live 06", one
of the most popular games in Taiwan, at the competition.</P>
      <P>"Online games are becoming more and more popular among those of
the younger generation who are familiar with computers, as evidenced
by the increasing number of visitors at this event, " Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Organizers have estimated that more than 100,000 visitors and
industry professionals will visit the TGS 2006, which ends on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh envisions booming success for the industry in the coming
years. "Computer game sales were down approximately 10 percent in the
past year because of the transitional period between the old and new
consoles, such as Sony's PlayStation 2 (PS2) and PS3 and Microsoft's
Xbox and Xbox 360. Most users are waiting for the new models. But the
future is looking good, " Hsieh noted.</P>
      <P>However, he also expressed some concerns. "Piracy is still the
biggest concern for us. Most gamers are students who are more than
willing to try as many computer games as they can but don't have
enough money to buy the software. That's why they download illegal
software," he said.</P>
      <P>The TGS, organized by the Taipei Computer Association (TCA), is
the second largest international PC/console game show in Asia and
attracts an average of 500,000 visitors annually. This year's event
features booths hosted by over 150 of Asia's leading PC/console game
developers.</P>

      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang expressed his
condolences Saturday for the victims of a massive landslide in
Guinsaugon village on Leyte Island in the central Philippines.</P>
      <P>Su instructed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) and the

reports concerning the deadly mudslide from members of his Cabinet,
Minister of Government Information Office Cheng Wen-tsang said.</P>
      <P>Guinasugon village, which is home to thousands of people, was

    <HEADLINE>SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND 2006 TAIPEI GAME SHOW BRING GAMERS TOGETHER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  18 (CNA)
(By Debby Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A sense of belonging and of community is
what brings online gamers together, gamers and game creators taking
part in the 2006 Taipei Game show said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The 2006 Taipei Game Show is being held at the Taipei World
Trade Center Feb.16-20.</P>
      <P>Online game banners and advertisements dominate the exhibition
hall. Booths featuring a wide variety of the latest online games,
from World of Warcraft to Lineage II, have been set up at the
exhibition, with first-class computers and Internet connections to
attract Taiwanese gamers to give the games a try.</P>
      <P>The super-sized LCD screens at the booths are showing the
magnificent demos of the latest 3D online games, each with more
delicate colors, better graphics, more action, and a more realistic
feel than the earlier versions. As the game soundtracks are played at
full blast, show girls in sexy outfits try to attract visitors, most
of whom are males, to the booths.</P>
      <P>Gamers have been flocking around the booths to try out the new
games and hopefully win one of the many prizes up for grabs. Only a
few PC consoles are being featured, but among them is PlayStation 3,
which still attracts huge crowds for a sneak preview of the latest
game offerings.</P>
      <P>Bahamut Gamer's Community Vice Director Carson Chen pointed out
that production of PC games has been declining, while that of online
games has been going up over the past few years. Bahamut is a leading
Internet game forum in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, Chen also said that the market for massive multiplayer
online role-playing games (MMORPG) is showing signs of saturation,
and game creators have started to come up with smaller "casual games"
such as poker and mahjong.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that online games have become popular due to the
strong interest of both gamers and game creators.</P>
      <P>"The online game provides the gamers with a sense of community,
which PC games cannot achieve. Meanwhile, for the game creators, they
do not have to worry about their games being pirated since their
revenues mainly come from the gamers' monthly payments," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Ray Lee, a section chief in NC Taiwan's marketing department,
also highlighted the prominence of online game communities. NC Taiwan
is a branch of Korea's leading online game company NCsoft. NCsoft's
two masterpiece online games, Lineage and Lineage II, are both very
popular in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Gamers become addicted to online games because the games are
simulations of a real society. Gamers get sucked in by the unity
demonstrated by the virtual communities, " said Lee, who is also a
loyal player of Lineage II.</P>
      <P>"The friendships I have made online are simple. We have simple
topics for chatting, and we have the same goal. As time goes by, we
also develop a good understanding of each other because we spend a
long time playing the game together," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Little T and his girlfriend Shui Yun (Alias) , two online gamers
lining up in a big crowd for the latest Sony PlayStation 3 demo film,
said they feel a strong sense of community in online gaming. The two
played the same online game and met each other at a real-life game
gathering arranged by Bahamut.</P>
      <P>"Online games are like massive chat rooms. I like to follow the
latest game gossip. It's more interesting than meaningless political
arguments, " said Shui Yun, who is in her first year of high school.
She said she started playing online games after seeing her friends
play.</P>
      <P>"In online games, the friends you make only know a side of you,
and you can play any person you want to your heart's desire, " she
said.</P>
      <P>Her boyfriend, a college freshman, agreed. "I'm attracted to
online games mostly because I can interact with new friends. The
other gamers do not know your real identities, and that's part of the
fun," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT QUESTIONS DPP'S MOTIVE IN PROMOTING NEW CONSTITUTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  18  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said Saturday that the rigorous promotion
of a new constitution by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) is only to promote the party's own interests.</P>
      <P>Several KMT legislators, including Pang Wei-kang, a KMT caucus
whip, questioned the DPP's motive after DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun said
recently that the party will unveil its own version of a new
constitution in June in conformity with President Chen Shui-bian's
call Jan. 29 to draft a new constitution this year to be put to a
referendum in 2007.</P>
      <P>Yu also said that the DPP's version of a new constitution could
touch on such sensitive issues as the national flag and the nation's
designation.</P>
      <P>Pang alleged that the strenuous promotion by President Chen and
the DPP of a new constitution is a "desperate gamble" by them.</P>
      <P>Saying that the DPP is desperately trying to regain the
initiative on issues in the wake of its drubbing in the Dec. 3 local
elections, she claimed that "the real purpose of promoting the new
constitution is to drum up support for the DPP in the year-end Taipei
and Kaohsiung mayoral elections."</P>
      <P>Although the constitutional re-engineering office under the
Presidential Office has said it will kick off "10,000 seminars around
the island" to get the public's input for the new constitution, Pang 
claimed the seminars will only be about "endorsing the DPP's version
of a new constitution."</P>
      <P>Since the "new constitution is but a facade" to boost the DPP's
chances of winning in the elections, she suggested that the DPP might
as well scrap the seminars and save the money for other more useful
purposes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHOULD REACH OUT TO WORLD, NOT LOCK ITSELF TO CHINA: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should reach out to the world, not
"lock itself to China, " Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Wu was responding to opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou's remarks in Europe Friday that Taiwan will only thrive by
opening up to China.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Ma's comments were seriously misleading, Wu said
the problem facing Taiwan nowadays is its heavy investment in China
and mounting reliance on the Chinese market rather than the issue of
"opening up" to China.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, up to 70 percent of Taiwan's outbound investment
in recent years has flowed to China, the highest ratio among major
countries around the world. It is estimated that Taiwan's accumulated
investment in China has reached NT$5 trillion and two-way trade
across the Taiwan Strait now accounts for a quarter of Taiwan's total
foreign trade. Moreover, nearly 1 million Taiwan people have taken up
residence in China.</P>
      <P>Wu said all these figures indicate that the government has not
imposed any unreasonable restrictions on China-bound investment and
cross-strait trade as opposition politicians claimed. To the
contrary, he noted, Taiwan now faces the risks of "locking its
economic lifeline to China."</P>
      <P>Since the peaceful transition of power in Taiwan in 2000, Wu
said, the government has spared no effort to promote economic reform
as well as market liberalization and globalization. Besides easing
restrictions formulated in the 1980s and the 1990s, the government
has also worked hard to push for market diversification to mitigate
the possible risks of concentrating investment in China.</P>
      <P>As a maritime nation, Taiwan has never in its history tried to
shut itself off from the rest of the word, Wu said, adding that he
suspects that Ma might be pushing to use "unconditionally" embracing
China as a measurement to gauge whether Taiwan's economic policy is
globalized enough.</P>
      <P>Ma was in Brussels Friday on the last leg of his five-naton
Europe visit in his capacity as mayor of Taipei to attract foreign
investment in Taiwan's capital city.</P>
      <P>Wu said he wonders why Ma had not focused his efforts to woo
European investors and had instead pushing for Taiwan's further
opening to China.</P>
      <P>"While China has relentlessly suppressed and semared Taiwan in
the international community, Ma should have taken advantage of his
Europe visit to voice protest against China's diplomatic embargo
against Taiwan, " Wu said, adding that simply because of Beijing's
pressure, Greece authorities had rejected Ma's planned stop in Athens
during his current trip.</P>
      <P>Wu also reminded Ma that China, not Taiwan, is troublemaker
because all of the stirs in the Taiwan Strait have resulted from
China's suppression against Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Philippine government has expressed its
gratitude for Taiwan's aid for its landslide victims, the Republic of
China's representative office in Manila said Saturday.</P>
      <P>A batch of emergency health kits donated by Taiwan's Department
of Health (DOH) arrived in Manila in the evening via a China Airlines
flight. It was the first shipment of foreign relief goods to arrive
in Manila since the landslide tragedy was reported Friday.</P>
      <P>The medical supply will be sent to the disaster zone in
Guinsaugon on Leyte Island, some 670 kilometers southeast of Manila,
by a Philippine military transport plane Sunday morning along with a
30-member Taiwan rescue team who will arrive in Manila Sunday
morning.</P>
      <P>The farming village of Guinasugon was virtually wiped out when a
rain-soaked mountainside disintegrated in a wall of mud and boulders
Friday. More than 1,400 people were reported missing, with many of
them feared dead.</P>
      <P>After receiving a request for post-disaster relief aid from the
Philippine authorities Friday evening, Wu Hsin-hsing, Taiwan's
representative in Manila, immediately conveyed the message back to
Taipei.</P>
      <P>Under ROC President Chen Shui-bian's instruction, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs has donated US$100,000 to help fund post-disaster
relief programs, while the DOH donated 15,000 emergency health kits,
worth NT$3 million. The International Headquarters SAR Taiwan agreed
to send a 30-member rescue team to search for survivors.</P>
      <P>Wu said he has conveyed condolences to the Philippine landslide
victims on behalf of the ROC government. According to Wu, the ROC
government will decide whether to offer more relief aid in terms of
subsequent demand.</P>

      <P>An alliance of advocacy groups dedicated to
immigrant and migrant worker rights protection will call a news
conference Monday to push for law revisions to better protect
residency rights of new female immigrants, a spokesman said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Claiming that current Taiwan immigration regulations have not

foreign spouses of Taiwan citizens, the spokesman said the alliance
will ask relevant government agencies to establish a legal mechanism
to protect disadvantaged new female immigrants.</P>
      <P>Current Taiwan regulations authorize city/county government
agencies to extend residency permits for widowed foreign spouses and
those who have endured malignantly tragic divorce.</P>
      <P>As local authorities possess great discretion, the spokesman said
many new female immigrants who meet those requirements still have
difficulties getting residency permits after divorce.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the spokesman claimed that some abused
foreign spouses dare not seek divorce or come forward to report their
plights.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the alliance will push for inclusion of a

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should maintain the status quo in
its relationship with China at present, instead of seeking immediate
unification or permanent separation, Ma Ying-jeou, chairman of the
main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Ma, who also serves as Taipei mayor, made the remarks at an
airport press conference after returning with a business promotion
group from an 11-day five-nation European tour.</P>
      <P>He clarified that the KMT favors maintaining the status quo in
the Taiwan Strait and that Taiwan's independence has never been one
of the KMT's options, although the party acknowledged in a recent
newspaper advertisement that Taiwan's independence should be seen as
one of the people's options.</P>
      <P>Ma stressed that unification with China will have to wait until
all conditions become mature, including the people's consent.</P>
      <P>"That's what I have always said, and that has never changed," he
said.</P>
      <P>In response to criticism by Joseph Wu, chairman of the

called Taiwan "a troublemaker" while he was in Europe, the KMT
chairman explained that the term was used by a senior official of the
European Union who was observing cross-strait relations from the
standpoint of Europeans.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan should not create any more surprises for its
foreign friends and allies, and that neither side of the Strait

    <TEXT>
      <P>A charity photo exhibition by a young
photographer is taking place in Taipei from Feb. 18 to March 11 to
raise funds for Cambodian children.</P>
      <P>A total of 38 photographs taken in Cambodia by Jack Lee will be
displayed in the show, "Angkorel's Smile 2." All proceeds will be
donated to the Field Relief Agency of Taiwan (FRA), a non-profit non-
governmental organization (NGO) devoted exclusively to humanitarian
relief work in Cambodia.</P>
      <P>This is the second exhibition Lee has set up to raise funds for
children in Cambodia, where Lee twice visited in 2004 and 2005. Lee,
a print media photographer, went to Camdodia for a sightseeing tour
in 2004 and said he was "touched beyond words" by the suffering of
Cambodians.</P>
      <P>"I didn't realize until then there was such a war-torn country in
this world where people couldn't even afford to have the basic needs
in life, such as food, accommodation and education. I was shocked,"
Lee said.</P>
      <P>"So I decided to do something for them, " said Lee, who after the
first trip set up a charity photography exhibition titled "Angkorel's
Smile, " which means "angelic smile of Cambodian children" by
combining the words "Angkor" -- a famous Cambodian city -- and
"Angel."</P>
      <P>Lee, now an FRA volunteer worker, visited Cambodia again with the
FRA last September. Most photographs were taken in Poipet, a
poverty-stricken border town in northwestern Cambodia.</P>
      <P>"Jack has a big heart. What he did helps us understand that it
makes no difference whether we are Russians, Americans or Taiwanese
-- we feel a lot happier when we extend a helping hand to people, "
said Galya Kharitonova, a Russian exchange student at Tamkang
University who has known Lee for two years.</P>
      <P>The photography exhibition takes place at Nook Cafe, 7-1, Lane

      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP)
warned Sunday that if President Chen Shui-bian insisted on abolishing
the National Unification Council, the PFP caucus at the legislature
would push for the passage of a bill to promote peace between Taiwan
and China and maintain the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Daniel Hwang, convener of the PFP's legislative caucus, told
reporters that the PFP will continue to work with its "pan-blue
alliance" partner, the Kuomintang (KMT), during the new legislative
session to maintain cross-strait peace and stability.</P>
      <P>He said the legislative caucuses of the two opposition parties
will also prioritize passing legislation that would benefit people's
livelihood, including the bill calling for direct trade, postal and
transportation links between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>To prevent the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government from
squandering public funds through its second-stage financial reforms,
the PFP caucus will work out measures to safeguard the people's
rights, Hwang said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the "pan-blue alliance" in the legislature will
introduce an amendment to the existing law governing the discharge of
duties of the Legislative Yuan by late March when the negotiation
over the legislation between the DPP caucus and the opposition
caucuses comes to an end.</P>
      <P>He said the amendment, after becoming law, will turn the
Legislative Yuan into "a tiger with teeth" by giving it the power to
summon government officials, investigate irregularities and hold
public hearings.</P>

      <P>Kung Teh-cheng, Confucius' 77th-generation descendant who is the

      <P>The "sacred rites official" is a government post held from

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb.  19 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Sunday that
the truth uncovered in a newly released report on the 1947 "228
Incident" is conducive to justice, social harmony and forgiveness.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while speaking at a ceremony marking the
research report's release by the government-funded 228 Incident
Memorial Foundation. The report's objective was to identify those
responsible for a government crackdown that took place following the
Feb. 28 incident and resulted in the killing of some 30,000 people in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The report named Chiang Kai-shek, president at the time, as the
No. 1 culprit for sending soldiers into Taiwan from China for the
brutal crackdown.</P>
      <P>The report also concluded that then-governor of Taiwan Chen Yi
and two military leaders -- Peng Meng-chi, commander of the fort of
Kaoshiung, and Ke Yuan-fen, chief of staff of the Taiwan Garrison
Command -- should also share the blame.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident was triggered by a dispute involving Monopoly
Bureau officials who tried to confiscate smuggled cigarettes from a
woman vendor in Taipei. The vender was injured and an innocent
bystander was killed in the skirmish, prompting mass street
demonstrations and clashes between local residents and mainlanders. A
week later, Chiang imposed martial law and sent troops to Taiwan for
the crackdown.</P>
      <P>President Chen noted that people today tend to neglect those
responsible for the tragedy because the families of the victims in
the brutal crackdown have already received compensation from the
government.</P>
      <P>He said the incident was a "permanent trauma in the hearts of
Taiwanese people," and that only by re-establishing the historical
facts of the incident could people learn real lessons from them and
build a national identity.</P>

      <P>Forty-four exchange students who travelled
to the United States to learn from their American counterparts while
introducing U.S. children to aspects of traditional Chinese culture
spoke of their experiences at a press conference Sunday.</P>
      <P>The three-week program ending Feb. 8 sent Taiwanese school
children ages 10 to 15 to visit their American peers in Portland,
Oregon and Los Angeles, California. The exchange program was
organized by the King Car Education Foundation and sponsored by King
Car Group, a leading Taiwanese beverage company.</P>
      <P>The foundation's director, Morgan Sun, said the purpose of the
program was to allow Taiwanese children to experience a different
style of education. The group followed a schedule evenly divided
between experiencing education in the U.S., and in exchange, teaching
other children talents such as Chinese calligraphy, traditional
dances and games.</P>
      <P>"English education is very common in Taiwan, but it seems that
the purpose of learning English here is only for exams. This program
sends children to the U.S. and gives them the opportunity to practice
the language through teaching other children -- while also giving
them a broader vision of the world," said Sun.</P>
      <P>Ten-year-old Ruby Song, the youngest of the group, tried to
introduce her foreign friends to the game of diabolo.</P>
      <P>She said at first she experienced great difficulty in finding the
right words in English to explain to others how to play the game, but
while teaching she found a way to translate the tips her diabolo
teacher taught her in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Fourteen year-old Hsiao Ping said that while she was attending a
math class during the program, U.S. school children seemed to
calculate slower with a calculator than she did by memorization.</P>
      <P>"But the difference is that they really understand math exercises
from the basic concepts, which is also what I learned from them -- to
learn basic concepts about everything," she said.</P>
      <P>The exchange program is held twice a year, in summer and winter.
This is the third time that King Car Education Foundation has
organized such a trip for children.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has managed to bring incidence of
end-stage kidney disease under control and the death rate of local
renal dialysis patients is far lower than those recorded in many
advanced countries, according to a report issued Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Society of Nephrology (TSN) released the report at a
ceremony commending 17 outstanding long-term dialysis patients who
have courageously coped with their daily living well despite their
disease.</P>
      <P>The report said Taiwan has some 40,000 to 50,000 renal disease
patients who have to undergo blood dialysis or peritoneal dialysis
which cost more than NT$25 billion in national health insurance
payment a year.</P>
      <P>Dialysis expense is indeed a heavy financial burden for the
national health insurance program, but the report noted that dialysis
treatment has helped lower incidence of end-stage renal diseases and
the death rate among the recipients of such treatment.</P>
      <P>Analyzing official tallies for 2002 and 2003, the report said the
incidence of terminal-stage renal diseases dropped from 352 per 1
million persons in 2002 to 352 in 2003. The decline was especially
conspicuous among those aged between 45 and 74.</P>
      <P>The report also pointed out that the death rate among those who
underwent blood dialysis was about 8.15 percent and 6.31 percent
among those who underwent peritoneal dialysis, far lower than an
average of 32.17 percent in the United States and 15.6 percent in
Europe.</P>
      <P>In neighboring Hong Kong, the report said, the death rates for
blood dialysis and peritoneal dialysis were 14 percent and 11
percent, respectively, both higher than Taiwan's.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the report said Taiwan still had the world's second
highest incidence rate of end-stage renal diseases. TSN President
Huang Chiu-chin attributed the phenomenon to a combination of
factors, including that more uremic patients can now live longer by
receiving dialysis treatment under the national health insurance
program and an increase in elderly population.</P>
      <P>Quoting a U.S. study, Huang said that in the United States, renal
disease patients who died of cardiovascular diseases before receiving
dialysis was 16 times those who died of kidney diseases. In Taiwan,
incidence of cardiovascular diseases is far lower than that in the
United States and the survival rate among dialysis patients is
generally higher. As a result, Huang said Taiwan has a relatively
higher incidence of end-stage renal diseases.</P>
      <P>Huang further said those who want to avoid kidney diseases should
eat more vegetables, more fruits and more fish and drink more clean
water while eating less fat, less salt and less sugar.</P>
      <P>At Sunday's ceremony, 17 patients who have undergone blood or
peritoneal dialysis for more than 15 years were awarded for their
courage and perseverance in fighting their renal diseases.</P>
      <P>Among the award winners was Chen Tien-sheng who have received
regular dialysis treatment for 21 years. Chen, who has lost his
eyesight because of mistreatment of his kidney disease in the initial
stage and now operate a personal massage workshop, said he has drawn
many inspirations through all these years of enduring the pains of
the disease and various medical treatment.</P>
      <P>"I strive to maintain health by regular exercise and study of
Buddhist scriptures," Chen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S SNAKE SERUM WELL-KNOWN THROUGHOUT WORLD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 19 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although few in Taiwan are aware of it, the
island is known around the world as a vital supplier of a snake serum
known as antivenin, used in the treatment of poisonous snake bites,
an official from the Department of Health's Snake Serum Producing
Center said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The center's director, Miao Po-ling, said the quality of the
center's serum was demonstrated by regular orders coming in from the
United States, Germany and Italy.</P>
      <P>The serum is frequently sought overseas because Taiwan is home to
several poisonous snakes, which are often unique to the island.</P>
      <P>Some serpents specific to Taiwan include a cobra known as the
spoon snake, the banded krait snake, the chain snake, the conehead
snake, a type of rattlesnake and the red-tail loach.</P>
      <P>All are endangered species and protected by law except for the
red-tail loach. Over 70 poisonous snakes are kept at the center for
the collection of venom, a process regulated and monitored by
the Council of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>The center's veterinarians gather venom once a month from the
snakes, which are maintained in an air-conditioned, comfortable and
healthy habitat.</P>
      <P>Creating antivenin involves injecting a horse with a small amount
of the venom and extracting blood containing antibodies that can
fight the poison.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CNA WILLING TO FACE PUBLIC JUDGMENT ON ITS ROLE IN 228 INCIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb.  19  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central News Agency respects the
historical analysis of the 1947 "228 Incident" as outlined in a newly
released report and is willing to face judgment by the public on the
role the CNA might have played at the time, the publicly owned news
agency said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The CNA was formerly a news agency owned by the Nationalist Party
(Kuomintang), but became a corporate entity in 1996 and has since
dedicated itself solely to providing a variety of news services, the
CNA said in a statement.</P>
      <P>Whatever the CNA had done -- whether positive or negative --
during the period when the ruling KMT regime was effectively a
one-party state, the news agency is willing to face public evaluation
of its record from all sectors, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>The CNA is Taiwan's independently run news agency, with
correspondents posted in more than 30 cities around the world. It is
financed through a combination of public funds and media
subscriptions.</P>
      <P>The CNA statement was made in response to a research report
released by the government-funded 228 Incident Memorial Foundation,
which alleged that "secret telegrams" filed by the CNA's Taipei
office to the KMT government in Nanjing about the situation in Taiwan
following the 1947 incident were declassified in 1992, and claimed
that the CNA suggested sending troops from the Chinese mainland to
Taiwan for the crackdown.</P>
      <P>The report blamed Yeh Ming-shiun, then director of the CNA's
Taipei Office, for filing news reports reflecting the standpoint of
Taiwan's governor at the time, Chen Yi, thus failing to provide the
central government with accurate information.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on the allegation, Yeh explained that the
so-called "secret telegrams" were merely news reports filed as
reference material for government decision-makers, and that the
practice did not necessarily mean that the CNA was an
intelligence-gathering agency, as depicted in the report.</P>
      <P>Yeh said he had not yet read the report, but would bear no grudge
against any claims the report made about the CNA's role in the
incident.</P>
      <P>Insisting that he has always treated people sincerely and
honestly, he said he "has experienced too many big waves in his life"
and therefore will be able to come to peace with himself over such "a
small thing."</P>
      <P>The research report also named then President Chiang Kai-shek as
the "major culprit" for having sent soldiers to Taiwan, and said that
several military leaders stationed on the island at the time should
also share the blame for the tragedy.</P>
      <P>The Feb. 28, 1947 incident was sparked by a skirmish in which
Monopoly Bureau officials attempting to confiscate cigarettes led to
the injury of a woman vendor and the death of an innocent bystander,
prompting mass demonstrations and clashes all over Taiwan between
locals and mainlanders.</P>
      <P>Troops from China moved into Taiwan on March 8 and began a brutal
crackdown that resulted in the deaths of some 30,000 people.</P>

      <P>Two Taiwan citizens nabbed in Bangkok last
week are currently being held in Thai police custody on drug
trafficking charges, Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) officials
said Monday.</P>
      <P>The two Taiwanese men, surnamed Yang and Lin, were arrested at
Bangkok's international airport Feb. 17 after being discovered trying
to smuggle some 2.6 kilograms of high-grade heroin out of the country
in four plastic bags taped to their waists, the CIB officials said.</P>
      <P>The heroin has an street value of NT$30 million (US$928,792).</P>
      <P>According CIB officials in charge of international affairs, Yang
and Lin were paid US$10,000 by a drug ring -- which includes a Taiwan
drug lord and a Malaysian go-between -- to smuggle the heroin from
Thailand to Taiwan. The two men arrived in Thailand in mid-February.</P>
      <P>The CIB officials said that the drugs would not have been
discovered without the assistance of narcotics control authorities
from Thailand and the United States.</P>
      <P>Yang and Lin are expected to face trial in Bangkok and be

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN MUM ON REPORTS ABOUT 228 INCIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou on Monday declined to respond to a newly released book that
said the late KMT leader and Republic of China President Chiang
Kai-shek was the mastermind of the tragic 228 Incident which occurred
in Taiwan in 1947.</P>
      <P>Ma, who doubles as Taipei mayor, was also silent Monday over news
reports saying that the private opinion-leader group the Taiwan North
Society is planning to sue the KMT for NT$5 billion (US$154 million)
in compensation for damages wrought by the 228 Incident by filing
either a civil or criminal suit.</P>
      <P>Ma said that he will ask relevant units under the KMT
headquarters to make responses after he reads the book.</P>
      <P>Citing declassified official documents, the 590-page book, titled
"The 228 Incident: A Report on Responsibility, " indicates that the
KMT should be held responsible for the 228 Incident because the
party's leaders at the time of the massacre -- then president Chiang
Kai-shek and then Taiwan Governor Chen Yi -- were its masterminds.</P>
      <P>The book argues that Chiang ordered troops to be dispatched from
China to "maintain order" in Taiwan because protests, which had
spread out from Taipei to other areas around the island, were deemed
"treasonous."</P>
      <P>The book contends that the military crackdown against the
uprising was a criminal act committed by the KMT and that the
government has the right to bring the former ruling party to justice,
even though the statute of limitations is 20 years.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident is named after the rebellion against the KMT's
"venal and brutal" rule which was sparked on Feb. 28, 1947, according
to the book. It has been estimated that some 30,000 people were
killed directly as a resutl of the 228 Incident.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT DEMANDS NEW PROSECUTOR-GENERAL PROBE 'FIVE MAJOR SCANDALS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) demanded Monday that whoever is named new state
public prosecutor-general should form a special investigative team to
get the facts about what it claims are "five major scandals, "
including the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) debacle and the
"stock vultures" scandal.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor-General Wu Ying-chao tendered his resignation in
December to take responsibility over rampant vote buying and other
irregularities during the Dec. 3 local government elections. The
government has hinted it will name Wu's replacement by the end of
this month.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chin-lung, deputy secretary-general of the KMT caucus, said
the country cannot be without a prosecutor-general for a single day
and claimed that Wu's resignation, which was approved by President
Chen Shui-bian, has led to the suspension of executions of criminals
and the handling of emergency appeals, as well as hindering
investigations into major scandals.</P>
      <P>He claimed that people suspect that the president has been
delaying the appointment of a new prosecutor-general in an attempt to
block efforts to probe the scandals.</P>
      <P>In addition to the KRTC and "stock vultures" cases, the KMT said
eight banking institutions' huge loans to the Taiwan High Speed Rail
Corp. (THSRC), Chung Hwa Telecom's sale of stocks in violation of the
legislature's resolution, and the awarding of the contract to provide
electronic toll collection services on freeways to a conglomerate are
major scandals that must be thoroughly investigated.</P>
      <P>As the appointment of the prosecutor-general must win the
approval of the legislature in order to be valid and the KMT and its
People First Party "pan-blue alliance" partner enjoy a slim majority
in the Legislative Yuan, the KMT caucus said the new appointee must
pledge to get to the bottom of the "five major scandals" before it
will approve the appointment.</P>
      <P>"We will turn down a nominee who shows no guts and dares not
probe major scandals," Tsai said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS SHOW STEADY GROWTH IN 2005: FOUNDATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Cross-strait relations in the past year
showed "steady growth, " according to a report on the climate of
cross-strait peace in 2005 unveiled Monday.</P>
      <P>Chien Hsi-chieh, executive director of the Peacetime Foundation
of Taiwan, unveiled the report prepared by the foundation at a news
conference.</P>
      <P>He noted that over the past year, the incidents that had a
negative impact on cross-strait relations included China's enactment
of the anti-secession law which codifies the use of force against
Taiwan should the island move toward formal independence, Beijing's
deployment of 784 missiles targeting Taiwan, its crackdown on human
rights, and its press censorship.</P>
      <P>While in Taiwan, a major arms procurement project has turned into
persistent political squabbling between the ruling and the opposition
parties, Chien said.</P>
      <P>But he also pointed out that several incidents had a positive
impact on cross-strait ties, including a meeting between President
Chen Shui-bian and opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong
in February 2005 in which they agreed that the national status of the
Republic of China as stated in the Constitution defines the de facto
and de jure status quo across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Both Chen and Soong also said that abiding by the Constitution,
maintaining the status quo and promoting peace should be the guiding
principles for cross-strait relations, Chien added.</P>
      <P>Other incidents included the visits of two main opposition
leaders -- former Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan and Soong -- to
China in the first half of 2005, both sides of the Taiwan Strait
discussed cross-strait chartered flight service during the Chinese
New Year holiday, several private groups sponsored cross-strait
forums, and China granted tariff free treatment to 15 items of
agricultural products from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On President Chen's proposal to scrap the National Unification
Council (NUC) and the National Unification Guidelines, Chien also
suggested solicitation of views from the public through democratic
procedure to quell controversy and to propose more positive measures
to solicit cross-strait peace dialogue.</P>
      <P>The NUC is an organization set up by the former Kuomintang
administration in 1990 to promote the eventual unification of Taiwan
and China and is therefore considered by Beijing as evidence that the
island is not moving toward de jure independence, which Beijing has
threatened to stop with force. Chien said that the NUC and its
guidelines have only symbolic meaning, noting that President Chen has
never convened an NUC meeting since assuming the presidency in 2000.</P>
      <P>Hsu Shih-chien, an assistant researcher at Academia Sinica, the
nation's highest academic research institute, said that "common
values of the public" is the cornerstone of cross-strait peace.</P>
      <P>Noting that human rights, freedom and democracy are the common
values of the public, Hsu suggested that Taiwan's government be
concerned more about China's crackdown on human rights.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, former vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs
Council and presently executive director of the think tank Foundation
on International &amp; Cross-strait Studies, said that Taiwan
authorities' support for Chinese civil rights activists in China has
been too little.</P>
      <P>Noting that on the question of whether there will be
unification, "the time is on the side of the people," and that the 
government should formulate its cross-strait policy based on
the common interests of both sides of the Taiwan Strait, Lin urged
the government to focus its concern on China's democratic and human
rights situations, he added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
dismissed Monday reports that this year's computer war games will
simulate a scenario of China's invasion and occupation of Taiwan in
2008.</P>
      <P>MND spokesman Liu Chih-chien said the computer war games, part of
this year's Han Kuang No. 22 military exercise, is still in the
planning stage, and has yet to be finalized.</P>
      <P>"Any reports on the annual drill are mere speculation," he said.</P>
      <P>He was responding to reports by the China Times, a local major
newspaper, that this year's military drill will simulate China's
invasion of Taiwan after it successfully sponsors the Beijing
Olympics and Chinese President Hu Jintao is re-elected as the
national leader in 2008. The war games will test if Taiwan is capable
of withstanding the invading Chinese forces for two weeks without
outside assistance, the reports also said.</P>
      <P>"The ministry is still captiously studying the Han Kuang No. 22,"
Liu said, adding that the MND is scheduled to announce its plan in
early March.</P>
      <P>On reports that former commander of the U.S. Pacific
Command, Adm. Dennis Blair, will lead a military delegation to Taiwan
to observe the military drill as in the past year, Liu also said that
the matter has yet to be finalized.</P>
      <P>He said that the computer war games are aimed at simulating the
ministry's defensive warfare plan and testing the results of training
for joint operations of the armed forces.</P>
      <P>The "Han kuang No. 22" will continue with live fire exercises in
Ilan, northeastern Taiwan, in the later half of this year, the
reports also said.</P>

(By Debby Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Chinese dissident in Taiwan sought to join
the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Monday, but his application was
rejected by the party.</P>
      <P>Chen Rongli, a Chinese pro-democracy activist who was jailed in
China for taking part in organizing a new political party and came to
Taiwan seeking asylum in January 2004, visited KMT party headquarters
Monday to hand in his membership application.</P>
      <P>"The KMT is a party of the Three Principles of the People, and I
am a believer in the principles, "Chen said, explaining why he wants
to join the KMT.</P>
      <P>But the KMT turned down Chen's application because Chen does not
have Taiwan citizenship and has only the right of residence in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Huang Chung-hsien, a section chief of KMT's organization and
development committee said that according to the Civil Organizations
Law and KMT party charter, those without Taiwan citizenship cannot
join the KMT. But Huang also said the party will study the case
further to see whether Chen can join the KMT legally.</P>
      <P>The Civil Organizations Law stipulates that a political party
must consist only of Republic of China citizens.</P>
      <P>"According to the Constitution, both Taiwan and China are part of
the Republic of China. Chinese people are also Republic of China
people. I am completely qualified to become a KMT member, " Chen
claimed. Chen said he was told that there should be a decision made
regarding his application within one month.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said earlier this month in an interview
with the BBC that he would not exclude the possibility of allowing
people from China to become KMT members.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS CALLS FOR BETTER PROTECTION FOR NEW IMMIGRANTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>New immigrant women whose husbands have
died and those who have been abandoned or have suffered from domestic
violence should be granted permanent residence, a human rights group
said Monday in a press conference held to urge the Taiwan government
to establish better protection for foreign spouses.</P>
      <P>The Alliance on the Amendments of the Human Rights Protection Law
(AAHRPL) also asked the National Police Administration (NPA) to
clarify the administrative procedures used in considering whether to
grant extended residence to foreign spouses.</P>
      <P>"Most foreign spouses whose husbands have died have been having
trouble trying to stay in Taiwan. Either the husband's family has
refused to apply for extended residence for them or their
applications have been rejected with no reason given by the foreign
affairs police, " AAHRPL spokesman Hsia Hsiao-chuan said. Hsia is
also a professor at Shih Hsin University.</P>
      <P>Most families don't want to apply for extended residence for the
foreign spouses out of fear that they may fight to inherit their late
husband's assets, Hsia claimed.</P>
      <P>A Vietnamese spouse surnamed Pham who attended the press
conference said she doesn't want any money. "I just want to stay in
Taiwan, my home, " she said. Pham was originally granted a one-month
extension by the local police department, but the extension was later
canceled for no apparent reason.</P>
      <P>Chheang Navy, a foreign spouse from Cambodia, said: "Most people
don't realize that new immigrant women, who preferred to be referred
to as such instead of as 'foreign brides, ' are not here for money.
This is our home. This is where we want to be." Navy is working for
the TransAsia Sisters Association (TASA), an organization devoted to
the rights of Southeast Asian women in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Another women, surnamed Le, said her family agreed to apply for
extended residence for her, but the application procedures proved far
too complicated for them to handle. In the end, they were exploited
by an agency and, after waiting for over a year and a paying more
than NT$26,000, the application has still not been approved.</P>
      <P>TASA Secretary-General Shawn Wu cited Article 29 of the
Immigration Act and Article 11 of the Regulations Governing Visiting,
Residence and Permanent Residence of Aliens and said: "According to
Taiwan law, foreign spouses who have lost their husband or who have
children have the right to obtain residence, but local police
departments have sometimes not enforced the law and bowed to pressure
from the local people."</P>
      <P>This is why the AAHRPL has urged the legislature to amend the
Immigration Act as soon as possible, Wu said, adding it is hoped that
the AAHRPL's ideas will be adopted in the amendment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROCESSORS TREATING FISH WITH MONOXIDE TO FACE STEEP FINES: DOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) said Monday
that it will impose steep fines on fish processors who cheat
consumers.</P>
      <P>DOH officials made the remarks after Kaohsiung health officials
found that six out of 19 sashimi samples collected from restaurants
and supermarkets in a random check showed the addition of monoxide to
make them a pinker color.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Tung-ming, acting director of the DOH Department of Food
Safety, noted that monoxide combines with hemoglobin in the blood to
give the fish a fresh reddish-pink luster even if the fish is old or
rotten.</P>
      <P>He said that the addition of monoxide in itself does not post a
health hazard and that at stake is not "food safety" but "a question
of morality, " adding that Japan and the United States place
restrictions on its use.</P>
      <P>He said the DOH will step up its checks on fish processing
factories around the country and that violators will be subject to a
maximum fine of NT$150,000 (US$4,660).</P>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang Legislator Lin Hung-chih convened a
news conference Monday to demand that the DOH regularly check sashimi
to safeguard Taiwan's export-oriented fish.</P>
      <P>Lin also said that he would demand that the DOH formulate a
standard operation of random checks on monoxide in fish so as to
safeguard the health of the Taiwan people and the reputation of
Taiwan's fish exports.</P>
      <P>Addressing Lin's request, DOH specialist Hsieh Ting-hung said
that while there is no scientific basis to suppose that eating food
adulterated with monoxide is a health hazard, it is not a
DOH-approved food additive and violators will be fined and the goods
destroyed.</P>
      <P>In addition, the DOH will work with the Council of Agriculture to
help sashimi operators improve preservation techniques, Hsieh said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou said Monday that he has always advocated maintaining the
status quo in cross-Taiwan Strait relations in accordance with the
stipulations of the National Unification Guidelines.</P>
      <P>In response to criticism that his recent remarks about whether
Taiwan should seek independence or unification show he is "constantly
changing" his views, Ma said he has never deviated from the NUG's
tenets, which define what should be done about cross-strait ties in
the short-, mid- and long-term.</P>
      <P>Part of the criticism has come from a KMT advertisement
explaining his recent remarks in Europe that he claimed have been
taken out of context. Ma urged his critics to "read my full texts."</P>
      <P>A controversy developed around his proposal that independence
could be an option for the people of Taiwan, although the KMT would
not list it as one of its options.</P>
      <P>Under the framework of the Constitution, he said, Taiwan's trade
figures may be changing year by year, but the Republic of China
framework remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>As to how to seek national unification under the Constitution, he
added, the NUG sets a premise of "when conditions are ripe."</P>
      <P>Ma said different parties or countries might have different
definitions of "status quo, " which he said should have the "lowest
common denominator" in President Chen Shui-bian's "five noes"
commitment.</P>
      <P>During his 2000 and 2004 inaugural addresses, Chen pledged that
during his term as president, he will not declare Taiwan
independence, not change the nation's official title, not push for
inclusion of the "state-to-state" description of cross-strait
relations into the Constitution, not hold a referendum on unification
versus independence and not do away with the NUG, which commits the
ROC to eventual unification with China.</P>
      <P>When Chen made that pledge, Ma said, the people applauded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT TO HOLD ACTIVITY IN MEMORY OF 228 INCIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has
prepared two "significant activities" in memory of the victims of the
1947 "228 Incident, " one to be held Feb. 25 at the 228 Peace Park in
downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>This will be the KMT's first ever activity at the park, the KMT's
party history department head Shao Ming-huang said Monday. The park
houses amonument and amemorial hall dedicated to the tragic event,
which broke out Feb. 28, 1947 due to the then-ruling Kuomintang
government's crackdown on untaxed cigarettes, triggering islandwide
disturbances.</P>
      <P>Many thousands of people in Taiwan were killed in the KMT's
infamous "white terror" aftermath. A newly released official report
has concluded that the late President Chiang Kai-shek, who doubled as
KMT chairman, was the culprit who ordered soldiers into Taiwan from
China to execute the brutal crackdown.</P>
      <P>The KMT ruled Taiwan from the end of World World II in 1945 to
2000, when it lost a presidential election to Chen Shui-bian of the
Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>In addition to the planned memorial ceremony at the 228 Park, the
KMT will also screen the premiere of a documentary at party
headquarters Feb. 28, which "honestly" records the event, Shao said.</P>
      <P>Two daughters-in-law of Chang Chi-lang, one of the 228 Incident
victims, will attend the screening at the invitation of KMT Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou. Chang's two sons were also murdered by the KMT.</P>
      <P>Shao said his department has been preparing the memorial
activities since last December, after Ma met with families of 228
victims Oct. 13, 2005 when he promised to do something in memory of
the event.</P>
      <P>The KMT will offer a deep apology for the tragedy and will
continue to carry out "self-reflection," Shao said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20 (CNA)
(By Debby Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu said Monday that the government will work to implement the
policy of "active management, effective opening" proposed by
President Chen Shui-bian to prevent Taiwan's economy from leaning
further toward China, and he hoped that opposition parties will not
dance to the tunes of China.</P>
      <P>Wu also said that China is trying to turn Taiwan into another
Hong Kong and Macao. "To counter the imbalance in cross-strait
relations, Taiwan's best strategy is to make them an international
issue," he added.</P>
      <P>Wu said China is using direct air links, its panda offer and
China's Taiwan Affairs Office Director Chen Yunlin's attempt to come
to Taiwan to bolster its claim that Taiwan is a part of China.</P>
      <P>Wu made the statement during a policy forum on the outlook for
cross-strait relations in 2006 held by the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, a new development with cross-strait relations
this year in Taiwan is the "public and prominent urge for
opposition to Taiwan independence and support for unification with
China."</P>
      <P>Apparently referring to KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, he said that
"an opposition leader" has talked about ultimate unification in recent
interviews and speeches. Wu said the opposition leader has avoided
using the terms set out by the Taiwan government and was apparently
following China's mode of thinking when he said that strengthening
Taiwan's defenses is to engage in a competition in defense.</P>
      <P>Wu further pointed out that another big trend in 2006 is the
number of protests that is growing every year in China. He said the
Chinese government is trying but failing to isolate the protests in
an attempt to prevent them spreading to other areas.</P>
      <P>"Agricultural issues together with grassroots corruption are a
sure guarantee of protests, and they are becoming a ticking time bomb
in China," Wu said.</P>
      <P>He said in future cross-strait relations, the Taiwan government
will work on four aspects: Strive for an increase in the national
defense budget, engage in civil diplomacy and return the title of
"troublemaker" to China; avoid further imbalance in the status quo
and accept the National Security Council's conclusion on how to deal
with the National Unification Council and National Unification
Guidelines to ensure Taiwan's status quo of democracy and freedom to
choose; to urge people in Taiwan to understand that law amendments to
allow for direct air links, acceptance of China's gift of pandas and
Chen Yunlin's attempt to come to Taiwan are all Chinese maneuvers to
make Taiwan a part of China; and to implement the policy of "active
management, effective opening" proposed by President Chen Shui-bian
during his New Year's Day speech to prevent Taiwan's economy leaning
further toward China.</P>
      <P>Wu also reviewed the important cross-strait issues of 2005 and
said the most important matter was the passage of China's
anti-secession law, which marks China's intention to deal with Taiwan
through "non-peaceful means."</P>
      <P>He said China also increased its military deployment, including
missiles and submarines, against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"These are all fast and unilateral acts to change the status quo
in the Taiwan Strait, " Wu said. He said China also suppressed Taiwan
severely in the diplomatic arena.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An 85-year-old Japanese man has committed
suicide by burning charcoal in a Buddhist temple in Taitung, eastern
Taiwan, police said Monday.</P>
      <P>Police identified the man from his passport as Ryohei Yamamoto, a
retired Japanese professor of economics.</P>
      <P>Police found some of the pages in his passport missing, a series
of winning lottery numbers and reports on a controversial monument
commemorating an aboriginal uprising against Japanese colonial rule,
as well as over NT$7,000 (US$217) in his wallet.</P>
      <P>Police said that Yamamoto might have decided to end his life
because of long-term illness according to a short suicide note found
at the scene.</P>
      <P>Hsu Chin-huan, secretary-general of the Lungfeng Buddhist temple
on Liyu Mountain, Taitung, said Yamamoto came to Taitung about a year
ago by himself.</P>
      <P>The two got acquainted at the temple and he arranged for the
retired professor to live in its guest room. Yamamoto would come to
his home to chat with him every day, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Hsu said Yamamoto told him that he first came to Taiwan about
three decades ago, taught economics at National Taiwan University and
published a book on economics.</P>
      <P>He decided to settle in Taitung, Hsu said, adding that he had two

    <HEADLINE>PROBE ORDERED INTO DEATH OF GIRL KILLED BY STRAY POLICE BULLET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan,  Feb.  20 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Tainan city government will begin an
investigation into the death of a teenage girl killed by a stray
bullet fired by a police officer while he was trying to stop a
knife-wielding schizophrenic from attacking him last week.</P>
      <P>Tainan Mayor Hsu Tien-tsai ordered the probe Monday and pledged
that the city government will examine existing mechanisms with regard
to mental patients and find out why a paranoid schizophrenic was able
to roam the streets.</P>
      <P>Chen Hui-fang, 57, was threatening passers-by with a kitchen
knife late last Friday night when two police officers were called in
to overpower him. He went berserk and attacked one of the officers,
injuring his chin, neck, leg and hand.</P>
      <P>According to the police, the two officers fired 24 shots
altogether and pumped at least eight bullets into Chen's abdomen and
legs. One of the shots was fired by the officer being attacked when
he tripped and fell to the ground.</P>
      <P>The stray bullet struck 14-year-old Lin Chia-hua, who was
standing on a sixth-floor balcony about 70 meters away. She was
rushed to hospital, where she died of a chest wound nearly three
hours later early Saturday morning.</P>
      <P>The girl's mother complained that ambulance workers summoned by
the police attended the schizoid man first and ignored her plea for
help, squandering a crucial opportunity to save her daughter's life.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the Bureau of Public Health
under the Tainan city government, there are 1,500 registered mental
patients in Tainan, but Chen's name is not on the list.</P>
      <P>Hsu ordered the relevant authorities to improve control over the
city's mental patients.</P>
      <P>The city government has agreed to pay NT$2.5 million in
compensation to Lin's family, plus NT$300,000 for the girl's funeral
expenses.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the National Police Administration said it will
strengthen police training in use of firearms. The move was
apparently in response to public doubts about the ability of police
officers to protect themselves, in light of the fact that two
officers felt the need to fire 24 shots to overpower a single
knife-wielding man.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said
Monday that a new foreign laborer service center at the Chiang
Kai-shek International Airport has achieved good results after its
launch more than a month ago.</P>
      <P>Officials in charge of foreign laborer operations under the CLA's
Bureau of Employment and Vocational Training said that between Jan.
16 and Jan. 31, the center served more than 5,000 foreign laborers
and handled eight complaints.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the major complaints were alleged
stealing by employers, employers making the foreign laborers to do
more than their approved work, as well as disputes over wages.</P>
      <P>After consultations, two foreign laborers were taken into
shelters, while the six others chose to leave Taiwan, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>They said the CLA will investigate the complaints and reminded
employers that if they make foreign laborers do extra work such as
helping with businesses or house-cleaning at homes other than those
of the employers, the employers will be liable to fines of between
NT$30,000 (US$930) and NT$150,000.</P>
      <P>The service center, set up Jan. 16, is aimed at helping
facilitate the customs clearance of foreign laborers and providing
other necessary information and services, as well as preventing
criminal rings from cheating the new arrivals.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GENERALISSIMO'S GRANDSON THREATENS TO SUE 228 FOUNDATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The late Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's
grandson threatened to sue the 228 Foundation Monday should the
foundation refuse to apologize over what he claims is defamation of
Chiang in a newly published book.</P>
      <P>John Chiang, son of the late President Chiang Ching-kuo and the
generalissimo's grandson, demanded that the 228 Foundation and Chen
Yi-shen, a researcher with Academia Sinica's Institute of Modern
History, apologize for what he claimed is the defamation made in the
book, titled "The 228 Incident: A Report on Responsibility, " which
was published Sunday by the foundation.</P>
      <P>Chiang, currently a legislator of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) , said he will file a lawsuit against the foundation and Chen
and demanded for compensation of NT$5 billion (US$154 million) if the
foundation and the author do not apologize.</P>
      <P>Chiang lashed out at the content of the book, which he claimed is
full of "general writing" and subjective speculation without direct
evidence. "The only precise and clear idea in the book is that Taiwan
should seek independence," Chiang claimed.</P>
      <P>In fact, however, the 590-page book cites declassified official
documents indicating that the KMT should be held responsible for the
228 Incident because the party's leaders at the time of the massacre
-- then President Chiang Kai-shek and then Taiwan Governor Chen Yi --
were its masterminds.</P>
      <P>The book argues that Chiang ordered troops to be dispatched from
China to "maintain order" in Taiwan because protests, which had
spread out from Taipei to other areas of the country, were deemed
"treasonous."</P>
      <P>The book contends that the military crackdown against the
uprising was a criminal act committed by the KMT and that the
government has the right to bring the former ruling party to justice,
even though the statute of limitations is 20 years.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident is named after a rebellion against the KMT's
venal and brutal rule and was sparked Feb. 28, 1947, according to the
book. It has been officially estimated that some 30,000 people were
killed directly by the KMT as a result of the 228 Incident, although
unofficial figures are much higher.</P>
      <P>Chiang claimed that the sponsors and author of the book
"politicized" a historical incident in the name of academic writing.
He further claimed that while the book cited the declassified Tahsi
Documents to make known the fact that "Chiang Kai-shek knew what
was going on from the beginning to the end of the 228 Incident" but he
said that the author intentionally omitted a claim that Chiang
instructed then-Taiwan Governor Chen Yi in a formal note after the
incident that no retaliatory action should be taken against the
Taiwan people or the perpetrators would be dealt with as
criminals.</P>
      <P>The omission is apparently a move to distort and hide the
historical truth, Chiang claimed.</P>
      <P>The private opinion-leader group the Taiwan North Society said
Sunday it was planning to sue the KMT for NT$5 billion in
compensation for damages wrought by the 228 Incident by filing either
a civil or criminal suit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>12 NATIONS TO COMPETE IN ASIAN SQUASH CHAMPIONSHIP IN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 20 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 100 squash players from 12 Asian
countries will compete in the 13th Asian Squash Championship that
opened Monday in Taipei, the Squash Rackets Association of Chinese
Taipei (SRACT) announced at the opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>Squash, a sport most Taiwanese are unfamiliar with, will be an
official event of the 2009 World Games, which is to be held in
the southern Taiwan city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>"The championship will be a warmup game for the 2009 World
Games," President Chen Shui-bian said in his opening remarks.</P>
      <P>Players will compete over eight days for four titles in men's and
women's individual and team competitions at the Taipei Arena's squash
court and the central squash court.</P>
      <P>Leading the way will be Nicol David, dubbed as Malaysia's pride
and currently ranked the world's No.1 in women's squash. David, 23,
is the youngest woman player in history to be No. 1 in the world, and
has won four Asian championships, an Asian Games gold and a silver
medal in the 2002 Commonwealth Games.</P>
      <P>Malaysia features four women's squash players who all rank in the
Top 50 internationally and the highest ranked men's player in the
championship: Ong Beng Hee, who is currently 15th in the world.</P>
      <P>Pakistan men's team, however, is the strongest in the field
and favored to take home the gold. Hong Kong's women's team will
be Malaysia's toughest adversary.</P>
      <P>For host team Taiwan, the championship will be a good learning
experience as Taiwan is relatively new to the game, said Pierre Chen,
President of the SRACT.</P>
      <P>There are about 170 squash courts in Taiwan and people are
picking up an interest in squash. Taiwan didn't establish a squash
association until 1995, although it sent its first squash team abroad
in 1989.</P>
      <P>Countries entering the competition include Hong Kong, Iran,
India, Japan, Kuwait, South Korea, Macau, Malaysia, Pakistan,
Singapore, Sri Lanka and host Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT HEAD NONCHALANT ABOUT SPEAKER WANG'S CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES IDEAS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 20 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that he did not feel any need to amend the
Constitution so the legislature would have 200 seats and the country
would adopt a cabinet system instead of a presidential system, as
Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng has suggested.</P>
      <P>During a Legislative Yuan seminar, Wang called for public debate
on the merits of a German-style Cabinet system, as ruling Democratic
Progressive party (DPP) Legislator You Ching had proposed. Wang also
suggested that the legislature retain 200 seats, instead of the 113
seats slated to go into force with next year's legislative elections.</P>
      <P>"As long as these ideas are good for national development and
good for the parliament, we should support them. We should not shoot
them down simply because they are proposed by the DPP, just as we
should not fire at black shadows as soon as they appear," Wang said.</P>
      <P>He said 113 legislative seats were "absolutely too few" for a
country with a population of almost 23 million. He also urged the KMT
and other opposition lawmakers to make an effort to understand and
evaluate the DPP's proposals, which he said had yet to be finalized.</P>
      <P>To realize Wang's ideas, the Constitution would have to be
amended. Ma said it was important not to get the country embroiled in
another debate on constitutional amendments, but rather to show "a
strong determination" in honoring and implementing the basic law,
without which "new systems still wouldn't be honored and implemented,
anyway."</P>
      <P>Ma said cutting the legislative seats by nearly half was a
measure based on the national consensus built through last May's
Constitutional amendment campaign, a conclusion which had also won
the National Assembly's endorsement.</P>
      <P>"The same procedures would have to be carried out again if the
conclusion were to be changed. Is that worth it? This is a question
we must all reflect upon, " Ma said. "Personally, I don't think it
necessary," he added.</P>
      <P>Too much energy and resources have been wasted over the past 15
years, which has seen the nation's Constitution amended seven times,
he said.</P>
      <P>"It is time for people to rest and get revitalized. It's also
time we implemented the Constitution," he said.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, if the Constitution were to be changed so
soon, the people would "cast strong doubt" on the competency of the
government, including the legislative branch, Ma said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 20 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is developing a program to
further promote the exhibition and conference industry, hoping that
by 2008, 60 international conferences will be held in the country
every year, generating an estimated NT$10 billion (US$308.7 million)
in revenue.</P>
      <P>An economics official told a Council for Economic Planning and
Development meeting Monday that the exhibition and conference
industry -- including airline, hotel, conference, printing and
tourist services -- may have an even greater economic impact than the
tourism industry.</P>
      <P>For example, a tourist spends an average of NT$5,000 per day in
Taiwan, while a conferee spends some NT$20,000 each day, said Tu
Tzu-chun, director of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Commerce
Department.</P>
      <P>He said a total of 34 international conferences were held in
Taiwan in 2004, ranking 34th in the world. As Taiwan is actively
improving its infrastructure and international conferences usually
are not held in the same city every year, there should be great room
for expanding conference and exhibition services in this country, he
noted.</P>
      <P>Under the government's program to boost the industry, efforts are
being made to double the size of the market, assist service providers
in becoming more internationalized, and to develop Taiwan into an
attractive place for staging international conferences and trade
shows, Tu said.</P>
      <P>As the number of conference participants visiting Taiwan has been
increasing at the annual rate of about 10 percent, the government
estimates that by 2008 more than 65,000 people will be visiting
Taiwan for international conferences and exhibitions and spend over
NT$3.9 billion during their stay, according to Tu.</P>
      <P>He said the government has earmarked NT$140 million in a bid to
help achieve that 2008 target.</P>

      <P>Members of a Taiwanese delegation of
lawmakers returning from a trip to India Monday urged business
investors in both countries to cooperate to their mutual advantage in
the IT industry, adding that the Indian government favors offering
attractive corporate tax incentives to Taiwanese investors.</P>
      <P>Secretary-General of the Taiwan-India Inter-Parliamentary Amity
Association, Chuang Suo-hang of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) , said at a news conference that Taiwan's entrepreneurs
need to diversify their investments by targeting India's resources.</P>
      <P>The Chinese market now accounts for about 70 percent of Taiwan's
foreign investment, so it was wiser for Taiwanese investors not to
put all their eggs in one basket, Chuang said.</P>
      <P>India has a better investment climate than China in several
respects, Chuang said, such as low-cost labor, stable financial
policies, a free market, an average annual economic growth of seven
percent, and most of all -- India is a democratic country.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan's computer hardware industry cooperated closely with
India's software design, both countries' IT industry would be assured
of enormous profits in the coming years, Chuang added.</P>
      <P>Chuang Ho-tzu, another member of the delegation to India, said
the Indian government is considering offering Taiwanese investors an
attractive 10-year corporate tax rates, but the details were yet to
be discussed.</P>

industries as other fields where Taiwan's investors could reap

    <HEADLINE>NCC PLANS TO HOLD INAUGURAL MEETING WEDNESDAY</HEADLINE>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The curtain may finally be raised on the
National Communications Commission (NCC) Wednesday, with members
gathering to elect among themselves head and deputy head of the new
organization, government sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>After many twists and turns, Premier Su Tseng-chang finally
appointed last Friday the 12 Legislative Yuan-approved NCC members to
staff the commission, whose establishment has been rocky at best from
the very beginning.</P>
      <P>Immediately after Su gave his endorsement in accordance with the
NCC Organic Law, the NCC's preparatory office staff sent an
appointment notice to each member.</P>
      <P>"Initial contacts show that the NCC members tentatively decided
to meet Wednesday for the first time at the NCC preparatory office, "
a preparatory office spokesman said.</P>
      <P>During their first meeting, the spokesman said, the NCC members
will first attend to briefings by the Government Information Office
and the Directorate General of Telecommunications under the Ministry
of Transportation and Communications on businesses to be transferred
to the NCC's jurisdiction. The preparatory office will also report on
the NCC's future work. The members will then elect among themselves a
new NCC chairperson and deputy chair.</P>
      <P>Three of the NCC members tendered their resignation to the
Executive Yuan before Premier Su had endorsed the roster. Against
this backdrop, there may be only nine members attending the NCC's
inaugural meeting.</P>
      <P>As the NCC's bylaw does not specify how to handle resignations,
Premier Su has not excluded them from the roster. Their resignation
may have to be handled by the soon-to-be-elected NCC chairman.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the NCC has had a rough ride since the bill
concerning its organic law was delivered to the legislature for
ratification last year. Even after the law came into effect Nov. 9
and its 12 members were approved by the legislature in accordance
with the law Jan. 12, the NCC was still not able to begin
functioning.</P>
      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh refused to appoint the NCC
commissioners as soon as the legislature confirmed the list. Then,
his Cabinet asked the Council of Grand Justices (CGJ) Jan. 20 to
interpret the constitutionality of the NCC Organic Law, claiming that
it infringed upon the executive branch's constitutional powers and
thus seriously damaged the constitutional system. The Executive Yuan
also requested that the council impose an injunction suspending the
commission's establishment pending a constitutional ruling.</P>
      <P>Premier Su endorsed the NCC's roster only after opposition
parties threatened to boycott his administrative report Feb. 21, the
opening day of the new legislative session.</P>
      <P>As the opposition "pan-blue" alliance of the Kuomintang and the
People First Party holds a slim majority in the legislature,
"pan-blues"-recommended NCC members outnumber those recommended by
the "pan-green camp" led by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>The 13-member CGJ has begun reviewing the case and is scheduled
to hold a hearing March 8. The Executive Yuan and other relevant
organizations, scholars and experts will be invited to present their
views during the full-day hearing. After the hearing, it may still
take some time before the CGJ metes out its ruling on whether the NCC
is unconstitutional.</P>

(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou approved a new
project Monday that will devote more urban development resources
toward creating more pathways for use by pedestrians and cyclists.</P>
      <P>The plan, submitted by the city government's Department of Urban
Development, will begin with two major streets -- Roosevelt Road and
Chunghsiao East Road -- which enjoy convenient access to the Taipei
mass rapid transit (MRT) underground railway system.</P>
      <P>The number of lanes currently used by motor vehicles will be
reduced in both roads to make room for new bike routes and broader
sidewalks, whose widths may be increased to 12 meters.</P>
      <P>The chief of the Department of Urban Development, Hsu Chih-chien,
said Taipei's future sidewalks would be nearly as wide as the Champs
d'Elysees in Paris, a city known for the beauty of its tree-lined
boulevards.</P>
      <P>Great numbers of trees will be planted along the two
thoroughfares to beautify the landscaping, and eventually the two
streets will be turned into public areas where people can walk, bike,
relax, socialize and play.</P>
      <P>Although the city government's Department of Transportation and
the Public Works Department voiced objection to the plan because car
use in both streets would become less convenient, the mayor threw his
full support behind the plan.</P>
      <P>Ma also instructed the Department of Urban Development to expand
the scope of the plan in the future to include other streets in

Israel Suspends Tax Money Flow to Palestinians 

The Israeli cabinet decided Sunday to
immediately freeze the transfer of about US$50
million a month in tax and customs receipts due
to the Palestinian Authority, arguing that the
swearing in of a Hamas-dominated legislature on
Saturday meant that the Palestinians were now
led by the militant group. Although the cabinet
decided to hold back on other penalties it had
been considering, its move to withhold the
receipts immediately put it at odds with its

Wall Street Journal: Beyond Burgers,
McDonald's Menu Upgrade Boosts Meal Prices and
Results

In early 2003 McDonald's Corp., the world's
largest restaurant chain, had its first-ever
quarterly loss as a public company. Its
customers were defecting to rival chains like
Panera Bread Co., Cosi Inc. and Applebee's
International Inc. The iconic burger giant
responded with a risky departure from its
longtime strategy of targeting children and
young men with inexpensive food. It rolled out
such menu items as the US$4.50 California Cobb
salad with grilled chicken and the US$3.89
grilled chicken club sandwich. While its
customers bit, last year the average check total
increased by 5% to about US$5, a significant
increase in an industry that has long
considered itself highly price-sensitive. Such
increases add up fast when multiplied by the
eight billion customer visits to McDonald's in
the U.S. each year. The new strategy has helped
fuel three years of growth. Revenue increased to
US$20.5 billion in 2005 from $15.4 billion in
2002. Net income grew to US$2.6 billion from
US$893.5 million over that period. Its stock has
bounced back from a low of US$12.12 in March
2003 to US$36.06 yesterday in 4 p.m. composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWANESE, JAPANESE ACADEMICS MEET IN TOKYO TO DISCUSS BILATERAL TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Feb.  20 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The fourth Taiwan-Japan Dialogue forum
opened in Tokyo Monday to discuss the current state of relations
between the two countries and prospects for future development.</P>
      <P>The biennial meeting was jointly organized by two private groups,
Japan's International Forum and Taiwan's International Research
Association. Scores of scholars and experts in the field of
international affairs from both countries attended this year's
meeting.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening ceremony, Koh Se-kai, Taiwan's
representative to Japan, said President Chen Shui-bian's recent
proposals to abolish the National Unification Council, join the
United Nations under the name of Taiwan and write a new constitution
for the country are part of Chen's efforts to maintain the
cross-strait status quo faced with China's mounting military threat
and ever more intensive diplomatic oppression.</P>
      <P>Koh, who concurrently serves as president of Taiwan's
International Research Association, said that if Taiwan failed to
take action to counter China's threat, it may be unable to maintain
the present status quo.</P>
      <P>Many participants from both Taiwan and Japan voiced concern about
communist China's rise as a new economic and military power and the
declining influence of the United States in Asia. They called for the
creation of high-level communication channels for strategic dialogue
between Taiwan and Japan. They also urged Japan to formulate a law
patterned after the United States' Taiwan Relations Act to strengthen
relations and cooperation with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Some Japanese scholars pointed out that closer Taiwan-Japan-U.S.
relations will contribute to Japan's security and stability in East
Asia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>228 FOUNDATION REJECTS LAWMAKER'S APOLOGY REQUEST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 228 Memorial Foundation ruled out
Monday the possibility that it apologizes for a book it released a
day earlier that labeled the late President Chiang Kai-shek as a key
perpetrator in the 228 Incident of 1947 in which thousands of
innocent people were massacred in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yang Chen-lung, the foundation's executive director, made the
response after the late president's grandson, John Chiang, demanded
that the foundation's chairman, Chen Chin-huang, and Chen Yi-shen, a
researcher with Academia Sinica's Institute of Modern History who
authored the book, apologize for branding his grandfather as a chief
culprit of the infamous 228 Incident.</P>
      <P>If Chen Chin-huang and Chen Yi-shen fail to apologize in three
days, John Chiang, a legislator from the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) which ruled Taiwan from 1945 through May 2000, said he will
file a defamation suit against them and ask for NT$5 billion in
damages. John Chiang claimed that the foundation made the accusation
against his grandfather, who also once led the KMT, without providing
direct evidence.</P>
      <P>In response, Yang said John Chiang's request is unacceptable, but
he added that the foundation respects John Chiang's right to file a
lawsuit over the report.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the book, titled "The 228 Incident: A Record on
Responsibility, " is an academic report based on concrete evidence
collected since 1992 from declassified official archives and
documents as well as many other authoritative data, Yang said the
research is mainly aimed at getting to the bottom of the tragic
incident because learning the historical truth can help heal the
wounds of society.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident refers to a series of events in 1947 that led to
a brutal crackdown by the then-KMT government against the local
population, particularly the intelligentsia.</P>
      <P>Yang, himself a descendant of a 228 Incident victim, said one has
to learn from history to avoid repeat of similar tragedy.
"Forgiveness is important, but that does not mean the people should
forget who was actually responsible for the massacre. My earnest hope
is that the main opposition Kuomintang squarely faces up to the truth
and sincerely atones for its past wrongdoings," he added.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident took place in a turbulent period of Taiwan's
history. In 1945, the mainland China-based KMT government reclaimed
Taiwan, which had been a Japanese colony. But the KMT's rule was
brutal and corrupt, leading to a massive protest Feb. 28, 1947, by
the native Taiwanese. More troops were sent from the mainland to
crush the demonstrations and in the following months, soldiers
arrested and killed thousands of people they claimed were communists
or saboteurs trying to overthrow the government.</P>
      <P>Besides accusing Chiang Kai-shek of bearing the main
responsibility of bloody incident, the 590-page book released Sunday
also named three other culprits -- Chen Yi, Ko Yuan-fen and Peng
Meng-chi.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT DELEGATION TO HEAD TO CHINA TO TALK TOURISM OPENING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In a bid to solicit China to allow its
citizens to visit Taiwan for tourism, an opposition Kuomintang
delegation is scheduled to leave for Beijing Tuesday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, executive director of the KMT's Policy
Department and leader of the six-member delegation, said the
delegation will call on Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs
Office under the State Council Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The delegation will also call on officials of the Civil Aviation
Administration of China and the National Tourism Administration,
Tseng said.</P>
      <P>He said that the KMT has played a pivotal role in bringing about
cross-strait charter flights during Chinese New Year holiday in
recent years. Knowing that the public has high expectations of
Beijing allowing all its citizens to visit Taiwan as well as opening
of cross-strait cargo and passenger charter flights, the KMT is
willing to play a bridge-building role again, Tseng said.</P>
      <P>If Beijing allows its citizens to visit Taiwan for tourism, it is
estimated that the tourists will pump about NT$21.1 billion
(US$653.25 million) into the local economy annually in the short term
and NT$84.1 billion annually in the long term, Tseng said.</P>
      <P>However, he added, the public has been let down by the fact that
the private groups designated by the governments on each side of the
Taiwan Strait to engage in the consultations have gotten nowhere so
far.</P>
      <P>The delegation will urge China to unveil substantial measures
in terms of allowing all its citizens to visit Taiwan for tourism
early, as well as try to resolve the key issues surrounding the
cross-strait cargo and passenger charter flights, Tseng said.</P>

ST. BERNARD, Southern Leyte - There is still hope
for the recovery of more survivors in the Friday
landslide that struck this town as more rescue groups
continue to arrive here.

The Philippine Daily Inquirer: Blast rocks
Malacanang

AS PRESIDENT Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo was about to
meet with officials of the Intellectual Property
Office (IPO) for a thanksgiving lunch in Malacanang
yesterday, a loud explosion rocked the Palace grounds.

The Philippine Star: 'There's something down

American and Malaysian officials said yesterday
high-tech seismic-sensitive gear has detected sounds
at the site of an elementary school in Saint Bernard,
Southern Leyte that was buried by a mudslide, raising
hopes on what was mostly a frustrating day for local
and international rescuers.

The Manila Times: We did Palace blast--YOUng

THE anti-GMA Young Officers' Union-new generation

    <HEADLINE>SEEKING ECONOMIC PROSPERITY TOP PRIORITY OF CABINET: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In his first administrative report to the
Legislative Yuan Tuesday, Premier Su Tseng-chang said seeking
economic prosperity will be the top priority of his Cabinet, which
was formed just before the Lunar New Year.</P>
      <P>Su said his Cabinet will pay equal attention to all areas in the
business, industrial, agricultural and fishery sectors, and will
properly deal with issues regarding various infrastructure and
economic development projects, while preparing Taiwan to face the
fast-changing economic situations in the world.</P>
      <P>Su said he has invited Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen to head an
economic and financial task force under the Cabinet aimed at toning
existing economic and financial policies and working out new ones.
Tsai, an academic-turned-lawmaker prior to assuming her current post,
has been known for her specialized knowledge of political, financial
and economic affairs.</P>
      <P>Citing President Chen Shui-bian's "proactive management and
effective opening" directives on cross-Taiwan Strait economic
interactions, Su reiterated that the administration should actively
take up its responsibility as a "manager of risks, " which should not
only seek growth in cross-strait economic exchanges and Taiwan's own
economic advances in a complementary manner, but also ensure that the
various government policies -- which have been crafted with careful
assessment and consideration -- are fully carried out.</P>
      <P>He stressed that when individual interests are found to be in
contradiction with the overall interests of the country, the
administration will not evade its responsibility as a "manager of
risks" and will resolve the contradictions in a pragmatic and
rational manner.</P>
      <P>On the development of cross-strait relations, Su ridiculed
China's claims of its "peaceful rise, " pointing out that it has
deployed hundreds of ballistic missiles aimed at Taiwan. He stressed
that, according to his perception, "peace" is the only thing that
people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait crave for and that
"equality" is what the people of Taiwan demand.</P>
      <P>Su said he wants to tell the Beijing leadership squarely that so
long as China faces courageously the fact of Taiwan's existence as a
sovereign state and accepts Taiwan as a political entity on an equal
footing, he would be pleased to see ceaseless exchanges across the
strait to the benefit of all people on both sides.</P>

      <P>The government's decision to cancel permits
allowing journalists to be stationed at airports is not aimed at
"clamping down on press freedom, " Interior Minister Lee Yi-yang said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lee confirmed news reports that press cards for photographers

thereafter, saying the move is in line with similar measures taken in
the United States, Great Britain, France and Singapore to regulate

      <P>The ban was particularly needed to stop press photographers from
exposing secret trips of foreign political dignitaries to Taiwan or

      <P>Su also called for his fellow compatriots to realize that in
order for Taiwan to achieve sustainable economic development, it must
"plough deep" at home while expanding globally. It would be dangerous
for Taiwan to allow itself to become trade dependent on a single
country, regardless or whether it be the United States, China, Japan
or any other country, he added.</P>
      <P>Speaking about the new year, Su said the administration will
firmly seek to meet several economic targets, including an economic
growth of 4.5 percent or higher, an unemployment rate of less than 4
percent, and a consumer index increase of no more than 2 percent.</P>
      <P>Su stressed that it would be "the shame of the government" if it
were to fail to provide the people with a decent living environment
where everyone has a good job.</P>
      <P>The administration has also resolved to crack down on organized
crime rings to allow the people to live in a society where there is
no "blind spot" in law and order, he continued.</P>
      <P>Su further said that Taiwan currently is not a full-fledged
democracy where the government's public authority is still constantly
challenged. He vowed that in order to safeguard the people's
well-being and ensure steady growth for the country, his
administrative team will be resolute and firm in the future to uphold
the power of public authority.</P>
      <P>Asserting that a great country is one in which the leaders spare
no effort to take care of the less privileged members of society, Su
said his Cabinet will do its utmost to tailor exact measures for the
various groups in society to meet their different needs, he added.</P>
      <P>The premier reiterated that with the public's eager expectations
for peace and prosperity, he hopes the opposition parties in the
Legislative Yuan will be able to cooperate with the Executive Yuan
for the good of the country and its people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DESIGN IS PRIME CONSIDERATION FOR TAIWAN CELL PHONE BUYERS: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 21 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The design and shape of cell phones is the
prime consideration for Taiwan consumers in selecting which to buy,
according to the results of a survey released Tuesday by a local
market research and consulting firm.</P>
      <P>The price is the other major consideration for the consumers, the
survey shows.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by InsightXplorer Limited on 1,494
mobile phone users via online questionnaires Nov. 3-9 last year.</P>
      <P>It shows that the three most popular cell phone brands among the
respondents are Nokia, Motorola and Sony Ericsson, followed by OKWAP
and BenQ. Rounding out the top 10 list were Panasonic, Samsung, PHS,
Sharp and Asus, in that order.</P>
      <P>These 10 brands together enjoy an 80-percent share of Taiwan's
cell phone market, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Among these top-10 brands, cell phones made by Sharp have the
highest average price tag, while those made by BenQ have the lowest.</P>
      <P>The survey indicates that Nokia and Sony Ericsson are attractive
to cell phone buyers because of the functions as well as the shapes
of their products. Motorola and BenQ cell phones, on the other hand,
are popular because of their reasonable prices and basic features.</P>
      <P>Panasonic cell phones' main appeal to consumers is their shapes,
while Sharp phones' major attraction is their advanced features such
as high-definition imaging and videophone, according to the survey.</P>

Reclassifies Many Documents in Secret Review

In a seven-year-old secret program at the
National Archives, intelligence agencies have
been removing from public access thousands of
historical documents that were available for
years, including some already published by the
State Department and others photocopied years
ago by private historians. The restoration of
classified status to more than 55,000 previously
declassified pages began in 1999, when the
Central Intelligence Agency and five other
agencies objected to what they saw as a hasty
release of sensitive information after a 1995
declassification order signed by President Bill
Clinton. It accelerated after the Bush
administration took office and especially after
the 2001 terrorist attacks, according to
archives records. A group of historians,
including representatives of the National
Coalition for History and the Society of
Historians of American Foreign Relations, 
have expressed concern about the
reclassification program, which they believe
has blocked access to some material at the
presidential libraries as well as at the
archives.

    <HEADLINE>MEDIA WORKERS ASKED FOR UNDERSTANDING IN NEW AIRPORT MEASURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 21 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Minister of the Interior Yen Wan-chin
asked Tuesday for understanding on the part of the news media, which
has criticized a government decision to cancel permanent and
provisional press cards held by media workers stationed at Chiang
Kai-shek International Airport as a move to clamp down on press
freedom.</P>
      <P>Yen made the request at a news conference, where he explained how
the decision was made in an interministerial meeting he held Monday
to discuss press activity at airports.</P>
      <P>The meeting was attended by officials of the Ministry of the
Interior, the National Police Administration, the Aviation Police
Bureau, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, the Civil
Aeronautics Administration, the CKS airport administration, the
National Security Bureau and the Government Information Office.</P>
      <P>At the meeting it was concluded that media operations in CKS
airport's controlled areas would require an advance application
starting March 1, and would be administered by the National Police
Administration on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>Yen said that most developed countries use simliar guidelines to
manage the issuance of press cards at airports, and their dedication
to protecting press freedom is no less than that of Taiwan. He added
that the existance of permanent press cards for airport-based media
workers was part of an authoritarian legacy that shouldn't be
preserved.</P>
      <P>At present, a total of 73 such press cards are still held by
journalists for CKS airport, while 20 provisional press cards haven't
been recalled yet. The new measure would only apply to media activity
in the airport's controlled areas, Yen said, noting that one key
criteria in applying for the new press pass is that it must be used
to cover a "public activity."</P>
      <P>In case of an emergency, such as the recent fire caused by sky
lanterns at CKS airport, a special service window will be opened to
accommodate press applications.</P>
      <P>Yen said the new measure had not resulted from any individual
case, nor instructions from a "top authority."</P>
      <P>It is important for the authorities to seek the right balance
between journalistic freedom and airport management, he underscored.</P>
      <P>The rest of Taiwan's airports do not issue permanent press cards.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy is expected to perform
better this year if international oil prices stabilize and the
pressure in the United States to further hike key interest rates
diminishes, President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that for five consecutive months since August last
year, Taiwan's economic indicators have signaled a green light,
showing positive signs of the economy's stable growth.</P>
      <P>With manufacturing production and exports increasing and the
acceleration of government efforts to expand public construction, the
country's economic growth rate is expected to reach 4.83 percent for
the second half of 2005 and stand at 3.8 percent for the year, Chen
said, citing estimates by the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics.</P>
      <P>To boost the real-estate industry, the government has put forth
measures such as low-rate mortgage loans, halving land value
increment tax rates and new urban renewal projects, Chen pointed out.</P>
      <P>He said these measures have shown substantial improvements, with
the housing and construction industry posting a growth rate of 11.4
percent last year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an estimated six in 100 Taiwanese households bought
residences last year, the highest ratio seen in the last seven years,
he added.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks during a meeting with recipients
of the 13th "Golden Stone" awards for architecture.</P>
      <P>Chen said the award's creation has provided the public with an
important reference in selecting building contractors and that he

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT) will seek to
consolidate consensus among opposition and independent parties to
support a "rational and pragmatic" arms procurement plan before the
end of May, a KMT bigwig said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>KMT Policy Committee CEO Tseng Yung-chuan said the KMT will not
change its stance on the long-stalled draft bill governing Taiwan's
procurement of three major weapon systems from the United States
"simply for the purpose of pleasing the Americans."</P>
      <P>Tseng stressed that the KMT has always opposed "cash for
friendship" arms procurement, but will support rational arms
procurement plans and agrees that the KMT should make known its
determination to strengthen Taiwan's self-defense capability.</P>
      <P>Tseng defined "rational and pragmatic" arms procurement plans as
those that can meet the country's defense needs, be supported by the
government's budget and be approved and passed by the legislature.</P>
      <P>As to when the KMT predicts that an arms procurement draft bill
will be passed in the Legislative Yuan, Tseng said the KMT will put
forth its own version of the bill in early March at the latest, and
after that it will consult the opposition People First Party and the
Non-Partisan Solidarity Union to reach a consensus.</P>
      <P>Tseng was positive that lawmakers from the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" will deal with the arms procurement bill during this
legislative session, no later than May.</P>
      <P>The KMT bigwig made the remarks after an activist called
for KMT chief Ma Ying-jeou Tuesday to convey the message of the
Taiwanese people's will opposing further arms procurement on his
forthcoming visit to the United States.</P>
      <P>Kuo Chung-yi, head of the private Anti-Arm Purchasing Alliance,
called for Ma not to compromise on the arms procurement bill simply
to facilitate his visit to the United States in April.</P>
      <P>Kuo urged Ma not to jump through hoops for the Americans, or
become the governor of a 51st U.S. state.</P>

sincerity, wisdom and hard work in order to change people's negative
views of government.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks in response to a question from ruling party
Legislator Cheng Kuo-chung, who asked him what he would do to stop
the Cabinet's support rate from falling, after former premiers Yu
Shyi-kun and Frank Hsieh, whose Cabinets have been called "Combat
Cabinet" and "Symbiosis Cabinet" respectively.</P>
      <P>Su said the public does not hold a positive view of government
because the government hadn't established a good track record.</P>
      <P>"Ever since I assumed the post, I have been demanding real
results from the ruling team, asking politically appointed officials
to keep their personal assets in a trust, and putting integrity and
diligence high on the list of requirements," he said.</P>
      <P>He said he believes his Cabinet will pull off a performance that
will change people's impression of government.</P>
      <P>In response to Cheng's urging the government to stand firm on its
plan to reform the so-called "18-percent interest" for retired

"rationalization program" that reforms the pension system.</P>
      <P>He said the government will explain its policy to the people and
will never back down on implementing reform, adding that he hoped
lawmakers from both ruling and opposition parties would support the
government's pension reform program.</P>
      <P>As to worries that rising oil prices could drive up consumer
prices, Su said his Cabinet is working to make sure that the
composite consumer price index rises less than two percent this year.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan depends on petroleum imports, "it would be impossible
not to raise prices on petroleum products, " but any adjustment would
be reasonable and the government will not just raise oil prices
without lowering them back down again when the conditions are right,

      <P>Ma Ying-jeou, chairman of the main

exercise discretion in considering whether the nation's Constitution
should be amended again to increase the number of seats in the

      <P>Ma pointed out that the Constitution was amended in June last
year -- for the seventh time -- to reduce the number of legislative
seats by half to 113, beginning with the next legislature to be
elected in late 2007.</P>
      <P>He said while the measure has not been implemented yet, some

You Ching had proposed. You suggested that the number of legislative

    <HEADLINE>MND HOPES 3 ITEMS IN ARMS PROCUREMENT PACKAGE WILL CLEAR LEGISLATURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
hopes that all three items of a long-stalled major arms procurement
package will clear the Legislative Yuan intact, Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks after National Defense Minister Lee Jye
called on him at the legislature on the first day of the new session.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, Lee's latest idea is to have all three items
in the package -- eight diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PAC
III anti-missile batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C
submarine-hunting aircraft -- approved so that "the needs of national
defense will be satisfied at one time."</P>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the
People First Party, which together command a slim majority in the
legislature and has blocked the package for nearly two years,
recently said the Patriot PAC III batteries should not be discussed
at all before a three-year referendum ban expires in 2007, since a
2004 referendum on the plan did not meet the validity threshold.
According to the Referendum Act, any plan vetoed in a referendum
cannot be put up for a referendum again for three years.</P>
      <P>Wang reiterated his suggestion to upgrade Patriot PAC II
batteries that are already deployed in Taiwan if the Patriot PAC III
batteries are dropped.</P>
      <P>But the ministry seems more intent on keeping the "original
plan," according to Wang.</P>
      <P>The MND is also prepared to have the budget for the three items
included in regular budget, showing that the ministry is willing to
accommodate to the wishes of the opposition, Wang added.</P>
      <P>The MND also hopes that the ratio of expenditure on national
defense to the gross domestic product will rise gradually from next
year to about 3 percent. Currently, the ratio stands at 2.4 percent
of the GDP.</P>
      <P>On the issue of the submarines, which the opposition lawmakers
have complained are too expensive, Wang said the MND should make
clear its stance, although Lee did not mention the price issue during
the meeting.</P>

(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 30 legislators of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) signed a proposal Tuesday, urging
the DPP leadership to ask former DPP Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung to run
for Taipei mayor in the year-end elections.</P>
      <P>The proposal, which has been presented to the DPP headquarters,
also urged other DPP members interested in running for the mayorship
to declare their candidacy as soon as possible, so that the DPP can
avoid repeating the mistake it made in the last election -- fielding
a nominee too close to the election date.</P>
      <P>The DPP legislators also warned party leaders not to change party
regulations governing how a party primary should be conducted simply
because they want to exclude Shen from the mayoral race.</P>
      <P>News reports a day earlier said that in calculating the
popularity ratings of candidates in the party primary, the DPP might
consider excluding the opinions of respondents who are supporters of
the opposition "pan-blue alliance."</P>
      <P>The contemplated move is seen as targeted specifically at Shen,
who, according to recent poll findings, enjoys high approval ratings
among opposition supporters.</P>
      <P>Shen, who declared his intention to run for Taipei mayor long
ago, said a day earlier upon learning of the DPP legislators'
proposal that he appreciated their support but believed it was too
early to ask the party to call him up as the nominee because the
party can do so only when no-one else is interested in the race.</P>

      <P>Due to delays in the National Palace
Museum's renovation schedule, a major exhibition on the Northern Sung
Dynasty arts will now be pushed back from July to at least the end of
the year, possibly missing out on the museum's 80th anniversary
celebration.</P>
      <P>"Grand View: Painting, Calligraphy and Ju Ware from the Northern
Sung Dynasty and Sung Dynasty Rare Books, " the planned crowning
exhibition for the museum's 80th anniversary, was scheduled to open
as the museum completes its renovation. The original exhibition dates
are from July 15 to October 15. As the renovation is falling behind
schedule, however, the museum decided to also push back the
exhibition.</P>
      <P>"The exhibition will be pushed back to at least the end of the
year because of delays with renovation," head of the museum's public
affairs section Lee Saa-lih said, adding that the delay may cause the
exhibition to miss out the museum's 80th anniversary program. </P>
      <P>The exhibition will feature about 80 paintings and calligraphies,
50 pieces of Ju Ware, and 30 books from the Sung Dynasty. Some of the
pieces will be on loan from museums abroad. The highlights include
the painting Travelers Among Mountains and Streams by Fan Kuan, works
by renowned poet and calligrapher Huang Ting-chien, and all the 21
pieces of Ju Ware the museum owns.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that the renovation is also expected to be
finished at the end of the year, although the exact date is still to
be confirmed. The 2-year long renovations have suffered delays right
from the start as a result of construction and budget issues.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER MAC HEAD ADMITS COINING '1992 CONSENSUS' TERM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  21 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
chairman Su Chi acknowledged Tuesday that he coined the term "1992
consensus" but that he did so in order for Taiwan and China to share
a "basis for dialogue."</P>
      <P>Su, who was MAC chief from 1999 to 2000, said the content of the
"1992 consensus" is "one China, the meaning of which is up to
Taipei's and Beijing's individual interpretation" -- that he claimed
was quoted on many occasions by former President Lee Teng-hui during
his term in office.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks after Lee denounced what he described as "a
monkey kid who tried to fabricate history." Lee, who named Su his
last MAC chief, has long denied that there was any "1992 consensus"
while he was president from 1988 to 2000.</P>
      <P>According to Su, he created the term in March 2000, two months
before then-ruling Kuomintang lost power to the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , purely in order that the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait could have a "basis for dialogue."</P>
      <P>He said that at the time, he realized that the DPP would not
accept "one China, " so he coined a new term that he hoped would be
vague enough to be accepted by Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>Because the DPP government would not even accept that vague term,
which he claimed is an indication that the party does not have any
interest in talking with Beijing, cross-strait relations have been at
a standstill at the official level, Su said.</P>
      <P>He said "one China, whose meaning is up to Taipei's and Beijing's
interpretation" has been quoted by politicians on both sides of the
strait, including Lee, former MAC chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, President
Chen Shui-bian and former deputy director Tang Shubei of Beijing's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"If the term '1992 consensus' cannot be accepted, I will humbly
accept criticism," Su said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OIL PRICES TO AFFECT TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC GROWTH: ECONOMICS OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 21 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With crude oil prices surging sharply after
oil installations in oil-rich Nigeria were attacked by rebel
militants Monday, a senior economics official said Tuesday that oil
prices will be the key factor affecting Taiwan's economic growth this
year.</P>
      <P>However, Thomas M.F. Yeh, vice minister of the Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), noted that the government
will make no new decisions concerning fuel-price adjustments in the
near future, as long as international oil prices are maintained at
the current level.</P>
      <P>A foreign wire report said Tuesday that light, sweet crude for
March delivery rose US$1.57 to US$61.29 a barrel in Asian electronic
trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) mid-morning in
Singapore. Nymex trading was closed Monday for Presidents Day
holiday.</P>
      <P>Yeh said many uncertain factors could affect economic growth,
with many of them related to changes in oil prices. He cited a local
fuel-price hike last week and the fact that the hike has led
Taiwan-based airline companies to ask for an increase in fuel
surcharges.</P>
      <P>The CEPD is examining the possible impact of escalating political
tensions in Nigeria on the global oil market in the future, but it
isn't too concerned, Yeh said, because crude oil production of the
leading oil exporter in Africa makes up only a small share of the
world's entire output.</P>
      <P>He recommended the government refrain from making frequent
adjustments in fuel-product prices or other commodities for the sake
of social stability.</P>
      <P>Nigeria usually produces about 2 million barrels of crude oil a
day.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) is
willing to remove Patriot PAC III missiles from a controversial
weapons package from the United States "out of respect" for the
opposition parties, National Defense Minister Lee Jye said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lee was reflecting the attitude of the military on the arms
purchase package while answering questions from legislators on behalf
of Premier Su Tseng-chang at an interpellation session in the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>As for two other items -- eight diesel-electric submarines and 12
P-3C anti-submarine aircraft -- in the procurement plan, Lee said the
MND favors having them included in a regular fiscal budget instead of
a special budget.</P>
      <P>The premier urged the legislature to support the military
procurement plan and pass related legislation as soon as possible to
appropriate the needed funds, be it in the form of a regular budget
or a special budget.</P>
      <P>In the past two years, the opposition-controlled legislature has
blocked two bills submitted by the Democratic Progressive Party-led
government that would ask for a special budget of NT$480 billion to
buy the submarines, submarine hunting aircraft and six Patriot PAC
III anti-missile batteries from the United States.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucuses of the two major opposition parties --
the Kuomintang and the People First Party -- have argued that a 2004
referendum vetoed the proposed purchase of the missile batteries,
which would cost NT$140 billion.</P>
      <P>One of the two questions asked in the referendum held at the same
time as the last presidential election was: "Should China refuse to
withdraw the missiles it has targeted at Taiwan and to openly
renounce the use of force against us, would you agree that the
government should acquire more advanced anti-missile weapons to
strengthen Taiwan's self-defense capabilities?"</P>
      <P>The referendum proposal was defeated because less than 50 percent
of eligible voters cast their ballots.</P>
      <P>Opposition legislators have pointed out that according to law,
the issue of buying the Patriot PAC III batteries should not raised

    <HEADLINE>NT$6 BILLION TO BE SPENT ON BROADBAND CONDUITS IN INDUSTRIAL ZONES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  21 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs has set
aside NT$6 billion (US$184.72 million) to build conduits for
broadband Internet access in the island's 60 industrial parks,
according to Tuesday's Commercial Times.</P>
      <P>The paper quoted officials from the Industrial Development Bureau
under the ministry as saying that the project, which is a part of a
NT$30 billion program to build broadband conduits around the country,
will start at the ministry's Taichung Industrial Park in central
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Once the conduits are in place, the officials said, private fixed
line phone service providers can apply to lay their own fiberoptic
networks in the industrial parks, providing access to the Internet
that could create a market worth NT$2.16 billion per year.</P>
      <P>In light of the fact that Taiwan's flat panel manufacturers are
engaged in fierce competition with their South Korean counterparts on
the global market, the officials said Taiwan's competitiveness is
compromised because of its lower broadband penetration rate -- 41
percent at present compared to South Korea's 63 percent.</P>
      <P>Taiwan cannot even match Hong Kong, which boasts a broadband
penetration rate of 55.9 percent, or Singapore, which boosts a rate
of 45.7 percent, the officials said.</P>
      <P>By facilitating the installation of broadband networks, the
officials said, the government hopes local manufacturers'
competitiveness will be boosted because broadband will help them
transmit information faster and more efficiently.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN URGED NOT TO CHANGE CROSS-STRAIT STATUS QUO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  21 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Urging Taiwan to refrain from taking
unilateral steps to change the cross-Taiwan Strait status quo has
been the main focus of the United States' recent communication with
Taiwan on the country's plan to abolish an organization and policy
guidelines symbolic of its objective to unify with China, a U.S.
State Department official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"In all of our discussions, we've reiterated the view that Taiwan
needs to refrain from taking actions which can be seen as unilateral
efforts to change the status quo, that they need to move to address
the issues they have with respect to China through dialogue, and
that's our consistent message in our dealings with the Taiwanese, "
said J. Adam Ereli, deputy spokesman of the department, during a
regular news briefing.</P>
      <P>Asked what kind of message Washington is getting from Taiwan on
President Chen Shui-bian's idea to scrap the National Unification
Council and National Unification Guidelines, Ereli said "I'm not
going to speak for the officials in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>He declined to comment on whether Washington will take any
punitive measures against Taiwan if Chen decides to go ahead with the
plan, on the grounds that the question is "hypothetical."</P>
      <P>On reports that Dennis Wilder, an official in charge of Asian
affairs at the National Security Council (NSC) under the White House,
went to Taiwan last week to try to persuade Chen to drop the plan,
Ereli said he is not aware of the visit.</P>
      <P>"I'd refer you to the White House for the NSC to comment on
travels by its officials," he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan media reports cited anonymous Washington sources as saying
that Wilder visited Taiwan last week in the company of ROC
Representative to the United States David Ta-wei Lee in a bid to talk
Chen out of going ahead with the plan.</P>
      <P>During his meeting with Chen, Wilder conveyed Washington's grave
concern over the plan and urged Chen to honor his promise of not
abolishing the National Unification Council and National Unification
Guidelines, according to the reports. But Chen reportedly has no
intention of changing his mind.</P>
      <P>Over the past few weeks, government officials in Taiwan have
called public attention to the fact that the promise was built on the
prerequisite that "China has no intention of using force against
Taiwan," which they claim no longer exists given Beijing's increasing
missile deployment targeting Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT BIGWIG MEETS WITH BEIJING OFFICIAL IN CHARGE OF TAIWAN AFFAIRS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  Feb.  22 (CNA)
(By M.K. Chang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A bigwig from Taiwan's main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) met with China's top official in charge of Taiwan
Affairs in Beijing Wednesday for talks on a wide range of topics,
including the prospects of China allowing its citizens to visit
Taiwan for tourism.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, executive director of the KMT's Policy
Department and leader of a six-member KMT delegation, met with Chen
Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under Beijing's State
Council, at the Diaoyutai Guest House to talk about allowing Chinese
tourists to visit Taiwan, opening direct cross-Taiwan Strait cargo
and passenger charter flight services, and other matters concerning
the well-being of the people across the strait.</P>
      <P>Tseng and Chen are expected to brief the media about the meeting
later in the day.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the beginning of the meeting, Chen said he had mixed
feelings watching Taiwan businessmen and their dependents return to
Taiwan for home-coming visits by boarding direct charter flights
prior to the Lunar New Year about opening direct cross-strait charter
flight service for the holiday period.</P>
      <P>Chen said he keenly hopes special direct cross-strait charter
flights can also be operated during other holidays to make travel
more convenient for China-based Taiwan nationals.</P>
      <P>For his part, Tseng said that although the issues regarding
allowing Chinese citizens to visit Taiwan for tourism and opening
direct cross-strait charter flight services have been discussed by
representatives from the private sector on the two sides of the
strait, the question of whether they will be implemented remains up
in the air.</P>
      <P>Tseng said the KMT has high expectations about the delegation's
visit to Beijing and hopes that it will help make the plans a
reality.</P>
      <P>Tseng said that the KMT has played a pivotal role in bringing
about cross-strait charter flights during the Chinese New Year
holiday period in recent years. Aware that the Taiwan public has high
expectations concerning Beijing allowing all its citizens to visit
Taiwan for tourism as well as concerning the opening of cross-strait
cargo and passenger charter flights, he said the KMT is willing to
play a bridge-building role again.</P>
      <P>If Beijing allows its citizens to visit Taiwan for tourism, it is
estimated that the tourists will pump about NT$21.1 billion
(US$653.25 million) into the local economy annually in the short term
and NT$84.1 billion annually in the long term, he added.</P>
      <P>The KMT delegation -- which also includes KMT Legislator Chu
Feng-chih, KMT Mainland Affairs Department director Chang Jung-kung,
and Chen Shih-yi, a former vice minister of transportation and
communications -- is expected to pay visits to the Civil Aviation
Administration of China and the National Tourism Administration
during its two-day stay in Beijing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NATIONAL UNIFICATION COUNCIL SHOULD BE FORMALLY ABOLISHED: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday
that the National Unification Council (NUC) should be formally
abolished, calling the organization an "absurd product of an absurd
era."</P>
      <P>The president noted that the NUC, set up by the former Kuomintang
(KMT) administration in 1990 with the aim of eventual unification
with China, has violated the democratic principle of sovereignty
which lies with the people and stripped the right of the Taiwan
people to have the final say in the direction of cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while receiving U.S. Congressman Robert R.
Simmons at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The president said that there were many factors involved in his
proposal Jan. 29 to seriously consider scrapping the NUC and its
policy guidelines.</P>
      <P>The factors are related to "democracy and national security, " he
continued.</P>
      <P>Since the KMT has made adjustments in its policy by stating that
Taiwan independence is a possible option of Taiwan people, the NUC
and its guidelines "naturally should be formally abolished" because
the NUC, with unification with China as its ultimate goal, has ruled
out the possibility of Taiwan independence as an option, the
president said.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said recently that Taiwan independence
may be an option of some people in Taiwan but is by no means an
option of the KMT.</P>
      <P>The president said that Taiwan must strengthen its national
defense lest its national sovereignty be "distorted or denigrated."</P>
      <P>Strengthening national defense is to maintain the status quo in
the Taiwan Strait and is a way to avoid the status quo in the Taiwan
Strait from being unilaterally changed by force, Chen said.</P>
      <P>"If unification is the only and ultimate option, it is no wonder
that some say there is no need to strengthen national defense or
increase arms procurement," he added.</P>
      <P>He was indirectly referring to the long-stalled arms procurement
package in the Legislative Yuan. The opposition-controlled
legislature has blocked the planned procurement of eight
diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PAC III anti-missile
batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C submarine-hunting aircraft for
nearly two years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'92 CONSENSUS' A BAREFACED KMT-CPC LIE: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday
that the so-called "92 consensus" regarding the "one China" principle
is nothing but a "barefaced lie" crafted by a former Kuomintang (KMT)
official and a slogan used by the KMT and the Communist Party of
China (CPC) to cheat the world for years.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the KMT and the CPC have used the "92 consensus"
term -- invented by former Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Su
Chi in 2000 -- to fool the world, including the United States, for at
least six years in arguments over the development of cross-Taiwan
Strait relations.</P>
      <P>The president stressed that no consensus was reached during the
talks between officials from Taiwan and China held in Hong Kong in
1992.</P>
      <P>Su made up the "92 consensus" term in April 2000 in order to
break the cross-strait deadlock and lessen tensions, Chen quoted Su
as admitting the day before.</P>
      <P>The then ruling KMT began to use the term "92 consensus" in 2000,
expressing that the term referred to the consensus that "each side
(of the strait) could interpret the 'one-China' principle in its own
way, " while the CPC began to use the term in August 2000 to claim
that both sides insisted that "there is only one China in the world,"
Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president said that he has been persistently urged over the
past several years by the opposition, the Beijing leadership and even
Washington to accept the "92 consensus" even though he has repeatedly
said that there was no consensus reached at the Hong Kong talks.</P>
      <P>Now, the term's "inventor" -- Su Chi, currently a KMT legislator
-- has admitted that he made up the term when he was the MAC chairman
"in a bid to encourage observers to think that each side has its own
interpretation of the meaning of 'one China,'" the president said.</P>
      <P>Su admitted that then President Lee Teng-hui was not in the know
when the term was invented. Lee found out about it later from the
newspapers, but he never mentioned later that it was improper, Su
said.</P>
      <P>Su made the admission Tuesday in response to Lee's comments at a
Taiwan Solidarity Union seminar held Monday that the so-called "1992
consensus" was a fiction. "Little monkey boy's trying to make up
history," Lee said of Su, daring him to respond on the matter.</P>
      <P>Chen further said that after he assumed the presidency in May
2000, he could not find any record about the "92 consensus" term even
after "having turned over every stone."</P>
      <P>Chen said he also asked then chairman of the intermediary Straits
Exchange Foundation, C.F. Koo, about the authenticity of the "92
consensus," and was told by Koo that "there was no such thing."</P>
      <P>The president asserted that KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou was lying
to himself and to the world when he stressed during his recent visit
in Britain that the KMT would seek to talk with China based on the
"92 consensus," "because the '92 consensus' doesn't exist."</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with U.S. Congressman Robert
R. Simmons at the Presidential Office Wednesday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT REAFFIRMS ARMS PROCUREMENT PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  22  (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed
Wednesday that the government has not changed its policy toward the
long-stalled arms procurement package from the United States nor has
it any intention of giving up any of the three items covered in the
package.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that all three items were requested by Taiwan
before he assumed the presidency in 2000, with the request for
submarines issued by the former Kuomintang (KMT) government in 1994,
for submarine-hunting aircraft in 1997 and for Patriot PAC-III
anti-missile batteries in 1998.</P>
      <P>Chen said national security is in the common interests of both
the ruling and opposition parties and that the policy should not be
affected by a transition of power.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan maintains friendly and close relations with the
United States and that the two countries are "the best" democratic
allies and security partners.</P>
      <P>"It is the greatest responsibility of the government and people
of Taiwan to strengthen and enhance the country's ability to defend
itself to prevent the cross-Taiwan Strait military balance from
tilting in favor of China, which will jeopardize peace, security and
stability in the Asia-Pacific region," he said.</P>
      <P>"We are resolved, determined and fully prepared to achieve the
goal of increasing the country's defense spending to 3 percent of
gross domestic product by 2008," he added.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks during a meeting with Robert R.
Simmons, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, who is
visiting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and People First
Party, which controls a slim majority in the legislature, has blocked
the package for nearly two years, because of disagreement with the
Cabinet over the budgeting method and the cost of the procurement.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" has also argued that the Patriot PAC-III
anti-missile batteries, which they claim failed to win the support of
the people in a 2004 referendum, should not be discussed at all
within three years of the referendum being held.</P>
      <P>A referendum held alongside the presidential election on March
20, 2004 on whether to purchase more anti-missile armaments was
declared invalid because less than half of the eligible voters took
part in the poll. According to the country's referendum law, no
referendum can be held on the same issue within three years of it
being voted on.</P>
      <P>In what was the latest compromise to the opposition, Minister of
National Defense Lee Jye said Tuesday that his ministry is prepared
to finance the three items from its regular annual budget, instead of
with a special budget to which the opposition objects.</P>
      <P>The ministry also hopes to increase the country's defense
spending to 2.85 percent of the GDP by 2007 and further to 3 percent
of GDP by 2008, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>He said the supplementary budget to be put forth by the ministry
for this year will only include the submarines and aircraft.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT ALLEGATION ON TAIWAN-U.S. TIES `SENSATIONAL': DPP CAUCUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Communications between Taiwan and the
United States are smooth and the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) should
not make "sensational allegations, " a caucus whip of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Chen Jin-chun also said the KMT should not side
with China and the United States to act against Taiwan and dismiss
the government's efforts to safeguard national security.</P>
      <P>Chen was responding to criticism by KMT legislators in the wake
of news reports that the U.S. sent Dennis Wilder -- an official in
charge of Asian affairs at the National Security Council under the
White House -- to Taiwan last week to dissuade President Chen from
pushing what the report described as "his plan" to scrap the National
Unification Council (NUC) and the National Unification Guidelines.</P>
      <P>The legislator said that when Chen pushed for the first national
referendum in 2004, he also encountered enormous pressure from
Washington, but as a democratic country, the U.S. should have
understood and accepted the will of the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Bi-khim, a DPP legislator and director of the DPP's
International Affairs Department, said that there are no indications
of any changes in Taiwan-U.S. relations.</P>
      <P>Saying that Taiwan and the United States share the view that the
status quo in the Taiwan Strait should remain unchanged, she added
that "Taiwan can understand that the U.S. does not want either side
of the Taiwan Strait changing the status quo unilaterally, but Taiwan
also does not want the status quo being changed by China."</P>
      <P>She said that while "there might be differences in perception
between Taiwan and the U.S., the gap is not as big as reports
suggest, " adding that the friendship between Taiwan and the U.S. is
based on myriad exchanges and can withstand any tests.</P>
      <P>Pan Wei-kang, a KMT legislator and caucus whip in the
legislature, questioned the president's proposal that it might be
time to start thinking about the possibility of scrapping the NUC,
asking if it is "in line with public aspirations or just his own
whim."</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lee Ching-an said the president has ignored
Republic of China representative to the U.S. David Ta-wei Lee's
warning that communications between Taiwan and the U.S. have been
useless since the idea was proposed Jan. 29, speculating that the
U.S. envoy came to 'send an ultimatum to Taiwan.'</P>
      <P>Although Chen has never convened a meeting of the NUC -- an
organization set up by the former KMT administration -- it carries
the symbolic significance that the island will not move toward de
jure independence, which Beijing has threatened to stop by force.</P>
      <P>The U.S. is concerned whether Chen's next move will be to promote
a referendum on a new constitution and overturn his "five noes"
pledges, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Chen promised his "five noes" -- no declaration of independence,
no change of the formal name of the nation, no referendum to change
the cross-strait status quo, no inclusion of "special state-to-state
cross-strait ties" in the Constitution and no scrapping of the NUC
and its policy guidelines if China has no intention of using force
against Taiwan -- during his inaugural speeches of 2000 and 2004.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ACTIVISTS CALL FOR USING DEFENSE SPENDING MONEY FOR EDUCATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of academics and social activists
called for politicians of all stripes Wednesday to make savings on
defense spending to ensure that budgets for education and other
social benefit plans are not crowded out.</P>
      <P>At a press conference, professors Huang Kuang-kuo and Chang
Ya-chung of National Taiwan University, and Professor Hsieh Ta-ning
of National Chung Cheng University -- all of whom are members of the
private Democratic Action Alliance -- said that both the ruling and
opposition parties have agreed to increase the annual budget for
national defense to 3 percent of the country's gross domestic product
(GDP) from the current 2 percent.</P>
      <P>If a new defense budget plan -- at 3 percent of the GDP -- is
realized and listed as part of the government's annual budget, it
will inevitably eat into other budgets in other "more critical"
areas, including education and social welfare, given that the
country's finances are increasingly strained, according to Huang.</P>
      <P>Huang, Chang and Hsieh criticized the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
and the People First Party (PFP) for supporting increasing the
defense budget, claiming that their moves are tantamount to helping
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) out of its current
predicament.</P>
      <P>Huang said that although the government's education budget has
been increased from year to year, it has decreased in terms of
proportion in that the ratio of education budget to gross national
product (GNP) and GDP has declined.</P>
      <P>Noting that the defense budget at present is around 2 percent of
the GDP, Huang claimed that should it be scaled up to 3 percent --
equivalent to some NT$60 billion annually -- it will eat away at the
budgets for education, social welfare and other important areas.</P>
      <P>Huang called for KMT and PFP lawmakers to hear the voices of
educational groups and social groups opposed to expanding military
spending prior to putting forth their respective versions of arms
procurement projects that he claimed will be no different from that
of the DPP government and are all "cash for friendship" plans.</P>

regulations passed by the Executive Yuan earlier this month,
Government Information Office Minister Cheng Wen-tsang said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Cheng made the remarks one day after the deadline passed for
political appointees not posted overseas to place their assets into
trust.</P>
      <P>He noted that the majority of political appointees have
followed the requirement and that both Premier Su Tseng-chang and
Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen have placed their assets in the trust of
managers of the Hwa Nan Commercial Bank.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that out of 105 political appointees not posted
overseas, 80 have completed the legal procedures to put their
assets into trust, while 21 have not because their assets, including
property investments and securities, do not meet the requirements for
being put into trust.</P>
      <P>But four political appointees -- Vice Foreign Affairs Minister
Michael Ying-mao Kau, National Palace Museum Vice Curator Lin
Po-ting, Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Vice Chairman Cheng
Tung-hsing and State Public Prosecutor-General Wu Ying-chao -- have
not completed the procedure, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>He explained that Kau's assets are in the United States, where
the procedure for placing assets into trust is more complicated,
while Lin is preoccupied with his businesses, Su was overseas between
Feb. 15 and Feb. 21, and Wu has already tendered his resignation and
will remain at his post only until the naming of his replacement by
President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>With an aim of building a clean government, the Executive Yuan
passed the package of regulations earlier this month, requiring 132
political appointees to put their assets into trust.</P>
      <P>Twenty-seven ROC ambassadors and representatives overseas must do
so by April 24.</P>
      <P>The political appointees can instruct their trust managers to
dispose of the assets, although they will have to notify the ethics
department of the Executive Yuan on any transactions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-U.S. COMMON GROUND LARGER THAN GAP: FOREIGN MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan-U.S. common ground that the
cross-Taiwan Strait status quo should be maintained is larger than
other differences existing between the two sides, Minister of Foreign
Affairs Huang Chih-fang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Huang said the government continues to communicate smoothly with
the United States on President Chen Shui-bian's proposal to consider
abolishing the National Unification Council and National Unification
Guidelines, but he would not disclose details of the communication.</P>
      <P>Huang was responding to local media reports that Dennis Wilder,
an official in charge of Asian affairs at the National Security
Council under the White House, visited Taiwan last week to try to
persuade Chen to drop the idea and that the discussions came to a
stalemate because Chen showed no intention of changing his mind.</P>
      <P>Dismissing the reports as exaggerated and sensational, Huang said
communication between the two sides remains good.</P>
      <P>He would not confirm if Wilder visited Taiwan, claiming that it
would violate diplomatic practice to make public details concerning
the communication between the two countries.</P>
      <P>He urged the media to stop speculating on the issue, pointing out
that Chen has only instructed the National Security Council to study
the feasibility of scrapping the National Unification Council and
National Unification Guidelines and that a conclusion has not been
reached.</P>
      <P>Huang said the government has repeatedly stressed that it has no
intention of changing the cross-strait status quo and has also
reiterated this point in the course of its communication with
Washington.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, there are many areas of common ground between
Taiwan and the United States, the most important of which is their
mutual desire that the cross-strait status quo is maintained.</P>
      <P>In Washington, U.S. State Department Deputy Spokesman J. Adam
Ereli said Tuesday that in its recent communication with Taipei,
Washington has reiterated its view that Taiwan needs to refrain from
taking actions that could be seen as unilateral efforts to change the
status quo.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CANNOT DENY EXISTENCE OF 1992 CONSENSUS: KMT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou said Wednesday that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) may disagree with the content of the so-called "1992
consensus," but it cannot deny that such a consensus did exist.</P>
      <P>Without that consensus, reached by negotiators from Taipei and
Beijing in Hong Kong in 1992, their top negotiators, Koo Chen-fu and
Wang Daohan, respectively, would not have met the following year in
Singapore and reached a four-point agreement, said Ma. The Koo-Wang
talks resulted in the establishment of a mechanism for regular talks,
which was later aborted.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks after a KMT Central Standing Committee
meeting, in response to an allegation by President Chen Shui-bian
that the KMT and the Communist Party of China lied to the world and
duped the United States, as the consensus has never existed.</P>
      <P>Then-Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Su Chi, now a KMT
legislator, said Tuesday that he coined the term "1992 consensus" to
refer to the idea of "one China, whose meaning is up to Taipei's and
Beijing's individual interpretations."</P>
      <P>Ma said that as a deputy chairman of the MAC at the time, he
could also testify to the existence of the consensus.</P>
      <P>Su said he created what he described as the "vague term" in March
2000 in the hope that both sides of the Taiwan Strait could retain a
"basis for dialogue" if they could show a bit flexibility, but the
DPP government, which came into power in May of that year, would not
accept the term, an indication, he claimed, that the DPP showed
itself uninterested in talking with Beijing, bringing cross-strait
relations to a standstill at the official level.</P>
      <P>As the DPP's intention to pursue Taiwan independence has become
more and more evident since President Chen Shui-bian unveiled his
proposal that it might be time to begin thinking about doing away
with the National Unification Council and Guidelines, Ma got himself
into trouble by declaring that independence could be an option for
the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On this controversy, Ma said some people in Taiwan support the
idea of Taiwan independence and since it is their constitutionally
protected freedom of speech to advocate the idea, the KMT cannot
deprive them of that right.</P>
      <P>As for the KMT itself, he stated that it has never listed
independence as an option. "The KMT did not, does not and will not
put Taiwan independence on the party platform. We have been very
consistent on this matter," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>He explained that Taiwan should choose status quo instead of
independence, because only by so doing will it be able to keep its
democratic and economic achievements from being destroyed.</P>
      <P>Maintaining the status quo across the Taiwan Strait is also the
policy of the U.S. and Japan, Ma said, adding that China will not
dare to invade Taiwan because it chooses to maintain the status quo.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, "status quo is the best option for
safeguarding Taiwan's security. This is the KMT's option, but we will
not deprive other people in Taiwan of their right to propose
independence."</P>

    <HEADLINE>POOR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION SHOULD NOT BE COMPROMISED: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Education for children from poor families
should not be compromised because of the design of administrative
systems, Premier Su Tseng-chang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Su said he came from a poor family and knows very well the plight
of disadvantaged people because of "economic and area barriers, "
adding that it is the government's duty to craft effective policies
and measures to allow children from less privileged families or
geographically remote areas access to better education to help them
secure the strength to compete.</P>
      <P>He added that improving education for children from disadvantaged
groups is the responsibility of his administration.</P>
      <P>The premier recalled that his mother, a school teacher, rode her
old motorbike to an elementary school in Pingtung, southern Taiwan
every morning with her students' notebooks fastened to the back seat
and three lunch boxes hung under the bike's rearview mirror.</P>
      <P>When Su asked his mother why there were three lunch boxes, she
said many children from rural areas had no lunch boxes because their
mothers could not face poverty and had fled the countryside, and that
she regularly had such kids in her class.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, officials from the Ministry of Education said that the
budget to beef up education for children in remote areas or from
disadvantaged groups has been gradually increased on a yearly basis
-- from some NT$3.3 billion in 1999 to NT$12.5 billion in 2006.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The situation across the Taiwan Strait
remains normal and stable and a management change in this year's Han
Kuang military exercises has nothing to do with the cross- situation,
a senior Ministry of National Defense (MND) official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Liao Tieh-ming, an MND deputy minister in charge of army affairs,
made the remarks in response to questions from main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker Lu Shiow-yen earlier that day at a news
conference, who claimed that President Chen Shui-bian's recent
remarks about scrapping the National Unification Council (NUC) and
its guidelines have stirred up cross-strait tension and dragged in
the United States, forcing the MND to upgrade the scale of the Han
Kuang military drills this summer.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that no special military deployment on the other
side of the strait has been detected, Liao denied Lu's accusation and
said that the armed forces have set up a mechanism to cope with any
contingencies arising from across the strait.</P>
      <P>Liao also denied that the MND will upgrade the scale of the
annual Han Kuang military drills this summer, stressing that the
decision to have Defense Minister Lee Jye serve as the top
"arbitrator" in the upcoming Han Kuang computerized war games is
mainly a measure in line with two revised defense laws.</P>
      <P>In the past, the chief of the General Staff served as the top
"arbitrator" in the Han Kuang computerized war games. This year, the
defense minister will take over the role for the first time in
accordance with the revised defense laws.</P>
      <P>"The new arrangement is more pragmatic, as the two revised
defense laws require integration of military command and
administrative affairs, " Liao said.</P>
      <P>Liao added that the cross-strait situation remains normal and
that there is no unusual tension or change as claimed by opposition
lawmakers.</P>
      <P>As to their concern that Chen's plan to scrap the NUC could spark
a cross-strait conflict, Liao said that the military has long had a
mechanism in place to avoid triggering a cross-strait war
unwittingly.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND TO RESUBMIT REQUEST TO PURCHASE PATRIOT BATTERIES IN 2007</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>National Defense Minister Lee Jye said
Wednesday that the Defense Ministry's plan to purchase Patriot PAC
III anti-missile batteries as part of a major arms procurement
package from the United States will be resubmitted to the Legislative
Yuan next March.</P>
      <P>Lee said the matter can be discussed after a ban on such
discussion expires next March, referring to the failed result of a
referendum held in tandem with the 2004 presidential election. The
referendum law stipulates that an issue cannot be put to referendum
within three years of a previous one.</P>
      <P>The question asked March 20, 2004 was: "Should China refuse to
withdraw the missiles it has targeted at Taiwan and to openly
renounce the use of force against us, would you agree that the
government should acquire more advanced anti-missile weapons to
strengthen Taiwan's self-defense capabilities? " The result was
considered invalid because less than 50 percent of eligible voters
cast their ballots.</P>
      <P>Lee told Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng the previous day that
he still hopes all three items in the arms procurement deal will be
passed by the legislature "to satisfy the country's defense needs at
one time, " and that the funds to finance the three items be listed
under a regular budget instead of a special budget.</P>
      <P>But to "respect the wishes of the opposition parties, " the
ministry will drop the Patriot PAC III missile batteries from the
shopping list, Lee said.
</P>
      <P>In the past two years, the opposition-controlled legislature has
blocked two bills submitted by the Democratic Progressive Party-led
government asking for a special budget of NT$480 billion to buy eight
diesel-electric submarines, a squadron of 12 P-3C submarine-hunting
aircraft and six Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries from the
United States.</P>
      <P>Lee told Wang that the arms procurement package cannot be stalled
any longer and solicited his assistance in letting the two other items
of the arms procurement project clear this legislative session early.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT WARNS AGAINST SCRAPPING NUC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 22 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) urged
President Chen Shui-bian Wednesday not to scrap the National
Unification Council (NUC) -- one of the "five noes" guarantees that
he made in his 2000 and 2004 inaugural speeches -- to safeguard
Taiwan's peace.</P>
      <P>KMT spokeswoman Cheng Lee-wen issued the call after Chen claimed
earlier the same day that it is right to abolish the nominal body and
its guidelines now that KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou has also listed
independence as a possible option for the Taiwan people regarding the
country's future.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the NUC, which sets the stage for Taiwan's
unification with China, is an anachronism established by the previous
KMT government during a "different time." Chen also claimed that the
"1992 consensus" -- an ambiguous verbal agreement the KMT claims was
reached by officials from Taiwan and China that same year in Hong
Kong regarding cross-Taiwan Strait relations -- does not exist.</P>
      <P>The KMT spokeswoman called on Chen not to distract public
attention by rehashing the NUC issue and warned that the "five noes"
policy is one of the criterion that maintains the cross-strait status
quo. "Chen's remarks about abolishing the NUC are unnecessary and
demonstrate a lack of approbation that risks the livelihood of
Taiwan's 23 million people for the sake of his political gambling, "
she said.</P>
      <P>Keeping the "five noes" in place in conjunction with the ROC
Constitution is critical to maintaining peace in Taiwan and the
strait, which is why the international community, including the
United States, has reacted with concern toward Taiwan after Chen
caused the controversy, she pointed out.</P>
      <P>Should the president have still failed to realize this key point,
a special envoy sent by the White House to Taipei to persuade him to
back away from his NUC abolishment plan should have told him why, she
added.</P>
      <P>According to local media reports, Dennis Wilder, a senior
official in charge of Asian affairs under the White House's National
Security Council, visited Chen last week to persuade him not to scrap
the NUC, but Chen remained unmoved.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, opposition People First Party (PFP) Legislator Chang
Hsieh-yao, who is also director of the PFP's Central Policy Center,
asked the government to provide a clear explanation of Wilder's
visit.</P>
      <P>David Huang, a legislative caucus whip of the pro-independence
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , argued that none of the parties
concerned should be allowed to use the unconfirmed report to
intimidate the Taiwan people and "dance to the tune of Beijing's
united front strategy."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Wednesday
that the National Unification Council (NUC) is an illegal
organization set up during the Kuomintang's (KMT) rule, and
abolishing it would be "purely a domestic issue."</P>
      <P>She told reporters she had seen nothing like the media described
as a "secret envoy" from the United States coming to Taiwan to
dissuade President Chen Shui-bian from going ahead with his proposal
to do away with the NUC and its Guidelines.</P>
      <P>"Neither have I seen the president facing any pressure [from the
U.S.]," she added.</P>
      <P>Lu said abolishing an illegal institute established in accordance
with a KMT Central Standing Committee resolution is nothing but a
domestic matter. What should catch the attention of the world, she
added, is the deployment of China's missiles targeted at Taiwan, a
belligerent act that she claimed is threatening the security of the
entire Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>There would not be any so-called crisis if China were not
targeting its missiles at Taiwan, she pointed out, asking, "Why isn't
the world putting some pressure on China?"</P>
      <P>She called on the international community to "look reasonably at
the real issue."</P>
      <P>She said the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government has
tolerated the NUC, which she claimed was set up "unreasonably, " for
"a long six years, " and that "it is time to tell the world enough is
enough."</P>
      <P>"Can you ask the KMT to implement a resolution adopted by the
DPP's Central Standing Committee?" she said.</P>
      <P>If the people of Taiwan were to face all the facts and feel that
Taiwan needs to unify with China, then unification could well be an
option that in the future would be dealt with in accordance with
constitutional procedures, she said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. CONGRESSMAN SAYS NO CHANGE IN ARMS DEAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb 22 (CNA)
(By Debby Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. House Representative Rob Simmons said
Wednesday that President George W. Bush supports Taiwan's arms
procurement deal and does not see any possible change in the deal
before the Bush administration leaves office in 2008.</P>
      <P>But Simmons, a Republican representing Connecticut and a member
of the House Taiwan Caucus, also warned that Taiwan is "running out
of time" on the U.S. arms procurement deal, that it is uncertain what
the next administration's stance will be, and that submarines are
"absolutely critical" for Taiwan's defense.</P>
      <P>"I also know that President Bush's policy is clear and he
supports the sale, " Simmons said. He dismissed reports that the U.S.
Navy is not cooperating with Taiwan's purchase of submarines,
pointing out that Commander of the U.S. Pacific Command William J.
Fallon recently showed full support for the deal and that no navy
officers would come out in public against the deal.</P>
      <P>"President Bush's position is clear: as the president of the
United States, he is the commander and chief of the U.S. Navy. And
nobody in the navy who values his or her career will publicly state
that they are opposed to the president's policy. That is an
unsupportable position to have," Simmons said.</P>
      <P>"This administration is clear with its policy. But in three years
the policy could change. It is really important to take advantage of
the opportunity the administration has offered and move forward
quickly with these programs," he said.</P>
      <P>Simmons made the statements in a speech before the American
Chamber of Commerce in Taipei and took questions from the chamber
members and the press.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that for U.S. national defense needs,
diesel-electric submarines cannot replace the strategic nuclear
submarine fleet. He said the alleged fears of certain people in the
United States that Congress might prefer the cheaper diesel-electrics
to the nuclear ones are "unfounded" and he added that he will not let
this fear get in the way of Taiwan's defense.</P>
      <P>Simmons said that in order to maintain the cross Taiwan-Strait
status quo and a regional balance of forces in the strait, "Taiwan
needs to increase its defense budget, even in moderate sums."</P>
      <P>"Less than 3 percent of gross domestic product is not enough.
That's a commitment the people of Taiwan have to make. The United
States will not stand up for those who do not stand up for
themselves," he warned.</P>
      <P>"How we handle the Taiwan Strait situation will largely determine
how we and the rest of the world deal with a rising China for decades
to come," he said.</P>
      <P>"A strong Taiwan will maintain the status quo of peace and
prosperity in the region," he added.</P>
      <P>Simmons also said that the arms procurement deal needs to be
re-examined and that the price, design and specifications of the
submarines needs to be re-evaluated.</P>
      <P>He also stressed the importance of cooperation between the United
States and Taiwan to "deter aggression and maintain the status quo."</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CENTRAL STANDING COMMITTEE ADOPTS RESOLUTION ON ABOLISHING NUC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Standing Committee of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) approved a resolution
Wednesday supporting the government's plan to dissolve the National
Unification Council (NUC).</P>
      <P>The party's decision-making body made the move after President
Chen Shui-bian told a visiting U.S. congressman earlier in the day
that the NUC was "an anachronism" that should be formally dismantled.
Vice President Annette Lu also said the NUC was "an illegal
institution" that should be removed since it was set up based on a
Kuomintang (KMT) Central Standing Committee resolution.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun said abolishing the NUC and its
Guidelines could stop China annexing Taiwan and thus help maintain
the status quo in the Taiwan Strait. He accused China of changing the
status quo while Taiwan has worked hard to maintain it.</P>
      <P>Yu said the people of Taiwan have step by step won the right to
decide their future -- from the election of all members of the
legislature, to direct balloting for president, to dissolving the
National Assembly and gaining the constitutional right to make
decisions through a referendum.</P>
      <P>"As we have insisted on reforms and implementing the principle of
self-determination, we now have the right to decide our own future.
This is a natural process of democratization," he said.</P>
      <P>He added that the NUC and its Guidelines are a product of an
authoritarian KMT rule, and the establishment of the NUC was not
based on the consent of the Legislative Yuan or the people.</P>
      <P>The NUC therefore had no legitimacy, he said, adding that it set
as a target eventual unification with China, in violation of the
democratic spirit of self-determination by all of its people.</P>
      <P>After China enacted its "Anti-Secession Law" last year, Yu said,
Taiwan's opposition leaders have echoed Beijing by attacking Taiwan's
democracy on the international stage and boycotting a government bill
for procuring advanced weapons, pushing the cross-strait military
balance to tilt in China's favor.</P>
      <P>He said at a time when the people of Taiwan are losing their
power to determine their future, abolishing the NUC could help
maintain the status quo in the Strait, stop Taiwan from tipping
toward unification with China and keep Taiwan from being gradually
annexed by China.</P>
      <P>The DPP's move won praise from its "pan-green" ally, the Taiwan
Solidarity Union, whose legislative caucus convener Huang Shih-chuo
said his party, which has long advocated doing away with the NUC, was
pleased to see the ruling camp "walking on the TSU's path."</P>
      <P>However, the main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) spokeswoman,
Cheng Li-wen, warned that scrapping the NUC and Guidelines means
backing down from the president's "five noes" commitment that he made
in his 2000 and 2004 inaugural addresses.</P>
      <P>Keeping the "five noes" in place in conjunction with the Republic
of China Constitution is critical for maintaining peace in Taiwan and
across the Strait, she said.</P>
      <P>In response to Beijing's allegation that Taiwan's moves toward
abrogating the NUC signify an "upgrading" of activities toward
independence, Government Information Minister Cheng Wen-tsan urged
China to understand that in order to stabilize cross-Strait
relations, all parties concerned must respect the right of Taiwan's
people to decide on their national sovereignty.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, all sectors of society agree that every major decision
must be made in accordance with democratic procedures on the
principle of "sovereignty lies with the people," Cheng said. "This is
the lowest common denominator in Taiwan."</P>

    <HEADLINE>SU YUNG-CHIN ELECTED NCC CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The curtain was finally raised on the
National Communications Commission (NCC) Wednesday, with Su
Yung-chin, a constitutional law expert, elected by fellow members as
head of the new organization.</P>
      <P>Nine NCC members met for the first time to elect among themselves
a chairman and two vice chairs.</P>
      <P>"It's a trend-setting move to allow NCC members to elect among
themselves head and deputy heads of the organization," Su said before
announcing the voting results. "The method will help reinforce the
NCC's neutrality and independence."</P>
      <P>Shih Shih-hau, a banking and financial law professor at National
Dong Hwa University, and Liu Tsung-teh, a legal professor at National
Chengchi University, were elected NCC vice chairs.</P>
      <P>They will formally take office at a swearing-in ceremony to be
held within seven days, according to the NCC Organic Law.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the NCC is a highly independent and transparent
administrative body aimed at establishing an effective, pluralistic
and impartial telecommunication market order, Su said all NCC members
will do their utmost to live up to the public's expectations.</P>
      <P>Su said the biggest challenge facing the NCC lies with its
ability to win the public's trust in its professionalism and
impartiality.</P>
      <P>Besides electing chair and vice chairs, NCC members also attended
to briefings by members also attended to briefings by the Government
Information Office and the Directorate General of Telecommunications
under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications on businesses
to be transferred to the NCC's jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>As the NCC members didn't discuss future work agenda during
Wednesday's meeting, Su said he will wait until the swearing-in
ceremony to expound on the NCC's future work plans.</P>
      <P>According to Su, all NCC members will meet at least once a week
and will hold a provisional meeting whenever necessarily. He also
predicted that it will take one year or two for the NCC to function
well.</P>
      <P>In line with the NCC Organic Law, the NCC should have 13 members.
One of the nominees asked to be dropped from the roster before the
Legislative Yuan vote on the list and three more members offered to
resign after the legislature approved the nomination list. Su said
he hopes that relevant political parties can nominate replacements to
fill all the four vacancies as soon as possible, particularly those
versed in information and telecommunication technologies.</P>
      <P>According to the law, Su said, the NCC will have a staff ranging
between 500 and 700.</P>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang has ordered relevant government agencies
to transfer staff, budget, property and archives to the NCC in
accordance with the law to ensure smooth operation of the new
organization.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the NCC has had a rough ride since the bill
concerning its organic law was delivered to the legislature for
ratification last year. Even after the law came into effect Nov. 9
and its 12 members were approved by the legislature in accordance
with the law Jan. 12, the NCC was still not able to begin
functioning.</P>
      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh refused to appoint the NCC
commissioners as soon as the legislature confirmed the list. Then,
his Cabinet asked the Council of Grand Justices (CGJ) Jan. 20 to
interpret the constitutionality of the NCC Organic Law, claiming that
it infringed upon the executive branch's constitutional powers and
thus seriously damaged the constitutional system. The Executive Yuan
also requested that the council impose an injunction suspending the
commission's establishment pending a constitutional ruling.</P>
      <P>Premier Su endorsed the NCC's roster last Friday only after
opposition parties threatened to boycott his administrative report
Feb. 21, the opening day of the new legislative session.</P>
      <P>As the opposition "pan-blue" alliance of the Kuomintang and the
People First Party holds a slim majority in the legislature,
"pan-blues"-recommended NCC members outnumber those recommended by
the "pan-green camp" led by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>The 13-member CGJ has begun reviewing the case and is scheduled
to hold a hearing March 8. The Executive Yuan and other relevant
organizations, scholars and experts will be invited to present their
views during the full-day hearing. After the hearing, it may still
take some time before the CGJ metes out its ruling on whether the NCC
is unconstitutional.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN OFFICIALS EXPLAIN TUNA CATCH REDUCTION EFFORTS IN U. S.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  21 (CNA)
(By Winnie Chi and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A delegation composed of Taiwanese
fisheries officials met their counterparts from the United States and
Canada Tuesday in the U.S. capital to explain Taiwan's efforts in
reducing its tuna catch in the high seas.</P>
      <P>Sha Chih-i, deputy director of the Fisheries Administration under
the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) , who heads the
delegation, said Tuesday that U.S. and Canadian officials praised
Taiwan's efforts toward that end after hearing a briefing by
Taiwanese officials.</P>
      <P>Sha noted that the three sides met to exchange views under
arrangements by U.S. authorities at a time when the Canadian
officials were also visiting the capital city.</P>
      <P>As the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic
Tuna (ICCAT) is slated to hold its 2006 annual conference by the end
of this year, Taiwan's delegation hopes to seek international backing
for the country's bid to push the ICCAT to resume previous quotas for
Taiwan's tuna catch, which was slashed by almost 70 percent by the
ICCAT late last year due to Taiwan's alleged overfishing.</P>
      <P>According to Sha, Taiwanese officials submitted a three-phase
program to elaborate on Taiwan's measures and timetable at the
gathering with U.S. and Canadian officials.</P>
      <P>During the present first phase, observers have been posted
onboard the 15 Taiwanese big-eye fishing boats that are allowed to
operate in international waters, he said.</P>
      <P>Secondly, 60 longfin tuna boats from Taiwan, in collaboration
with the United States, will periodically report their catch to the
ICCAT. Third, he added, the 42 Taiwanese fishing ships ordered to be
mothballed in Taiwan will be subject to satellite surveillance.</P>
      <P>According to Sha, Fisheries Administration officials also told
their U.S. and Canadian counterparts that Taiwan banned 59 fishing
vessels from catching tuna in international waters last year and will
further restrict 101 ships from doing so this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA HAS LEARNED TO KEEP MUM ON TAIWAN ISSUE: HONG KONG SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China has learned its lesson on how to
react to provocation by Taiwan, which is why it has chosen to remain
relatively mum on recent Taiwan-related issues, a Hong Kong political
analysts said Wednesday in Taipei. </P>
      <P>China has learned lessons through past experience and decided to
stay calm and not to ruffle feathers after Taiwan's President Chen
Shui-bian said he would consider abolishing the National Unification
Council and its Guidelines, said Willy Lam, a guest speaker at the
monthly luncheon of the European Chamber of Commerce in Taipei
(ECCT).</P>
      <P>Lam previously worked with the South China Morning Post in Hong
Kong and with CNN's Asia-Pacific headquarters. He is a Professor of
China and Global Studies at Japan's Akita International University,
while also a Senior Fellow at Jamestown Foundation, a Washington D.C.
foreign policy think tank.</P>
      <P>Concentrating on winning over all fronts in Taiwan will be
China's main focus, Lam said. The U.S. sending a special envoy to
Taiwan is the latest example of China's tactics, Lam said. China has
waited for the U.S.' response before delivering an overly dramatic
reaction.</P>
      <P>China is implementing the idea of "Three Harmonies" -- peace,
reconciliation and harmony -- advocated by Chinese President Hu
Jintao in handling the Taiwan issue and international affairs, he
said.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Taiwan issue, the same mindset also applies to
how China shapes new foreign policy.</P>
      <P>"For China to continue its [economic] development, it knows it
must ensure a peaceful environment. And they must pursue a good
neighbor policy, " Lam said.</P>
      <P>Beijing is also looking for a new relationship with the U.S., by
becoming stakeholders in international affairs instead of "strategic
competitors," a term that current U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice used to describe U.S.-China relations several years ago.</P>
      <P>China has used its influence in handling North Korea and Iran to
seek better relations with the U.S. and prove its interest in
participating in international affairs, Lam said.</P>
      <P>In trade and economic relations, Lam claimed that Beijing has
come up with a Robin Hood-style of operating as it runs up a trade
surplus with the rich countries while it increases investment and aid
to the poor.</P>
      <P>Hu has also replaced the "New Three Principles of the People, "
which he advocated shortly after being named president three years
ago, with the "Theory of the Three Harmonies," Lam said.</P>

(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China prefers opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
leader Ma Ying-jeou to win the 2008 Taiwan presidential election,
which means Taiwan's independence will be almost unachievable even
if the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) regains power in the
future, a Hong Kong political analyst said in Taipei Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Willy Lam, a Hong Kong citizen who has been a political analyst on
China relations for nearly 20 years, was invited by the European
Chamber of Commerce in Taipei (ECCT) to give a speech at its monthly
luncheon.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the future of Taiwan-China relations, Lam said China
would prefer Taiwan's opposition leader, KMT chairman Ma
Ying-jeou, to win back the presidential office in March 2008. And
China expects Ma to endorse the "One China" idea, he added.</P>
      <P>"One or two years afterwards," he said, "China expects the
'three direct links' to be established, after which Taiwan's economy
will depend even more on China."</P>
      <P>"Even if the DPP manages to return to power [in 2012], it will be
very difficult for even the party's radical wing to achieve
independence because the basic weapon, or basic ingredients, will be
diminished," Lam said.</P>
      <P>Lam previously worked with the South China Morning Post in Hong
Kong but was forced to leave the post by the Chinese government's
influence. Later he worked for CNN's Asia-Pacific headquarters.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb. 22 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States reiterated Wednesday
its opposition to any steps by either Taiwan or China that raise
cross-Taiwan Strait tensions or change the status quo.</P>
      <P>Washington believes that direct dialogue between authorities in
Beijing and the elected leadership in Taipei is the best way to
resolve questions in cross-strait relations, according to J. Adam
Ereli, deputy spokesman of the U.S. State Department.</P>
      <P>"We do not support Taiwan independence and we oppose steps by
either side that raise tensions or alter the status quo as we define
it," Ereli said.</P>
      <P>Ereli was explaining the U.S. position on whether Taiwan's
National Unification Council (NUC) and National Unification
Guidelines should be abolished.</P>
      <P>ROC President Chen Shui-bian first proposed Jan. 29 that the
country should seriously consider scrapping the NUC and its policy
guidelines, which were established by the former Kuomintang
government in 1990 and 1991, respectively, and are symbolic of
Taiwan's objective of unifying with China.</P>
      <P>In what has widely been interpreted as an indication that the
president is determined to go ahead with the plan, Chen said
Wednesday that the NUC and the guidelines should be abolished because
they are "absurd products of an absurd era" that violate the
democratic principle of sovereignty which lies with the people.</P>
      <P>Chen said the existence of the council and guidelines has
deprived the people of Taiwan of the right to have the final say in
the direction of cross-strait relations and has ruled out the
possibility of independence as an option for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>News reports have said that Washington sent two officials -- one
from the White House and the other from the State Department -- to
Taiwan last week to try to persuade Chen to drop the idea but that
Chen showed no intention of changing his mind.</P>
      <P>On these reports, Ereli said: "I don't have that level of detail
of what our diplomatic contacts with officials in Taiwan has been."</P>
      <P>However, he added that the United States has made clear to Taiwan
Washington's long-standing policy regarding cross-strait issues, both
in private and on public occasions.</P>
      <P>"Without getting into specifics on any one proposal or any one
idea, we are -- we have and we continue to make clear to the
authorities in Taipei that we oppose steps by either side that raise
tensions or that alter the status quo," he said.</P>
      <P>"It's a position that we reiterate very strenuously and
consistently in private and -- as I'm now doing, in public, " he
continued.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said the issue of Taiwan was raised during
Tuesday's meeting between U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Robert B.
Zoellick and Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi and that
Zoellick reiterated Washington's long-standing positions on that
issue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ABOLISHING NUC WOULD NOT CHANGE CROSS-STRAIT STATUS QUO: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Abolishing the National Unification Council
(NUC) and National Unification Guidelines would be consistent with
Taiwan's efforts to maintain the status quo across the Taiwan Strait,
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Minister Joseph Wu said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wu said he does not think the move would lead to cross-strait
tensions.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, President Chen Shui-bian said the NUC and the
guidelines should be abolished because they are "absurd products of
an absurd era" that violate the democratic principle of sovereignty
which lies with the people.</P>
      <P>Chen said the existence of the council and guidelines has
deprived the people of Taiwan of the right to have the final say in
the direction of cross-strait relations and has ruled out the
possibility of independence as an option for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On that same day, Chen Yunlin, director of China's Taiwan Affairs
Office, called the president's plan a "dangerous signal" indicating
that the pro-independence separatist movement in Taiwan is gearing
up. He also warned that if the president insists on going ahead with
the plan, it will do "severe damage" to cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the remarks by the Chinese official show that
Beijing does not understand Taiwan and has no desire to understand
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu pointed out that Taiwan is a democratic country, with its
people entitled to the right to choose their future of their own free
will.</P>
      <P>"The National Unification Council and National Unification
Guidelines are products of the Kuomintang-dominated authoritarian
era, which prescribe unification as the sole option on Taiwan's
future and are in no way consistent with the status quo," Wu said.</P>
      <P>On reports that the discussions between Taiwan and the United
States on the plan to abolish the NUC and the guidelines have come to
a stalemate because of their wide differences over the issue, Wu said
these reports are totally untrue.</P>
      <P>Wu said the two sides maintain smooth and effective
communication, both in terms of public and private channels.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ministry of Foreign Affairs deputy spokesman Wang
Chien-yeh said Taiwan continues to communicate with Washington on the
issue and that no other countries besides the United States have
expressed their opinions on the matter.</P>
      <P>In Washington, the U.S. State Department reiterated Wednesday
that the United States does not support Taiwan independence and
opposes steps by either Taiwan or China that raise cross-strait
tensions or change the status quo.</P>
      <P>It said the United States believes that direct dialogue between
authorities in Beijing and the elected leadership in Taipei is the
best way to resolve questions in cross-strait relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA CONCEALING BIRD FLU CASES: TAIWAN PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
China has been concealing avian flu cases in the country, making it a
"hole" in the global health protection net.</P>
      <P>In the president's latest e-letter posted on his Web site, Chen
noted that from the start of 2003 to mid-February of this year, the
World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed a total of 169 cases of
H5N1 infection in humans in China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Iraq,
Thailand, Cambodia and Turkey, with 91 of the cases resulting in
death.</P>
      <P>Now, avian flu is spreading westward to Western Europe, Chen
added.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the Chinese government confirmed a case of
H5N1 infection in a woman in Fujian Province 28 days after the woman
developed bird flu symptoms, much more than the 15 days required by
the WHO to confirm a bird flu case.</P>
      <P>"It is obvious that China has not learned a lesson from the SARS
outbreak in 2003," Chen said.</P>
      <P>China still covers up information about any pandemic in order to
avoid "losing face, " Chen claimed, adding that Beijing only faces
reality when the matter grows beyond its control.</P>
      <P>The president said this attitude poses a serious threat to the
health of the people in China, Taiwan and the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>In addition to concealing information, China has spared no effort
trying to obstruct Taiwan's efforts to join the WHO, thus creating
another "hole" in the global health protection net, the president
said.</P>
      <P>Noting that disease knows no borders, Chen stressed that public
health and disease prevention are topics that people around the world
should address jointly in this era of globalization and
liberalization.</P>
      <P>However, for political reasons, the Chinese government has
sacrificed the health of its people and isolated Taiwan in the global
disease prevention system, Chen said, adding that this "is the
international community's biggest regret."</P>
      <P>During the last 400 years, there have been 12 major flu
pandemics, with nine of these originating in China, while in the 20th
century, there were three major flu pandemics, all of which began in
China, the president said.</P>
      <P>Noting that people should not be careless about bird flu cases in
China, Chen said that the help of the Taiwan people is needed in the
world's disease prevention efforts. He also noted that Taiwan's
capabilities in disease prevention have been demonstrated by the fact
that the island has been able to remain avian flu-free to date.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN HAS RENEGED ON HIS OWN PLEDGE: KMT HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has reneged on his
own "five noes" pledge by proposing the scrapping of the National
Unification Council (NUC) and its policy guidelines, opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Ma, who doubles as Taipei mayor, said that President Chen broke
his "five noes" promise that he made in his two inauguration
speeches, in 2000 and 2004, by repeating his Jan. 29 proposal
Wednesday that the country should seriously consider scrapping the
NUC and the National Unification Guidelines, which were established
by the former KMT government in 1990 and 1991, respectively, and are
symbolic of Taiwan's objective of unifying with China eventually.</P>
      <P>Chen pledged clearly during his inauguration speech in May 2000
that as long as Beijing has no intention of using military force
against Taiwan, he will not declare independence, not change Taiwan's
name, not add the state-to-state theory into the Constitution, not
promote a referendum on the issue of independence versus unification,
and not scrap the National Unification Guidelines -- commonly known
as the "five noes" principle -- during his time in office.</P>
      <P>On Chen's about-face over policies on cross-Taiwan Strait
relations, Ma said that opposition parties are in no position to
exercise public authority and that the KMT technically cannot do much
except openly condemn the move.</P>
      <P>Ma said abolishing the NUC and its policy guidelines also runs
counter to the common wish of the Taiwan public, adding that it is
the last thing that President Chen, as the head of state, should
do.</P>
      <P>The KMT chairman reiterated that Taiwan independence is not an
option supported by the KMT and is only supported by a small minority
of the people in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, all that the KMT can do -- in the face of the heightened
controversy at home and abroad in the wake of Chen's proposal to
abolish the NUC -- is to try to make its stance known more clearly in
consideration of the fact that Taiwan is a democratic country and the
KMT is willing to respect other people's choice of independence as an
option, Ma explained.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CIVIC GROUP SUGGESTS PEACE EFFORTS ALONG WITH ABOLISHMENT OF NUC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If the government insists on abolishing the
National Unification Council (NUC) and National Unification
Guidelines, it should also put forth new guidelines aimed at
promoting peace across the Taiwan Strait and accommodating both
unification and independence as options available to the people of
Taiwan, a civic group said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Peacetime Foundation of Taiwan (PFT) said the NUC is an
outdated organization, not a sacred cow that must remain forever
enshrined. The problem is that when President Chen Shui-bian unveiled
his intention to do away with what he called "an anachronistic
institution, " he did not set forth a comprehensive set of
accompanying measures to replace them, according to the foundation.</P>
      <P>PFT Executive Director Chien Hsi-chieh suggested that when the
government announces the abolishment of the NUC and its Guidelines,
it should set new guidelines whose purpose is to promote cross-strait
peace and declare that both unification and independence are future
options for the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"A new set of guidelines will minimize the negative impacts of
abolishing the NUC on cross-strait relations and on Taiwan-United
States ties," he added.</P>
      <P>The last two years could have been the right time to improve
cross-strait ties, he said, but nothing has been achieved because of
a lack of trust between the Chinese leadership and Chen, forcing Chen
to seek a place in history that is on the other extreme of the
political spectrum, even at the cost of offending his American ally,
according to Chien.</P>
      <P>He expected Chinese President Hun Jintao and U.S. President
George Bush, who are scheduled to meet in Washington, D.C. in April,
to respond to recent controversial remarks made by Chen.</P>
      <P>"And that could cause great harm to Taiwan, " he said, adding
"that's why many friends of mine are saying that it's not the right
time to buy stocks before April."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE DEBUNKS 'EMISSARY' REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office refuted Thursday a
media report claiming that President Chen Shui-bian sent a secret
envoy to China in the second half of last year to explore the
possibility of resuming dialogue across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"The claim was sheer fabrication without making any sense, " the
Presidential Office's Public Affairs Department said in a news
release.</P>
      <P>Stressing that President Chen has never sent any individual to
China to engage in any talks with communist Chinese officials, the
press statement said the allegation was hearsay and guesswork.</P>
      <P>The media report quoted opposition Kuomintang Legislator Su Chi
as having claimed that Chen sent an emissary to Beijing to hold talks
with Chinese communist authorities on the possibility of resuming
cross-strait dialogue, but the talks broke down without achieving any
results.</P>
      <P>Su didn't deny the report, asserting that his information came
from two respectable individuals familiar with operations inside the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>As to whether the "emissary" mentioned in the report was former
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chen Ming-tong, Su said he would
neither confirm nor deny such speculation.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Chen Ching-jun, a DPP legislative whip,
called a news conference to discount the "emissary" report as
"fictitious." "Su purposely fabricated the 'emissary' story to
detract public attention from the dust-up over his lie about the
existence of a so-called '92 consensus' regarding the 'one China'
principle," Chen Ching-jun alleged.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Ching-jun, Chen Ming-tong, who is now a
National Taiwan University professor, indeed made an academic visit
to China last year. "But Chen Ming-tong was by no means a secret
envoy. His visit had nothing to do with politics," he added.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Chen Ching-chun's remarks, Su said he will not
evade any controversy surrounding the "92 consensus" because he had
coined the term back in 2000 with an aim to help break a lingering
cross-strait impasse.</P>
      <P>"I would not apologize for inventing the term because it marked a
pragmatic effort to break open the door to cross-strait dialogue and
reconciliation," Su said.</P>
      <P>In April 2000, Su, who was then MAC chairman, said officials from
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait reached a consensus during their
talks in Hong Kong in 1992 that there is only "one China" with each
side having its own interpretation of "one China." Only after former
President Lee Teng-hui said the so-called "92 consensus" was
non-existent earlier this week, Su publicly confessed to coining the
term for the first time.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 2006 Taiwan International Marathon is
scheduled to be held in Gukeng, Yunlin County, Feb. 28 with the
participation of nearly 8,000 runners from home and abroad, the head
of the National Council on Physical Fitness and Sports (NCPFS)
announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>NCPFS Minister Chen Chuan-show said the 2006 Yunlin international
marathon will be different from other marathons around the world as
it will take place on a long, straight highway, rather than having a
point of return.</P>
      <P>The Yunlin Marathon is also unique given that the more than
50-kilometer Expressway 78 in Gukeng will be a scenic route along
which runners will not only be able to enjoy the magnificent scenery,
but will also be treated to the region's specialty snack foods and
beverages along the way, such as Gukeng coffee, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The Yunlin Marathon will feature four categories, namely the
42.195-km marathon, the 10-km road run, the 4.2-km road run and the
Happy Child 1-km road run. A total of 952 runners have registered to
compete in the 42.195-km marathon.</P>
      <P>Prominent runners who have signed up for the race include Tobias
Heskia from South Africa, who has a marathon career best time of
2:13:00, Taiwan's top marathoner Wu Wen-chien, and woman marathoner
Hu Xiuying from China, whose best time is 2:38:00.</P>
      <P>Prize money in the Yunlin international marathon event tops over
NT$1.7 million, all to be contributed by the physical fitness and
sports council, Chen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRC SCHOLAR WARNS OF 'NON-PEACEFUL' RESPONSE TO CHEN'S NUC GAME</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If President Chen Shui-bian goes ahead to
abolish Taiwan's National Unification Guidelines (NUG), which commit
the self-governing island to eventual unification with China, Beijing
will definitely respond according to its "Anti-Secession Law, " which
threatens to use "non-peaceful means" to settle its disputes with
Taiwan, a Chinese scholar said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Guo Zhenyuan, a research fellow at the China Institute of
International Studies, dismissed reports that China has been relying
on the United States to handle Chen's repeated calls for doing away
with the National Unification Council and the National Unification
Guidelines.</P>
      <P>While China and the U.S. share an interest in maintaining peace
in the Taiwan Strait, Guo said, it does not mean China will do
nothing about the Taiwan issue, which he called "our own affair
[among the Chinese]" during an interview with CNA.</P>
      <P>He said Beijing's Anti-Secession Law lists three scenarios under
which it would employ "non-peaceful means" to settle the Taiwan
issue.</P>
      <P>"People will understand what is 'non-peaceful means' when Chen
Shui-bian implements his policy of abrogating the NUG -- it won't be
a peaceful way of doing things, anyway," he said.</P>
      <P>He quoted a Chinese saying which goes, "All laws must be
enforced, and strictly." Since the enactment of the Anti-Secession
Law, government authorities are bound to implement it; if they don't,
they will be breaking the law and will be charged with negligence of
duty, he added.</P>
      <P>He warned that those who think that China will not adopt
non-peaceful means to settle the Taiwan issue are overestimating
their intelligence. Such people will eventually get themselves
"covered all over with bruises," he warned.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRIVATE GROUPS TO AID 'CARD SLAVES' OVER REPAYMENT CONTROVERSIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 60 lawyers have signed up as
volunteer attorneys to help some 680 debtors, known as "credit card
slaves" who have failed to repay credit card debts or are mired in
controversies involving credit card debt repayment.</P>
      <P>The attorneys, sponsored by the Legal Aid Foundation and Alliance
of Fairness and Justice, will assist credit card debtors in
negotiating with their banks on settling debts, as well as seek lower
interest rates on credit card loans, said Lin Yung-sung, president of
the Legal Aid Foundation Taipei Branch.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, an increasing number of reports of suicide,
kidnapping and robbery motivated by the heavy pressure of repaying
credit card debts have "left Taiwan society jittery, " adding that it
is Legal Aid Foundation's hope that by offering assistance to the
"credit card slaves, " the lawyers will help solve some social
problems.</P>
      <P>Chien Hsi-chieh, president of the Alliance of Fairness and
Justice, argued that banks -- which operate public services as
businesses under franchise authorized and protected by the government
-- should bear social responsibility rather than issue credit cards
irresponsibly and then exploit cardholders who fail to repay the
debts they incur with credit cards that were acquired too easily.</P>
      <P>Chien said that helping "credit card slaves" solve their
repayment problems is tantamount to solving banks' bad debt problems.
He urged credit card-issuing banks to demonstrate their sincerity in
dealing with such problems and to stop being "bloodsuckers."</P>
      <P>According to opposition Kuomintang legislators Pan Wei-kang and
Chiu Yi, some 400,000 people in Taiwan have been affected by the
problem of credit card slavery, with combined debts topping over
NT$800 billion (US$24.69 billion).</P>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said earlier this month that the
government is very concerned about the issue of credit card slavery
and the social problems that it causes.</P>
      <P>Su noted that banks are prohibited from hiring debt collectors
with gang-affiliated backgrounds to push credit card debtors to repay
their debts.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, officials from the Financial Supervisory Commission
said the commission has 20 telephone hotlines for credit card debtors
to complain about their plight or ask for help.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Seven members of a Taiwanese search and
rescue team of volunteers working at the site of a landslide in the
Philippines were pulled out of danger by a U.S. helicopter Thursday
after being trapped in a new mudflow caused by heavy rain.</P>
      <P>The task of the seven rescuers was to search for survivors, but
when they saw a corpse floating down a stream and retrieved it out of
respect for the dead, they were trapped on a slope by a new mudflow.</P>
      <P>They called the search and rescue operations center, which
immediately dispatched a US Marine helicopter to pull them out of
danger along with the body they had retrieved.</P>
      <P>The 34-member volunteer unit, headed by team leader Lu
Cheng-tsung, carried advanced heat-sensing equipment and was joined
by rescue workers from six other countries.</P>
      <P>For four days, members of the Taiwanese team have been digging
for possible survivors in the farming village of Guinsaugon on Leyte
island, which had been buried by a massive landslide Feb. 17 after
two weeks of heavy rain.</P>
      <P>So far, no survivors have been found after the initial rescue
mission that pulled out nearly 60 people alive.</P>
      <P>Most rescue teams from other countries were preparing to call off
the search Wednesday because they believed those buried under 30
meters of mud simply had no chance of survival. However, they changed
their minds after the Taiwanese team discovered a live chicken in a
buried house, rekindling hope there might be more survivors.</P>
      <P>After the close call for the Taiwanese rescuers, the operations
center ordered all rescue teams to suspend the search due to poor
weather conditions.</P>
      <P>According to official statistics, rescue workers have dug out 122
bodies in the past week. An estimated 900 people are still missing
and presumed to be dead.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
he has firmly upheld the concept of "Taiwan sovereign identity" to
reflect what he claimed is mainstream public opinion for the sake of
the national interest and the people's benefit.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in a speech delivered at a news conference
held by the Government Information Office following a selection award
ceremony for a project titled "Taiwan images, " illustrating various
aspects of Taiwan, its people and the country. Premier Su Tseng-chang
also attended the event.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the "Taiwan sovereign identity" has become the
consensus among Taiwan's 23 million people, Chen said that since
assuming the presidency in 2000, he has been committed to protecting
mainstream values to safeguard the country's security, highlight its
international status and counter a trend in Taiwan in recent years
favoring a closer relationship with China.</P>
      <P>After having been ruled by different regimes in the past, Taiwan
has succeeded in transforming itself into a democracy that witnessed
its first peaceful power transfer in 2000, the president said, adding
that with democratic values taking root in Taiwan, the country has
developed into a pluralistic multi-faceted society.</P>
      <P>In the face of stiff international competition, Taiwan must brace
for external challenges while preserving its good traditions and
culture and trying to make itself known to the world, he said, adding
that globalization and localization are "not totally contradictory."
A refined culture featuring folkloric flavor is the essence of what
he described as "global localization," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCRAPPING NUC GOOD FOR TAIWAN'S DEMOCRACY: DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The people of Taiwan have the right to say
"no" to unification with China, and scrapping the National
Unification Council (NUC) would be good for Taiwan's democracy, Chen
Chin-jun, a legislative caucus whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Citing main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's
view that also favors Taiwan's independence as one possible option,
Chen said that it is right to abolish the illegally founded NUC and
its guidelines because they set the stage for Taiwan's unification
with China. The move would further cement democracy and strengthen
sovereignty in Taiwan, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks came after the ruling DPP supported moving ahead
with the plan in a Central Standing Committee meeting a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng expressed the hope later
Thursday that President Chen Shui-bian could deal with the issue
"more cautiously" in order to minimize its impact on society.
</P>
      <P>Speaking at a Legislative Yuan news conference, Pan Wei-kang, a
KMT legislative caucus whip, blasted the DPP for passing a resolution
Wednesday endorsing Chen's plan to scrap the NUC.</P>
      <P>Pan accused the DPP of falling into step with Chen and argued
that the move could whip up serious consequences and possibly
undermine Taiwan-U.S. relations at the expense of Taiwan's public
interest.</P>
      <P>She said that the KMT would team up with the People First Party
(PFP) and other opposition parties to initiate a resolution Friday at
the Legislative Yuan to condemn what she said is President Chen's
"willful decision" to abolish the NUC.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lai Shyi-bao said that from the perspective of the
United States, President Chen's intention to do away with the NUC
demonstrated a violation of the "five noes" policy outlined in Chen's
2000 and 2004 inaugural speeches.</P>
      <P>Dissolving the NUC is eliminating one "no" out of the "five noes"
-- something that would be deemed by the United States as unilateral
change made by Taiwan to the cross-Taiwan Strait status quo, and a
move that Washington would not tolerate, he said.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, several polls have showed that more than 70
percent of Taiwanese people favor maintaining the status quo across
the strait and expect the government to focus on improving the
economy. He urged the public to stand up against the government
should it insist on abrogating the NUC.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Su Chi, a former head of the Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council, warned that the United States may sever
links with the government if President Chen failed to live up to his
"five noes" promise.</P>
      <P>"The president has underestimated the United States and has
misjudged the situation," Su said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, PFP legislative caucus members have asked President
Chen to explain his decision to scrap the NUC at the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>"A written statement will not bind Chen so more concrete
countermeasures must be in place," they claimed.</P>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Huang Chih-fang or Representative to
the United States David Lee should at least brief Taiwan's lawmakers
about the latest development in Taiwan-U.S. relations, PFP Legislator
Liu Wen-hsiung opined.</P>
      <P>Liu prodded the KMT and the PFP to join forces to counter
President Chen's NUC plan by adjourning the current legislative
session indefinitely if there was no response to their demand.</P>
      <P>PFP legislative caucus whip Lee Hong-jyun accused both the DPP
and the KMT of turning a blind eye to the people's misery and
welfare, saying that they lacked far-reaching strategies to handle
issues of major concern to Taiwan's future.</P>

Taiwan is a land of opportunity where people are rewarded handsomely
for their hard work.</P>

dirtiest, while the hands of the hard-working people are cleanest."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Benefiting from a buoyant business climate
at home and abroad in the second half of 2005, Taiwan's overall
economic growth is expected to expand by 4.25 percent this year, up
0.17 percent from the previously targeted 4.08 percent, the
government reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) said Taiwan's economy posted a growth of 6.4
percent in the fourth quarter of 2005, allowing the country to secure
an annual economic growth of 4.09 percent for the entire year.</P>
      <P>Judging from brisk performances in various business and
industrial sectors that were continued from the second half of 2005,
the officials said the economic growth this year should be better
than last year, prompting them to readjust the 2006 growth upward.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, export orders received by Taiwan exporters and
manufacturers in January surged by 20.01 percent to reach US$22.11
billion, which was US$3.69 billion more than the figure posted in the
same month of 2005, DGBAS officials said.</P>
      <P>The index of industrial production also rose in January, the
officials reported, noting that Taiwan's January industrial
production index stood at 132.61 points, up 4.39 percent over the
year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>The figure, however, represented a decline of 7.24 percent from
December, which the officials attributed to factors including the
Lunar New Year holiday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHIANG KAI-SHEK'S GRANDSON SUES AUTHORS OF 228 REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23  (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A grandson of late President Chiang
Kai-shek filed a libel suit Thursday against the sponsor and authors
of a book that identifies Chiang as a key perpetrator in the 228
Incident of 1947 in which thousands of people in Taiwan were
massacred.</P>
      <P>John Chiang, who is a legislator of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT), claimed the book was untruthful, tainted by political
influence, deliberately kept hidden some historical facts, and has
seriously defamed his grandfather.</P>
      <P>Chiang said it was immoral and malicious of the foundation to
release the report when the country was making every effort to try
to heal from the wounds of the 228 Incident.</P>
      <P>The targets of the suit include Chen Chin-huang, chairman of the
228 Memorial Foundation that sponsored the book, as well as Chen
Yi-shen and Chang Yen-hsien, the two local historians who carried out
the research.</P>
      <P>The legislator is asking for NT$5 billion (US$154 million) in
compensation and for an apology to be published in major newspapers.
He said he made the move after the concerned parties refused to
apologize as he had requested.</P>
      <P>Entitled "The 228 Incident: A Report on Responsibility, " the
590-page book released Feb. 19 argued that the KMT should be held
responsible for the 228 Incident because the party's leaders at the
time of the massacre -- then president Chiang Kai-shek and then
Taiwan Governor Chen Yi -- were its masterminds.</P>
      <P>The book argues that Chiang ordered troops to be dispatched from
China to "maintain order" in Taiwan because the protests, which had
spread from Taipei to other areas around the island, were deemed
"treasonous."</P>
      <P>The book contends that the military crackdown against the
uprising was a criminal act committed by the KMT and that the current
government has the right to bring the former ruling party to justice,
although the statute of limitations is 20 years.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident is named after the rebellion sparked on Feb. 28,
1947, against what the book calls the KMT's "corrupt and brutal"
regime. It has been estimated that some 30,000 people were killed by
KMT troops in the months following the rebellion.</P>

Taiwan, according to the company's marketing president Hiroyuki Oda.</P>
      <P>Oda declined to disclose information regarding sales revenue or

      <P>David Hsieh, vice president of DisplaySearch, a marketing

competitive price to Taiwanese consumers because the company has a

good price.</P>
      <P>"According to our research, Sony was also the world's leader in

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's towel makers urged the government
Thursday to impose restrictions on towel imports from China, which
have captured 70 percent of Taiwan's market and driven major towel
manufacturers in Taiwan out of business.</P>
      <P>Lin Kuo-lung, general secretary of the Yunlin County Towel
Industry Technology Development Association, told a press conference
at the Legislative Yuan that if the Ministry of Economic Affairs does
not take swift action to resolve the crisis faced by Taiwan's towel
industry, more than 1,000 people from the industry will stage a
demonstration March 2.</P>
      <P>Lin pointed out that four years after Taiwan joined the World
Trade Organization, local towel makers have lost 50 percent of their
market share to cheap imports from China.</P>
      <P>He urged the government to negotiate with China and resolve the
issue by placing safeguard curbs on imports from across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Although the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has suggested
that the local towel industry redress the situation by building an
anti-dumping case against China, with a likely favorable result
expected as early as June 20, most Taiwanese towel makers are opposed
to the proposal as they think the move would be too time-consuming.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the International Trade Commission under
the MOEA show that Taiwan's towel production dropped 50 percent from
1.1 million kg in 2001 to 770,000 kg in 2005.</P>
      <P>The country's largest towel manufacturer collapsed at the end of

    <HEADLINE>TRAVEL RATES UP, FEWER CONTAINERS HANDLED: MOTC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Outbound and inbound travel increased in
January, but ports in Taiwan handled fewer containers, according to
the most recent statistics released Thursday by the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC).</P>
      <P>Last month, Taiwan people made some 670,000 visits abroad, up by
17.3 percent year on year, the MOTC tallies show. Taiwanese travelers
made 210,000 visits to Hong Kong, an annual growth of 7.9 percent,
while Japan received over 110,000 visits by Taiwan people, making it
the second-largest overseas destination for Taiwan travelers.</P>
      <P>Foreign arrivals totaled about 260,000 in January, an 8.2 percent
rise compared to the previous year's level. Japanese people comprised
the bulk, making around 90,000 visits to Taiwan and marking a 3.4
percent drop year on year. Visitors from Hong Kong and Macau were the
second-largest group, making a combined 30,000 visits, largely up
from the 2005 level of 38.4 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, major ports around Taiwan -- Keelung in the north,
Taichung in central Taiwan and Kaohsiung in the south -- dealt with a
total of 1.03 million twenty-foot equivalent (TEU) containers in
January, a drop of 2.6 percent compared to the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung, the largest port in Taiwan, handled 770,000 TEUs,
while Keelung and Taichung dealt with 170,000 and 100,000,
respectively, according to the MOTC statistics.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP PRODS RESIDENT TO ABOLISH 'ONE-CHINA' CONSTITUTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Opposition People First Party (PFP) on
Thursday challenged President Chen Shui-bian, who has expressed
interest in considering abolishing the National Unification
Guidelines, to get to the root of the problem and abrogate the
country's "one-China" Constitution.</P>
      <P>Chang Hsien-yao, director of the PFP Policy Center, claimed that
Chen is being illogical in his idea of doing away with the National
Unification Council and the National Unification Guidelines, which he
described as nothing but a printed document.</P>
      <P>"If indeed he cannot accept unification with China as an option
for Taiwan, he might as well abolish Taiwan's `one China'
Constitution," he said, referring to the fact that there was only one
China when the Republic of China Constitution was promulgated in
1947. The PRC was not established until 1949.</P>
      <P>Also, the president might as well delete the phrase "before the
country is unified" in the statute governing the relations between
the people of Taiwan and the people of the mainland, Chang added.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the opposition parties give the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) a free hand to push through its
proposal to initiate a new constitution, so that the people will
finally realize what serious consequences the DPP's independence
agenda will bring about.</P>
      <P>He alleged that the president's raising of the idea of abrogating
the National Unification Guidelines is an attempt to divert attention
away from the poor track records of his government and the recent
spate of corruption scandals involving his senior aides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT REITERATES IMPORTANCE OF TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC AUTONOMY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  23  (CNA)
(By Debby Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reiterated
Thursday that his "active management, effective opening" policy is
designed to ensure that Taiwan's economy is not "misrepresented" or
"downgraded" and said the government needs to be a "responsible risk
manager."</P>
      <P>"This policy directive should not be simplified into a dichotomy
of either 'relaxation' or 'retrenchment of our policies,'" Chen said.</P>
      <P>He made the statement in a speech to the American Chamber of
Commerce (AmCham) at the chamber's 2006 Hsieh Nien Fan (thanks for
the year) dinner, an occasion to show appreciation for local
officials, businessmen and academics for cooperation with the foreign
business community. Acting American Institute in Taiwan Director
David J. Keegan, and AmCham President Tom Johnson were present, as
was Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who made a short address after Chen
had left.</P>
      <P>Chen also said there is a "steadfast partnership" between Taiwan
and the United States.</P>
      <P>"I firmly believe that steadfast partnership, candid and
pragmatic communication, constructive democratic alliance and
mutually prosperous economic and trade relations are the four pillars
that support Taiwan-U.S. relations," Chen said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan-U.S. relations are founded on broad-based and
multifaceted political cooperation, economic prosperity, peace and
security, community of democracies, humanitarianism, international
participation and civic exchanges. Therefore, the relations between
Taiwan and the United States should not be viewed merely from a
political vantage point," he added.</P>
      <P>Chen used Brokeback Mountain, a movie by Taiwanese director Ang
Lee and a frontrunner in this year's Oscars, as an analogy for the
relations between Taiwan and the United States.</P>
      <P>"The most profound lesson we must take away transcends the
narration of the love affair in the movie. It motivates us, instead,
to understand that all of us are bound to make difficult decisions in
life, yet we must strive to dispel prejudice, create trust, uphold
mutual respect and seek ways to reconcile and cooperate with one
another, because only by so doing can we together reach the frontier
of a 'great new world,'" Chen said.</P>
      <P>"I deeply believe that the common pursuit of a 'great new world'
by both Taiwan and the United States will guide us to a place where
the universal values of democracy, freedom, peace and prosperity can
be fully realized in the world we share," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that the seven priority recommendations proposed
by AmCham in its 2005 Taiwan White Paper have been "at the forefront
of the administration's policy agenda" and that the government has
achieved preliminary results in some fields.</P>
      <P>The seven recommendations include: the elimination of government
restrictions on business hiring decisions; upgrading Taiwan's public
health and healthcare environment; tightening intellectual property
protection; insisting on world-class infrastructure; building
aggressively on economic synergies with China; completing essential
financial reforms; and strengthening the fight against corruption.</P>

(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP)
will be forced to consider a series of countermeasures if President
Chen Shui-bian insists on abolishing the National Unification Council
(NUC), a PFP legislator quoted PFP Chairman James Soong as saying
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung said Soong is extremely displeased with
the president's "disregard of Taiwan people's interests and security"
and has instructed the PFP caucus at the legislature to take concrete
action against any plan to abolish the National Unification Council.</P>
      <P>He said that in addition to issuing a verbal condemnation, the
countermeasures might include calling for an indefinite adjournment
of the current legislative session, demanding a recall of the
president and proposing a referendum at an appropriate time to gauge
public opinion.</P>
      <P>He said the matter has become "extremely serious" because the
Central Standing Committee of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
has endorsed the president's plan.</P>
      <P>Liu indicated that the PFP legislative caucus will ask the
president to come to the Legislative Yuan to explain why he wants to
abolish the National Unification Council and the National Unification
Guidelines.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Minister of Foreign Affairs Huang Chih-fang and
Taiwan's representative to the United States, David Lee, should brief
the legislature on how the plan has affected relations between Taiwan
and the United States, he said.</P>
      <P>Liu warned that if the PFP's requests are ignored, the party
caucus will work with the legislative caucus of the main opposition
Kuomintang to suspend the current legislative session indefinitely to
show that the Legislative Yuan does not approve of the ruling party's
move.</P>

      <P>Director
David J. Keegan said Thursday that the U.S cross-Taiwan Strait policy
is unchanged and that the United States hopes Taiwan will not depart
from "that strong foundation."</P>
      <P>Keegan also said that the vitality and attractiveness of Taiwan's
economy is closely tied to Taiwan-based businesses' ability to
capitalize on the opportunities in China.</P>
      <P>"American policy on cross-strait issues is firm and unchanging.
Our strong desire is that Taiwan's policy does not depart from that
strong foundation," Keegan said.</P>
      <P>"It has served us and the Taiwan people very well over the past
several decades. And just as clearly, we want to see Beijing enter
into direct dialogue with the elected representatives of Taiwan. We
are pleased that tensions in the strait have diminished from the
peaks that we have seen in the past," he went on.</P>

will be to manage the challenges and opportunities of globalization.
Integration of economies around the world is a fact of life, " Keegan
said.</P>
      <P>"The just-concluded Lunar New Year charter flights remind us that
progress is possible when both sides are prepared to work together.
We are encouraged by progress toward weekend and cargo charter
flights through formal contacts between industry associations, " he
added.</P>
      <P>Keegan also highlighted intellectual property rights, Taiwan's
National Communications Commission (NCC) and the Doha Round of the
WTO as challenges Taiwan faces in 2006.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan wishes to retain its edge in telecommunications
technology, the NCC's independence and vision on topics such as media
ownership and the future convergence of the broadcast and telecom
industries will be crucial," Keegan said.</P>
      <P>The Doha Round "will require politically difficult decisions,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Internet penetration rate stood at
65.07 percent in January 2006, with the number of Internet users
increasing by 1,476 compared with the figure six months earlier,
according to the results of a survey released recently by the Taiwan
Network Information Center (TWNIC).</P>
      <P>The survey shows that 68.68 percent of men in Taiwan are Internet
users, which is higher than the 63.27 percent among women; and more
than 87 percent of the people in the 12-35 age group are Internet
users.</P>
      <P>While 11.62 million people in Taiwan, or 59.93 percent of the
population, have broadband Internet access, the penetration rate is
the highest in Taipei City (73.68 percent) , followed by Kaohsiung
City (69.59 percent).</P>
      <P>By region, the broadband Internet penetration rate among
individuals in Taiwan is highest in the northern part of the country,
at 63.46 percent, and lowest in the eastern part, at 50.80 percent,
according to the survey.</P>
      <P>It also shows that 5.32 million households in Taiwan, or 73.39
percent of all households in the country, have access to the
Internet, with 4.7 million households, or 64.81 percent, having
broadband Internet access.</P>
      <P>The home broadband Internet penetration rate is highest in Taipei
City (73.68 percent), followed by Kaohsiung City (75.30 percent). The
figure for the northern part of the country is 70.84 percent,
compared with 49.98 percent for the eastern part.</P>
      <P>However, among those households that currently do not have
broadband Internet access, only 17.69 percent expressed an interest
in installing broadband within the next six months.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted between Dec. 5, 2005 and Jan. 16, 2006
on 3,039 Taiwan residents 12 years of age or older. It has a margin
of error of plus or minus 1.79 percentage points.</P>
      <P>As shown in similar surveys conducted by the TWNIC every six
months over the past three years, the number of Internet and
broadband Internet users, as well as the penetration rates and home
access to the Internet have all been rising steadily, said Hsieh
Pang-chang, a professor of statistics and information science at Fu
Jen Catholic University, who coordinated the surveys.</P>
      <P>An estimate based on the most recent survey indicates that 18.38
percent of the population in Taiwan, or 3.56 million people, have
wireless Internet access, which also represents a significant
increase compared with past surveys, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>In terms of broadband Internet access, the number of households
using cable modems provided by local cable television operators has
also risen in the last two surveys, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ATTRACTING O'SEAS TAIWAN CAPITAL BACK HOME TO BE PRIORITY: TSAI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  24  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Invigorating the stock market and
attracting China-based Taiwan businesspeople's capital to flow back
into Taiwan will be among the administration's top priorities in
promoting economic development, Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Tsai made the remarks while calling on the legislative caucus of
the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , an ally of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, to communicate with them on the nation's economic
and financial policies.</P>
      <P>David Huang, TSU caucus whip in the legislature, said that Tsai,
as the convener of an economic and financial task force under the
Executive Yuan, also promised to address the grievances of Taiwan
towel manufacturers who have complained that since Taiwan joined the
World Trade Organization in January 2002, local towel makers have
lost 50 percent of their market share to cheap imports from China.</P>
      <P>Tsai pledged to take swift action to protect the traditional
industry, although she added that local towel makers should also take
steps to upgrade their competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan will also ask the Financial Supervisory
Commission to strengthen the regulation of foreign capital, Huang
cited Tsai as saying.</P>
      <P>To promote the upgrading of local industry as well as to attract
overseas-based Taiwan businesspeople back to the country, Tsai said
that the administration is considering taking steps to lower the
price of acquiring land and improve the amenities in order to lure 
manufacturers to set up plants in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, she promised that the administration will make an
overall review of direct cross-strait transportation links so as to
provide Taiwan businesspeople with a more convenient option in
traveling between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, adding however
that China's respect for Taiwan's sovereignty is still a precondition
for implementing such links.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taiwan businesspeople operating in China can travel
across the strait via the "mini three links" route connecting the
Chinese province of Fujian and the two Taiwan-controlled offshore
islands of Kinmen and Matsu. Direct cross-strait charter flights have
also been available during the Chinese New Year holiday in recent
years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MINISTRY OF EDUCATION PROMOTES PHYSICAL FITNESS AT COLLEGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb  24 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) urged
domestic universities and colleges to pay more attention to physical
education Friday as the results of an evaluation report show that
physical fitness levels among university and college students have
dropped significantly.</P>
      <P>At a meeting with presidents of universities around the country,
Ho Chuo-fei, director of the MOE's Physical Education Department,
noted that only 22 percent of Taiwan students exercise regularly,
much less than the 50 percent to 60 percent seen in other developed
countries.</P>
      <P>The statistics also show that 66.5 percent of university students
exercise less than twice a week, with only 25 percent of the students
ever participating in sports-related school clubs. Meanwhile, only
33.49 percent of students exercise more than three days a week.</P>
      <P>Ho attributed Taiwan university students' decreasing physical
fitness levels to the changes in the social environment and the
increasing amount of time students spend surfing the Internet.</P>
      <P>Criticizing some universities for not placing much focus on
physical education, Ho stressed that the decreasing physical fitness
levels among Taiwan students will lower the country's competitiveness
in the future and result in more deaths in the workplace due to
exhaustion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a survey conducted by Shih Hsin University at the
commission of the Department of Health last year showed that 68
percent of university or college students smoke or drink alcohol
regularly, while another MOE survey conducted last year found that
1.3 percent of university freshmen are addicted to drugs.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the Ministry of the Interior
in 2003, the fertility rate among Taiwan girls aged 15-19 reached
10.98 percent, much more than that in South Korea, Japan or
Singapore, which ranged from 2.8 percent to 8.0 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET TO WORK TOWARD BOOSTING DEFENSE SPENDING: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday that his
administration will work toward increasing the national defense
budget to 2.85 percent of the country's gross domestic product by
next year.</P>
      <P>The premier was responding to questions by Legislator Shen Fa-hui
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party who asked whether the
Executive Yuan will be able to carry out President Chen Shui-bian's
pronouncements in August 2004 that the national defense budget should
be increased to 3 percent of GDP within three years and early
this year that the budget should be raised to 2.85 percent
of GDP in 2007.</P>
      <P>Shen pointed out that this year's national defense budget is only
2.42 percent of GDP, noting that it will need to be increased by
NT$47.2 billion (US$1.41 billion) to reach 2.85 percent of GDP and by
NT$63.2 billion to reach 3 percent of GDP.</P>
      <P>Shen further asked whether increasing the national defense budget
will "squeeze" spending in other areas.</P>
      <P>Su noted that China has yet to renounce the option of the use of
force against Taiwan and has continued to increase its deployment of
missiles targeting Taiwan, pointing out that any country facing this
situation would have to increase its national defense spending.</P>
      <P>He also noted that China has increased its national defense
budget by double-digit figures each year for the last 15 years, while
Taiwan has continued to cut its defense spending, which he said
has tilted the military balance across the strait in China's favor.</P>
      <P>Su said that this is why he mentioned in his administrative
report that Taiwan must duly increase its national defense spending
"to demonstrate its resolve to defend itself."</P>
      <P>He has asked the Ministry of National Defense and the Directorate
General of the Budget, Accounting and Statistics to coordinate on the
matter so as to carry out President Chen's call to boost national
defense spending, Su said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER MAC HEAD ASKED TO RESIGN FOR '1992 CONSENSUS' FIB</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 24 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers from the pro-independence Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) demanded Friday that former Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) Chairman Su Chi resign from his current legislator post
within one week for fabricating the so-called "1992 consensus"
regarding the "one China" principle six years ago.</P>
      <P>They also asked opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
to apologize to the public for the matter and said they will sue Su,
currently a KMT legislator, if he refuses to resign.</P>
      <P>According to TSU legislative caucus convener David C. Huang, Su
is not qualified to be a legislator because he has deceived the
people of Taiwan for the last six years for making up what he called
the "1992 consensus" between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-ming, another TSU legislator, claimed the lie made by Su
has helped the KMT cheat a lot of votes out of voters in the past six
years, which he said has blocked the "pan-green camp" of the TSU and
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) from securing a majority in the
legislature.</P>
      <P>Accusing Su of "singing a duet with China, " Lo said the
non-existent "1992 consensus" has become the rationale used by
Beijing to refuse to resume dialogue with Taipei.</P>
      <P>He said that not only the general public, but also former KMT
Chairman Lien Chan, opposition People First Party Chairman James
Soong and Ma have been cheated by Su. He added that Su should be held
fully responsible for the situation.</P>
      <P>The KMT claims that in landmark talks held between Taipei and
Beijing in Hong Kong in 1992 when the KMT was in power, the two sides
agreed on allowing each other to interpret in their own way the
meaning of the "one-China" principle. This agreement has been termed
by the party as the "1992 consensus."</P>
      <P>Differing from what the KMT says, Beijing claims that Taiwan and
China both agreed to adhere to the "one China" principle in 1992 and
insists that Taiwan accept this principle as a precondition for
resuming cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>The current DPP government insists that the "1992 consensus" is
non-existent.</P>
      <P>Earlier this week, Su admitted that he created the term in 2000
shortly before the DPP's Chen Shui-bian was inaugurated as president,
in order that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait could have a "basis
for dialogue."</P>
      <P>Su said he did so because he realized that the pro-independence
DPP would not accept "one China" and hoped the term would be vague
enough to be accepted by both Taipei and Beijing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'CREDIT CARD DEBT SLAVES' SUE FINANCIAL SUPERVISORY COMMISSION CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  24 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A man describing himself as a "slave of
credit card debt, " filed a lawsuit Friday at the Taipei District
Prosecutor's Office against the head of the Financial Supervisory
Commission (FSC) , Kong Jaw-sheng, as well as against FSC Banking
Bureau Director Tseng Kuo-lieh.</P>
      <P>Liu Pao-sheng said he was representing a group of 55 "credit card
slaves" in suing Kong and Tseng for misconduct in office. He claimed
that their dereliction of duty has allowed financial institutions to
issue credit cards irresponsibly and to increase credit lines at
will.</P>
      <P>The generous loan conditions have tempted credit card users to
over-extend their credit, leaving them unable to repay their debts.
As a result, society has seen an increasing number of suicides or
robberies by credit card debtors, Liu said.</P>
      <P>As the FSC has failed to monitor the situation, some credit card
issuance companies have hired debt collectors with gang-affiliated
backgrounds, who have threatened and intimidated the debtors.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Liu claimed that despite the establishment of a
so-called debt negotiation mechanism Dec. 15, 2005, the two FSC
executive officials have still failed to push major credit card
issuers around the nation to implement the mechanism in order to
assist credit card slaves to repay their debts.</P>
      <P>Kong and Tseng deserve to be sued because their misconduct in
office has brought unrest to society, Liu said. He made no mention of
the issue of a sense of personal responsibility among people who
choose to spend money they do not have.</P>
      <P>Liu's action won the support of Legislator Liu Chung-hsiung of
the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Friday, who expressed hope that the
FSC will act to "serve the people instead of the banks " and said the
KMT is preparing to propose a draft bill next week at the Legislative
Yuan regulating the repayment of credit card debt.</P>
      <P>KMT legislators Pan Wei-kang and Chiu Yi have demanded that
Premier Su Tseng-chang find a way to resolve the problem of credit
card slavery, which affects 400,000 people in Taiwan who have
combined debts totalling more than NT$800 billion (US$24.69 billion).</P>

Friday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER) officials made the
prediction in an analysis of the country's latest economic situation.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that Taiwan's trade surplus shrank in the
first three quarters of 2005, but with a dramatic increase of exports
and a slowdown of imports starting from the third quarter of 2005,
the shrinking trade surplus situation has continued to improve, with
the result that the overall trade surplus in 2005 increased by 27.2
percent from 2004.</P>
      <P>They noted that export orders totalled US$24.59 billion in
December 2005, slightly lower than the US$24.61 billion in November
but still the third-largest in a single month.</P>
      <P>They said exports totaled US$16.84 billion in January this year,
up 4.5 percent from the same month of the previous year, showing that
even though manufacturers of electronic parts and components -- prime

exports have still maintained momentum.</P>
      <P>Imports in January totaled around US$14.51 billion, down 7

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION WARNS OF 'OVERALL BOYCOTT' AGAINST SCRAPPING NUC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  24 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers from major opposition parties
warned Friday of an overall boycott against President Chen
Shui-bian's plan to scrap the National Unification Council (NUC) and
its guidelines, saying that "all options" will be mulled to counter
Chen's move.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, head of the policy coordination committee under
the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), KMT legislative caucus whip Pan
Wei-kang, People First Party (PFP) legislative caucus whip Lu
Hsueh-chang and Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU) lawmakers Tsai
Hau and Kao Chin Su-mei issued the warning at a news conference held
at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>They urged Chen to think again about his NUC abolition plan and
said that they are considering countermeasures if Chen still refuses
to back down.</P>
      <P>The opposition lawmakers blasted Chen and the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party for intending to scrap the NUC and said they will
initiate a resolution condemning Chen's scheme to promote de-jure
Taiwan independence through dissolving the NUC, hurting Taiwan-U.S.
relations and undermining Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>They asked the Taiwan people to protest against the government
for its cold-shouldering of mainstream public opinion to maintain the
cross-Taiwan Strait status quo. Taiwan's representative to the United
States, David Lee, and National Security Council Secretary-General
Chiou I-jen will be asked to brief the lawmakers at the Legislative
Yuan about the latest developments in bilateral ties, they added.</P>
      <P>According to Tseng, they have fully exchanged opinions about the
NUC issue and have vowed to team up to boycott Chen in the
Legislative Yuan through concerted actions. "No possible measures
will be ruled out to serve that end, " he said, pointing out that
adjourning the current legislative session indefinitely and booting
out Chen from the presidency will be included among possible measures
to be taken.</P>
      <P>Tseng called on Chen not to abrogate the NUC and said that
whether the opposition will initiate a boycott against Chen depends
on the president's final decision.</P>
      <P>Lu called the NUC and its guidelines a "firewall" in cross-strait
relations and lashed out at Chen for leading Taiwan to the edge of a
precipice by seeking to do away with the NUC.</P>
      <P>Tsai reminded the president that his "five noes" guarantees --
one of which is not to abolish the NUC and its guidelines -- made in
his 2000 and 2004 inaugural speeches are a promise to the
international community and the Taiwan people and that it must not be
ditched.</P>
      <P>However, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Thursday
that he does not expect to see the present legislative session
stopped indefinitely.</P>

(By Debby Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Institute of Cancer Research under the
National Health Research Institutes (NHRI) announced Friday that it
will begin three clinical experiments, including using herbal
medicine, fortifying anti-tumor immunity and personalizing treatment,
to improve cancer treatment.</P>
      <P>For the herbal medicine treatment, the institute will try the new
PHY906 botanical drug, consisting of traditional herbal medicines, on
liver cancer patients. The project is expected to start within the
next two months. The institute also plans to use the drug on
colorectal cancer patients at a later stage.</P>
      <P>"The drug is mainly to help reduce the side effects of
chemotherapy and further enhance the therapy, " according to the
institute's attending physician, Shiah Her-shyong.</P>
      <P>For the anti-tumor immunity experiment, the institute's associate
investigator Liu Ko-jiunn is doing a study on terminal colorectal
cancer patients, extracting dendritic cells and cancer cells from
patients, incubating them to identify the cancer cells and then
injecting the dendritic cells back into the patients to improve their
immune systems.</P>
      <P>"Hopefully in the future we will use this method on cancer
patients who have just undergone surgery to reduce the recurrence of
cancer or extend the time before recurrence," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the institute's assistant investigator, Jacqueline
Liu, is working on personalized treatment for breast cancer patients,
using tumor markers together with assessment of individual conditions
to decide on the best treatment for each patient.</P>
      <P>The NHRI is a non-profit foundation founded by the Taiwan
government and is dedicated to the enhancement of medical research
and the improvement of health care in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>An average of 2.4 violent crimes out of

was the lowest of its kind among the cities and counties in Taiwan,
the Taipei City Police Office reported Friday. </P>

      <P>In terms of juvenile crime, five delinquents were arrested in
January in Taipei for drug-related offenses, while nine people were
arrested for copyright violation. Compared with the same month of
last year, the number of teenage offenders grew. </P>
      <P>According to city police officers involved in juvenile affairs,
most teenagers commit crimes due to ignorance of the law, so it is

    <TEXT>
      <P>National Defense Minister Lee Jye denied
media speculation Friday that China's People's Liberation Army is
(PLA) increasing its combat readiness to intimidate Taiwan as a
result of President Chen Shui-bian's plan to abolish the National
Unification Council.</P>
      <P>Answering questions at an interpellation session in the
Legislative Yuan, Lee said that incoming military intelligence about
China is analyzed at the intelligence center of the Ministry of
National Defense (MND) on a daily basis and that so far there has
been no unusual movement by Chinese military forces.</P>
      <P>"Everything has been business as usual so far, " Lee said, adding
that the guided missiles deployed on China's eastern coast remain in
their usual positions, while Chinese fighter planes are showing no
abnormally frequent take-offs and landings.</P>
      <P>On a separate occasion, ministry spokesman Liu Chih-chien denied
media reports that the military will send an extra 20,000 infantry
troops to Taipei to prevent the PLA from executing a "decapitation"
operation.</P>
      <P>In his Lunar New Year's address, Chen declared his intention to
abolish the National Unification Council and the National Unification
Guidelines, a move that was later endorsed by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>Chen has refused to back down, despite U.S. pressure and warnings
by the Bush administration about the possible consequences of his
actions.</P>

China and cause the tension to soar between the two sides of the

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATOR PUSHES FOR FURTHER REDUCTION IN ABSCONDING RATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition lawmaker said Friday that
there is still room for reduction in the rate of absconding by
Chinese people coming to Taiwan as tourists, even though a Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) report said the rate is low.</P>
      <P>David Huang, a TSU caucus whip in the Legislative Yuan, was
responding to a report by MAC Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun to the party
on cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Liu reported that since Taiwan was first opened to tourists from
China in January 2002, more than 94,000 had visited as of January, of
whom only 103, or 0.11 percent, have overstayed illegally.</P>
      <P>Liu said that compared with South Korea, which saw a Chinese
tourist absconding rate of up to 11.6 percent, Taiwan's security
checks are trustworthy.</P>
      <P>But Huang questioned the figures provided by the MAC, noting that
Taiwan has yet fully open to all Chinese citizens and claiming that
those who are allowed to come are "mostly" professionals, so the
absconding rate is naturally lower than that in South Korea, which
imposes no restrictions on which Chinese citizens can visit.</P>
      <P>"The MAC should think if it can maintain the current level when
the door to all Chinese is fully opened," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan first allowed Chinese citizens with permanent foreign
residency or Chinese students studying aboard to make pleasure trips
to Taiwan in January 2002. It later also opened to Chinese returning
to China from overseas trips, and to Chinese who have resided in Hong
Kong or Macau for more than four years and who have obtained work
permits there.</P>

to an Israeli elementary school to assist its pupils in creating the
world's largest book, which they hope will be listed in the Guinness
Book of World Records, a Presidential Office spokesman said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen received a letter from the Karkur Elementary School in
Israel late last year saying that the school's sixth graders were
compiling a book featuring blessings for children from the leaders of
various countries around the world.</P>
      <P>The book will be presented to the United Nations
secretary-general for delivery to the Guinness World Records
headquarters in London to arouse more public heed and concern for the
well-being of children.</P>
      <P>In his letter to the Israeli schoolchildren, Chen commended their
concern for public interest and community service. He also encouraged
them to continue spreading love and care to every corner of the
world.</P>
      <P>Noting that language and distance should never encumber

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Friday it welcomes an
opposition proposal to invite President Chen Shui-bian to address
lawmakers on his plan to scrap the National Unification Council
(NUC).</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-jun, a DPP legislative caucus whip, said the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First
Party (PFP), which controls a slim majority in the Legislative Yuan,
once blocked the DPP's plan to invite President Chen to deliver a
state-of-the-nation report on the legislative floor.</P>
      <P>"This time around, we hope that the opposition alliance will live
up to its words and refrain from boycotting the president's report, "
Chen said. "We believe the president's report will help opposition
lawmakers better understand his efforts at underscoring Taiwan's
unique national identity and protecting Taiwan's sovereignty."</P>
      <P>Claiming that most of the public maintain that Taiwan is an
independent and sovereign state and are opposed to eventual
unification with China as the ultimate goal set by the NUC, Chen
argued that a proposed indefinite adjournment of the current
legislative session by the opposition goes against expectations of
the public.</P>
      <P>The DPP supports President Chen's NUC abolition plan because the
body's existence would deny the people of Taiwan independence as an
option.</P>
      <P>The opposition has threatened to indefinitely adjourn the
legislative session should Chen fail to back down from his plan to
abolish the NUC and its guidelines.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China has continued to harp on an old tune
and maintains a rigid attitude in its Taiwan policy, the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Friday.</P>
      <P>The MAC was responding to Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office under
the State Council, which reaffirmed earlier in the day that if Taiwan
scraps the National Unification Council and the National Unification
Guidelines as proposed by President Chen Shui-bian Jan. 29, it will
seriously undermine cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>The NUC and the policy guidelines are purely symbolic, designed
to show that the country will not move toward de jure independence,
which Beijing has vowed to stop by force.</P>
      <P>The MAC said that China has continued to step up military
deployment against Taiwan and to obstruct Taiwan internationally. It
also enacted the anti-secession law in March 2005 to lay a legal
basis for use of force against Taiwan should China decide it is
moving toward formal independence.</P>
      <P>"The high-handed approach of China is the biggest obstacle to the
development of cross-strait relations and the root of the undermined
cross-strait relations, which is not covered up by its claim that it
wants to promote bona fide cross-strait exchanges," the MAC said.</P>
      <P>On Beijing's claim that the scrapping of the NUC is a dangerous
signal of a Taiwan move toward independence, MAC Vice Chairman Liu
Te-shun said the anti-secession law is "really the key perpetrator in
the killing of the Republic of China."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Political confrontation is escalating in
Taiwan's legislature as a result of President Chen Shui-bian's plan
to scrap the National Unification Council, with neither the ruling
party nor opposition parties willing to back down on their demands.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucuses of the opposition alliance of the
Kuomintang, the People First Party and the Non-Partisan Solidarity
Union urged the president Friday to heed the mainstream public
opinion and abandon his plan to push for the abolishment of the
National Unification Council and the National Unification Guidelines.</P>
      <P>Otherwise, they warned, the alliance of the three opposition
legislative caucuses would do whatever necessary to counter the move,
including introducing a resolution to condemn the president, calling
for an indefinite adjournment of the current legislative session,
demanding a recall of the president, or proposing a referendum on the
issue.</P>
      <P>The three opposition caucuses jointly hold 119 seats in the
220-seat legislature.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yi-jin, a legislative caucus whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), said that if the opposition caucuses take
action to recall the president or cause the collapse of the Cabinet,
the nation must hold new elections which would be tantamount to a
referendum on the issue of Taiwan's independence versus unification
with China.</P>
      <P>She warned that such a result would further alienate the 23
million Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>Yeh added that if the three opposition caucuses do introduce
resolutions to condemn the president and suspend the legislative
session indefinitely, the DPP caucus would oppose the moves and then
let the resolutions enter the required four-month negotiation period.</P>
      <P>She asked the opposition parties to think carefully before taking
these "irrational" countermeasures.</P>
      <P>DPP legislator Lee Wen-chung claimed that abolishing the NUC was
not the same as a declaration of Taiwan's independence. He warned the
three opposition parties that if they keep raising the stakes in
their confrontation with the DPP, they might end up as the losers.</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu urged the
Legislative Yuan Friday to review the laws related to the
build-operate-transfer (BOT) model for major public infrastructure
construction projects.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks after a private supervisory alliance she
heads unveiled a report regarding a number of accidents that have
occurred in the mass rapid transit (MRT) system project in Kaohsiung,
southern Taiwan, including several technical errors and alleged
kickback scandals involving government officials.</P>
      <P>The alliance, formed last year by engineering and transportation
experts, academics and lawyers, is aimed at ensuring the quality and
safety of the Kaohsiung MRT, which is still under construction.</P>
      <P>Lu questioned why the BOT model was adopted for the Kaohsiung MRT
now that the government has provided 80 percent of the needed capital
in the project.</P>
      <P>According to BOT practice, private investors receive a franchise
from the government to finance, design, construct and operate a
facility for a specific period of time before turning it over to the
government.</P>
      <P>The fact that the government, though offering 80 percent of the
capital, has no legal power to supervise the construction project is
the largest defect in the project, Lu claimed.</P>
      <P>She urged the government to conclude its investigations into all
the accidents that have occurred in the project and possible
irregularities, which she said have caused a negative image for the
Democratic Progressive Party government.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  24 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Financial Supervisory
Commission (FSC) said Friday that those who cannot repay their credit
card debts should face up to their responsibilities as soon as
possible.</P>
      <P>There have been increasing news reports of suicides and robberies
motivated by the heavy pressure to repay credit card debt, with a
report disclosing that 400,000 people around the country live as
"slaves to credit card debt, " carrying combined debts totalling over
NT$800 billion (US$24.67 billion).</P>
      <P>Because of this, the FSC set up 20 hotlines Thursday for debtors
in an effort to help them find a way out of their financial straits,
FSC officials said.</P>
      <P>A total of 403 calls were made on the hotlines that day alone,
226 of which were requests for information about a debt negotiation
mechanism that was established Dec. 15 last year to deal with the
issue, while 147 calls were reports on problems with negotiation with
banks on card debts.</P>
      <P>According to the Teacher Chang Foundation analysis, job losses,
failed investments and bearing the debts of family members or friends
are the leading reasons leading to credit card debts.</P>
      <P>Mentioning that some television talk show hosts have proposed
that card debtors should refuse to make repayments as a protest
against "malfunctioning" of the country's financial supervisory
system, under which financial institutions are allowed to issue
credit cards irresponsibly and hire gangsters to collect card debts
through threats and intimidation, the officials noted that not only
the rights of borrowers but also those of lenders should be
protected, and they urged debtors face their problems responsibly.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A love of running, the travel and always
looking for a challenge are reasons why Roy Pirrung has found himself
in every 24-hour and 100km ultramarathon he could enter -- and he
doesn't mind being considered a madman for it.</P>
      <P>"People do call me crazy. But when you love running so much you
could run forever," said Pirrung, 57, who has completed 72 marathons,
116 ultramarathons and won 12 world championship medals in his
25-year running career.</P>
      <P>"To be a good ultramarathon runner, it takes dedication and
motivation," said Pirrung, who didn't start running until the age of

      <P>"My fellow runner challenged me to go farther. And I found I was
good at it," he said.</P>

and began running, " said the Sheboygan, Wisconsin native, now 130
pounds.</P>
      <P>Travelling was the icing on the cake when he took up running --
in numerous countries including France, Argentina, The Czech Republic
and Taiwan. Pirrung is now on his second trip to Taiwan, where he won
the gold medal for the 55-59 age group in the 2003 World Masters
Athletics 100km marathon in the southern city of Tainan.</P>
      <P>Speaking on why ultrarunners are relatively older compared to
other running events, Pirrung said: "As you get older, you lose your
speed. You don't run as fast. But you still love it [running]."</P>
      <P>Older runners try to challenge themselves in a different way,
which is why there are a lot more older runners in ultramarathons, he
added.</P>
      <P>"I even enjoy running for 48 hours," Pirrung said. "A lot of
things ran through my mind when I was running -- religion, family,
politics ... everything. Your body frees up your mind."</P>
      <P>Pirrung, a newspaper columnist for the Sheboygan Press, has a
personal best of 248km in the 24-hour marathon and hopes to finish
240km in Taiwan this weekend.</P>
      <P>He was elected into the USA Track and Field Masters Hall of Fame
in 2001 and named USATF Masters Ultrarunner of the Year in 2002.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday patience
is needed in dealing with issues regarding name changes for public
establishments that carry the name of the late President Chiang
Kai-shek.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks while fielding questions from ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Trong Chai, who
demanded that the government tear down statues of Chiang or alter the
name of public facilities that bear his name, such as Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport and Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, among many
others.</P>
      <P>Su called for patience as name changes of some organizations or
buildings must be made in line with the law and avoid unnecessary
controversies.</P>
      <P>"We will try as much as we can, but the matter will take time as
some laws need to be amended by the Legislative Yuan, " he said,
without elaboration.</P>
      <P>Chai's demand came after a report made public last week by a
private research group suggests that Chiang was the prime culprit of
the 228 Incident of 1947, in which thousands of the Taiwanese
intellectual elite were killed by KMT troops. Chiang was also then
KMT chairman.</P>

After a day of violence so raw and so

were stunned. Everything felt different on

Wall Street Journal: Credit Dispute, How
Academic Flap Hurt World Effort On Chinese
Bird Flu

China's efforts to maintain control over
samples of avian flu taken on its soil, as
well as the research done on them, have put it
at odds with international health officials
trying to defeat the disease. In Beijing, 
officials from the World Health Organization and
the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organiz
ation asked Dr. Jia Youling, a high-ranking
veterinarian in China's Ministry of Agriculture,
to share with them the samples of bird flu that 
scientists under his ministry had collected from
the birds. He didn't provide them. Since that
meeting, China hasn't provided a single
sample from its infected flocks, despite
repeated requests by WHO amid the roughly 30
outbreaks the country has reported in the past
12 months. The genetic information contained in 
China's samples could help develop a more
effective vaccine that could save countless

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian extended a hearty
welcome Friday to the arrival of Chilean House of Representatives
Speaker Gabriel Ascencio Mansilla, the first Chilean congressional
leader to visit Taiwan since a diplomatic breakup in 1970.</P>
      <P>During a meeting at the Presidential Office, Chen said it's a
great pleasure for him to receive Ascencio in Taipei and exchange
views on measures to expand bilateral trade and cooperation.</P>
      <P>Chen said he is moved by the fact that Ascencio is visiting
Taiwan as the Chilean House speaker. It marked the first time that a
Chilean House speaker has visited Taiwan in his official capacity
since the two countries severed diplomatic ties 36 years ago, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Despite geographic distance, Chen said, two-way trade between
Taiwan and Chile has been growing steadily. In 2005, Taiwan-Chilean
trade exceeded US$1.5 billion, with Chile enjoying a US$1 billion
trade surplus.</P>
      <P>"It is hoped that increased trade, coupled with Ascencio's
current visit, will contribute to further growth in bilateral
economic cooperation and civilian exchanges," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen also said he admires Chilean people's recent election of
Mihelle Bachelet as their new president. Bachelet is Chile's first
female president in the country's 195-year history.</P>
      <P>Noting that both Taiwan and Chile have evolved from authoritarian
rule to democracy, Chen said he is hopeful that the two countries
will expand cooperation in various fields based their shared values
in freedom, democracy and human rights.</P>
      <P>For his part, Ascencio said that despite the absence of formal
diplomatic ties, there should still be ample room for bilateral
relations to grow and upgrade, particularly in scientific,
technological, commercial and cultural fields.</P>

      <P>Two-way trade between Taiwan and China
reached US$71.7 billion in 2005, with Taiwan enjoying a trade surplus
of US$31.8 billion, a year-on-year increase of 12.6 percent, the
Board of Foreign Trade (BOFA) reported Friday.</P>
      <P>The bilateral trade posted a growth of 16.3 percent over the
previous year, which -- along with the 12.6 percent in Taiwan's trade
surplus with China -- were both the slowest rates of growth since
2002, BOFA officials said.</P>
      <P>Last year, Taiwan's trade with China accounted for 19.3 percent
of its entire foreign trade, up 1.3 percentage points from 2004.
Taiwan's exports to China hit US$51.77 billion in that year, a
year-on-year growth of 15.2 percent, while imports from China
amounted to US$19.93 billion, an increase of 19.5 percent, according

imported goods worth US$74.66 billion from Taiwan that year, a
year-on-year growth of 15.3 percent. The growth rate, however, was
lower than the country's general import growth rate of 17.7 percent.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports to China accounted for 11.31 percent of total

    <TEXT>
      <P>Forty-five lawmakers, mainly from the
pro-unification opposition camp, have endorsed a proposal to recall
President Chen Shui-bian, the proposal's initiator said Friday.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Ting Shou-chung said he
came up with the proposal to recall Chen after the president
delivered a New Year's Day address which pushed for more effective
management of China-bound investment.</P>
      <P>Since Jan. 4, Ting said, 45 of his legislative colleagues have
signed on to the proposal. Ting said many of them had thrown their
support behind the measure after Chen's Jan. 29 New Year's address,
in which he mentioned a plan to abolish the National Unification
Council (NUC) and the National Unification Guidelines.</P>
      <P>Ting said he hoped at least 10 more lawmakers would step forward
to support the proposal, so it could become a bill and open for
debate in the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>According to the Constitution, any proposal to recall the
president or vice president must first have the endorsement of
one-fourth of all legislators. As the legislature currently has
220 members, Ting's proposal must get the support of at least 55
lawmakers.</P>
      <P>The passage of the proposal to recall the president needs the
support of two-thirds of all lawmakers, which must then be put for a
public referendum.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's energy consumption amounted to
162.3 million kiloliters of crude oil equivalent (KLOE) in 2005, up
3.2 percent over the year-earlier level, according to a report
released Saturday by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting
and Statistics.</P>
      <P>Energy supplies amounted to 135.5 million KLOE last year, up 1

energy supplies were imported, more than half of which was in the
form of oil and related products.</P>
      <P>Of the energy consumed, 54.59 million KLOE were in the form of
electricity, up 4.7 percent from the previous year, and 41.46 million
KLOE were in the form of oil products, up 2.4 percent year-on-year.
The two items together accounted for more than 90 percent of all

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN AQUACULTURE BUSINESS GROUP TO VISIT SOUTH ASIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 25 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As part of efforts to help expand Taiwan's
aquaculture industry overseas, the semi-official Taiwan External
Trade Development Council (TAITRA) will organize a visit by an
aquaculture business delegation to South Asia in May aimed at
studying the investment climate there, council officials said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>In the preliminary plan, the officials said, local aquaculture
operators and manufacturers of peripherals for the industry are
welcome to join the group on a visit to India's Chennai and
Bangladesh's Dhaka from May 14-24</P>
      <P>During the visit, the delegation will hold industrial forums with
local counterparts and manufacturers in an effort to ascertain the
state of aquaculture development in the two countries, as well as
trading opportunities. Efforts will also be made to build links with
local business organizations in the sector, TAITRA officials said.</P>
      <P>The aquaculture sector has become more and more important as
marine fishery resources are shrinking significantly as a result of
overfishing. Benefiting from warm weather and geographic advantages,
the South Asian area along the Bay of Bangladesh has developed into a
global center of the aquaculture industry.</P>
      <P>India is the second-largest inland aquaculture operator in the
world, with around 2.25 million hectares of land fit for the
establishment of commercial fish farms, while Bangladesh is also
listed in the world's top 10 exporters of shrimp bred in captivity,
according to the TAITRA.</P>
      <P>With advanced and mature technology in the field, including whole
plant design and manufacturing of relevant equipment and feed,
Taiwan's aquaculture industry should seek opportunities overseas in
order to grab global market share, TAITRA said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHIEF DOES NOT APOLOGIZE FOR 228 INCIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  25 (CNA)
(By Debby Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou said Saturday that the KMT is "not without responsibility"
for the 228 Incident, but he did not offer an apology during a
memorial ceremony held by the KMT.</P>
      <P>The ceremony to mark the 59th anniversary of the 228 Incident at
Taipei's 228 Memorial Park was attended by both party officials and
invited families of the victims. Ma said the theme of the ceremony
was "reflect humbly, hold a sincere dialogue, and keep the promise."</P>
      <P>"It was the government that made decision regarding the 228
Incident, not the KMT. Yet the KMT was the governing party, so we
cannot say that the KMT was not responsible," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma pointed out that the 228 Incident was not a conflict between
different ethnic groups but was the result of the KMT's oppression of
the people.</P>
      <P>"To prevent it from happening again, the government needs to
avoid corruption and it should solve the people's complaints, " Ma
said. The KMT was thrown out of power by the Democratic Progressive
Party in 2000.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that it was the first time the KMT had held a ceremony
in front of the 228 Memorial and said the party invited the families
of victims to attend. He described it as a very important and
meaningful event for the victims, their families and the KMT.</P>
      <P>"This is an important first step in my promotion of
reconciliation," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Yet Ma did not offer an apology to the victims and their families
at the ceremony. Asked why he did not apologize, he said: "I did so
many times in the past."</P>
      <P>His failure to apologize, however, made some of the families
unhappy.</P>
      <P>"He did not apologize. He showed no sincerity, " Chang Liang-tze
said. Chang's father was jailed for about a year following the
incident, and his family's assets were confiscated by the KMT.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident started Feb. 28, 1947 under then-President
Chiang Kai-shek's administration. It was sparked by a skirmish in
which Monopoly Bureau officials attempts to confiscate untaxed
cigarettes led to the injury of a female vendor and the death of an
innocent bystander, prompting mass demonstrations and clashes all
over Taiwan between local Taiwanese and those who had come from
China. Chiang ordered troops from China to move into Taiwan March 8,
beginning a brutal crackdown that resulted in the deaths of some
30,000 people.</P>
      <P>KMT vice chairmen Wu Po-hsiung and P.K. Chiang were both present
at Saturday's ceremony, as was Chiang Kai-shek's grandson, KMT
Legislator John Chiang. Chiang's arrival created some turmoil as some
families of the victims wanted him expelled from the ceremony, but
were restrained by others.</P>
      <P>There were also some families of the victims who expressed hope
that Ma will change the KMT.</P>
      <P>"If my presence here today at the ceremony can arouse the KMT to
reform completely and become a real Taiwan local party, and work
together with other parties in this beautiful island nation to build
a country where the people can enjoy permanent peace and happiness...
this would be something our ancestors would have loved to see, " said
Chang An-man in an address to the crowd. Chang's grandfather, father,
and uncle were all killed in the incident.</P>

      <P>County and city governments nationwide are

preventing bird flu, which include requiring poultry farmers to raise
chickens indoors instead of free-range between September and April,
Council of Agriculture officials said Saturday.</P>

season when migratory birds are on the move and that keeping chickens
outside will increase the opportunity of their having contact with
migratory birds -- potential carriers of the bird flu virus.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA TO STOP FMD VACCINATION OF HOGS ON PENGHU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) said
Saturday that it will stop vaccinating hogs on the outlying island of
Penghu against foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) on a trial basis from
March 1.</P>
      <P>If all goes well, FMD shots for hogs on Taiwan proper will
be stopped from June, COA officials said.</P>
      <P>If no fresh FMD cases are reported after one year of stopping
vaccinations, Taiwan will apply to the France-based animal health
organization The Office Internationale Des Epizooties (OIE) to
reinstate the island as an FMD-free country.</P>
      <P>A major FMD epidemic in March 1997 prompted the government to
order a mass slaughter of hogs. In 1999, cattle on the outlying
island of Kinmen were found to be infected with FMD. No cases have
been reported since February 2001, and Taiwan applied to the OIE to
be delisted as an FMD-affected country in 2003.</P>
      <P>International animal quarantine regulations require a country to
pass a two-stage test before it can apply to be listed as
disease-free. The first stage is to have a vaccination program up and
running for a full two years, with no new cases reported.</P>
      <P>In the second stage, the country stops the vaccination program
and if there are no new cases for a full year after that, it can
apply to be declared FMD-free.</P>
      <P>With persistent efforts in fighting the disease over the past two
or three years, as well as a comprehensive vaccination program, the
COA is hoping that Taiwan will soon be listed FMD-free.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXPERTS TRY TO BALANCE AIRPORT SAFETY WITH PRESS FREEDOM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 25 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several police and press representatives as
well as scholars met Saturday for a seminar on airport safety and
press freedom after the government announced a plan to cancel from
March permanent press cards with which journalists can enter
controlled areas at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport.</P>
      <P>The seminar was organized by opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
Legislator Chen Yin-ho at the Legislative Yuan, with many law
enforcement and press representatives participating, including Hu
Ya-ping, deputy director of the Aviation Police Office under the
National Police Administration, Hsieh Li-kung, director of the
Department of Border Police at Central Police University, Lu
Shih-hsiang, chief executive of the Foundation for the Advancement of
Media Excellence and Lu Tung-hsi, chairman of the Association of
Taiwan Journalists.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Lee Yi-yang announced the plan several days
ago, saying that the decision was made to maintain order and safety
at the airport and prevent unnecessary exposure of government
officials' secret visits abroad, as well as foreign political
figures' unannounced visits to Taiwan, and to avoid bothering
passengers.</P>
      <P>From March 1, reporters will need to apply for a press pass in
advance before they can enter controlled areas at the airport, a
process that will be handled on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>The new policy has drawn strong protests from journalists
stationed there, who claim it will restrict press freedom.</P>
      <P>However, Hu noted at the seminar that the results of an online
survey conducted by Yahoo Taiwan show that 55 percent of the
respondents oppose permanent stationing of journalists at CKS
Airport, as they cause chaos when they chase public figures, be they
politicians, movie stars or criminals.</P>
      <P>Hu said that in principle, specific controlled areas at the
airport will not be open to reporters, but he said he supports news
coverage on certain conditions, such as government leaders' open
visits abroad, charter flight services between the two sides of
Taiwan Strait, or quarantine measures at the airport, which he said
involve the public interest.</P>
      <P>Noting that journalists are not necessarily allowed free access
to crime scenes, Hsieh said there should be similar restrictions at
the airport.</P>
      <P>Lu, who has been promoting progress for the media, said that
journalists who are reluctant to accept certain limitations will not
earn the respect of the public, adding that the problem can be
resolved through more communications between the media and the law
enforcement agencies.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the airport press club issued a statement, saying that
the government should not invalidate their permanent press cards
unless their news coverage will impair national security. They
expressed hope that the Aviation Police Office can make a list of
which items cannot be covered.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Aviation Police Office's responsibility is only
to maintain order at the airport, Hu said they will not harass
reporters and added that they will accept suggestions by the experts
to improve communications with the journalists.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Consumers' Foundation asked the Taiwan
Area National Expressway Bureau Saturday to accept a court ruling and
start to plan a more reasonable electronic toll collection (ETC)
system.</P>
      <P>Foundation officials were responding to a ruling by the Taipei
High Administrative Court Friday that the screening process by the
bureau under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
violated the principles of public interest and equality and that the
Far Eastern Electronic Toll Collection Co. (FETC), the priority
applicant status of the ETC system, a subsidiary of the Far Eastern
Group, should be revoked.</P>
      <P>Yutung Information Technology Co., the second priority applicant,
filed the suit against the bureau.</P>
      <P>The ruling threw the fate of the two-week-old ETC system into
limbo and marked the first case of a priority applicant that has
already carried out a build-operate-transfer (BOT) project to have
its status revoked since BOT projects were implemented.</P>
      <P>Chen Jen-hung, vice chairman of the Consumers' Foundation, noted
that a deluge of criticism about the ETC system, including the high
price of installing on-board units (OBUs) in cars, not enough outlets
offering stored value cards, and traffic violations because of the
short driver education campaign period, is primarily because the
consideration between the government and the operator has been to
protect business interests.</P>
      <P>He urged the bureau to stop seeking an appeal so that all
disputes can be put to rest and a more reasonable ETC system devised.
The bureau should also instruct the FETC to refund drivers who have
installed the equipment.</P>
      <P>He also urged those who have yet to install the OBUs to refrain
from doing so, as the government might have to re-start the bidding
process for the system, and the operation mode, as well as the
specifications of the OBU equipment, are not yet certain.</P>
      <P>Minister of Transportation and Communications Kuo Yao-cho refused
to comment on the ETC ruling Saturday, saying only that the judicial
authorities will investigate whether irregularities were involved in
the screening process of the bidding to operate the ETC system.</P>
      <P>Far Eastern Group Chairman Douglas Hsu said Saturday that he
regretted the court ruling and that he will await the government's
decision on the ETC system.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that the FETC emerged as the priority applicant during a
"fair and just" screening process sponsored by the Taiwan Area
National Expressway Bureau.</P>
      <P>The government should be more transparent about the screening
process, he added.</P>
      <P>He said the FETC made a great deal of effort to win the BOT
project. More than 70,000 cars have OBUs installed, at the owners'
expense, and more than 100,000 vehicles have registered to install
the units.</P>
      <P>Both Hsu and Kuo made the remarks on the sidelines of a memorial
service for the late Premier Sun Yun-suan Saturday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT PAYS TRIBUTE TO DEDICATED AMERICAN NURSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian traveled to the
outlying island of Penghu Saturday to pay tribute to and express
appreciation for an ailing American nurse who has dedicated her life
to serving the Taiwan people, particularly leprosy patients, for
several decades.</P>
      <P>Chen visited the government-run Penghu Hospital to extend his
regards and concern for Bly Marjorie Ingeleiv, an 87-year-old public
health nurse from the state of Missouri, who has been hospitalized
and is in poor health.</P>
      <P>Praising Ingeleiv as a spark of light in the darkness, Chen said
Ingeleiv's loving heart and longstanding services for the Taiwan
people are moving and memorable.</P>
      <P>Chen directed the Penghu county government to make preparation to
build a statute to commemorate her legacy.</P>
      <P>Ingeleiv, better known locally by her Chinese name Pai Pao-chu,
came to Taiwan in late 1952. She first worked at a sanctuary on the
outskirts of Taipei, caring for leprosy patients. As many of her most
serious cases came from Penghu, she decided in 1953 to move to the
outlying island county so that she could help diagnose patients as
early as possible and raise public awareness of the disease.</P>
      <P>In the early 1950s, Taiwan was still an agrarian backwater with
limited medical resources, particularly in Penghu, home to a
windswept fishing community. Besides offering medical services at the
government-run Penghu Hospital, Ingeleiv often made housecalls to
offer tips on public health as well as on the prevention and
treatment of leprosy traveling all over Penghu and its smaller
outlying islets. Her devotion, perseverance and loving heart earned
her enormous gratitude and respect from Penghu residents.</P>
      <P>Ingeleiv once said she considered Penghu as her "second hometown"
after living and working in the county for five decades. In Penghu,
she is a household name. Even after her retirement a decade ago, she
continued to concern herself with the county's medical service
quality.</P>
      <P>She has received many honors for her outstanding selfless
services for local people, including honorary citizenship of Penghu
and a national medical services award. She was granted permanent
residency in Taiwan in 2002. Because of her deep love for Penghu, she
said she has never planned to return to the United States.</P>

Saturday that a ban on the sale of three batches of pork ribs
imported earlier this year from the Netherlands had been lifted after
tests showed that the produce did not contain excess amounts of
dioxin as had been previously suspected.</P>
      <P>The DOH posted a notice about the lifting of the ban on its
official Web site late Friday.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the DOH said a ban on imports of Dutch pork and pig
viscera imposed Feb. 3 remains valid pending further evaluation
reports from the Dutch authorities about risks of dioxin
contamination.</P>
      <P>Tests on samples from the three batches of Dutch pork banned by
Miaoli and Taichung health authorities, respectively, early this
month showed that the concentration of dioxins were 0.041 pg TEQ/1g
fat, 0.072 pg TEQ/1g fat and 0.07pg TEQ/1g fat, well below the
permitted maximums set in the European Union dioxin control
regulations.</P>
      <P>As a result, the DOH said, the three batches of pork ribs can be
sold, effective immediately.</P>
      <P>The ban came after suspected cases of pig and chicken dioxin
poisoning were reported in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium late
last month.</P>
      <P>Taiwan did not import chicken from the three countries and only
imported pork from the Netherlands.</P>
      <P>The three European countries had isolated over 650 farms
suspected of using dioxin-contaminated feed made in Belgium and the
Netherlands shut down some 260 farms for inspection and quarantine.</P>
      <P>A Belgian government food safety official said early this month
that faulty filters at a chemical plant caused abnormal levels of
dioxin to reach animal feed, but claimed that there was no immediate
danger to human health.</P>
      <P>Dioxin, a by-product of garbage burning and industrial
activities, can cause a range of illnesses in humans, including
cancer, metabolic malfunction and miscarriage.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although none of them are ranked in the
world top 50, Taiwanese marathoners still had high hopes on the eve
of the 2006 24-hour World Challenge and believed the warmer weather
would be an advantage for Taiwanese runners.</P>
      <P>"The weather has been getting warmer in the past two days. I
believe it will be an advantage for us, " said 45-year-old Wu
Sheng-ming, who set his goal for the competition at 240 km, 14 km
more than his personal best.</P>
      <P>Last year in the Soochow 24-hour marathon, which was also held in
Taipei, the temperature dropped to as low as three degrees Celsius,
which hurt the performance of local runners, Wu said.</P>
      <P>More than 200 runners from 23 countries were participating in the
24-hour marathon, which began in the Yuan Shan park Saturday.</P>
      <P>Not every runner is as ambitious as Wu. Yang Hsin-fu, 60, said he
would be satisfied to break his personal best of 184 km.</P>
      <P>"The most gratifying moment for me in the 24-hour marathon is
seeing the sun come up. It's worth everything, " said Yang Mei-lian,
who entered the event against her son's wishes.</P>
      <P>"My son, a medical college student, thinks the marathon is not
good for my health, " Yang said, adding that she will be proud to
finish the run.</P>
      <P>The key to running for 24 hours, Wu said, is to take the proper
nutrition supplements at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P>"As the host team, we will do our best. Hopefully we will not let
the local fans down, " Wu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO CROSS-STRAIT CONSENSUS STRUCK IN 1992: NEW AIT CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb. 25 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>New American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
Chairman Raymond F. Burghardt might be the only American political
figure who has ever expressed his opinion in public about the
question whether the two sides of the Taiwan Strait struck a
consensus during their talks in Hong Kong in 1992, usually
abbreviated to "92 Consensus."</P>
      <P>Burghardt, who headed the Taipei office of the AIT, a
quasi-official organization that handles Taiwan-U.S. affairs in the
absence of diplomatic ties, from 1999 through 2001, once said in a
speech delivered at a farewell party hosted by the American Chamber
of Commerce in Taipei (AmCham) that he personally doesn't believe in
the so-called "92 Consensus."</P>
      <P>The "92 Consensus" was said to spell out that while China and
Taiwan agree there is "one China, " they each define the term
differently.</P>
      <P>In his Aug. 28, 2001 speech at the AmCham farewell party prior to
ending his Taipei stint, Burghardt said after their Hong Kong talks,
Taiwan and China exchanged faxes detailing their respective stances.</P>
      <P>To the best of his understanding, Burghardt said: "some language
(in their faxes) that overlapped and some language that differed."
Then Taiwan and China agreed to conduct dialogue based on their
statements written in those faxes.</P>
      <P>"That's what happened. Nothing more or nothing less, " Burghardt
said, adding that Taiwan's Kuomintang called them as "92 Consensus"
which was to some extent "confusing and misleading."</P>
      <P>"To me, I'm not sure why you could call that a consensus, "
Burghardt said.</P>
      <P>In the future, Burghardt continued that perhaps both sides will
recognize that the most important consensus reached in 1992 was that
it is in the interests of each side to engage in dialogue.</P>
      <P>Burghardt also offered his recipe for renewed cross-strait
negotiations: "If the political will were there on both sides, it
doesn't have to be that complicated. Maybe all you have to do is say
that an agreement (that talks are mutually beneficial) was reached...
in 1992 and that it remains in effect."</P>
      <P>He further warned that if the two sides failed to resume dialogue
before Jiang Zemin stepped down from the Chinese presidency, the
prospects for resumption of cross-strait dialogue would be even
gloomier under the new Chinese leadership. Jiang stepped down from
the presidency in 2003 and relinquished his control of the military
and faded into retirement in 2005.</P>
      <P>Burghardt, currently director of East-West Seminars at the
East-West Center in Honolulu, will continue to hold his Honolulu
position while concurrently serving as AIT chairman.</P>
      <P>Burghardt has previously served as U.S. ambassador to Vietnam,
director of the AIT Taipei Office, American consul general in
Shanghai and deputy chief of mission at the U.S. embassies in Manila
and Seoul.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOTC MAY APPEAL ETC CASE: MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  25  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) said Saturday it may appeal for a review by the
Supreme Administrative Court of the controversy surrounding a
freeway electronic toll collection (ETC) system.</P>
      <P>MOTC Minister Kuo Yao-chi made the announcement after the
ministry's Taiwan Area National Expressway Bureau (TANEB) signed an
agreement with Far Eastern Electronic Toll Collection Co. (FETC) , a
Far Eastern Group offshoot, on certain key principles for resolving
subsequent issues.</P>
      <P>According to the agreement, Kuo said the existing freeway traffic
lanes exclusively for automobiles equipped with
on-board-units (OBU) for the FETC-operated toll collection system
will remain open and FETC will continue normal operations while
the MOTC is preparing for appealing the case and during the court
proceedings.</P>
      <P>If the freeway bureau ultimately loses the case on appeal, Kuo
said, the MOTC will "fully consider the rights and interests of those
who have purchased OBUs."</P>
      <P>"Should the freeway bureau win the case, the current ETC
system will logically continue operations," Kuo said, adding that
if the bureau turns out to be a loser, the government
will have replacements in place.</P>
      <P>Kuo further said if the Supreme Administrative Court rejects the
bureau's appeal, both the top priority bidder FETC and the second
priority bidder Yutung Technology Information Co. will lose their
"priority status" and the government may open a brand new tender to
choose a "top priority bidder" to design and operate a new ETC system
under the current build-operate-transfer (BOT) formula. </P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Kuo said, the government will not rule out the
possibility to take over the FETC-built system and manage it on
its own.</P>
      <P>According to the agreement reached between FETC and freeway bureau
earlier in the day, FETC will transfer its current ETC system and all
facilities to the freeway bureau at a cost set on Feb. 24 and
will not demand any damages.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the freeway bureau was wrong in determining
FETC as the most appropriate or priority bidder, Yutung filed the
suit with the Administrative Court. The court ruled Friday that the
freeway bureau indeed made the wrong decision in choosing FETC as the
priority bidder.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VISIT BY U.S. OFFICIAL UNRELATED TO NUC ABOLITION PROPOSAL: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
Richard Armitage is scheduled to visit Taipei in the first half of
March, but his visit is unrelated to President Chen Shui-bian's
proposal to abolish the National Unification Council (NUC) , an
official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Michel Lu was
responding to a media report that Armitage will come to Taipei next
month in yet another effort by the Bush administration to persuade
Chen to retain the symbolic policy council on unification across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The U.S.-based Nelson Report, a daily briefing on international
economic policy issues, foreign and security policy matters and their
relationship to politics in Washington, said over the weekend that
Armitage will meet Chen and spell out the consequences of the
controversial NUC abolition plan and offer tips on how to settle the
dust-up.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the report is sheer speculation, Lu said that
Armitage has been invited by the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy
(TFD). He reiterated that Armitage's visit has nothing to do with the
NUC issue.</P>
      <P>Lu added that Armitage will be accompanied by Randall Schriver,
Armitage's chief of staff and a former deputy assistant secretary of
state for East Asian and Pacific affairs.</P>
      <P>Other MOFA sources said Armitage might arrive in Taipei March 8
or March 9. The duration of his visit remained uncertain, as his
itinerary has yet to be fleshed out, the sources added.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, the TFD originally planned to arrange
for Armitage to deliver a public speech during his visit, but the
plan might have to be scrapped because of what they described as
"certain factors."</P>
      <P>The sources further said that Armitage will have many private
engagements during his stay in Taipei and will also meet with Chen
and senior national security officials.</P>
      <P>Chen, keen to shake off China's claim of sovereignty over Taiwan,
said recently that the National Unification Council and the National
Unification Guidelines are "absurd products of an absurd era" and
should be scrapped. His plan has angered Beijing and alarmed
Washington.</P>
      <P>The NUC, created in 1990 when the pro-unification Kuomintang
(KMT) was in power, has been dormant since Chen took office in 2000
and ended the KMT's 55-year rule of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But if Chen abolishes the council and the guidelines, he will be
breaking a promise he made in his 2000 inauguration speeches and
underscore Beijing's suspicions that he is pushing for independence.
Beijing has vowed to attack Taiwan if the island formally declares
statehood.</P>
      <P>Unconfirmed news reports have said that Washington sent two
officials, including Dennis Wilder, a White House National Security
Council official in charge of Asian affairs, to Taiwan earlier this
month to try to persuade Chen to drop the idea but that Chen showed
no intention of changing his mind.</P>
      <P>News reports also said some U.S. officials are sympathetic to
Taiwan's plight and share Taiwan's views that China has relentlessly
challenged the cross-strait status quo and has been striving to make
"unification" the sole option for Taiwan's future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DO NOT DESTROY TAIWAN-U.S. TRUST, KMT URGES PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 26 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the Chen Shui-bian government and the
United States seemingly on a collision course with regard to Chen's
expressed intention to abolish the National Unification Council
(NUC) , opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou urged the
president Sunday not to destroy the long-standing trust between
Taiwan and the U.S.</P>
      <P>Ma called on Chen to "place the interests of the people above
personal gains" and not to adversely affect cross-Taiwan Strait
stability.</P>
      <P>In reply to media questions after presiding over the opening of
an art exhibition, Ma, who is also Taipei mayor, said he was in no
mood to make any further comments on this issue, as the powers that
be should make people's daily lives their top priority.</P>
      <P>"Whether or not to do away with the NUC and National Unification
Guidelines (NUG) will not add or deduct an ounce from people's
weights," he said.</P>
      <P>What the government should focus its attention on, he said, is
such problems as "credit card slaves" many of whom have ended up
taking extreme measures to evade their credit card debts.</P>
      <P>The People First Party (PFP), the other main opposition "pan-blue
alliance" member, urged the president to "rein in his horse before he
jumps off a cliff."</P>
      <P>PFP spokesman Hsieh Kung-ping said it is beyond doubt that both
the U.S. and China have deep suspicions about Chen's recent moves
toward abrogating the NUC and NUG, one of his "four noes plus one"
commitments to not destabilizing the cross-strait situation.</P>
      <P>Chen's expressions of his intention to do away with the NUG and
what he called "outdated and anachronistic" NUC have severely
affected Taiwan's national security and international reputation,
Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that if Chen keeps ignoring the opposition's warnings,
his party will be forced to consider the possibility of launching a
campaign to recall the president together with other like-minded
political forces.</P>
      <P>"As of now, our strategy is to ask President Chen or other
responsible officials to make a special report on the subject to the
legislature. If the request is denied, we will propose an indefinite
suspension of legislative meetings," he said.</P>
      <P>In the face of the ruling-opposition standoff, former president
Lee Teng-hui said it is not necessary to abolish the NUG and NUC.
"The government needs simply to refrain from implementing the NUG and
announce a suspension of the NUG and NUC, " he said in Kaohsiung,
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee also denied media reports that Chen followed Lee's advice to
add the "plus one" to his "four noes" policy, in which Chen pledged
that during his term as president, he will not declare Taiwan
independence, not change the national title, not push for inclusion
in the Constitution the description of cross-strait relations as
"state-to-state" and not hold a referendum on unification versus
independence.</P>
      <P>The four noes were followed by "therefore, there will not be a
problem of abolishing the NUG, " which commits Taiwan to eventual
unification with China.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) is planning to organize a large-scale parade March 18 to
underscore Taiwan's national sovereignty, one year after Beijing
implemented its Anti-Secession Law, DPP spokesman Tsai Huang-liang
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>High ranking government officials will be invited to take part in
the parade, in which the DPP and pro-independence private-sector
groups are planning to mobilize over 100,000 people to express their
objections to the law and voice their support for President Chen
Shui-bian's proposal to scrap the National Unification Council (NUC)
and its guidelines that set the stage for Taiwan's unification with
China, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that March has been chosen by the DPP as the month to
counter Beijing's suppression of Taiwan and cement Taiwan's
democracy, as Taiwan's first direct presidential election, the first
peaceful transfer of power and a historic public referendum all took
place in that month, among other major incidents.</P>
      <P>It is widely speculated that Chen might formally announce the
abolition of the NUC and its guidelines in March after he went back
on his inaugural speech promise in late January and said that he was
seriously considering scrapping the NUC and its guidelines.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT PLANS TO TAKE OVER FREEWAY ETC BUSINESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 26 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will take over the operation
of the electronic toll collection (ETC) business if it fails to
appeal an administrative court decision to revoke the eligibility of
the current contract winner, the FETC, a government spokesman said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Government Information Minister Cheng Wen-tsan made the remarks
after the Taipei High Administrative Court ruled that the priority
privilege of FETC of the Far Eastern Group to negotiate an ETC
contract with the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC) should be revoked. MOTC Minister Kuo Yao-chi said she will
appeal the ruling.</P>
      <P>In the face of mounting criticism of the government's ETC policy
debacle, Cheng said the Cabinet will explain all the shortcomings
found in the process of evaluating all contract applicants and
implementing the winning contract.</P>
      <P>"We will never try to cover up anything, neither will we be
targeting any individuals," he said.</P>
      <P>He noted that the judicial authorities are already investigating
what went wrong during the award process of the ETC contract and said
the Executive Yuan will respect the results of the investigation.</P>
      <P>As for the administrative responsibility, the MOTC has been told
to check if any negligence of duty has been committed, he added.</P>
      <P>He gave his assurance that the interests of car users who have
installed on-board units (OBUs) at their own expense will be fully
protected.</P>
      <P>Claiming that "a wrong policy is worse than corruption," the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) vowed to condemn all responsible
officials and bring them to justice.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, executive director of the KMT Central Policy
Committee, claimed that the ETC debacle is "worse than an
irregularity case" for which not only the MOTC, but also the
Executive Yuan and the whole administration are to blame.</P>
      <P>If the government does not come up with good remedial measures
soon, Tseng said the opposition alliance of the KMT, the People First
Party (PFP) and the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union will escalate their
pressure on the government in protest over its incompetence and lack
of integrity.</P>
      <P>The PFP, which forms the "pan-blue alliance" with the KMT, said
appealing the court decision is not the best solution to the problem,
which is another indication that the ruling team has once again
demonstrated it's lack of ability and integrity to rule the country.</P>
      <P>Lu Hsueh-chang, convener of the PFP legislative caucus, said the
MOTC must ensure that road users' rights will not be affected after
MOTC Minister Kuo Yao-chi announced that while her ministry appeals
the case, freeways will be run as usual and FETC can still sell OBUs
to drivers, many of who are worried about how to return already
installed OBUs and obtain refunds.</P>
      <P>Lu said that if the MOTC buys all the FETC equipment and operates
the business by itself, it will devastate the build-operate-transfer
(BOT) spirit that gives private contractors the right to build
infrastructure, operate the system and then transfer it back to the
government after a specific period of time.</P>
      <P>"The PFP caucus will not stand idly by and watch the taxpayers
being forced to pay for the government's incompetent policy, " he
said.</P>
      <P>Liu Wen-hsiung, a PFP lawmaker, urged the government not to
appeal the administrative court decision and to "stop more damage
being done" by putting a halt to the ETC business and compensating
some 60,000 car owners who have installed OBUs.</P>
      <P>He said officials must have carried out their duties rashly by
allowing an unqualified contractor to win the ETC contract.</P>
      <P>Liu said members of the contract awarding committee, officials at
the Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau and MOTC, and government
prosecutors and investigators, must be held responsible for the chaos
created by the policy debacle.</P>
      <P>On reports that FETC might demand government compensation for its
losses, Liu said it is FETC that should compensate the government.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yi-jin, legislative caucus secretary-general of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said the MOTC has not done a good
job handling the controversy.</P>
      <P>"Now it is time for the MOTC to put forward good remedial
measures, such as demanding that FETC refund OBUs owners and cutting
ETC lanes to just one at each toll station," she said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN READY TO FILE SUIT FOR RETURN OF LAFAYETTE SLUSH FUND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is ready to file a lawsuit
for the return of a huge slush fund frozen in Swiss banks that is
believed to be made up of illegal kickbacks from a Taiwan arms
procurement deal with France back in the early 1990s, judicial
authorities said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Outgoing State Public Prosecutor-General Wu Ying-chao told CNA
that a special prosecutorial panel investigating the high-profile
kickback scandal involving Taiwan's purchase of six Lafayette-class
frigates from France in 1991 has authored a 70-page report on the
kickback refund lawsuit.</P>
      <P>"The report clearly lists the individuals to be asked to refund,
the amount of kickbacks each of them has to refund and the offenses
each has committed, as well as other related matters," Wu said.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, Andrew Wang, the agent in Taiwan for
Thomson-CSF, the French company that sold the frigates to Taiwan, is
not the only target to be asked to refund the illegal kickbacks.
Nevertheless, he would not reveal the identity of any other defendant
nor the amount of the refunds sought.</P>
      <P>"The special panel is still putting the final touches on the
paperwork," Wu said.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the special investigation panel said that as the
refund suit must follow Switzerland's civil suit procedures, the
report was sent last month to Swiss lawyers retained by Taiwan to
handle the lawsuit.</P>
      <P>"The Swiss lawyers have suggested that we prepare some additional
information and data. We have thus added seven more pages to the
report and are studying follow-up procedural issues with the Swiss
lawyers, " the spokesman said, adding that a French formal lawsuit
will be filed with the Swiss Judicial Department later this year.</P>
      <P>Under a bilateral judicial aid agreement, the Swiss government
handed over to Taiwan a collection of bank files suspected of links
to the Lafayette kickback scandal last November.</P>
      <P>"After poring over the six cases of files brought back from
Switzerland, we discovered that each time our government made a
payment installment for the frigates, a sum roughly equivalent to 18
percent of the payment would 'coincidently' be remitted into bank
accounts owned by Wang or members of his family, "the spokesman
said." We suspect that the remittances were illegal kickbacks."</P>
      <P>The Swiss files show that frozen deposits in the Wang family's
bank accounts top 900 million Swiss francs (about NT$23 billion).
Even after the family's legal assets are deducted, the amount that
Taiwan intends to reclaim would still be astronomical.</P>
      <P>It might take three to five years to conclude the lawsuit, the
spokesman said, adding that Taiwan might still seek judicial aid from
several other relevant countries, including France and Luxembourg, to
back its request for Switzerland to return the money.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the spokesman said, the lawsuit will be very expensive.
According to a preliminary estimate, the cost of retaining foreign
lawyers alone could exceed NT$100 million. "The Ministry of Justice
must appropriate budget for the lawsuit," he added.</P>
      <P>The files brought back from Switzerland include 46 bank accounts
under the names of Wang, his three sons and Wang's company, all of
whose accounts have been frozen by the Swiss Federal Court. Wang is
the key suspect in the scandal.</P>
      <P>The files, which are written in English, French and German, also
include a number of previously hidden overseas bank accounts related
to the US$2.8 billion Lafayette deal, as well as information about
relevant capital flows in Switzerland, judicial authorities said,
adding that the Swiss court files clearly document deposit times and
destinations of the capital.</P>
      <P>Wang fled Taiwan following the death of naval Capt. Yin
Ching-feng, who is widely believed to have been murdered in late 1993
when he was about to blow the whistle on colleagues who were
allegedly taking kickbacks from the deal.</P>
      <P>Wang has been charged in absentia with murder, corruption, money
laundering and fraud.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP CONSIDERS TAKING TO STREETS OVER PRESIDENT'S NUC PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP)
will consider taking to the streets to protest President Chen
Shui-bian's plan to scrap the National Unification Council (NUC) if
he continues pressing ahead toward that end obstinately, PFP
Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Should Chen refuse to abort his plan, the PFP will not shirk its
duty to demand via direct means as allowed in a democratic society
that the president respond to public mandate and act in compliance
with the Republic of China Constitution, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Although the PFP is committed to protecting the Constitution, Liu
said, the party still keenly hopes for concerted action from the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and he urged KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou,
as the "pan blue alliance" leader, to assume his responsibility in
leading the people to the streets.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the PFP has cautiously and thoroughly gauged
all possible consequences, including the worst-case senario, of
Chen's plan to abrogate the NUC and its guidelines, he said that the
"pan blue alliance" must not waste any more time in countering Chen
and demanding that he face up to public expectations.</P>
      <P>Since the ruling Democratic Progressive Party has endorsed Chen's
plan to do away with the NUC, Liu said that the situation has greatly
worsened, which is why the PFP demanded that Minister of Foreign
Affairs Huang Chih-fang and ROC Representative to the United States
David Lee give a report on the latest developments in
Taipei-Washington ties.</P>
      <P>In addition to passing a resolution condemning Chen for having
stepped over the line in cross-Taiwan Strait relations, Liu said that
the PFP also backs an indefinite adjournment of the legislative
session, organizing street protests, or even recalling the president.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Chang Hsien-yao, who is also head of the PFP's
policy center, said that Chen's intention to scrap the NUC is a
matter of major national policy change and will constitute a
violation of his "five noes" promise he made in his inaugural
speeches of 2000 and 2004. "Chen's NUC abolition plan is far more
serious than the 'two states' theory," he claimed.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks about scrapping the NUC and its guidelines have
rippled the political waters at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>While Washington has responded unfavorably to what it has
described as a "surprise" from Chen and has warned against any
unilateral changes to the cross-strait status quo by Taiwan, Beijing
has denounced Chen's plan as the first step of his scheme toward
de-jure Taiwan independence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT TO HEAR NSC REPORT ON ABOLISHING NUC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will call a
National Security Council meeting Monday, during which he will hear a
report on abolishing the National Unification Council (NUC) and
National Unification Guidelines (NUG) , NSC Secretary-General Chiou
I-jen said Sunday.</P>
      <P>As to whether Chen will announce doing away with what he has
called the "anachronistic" NUC and "outdated" NUG after hearing the
report, Chiou said it will be the president's own decision.</P>
      <P>There have been media reports that Chen will make the
controversial announcement Feb. 28, which is Peace Memorial Day.</P>
      <P>In response to Chiou's statement, the opposition "pan blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP), plus
Non-Partisan Solidarity Union, which together enjoy a majority at the
legislature, threatened that they will escalate their pressure on the
president not to do so.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, executive director of the KMT Central Policy
Committee, and Pan Wek-kang, secretary-general of the KMT legislative
caucus, said the opposition's strategy will be "different from what
they had indicated earlier, " including calling for an indefinite
suspension of the legislative meeting and kicking off a
recall-the-president campaign.</P>
      <P>Neither Tseng nor Pan would confirm if their new strategy will
include taking to the streets in protest and boycotting an
interpellation session for Premier Su Tseng-chang at the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>"The president will have to take the full responsibility for the
consequences of his actions if he insists on going ahead with his
expressed intention to abolish the NUC and NUG in disregard of the
the mainstream view and the opposition warning," they said.</P>
      <P>The "pan blue alliance" had earlier called on the president to
"rein in his horse at the edge of the cliff" instead of "leading the
country into the abyss." They also warned that they will take "all
possible actions" to counter Chen's decision to do away with the NUC
and NUG.</P>
      <P>Ko Chien-ming, convener of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP) legislative caucus, said his caucus will fully support
the president if he decides to get rid of the "unnecessary" NUC and
NUG, which commits Taiwan to eventual unification with China.</P>
      <P>Ko's opposition pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
counterpart, Huang Shih-chuo, urged the president to abolish the NUC
and UNG "as soon as possible, in spite of the mounting pressure from
the United States."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's strategic position is in the interests of the U.S.,
which will not abandon Taiwan because of the NUG controversy, Huang
speculated.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO SUFFER OVER FREE TRADE ACCORD BETWEEN CHINA, ASEAN: STUDY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 26 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will see its gross domestic product
(GDP) shrink by 0.0187 percent if it fails to take measures to
cushion the impact of the establishment of a free trade zone between
China the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a think
tank warned Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Institute of Economic Research said in a study that
Taiwan is facing mounting challenges as China and ASEAN are pushing
ahead with a program to establish a free trade area between them by
2010.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will be shunted to the sidelines or will see its
competitiveness seriously undermined if it is shut out of the trade
bloc, which is a likely senario in light of the tense cross-Taiwan
Strait relations, the think tank said.</P>
      <P>As if that were not bad enough, the study said, Japan has
followed China's footsteps in forging an all-out economic cooperation
agreement with ASEAN with an eye to joining the free trade bloc by

bandwagon.</P>
      <P>Should a free trade bloc covering China, Japan, South Korea and
ASEAN take shape, the study predicts, Taiwan businessmen's
investments in ASEAN states will be replaced by Chinese firms, while
multinational firms that are interested in exploring the ASEAN
markets are likely to set up their regional business centers in China.</P>
      <P>The impact of this trend could be alleviated somehow if direct
transportation links between Taiwan and China are
established, according to the study.</P>
      <P>In such a scenario, the study estimates, the decrease in Taiwan's
GDP will be 0.0135 percent. </P>
      <P>Other measures the country could take to brace for this trend is
to improve its economic ties with India, Japan and South Korea and

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BLAMES CHINA FOR CHANGING TAIWAN STRAIT STATUS QUO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 26 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) blamed
China Sunday for enhancing its military preparation to attack Taiwan
and taking other steps that threaten peace and stability across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Over the past 10 years and more, MAC said, China's military
budget has been growing at double-digit rates under a build-up plan
that specifically targets Taiwan, making an irony of its leaders'
routine sweet talks about "striving for peace in the Strait, " MAC
said.</P>
      <P>Its Anti-Secession Law, passed in March 2005, unilaterally denies
the fact that the Republic of China (ROC) is alive and kicking in
Taiwan, MAC said. Moreover, the law stipulates that "unification"
[with China] is a legal obligation and a sacred duty of the people of
Taiwan, it added.</P>
      <P>The Chinese authorities have since 2000 been using this kind of
barbarian strategies to erode the foundation for peace across the
Strait and to push for a change in the status quo of the Strait, said
MAC in a press release.</P>
      <P>MAC pointed out that the ROC is a sovereign country which is
completely independent of the People's Republic of China (PRC) as
neither one has ruled the other since 1949, that is, each's
jurisdiction does not extend to the other.</P>
      <P>"The government of Taiwan firmly advocates that any changes to
the status quo of Taiwan's sovereignty and to its future must be
approved by the 23 million people of Taiwan, and that China does not
have a right to restrain or intervene in Taiwan people's right of
making autonomous decisions," it said.</P>
      <P>It said that since President Chen Shui-bian was inaugurated in
2000, the ROC government's mainland policy has always been aimed at
peace and stability across the Strait and it has taken all possible
steps to safeguard peace and the status quo in the Strait.</P>
      <P>However, it said, maintaining peace and the status quo in the
Strait is not the duty of Taiwan alone. "While we are willing to make
all efforts toward that end, China has violently adopted its
Anti-Secession Law, provoking abhorrence not only in Taiwan but all
over the world," it said.</P>
      <P>It warned that the Chinese authorities must take all of the
responsibility for using various means to menace Taiwan people's
right of autonomy and putting peace and stability across the Strait
at risk.</P>

While international debate rages over the future of the American
detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the military has quietly
expanded another, less-visible prison in Afghanistan, where it now
holds some 500 terror suspects in more primitive conditions,
indefinitely and without charges. Pentagon officials have often
described the detention site at Bagram, a cavernous former machine
shop on an American air base 40 miles north of Kabul, as a screening
center. They said most of the detainees were Afghans who might
eventually be released under an amnesty program or transferred to an
Afghan prison that is to be built with American aid. But some of the
detainees have alreeady been held at Bagram for as long as two or
three years. And unlike those at Guantanamo, they have no access to
lawyers, no right to hear the allegations against them and only
rudimentary reviews of their status as "enemy combatants, " military

      <P>The concert, held in Taiwan for the first time, is titled "From

    <HEADLINE>ABOLISHING NUC NOT TOUCHING PRC, U.S. 'RED LINE': ACADEMICSBy S.C. ChangCNA Staff Writer</HEADLINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P> As President Chen Shui-bian seemed determined to make good on his
word that he will abolish what he called "anachronistic" National
Unification Council (NUC) , putting both China and the United States
on alert, academics said Sunday that what these two giants really
care about is Chen's next step as they will not look at terminating
the NUC as a step on their "red line."</P>
      <P>Chang Wu-yueh, a China expert at Tamkang University, said the NUC
and the National Unification Guidelines (NUG) are less important than
the "four noes" in Chen's "four noes plus one" policy, a commitment
that Chen made in his 2000 inaugural address that he will not declare
Taiwan independence, not change the national title, not push for an
inclusion into the Constitution of a description of cross-Strait
relations as "state-to-state, " and not hold a referendum on
unification versus independence, and therefore "there will not be a
problem of abolishing the NUG", if China does not show military
belligerence toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>What China and the U.S. will be watching after Chen announces
doing away with the NUC and NUG, which commits the self-governing
island to eventual unification with the mainland, is whether he will
take further steps to cross over the "fences of his four noes," Chang
said.</P>
      <P>For instance, if the Chen administration goes on to push for
constitutional changes that could be seen as giving up his "four
noes" pledge, that will be stepping on D.C. and Beijing's "red line,"
he noted. In short, Chen's "four noes" will be D.C. and Beijing's
"Maginot line," he said.</P>
      <P>Chang said China will not take the dismantling of NUC as touching
its "red line" in its Anti-Secession Law because Beijing has claimed
that the law and President Hu Jintao's "four-point policy" toward
Taiwan have worked positively on stabilizing cross-Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Chao Chien-min, a social studies professor of National Chengchi
University, did not think abrogating the NUC would amount to a step
in the direction of de jure independence for Taiwan, as Beijing does.</P>
      <P>Though Beijing would see it that way, Chao said, its response to
Chen's anticipated move will depend on Taiwan's follow-up practices.
Up to now, he said, Beijing has been showing just verbal opposition
to Chen's expressed intention to abolish the NUC. He cited as
evidence that Beijing's top Taiwan affairs official Chen Yunlin still
talked with Taiwan lawmakers about promoting direct charter flights
and sending Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan while denouncing Chen's
abolish-NUC remarks.</P>
      <P>Other experts forecast that the U.S. will take "preventive"
measures in handling Taiwan's NUC controversy, focusing on signs that
the Chen government may try to go around his "four noes" policy.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan takes actions that the U.S. sees as changing the Taiwan
Strait status quo, forcing it to increase dialogue with China over
the Strait issue, it will not serve the interests of Taiwan, Chao
said.</P>

important point is that he should so profit by what you say to him as
to change his conduct. If you speak to a man in parables, he will
probably be pleased with your story; but the important point is that
he should apply the moral to himself."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>EPA DEMANDS REMOVAL OF TOXIC CHEMICAL FROM SUNKEN FREIGTHER</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) has delivered an ultimatum to the owner of a sunken freighter
currently lying on a seabed in waters off the northern county of
Taoyuan, demanding the removal of toxic chemicals on the ship by the
end of May, EPA officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>The 3,561-ton South Korean freighter "Samho Brother" collided
with a Liberian-registered freighter Oct. 10 in waters off Taoyuan.
Several days after the accident, experts found that there was a small
amount of benzene leaking from the cargo ship, which was carrying 85
tons of fuel oil, 16 tons of diesel and 3,140 tons of methyl benzene.</P>
      <P>Taiwan sent two F-16 fighters and an Army combat helicopter to
destroy the damaged freighter and the toxic cargo on board, but only
succeeded in sending the boat down to the 71 km-deep seabed without
burning off the benzene aboard.</P>
      <P>Last week, the EPA demanded that the shipowner remove the cargo
by the end of May at the latest out of concerns that it poses a
threat to both the livelihood and health of Taiwan fishermen and
could escalate into a marine ecological disaster.</P>
      <P>The EPA proposed siphoning the chemical out of the freighter,
while the shipowner asked that the ship be destroyed with explosives
at the site where it currently lies, the EPA officials said. However,
the EPA refused the request out of fear that doing so posed too great
an ecological risk.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW VARIETY OF RICE HAS GOOD CHANCES OF MAKING INROADS INTO JAPAN: COA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chances of a new variety of rice in
Taiwan making inroads into the Japanese market are good, the
Agricultural Research Institute under the Council of Agriculture said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Institute officials were referring to Yih Chuan Aromatic Rice, a
variety named after Kuo Yih-chuan, the head of the Rice Research
Lab under the institute which has helped develop the rice.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that Japan produces 7.8 million tons of rice
annually, but annual consumption is 8.72 million tons, so nearly 1
million tons needs to be imported.</P>
      <P>They said that Yih Chuan rice, with its distinctive taro flavor
and qualities similar to Japanese rice, has the strength and
advantage in terms of making inroads into the Japanese market.</P>
      <P>To learn about the preferences of Japanese consumers, the

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said
Monday that the government's efforts to crack down on illegal
activities involving Chinese people have borne fruit.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Liu Teh-shun made the remarks after an MAC
meeting during which the National Police Administration reported that
it had dealt with cases involving 6,831 Chinese people in the latter
half of 2005.</P>
      <P>The Coast Guard Administration (CGA) also reported in the meeting
that 1,069 illegal Chinese immigrants -- 887 men and 182 women --
were arrested last year, and that 347 Taiwanese were involved in the
human smuggling activities.</P>
      <P>The CGA added that 90 percent of the illegal Chinese immigrants
came from Fujian Province, due to its geographic proximity to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the number of female illegal Chinese immigrants
dropped significantly to 182 in 2005 from 1,077 in 2004, showing that
sex trade rings now prefer to introduce Chinese women through "legal"
channels to evade detection, the CGA said.</P>
      <P>The CGA also warned that the number of illegal Chinese immigrants
entering the country in the guise of fishermen working aboard Taiwan
fishing vessels has increased.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION URGED TO THINK TWICE ABOUT PURSUING RECALL OF PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 27 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
(DPP) legislative caucus cautioned opposition parties Monday about
their planned move to promote a campaign to either recall President
Chen Shui-bian or hold a referendum on the abolition of the National
Unification Council (NUC) and its guidelines, arguing that the move
could turn into a referendum on Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-jun, executive chief of the DPP caucus, said at a news
conference at the Legislative Yuan that the party believes scrapping
the NUC and the National Unification Guidelines is a way to maintain
the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Allowing the NUC and the guidelines to continue to exist is
tantamount to Taiwan "dwarfing its own status and admitting that it
is a part of China," he claimed.</P>
      <P>Since President Chen proposed in his Lunar New Year address Jan.
29 the scrapping of the NUC, which is not a standard government
agency, a campaign to recall the president has been growing in the
pro-unification opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and
the People First Party. The alliance holds a slim majority in the
legislature.</P>
      <P>According to the Constitution, any proposal to recall the
president or vice president must first receive the endorsement of at
least one-fourth of all legislators. As the legislature currently has
220 members, the proposal of KMT Legislator Ting Shou-chung must get
the support of at least 55 lawmakers. Passage of a proposal to recall
the president requires the support of two-thirds of all lawmakers. If
passed, the proposal would then be put to a referendum.</P>
      <P>Forty-five lawmakers have endorsed his motion to recall President
Chen, Ting said Friday, adding that he hopes 10 more lawmakers will
step forward to support the proposal so it can be brought to the
legislative floor for debate. </P>
      <P>Yeh Yi-jin, a DPP caucus whip, urged the opposition parties to
think twice about making the move, warning that pushing for the
recall of the president or the holding of referendum on the NUC issue
would force the people to take sides on the issue of unification
versus independence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THREE PARTIES UNITED IN OPPOSING ABOLITION OF NUC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 27 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three opposition parties threatened Monday
to resort to "whatever means necessary" to oppose the scrapping of
the National Unification Council and its guidelines.</P>
      <P>In a news conference, the whips of the legislative caucuses of
the Kuomintang (KMT) , People First Party (PFP) and Non-Partisan
Solidarity Union (NPSU) said they will demand that Premier Su
Tseng-chang and related Cabinet ministers brief the legislature on
the decision-making process of the policy, which was expected to be
announced later in the day by President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>If that is not enough to stop the president from doing away with
the NUC, the three parties claimed they might take more drastic steps
such as boycotting the legislature, calling for a referendum on
whether to abolish the guidelines, organizing national protests and
pushing for a recall of the president.</P>
      <P>Explaining their options, KMT lawmaker Tseng Yung-chuan, who is
the director of the KMT Policy Coordination Committee, said the
premier should be accountable to the legislature for his
administration's major policies such as the abolition of the NUC and
its guidelines.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Lee Hung-chun, the whip of the PFP legislative caucus,
said the premier, who was believed to be trying to stay clear of the
controversy, should come down from the fence and take responsibility
for the government's decisions.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Lu Hsueh-chang, convener of the PFP legislative caucus,
said his party will favor a KMT lawmaker's proposal to recall the
president if he insists on getting rid of the NUC.</P>
      <P>Noting that there are strict legal procedures to go through
before the legislature can initiate a recall of the president, Lu
said that even an unsuccessful recall could tarnish Chen by marking
him down in history as the country's first president to be targeted
in a recall.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin Su-mei, a lawmaker of the NPSU, said that the president
is plunging the country and its people into danger by doing away with
the guidelines and angering Beijing for his personal political
purposes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FAPA BACKS SCRAPPING NUC PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  26 (CNA)
(By Winnie Chi and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Formosan Association for Public
Affairs (FAPA) -- a non-profit Washington-based group advocating
Taiwan independence -- supports President Chen Shui-bian's plan to
scrap the National Unification Council (NUC) and its guidelines, FAPA
President C.T. Lee said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Speaking to CNA prior to his return to Taiwan, Lee said that FAPA
backs Chen's move and that 12 FAPA members from across the United
States will get together in Taipei to display their firm support for
the plan.</P>
      <P>While in Taiwan, they will also call on former President Lee
Teng-hui, Examination Yuan President Yao Chia-wen and various think
tank members, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The prime purpose of their return to Taiwan, Lee said, is to help
further galvanize Taiwan's democratic system, and promote FAPA's
cooperation with the government and private-sector groups in Taiwan
for the country's future.</P>
      <P>Lee said that they will bring two gifts from the United States to
Chen -- two House resolutions calling for a Taiwan-U.S. Free Trade
Agreement (FTA) and one to allow high-level visits to the United
States by Taiwan's elected leaders and appointed officials, including
the president, vice president, foreign minister and defense minister.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, FAPA wrote to U.S. President George W. Bush and
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice early this month to express
support for Chen's remarks about doing away with the NUC and its
guidelines and urging the Bush Administration to drop its "one China"
policy.</P>
      <P>He said that the "one China" policy should have been thrown into
the ashes of history and that Taiwan's future must be determined by
its people rather than in an "absurd manner" by the governments on
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>China's deployment of more than 700 missile aimed at Taiwan shows
that it is poised to resolve the Taiwan issue through military means,
he claimed, insisting that Taiwan deserves international respect for
its democratic system.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STREET PROTESTS MIGHT BE UNAVOIDABLE: PFP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 27 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Street protests might be "unavoidable" to
try to rein in President Chen Shui-bian from scrapping the National
Unification Council (NUC) and its guidelines, opposition People First
Party (PFP) spokesman Hsieh Kung-ping said Monday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that the PFP will resort to public mandate to press
Chen should the president persist with his plan. The PFP's proposal
to demand that Chen brief lawmakers at the Legislative Yuan or face
an indefinite adjournment of the legislative secession is aimed at
pressing Chen to abort the plan, he said, adding that the PFP will
lead supporters to the streets if Chen continues to insist.</P>
      <P>Commenting on opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker Ting
Shou-chung's proposal to introduce a motion to recall Chen, Hsieh
said that the PFP will respond to the issue but acknowledged that it
will be very difficult to railroad the proposal through the
Legislative Yuan due to the high threshold required for recalling the
president.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucuses of three major opposition parties -- the
KMT, the PFP and the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU) -- called a
news conference at the Legislative Yuan to condemn Chen's NUC
abolition plan. They demanded that Premier Su Tseng-chang and other
relevant government officials report to the legislature on the matter
and threatened to take to the streets if the Cabinet fails to heed
their demand.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen was expected to announce the timetable for the
formal abolition of the NUC after hearing a report from National
Security Council Secretary-General Chiou I-yen a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks about scrapping the NUC and its guidelines in late
January have whipped up controversy at home and abroad. While the
United States has been seeking to persuade Chen to give up the idea,
Beijing has denounced it as the first step in Chen's scheme to move
toward de jure Taiwan independence.</P>

      <P>Three Taiwan officials have decided to
cancel "communication trips" to the United States following an easing
of tensions between Taiwan and the U.S. over the country's plan to do
away with the National Unification Council (NUC) and its guidelines.</P>
      <P>National Security Council Vice Secretary-General Tsai Ming-hsien,
Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Michael Ying-mao Kau and Vice Mainland
Affairs Council Chairman Huang Wei-fang had originally planned to fly
into Washington, D.C. March 1 to allay
U.S. concerns over President Chen Shui-bian's Jan. 29 proposal to
scrap the NUC and the guidelines.</P>
      <P>But both sides have reached a consensus during intensive
consultations of the past week on the wording of Taiwan's move, which
they believe will underscore that "the status quo in the Taiwan
Strait remains unchanged," sources said.</P>
      <P>Both sides have considered the various vocabulary options
including abolish, freeze, suspend, discontinue or cease the NUC,
and were able to smooth out differences and find Chinese and English
terms acceptable to both sides.</P>
      <P>Promises not to scrap the NUC and the guidelines if China has no
intention of using force against Taiwan are contained in Chen's "five
noes" pledges in his 2000 and 2004 inaugural speeches.</P>
      <P>The other pledges are no declaration of independence, no change

    <HEADLINE>NSC MEETING AIMED AT SAFEGUARDING TAIWAN'S DEMOCRACY: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  27 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said he was
holding an unusual National Security Council (NSC) meeting Monday to
underscore the government's determination to safeguard Taiwan's
democracy and to maintain the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The meeting was called on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the
1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis and the first anniversary of China's
enactment of its anti-secession law, with which Beijing gives itself
the option of using "non-peaceful means" to settle differences with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said he wants to make sure that the Taiwan people will not
be deprived of their freedom of choice, in order to practice the
principle of "sovereignty in the hands of the people."</P>
      <P>"I also want to make sure that Taiwan's freedom, democracy and
human rights, as well as peace across the strait, will not be
unilaterally changed, " he said in reference to his definition of the
meaning of Taiwan's status quo.</P>
      <P>Democracy is Taiwan's most precious asset, whose multicultural
nature almost guarantees noisy squabbles over any political issue,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>"However, as a responsible government, we must always stand firm
on our position and march forward with pragmatism, doing the right
thing and walking the correct path so as to face history and the
people," he said.</P>
      <P>Explaining why he must remind the people of the 1996 missile
crisis in the Taiwan Strait, he recalled that immediately prior to
Taiwan's first direct election of its president March 23 of that
year, China launched test missiles March 8 and 13 that landed near
Keelung and Kaohsiung, Taiwan's largest ports in the north and the
south, with one landing just 55 km from Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>At the same time, China was also staging live-fire military
exercises involving land, sea and air troops simulating an invasion
of Taiwan, Chen said, noting that Beijing did not call off the drills
until March 25.</P>
      <P>Even after that, Chen said, China has not ceased its verbal
threats and military scare tactics against Taiwan, whose democracy
has still managed to thrive and prosper, an indication that Taiwan's
democratic development is "by no means a gift from heaven."</P>
      <P>He cited for example that during the 2000 and 2004 presidential
elections, in an attempt to sway Taiwan's democratic process, China
used various means to scare and threaten the people of Taiwan in the
hope that they could be frightened into making choices not of their
own accord.</P>
      <P>Since he won his first presidential election in 2000, Chen
continued, he has sent out many olive branches to China, only to get
more missile deployments and military expansion in return.</P>
      <P>China's People's Liberation Army has even set up a three-stage
plan to invade Taiwan in 2007, 2010 and 2015 as required by its
Anti-Secession Law, an obvious plan to use "non-peaceful means" to
change the status quo in the strait unilaterally, Chen pointed out.
"This is the most real and immediate threat to democratic Taiwan," he
said.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks before participants began to discuss the
issue of doing away with what he has described as the "anachronistic"
National Unification Council (NUC) and "outdated" National
Unification Guidelines, which commit the country to eventual
unification with China.</P>
      <P>Attending the meeting were Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su
Tseng-chang, Presidential Secretary-General Tan Sun Chen, NSC
Secretary-General Chiou I-jen, Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen, Foreign
Minister Huang Chih-fang, Defense Minister Lee Jye, Mainland Affairs
Council Chairman Joseph Wu and other leading national security
officials.</P>

orchid industry are expected to win export orders with a combined
value of over NT$1 billion (US$30.8 million) in an upcoming
international orchid show to be held in the southern county of
Tainan, officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>The 2006 Taiwan International Orchid Show is slated to take place
in the Taiwan Orchid Plantation, a biotechnology science-based park,
March 4-12. Some 300,000 orchids will be on display.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will host the opening of the annual show
March 3, according to the Tainan county government, which is
organizing the event along with the Taiwan Orchid Growers'
Association.</P>
      <P>With the fact that over 400 foreign buyers have registered to
visit the fair, the organizers said companies are expected to send
more than 1,000 representatives to the fair to seek trade deals.</P>
      <P>In the 2005 orchid fair, Taiwan's orchid-related businesses
received NT$860 million-worth of export orders.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's orchid exports reach between 30 million and 35 million
plants per year, accounting for more than half of global market
share, said Lee Tsang-yu, deputy director of the Taiwan Orchid

      <P>However, the industry is faced with strong competition of the

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian made a decision at
a National Security Council (NSC) meeting Monday that in the face of
China's growing military threats against Taiwan, the National
Unification Council (NUC) should cease to operate and the National
Unification Guidelines (NUG) should cease to apply.</P>

"non-peaceful means" to settle differences with Taiwan, in an attempt
to unilaterally change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In an earlier address to the meeting, the president defined
Taiwan's status quo as "democracy, freedom and human rights, as well

    <HEADLINE>KMT TO REACT IF PRESIDENT SCRAPS NUC: CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will
take action if President Chen Shui-bian pushes through his proposal
to abolish the National Unification Council (NUC) and the National
Unification Guidelines, KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Monday.</P>
      <P>Ma, who concurrently serves as Taipei mayor, made the remarks
after presiding over a city government conference.</P>
      <P>Ma said that whether to "abolish" or to "terminate" the NUC is
"only semantics." The NUC, set up by the former KMT administration in
1990, sets the stage for eventual unification with China.
Chen has never convened the NUC since first assuming the presidency
in 2000, so the organization is purely a symbol that the nation will
not seek de jure independence, which China has vowed to stop by
force.</P>
      <P>Ma said semantics are not the key issue and that "what the public
is concerned about are the issues that relate to their daily lives."</P>
      <P>At a time when the nation is plagued with so many economic
problems, the president has stoked the most controversial political
issue, which Ma said will not benefit the public.</P>
      <P>"The president has the wrong priority in setting his political
agenda," Ma said.</P>
      <P>"The president's proposal to do away with the NUC has rocked
Taiwan-U.S. and cross-Taiwan Strait relations," Ma said.</P>
      <P>"The public hopes that the president will refocus on what he
should do, " Ma said, adding that if "he insists on going down the
controversial path, history will record it."</P>
      <P>He said the KMT's consistent stance has been "rational,
accountable and forceful monitoring, " and that it will surely act if
Chen pushes through his proposal.</P>
      <P>On whether the KMT will promote a motion to recall the president,
Ma said that the issue will be decided by the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>KMT spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen also said that the party will act to
counter Chen's move, saying that the party is still assessing various
courses of action.</P>
      <P>She also said that Ma would not be opposed to a recall motion
being proposed by KMT Legislator Ting Shou-chung. Even if the high
threshold of recalling a president will make it almost impossible,
the KMT will still use its mandate given by the public to let the
president feel the pressure, noting that the KMT emerged as the big
winner in the Dec. 3 local elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE CONCERNED ABOUT NUC CONTROVERSY: LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  27 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore is worried that President Chen
Shui-bian's plan to scrap the National Unification Council (NUC) and
its guidelines might have adverse consequences in the region's
situation and affect Singapore's security, Legislative Yuan Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng said Monday.</P>
      <P>Singapore has openly expressed its opposition to Chen's NUC
abolition plan, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The legislative speaker made the remark at Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport upon his return from Singapore with a
legislative delegation, where he said he had met ranking government
officials and Taiwan businessmen.</P>
      <P>Saying that he will meet the legislative caucus whips of various
opposition parties later in the day to gauge countermeasures to
Chen's move, Wang, however, was reserved about a proposal to recall
Chen, on the grounds that recalling the president would be extremely
difficult due to the high vote threshold required for such an action.</P>
      <P>Wang called for caution, patience and pragmatism to cope with the
situation after the government makes its final decision on the NUC
abolition plan, to avert political chaos. Wang is an influential
member in the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition People First Party (PFP) asked its "pan
blue alliance" partner, the KMT, to clarify its stance and
collaborate with the PFP to have a cross-Taiwan Strait peace
promotion bill initiated by the PFP quickly rammed through the
Legislative Yuan, where the PFP and the KMT between them control a
slim majority.</P>
      <P>PFP legislative caucus whip Lee Hung-chun claimed that Chen's NUC
scrapping plan is linked to changing the cross-strait status quo,
regardless of how hard the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
tries to argue to the contrary.</P>
      <P>In the face of the seriousness of the situation, the PFP
maintains that the cross-strait peace promotion bill with a focus on
preserving the status quo must clear the Legislative Yuan swiftly to
allow the legislature to play a role in crafting cross-strait policy
and rein in Chen from acting arbitrarily, he said.</P>
      <P>As the bill has been shelved longer than a four-month negotiation
period, PFP and KMT lawmakers can consider putting the bill to a vote
at the Legislative Yuan to counter Chen through legal means, he
proposed.</P>
      <P>PFP lawmaker Liu Wen-hsiung pointed out that it is hard to
believe that Chen would be so obstinate and show so little concern
about the people's welfare.</P>
      <P>Urging the KMT to take bold countermeasures to deter the DPP's
intention to unilaterally alter the status quo across the strait, he
said that the passage of the cross-strait peace promotion bill would
serve to test the waters of the PFP-KMT partnership.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MEDIA MUST APPLY IN ADVANCE TO COVER NEWS AT AIRPORT: MOI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) said
Monday that media wanting to cover news in restricted areas of the
Chiang Kai-shek International Airport will have to apply 48 hours
beforehand for permission to do so.</P>
      <P>Vice Interior Minister Yen Wan-chin made the remarks when he
announced newly revised regulations on movement in restricted areas
of airport terminals, which will be put into practice March 1.</P>
      <P>Yen said the revisions are based on the principles of
"safeguarding the security and order of the airport, " as well as the
"protection of the press freedom of reporting."
</P>
      <P>He denied that the approach is "backpedalling" as alleged by some
media, who had been largely free to move around the airport at will
in the past and who claim the move is a clampdown on press freedom.</P>
      <P>Under the newly revised regulations, the media will have to apply
to the Aviation Police Bureau 48 hours prior to covering an event, he
said, describing the regulations as "more lax than in most other
countries."</P>
      <P>Yen cited the example of Singapore, where media have to apply 10
days before covering an airport event.</P>
      <P>The National Police Administration had originally planned to have
the media to apply 72 hours beforehand, but this was shortened to 48
hours at the request of Interior Minister Lee Yi-yang. In
"emergencies," even the 48-hour restriction will be lifted.</P>
      <P>He said that out of security considerations, the National Police
Administration had hoped to take a cue from British airports, where
airport staff must accompany reporters covering news stories, but the
requirement was dropped at Lee's insistence.</P>
      <P>The ministry has set up exclusive media zones in non-restricted
areas of the departure and arrival halls at the first and second
terminals of the CKS International Airport, so that reporters no
longer obstruct the movement of passengers or pick-up services.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SOCIETY NORTH TO SUE KMT FOR 228 INCIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 27 (CNA)
(By Taijing Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Society North (TSN) is to take
legal action against the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , seeking
compensation of NT$6 billion for the 228 Incident of 1947.</P>
      <P>The society said it has decided to take civil action against the
KMT for its involvement in the infamous incident and to use the
compensation to build a national human rights museum.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident refers to a series of events beginning in
February 1947 that led to a brutal crackdown by the then-Kuomintang
government against the local population. Thousands of innocent people
were massacred in the tragedy.</P>
      <P>At a press conference at which families of some of the victims of
the incident were present, the Taiwan Society North also demanded
that the KMT offer an apology in local newspapers and hand over to
Academia Historica related archives still kept by the KMT. The
society urged the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the
opposition parties to push for legislation on the incident.</P>
      <P>Chen Yi-shen, the society's deputy chairman, said the KMT should
take responsibility for its role in the tragedy, adding that it is
not enough for the KMT simply to make "perfunctory gestures" such as
making documentary films or organizing memorial services.</P>
      <P>He said that although the government has offered compensation to
the families of the victims of the 228 Incident and has established a
foundation to deal with related issues, they are only administrative
measures.</P>
      <P>The society believes legal action is also required in order to
right the wrongs, he added.</P>
      <P>The society has asked Wellington Koo, a lawyer and TSN member, to
take the legal action on behalf of the society. Koo said the date for
launching the legal actions will be decided at a later date.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Society North is a civic group founded in June 2001
consisting mostly of Taiwanese intellectuals. It was created to help
the government cultivate Taiwan-centric values in the nation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COURT SUMMONS FORMER MINISTER TO TESTIFY ON ETC SCANDAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb.  27 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei District Prosecutors' Office
summoned former Minister of Transportation and Communications Lin
Ling-san Monday in its investigation into a bribery scandal involving
the awarding of a contract for the electronic toll collection (ETC)
system being used on Taiwan's freeways.</P>
      <P>Divisional Head Prosecutor Lin Pang-liang told reporters that the
Prosecutors' Office needed to question the former minister in order
to find out whether his ministry intervened in the selection of the
winning bidder.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the decision to summon the former minister had
nothing to do with a ruling by the Taipei High Administrative Court
on a case related to the scandal.</P>
      <P>The Taipei High Administrative Court ruled last Friday that the
screening process by the Taiwan Area National Expressway Bureau under
the Ministry of Transportation and Communications violated the
principles of public interest and equality and that the priority
applicant status of the ETC system Far Eastern Electronic Toll
Collection Co., which won the contract to operate the ETC system,
should be revoked.</P>
      <P>The prosecutor investigating the scandal said the Taipei District
Prosecutor's Office has already uncovered the money trail of a bribe
given by the contractors who won the bid to Lin Ling-san's former
secretary, Soong Nai-wu.</P>
      <P>Soong is suspected of leaking secret documents about the ETC to
the contractors through a middleman, former Chingyeh Co. Assistant
Manager Tsai Chin-hung, before the bidding took place. Soong and Tsai
have been released on bail of NT$300,000 and NT$500,000,
respectively.</P>
      <P>The prosecutor also said that the prosecutor's office needed to
know whether Lin Ling-san, as Soong's superior, was aware of Soong's
involvement in the scandal at the time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STATUS QUO UNCHANGED BY DECISION TO CEASE NUC FUNCTION: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  27 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday his
decision to cease the operation of the National Unification Council
(NUC) would not change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>What is important is the Taiwanese people's freedom of choice, he
said. Based on this precept, he said he would not rule out any
possible form of future development in cross-strait relations,
although he insisted that no one would lay out certain choices or "an
ultimate goal" for the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen accused China of trying to change the status quo in the
Strait by ratcheting up its military threat against Taiwan and
passing an "Anti-Secession Law," which gives Beijing the power to use
"non-peaceful means" to settle its differences with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said he made the decision to cease the NUC's operation --
whereupon the National Unification Guidelines would also cease to
apply -- in order to safeguard the people's freedom of choice and to
maintain his version of the status quo -- "freedom, democracy, human
rights and peace across the Strait."</P>
      <P>At an extraordinary National Security Council (NSC) meeting, the
president thanked United States President George W. Bush for his 2005
address in Kyoto, Japan, in which Bush praised Taiwan's democratic
and economic achievements and said the U.S. treasured its partnership
with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen appreciated learning that the U.S. looks forward to
continued cooperation with Taiwan on issues of mutual interest.</P>
      <P>He stated that Taiwan does not intend to change the status quo
and opposes any attempts to use non-peaceful means to do so. He
showed his gratitude to the international community for its efforts
in helping maintain the status quo in the Strait.</P>
      <P>He called on China to enter into dialogue with Taiwan's
government in an effort to build a mechanism for interaction and
exchanges, through which trust could be increased, differences
settled and problems solved.</P>
      <P>A mechanism for government-to-government talks would serve the
greatest interest of people on both sides of the Strait and promote a
normalization of cross-strait ties, he said.</P>
      <P>As the people of Taiwan have the right -- as well as the
obligation -- to attend international activities, and are willing to
make a contribution in the world, Chen said China's heavy-handed
oppression of Taiwan's international space not only flies in the face
of universal values of freedom, democracy and human rights but also
hurts the feelings of people on both sides of the Strait, and "does
not at all help a stable development of cross-strait ties."</P>
      <P>In order to stop a tilt in the military balance toward Beijing's
favor, Chen said Taiwan would take proactive measures to boost its
determination and ability to defend itself.</P>
      <P>Taiwan must boost its defense so that its status quo of freedom,
democracy and peace will not be changed unilaterally, he noted.</P>
      <P>After doing away with the NUG, which he pledged not to change as
part of his "four noes plus one" commitment, Chen said he will
continue to push for his "constitutional reengineering" project in
accordance with existing constitutional procedures.</P>
      <P>Any changes to the Constitution must win three-quarters of votes
in the legislature and a "yes" from half of eligible voters in a
referendum.</P>
      <P>Any proposed constitutional amendment that fails to pass through
constitutional procedures and does not help maintain Taiwan's status
quo will simply not be handled, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Interior Minister Lee Yi-yang announced a
police personnel reshuffle Monday, with Criminal Investigation Bureau
Commissioner Hou Yu-ih replacing Hsieh Yin-tang as the
director-general of the National Police Administration (NPA).</P>
      <P>Hou, 50, will be the country's youngest police officer ever to
assume the top NPA post.</P>
      <P>Noting that Hou has long been known locally as the nation's top
crime fighter, Lee said Hou is expected to help further enhance the
public's confidence in the government's resolve and capability to
maintain law and order.</P>
      <P>"It is also hoped that Hou will help create a safer, more secure
and healthier living environment with his professionalism and can-do
spirit," Lee said.</P>
      <P>During his 26-year police career, Hou has played leading roles in
solving numerous major criminal cases, including the Pa Hsiao-yen
kidnap-murder case, the shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice
President Annette Lu on teh eve of 2004 presidential election and the
arrests of several notorious fugitives.</P>
      <P>As to Hou's predecessor, Lee said Hsieh will be transferred to
serve as president of Central Police University. Praising Hsieh for
his success in reining in rampant fraud, lowering burglary and theft,
and upgrading the police approval ratings during his two-year stint
at the NPA, Lee said Hsieh is expected to further improve police
education and practical training after taking over the police
university presidency.</P>
      <P>Lee said he has briefed Premier Su Tseng-chang on both Hou's and
Hsieh's new assignments and that relevant changeover ceremonies will
take place after the Executive Yuan finalizes official filing of the
reshuffle.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee said the replacement to fill the post to be left
vacant by Hou's promotion will be announced later.</P>

Wall Street Journal: Parental Rights, A Law's Fallout: Women in
Prison Fight for Custody

Under a 1997 federal law, states must move to end the rights of
parents whose children have been in foster care for 15 of the past 22
months. Since then, the population of women in prison has exploded --
to more than 104,800 from 79,624 -- and now the law is raising
difficult questions about what is best for children whose parents are
incarcerated. Prison sentences for many women are longer than the
15-month period the law dictates, meaning they automatically risk
losing their children. The U.S. is the only nation that routinely
moves to terminate the parental rights of incarcerated parents whose
children are in foster care, according to international family-law
specialists.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>INAUGURATION OF NCC SLATED FOR MARCH 1</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb.  27  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Communications Commission
(NCC), established to oversee matters related to telecommunications,
broadcasting, and some IT services, is scheduled to be formally
inaugurated Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Minister Without Portfolio Wu Feng-shan will preside over the
inaugural ceremony and unveil the NCC's name-plate at its temporary
office location. He will also introduce the commission's members, its
chairman and two deputy chairmen.</P>
      <P>According to law, the NCC may have 13 members, who are
recommended by Taiwan's political parties in proportion to seats held
in the legislature and then appointed by the Cabinet. However, the
commission currently has only nine members because three others
recommended by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) have
tendered their resignations.</P>
      <P>As the opposition "pan-blue" alliance -- the Kuomintang and the
People First Party (PFP)-- jointly holds a slight majority in the
legislature, their NCC nominations outnumber those recommended by the
DPP.</P>
      <P>On March 22, the nine newly appointed NCC members held their
first meeting and elected Su Yeong-chin as its chairman. Su was
recommended by the main opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Shyr Shry-hau, recommended by the DPP, and Liu Zong-de,
recommended by the PFP, were elected as deputy chairs.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the NCC has seen a rough ride since the bill
providing for its creation was delivered to the Legislative Yuan for
ratification last year. Even after the law came into effect Nov. 9
and its 12 members were approved by the legislature in accordance
with law Jan. 12, the NCC was still unable to begin functioning.</P>
      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh refused to appoint the NCC members and
instead asked the Council of Grand Justices to rule on whether the
NCC's Organic Law was unconstitutional, because, he claimed, it
infringed upon the executive branch's constitutional powers.</P>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang appointed the NCC's members only after
opposition parties threatened to boycott his administrative report at
the opening of the new legislative session Feb. 21.</P>
      <P>The Council of Grand Justices is scheduled to hold a hearing
March 8 to listen to views presented by the Executive Yuan, other

    <HEADLINE>KMT SUPPORTS MOTION TO RECALL PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  27  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Monday threw its support behind
Legislator Tung Shou-chung's proposed motion to recall President
Chen Shui-bian for having announced a decision to cease
operations of the National Unification Council (NUC).</P>
      <P>Ting said he has collected signatures from 57 legislators --
more than a quarter of the Legislative Yuan, thereby surpassing the
legal minimum -- and that he would propose a motion to recall the
president during the next Procedure Committee meeting.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, executive director of the KMT's Central Policy
Committee, said the KMT caucus was aware that it would be difficult
to pass the motion, but his caucus insisted on supporting it, he
said, in order to inform the public that the president defied the
mainstream view and therefore endangered the public interest.</P>
      <P>"Whether it's abolishing the NUC or ceasing its operations, such
a move hampers Taiwan's efforts to maintain the status quo. It will
be seen as a step closer to de jure Taiwan independence and harm
Taiwan-U.S. relations," Tseng said.</P>
      <P>He called on "conscientious Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
colleagues" to endorse Ting's motion by signing the petition.</P>
      <P>KMT's "pan-blue alliance" ally, the People First Party (PFP) ,
said Taiwan should next pass the party's bill on promoting
cross-Taiwan Strait peace, which has yet to be put on the legislative
agenda.</P>
      <P>The bill would stop cross-strait tensions from rising in the wake
of President Chen's decision to stop the NUC's functioning, and could
also avoid a war which could be triggered at any moment, the PFP's
legislative caucus claimed.</P>
      <P>Ko Shu-min, the caucus' deputy convener, cited the
Ministry of Education's Chinese-language dictionary as saying
"to cease" meant "to terminate or end," adding that the president
was playing a game of words that would neither safeguard Taiwan's
sovereignty nor protect its national security.</P>
      <P>Caucus convener Lu Hsueh-chang said Chen was purposely provoking
China, and that only his party's peace promotion bill could serve as
a firewall that would institutionalize Chen's "four noes plus one"
policy and the "1992 consensus," and make peace possible, he
claimed.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said even though Chen's
choice of words had been milder than "abolishing" the NUC and NUG,
the decision had still failed to meet people's expectations and "many

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN HAS NEVER WAVERED ON PLEDGE: NSC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has never wavered
in his determination to uphold promises he made in his 2000 inaugural
speech as long as the Taiwan Strait status quo remained unchanged, a
National Security Council (NSC) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>NSC Secretary-General Chiou I-jen made the remarks after
President Chen Shui-bian announced at the end of an NSC meeting
earlier the same day that the National Unification Council (NUC)
would "cease to function" and the National Unification Guidelines
would "cease to apply, " in order to preserve "Taiwan's freedom,
democracy, human rights, and the peaceful status quo," and safeguard
its people's right and freedom to decide Taiwan's future relations
with China.</P>
      <P>Chiou said President Chen's decision was based on a combination
of factors. First of all, a recent Legislative Yuan resolution
required the Presidential Office to dissolve all non-standard
institutions, including the NUC which was created in 1990 by the
then-Kuomintang (KMT) administration, without being authorized or
approved by the legislature.</P>
      <P>Second, Chiou said that since China passed its "Anti-Secession
Law" targeting Taiwan nearly a year ago, the cross-strait military
and diplomatic balance has continued to tilt in China's favor.</P>
      <P>Third, Chiou said the main opposition Kuomintang publicly
advocates "ultimate unification" as the country's direction in
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>"Democracy is a safety valve for Taiwan's security. The KMT's
advocacy is in grave violation of the cardinal democratic principle
of free choice, and deprives the people of independence as an
option," Chiou said.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan would do whatever possible to maintain the
cross-strait status quo, Chiou said that under President Chen's
leadership, the National Security Council was forced to address the
"unification council and unification guidelines" issue.</P>
      <P>"What we have done is to underscore our firm stance on defending
the status quo, " Chiou said, adding that he hoped the international
community could clearly see who the "troublemaker" was.</P>
      <P>Chiou emphasized that the "four noes plus one" pledge made in
President Chen's 2000 inaugural speech was based on the premise that
China had no intention of using military force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"In 2000, China deployed 200-plus missiles targeting Taiwan. Now
the number of Chinese missiles aimed at Taiwan has skyrocketed to
more than 800, marking a four-fold growth. China's gradual unilateral
destruction of the status quo does not contribute to the region's
stability or security," Chiou said.</P>
      <P>The "four noes" refers to a pledge that there will be no
declaration of Taiwan independence, no change to Taiwan's official
title, no inclusion of the "state-to-state" concept into the
Constitution and no holding of a referendum to change the status quo
regarding the question of independence versus unification. The "plus
one" refers to no abolition of the National Unification Council and
its guidelines, both of which commit Taiwan to pursue cross-strait
unification.</P>

in what I say without being able to profit by it by changing his
conduct, or one who is pleased with my parable without being able to
apply the moral to himself -- I can do nothing for such a man."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>WHITE HOUSE WELCOMES CHEN'S COMMITMENT TO CROSS-STRAIT PEACE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Feb. 27 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The White House welcomed President Chen
Shui-bian's reaffirmation Monday of his administration's commitment
to cross-strait peace and stability and to the pledges he made in his
inaugural address not to unilaterally alter the status quo in the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>White House spokesman Scott McClellan said the United States
continues to stress the need for Beijing to open a meaningful
dialogue with the duly elected leadership in Taiwan for the peaceful
resolution of their differences.</P>
      <P>In reply to a reporter's question about Chen's earlier
announcement to scrap the National Unification Council (NUC) , the
spokesman emphasized that "our policy is clear and consistent when it
comes to cross-strait relations. Our one-China policy remains based
on the three communiques, the Taiwan Relations Act and our belief
that there should be no unilateral change in the status quo by either
side."</P>
      <P>Responding to a reporter's observation that U.S. President George
W. Bush "was upset about Chen Shui-bian's plan to try to unilaterally
change the status quo, " McClellan said: "That's why I talked about
the reaffirmation that he has made. It did not abolish the National
Unification Council. Today he reaffirmed commitments made during the
2000 and 2004 inaugural addresses, and the United States attaches
great importance to those commitments."</P>
      <P>A journalist asked him: "Chen Shui-bian has been trying to push
the envelope and to change the status quo defined by the U.S.
government over the past few years, causing a lot of concerns and
attention in Taipei, Beijing and Washington. So my question is,
should the U.S. national security and foreign policy, and also the
important U.S.- China relations be challenged by Chen's inconsistency
and by his personal selfish political agenda?"</P>
      <P>To that, McClellan replied, "Again, I don't think it changes what
I just said. We do not believe that there should be any unilateral
change in the status quo by either side. And our policy remains the
same."</P>

    <HEADLINE>'CEASING' NUC OPERATIONS 'PLAYING WITH WORDS': U.S. SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb. 27 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's decision to
"cease" the operations of the National Unification Council (NUC) is
simply "a playing with words," a U.S. scholar said Monday.</P>
      <P>June Teufel Dreyer, a professor in the Department of Political
Science at University of Miami, was commenting on President Chen's
declaration at the end of a National Security Council meeting in
Taipei Monday that the NUC will "cease to function" and the National
Unification Guidelines will "cease to apply" in order to safeguard
the 23 million Taiwan people's right and freedom to choose the
direction of relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"This is, of course, a playing with words. It reminds me a bit of
the functions of the Taiwan provincial government being suspended
rather than the provincial government being abolished," Dreyer said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the NUC and the guidelines had long ago ceased to
function, Dreyer said suspending them clearly does not represent a
change in the status quo.</P>
      <P>Since President Chen revealed his intention in his Lunar New
Year's Day speech Jan. 29 to scrap the NUC and the guidelines,
controversies have been simmering. The NUC and the guidelines which
commit Taiwan to eventual unification with China were created in 1990
and 1991, respectively, by the then-Kuomintang government.</P>
      <P>In his 2000 and 2004 inauguration speeches, President Chen made
the "five noes" pledge, one of which was not to abolish the NUC and
the guidelines.</P>
      <P>His Jan. 29 speech angered Beijing and alarmed Washington. After
intensive Taiwan-U.S. communications and consultations, Chen used the
word "cease" instead of "abolish" in his declaration about the NUC
and the guidelines' fate.</P>
      <P>"I am pleased that a face-saving way out has been found, " Dreyer
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Arthur Waldron, a professor of international relations
at the University of Pennsylvania, said he thinks that Taiwan need
not fiddle with symbolism, such as these "moribund councils and
guidelines."</P>
      <P>"I believe what the people of Taiwan want is good governance, the
cleaning up of corruption, etc. So I do not think that President Chen
is directing his attention to the real issues, " he contended.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan is a sovereign state, Waldron said it is not
clear to him why the United States should pay so close attention to
the structures of its government. "Taiwan has elected authorities, a
parliament, and voters to decide those things."</P>
      <P>"If the U.S. starts trying to tell Taiwan which boards and
bureaus it can and cannot have, there will be no end to it. And to be
fair, we should do the same for China, which would be crazy, "
Waldron continued.</P>
      <P>He asked what did the United States said when China passed its
Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan. "We cannot intervene
capriciously. To intervene consistently is beyond our capacity."</P>
      <P>"As for effect, we will have to see what the PRC does. They have
succeeded in enlisting Washington to do their work in Taiwan. That
shows some skill on their part, or lack of intelligence on ours. Now
what do they do? They either make a huge stink or they do not. How
the U.S. will then react is hard to say, given that PRC is constantly
squeezing Taiwan, arresting dissidents, and doing other things of
which we disapprove," Waldron went on.</P>
      <P>He also questioned the rationale of the United States' emphasis
on maintaining the Taiwan Strait status quo.</P>
      <P>"In the longer run, we are seeing that trying to stop change,
which is the object of the status quo argument, is futile. China is
certainly changing. So is Taiwan," he noted.</P>
      <P>According to Waldron, what is woefully missing from the U.S.
position is any indication of what it sees as a "believable, possible
and desirable future for Taiwan."</P>
      <P>"Let's face facts. Taiwan is not about to join the PRC. The
Carter policy of 1979 has failed. But we and the world have nothing
to say to the free and democratic people of Taiwan beyond, 'don't
move, keep a low profile, don't say anything, don't knock at the
front door.' A negative approach eventually fails. But we have no
positive vision," he lamented.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BUSH NOT EXPECTED TO REPROACH TAIWAN AT MEETING WITH HU: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. President George W. Bush is not
expected to reproach Taiwan during his planned meeting with Chinese
President Hu Jintao at the White House in April over President Chen
Shui-bian's decision to cease the operations of the National
Unification Council (NUC), a senior Taiwan official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Both Taiwan and the United States are liberal democracies and
have shared values in freedom, democracy and peace, while China is
the world's sixth most dictatorial country. It would be unacceptable
to the American people if Bush were to criticize Taiwan during his
meeting with the top Chinese leader, " Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Chairman Joseph Wu said confidently.</P>
      <P>Back in December 2003, U.S. President George W. Bush criticized
Taiwan's head of state during the former's meeting with visiting
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao over Chen's insistence on holding a
referendum simultaneously with the 2004 presidential election. As
Chinese President Hu Jintao is scheduled to make an official visit to
the United States in April, some observers have speculated that a
similar scenario may occur over Chen's NUC decision.</P>
      <P>Speaking in a television interview, Wu said he is confident that
there will not be a repeat of the 2003 scenario. To the best of his
understanding, he said, many Americans felt that Bush's 2003 move was
not appropriate.</P>
      <P>"Promoting freedom and democracy has been a major U.S. foreign
policy goal. I don't think that the United States would appease
totalitarian China at Taiwan's expense," Wu said.</P>
      <P>The nation's mainland policy planner further said President
Chen's decision to cease the operations of the NUC will not bring the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait to the brink of war.</P>
      <P>"If there is a crisis in the Taiwan Strait, it's all because
China has deployed a large number of missiles targeting Taiwan, " Wu
said. "China's military buildup against Taiwan is the root cause of
any cross-strait crisis."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-U.S.-CHINA TIES TO REMAIN UNCHANGED IN SHORT TERM: SCHOLARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The delicate triangular Taiwan-U.S.-China
relations will remain unchanged in short term despite President Chen
Shui-bian's controversial decision to cease the operations of the
National Unification Council (NUC), two local scholars said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Liao Ta-chi, director of National Sun Yat-sen University's
Graduate Institute of Political Science, and Hsu Yung-ming, an
Academia Sinica researcher, made the comments after President Chen
declared a day earlier that the NUC will "cease to function" and the
guidelines on unification will "cease to apply" because no outcome in
relations across the Taiwan Strait should be preordained.</P>
      <P>Both Liao and Hsu agreed that the wording of Chen's declaration
in which the term "cease" replaced the more controversial "abolish"
was a compromise with the United States.</P>
      <P>One of the "five noes" promises Chen made in his 2000 inaugural
speech was not to abolish the NUC and the guidelines. Using the word
"cease" instead of "abolish" showed Chen's sensitivity to concerns by
the United States and others that he should not renege on his pledge.</P>
      <P>"The larger question now will be whether the United States will
continue to trust Chen after all the dust-up over the NUC issue, "
Liao said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the NUC and the guidelines on unification have been
all-but defunct since Chen became president six years ago, Liao said
Chen's latest move could lead the United States to question what
Chen's next step will be.</P>
      <P>She further said the most special point in the NUC controversy
lied in the U.S. efforts in letting Chen understand the U.S. aversion
to seeing any unilateral move by Taiwan to alter the cross-strait
status quo which might increase the potential for regional
instability.</P>
      <P>"My observation is that the United States has made it clear to
Chen through the NUC issue that at stake in any cross-strait
turbulence is not only the 23 million Taiwan people's rights and
interests but also those of the 300 million American people, " Liao
observed.</P>
      <P>Throughout the NUC controversy, Liao said, China was not involved
in any direct contact with Taiwan and instead relied on the U.S. in
pressuring Taipei.</P>
      <P>"It seems to me that in handling the NUC dust-up, both the United
States and China have tried to separate Chen from ordinary Taiwan
people. I don't think China is likely to punish the Taiwan people
because of Chen's decision to 'cease' the NUC's operations, and the
triangular Taiwan-U.S.-China relations are not expected to change for
the time being, " Liao said, adding she believes that the United
States has clearly let Chen understand where the bottom line is.</P>
      <P>Hsu agreed with Liao's view that the United States and China have
jointly handled the NUC issue.</P>
      <P>"What we must observe now is whether Beijing will accept this
Taiwan-U.S. compromise. It's not likely that it will explicitly state
its acceptance of it, but so long as Beijing doesn't take any drastic
action, President Chen has scored a win," Hsu argued.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In response to President Chen
Shui-bian's decision to cease the operations of the National
Unification Council, the State Department said Monday that "it's our
understanding that President Chen did not abolish it, and he
reaffirmed Taiwan's commitment to the status quo."</P>
      <P>"We attach great importance to that commitment and we'll be
following his follow-through carefully, " State Department spokesman
Adam Ereli said during a regular briefing.</P>
      <P>As usual, he began his answers to reporters' questions concerning
Taiwan by saying that "our policy on cross-strait relations has not
changed. Our one-China policy is based on the three communiques and
the Taiwan Relations Act. We are, of course, opposed to any
unilateral change to the status quo by either side, and we do not
support Taiwan independence."</P>
      <P>"I would note today that President Chen reaffirmed his continuing
commitment to the pledges he made in his 2000 inaugural address not
to change the status quo across the strait. And we continue to stress
the need for Beijing to open a dialogue with the elected leadership
in Taiwan," Ereli added.</P>
      <P>In response to a Xinhua News Agency reporter's question about
whether Chen's move represents a change to the status quo and what
the U.S. definition of a change to the status quo is, Ereli said: "I
think President Chen has said that he is committed to the status quo
and that he is committed to the pledges in his inaugural speech....
We attach great importance to those commitments and we will be
following events closely."</P>
      <P>As to what the U.S. will be following closely, he said the U.S.
continues to stress the importance of dialogue between Beijing and
Taiwan on cross-straits issues. "It is important, we believe, that
resolution of this issue avoid unilateral steps and focus on
dialogue. And that's the tact that we encourage both sides to take, "
he added.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that his understanding of the meaning of ceasing
the NUC's functions is that "it has not been abolished. It's been
frozen." Chen himself has said that he is committed to the status
quo, and that he is committed to his inaugural pledges, and "that is
an important statement of policy, " Ereli said. Since Chen has
reaffirmed that he is committed to his inaugural pledges, "we're
going to hold him to those pledges, " he added.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the United States has "a very clear and
consistent policy that is focused on preventing either side from
taking unilateral actions that affect the status quo."</P>
      <P>"So it's very important -- the public statements that we've heard
from Chen today, and it's very important that based on those public
statements and based on what the leadership of Taiwan has said is a
commitment not to change the status quo, that you move beyond the
news of the day and talk about the real issues that are causing
problems," he said.</P>
      <P>"The United States is working to promote a resolution of
cross-strait differences, and that's the objective that we're going
to continue to focus on," he added.</P>

      <P>Businesspeople have expressed their hope for
cross-Taiwan Strait peace and Taiwan's prosperity in response to
President Chen Shui-bian's announcement Monday of his decision to
cease the operations of the National Unification Council (NUC).</P>
      <P>Chen Cheng-yi, spokesman for the General Chamber of Commerce,
said Monday that what the commercial and industrial sectors hope for
most is "peace outside and stability inside."</P>
      <P>"Harmony brings wealth, " Chen said, noting that all the chamber
of commerce's members hope that the current political uncertainty in
Taiwan can be swept away so that those in the commercial and
industrial sectors can plan out their long-term investments.</P>
      <P>Mentioning that Taiwan exports have been booming since the fourth
quarter of last year, Chen said no businessperson wants to see the
country embroiled in political disputes. He expressed the hope that
both the ruling and opposition parties can work together for the
people's welfare.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Luo Huai-chia of the Taiwan Electrical and Electronic
Manufacturers' Association said that a stable political environment
is essential for cross-strait economic and trade development. The
association has been hoping that the government will make issues
concerning the people's livelihood and welfare a top priority.</P>
      <P>Wang Tiao-chun, secretary-general of the Council for Industrial
and Commercial Development, said although the decision to cease the
NUC's operations is expected to have an impact on the future
development of cross-strait relations, the domestic comercial and
industrial sectors remain hopeful about prosperity for Taiwan and
cross-strait peace and that the disputes over unification versus
independence can be resolved.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The 2006 Taipei International Cycle Show --
the largest bicycle industry showcase in Asia and the third largest
of its kind in the world -- is slated to be held March 8-11 at the
Taipei World Trade Center.</P>
      <P>More than 2,100 booths will be set up by 650 foreign and domestic
companies. The number of booths represents a 5-percent increase over
the figure for the previous year, according to the event's organizer,
the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA).</P>
      <P>The Taipei International Cycle Show, the world's third largest
behind only the annual events held in Germany and the United States,
expects to attract over 4,000 buyers from around the world this year,
including the Italian bicycle maker Atala S.P.A. and the Halfords
Group from the United Kingdom, TAITRA said, noting that the two big
buyers plan to hold procurement workshops during the fair.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's bike industry has succeeded in transforming itself into
one with world-acclaimed brand names, such as Giant and Merida, from
one made up of traditional contract manufacturers. According to
statistics, Taiwan exported 2.775 million bicycles in the first six
months of 2005, with the total value of the exports reaching US$52.27
million.</P>
      <P>The fact that the value of bike exports posted a year-on-year
growth of 35 percent demonstrates that the Taiwan bicycle sector's
efforts to develop and manufacture products with high added value
have borne fruit, TAITRA officials said.</P>
      <P>Giant, created by the Taichung-based Giant Manufacturing Co. is
the world's seventh largest brand name in the bicycle sector, while
Merida of the Merida Industry Co. headquartered in Changhua, central
Taiwan, is the 19th largest.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States Federal Reserve is not
expected to increase the federal funds rate sharply in the coming
months and will likely halt the trend by mid-year after raising it to
4.5 percent at the end of January, the Council of Economic Planning
and Development (CEPD) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The CEPD said that to stop the economy from overheating and to
curb inflation caused by soaring oil prices, the Fed continually
raised its federal interest rates last year from 2.25 percent in
January to 4.25 percent in December.</P>
      <P>The rate-hiking moves of the U.S. affected central banks in
Europe, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Thailand, who responded in kind to keep
their consumer prices in check and in order to stabilize their
economies, according to the CEPD.</P>
      <P>It said a series of rate increases in the U.S. has raised
borrowing costs and stamped consumer spending, causing concerns that
shrinking U.S. domestic consumption could cut a dent in the global
trade, said the CEPD.</P>
      <P>It quoted the Federal Reserve Board's Feb. 21 meeting records as
saying the U.S. interest rate has reached a certain level, beyond
which the Fed may not raise the rate by a substantive margin. The

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu compared the
National Unification Council (NUC) Tuesday to "spoiled food in a
freezer" that must be discarded.</P>
      <P>She made the remarks in the southern Taiwan city of Chiayi after

to continue a KMT policy.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States has responded in a
"positive and moderate" way to President Chen Shui-bian's
announcement that the National Unification Council (NUC) will cease
operations, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Michel Lu made the remarks after statements by the White House
and the U.S. State Department in the wake of President Chen's
announcement Monday.</P>
      <P>White House spokesman Scott McClellan said the U.S. welcomes
President Chen's reaffirmation of his administration's commitment to
cross-strait peace and stability and to the pledges he made in his
inaugural address.</P>
      <P>State Department deputy spokesman Adam Ereli said that the U.S.
understanding is that President Chen did not abolish the NUC, but
has frozen it, and that he reaffirmed Taiwan's commitment to the
status quo. "We attach great importance to that commitment, " he
added.</P>
      <P>Lu said that the ministry has heeded the response of the United
States and initially concluded that the U.S. attitude is "positive
and moderate."</P>
      <P>Although there had been a "gap in perception" between Taiwan and
the U.S. after President Chen proposed Jan. 29 that Taiwan should
consider scrapping the NUC and the National Unification Guidelines,
whose ultimate goal is eventual unification with China, the two sides
have through communications achieved a result that is acceptable to
both sides, Lu said.</P>
      <P>"This shows that bilateral communications have been smooth and
effective," he added.</P>
      <P>Asked why Washington used the term "frozen" instead of the term
"cease to function" used by Taipei to refer to the decision on the
NUC's operations, Lu said that "we've heeded the wording of the U.S.,
"adding that Washington has its own view but that Taiwan has clearly
conveyed its sense to the U.S. and the international community
through its wording.</P>
      <P>He said that during the communication process, Taiwan had
reaffirmed "its commitment to maintain the status quo, " which is
also the focus of the official response of the U.S, showing that the
Washington fully understands Taiwan's stance and that it has
continued to prod both sides of the Taiwan Strait not to unilaterally
change the status quo and to urge Beijing to engage in dialogue with
Taiwan's duly elected leaders.</P>
      <P>Lu also said that the ministry has sent related information on
the ceasing of the NUC's operations to Taiwan's 122 overseas missions
and that it will closely heed the official responses from other
nations.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese investors with operations in
China are being pressured to make comments unfavorable to Taiwan due
to their heavy reliance on the Chinese market, Taiwan Thinktank
Chairman Chen Po-chih said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese business owners in China are often forced to make
comments against Taiwan that are not what they really think, Chen
said, in a reference to a Monday news report that cited a China-based
Taiwan trade association chairman as saying that President Chen
Shui-bian's decision to have the National Unification Council (NUC)
"cease to function" and its guidelines "cease to apply" would fan
capital flight to China out of a fear of increased insecurity in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said that such remarks are questionable and that he
suspected the Taiwanese businessman in question made the comments as
a result of pressure from China. Remarks made last year by former Chi
Mei Corp. Chairman Shi Wen-long in favor of Beijing's passage of the
Anti-Secession Law were another example, he said.</P>
      <P>Both the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the leading main
opposition Kuomintang have left Taiwan's future open for the people
to decide, but President Chen's ceasing of the nominal NUC has
immediately drawn a negative response from China, he said.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said that no
matter Chen wanted to "scrap" the NUC or "cease its operations, " the
motivation for the plan remained unchanged; that is, designed to
incite Taiwan's independence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT URGED TO BETTER PRESERVE CROSS-STRAIT PEACE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  28 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
called Tuesday for "careful handling" by President Chen Shui-bian in
preserving peace across the Taiwan Strait and for Taiwan's future and
survival.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks in a speech given at an activity marking
228 Peace Memorial Day in southern Tainan County, after Chen
announced a day earlier that the National Unification Council (NUC)
would "cease to function" and its guidelines "cease to apply."</P>
      <P>Wang expressed the hope that Chen's government would better
handle cross-strait affairs by boosting communications and enhancing
exchanges of opinion with opposition parties and the international
community in order to maintain peace for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Commenting on an opposition lawmaker's proposal to introduce a
motion to recall President Chen over the NUC controversy at the
Legislative Yuan, Wang said that he must maintain neutrality
regarding the issue and deal with it in compliance with due process.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, opposition People First Party (PFP) spokesman Hsieh
Kung-ping said that the party will not rule out any measures or
activities to rein in Chen, including a mass street protest planned
by the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT). The KMT, the PFP and the New
Party form the "pan blue alliance," which controls the Legislative
Yuan by a slight majority.</P>
      <P>The PFP decided Monday to join the KMT in initiating the recall
motion at the Legislative Yuan, despite the fact that it will be very
difficult for the proposal to pass in the legislature due to the high
vote threshold, Hsieh said. But, he added that doing so would at
least serve the purpose of casting a "no-confidence" vote against
Chen for the public.</P>
      <P>Hsieh lashed out at Chen for seeking personal and political gains
and plotting Taiwan's de jure independence by rehashing the NUC issue,
putting national security and the people's welfare at stake.</P>
      <P>President Chen's NUC scheme has obviously undermined the
cross-strait status quo and goes against mainstream public opinion,
turning Taiwan into a target for criticism and plunging it into a
political crisis for breaching its promise of making no unilateral
changes to the cross-strait status quo, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Chen's fanning of cross-strait tension is unacceptable and his
attempts to stir up independence versus unification sentiments for
personal gain at the cost of the Taiwanese people's safety and
prosperity are deplorable, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan must maintain its status quo under the official title of
the Republic of China to keep peace across the strait, Hsieh
reiterated, adding that this means Taiwan will not declare formal
independence while Beijing will not use force against Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN APOLOGIZES OVER 228 INCIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  28 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou apologized Tuesday for the "wrongs and harm" committed by
the party in the 228 Incident 59 years ago, in which thousands of
people in Taiwan were massacred by KMT troops.</P>
      <P>Ma said the KMT cannot distance itself from an incident that
occurred under the KMT's administration.</P>
      <P>As the party's chairman, Ma said, he was willing to sincerely
acknowledge the party's fault in the incident and to apologize and
seek reconciliation with the victims' families, urging that ethnic
strife and division originating from the 228 Incident must not be
allowed to continue in the country.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while addressing the KMT's premiere of a
documentary on the incident, one of the party's events to mark the
59th anniversary of the tragedy sparked on Feb. 28, 1947.</P>
      <P>Ma said he has worked to redress the incident in the past, both
as former minister of justice and presently as Taipei mayor, and that
reconciliation efforts have continued after he took over KMT
chairmanship last year.</P>
      <P>In addition to measures such as former president Lee Teng-hui's
official apology and legislation offering compensation to victims'
families adopted by the KMT government in the 1990s, the KMT must
build a bridge of reconciliation with the families because "the way
the KMT dealt with the 228 Incident was indeed improper," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma stressed that the facts concerning the 228 Incident should be
made known to the public, especially to the younger generation, to
prevent similar tragedies from being repeated.</P>
      <P>The KMT must not be afraid of "washing its dirty linen in public"
or try to cover up its mistakes, he said.</P>
      <P>Also at the premiere, KMT Legislator John Chiang -- a grandson of
the late ROC President Chiang Kai-shek -- said he had always felt
apologetic to the victims of the 228 Incident and their families, and
had seized every opportunity to communicate with them in an effort to
heal wounds from the past.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the public should learn from the situation, and deal
with the incident with love and forgiveness.</P>
      <P>While Chiang admitted the KMT's responsibility for the suffering
caused to bereaved families, he said he could not accept accusations
made by some pro-Democratic Progressive Party historians that his
grandfather was a "prime culprit" in the 228 Incident.</P>
      <P>He was referring to an investigative report released Feb. 19 by
the 228 Memorial Foundation, which said that then president and KMT
head Chiang Kai-shek and then Taiwan Governor Chen Yi were the
masterminds of the bloody crackdown, because Chiang ordered troops to
be dispatched from China to "maintain order" in Taiwan because the
protests, which had spread from Taipei to other areas around the
island, were deemed "treasonous."</P>
      <P>The book contends the military crackdown against the uprising was
a criminal act committed by the KMT and that the current government
has the right to bring the former ruling party to justice.</P>
      <P>John Chiang filed a libel suit against the foundation's chairman
and the book's authors last week for what he called a serious
defamation of his grandfather's reputation.</P>

    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb. 28 (CNA)
(By Charles Kang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou has said he will convey the stance of what he described as
the "mainstream view" of Taiwan people to maintain the cross-Taiwan
Strait status quo to U.S. officials when he visits the United States
next month.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during an interview with the Lianhe Zaobao, a
Chinese-language newspaper in Singapore, which carried the interview
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>On President Chen Shui-bian's announcement a day earlier to
"cease the function" of the National Unification Council (NUC) , Ma
warned that Taiwan might be "too optimistic" if its damage assessment
is based on the initially, seemly relatively moderate response of
China and the United States to Chen's decision.</P>
      <P>Chen's decision has impacted the mutual trust between Taiwan and
the United States and has rocked the triangular strategic relations
between Taiwan, China and the United States, according to Ma.</P>
      <P>The decision has "driven Taiwan and the United States apart, but
pushed China and the United States closer, " Ma claimed, adding that
this is the price Taiwan has to pay in the long run.</P>
      <P>Ma said the most important role he and his allies in the
opposition camp can play is to express the voice of the "mainstream
view" of Taiwan and to arouse the concern of the international
community.</P>
      <P>He said that when he starts his visit to the United States March
19, he will communicate with the U.S. side and explain his party's
stance, which is that the mainstream view of Taiwan supports
"maintaining the status quo." He said he will also try to "mend
Taiwan-U.S. relations."</P>
      <P>On possible follow-up actions by China, Ma said that judging from
its remarks, Beijing seems to have defined Chen's move as "the first
step toward Taiwan independence."</P>
      <P>Ma said he assumed that Washington and Beijing are continuing
bilateral communication and that the developments of a meeting
between U.S. President George W. Bush and Chinese President Hu Jintao
in Washington in April will be a focus of attention.</P>
      <P>Although Chen's decision has thrown new uncertainty on
cross-strait relations, the KMT will follow an agreement reached
between former KMT Chairman Lien Chan and Hu when Lien visited China
in late April 2005 to continue to promote cross-strait peace and
prosperity, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma also said he has no plans to visit China in the near future.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A local Filipino party chapter voiced its
fierce opposition to embattled Philippine President Gloria Arroyo's
declaration of a state of emergency and called for Arroyo's ouster in
a protest Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Members of the Migrante Sectoral Party-Taiwan Chapter (MSP-TC)
and local human-rights activists staged the protest to accuse Arroyo
of corruption, election fraud, and failing to make the Philippines a
better country in front of the Manila Economic and Cultural Office
(MECO), the de facto embassy of the Philippines in Taiwan. The
group plans to return Sunday for another protest.</P>
      <P>Arroyo declared the state of emergency in a desperate move to
cling to power, said Gi Estrada, Taiwan Coordinator of the Asia
Pacific Mission for Migrants (APMM) and Secretary-General of the
MSP-TC.</P>
      <P>Aside from arresting military officers suspected of opposing the
Arroyo government, Arroyo has banned protests and started cracking
down on the opposition. According to the Philippine National Police,
there are more than 200 people who are to be arrested -- with or
without a warrant.</P>
      <P>"The state of emergency is essentially martial law, which gives
Arroyo the power to do whatever she wants," Estrada said, adding that
two congressmen -- Crispin Beltran and Joel Virador -- have
been arrested, and a newspaper, the Daily Tribune, was raided.</P>
      <P>"We are disappointed at the current government," said Gil
Lebria, who was among a dozen protesters holding cardboard signs
reading "Never again to Martial Law," "Oust GMA [Gloria
Macapagal-Arroyo], " and "Resist GMA's state of emergency."</P>
      <P>"The Taiwanese experienced the tragic '228' massacre on this very
day 59 years ago, and that's why we oppose any dictatorship or
tyranny. It's sad to know Filipinos are having to go through the
'White Terror' and martial law just like us," said Lennon Wong, Deputy
Director of the Department of International Relations, Chinese
Federation of Labour.</P>
      <P>Tang Shu, head of the Labor Rights Association's policy
department, urged the Philippine government to release the two
arrested congressmen.</P>
      <P>The Philippine government should immediately stop suppressing
human rights groups, said Chen Jau-hua, a Philosophy professor at
Soochow University. Chen estimated that more than 4,000 human-rights
activists were killed in the Philippines last year.</P>
      <P>Gloria Arroyo declared the state of emergency in Philippines on

      <P>Beijing's response toward President Chen
Shui-bian's move regarding the National Unification Council (NUC) was
predictable and reflects a lack of understanding by Beijing of
Taiwan's democracy, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu
said Tuesday.</P>

its guidelines is aimed at solidifying Taiwan's democracy and

of his decision to cease the NUC's operations as "playing with
words." No matter whether Chen's intention was to "scrap" or
"terminate" the NUC, he is attempting to fan Taiwan independence, the
statement said.</P>
      <P>Judging from Beijing's negative reaction, it is obvious that
Beijing does not understand Taiwan and its democratic system, Wu
claimed, adding that Beijing might commit more "wrongdoing" if it
fails to better understand Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As an independent sovereignty, the 23 million people of Taiwan
are the ones to determine the country's future, and Beijing's
sovereignty claim over Taiwan goes against the reality that Taiwan
and China are ruled by separate governments, Wu pointed out.</P>
      <P>Wu called public attention to the fact that Beijing is to blame
for altering the cross-strait status quo, as it has long tried to
squeeze out Taiwan of the international community and to use force
against Taiwan by deploying more than 700 missiles aimed at the
nation.</P>
      <P>To effectively resolve cross-strait disputes, the only solution
is to hold government-to-government negotiations between the two
sides, Wu said, calling on Beijing to re-open talks with Taiwan on
issues related to Chinese tourists coming to Taiwan and setting up
direct cross-strait passenger and cargo charter flight services.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is willing to conduct negotiations with China under the
principles of sovereignty, peace, reciprocity and democracy, " he
added.</P>
      <P>As to a planned visit by former U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
Richard Armitage to Taiwan in early-March, Wu claimed that the visit
is unrelated to the NUC issue but added that it should help further
enhance mutual understanding to forge greater common ground to serve
the interests of Taiwan and the United States.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has had a full exchange of views with the United States
about the NUC issue and Washington understands Taiwan's stance, he
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>USE OF MAGNETIC STRIP CARDS RESTRICTED TO ATM AT ORIGINAL ISSUERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 28 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC)
reminded consumers on Tuesday that from March 1, magnetic strip cards
for automatic teller machines (ATMs) will be no longer effective on
all existing ATMs, but only those set up by the original card issuer.</P>
      <P>The use of ATM magnetic-strip cards will be restricted to
functions of cash withdrawal, account checks, taxes and other
payments, as well as account transfers to the card issuer and other
banks, on the ATMs installed by the card issuer.</P>
      <P>For example, if a certain bank has 38 ATMs around the country,
holders of the bank's ATM magnetic cards are allowed to make
transactions only on those 38 machines, but not on the other 23,967
ATMs set up by other banks.</P>
      <P>The FSC has encouraged cardholders to exchange the magnetic card
for an integrated circuit (IC) card as soon as possible out of
convenience and safety concerns. The ATM IC cards combine cash
withdrawal, credit, cash advances and smart debit features on one
card, and operate in a more secure transaction environment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HAS NOT LEARNED LESSON FROM 228 INCIDENT: FORMER DPP HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 28 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's future is not bright despite the
many political changes the nation has gone through, because its
society still has not learned the lessons or acquired wisdom from the
Feb. 28 incident of 1947, a former chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Yi-hsiung, who served as DPP chairman from 1998-2000, made
the remarks at a memorial gathering held at his family's cemetery in
Ilan County to honor the memory of his mother and two twin daughters,
murdered Feb. 28, 1980 while he was being tried by a military court
for the role he played in the Kaohsiung Incident of 1979.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung Incident occurred Dec. 10, 1979 after a
demonstration organized by leaders of the then-opposition DPP and
Formosa magazine to mark Human Rights Day became violent and injuried
many unarmed military police personnel. Lin and seven other prominent
leaders of the DPP were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 12
years to life imprisonment.</P>
      <P>The cemetery of the Lin family was completed five years after the
triple murder, which has remained a mystery. Lin and many of his
supporters come to the cemetery Feb. 28 every year for a memorial
gathering.</P>
      <P>More than 100 people joined Lin Tuesday to mark the 26th
anniversary of the deaths.</P>
      <P>Lin said he added some more activities to make this year's
memorial more meaningful, including inviting participants to draw
pictures, give speeches, recite poems, learn gardening and mourn for
those who died in the clampdown after the 228 Incident of 1947.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that all those who took part in the
memorial and the next generation will learn the wisdom to avoid
similar tragedies from happening again.</P>
      <P>He also encouraged all those who might take part in next year's
memorial to fast for the day and ponder on what lessons they could
learn from the 228 Incident, so that they can plan for the future and
pass good culture to their children.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident of 1947 was sparked by a skirmish in which
Monopoly Bureau officials who tried to confiscate smuggled cigarettes
in Taipei caused the injury of a woman vendor and the death of an
innocent bystander, prompting mass demonstrations and clashes all
over Taiwan between locals and mainland Chinese. Troops from China
moved into Taiwan March 8 and began a brutal crackdown that resulted
in the deaths of some 30,000 people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>228 INCIDENT 'ANTI-DEMOCRACY, ANTI-HUMAN RIGHTS': PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 28 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian Tuesday called the
228 Incident of 1947, in which thousands of people in Taiwan were
massacred by then-ruling Kuomintang (KMT) troops, an incident against
"democracy, human rights and humanity."</P>
      <P>Chen said the incident was totally unrecognized during the
authoritarian rule dominated by the KMT and that after he took over
the presidency in 2000, he felt that it was not enough for the
government to try only to make amends to the families of the victims
because they also have the absolute right to know who were the
culprits behind the bloody crackdown.</P>
      <P>During the course of the country trying to restore the truth of
the incident over the past 20 years, "some people" have attempted to
"play down, distort and even fake" the historical significance of the
228 Incident by simplifying it as a rebellion against a corrupt
government, Chen alleged.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed this account is totally unfactual and is "false
history" created for specific political purposes.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the 228 Incident was a systematic, organized
suppression of Taiwan's elite by an "alien," authoritarian regime.</P>
      <P>It was persecution of the people of Taiwan by an individual and
political party for selfish purposes, he said.</P>
      <P>While the brutalities of the 228 Incident can be forgiven, the
truth of the incident must not be left uninvestigated or forgotten,
Chen said, adding that the truth must be uncovered to uphold justice
and prevent similar tragedies from being repeated.</P>
      <P>He said 16 volumes of declassified files published by the
Academia Historica provide the public with access to the historical
truth.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while addressing a ceremony held
at the 228 Peace Memorial Park in Taipei to commemorate the 59th
anniversary of the incident.</P>
      <P>Also addressing the ceremony, Premier Su Tseng-chang said the 228
Incident is the worst tragedy to have occurred in Taiwan
and the deepest wound to have been suffered by its people.</P>
      <P>As part of the country's steps to mourn and remember the innocent
victims of the incident, Su noted, the Cabinet decided Monday that
the national flag should fly at half mast every year on Feb. 28,
which is observed as Peace Memorial Day.</P>
      <P>Su said he was still in his mother's womb when the incident
occurred 59 years ago and that his mother had to climb over a wall to
sneak out for prenatal examinations because martial law had been
declared.</P>
      <P>Su said that throughout his life he heard many similar stories
and a lot of other stories about the injustice and persecution
perpetrated by the then-KMT government to the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Echoing the president's view, Su said that only if the historical
truth is uncovered will the county be able to move
forward.</P>
      <P>An investigative report released Feb. 19 by the 228 Memorial
Foundation identified then-President and KMT Chairman Chiang Kai-shek
and then-Taiwan Governor Chen Yi as the masterminds behind the bloody
crackdown, saying that Chiang ordered troops to be dispatched from
China to "maintain order" in Taiwan because the protests, which had
spread from Taipei to other areas around the island, were deemed
"treasonous."</P>
      <P>The book contends that the military crackdown against the
uprising was a criminal act committed by the KMT and that the current
government has the right to bring the former ruling party to justice.</P>

The chaos in Darfur, the war-ravaged region in Sudan where more

into Chad, deepening one of the world's worst refugee crises. Arab
gunmen from Darfur have pushed across the desert and entered Chad,
stealing cattle, burning crops and killing anyone who resists. The
lawlessness has driven at least 20,000 Chadians from their homes,
making them refugees in their own country. Hundreds of thousands more

Wall Street Journal: Explosive Test, Bush's India Visit
Spotlights Hurdles In Nuclear Deal

U.S. President Bush threw out the rulebook last summer when he

agreed to sell civil nuclear technology to India, which has

been an outcast for three decades for covertly developing a

weapons program. Bush argued that India deserved to be brought

in from the cold. In exchange India, which has never signed the

1970 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, agreed that it would

start playing by at least some of the world's nuclear rules.

The two governments have been wrangling over what they really

agreed to since that day.</TEXT>

      <P>With a national holiday Tuesday in memory
of the 228 Incident of 59 years ago, a long-time American resident of
Taiwan said young people need to learn more about the tragedy in
Taiwan's history, just as Europeans do with the Holocaust.</P>
      <P>"Young people in Taiwan do not have a clear idea of what the
event was about and more lessons have to be taught to the young

more about it, they will love the place they live in even more, " he
said.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident refers to a series of events that started Feb.
28, 1947 when a woman tobacco peddler was arrested for selling
smuggled cigarettes. It led to a series of riots and a
brutal crackdown by the then-Kuomingtang government that resulted in
the murder of around 30,000 people.</P>
      <P>Jerry Walter, a Canadian living in Taiwan who works for local

distributing compensation money, " Walter said. But he added that the

    <HEADLINE>DPP URGES KMT NOT TO INITIATE MOTION TO RECALL PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  28 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) urged the legislative caucus of the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Tuesday not to introduce a motion in the Legislative Yuan that
would seek to recall President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Tsai Huang-liang said Chen has done nothing wrong
in "ceasing the functions" of the National Unification Council (NUC)
and that the KMT will be challenging the Taiwan people if it sponsors
the motion demanding his recall.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the motion is unlikely to succeed and claimed it will
only be despised by the people.</P>
      <P>William Lai, a DPP legislative caucus whip, claimed that such a
motion would only escalate the confrontation between the ruling and
opposition parties, destroy social stability and hurt Taiwan's
overall interests.</P>
      <P>Urging the KMT to call off the plan, Lai said KMT Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou should "halt the horse before it plunges down the cliff."</P>
      <P>Tuan Yi-kang, a former convener of the DPP's New Tide Faction,
said that if the consequences of scrapping the NUC are as serious as
the KMT has claimed, then the motion for Chen's recall will become a
"farce" that might make Taiwan's already grim situation even worse.</P>
      <P>The DPP heavyweights issued the warnings after Ma reiterated
Tuesday that the KMT will work with other opposition parties to push
the motion through the legislature, although he acknowledged that the
chances of its passage are very slim.</P>
      <P>Ma said the KMT's purpose in introducing the motion is to express
strong dissatisfaction on behalf of the people with the president's
disregard of their difficult living conditions.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Kung-pin, spokesman for the opposition People First Party
(PFP) -- the KMT's partner in the "pan-blue alliance" -- said the PFP
will support the KMT's motion and any other measures by the
opposition to counter Chen's move to scrap the NUC.</P>
      <P>Hsieh added that although the motion is unlikely to pass the
legislature because of the high vote threshold required, it will send
a signal that Taiwan's mainstream public opinion does not approve of
Chen's behavior.</P>
      <P>According to the Constitution, one-fourth of the members of the
Legislative Yuan are needed to sponsor a motion to recall the
president. The motion will have to be approved by two-thirds of the
legislators before the case can be determined through a national
referendum. In addition, in order to make the referendum result
effective, more than half of the nation's voters must vote in the
referendum and more than half of the votes cast must favor the
recall.</P>

      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang will
organize a march in Taipei March 12 to protest President Chen
Shui-bian's decision to end the National Unification Council (NUC) and
its guidelines.</P>
      <P>The KMT, which set up the council in 1991, was originally to have
staged a rally March 19 to observe the anniversary of Chen's shooting
in 2004, which the party claims was a political plot staged to help
Chen to win re-election in the March 20, 2004 presidential election,
but decided to move it forward after Chen announced the end of the
NUC.</P>
      <P>The protest will appeal for public support with calls for a stop

independence or eventual unification with China and concentration on
improving people's livelihoods.</P>
