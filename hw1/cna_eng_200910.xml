      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) formally opened its Digital Content
Industry Promotion Office Tuesday as a first step in an ambitious plan to
develop Taiwan as a global digital publication center.</P>
      <P>Presiding over the inauguration ceremony, Chou Neng-chuan, deputy director-
general of the MOEA Industrial Development Bureau, described the office as a hub
from which efforts will be made to promote and expand the digital content
industry in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The bureau has decided to spend NT$3.885 billion (US$121 million) over the next
five years to develop the digital content sector, a goal that is listed as one
of the government's flagship projects within the cultural creative industry,
Chou said.</P>
      <P>He said one of the office's first tasks will be to establish at least two
trading centers for Chinese-language electronic books by the year 2013. It will
also seek to develop at least 10 creative technology applications related to
reading and will aim for local content on electronic reading devices to be
increased to at least 80 percent of the total, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chou said, over the next five years, the center will make efforts to
publish and market 100,000 copies of Chinese-language e-books, attract NT$10
billion-worth investment in the digital publishing industry, increase the
digital reading population to 1 million, and expand the production value of the
digital publishing sector to NT$100 billion by 2013.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Shih Hsin University will launch a master's credit cohort program in
Shanghai at the end of October, targeting  Taiwanese  businessmen  in China,
the  university's representative in Shanghai said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The program is aimed at providing an opportunity for Taiwanese investors and
employees in China to pursue advanced studies in communication management,
according to Shen Tsung-nan, deputy head of the Shanghai-based Shih Hsin
Extension Education Institute which will host the classes.</P>
      <P>In the initial stage, the program will be offered to 30 students and the classes
will be held one weekend a month starting Oct. 31, Shen said.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the program is to provide a fast track for China-based Taiwanese
to obtain a master's degree from the university, according to Shen.</P>
      <P>He said the university will apply to the Ministry of Education (MOE) at the end
of October to allow graduate credit hours earned in Shanghai to be counted
toward a master's degree. The MOE's decision will be released around late
January, he added.</P>
      <P>Currently, under Taiwan's education regulations, credits earned outside the
country cannot be counted towards a graduate degree in Taiwan schools, Shen
noted.</P>
      <P>The courses to be offered at the institute are those for which credits are most
commonly transferred, he said. They include organization theory and management,
communication theory, media marketing and management, and human resource
management in the media.</P>
      <P>At the start of the program, the Taiwanese students will be enrolled in two
classes -- organization and management, and communication theory, according to
Shen.</P>
      <P>According  to Peng  Si-zhou,  head  of the Department  of International
Business, Taipei College of Maritime Technology, there is high demand among
Taiwanese businessmen in China for further study opportunities to enhance their
knowledge, particularly in the areas of cultural and creative industry and the
service sector.</P>
      <P>Besides, in the short term, offering classes to Taiwanese across the strait is a
good way for private universities to expand business, Peng said, noting that
there are about 1 million Taiwanese based in China.</P>

      <P>A spokesman for the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Wednesday that it
will not send any representative to attend China's 60th national day
celebrations or other relevant activities in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Ma Shao-chang, SEF deputy secretary general, was responding to questions on
whether SEF Vice Chairman Rock Hsu is among the some 150 Taiwan figures who have
accepted Beijing's invitation to attend China's 60th national day celebrations
on Oct. 1.</P>
      <P>The SEF is a semi-official agency authorized by the government to handle
exchanges with China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS) in the absence of official contact between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Ma said that Hsu, chairman of the Kinpo Group, will take part in the event in a
personal capacity, and his planned participation has nothing to do with the SEF
or any other official agency in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma added that Hsu is one of the private sector representatives on the SEF's
board of directors and is therefore not obliged to obtain SEF approval for
travel to Beijing for any purpose.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)  Chairwoman  Lai Shin-yuan said while
the government has no legal power to forbid any private individual from
attending the Beijing celebrations, Hsu, who is now in Beijing, should think
twice before he decides to do so and should "keep public sentiment in mind."</P>

      <P>Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) fired one its station superintendents
Wednesday after it was found that the person had been engaged in profiteering at
the expense of the company, officials said.</P>
      <P>In addition, 24 employees were disciplined for using insider knowledge to snag
personal profits, THRSC officials said, adding that this was the company's first
round of disciplinary action against dishonest workers.</P>
      <P>The debt-ridden high speed railway company confirmed earlier in the day that 98
employees, mostly station staff, were suspected of hurting the company's
interests by taking advantage of their position to make profits.</P>
      <P>The 25 employees were found to have stocked up on "buy four get one free" group
tickets, based on insider knowledge that the company would cancel train services
during Typhoon Morakot in early August.</P>
      <P>Those employees cashed in on the company's refund policy and its compensatory
free voucher offers to ticket holders when services were canceled during the
storm, the THSRC disclosed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, another 73 employees are still being questioned about their suspected
attempts to make money from a promotional Father's Day offer last month.</P>
      <P>Under the "88 program" launched Aug. 8 on Father's Day, holders of tickets with
serial numbers ending with 88 were entitled to vouchers for half-price tickets
valid for Aug. 7-9. But because trains were canceled on those two day due to
Typhoon Morakot, only a few people eventually got the half-price coupons.</P>
      <P>It was found that a large number of THSRC employees had kept the tickets with
the '88' serial numbers for themselves, officials of the company said, adding
that a second round of punishment will be handed out when the interrogation
process is completed.</P>
      <P>The supervisors of those dishonest employees will also be disciplined for poor
management, the officials added.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, THSRC Chairman Ou Chin-der expressed regret over the
incidents, saying that he considers honor and discipline among employees as top
priority.</P>
      <P>The cases have prompted the company to review its ticketing system, said Ou, who
assumed chairmanship of the THRSC last week after Nita Ing resigned from the
position.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Pregnant A(H1N1) patient who lost her baby recovers</HEADLINE>

      <P>A woman who was discharged from hospital Wednesday after recovering from a
serious case of influenza A(H1N1) said "it is good to be alive", although she
lost her baby in her sixth month of pregnancy.</P>
      <P>The 25-year-old woman, surnamed Chen, was the first pregnant A(H1N1) patient
recorded in Taiwan. She was transferred from Pingtung County to Kaohsiung
Veterans General Hospital (KVGH) in Kaohsiung City, southern Taiwan, on Aug. 13
after she developed symptoms of pneumonia.</P>
      <P>KVGH Vice President Huang Jung-ching said that when the patient arrived at the
hospital she was having difficulty breathing. She was given the antiviral drug
Tamiflu and placed on the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) system, he
said, adding that they were the key treatments that saved the woman's life.</P>
      <P>However, it is regrettable that she lost the baby, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Chen said she had no idea of how she contracted the H1N1 virus. She advised that
pregnant women who contract A(H1N1), also known as swine flu, should stick to
the doctors' treatment, despite concerns over Tamiflu's side effects.</P>
      <P>The Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) reported Wednesday that seven more
patients had been hospitalized in Taiwan for severe H1N1 symptoms in the
previous  24 hours,  bringing the total number of hospitalized cases since the
outbreak began to 305.</P>
      <P>Of that number, 18 had died, 30 were still being treated in hospitals, while the
other 257 had been discharged.</P>
      <P>The fatalities included one woman who died two days after giving birth to a baby
boy and another who was pregnant and declined to take Tamiflu.</P>
      <P>A CECC official said Sunday that the swine flu outbreak is on the downswing in
Taiwan and the percentage of people being hospitalized with the virus had
clearly declined.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Preserving traditional art form, old master keeps 'em laughing</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/01/09  10:47:58</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Donning the costume of a clown and employing vulgar yet vivid Taiwanese dialect,
78-year-old Shih Chao-yang leads his family in performing a local wordplay act
known asChe-gu Changthat always has the audience holding their sides with
laughter.</P>
      <P>Che-gu Chang meanscart and drums arrayin Chinese.No one can explain why it is so
named, but it is one of the earliest forms of folk entertainment in Taiwan,
usually performed by at least two men, one dressed up in drag as a young lady,
and the other as a clown.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by a band of three to nine stringed instruments, they act out folk
tales, historical legends and stories from literature.</P>
      <P>Theyoung ladycatches the audience's eyes during the play, but it is the clown
whose funny acting and interesting dialogue with the young lady makes people
burst into laughter.</P>
      <P>The plays can be staged anywhere from a lobby to an outdoor square in front of a
temple and sometimes even on a makeshift stage made from an ox cart.</P>
      <P>Having been involved in this form of entertainment for more than six decades,
Shih, who comes from Homei in Changhua County, has been dubbed a national
treasure.</P>
      <P>In the past, farmers learned to perform Che-gu Chang simply for recreation after
the harvest, when they did not have to tend their crops,Shih said.</P>
      <P>Shih's troupe was at its busiest during the Chinese New Year holiday, and
especially during the Lantern Festival, as local temples would invite the group
to perform along with other similar troupes.</P>
      <P>In order to attract the biggest audiences, each troupe would call all their
skills into play and would sometimes even send people to disrupt the pitches of
the other troupes.</P>
      <P>The competition among the different troupes was so intense that it often
prompted squabbles and police or local officials would have to be called in to
keep order,Shih recalled.</P>
      <P>Shih learned his craft as a teenager from his father, who was a Che-gu Chang
performer in his village.</P>
      <P>The young Shih's performances became well-known around Homei by the time he was
15, and he was often asked to perform at local theaters as a professional
entertainer, where he took great enjoyment in making his audiences roll in the
aisles.</P>
      <P>Public address systems were unheard of at that time, so the players would have
to pitch their voices to allow the audiences to hear them.This took its toll on
Shih, as his voice had not yet broken, so his father sent him to work in Taipei
so that he would not damage his throat.</P>
      <P>Rather that dousing his enthusiasm for his craft, however, absence made him even
more passionate about it, and when he returned to Homei several years later, he
performed Che-gu Chang as a hobby while working on his inherited farmland.</P>
      <P>It was at that time that Shih began to realize his routines had to keep abreast
with the changing times to attract audiences.</P>
      <P>I began to write new plays with new scripts that were more relevant to people's
daily lives and more appealing to audiences,he said.</P>
      <P>Following the old tradition, Shih's scripts were written in phrases of either
four or seven words, with amusing lines and rhymes designed to rouse the
audience's interest.</P>
      <P>The writing process was quite difficult for him, because he only attended
elementary school for a few years when Taiwan was ruled by Japan and could
hardly read or write Chinese characters.</P>
      <P>Because of this, he had to work out the plots in his mind and dictate them to a
transcriber who would write them, polish them and then read them back to him.If
he thought the dialogues were not appropriate, he would suggest changes until
they were perfect.</P>
      <P>Finally, he would then have to commit them to memory so that he could rattle
them off on stage without thinking.</P>
      <P>Although his plays are represented in simple language because of his virtual
illiteracy, they provide in-depth descriptions of the common people's ordinary
lives, thanks to his insightful observations and rich life experience.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, a perfect Che-gu Chang performance combines a good script,
including an entertaining epilogue and dialogue, funny yet graceful acting, and
beautiful voices that are capable of expressing various human emotions.</P>
      <P>His marvelous performances and unique skills brought him to the attention of the
Changhua County government, which invited him to teach his trade at local
elementary schools -- which he has done since 1983 -- to introduce the folk art
to young people.</P>
      <P>In 1988, Shih formed his own troupe, consisting of his two sons, two daughters-
in-law and several female relatives.</P>
      <P>At its peak, Shih's troupe gave 30 to 40 performances a month at local temples,
weddings and funerals.</P>
      <P>However, Che-gu Chang can no longer rival modern entertainment forms, and Shih
is satisfied these days if his troupe can give 10 performances a month.</P>
      <P>Without audiences, no form of art can thrive,Shih said.</P>
      <P>I do feel sorry for the fading away of this aspect of life, but Iam thankful
that I have been able to make a living for 18 years with this hobby and that I
have been able to entertain so many people by sharing with them what I really
love,he said.</P>
      <P>It would be an unexpected windfall for me if any student to whom I introduced
Che-gu Chang is motivated enough to carry the torch and revive the art.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Swine flu, officially known as influenza A (H1N1), has claimed the life of a
woman in Taoyuan County, the first fatality in the northern county since the
outbreak began, the Taoyuan Public Health Bureau reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>The victim, the 19th in Taiwan, was a 24-year-old woman who suffered from funnel
chest, a congenital deformity that causes cardiac and respiratory problems and
requires the administration of oxygen when the patient is asleep.</P>
      <P>The woman was hospitalized Sept. 26 with asthma and other flu symptoms and on
Sept. 28 she tested positive for the A(H1N1) virus. She  received  intubation
and  ECMO  (extracorporeal  membrane oxygenation) treatment Sept. 29, but died
later that day, according to the Taoyuan Health Bureau.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) reported Thursday that one
more patient had been hospitalized with the H1N1 virus as the new flu strain
continued to spread throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The newly hospitalized patient was a 19-year-old male from Taipei County.</P>
      <P>The case brought the total number of H1N1 hospitalized patients to 306 since the
outbreak began, the CECC said.</P>
      <P>Nineteen of these patients have died, while 261 have recovered and 26 others
remain in hospital, the CECC said.</P>
      <P>A CECC official said Thursday that the swine flu outbreak is on the downswing in
Taiwan as the rate of people being hospitalized with the H1N1 virus had clearly
declined and the number has remained under 30 over the past week.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's first 'living price index' to be published Oct. 5</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's first "living price index", which will measure fluctuations in the
price of consumer goods and factor in people's opinions of such changes, will be
published on Oct. 5, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The new cost-of-living index will reflect the price of water, electricity,
domestic gas, food and transportation services, among other items. It will be
published on a monthly basis to serve as a reference for administrative
policies, said DGBAS Minister Shih Su-mei while answering questions in the
legislature's Finance Committee.</P>
      <P>Explaining the difference between the existing consumer price index (CPI) and
the new living price index, Shih said that the CPI is an average weighted index
comprised of 424 items in seven categories, and it measures differences in the
price of goods and services. However, the new living price index will place a
higher value on peoples' feelings about commodity price fluctuations, Shih said.</P>
      <P>The new so-called "CPI-living necessaries" will be divided into three
categories, with food, housing (water, electricity and gas) and transportation
(fuel) in category A, and education and entertainment in category B, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Category C will be more extensive, covering the prices of food and clothing as
well as other items that fall under the housing segment such as water,
electricity, domestic gas, transportation, household maintenance services, daily
cleaning supplies, and cable TV fees, Shih added.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu instructed the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) earlier in September to work out a "living price index" that
would reflect people's feelings about commodity price fluctuations. Chu said the
government should talk about economic  performance  "in a way that most people
can understand."</P>

      <P>Led by strong gains in banking and financial shares, Taiwan's share prices
closed higher Thursday, with the weighted index, the market's key barometer,
rising 36.12 points, or 0.48 percent, to close at 7,545.29.</P>
      <P>With the hope that Taiwan and mainland China will soon sign a memorandum of
understanding (MOU) on cross-strait banking, the local bourse opened higher at
7,581.38 and reached a new 2009 high of 7,599.62. However, it failed to break
the 7,600 level as electronics shares consolidated recent gains, causing the
index to reverse gains at one point and reach the day's low of 7,492.62.</P>
      <P>A total of 49.6 billion shares changed hands on market turnover of NT$135.33
billion (US$4.2 billion), up from NT$125.24 billion the previous day.</P>
      <P>Four of the eight major stock categories gained ground, with banking and
financial shares moving up the most at 2.32 percent. Textile stocks advanced
1.92 percent, cement stocks gained 1.77 percent, and plastics and chemicals
shares added 0.98 percent.</P>
      <P>Food shares dropped 1.01 percent, paper and pulp issues lost 0.8 percent,
constructions issues were down 0.29 percent, and machinery and electronics

      <P>Losers outnumbered gainers 1,288 to 1,178, with 207 stocks remaining unchanged.</P>
      <P>Foreign institutional investors, the major driving force behind the recent
market gains, were net buyers of NT$10.08 billion-worth of shares for the day,
compared with NT$12.58 billion the previous day. The net worth of shares bought
by foreign institutional investors in September was NT$144.2 billion, which

    <HEADLINE>Long lines as Taiwan kicks off 2009 vaccinations for seasonal flu</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hundreds of people lined up outside a hospital in Taipei to be vaccinated for
seasonal flu Thursday as Taiwan kicked off the year's flu-prevention campaign
amid fears of the spread of the flu, as well as swine flu.</P>
      <P>As of 11: 30 a.m., 900 people had received a number from the Taipei Veterans
General Hospital to get a vaccination for the seasonal flu as the peak flu
season is setting in for seasonal flu, as well as swine flu, officially known as
influenza A(H1N1) , according to hospital authorities.</P>
      <P>In the southern port city of Kaohsiung, residents also began to receive seasonal
flu vaccinations Thursday at over 200 health institutions contracted with the
city government.</P>
      <P>Long lines were also formed at hospitals in central Taiwan's Taichung City.</P>
      <P>A total of 245 hospitals and clinics in Taichung were opened to vaccine
receivers. An estimated 120,000 people in the central city are expected to
benefit from the flu-prevention drive.</P>
      <P>Health officials attributed the "booming business" mainly to mounting threats
posed by not just seasonal flu, but also the new A(H1N1) flu.</P>
      <P>As of Thursday, the number of people hospitalized for H1N1 had reached 306 in
Taiwan, since the outbreak began earlier this year. Nineteen of these patients
have died, while 261 have recovered and 26 others remain in hospital. But health
officials said the outbreak is on the downswing as the rate of people being
hospitalized had declined.</P>
      <P>Across Taiwan, the seasonal flu vaccines will be given nationwide in order of
priority to elderly people aged 65 and above, medical personnel in charge of
disease control and prevention, poultry breeders, and patients with rare or
serious diseases, followed by children aged between 6 to 10 months, and Typhoon
Morakot victims living in temporary houses or shelters.</P>
      <P>Vaccines for H1N1 flu are expected to be distributed to Taiwan's public in early
November at the earliest, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).</P>
      <P>The H1N1 vaccines will be distributed according to a different order of priority
-- with typhoon-affected people and medical personnel in charge of disease
control and prevention first in line, then pregnant women, followed by pre-
school children, seriously ill patients,  and elementary, junior high and senior
high school students, CDC officials said.</P>
      <P>Further down on the priority list will be individuals aged between 50 and 64,
healthy people in the 25-49 age group, those aged over 25 at high risk of
cardiopulmonary disease, and those in the 19-24 age bracket.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, entertainer-turned-lifetime anti-smoking volunteer campaigner Sun
Yueh was one of the first citizens in the country to receive the inoculation for
the seasonal flu on the first day of the drive.</P>
      <P>Sun urged citizens who are on a priority  list for free inoculations against
seasonal flu to waste no time to receive the vaccine at hospitals or their local
health offices as autumn draws near. The flu season starts in autumn and
continues throughout the winter till early next year.</P>
      <P>Sun also advised people to wear face masks in public places, wash their hands
often and refrain from shaking hands.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said at a Cabinet meeting Thursday that cross-strait economic
cooperation should be expanded on a trial basis.</P>
      <P>Wu made the comment after listening to a Ministry of Economic Affairs report on
"the bridging project -- current and future industrial cooperation between
Taiwan and the mainland," according to Su Jun-pin, minister in charge of the
Government Information Office, at a press briefing after the Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>Wu said that as Taiwan has the advantage in R&amp;D, production and business
management, the current one-way investments in China by Taiwan businessmen
should be gradually addressed after the normalization of cross-strait economic
exchanges and cooperation.</P>
      <P>To make Taiwan more attractive to investors from mainland China and the rest of
the world, the relevant government agencies should redouble their efforts to
improve Taiwan's investment climate, as this would help to boost economic growth
and employment, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Su said the MOEA, under its "bridging project," listed Chinese herbal medicine,
solar power, automotive communications, information, LED and wind-power
generation as the areas in which Taiwan and China could pursue joint
development.</P>
      <P>He added that 18 letters of intent involving some 80 enterprises, mostly in the
above-mentioned industries on both sides of the strait, have been signed to
facilitate future cooperation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) unveiled Thursday new types
of hydrogen powered battery chargers for cell phones, that their inventor said
will set a new trend in battery use across the world.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference marking the release of the highly -efficient and
energy-effective new devices, Yeh Hui-ching, director of the Bureau of Energy
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, announced the arrival of a new era of
hydrogen energy and gave the government's full endorsement for the local
hydrogen fuel cell sector.</P>
      <P>"The government hopes to acquire a slot in the global green energy industry's
production chain with the hydrogen fuel cell technologies, and it seeks to make
the sector's key expertise a local content by 2012 and begin commercial
production as soon as possible," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>One eye-catching item among the newly created devices displayed in the news
conference was an electricity ball, which is capable of releasing hydrogen after
charging water into it, and the hydrogen powered device can serve as a battery
charger for cell phones.</P>
      <P>The electricity ball can be fully charged with hydrogen power in only two hours,
allowing cell phones to get electricity unplugged, said Shueh Chan-li, a
researcher at the ITRI's Energy and Environment Research Laboratories.</P>
      <P>According to Shueh, the institute has led other countries in using hydrogen
power to develop battery chargers for cell phones. He expressed the belief that
the hydrogen powered electricity ball could be popularized following its mass
production that is set to reduce its cost. Currently, a handset of such a fuel
battery charger costs NT$500 (US$15.52).</P>
      <P>Two other new kinds of hydrogen powered fuel batteries were also on display in
the news conference. One can allow vehicles to be driven faster than a
motorcycle with a speed of more than 80 kilometers per hour, while the other can
serve as an uninterrupted power supply equipment for companies.</P>

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials
Thursday:</P>
      <P>Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>Debunking the myths surrounding Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp.</P>
      <P>We have to debunk the myths about the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp (THRSC).</P>
      <P>Myth  one,  the  railway  system  was  built  under  the Build-Operate-Transfer
model. The fact is 92 percent of the project's funding came from the government.</P>
      <P>Myth two, the railway system is not profitable. The fact is it recorded a pre-
tax profit of NT$11.6 billion, or 50.4 percent of its revenue, in 2008. But the
profit was wiped out by debt servicing and depreciation.</P>
      <P>Myth three, the government has no legal power to regulate the corporation. The
fact is the government has been closely involved in the management of the
corporation from its inception.</P>
      <P>We hope the company will be managed in the following ways:</P>
      <P>First, the government should not force the consortium of banks to give the
company extraordinary concessions in the rescheduling of its debts.</P>
      <P>Second, THRSC should be operated as a quasi-state company now that the
government has stepped in to reschedule its debts.</P>
      <P>Third, an ad hoc committee comprised of members of the the general public should
be set up to monitor the company's operations.</P>
      <P>Fourth, the owners of the company should not be permitted to lease the rights to
develop property adjacent to the company's stations.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Was 1949 a blessing or a disaster for Taiwan?</P>
      <P>Taiwan and mainland China have been ruled by different regimes since 1949. That
year was considered by some as a disaster for Taiwan because it catapulted the
island into the hands of alien rulers. But for others, it was seen as a blessing
because it sheltered Taiwan from the rule of the Chinese Communists.</P>
      <P>As a result, Taiwan developed into the first democracy among Chinese communities
worldwide and it has become a prosperous society, which has enabled it to
negotiate on equal terms with Beijing for peaceful co-existence.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's development has not been smooth -- having</P>
      <P>undergone the ordeal of the 228 Incident and the white terror era</P>
      <P>-- its challenges pale in comparison with the ordeals the Chinese</P>
      <P>people have experienced in the last six decades.</P>
      <P>Our view is that 1949 was more a blessing than a disaster for Taiwan, as the
island developed from that point into a political model that Beijing can
emulate.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Are the authorities trying to sell out Taiwan?</P>
      <P>Economics Minister Shih Yen-shiang told the Legislative Yuan Tuesday that his
ministry is trying to work out a plan by the end of this year to ease
restrictions on investments in China by local flat panel manufacturers and wafer
foundries.</P>
      <P>The flat panel and wafer industries in Taiwan were both developed with special
aid from the government, and if they are allowed to invest in China, this will
sap Taiwan's economic strength.</P>
      <P>The Ma administration is negotiating with China on an economic cooperation
framework agreement which will open Taiwan's market to Chinese products at the
expense of local industries, and the administration's  decision  to allow the
flat panel and wafer industries to invest in China is nothing less than a sell
out that will cost Taiwan its economic lifeline.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>President has no right to choose losing over winning for fear of owing the devil</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang's (KMT's) losses in the referendum on gambling in Penghu
County and in the legislative by-election in Yunlin County had prompted some of
President Ma Ying-jeou's followers to claim that he would opt for losses rather
than rub elbows with political villains.</P>
      <P>But we have to say that the president has no right to make such a decision.</P>
      <P>Sticking to principle is not always a virtue in politics. All great leaders in
history know how to get down in the dirt while struggling to realize their goals
step by step.</P>
      <P>Who else can the people rely on for reform if Ma, as head of state and of the
ruling party, cannot help them realize their hopes for a better future?</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that it has expressed
condolences to Indonesia and Samoa, which suffered heavy loss of life in two
separate major earthquakes the previous day.</P>
      <P>"We contacted our representative offices in those two countries immediately
after learning about the quakes and asked them to convey our condolences and
sympathy to the respective governments," said MOFA deputy spokesman James Chang
at a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>"The two offices are also trying to determine what the needs are in the disaster
zones, and our medical teams are ready to help if necessary," he added.</P>
      <P>So far, no Taiwanese citizens have been reported injured or killed in the two
quakes, according to Chang.</P>
      <P>A magnitude 8.0 quake struck Samoa Tuesday morning local time, triggering
tsunamis that engulfed American Samoa, Samoa and Tonga, killing at least 113
people in Samoa and 31 in U.S. Samoa and leaving many others missing.</P>
      <P>On the Indonesian island of Sumatra, a 7.6-magnitude earthquake stuck the north-
west city of Padang Wednesday and a second one of magnitude 6.8 rattled the
island Thursday.</P>
      <P>The first quake killed hundreds  of people and Indonesian officials said they
fear the death toll could soar to thousands.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the MOFA said that it has contacted the Philippines and Vietnam
governments to express concern over the losses caused by Typhoon Ketsana, which
hit the Philippines last weekend killing more than 240 people there before
moving on to Vietnam where 23 people have died in the storm.</P>

      <P>A proposed free-trade agreement Taiwan's government hopes the island will sign
with China will be sent to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation before being
implemented, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said
Thursday, in an attempt to appease widespread concerns that the administration
will reach agreement with Beijing without first seeking legislative or public
approval.</P>
      <P>Lai said at a legislative session that the government will soon complete
negotiations with China on the signing of the pact, known as the economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) . The government has said it hopes to
sign the agreement by next year.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, the administration will be supervised by the Legislative Yuan
through communications and consultations on issues pertaining to the agreement.</P>
      <P>Aside from giving reports to and listening to suggestions from the legislature
before engaging in negotiations with China, Lai said the MAC and government
agencies will keep it informed of the progress of negotiations.</P>
      <P>"The ECFA will become effective and be implemented  after negotiations with
China have been completed and the pact is approved by the legislature," Lai told
legislators.</P>
      <P>Lai added that her agency, which is in charge of developing Taiwan's policies
regarding mainland China, will continue to push for cross-strait negotiations
and economic and trade cooperation with China, as the stable and peaceful
development of relations between the two sides is not only important to Taiwan's
national existence, but also to peace and security in the Asia Pacific region.</P>
      <P>She said the government will further ease bans on Chinese investments in
Taiwan's securities market and other cross-strait banking and financial
exchanges.</P>
      <P>According to the MAC chairwoman, as of mid-September, a total of 3,081 outlets
operated by 44 banks in Taiwan have been approved to offer Chinese currency
exchange services, and up to 150 outlets have been allowed to accept Chinese
bank notes since Taiwan lifted restrictions on transactions of Chinese currency
in June 2008.</P>
      <P>In face of a rising China, Lai said, Taiwan should seek to improve cross-strait
ties. She added that her office will work to deepen cultural and educational
exchanges and strengthen information sharing across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lai said that over the past year, improved relations with China has indeed
brought substantial benefits for Taiwan and has helped improve Taiwan's
relations with the international community.</P>
      <P>Relations between the two sides have dramatically improved in the past year.
Regular direct flights and shipping links have been launched, both have regular
high level meetings, Taiwan has decided to allow Chinese investment in about 100
sectors and many more Chinese tourists are traveling to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lai added that the MAC will continue to work to promote cross-strait exchanges
and dialogue based on the rational principle of "facing reality, creating a
better future, shelving disputes, seeking a win-win situation" and the
principles of "equity, dignity, reciprocity" in order to realize the eventual
goal of permanent peace in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The two sides have yet to sign a peace treaty since the end of a civil war in
1949, the 60th anniversary of which is this month.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that it is scheduled to

      <P>"The process of closing down our representative office in Johannesburg is still

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan needs to participate in UNFCCC, ICAO: Premier Wu</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih on Thursday requested his Cabinet to work out substantive
steps Thursday to promote Taiwan's participation in the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO) to further expand the country's international involvement.</P>
      <P>Following Taiwan's success in its bid to attend the World Health Assembly -- the
World Health Organization's decision-making body -- as an observer for the first
time in May this year, the government has recently announced that the UNFCCC and
ICAO will be the country's next targets for "meaningful participation" in U.N.
specialized agencies.</P>
      <P>Raising the issue during a weekly Cabinet meeting, Wu noted it is in line with a
"pragmatic and flexible" diplomatic approach that instead of pushing for a bid
for U.N. membership, the government is now trying to promote broader
participation for Taiwan in affiliated organizations of the world body.</P>
      <P>In previous years, under the administration of former President Chen Shui-bian,
Taiwan had sought to join the U.N. each year. But such attempts had always
failed due to opposition from China, a U.N. Security Council permanent member.
Beginning last year, after President Ma Ying-jeou was elected, Taiwan no longer
made such attempts.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, Wu asserted Thursday that Taiwan needed to be involved in U.N.
affiliated agencies.</P>
      <P>Wu said the serious disaster caused by Typhoon Morakot in August has highlighted
the need for the government to pay closer attention to the possible impact of
global warming on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under this circumstances, it is necessary for Taiwan to seek to take part in the
UNFCCC and the World Meteorological Organization to strengthen Taiwan's access
to advanced climate technologies and data, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The premier instructed relevant agencies to make proper preparations prior to
the United Nations Climate Change Conference slated for Dec. 7-18 in Copenhagen.</P>
      <P>On the significance of Taiwan's bid to take part in the civil aviation group
ICAO, Wu said the Taipei flight information region occupies a pivotal position
in East Asian air traffic and that it is important for Taiwan to obtain
immediate flight information to ensure flight safety.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, officials at the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) in New
York said the office has requested the country's diplomatic allies to help send
a joint letter to the U.N. missions of UNFCCC signatories and ICAO members to
push the U.N. members to agree to grant Taiwan's request to join the two
organizations.</P>
      <P>The allies are expected to complete signing the letter within a week, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>Kao Jen-chuan, director of TECO-New York, who concurrently serves as chief of a
U.N. affairs task force, may also write to the U.N. missions of the diplomatic
allies to explain the purpose of Taiwan's bids.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Lawmakers voice opposition to health insurance premium hike</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.1  (CNA)
10/01/09  18:26:38
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators from across the political spectrum unanimously voiced opposition
Thursday to a government plan to raise the national health insurance premium
rate from next year, saying the time is not right for such a move.</P>
      <P>Their comments came a day after Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-
liang said his agency has almost completed a plan to raise health insurance
premiums to help prop up the nation's financially shaky health insurance
program.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, Yaung said, the insurance premium rate will be increased from
the current 4.55 percent to 5 percent of the monthly insured amount.</P>
      <P>"The planned adjustment should be affordable to most people. The average
citizens will need to pay only an additional NT$60 (US$1.86) to NT$70 per month
-- which is equivalent to the cost of a lunch box, " Yaung explained. "For the
wealthy, the increase will be equivalent to the price of five or six lunch
boxes."</P>
      <P>People in low-income groups may not be required to pay higher premiums or may
even see a drop in their rates, he said. For those in the lower income bracket
who will be required to pay more, the increase will only be equivalent to the
price of a small pack of instant noodles, he added.</P>
      <P>"In any case, the premium adjustment plan will not increase the financial burden
on economically disadvantaged groups, " Yaung stressed.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that some lawmakers had lobbied him to give the assurance that the
health insurance premiums would not be increased during his tenure, Yaung said
he could not make such a promise because he has to fulfill his duty to keep the
health insurance program afloat and sustainable.</P>
      <P>The program's deficit will hit NT$50 billion by the end of this year, Yaung
noted, adding that the planned premium hike would only help to prevent growth of
that figure.</P>
      <P>Yaung said his agency will do its utmost to persuade lawmakers to support the
premium hike plan.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Yaung's remarks, ruling Kuomintang legislative whip Lu Hsueh-chang
said his caucus' stance on the issue is crystal clear -- now is not the time to
raise health insurance premiums.</P>
      <P>Lu cited Premier Wu Den-yih's recent statement to back the KMT legislative
caucus' stance. "The premier has said premium hikes should be a last resort and
should only be considered after all other options have been exhausted," Lu said.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party legislative whip Wang Sing-nan echoed
Lu's view, saying that the party would not like to see an upward adjustment of
insurance premiums at this time as the domestic economy has yet to bottom out in
the country's worst-ever recession.</P>
      <P>Wang further said the proposed premium hike should not be introduced until the
Taipei City government repays its debts to the DOH's Bureau of National Health
Insurance (BNHI).</P>
      <P>As of the end of last year, the municipal governments of Taipei and Kaohsiung --
the country's two largest cities -- had defaulted on NT$25 billion in health
insurance subsidies that they should have paid for people who work in the two
cites but have their household registrations outside the cities.</P>
      <P>Many opposition lawmakers have been pushing the DOH to recover the debts owed by
the municipal governments before considering any increase in health insurance
premiums.</P>
      <P>But DOH officials have been leaning toward a plan for the Legislative Yuan to
revise the central and local governments tax revenue allocation law to resolve
the insurance premium subsidy issues once and for all.</P>

      <P>The first five years of the new municipality that will incorporate Taichung City
and Taichung County might be characterized  by chaos,  but its situation will
then improve substantially and swiftly, Taichung Mayor Jason Hu forecast
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Addressing a forum on the new Taichung municipality's development prospects, Hu
said residents of the central Taiwan area have high expectations of the merger
and upgrading of their region.</P>
      <P>"But the merging of the two administrative districts involves many complex tasks
that will be more difficult to address than many could imagine, " Hu said,
adding that transport infrastructure construction and urban design will be most
important tasks after the integration of the two administrative areas.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has approved a proposal that Taichung City and Taichung
County should be merged into a single special municipality, to be called
Taichung City, in late 2010.</P>
      <P>Noting that broad vision is needed  in planning  the new municipality
infrastructure, Hu said it will also take time for the city to change and
evolve.</P>
      <P>Pointing to a mass rapid transit (MRT) system project for the city, construction
of which is scheduled to officially begin later this month, Hu said the project
should be carried out in several phases and should be given financial support
from the central government.</P>
      <P>"At present, the city government can only plan the first and second phases of
the MRT construction. In the long run, the line should be extended to cover
Taichung Harbor and Taichung Airport to increase its viability, " Hu said,
adding that such expansion will become easier after the merger into a single
administrative body.</P>
      <P>"One plus one could equal more than two, " Hu said, referring to the development
potential and capacity of the merger of Taichung city and county.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's No. 2 brokerage - Fubon Securities - has reached an agreement with
specific partners and will soon set up a joint-venture company in mainland China
once Taiwan and China sign a financial memorandum of understanding (MOU), the
chairman of the company said Thursday.</P>
      <P>However, after signing the MOU on cross-Taiwan Strait cooperation on financial
supervision, Taiwanese-owned brokerage firms still will not be permitted to
operate A-shares businesses. In China, yuan-denominated A shares are for
domestic Chinese investors only, while foreign investors are allowed to invest
in B shares.</P>
      <P>But David Chang, chairman of Fubon Securities, said he hopes that Fubon will be
allowed to underwrite A shares and establish a wholly-owned China subsidiary in
the special economic zone that China has set up on its eastern coast, by the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The development of the economic zone got a nod from China's government in May.
The zone covers a large area spanning from the Pearl River Delta in southern
China to the Yangtze River Delta in northeast China, two of mainland China's
economic powerhouse regions. Southeastern China's Fujian province will serve as
the hub.</P>
      <P>"As long as we acquire one percent market share in China's A shares brokerage
market, we can duplicate another Fubon Securities which occupies 6.25 percent
market share in Taiwan, " Chang said, pointing out the importance of getting
access to underwrite A shares for Taiwanese brokerages in China.</P>
      <P>Chang added that the overall brokerage fee income of A shares in China reached
90 billion yuan in 2008, and is expected to top 100 billion yuan with 30 percent
growth every year.</P>
      <P>"The brokerage business is expected to be the first to score profits among
banking, insurance and brokerage businesses, " he said, explaining that most
Chinese brokerages lack experience on financial derivatives and innovation, so
Taiwanese brokerages can better use their strengths on electronic trading, risk
management and product innovation.</P>
      <P>According to mainland China's laws, foreign brokerage firms need to form joint
ventures with Chinese partners to get market access, with a minimum capital
requirement of 1.2 billion yuan and foreign ownership less than 33 percent. The
JVs also need to operate B share business for at least five years before
underwriting A shares.</P>

      <P>Farmers in northern Taiwan's Taoyuan County have created a piece of
"agricultural artwork" by planting different color crops in a rice paddy -
potentially opening a new trend of using crop planting to advertise, officials
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The artwork in Taoyuan shows the Chinese words "Taoyuan, Take Off" in swaths of
farmland along a section of the Sun Yat-sen Freeway.</P>
      <P>Featuring the words and the colored images of airplanes and high-rise buildings,
the work was created by members of the Taoyuan City Farmers' Association by
planting purple and green-leafed rice on two hectares of farmland.</P>
      <P>The creation has become a new landmark in Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>Officials of the COA's Agriculture and Food Agency said Thursday that the work
is part of a project launched by the agency in 2002 to encourage farmers to
gradually reduce the amount of land under cultivation by converting unprofitable
farmland to other uses.</P>
      <P>Since then,  the Miaoli District Agricultural Research and Extension Station,
has begun providing technology transfers of colored crop art work creations to
farmers, with the aim of boosting the value of farmland, according to the
officials.</P>
      <P>Farmland  can not only be used for rice cultivation  and landscaping, it can
also be used as an environmentally friendly tool for advertising, according to
Chang Su-chen, a researcher at the station.</P>
      <P>This is the first time that a rice-paddy art work has been created in so vast

year, with the aim of enhancing technical exchanges and economic cooperation
with the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the head of the
Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>BOFT Director-General Huang Chih-peng made the remarks at a news conference to

Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand.</P>
      <P>He noted that the development of the photovoltaic industry in Southeast Asia is
comparatively lagging behind that of Taiwan's and said the choice of the
photovoltaic industry as the theme of the summit will help local companies to
build partnerships with the photovoltaic industry in Southeast Asia and make
inroads into those markets.</P>
      <P>Lee Chun-li, an official of the Energy Bureau under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs,  also said Taiwan's photovoltaic industry benefits from its booming

      <P>The output of Taiwan's solar cells is presently number four in the world, with
the goal of reaching the number three position next year.</P>
      <P>Lee said Taiwan's promotion of the photovoltaic industry should target overseas
markets,  noting that Southeast  Asia is also developing the industry, which
will provide Taiwan manufacturers with good opportunities.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China showcased its military hardware in a parade in Beijing Thursday to
celebrate its 60th national day, but a U.S. expert said sustained efforts are
needed to detect and understand China's military approach.</P>
      <P>The wide range of home-developed weaponry on display in the largest-ever parade
included nuclear-capable missiles, fighter jets, aerial drones and other
advanced arms.</P>
      <P>Dean Chang, a research fellow with the U.S.-based Heritage Foundation, said in
an article delivered to the CNA that in some respects, the big guns displayed
were a distraction.</P>
      <P>Lower-profile command, control and communications systems, such as airborne
early-warning  and control aircraft and satellite- communications devices, more
accurately reflect the comprehensive challenge of China's expanding military
capabilities, he said.</P>
      <P>These systems might not look particularly special in a parade, but they evince
the increasing sophistication of China's strategic thinking and technology, he
added.</P>
      <P>China is not aiming to match the U.S. weapon-for-weapon. Instead, China is
pursuing an "asymmetric" approach. It is a view of future warfare, expounded in
PLA analyses, that focuses more on enabling the PLA to gather, transmit and
exploit information while denying an opponent that same ability, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Less noticeable, but arguably even more important and worrisome, Chang
continued, is a coherent doctrine and improved training regimens. PLA training
efforts include extensive exercising of command-and-control  capabilities,
employing  forces that cross military region boundaries, and "conducting
training in complex electromagnetic environments," a reference to both
electronic warfare and cyberwarfare.</P>
      <P>He said the U.S. needs long-term, in-depth analyses of Chinese capabilities that
go beyond the "bean counting" of new systems to look at logistical capabilities
and training regimens.</P>
      <P>This will require extensive examination of Chinese-language materials such as
PLA reference volumes, textbooks and other official publications, because much
of this will involve reshaped doctrine and adjusted metrics rather than physical
systems, and this entails expanding the ranks of analysts familiar with Chinese
military publications and capable of assessing their authoritativeness.</P>
      <P>Addressing  changes to Chinese strategy  will also require maintaining a
substantial U.S. force in the East Asian region, and conventional capabilities
in the area -- long the American strong suit -- must be maintained, both to
reassure American allies and to signal to China that the U.S. has continued
commitment to the region, he added.</P>
      <P>The most difficult challenge for U.S. policy makers, however, will be
interacting with members of the PLA itself. There is arguably no better means of
learning about changes within a military than by talking with its members,
observing its exercises, and even going to its academies and institutions of
higher military education.</P>
      <P>He said the U.S. is clearly the dominant military power in the Asia-Pacific
region today, but China is gaining fast, and China's expanding range of national
interests and military capabilities suggest there will be greater likelihood of
brushing up against the U.S., both inside and outside Asia.</P>
      <P>Chang said it is important that the two sides reduce the opportunity for
misunderstanding or miscalculation -- be it of capability or intention. This is
impossible unless U.S. analysts can get focus on China's growing operational
capabilities, he concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan dance company to perform at arts festival in Rhode Island</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's first all-male dance company "Horse" will stage its highly acclaimed
production "Velocity" at the FirstWorks Festival in Providence, Rhode Island on
Oct. 24, company manager Fred Chuang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>While visiting Taiwan early this year, the festival's artistic director Kathleen
Pletcher invited "Horse" to present "Velocity" at the Providence festival, an
annual cultural event which was first launched in 2004, Chuang said.</P>
      <P>In the production "Velocity", the dance group explores how the frenetic nature
of contemporary society pulls people and things apart. The production
synthesizes elements of experimental theater, drama and mime.</P>
      <P>The choreography reflects the observations of the young "Horse" members on
evolution, progress and loss in the speed of movements, according to Chuang.</P>
      <P>In April 2008, the overseas premiere of "Velocity" in New York's Joyce Theater
won the young company a review in the New York Times.</P>
      <P>On April 18, 2008, Art critic Jennifer Dunning said in the New York Times: "The
evening-length work that Horse presented in this American debut, looked
essentially like a series of favorite bits, set to well-chosen music by
composers ranging from Mozart and Bach to John Cage and Michael Gordon. The
piece ran out of steam toward the end, but until then it was a feast of
evocative, playful small dances showcasing the supple physicality and subtle
dramatic gifts of its performers."</P>
      <P>The visit to Providence will be "Horse" dance company's third visit to the U.S.
since it was founded in 2007. After its well acclaimed performance in April 2007
at the Mandance Project at Joyce Theater, the five-man troupe was again invited
to present their new production "Bones" at the 2009 Mandance Project at the
Joyce Theater in April.</P>
      <P>FirstWorks is a multidimensional arts organization recognized with eight
national endowment of the arts grants in the U.S. Since 2004, the organization
has collaborated with the City of Providence's Department of Art, Culture and
Tourism to present an annual art festival. The 2009 festival, Sept. 24VNov. 15,
features dance, music, theater and interactive installations.</P>
      <P>Upon returning from the U.S., the group will be preparing for the premiere of a
new production "Growing Up", according to Chuang.</P>
      <P>Four performances of "Growing Up" are scheduled from Dec. 4-6 at the Taipei
National University of the Arts.</P>
      <P>"Velocity" is a joint production of choreographers/dancers Chen Wu-kang, Wu Wei-
chia, Yang Yu-min, Huang Yi, Chang Tzu-ling and Kao Yung-yu.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Health minister does U-turn on insurance rate hike</HEADLINE>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In an about-face, Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang said
Thursday that the national health insurance premium rate will not be hiked for
the moment, although the insured amount of rich people will be raised.</P>
      <P>The "no hike" statement came just a day after Yaung said the DOH had almost
completed a plan to increase the insurance premium rate from the current 4.55
percent to 5 percent of the monthly insured amount from next year to help prop
up the country's cash-strapped health insurance program.</P>
      <P>The proposed premium adjustment plan immediately drew fire from legislators from
across the political spectrum who said the time was not right for such a move.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers from both the ruling and opposition camps also cited a recent
statement by Premier Wu Den-yih to back their stance. Wu said the previous week
that health insurance premium hikes should be a last resort and should only be
considered after all other options have been exhausted.</P>
      <P>In an apparent response to the lawmakers' opposition, Yaung said the rate hike
plan will be shelved for the time being.</P>
      <P>But he added that the insured amount of the wealthy will be raised so that they
have to pay more for the health insurance program.</P>
      <P>"The gap between the insured monthly salary amounts of the lowest- and highest-
income groups of people will be widened from the current 7.6 times to between 10
and 15 times," Yaung said.</P>
      <P>According to Yaung, the health insurance program's deficit will hit NT$50
billion by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Many opposition lawmakers have been pushing the DOH to recover the debts owed by
the Taipei city government before considering any increase in health insurance
premiums.</P>
      <P>The Taipei city government has so far defaulted on NT$30 billion in health
insurance subsidies that they should have paid for people who work in the city
but have their household registrations outside the city.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said Thursday the city government plan to repay all of
its debts to the DOH's Bureau of National Health Insurance in five years.</P>

      <P>In line with a government policy to make Taiwan a low-carbon society, plans are
being drawn up to transform 55 of the country's  old industrial  compounds  into
eco-friendly facilities, with three of them selected to serve as "flagship
depots" in the initial stage, officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to officials of the Industrial Development Bureau under the Ministry
of Economic Affairs (MOEA) , the bureau is considering installing solar panels
and some 1,800 LED lamps in these aging industrial compounds -- which cover a
combined total of more than 10,000 square meters -- as part of its efforts to
realize the renovation plan.</P>
      <P>"All the solar panels and LED equipment will be products manufactured by
Taiwanese companies," the official noted.</P>
      <P>Juifang Industrial  District  in northern  Taiwan,  Chushan Industrial  District
in central Taiwan and Kuantien Industrial District in the south are being
targeted as the "flagship" versions of the planned eco-friendly facilities that
will focus on ecology, culture and health-related concepts, the officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Rainfall, mudslides to be major factors in typhoon disaster control</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu said Thursday that rainfall and mudslides will be
major considerations factored in along with wind strength in typhoon-induced
disaster prevention and control measures.</P>
      <P>Chu made the remarks when presiding over a meeting to step up preparations
against two typhoons that forecasters said could affect Taiwan over the weekend.</P>
      <P>In the past, the government has used wind strength to gauge the strength of
typhoons when preparing for major disasters and has used it as basis for whether
to announce class or office closures, Chu said.</P>
      <P>"But we have learned a lesson from past experience and most recently from
Typhoon Morakot, " he went on, adding that "wind strength is not the only
factor, as damage from rainfall and mudslides can be much more serious."</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot swept across the country in early August, triggering the worst
flooding and mudslides in half a century. Nearly 700 people died, including
around 400 victims from Siaolin village in Kaohsiung County who were buried
alive when their village was inundated by mud.</P>
      <P>Chu said that in future, the Central Emergency Operation Center (CEOC) , the
National Police Administration and National Fire Agency will work closely with
their local counterparts, while the military will also be prepared to provide
emergency rescue services, support and resettlement.</P>
      <P>The government will also join forces with civic organizations such as the Red
Cross Society of the Republic of China, the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi
Foundation and volunteer groups to carry out disaster relief work.</P>
      <P>Those areas that are prone to flooding will be divided into two categories --
more serious and less serious areas. But whether the residents in these two
categories will be evacuated during flooding will be decided by the CEOC.</P>
      <P>The CEOC will study the information  provided  by related government agencies
such as the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) , the Department of Agriculture and the
Water Resources Agency when making such decisions.</P>
      <P>Earlier, Premier Wu Den-yih said that flood prevention and dredging will be
given priority.</P>
      <P>He also said the Cabinet will propose a white paper on disaster prevention
every  year  to underscore  the  Executive  Yuan's determination to shoulder its
responsibilities in this regard.</P>
      <P>In this way, the public can learn about the land conservation and
rehabilitation, as well as disaster-fighting mechanisms.</P>
      <P>The white paper will also list the annual budget for disaster prevention and
control in a transparent way, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, The CWB said the strength of the two typhoons -- Parma and Melor --
which were southeast of Taiwan -- had increased and that both were moving in a
west-northwesterly trajectory.</P>
      <P>CWB Director Shin Tsai-chin predicted that the two storms would be east of the
Philippines and southeast of Taiwan by Sunday.</P>
      <P>He warned the public to be on guard, noting that the outer edges of the typhoons
could join forces with the northeasterly monsoon to produce torrential rain in
northern and eastern parts of the country.</P>

      <P>Former Health Minister Chen Chien-jen was awarded a top-level French order
Thursday in Taipei in recognition of his excellence in research in the field of
genomics and molecular epidemiology  and his contributions  to promoting France-
Taiwan scientific cooperation.</P>
      <P>Patrick Bonneville, France's top representative to Taiwan, hosted a ceremony at
his residence to award Chen the Officer of the Order of the Academic Palms,
describing him as an outstanding scientist who has played a significant role in
bilateral research cooperation between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The function was attended by Wong Chi-huey, president of Academia Sinica, as
well as other experts from the local academic and medical sectors.</P>
      <P>Chen said he was honored to receive the medal on behalf of all the scientists
who have contributed over the years to the many bilateral research projects
between Taiwan and France.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, bilateral cooperation between Taiwan and France lies not only
in the field of science and high technology, but also in helping broaden the
international perspective of young scientists from both countries.</P>
      <P>"Science and technology have no borders and the passion demonstrated by both
Taiwanese and French scientists in their research goes beyond the language
barrier," said Chen.</P>
      <P>"I hope that in the future, our work in medical, communication and
nanotechnology will benefit not only people in Taiwan and France, but also the
rest of the world," he added.</P>
      <P>Thanks to Chen's dynamism and personal involvement, France is now ranked as the
second scientific partner of Taiwan in terms of the number of joint research
projects, following the United States, according to the French Institute.</P>
      <P>Chen, who visited France many times during his term as National Science Council
(NSC) minister, helped launch several important cooperation schemes between
Taiwan and France, including the "Orchid partnership, " which supports new joint
research projects, and the "Frontiers of Science" symposia, which promotes
exchanges among young French and Taiwanese scientists, according to the
institute.</P>
      <P>Chen also helped establish a multi-thematic cooperative program between the NSC
and the French National Agency for Research in January 2007 --  a program that
was at that time the first institutional partnership of the French agency with a
foreign agency outside Europe, it added.</P>

      <P>With the high maintenance fees for the World Games Main Stadium in Kaohsiung
City, several legislators questioned Thursday whether the Sports Affairs Council
(SAC) , which has taken over management of the stadium, can afford to operate
it.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Chiang Nai-hsin said during a legislative
session that the SAC has set up a management division in charge of the stadium's
operations and that personnel expenses and maintenance fees are estimated to
reach up to NT$250 million, while the SAC has been granted a budget of just
NT$70 million.</P>
      <P>The legislative session was held to discuss issues related to the Kaohsiung
World Games in July and the Taipei Deaflympics  in September, as well as
baseball revitalization plans.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Cheng Chin-ling suggested that the SAC, the highest authority in
Taiwan for physical fitness and sports, should hand the operating rights of the
stadium over to the Kaohsiung city government.</P>
      <P>In response, SAC Minister Tai Hsia-ling said the council will spare no efforts
to host large-scale international events to make good use of the equipment and
facilities and the experience of hosting the World Games. At present, the SAC is
seeking to host the 2017 East Asian Games.</P>
      <P>Tai added that the SAC is also planning to arrange for national sports events
and training sessions, as well as other community and cultural activities, to be
held at the stadium. A portion of the space will also be used for commercial
purposes.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Thursday that while seeking to improve cross-Taiwan
Strait relations, the government will try to ensure it maintains strong enough
forces to defend the sovereignty and safety of the nation.</P>
      <P>The premier was responding to remarks by People's Republic of China (PRC)
President Hu Jintao earlier in the day in Beijing.</P>
      <P>In a speech delivered after reviewing troops in a parade in celebration of the
PRC's 60th national day, Hu pledged to "push forward the peaceful development of
relations across the Taiwan Strait" amid a historic thaw between the two sides.</P>
      <P>"We will continue to strive for the complete reunification of our motherland,
which is the common aspiration of the Chinese nation," Hu added.</P>
      <P>At a tea party for the press, Wu urged China to face the reality that the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait have been under different jurisdictions  since 1949.
"Only by doing so can a peaceful development of cross-strait relations be
assured," he said.</P>
      <P>Citing a proverb that says that "any nation that does not face difficulties or
enemies is doomed to fail, " Wu said Taiwan must "prepare for the worst (in
dealing with China) " at the same time that it tries to increase contacts.</P>
      <P>Since cross-strait tension has been greatly relieved, Wu said, both Taiwan and
China should shelve those disputes that cannot be solved in a short period of
time so as to create a "win-win" situation between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Saying that Taiwan respects "whatever forms of celebrations China chooses to
mark its 60th national day, " Wu added that while pursing closer ties with
China, Taiwan will also try to enhance bilateral relations with the United

      <P>The military will deploy troops in potential danger zones on a standby basis
upon the issuance of a typhoon warning, the Ministry of National Defense (MND)
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Vice Defense Minister Huang Yi-ping said the number of deployed forces will
exceed 6,000 personnel.</P>
      <P>In Hualien and Taitung counties, the military will deploy about 400 servicemen,
as well as generators and water pumps, while in northern Taiwan, around 3,000
servicemen equipped with amphibious vehicles and rubber boats will be placed on
standby, he said.</P>
      <P>In southern Taiwan, around 2,000 soldiers will be deployed, along with pumps and
diggers, while in central Taiwan, 1,700 will be deployed with various heavy
equipment.</P>
      <P>Similar measures will be taken on the outlying islands of Penghu, Matsu and
Kinmen, he added.</P>
      <P>"The remaining troops will be divided into a first contingency group, which will
be ready to depart for affected areas 10 minutes after a disaster is reported,
while a second contingency group will depart for the areas three hours later,"
he added.</P>
      <P>The military has also investigated the status of idle and still usable military
barracks in various cities and counties, and has planned 34 shelters in 22
cities and counties able to accommodate around 14,000 disaster victims.</P>
      <P>Huang said the military "has reviewed its rescue operations during Typhoon
Morakot in early August and has made major changes in its disaster prevention

      <P>He added that in future, the ranks of military personnel stationed at the
Central Emergency Operation Center will be upgraded and that additional staff
will be stationed there to be in charge of coordination with government
agencies, equipment, personnel dispatch and news dissemination.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Central Weather Bureau said that whether two approaching typhoons
-- Parma and Melor -- will make a direct hit on Taiwan was not yet certain, but
it predicted heavy rain for northern and eastern parts of Taiwan due to the
combined effect of the two typhoons and the northeasterly monsoon.</P>

      <P>The Taipei Summit 2009 has chosen the photovoltaic industry as its theme this
year, with the aim of enhancing technical exchanges and economic cooperation
with the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the head of the
Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>BOFT Director-General Huang Chih-peng made the remarks at a news conference to
promote the upcoming conference, which will be jointly sponsored by Taipei
Summit 2009 and Photovoltaic Taiwan Forum 2009, and will take place Oct. 7,
bringing together more than 80 officials and business representatives from the
Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand.</P>
      <P>He noted that the development of the photovoltaic industry in Southeast Asia is
comparatively lagging behind that of Taiwan's and said the choice of the
photovoltaic industry as the theme of the summit will help local companies to
build partnerships with the photovoltaic industry in Southeast Asia and make
inroads into those markets.</P>
      <P>Lee Chun-li, an official of the Energy Bureau under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs,  also said Taiwan's photovoltaic industry benefits from its booming
semiconductor industry.</P>
      <P>The output of Taiwan's solar cells is presently number four in the world, with
the goal of reaching the number three position next year.</P>
      <P>Lee said Taiwan's promotion of the photovoltaic industry should target overseas
markets,  noting that Southeast  Asia is also developing the industry, which
will provide Taiwan manufacturers with good opportunities.</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese manufacturers could tap the Southeast Asian market by forming
technology cooperation or transfer agreements with their counterparts there," he

      <P>China showcased its military hardware in a parade in Beijing Thursday to
celebrate its 60th national day, but a U.S. expert said sustained efforts are
needed to detect and understand China's military approach.</P>
      <P>The wide range of home-developed weaponry on display in the largest-ever parade
included nuclear-capable missiles, fighter jets, aerial drones and other
advanced arms.</P>
      <P>Dean Chang, a research fellow with the U.S.-based Heritage Foundation, said in
an article delivered to the CNA that in some respects, the big guns displayed
were a distraction.</P>
      <P>Lower-profile command, control and communications systems, such as airborne
early-warning  and control aircraft and satellite- communications devices, more
accurately reflect the comprehensive challenge of China's expanding military
capabilities, he said.</P>
      <P>These systems might not look particularly special in a parade, but they evince
the increasing sophistication of China's strategic thinking and technology, he
added.</P>
      <P>China is not aiming to match the U.S. weapon-for-weapon. Instead, China is
pursuing an "asymmetric" approach. It is a view of future warfare, expounded in
PLA analyses, that focuses more on enabling the PLA to gather, transmit and
exploit information while denying an opponent that same ability, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Less noticeable, but arguably even more important and worrisome, Chang
continued, is a coherent doctrine and improved training regimens. PLA training
efforts include extensive exercising of command-and-control  capabilities,
employing  forces that cross military region boundaries, and "conducting
training in complex electromagnetic environments," a reference to both
electronic warfare and cyberwarfare.</P>
      <P>He said the U.S. needs long-term, in-depth analyses of Chinese capabilities that
go beyond the "bean counting" of new systems to look at logistical capabilities
and training regimens.</P>
      <P>This will require extensive examination of Chinese-language materials such as
PLA reference volumes, textbooks and other official publications, because much
of this will involve reshaped doctrine and adjusted metrics rather than physical
systems, and this entails expanding the ranks of analysts familiar with Chinese
military publications and capable of assessing their authoritativeness.</P>
      <P>Addressing  changes to Chinese strategy  will also require maintaining a
substantial U.S. force in the East Asian region, and conventional capabilities
in the area -- long the American strong suit -- must be maintained, both to
reassure American allies and to signal to China that the U.S. has continued
commitment to the region, he added.</P>
      <P>The most difficult challenge for U.S. policy makers, however, will be
interacting with members of the PLA itself. There is arguably no better means of
learning about changes within a military than by talking with its members,
observing its exercises, and even going to its academies and institutions of
higher military education.</P>
      <P>He said the U.S. is clearly the dominant military power in the Asia-Pacific
region today, but China is gaining fast, and China's expanding range of national
interests and military capabilities suggest there will be greater likelihood of
brushing up against the U.S., both inside and outside Asia.</P>
      <P>Chang said it is important that the two sides reduce the opportunity for
misunderstanding or miscalculation -- be it of capability or intention. This is
impossible unless U.S. analysts can get focus on China's growing operational
capabilities, he concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan dance company to perform at arts festival in Rhode Island</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's first all-male dance company "Horse" will stage its highly acclaimed
production "Velocity" at the FirstWorks Festival in Providence, Rhode Island on
Oct. 24, company manager Fred Chuang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>While visiting Taiwan early this year, the festival's artistic director Kathleen
Pletcher invited "Horse" to present "Velocity" at the Providence festival, an
annual cultural event which was first launched in 2004, Chuang said.</P>
      <P>In the production "Velocity", the dance group explores how the frenetic nature
of contemporary society pulls people and things apart. The production
synthesizes elements of experimental theater, drama and mime.</P>
      <P>The choreography reflects the observations of the young "Horse" members on
evolution, progress and loss in the speed of movements, according to Chuang.</P>
      <P>In April 2008, the overseas premiere of "Velocity" in New York's Joyce Theater
won the young company a review in the New York Times.</P>
      <P>On April 18, 2008, Art critic Jennifer Dunning said in the New York Times: "The
evening-length work that Horse presented in this American debut, looked
essentially like a series of favorite bits, set to well-chosen music by
composers ranging from Mozart and Bach to John Cage and Michael Gordon. The
piece ran out of steam toward the end, but until then it was a feast of
evocative, playful small dances showcasing the supple physicality and subtle
dramatic gifts of its performers."</P>
      <P>The visit to Providence will be "Horse" dance company's third visit to the U.S.
since it was founded in 2007. After its well acclaimed performance in April 2007
at the Mandance Project at Joyce Theater, the five-man troupe was again invited
to present their new production "Bones" at the 2009 Mandance Project at the
Joyce Theater in April.</P>
      <P>FirstWorks is a multidimensional arts organization recognized with eight
national endowment of the arts grants in the U.S. Since 2004, the organization
has collaborated with the City of Providence's Department of Art, Culture and
Tourism to present an annual art festival. The 2009 festival, Sept. 24VNov. 15,
features dance, music, theater and interactive installations.</P>
      <P>Upon returning from the U.S., the group will be preparing for the premiere of a
new production "Growing Up", according to Chuang.</P>
      <P>Four performances of "Growing Up" are scheduled from Dec. 4-6 at the Taipei
National University of the Arts.</P>
      <P>"Velocity" is a joint production of choreographers/dancers Chen Wu-kang, Wu Wei-
chia, Yang Yu-min, Huang Yi, Chang Tzu-ling and Kao Yung-yu.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Health minister does U-turn on insurance rate hike</HEADLINE>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In an about-face, Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang said
Thursday that the national health insurance premium rate will not be hiked for
the moment, although the insured amount of rich people will be raised.</P>
      <P>The "no hike" statement came just a day after Yaung said the DOH had almost
completed a plan to increase the insurance premium rate from the current 4.55
percent to 5 percent of the monthly insured amount from next year to help prop
up the country's cash-strapped health insurance program.</P>
      <P>The proposed premium adjustment plan immediately drew fire from legislators from
across the political spectrum who said the time was not right for such a move.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers from both the ruling and opposition camps also cited a recent
statement by Premier Wu Den-yih to back their stance. Wu said the previous week
that health insurance premium hikes should be a last resort and should only be
considered after all other options have been exhausted.</P>
      <P>In an apparent response to the lawmakers' opposition, Yaung said the rate hike
plan will be shelved for the time being.</P>
      <P>But he added that the insured amount of the wealthy will be raised so that they
have to pay more for the health insurance program.</P>
      <P>"The gap between the insured monthly salary amounts of the lowest- and highest-
income groups of people will be widened from the current 7.6 times to between 10
and 15 times," Yaung said.</P>
      <P>According to Yaung, the health insurance program's deficit will hit NT$50
billion by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Many opposition lawmakers have been pushing the DOH to recover the debts owed by
the Taipei city government before considering any increase in health insurance
premiums.</P>
      <P>The Taipei city government has so far defaulted on NT$30 billion in health
insurance subsidies that they should have paid for people who work in the city
but have their household registrations outside the city.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said Thursday the city government plan to repay all of
its debts to the DOH's Bureau of National Health Insurance in five years.</P>

      <P>In line with a government policy to make Taiwan a low-carbon society, plans are
being drawn up to transform 55 of the country's  old industrial  compounds  into
eco-friendly facilities, with three of them selected to serve as "flagship
depots" in the initial stage, officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to officials of the Industrial Development Bureau under the Ministry
of Economic Affairs (MOEA) , the bureau is considering installing solar panels
and some 1,800 LED lamps in these aging industrial compounds -- which cover a
combined total of more than 10,000 square meters -- as part of its efforts to
realize the renovation plan.</P>
      <P>"All the solar panels and LED equipment will be products manufactured by
Taiwanese companies," the official noted.</P>
      <P>Juifang Industrial  District  in northern  Taiwan,  Chushan Industrial  District
in central Taiwan and Kuantien Industrial District in the south are being
targeted as the "flagship" versions of the planned eco-friendly facilities that
will focus on ecology, culture and health-related concepts, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The upgrading plan is expected to create over 8,700 jobs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Rainfall, mudslides to be major factors in typhoon disaster control</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu said Thursday that rainfall and mudslides will be
major considerations factored in along with wind strength in typhoon-induced
disaster prevention and control measures.</P>
      <P>Chu made the remarks when presiding over a meeting to step up preparations
against two typhoons that forecasters said could affect Taiwan over the weekend.</P>
      <P>In the past, the government has used wind strength to gauge the strength of
typhoons when preparing for major disasters and has used it as basis for whether
to announce class or office closures, Chu said.</P>
      <P>"But we have learned a lesson from past experience and most recently from
Typhoon Morakot, " he went on, adding that "wind strength is not the only
factor, as damage from rainfall and mudslides can be much more serious."</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot swept across the country in early August, triggering the worst
flooding and mudslides in half a century. Nearly 700 people died, including
around 400 victims from Siaolin village in Kaohsiung County who were buried
alive when their village was inundated by mud.</P>
      <P>Chu said that in future, the Central Emergency Operation Center (CEOC) , the
National Police Administration and National Fire Agency will work closely with
their local counterparts, while the military will also be prepared to provide
emergency rescue services, support and resettlement.</P>
      <P>The government will also join forces with civic organizations such as the Red
Cross Society of the Republic of China, the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi
Foundation and volunteer groups to carry out disaster relief work.</P>
      <P>Those areas that are prone to flooding will be divided into two categories --
more serious and less serious areas. But whether the residents in these two
categories will be evacuated during flooding will be decided by the CEOC.</P>
      <P>The CEOC will study the information  provided  by related government agencies
such as the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) , the Department of Agriculture and the
Water Resources Agency when making such decisions.</P>
      <P>Earlier, Premier Wu Den-yih said that flood prevention and dredging will be
given priority.</P>
      <P>He also said the Cabinet will propose a white paper on disaster prevention
every  year  to underscore  the  Executive  Yuan's determination to shoulder its
responsibilities in this regard.</P>
      <P>In this way, the public can learn about the land conservation and
rehabilitation, as well as disaster-fighting mechanisms.</P>
      <P>The white paper will also list the annual budget for disaster prevention and
control in a transparent way, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, The CWB said the strength of the two typhoons -- Parma and Melor --
which were southeast of Taiwan -- had increased and that both were moving in a
west-northwesterly trajectory.</P>
      <P>CWB Director Shin Tsai-chin predicted that the two storms would be east of the
Philippines and southeast of Taiwan by Sunday.</P>
      <P>He warned the public to be on guard, noting that the outer edges of the typhoons
could join forces with the northeasterly monsoon to produce torrential rain in
northern and eastern parts of the country.</P>

      <P>Former Health Minister Chen Chien-jen was awarded a top-level French order
Thursday in Taipei in recognition of his excellence in research in the field of

Taiwan scientific cooperation.</P>
      <P>Patrick Bonneville, France's top representative to Taiwan, hosted a ceremony at

describing him as an outstanding scientist who has played a significant role in
bilateral research cooperation between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The function was attended by Wong Chi-huey, president of Academia Sinica, as

      <P>Chen said he was honored to receive the medal on behalf of all the scientists
who have contributed over the years to the many bilateral research projects
between Taiwan and France.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, bilateral cooperation between Taiwan and France lies not only
in the field of science and high technology, but also in helping broaden the
international perspective of young scientists from both countries.</P>
      <P>"Science and technology have no borders and the passion demonstrated by both
Taiwanese and French scientists in their research goes beyond the language
barrier," said Chen.</P>
      <P>"I hope that in the future, our work in medical, communication and
nanotechnology will benefit not only people in Taiwan and France, but also the
rest of the world," he added.</P>
      <P>Thanks to Chen's dynamism and personal involvement, France is now ranked as the
second scientific partner of Taiwan in terms of the number of joint research
projects, following the United States, according to the French Institute.</P>
      <P>Chen, who visited France many times during his term as National Science Council
(NSC) minister, helped launch several important cooperation schemes between
Taiwan and France, including the "Orchid partnership, " which supports new joint
research projects, and the "Frontiers of Science" symposia, which promotes
exchanges among young French and Taiwanese scientists, according to the

      <P>With the high maintenance fees for the World Games Main Stadium in Kaohsiung
City, several legislators questioned Thursday whether the Sports Affairs Council
(SAC) , which has taken over management of the stadium, can afford to operate
it.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Chiang Nai-hsin said during a legislative
session that the SAC has set up a management division in charge of the stadium's
operations and that personnel expenses and maintenance fees are estimated to
reach up to NT$250 million, while the SAC has been granted a budget of just
NT$70 million.</P>
      <P>The legislative session was held to discuss issues related to the Kaohsiung
World Games in July and the Taipei Deaflympics  in September, as well as
baseball revitalization plans.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Cheng Chin-ling suggested that the SAC, the highest authority in
Taiwan for physical fitness and sports, should hand the operating rights of the
stadium over to the Kaohsiung city government.</P>
      <P>In response, SAC Minister Tai Hsia-ling said the council will spare no efforts
to host large-scale international events to make good use of the equipment and
facilities and the experience of hosting the World Games. At present, the SAC is
seeking to host the 2017 East Asian Games.</P>
      <P>Tai added that the SAC is also planning to arrange for national sports events
and training sessions, as well as other community and cultural activities, to be

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Thursday that while seeking to improve cross-Taiwan
Strait relations, the government will try to ensure it maintains strong enough
forces to defend the sovereignty and safety of the nation.</P>
      <P>The premier was responding to remarks by People's Republic of China (PRC)
President Hu Jintao earlier in the day in Beijing.</P>
      <P>In a speech delivered after reviewing troops in a parade in celebration of the
PRC's 60th national day, Hu pledged to "push forward the peaceful development of
relations across the Taiwan Strait" amid a historic thaw between the two sides.</P>
      <P>"We will continue to strive for the complete reunification of our motherland,
which is the common aspiration of the Chinese nation," Hu added.</P>
      <P>At a tea party for the press, Wu urged China to face the reality that the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait have been under different jurisdictions  since 1949.
"Only by doing so can a peaceful development of cross-strait relations be
assured," he said.</P>
      <P>Citing a proverb that says that "any nation that does not face difficulties or
enemies is doomed to fail, " Wu said Taiwan must "prepare for the worst (in
dealing with China) " at the same time that it tries to increase contacts.</P>
      <P>Since cross-strait tension has been greatly relieved, Wu said, both Taiwan and
China should shelve those disputes that cannot be solved in a short period of
time so as to create a "win-win" situation between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Saying that Taiwan respects "whatever forms of celebrations China chooses to

China, Taiwan will also try to enhance bilateral relations with the United

      <P>The military will deploy troops in potential danger zones on a standby basis
upon the issuance of a typhoon warning, the Ministry of National Defense (MND)
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Vice Defense Minister Huang Yi-ping said the number of deployed forces will
exceed 6,000 personnel.</P>
      <P>In Hualien and Taitung counties, the military will deploy about 400 servicemen,
as well as generators and water pumps, while in northern Taiwan, around 3,000
servicemen equipped with amphibious vehicles and rubber boats will be placed on
standby, he said.</P>
      <P>In southern Taiwan, around 2,000 soldiers will be deployed, along with pumps and
diggers, while in central Taiwan, 1,700 will be deployed with various heavy
equipment.</P>
      <P>Similar measures will be taken on the outlying islands of Penghu, Matsu and
Kinmen, he added.</P>
      <P>"The remaining troops will be divided into a first contingency group, which will
be ready to depart for affected areas 10 minutes after a disaster is reported,
while a second contingency group will depart for the areas three hours later,"
he added.</P>
      <P>The military has also investigated the status of idle and still usable military
barracks in various cities and counties, and has planned 34 shelters in 22
cities and counties able to accommodate around 14,000 disaster victims.</P>
      <P>Huang said the military "has reviewed its rescue operations during Typhoon
Morakot in early August and has made major changes in its disaster prevention
and rescue methods."</P>
      <P>He added that in future, the ranks of military personnel stationed at the
Central Emergency Operation Center will be upgraded and that additional staff
will be stationed there to be in charge of coordination with government
agencies, equipment, personnel dispatch and news dissemination.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Central Weather Bureau said that whether two approaching typhoons
-- Parma and Melor -- will make a direct hit on Taiwan was not yet certain, but
it predicted heavy rain for northern and eastern parts of Taiwan due to the
combined effect of the two typhoons and the northeasterly monsoon.</P>

      <P>With the high maintenance fees for the World Games Main Stadium in Kaohsiung
City, several legislators questioned Thursday whether the Sports Affairs Council
(SAC) , which has taken over management of the stadium, can afford to operate
it.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Chiang Nai-hsin said during a legislative
session that the SAC has set up a management division in charge of the stadium's
operations and that personnel expenses and maintenance fees are estimated to
reach up to NT$250 million, while the SAC has been granted a budget of just
NT$70 million.</P>
      <P>The legislative session was held to discuss issues related to the Kaohsiung
World Games in July and the Taipei Deaflympics  in September, as well as
baseball revitalization plans.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Cheng Chin-ling suggested that the SAC, the highest authority in
Taiwan for physical fitness and sports, should hand the operating rights of the
stadium over to the Kaohsiung city government.</P>
      <P>In response, SAC Minister Tai Hsia-ling said the council will spare no efforts
to host large-scale international events to make good use of the equipment and
facilities and the experience of hosting the World Games. At present, the SAC is
seeking to host the 2017 East Asian Games.</P>
      <P>Tai added that the SAC is also planning to arrange for national sports events
and training sessions, as well as other community and cultural activities, to be
held at the stadium. A portion of the space will also be used for commercial
purposes.</P>
      <P>She also asked legislators to help out while reviewing budget bills for the
stadium's operations in the future.</P>

      <P>The military will deploy troops in potential danger zones on a standby basis
upon the issuance of a typhoon warning, the Ministry of National Defense (MND)
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Vice Defense Minister Huang Yi-ping said the number of deployed forces will
exceed 6,000 personnel.</P>
      <P>In Hualien and Taitung counties, the military will deploy about 400 servicemen,
as well as generators and water pumps, while in northern Taiwan, around 3,000
servicemen equipped with amphibious vehicles and rubber boats will be placed on
standby, he said.</P>
      <P>In southern Taiwan, around 2,000 soldiers will be deployed, along with pumps and
diggers, while in central Taiwan, 1,700 will be deployed with various heavy
equipment.</P>
      <P>Similar measures will be taken on the outlying islands of Penghu, Matsu and
Kinmen, he added.</P>
      <P>"The remaining troops will be divided into a first contingency group, which will
be ready to depart for affected areas 10 minutes after a disaster is reported,
while a second contingency group will depart for the areas three hours later,"
he added.</P>
      <P>The military has also investigated the status of idle and still usable military
barracks in various cities and counties, and has planned 34 shelters in 22
cities and counties able to accommodate around 14,000 disaster victims.</P>
      <P>Huang said the military "has reviewed its rescue operations during Typhoon
Morakot in early August and has made major changes in its disaster prevention
and rescue methods."</P>
      <P>He added that in future, the ranks of military personnel stationed at the
Central Emergency Operation Center will be upgraded and that additional staff
will be stationed there to be in charge of coordination with government
agencies, equipment, personnel dispatch and news dissemination.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Central Weather Bureau said that whether two approaching typhoons
-- Parma and Melor -- will make a direct hit on Taiwan was not yet certain, but
it predicted heavy rain for northern and eastern parts of Taiwan due to the
combined effect of the two typhoons and the northeasterly monsoon.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) forecast Friday that torrential rain will
affect northern and eastern Taiwan for a few days from Oct. 5 due to the
combined effect of two typhoons and the northeasterly monsoon.</P>
      <P>According to the weather bureau, Typhoon Parma was centered some 1,200 km
southeast of Taiwan as of 11 a.m. Friday, moving in a west-northwesterly
direction toward the island at a speed of 20 kph.</P>
      <P>The typhoon could move over the north of Luzon Island in the Philippines or
could sweep through the Bashi Channel over the next few days, depending on
atmospheric pressure changes over the Pacific, the CWB meteorologists forecast.</P>
      <P>Another typhoon, Melor, was even farther away from Taiwan as of news time,
moving also in a west-northwesterly direction but at a slower pace of 15 kph.</P>
      <P>"The typhoon could take a northerly direction and sweep toward Japan if the
Pacific high pressure system weakens further over the following several days, "
the meteorologists forecast.</P>
      <P>Whether either makes landfall in Taiwan will depend on changes in the Pacific
high pressure system, they said, although they forecast heavy rain for northern
and eastern parts of Taiwan due to the combined effect of the two typhoons and
the seasonal northeasterly monsoon.</P>
      <P>For central and southern Taiwan, they forecast cloudy weather but only a low
chance of torrential rain.</P>
      <P>Friday saw temperatures drop to a comfortable 26 degrees - 29 degrees Celsius
with sporadic showers under the impact of the northeasterly monsoon.
Temperatures ranged between 26 degrees and 32 degrees Celsius for central and
southern Taiwan, where there were sunny skies, with afternoon showers in
mountainous areas,  the forecasters said.</P>

      <P>The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) announced Friday that the 2011 U.S.
Diversity Immigrant Visa (DV) lottery will run from Oct. 3 to Dec. 1.</P>
      <P>"Due to anticipated high demand for the online application system, AIT
encourages participants to submit applications well before the lottery ends,"
the AIT said in a press release.</P>
      <P>According to the AIT, system delays in the past caused by extremely heavy demand
in the final days of the registration period have resulted in the failure of
some applicants to register for the program.</P>
      <P>While the system is being upgraded, overwhelming demand could cause delays and
therefore it is very important to apply early, as no entries will be accepted
after 1 a.m. Dec. 1, Taiwan time, regardless of whether there are system delays
during the registration period, it added.</P>
      <P>The only source for complete and authoritative information on eligibility
requirements and application procedures is available at www.dvlottery.state.gov,
according to the press release, adding that all applications  must be submitted
online according  to the instructions on the Web site and that this year,
entrants are required to submit an e-mail address with their applications.</P>
      <P>People born on the islands of Taiwan and Penghu are eligible to participate in
the DV program, while those born elsewhere should check the link
www.dvlottery.state.gov, according to the AIT.</P>
      <P>There is no fee for participating in the lottery and the U.S. Government employs
no outside consultants or private services to operate the program, the AIT said.</P>
      <P>Any intermediaries or others who offer assistance to prepare DV entries do so
without the authority  or consent of the U.S. Government, and use of any outside
intermediary or assistance to prepare a DV entry is entirely at the entrant's
discretion, it added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu said Friday that governments at both central and
local levels can enforce mandatory evacuations in the event of massive rainfall
and mudslides triggered by typhoons.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the possible threats posed by two approaching typhoons -- Parma and
Melor -- expected to begin affecting Taiwan late this weekend, Chu said
evacuations should be carried out immediately if the Central Emergency Operation
Center (CEOC) issues instructions in that regard.</P>
      <P>The evacuation of residents from areas threatened by typhoons and floods should
also be executed immediately if the local city or county government decides such
a course of action is necessary, Chu added.</P>
      <P>He also noted that weather forecasts by the Central Weather Bureau should not be
the only standard based on which the central and local governments make
decisions concerning emergency evacuations.</P>
      <P>On the possibility of conflicting opinions, such as if the CEOC calls for an
evacuation but the local government says it is unnecessary, Chu said the
evacuation will be mandatory so long as one government administration, whether
it be central or local, gives an evacuation order.</P>
      <P>"If the local government decides to issue an evacuation order, the central
government will support the local decision, " Chu stressed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he went on, in addition to wind strength, rainfall and mudslide
forecasts will also be used as a basis for whether to announce class or office
closures in the event of a serious typhoon.</P>
      <P>The vice premier made the remarks as a follow-up to remarks he made a day
earlier at a meeting on typhoon-induced  disaster prevention  and control
measures  in the wake of the massive devastation caused by Typhoon Morakot in
August.</P>
      <P>Morakot swept across the country in early August, triggering the worst flooding
and mudslides in half a century. Nearly 700 people died, including around 400
victims from Siaolin village in Kaohsiung County who were buried alive when
their village was inundated by mud.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan appreciates European Union's goodwill: official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The European Union's recent reiteration of support for Taiwan's "meaningful
participation" in international organizations demonstrates the organization's
goodwill toward the country, Republic of China Representative to the European
Union Shen Lyushun said in a phone call from Brussels Thursday.</P>
      <P>In particular, it would greatly improve Taiwan's ability to deal with natural
disasters if the country were to be admitted to the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO) , Shen told a CNA reporter based in Berlin.</P>
      <P>In a European Parliament session held Sept. 17, pro-Taiwan members of parliament
proposed that Taiwan -- which experienced the worst flooding in 50 years during
Typhoon Morakot in August -- should be allowed to take part in the WMO to
enhance the country's preparedness for extreme climate change as a result of
global warming.</P>
      <P>In response to the proposal, European Commission Commissioner Meglena Kuneva
said it remains the European Union's policy to support Taiwan's "meaningful
participation" in international organizations under "appropriate circumstances."</P>
      <P>Kuneva also promised that the European Union will consider Taiwan's request to
be included in the European Union's visa waiver program.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has not been represented at the United Nations since 1971, when the
Republic of China's seat was given to the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Since 1993, Taiwan has been trying -- unsuccessfully, due to Beijing's
objections -- to have the United Nations consider the issue of its
representation.</P>
      <P>In 2008, the country shifted its strategy to promoting a bid to "participate
meaningfully in the activities of specialized U.N. agencies, " in line with
President Ma Ying-jeou's "modus vivendi" diplomatic strategy that favors a
moderate and pragmatic approach.</P>
      <P>Following Taiwan's success in its bid to attend the World Health Assembly -- the
World Health Organization's decision-making arm -- as an observer for the first
time in May this year, the government has recently announced that the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO) will be the country's next targets for such
"meaningful participation."</P>
      <P>Explaining Taiwan's UNFCCC bid during a Cabinet meeting a day earlier, Premier
Wu Den-yih said the country's participation in the UNFCCC and the WMO is crucial
to strengthening its access to advanced climate technology and data.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A rare concert performed in a tunnel will be staged Oct. 18 on the outlying
island of Kinmen to mark the 60th anniversary of the battle of Kuningtou, in
which Kuomintang forces fought off attacking Chinese communists to maintain
control of the island, officials at the Kinmen National Park Headquarters said
Friday.</P>
      <P>The concert, which will take place inside the island's Chaishan Tunnel, will be
one of two "prayer for peace" shows organized by the park headquarters to
commemorate the anniversary. The other is scheduled for a day earlier at the
Kinmen County Stadium and will feature the Taipei Symphony Orchestra.</P>
      <P>The tunnel concert will feature cellist Chang Cheng-chieh, who will play his 319
-year-old Rugieri cello, soprano Mewas Lin, flautist Wu Tzung-hsien, violinist
Roger Chiang and harpist Hong Chi-mei, the officials said.</P>
      <P>A floating stage will move the musicians around an A-shaped waterway inside the
tunnel, the officials went on.</P>
      <P>In light of the unique characteristics of the venue, the concert will be open to
only 300 audience members aged 10 and older, they added.</P>
      <P>Those interested in attending are required to register in advance by calling the
park headquarters at (082) 313182 or by visiting its Web site at
www.kmnp.gov.tw.</P>
      <P>The battle of Kuningtou took place Oct. 25-27, 1949, when nearly 10,000
Communist troops in 200 ships invaded Kinmen as a prelude to seizing Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the fierce three-day battle, the invaders were repulsed, losing nearly 4,000
soldiers, with another 5,200 captured.</P>
      <P>The defeat of the communists brought a 10-year halt to Beijing's attempts to
take Taiwan by force. In 1958, they bombarded Kinmen, situated just kilometers
off China's southeastern coast, but were unable to seize any part of the Taiwan-
held island on that occasion either.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Friday that he would rather see residents in mudslide-
prone areas evacuated before a typhoon hits even if nothing happens later,
rather than risk disaster because people did not move.</P>
      <P>"It's like taking out an insurance policy against accidents, although the last
thing one would want is to become a claimant, " Wu said at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>He called for residents in areas that are under threat from typhoons and floods
to comply with any evacuation order issued either by the central or local
governments.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks in response to a question by ruling Kuomintang
Legislator Chen Chieh on the government's state of preparedness as two
approaching typhoons -- Parma and Melor -- are expected to begin affecting
Taiwan late this weekend or early next week.</P>
      <P>Wu said that in addition to wind velocity warnings by the Central Weather
Bureau, rainfall and mudslide forecasts will also be used to determine whether
schools and offices should be closed during a typhoon.</P>
      <P>In the future, the Central Weather Bureau, the Soil and Water Conservation
Bureau under the Council of Agriculture, the National Science Council's Disaster
Research Center and the Air Force Weather Wing will work closely to monitor
storm situations and related information, he added.</P>
      <P>In response to a question by opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator
Hsueh Ling, the premier said that if there is any repeat of the mudslide
casualties and heavy infrastructure damage that occurred in early August when
Typhoon Morakot struck, officials found guilty of negligence will be penalized.</P>
      <P>According to the Central Weather Bureau, Parma and Melor -- which were still far
southeast of Taiwan as of Friday -- had both increased in strength and were
moving in a west-northwesterly direction toward the island.</P>
      <P>The weather bureau warned the Taiwan public to be on the alert, saying that the
outer bands of the typhoons could converge with the northeasterly monsoon,
bringing torrential rain to northern and eastern parts of the country from late
this weekend.</P>

      <P>National Basketball Association (NBA) players in Taipei next week for an
exhibition game will coach children affected by Typhoon Morakot for a day, the
Taiwan chapter of the Christian charity organization World Vision announced
Friday.</P>
      <P>"As the first ever NBA game in Taipei is creating excitement across Taiwan, a
group of children currently facing adversity but still embracing their
basketball dreams will be given a once in a lifetime opportunity to learn from
professional basketball players in an NBA basketball clinic in Taipei on Oct. 7,
" World Vision Taiwan said in a press release.</P>
      <P>Retired San Antonio Spurs defensive star Bruce Bowen, Indiana Pacers star Danny
Granger, and his Pacers teammates will pass on their shooting, passing and
dribbling skills to 82 World Vision sponsored children, according to the charity
organization.</P>
      <P>The children, aged 12-14, are from indigenous communities in typhoon-stricken
Chiayi County and other areas that have struggled against poverty or suffered
severe property losses during Typhoon Morakot, which devastated southern Taiwan
Aug. 7-10.</P>
      <P>The basketball clinic is part of the NBA Cares program that promotes social
responsibility and community charity. NBA Cares chose to work with World Vision
Taiwan because the two share a concern for child welfare.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will host an NBA game for the first time when the Denver Nuggets and
Indiana Pacers play an exhibition game at Taipei Arena Oct. 8, a breakthrough
for a country in which the NBA has a devoted following.</P>
      <P>Taipei will become the 8th Asian city to host an NBA exhibition or regular
season game. Japan's Tokyo, Yokohama and Saitama hosted six regular season two-
game series between 1990 and 2003, while exhibitions have been held in recent
years in Beijing, Guangzhou, Macau, and Shanghai.</P>

      <P>Ending a three-day rally, Taiwan's share prices tumbled Friday, with the
weighted index, the market's key barometer, dropping 133.41 points, or 1.76
percent, to close at 7,411.88.</P>
      <P>Following a fall on Wall Street overnight, the local bourse opened lower at
7,415.16 but then rose to the day's high of 7,483.43 as investors picked up
bargains.</P>
      <P>Dragged down by the weak showings of plastics, tourism, textile and paper
shares, the market later retreated to 7,391.63 before rebounding slightly at the
end of the session.</P>
      <P>A total of 4.03 billion shares changed hands on market turnover of NT$116.04
billion (US$3.59 billion).</P>
      <P>All eight major stock categories lost ground, with plastics and chemicals stocks
falling the most at 2.57 percent. Textile shares fell 2.39 percent, paper and
pulp issues dropped 2.33 percent, machinery and electronics shares declined 1.77
percent, foodstuff issues shed 1.29 percent, banking and financial stocks
dropped 1.22 percent, construction shares lost 0.93 percent, and cement stocks
were down 0.81 percent.</P>
      <P>Losers outnumbered gainers 1,905 to 550,  with 190 stocks remaining unchanged.</P>
      <P>Foreign institutional investors were net sellers of NT$13.13 billion worth of
shares.</P>
      <P>They had bought a net NT$144.2 billion in shares in September, helping drive up
the Taiex by more than 10 percent for the month, but followed the bearish mood
in the market Friday.</P>
      <P>One analyst predicted that following the market's recent gains, the Taiex may
head lower and is likely to fluctuate between 7,384 and 7,000.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Friday:</P>
      <P>Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>A flip-flopping government</P>
      <P>Flip-flops are a bane to policymakers, but the Taiwan government made an about-
face on two projects recently, causing public uproar.</P>
      <P>The first was the Presidential Office's plan to tighten regulations pertaining
to the height of buildings in the area adjacent to the presidential residence in
downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>The plan was opposed by estate developers and was later scrapped by the
Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The second was a proposal to add three stops to the Taiwan High Speed Railway
service. Premier Wu Den-yih said that the plan had to be shelved because the
railway company was in financial straits.</P>
      <P>However, the minister of transportation and telecommunications reversed the
decision after politicians from the areas close to the proposed stops protested.
The three additional stations will be built before next January, the minister
said.</P>
      <P>The government is obviously been held hostage by local governments which are
controlled by businessmen who have set their sights on big profits from the
development of property near the proposed station sites.</P>
      <P>How can such a flip-flopping government not cause chaos?</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>When would China get rid of the red sea of giant pictures and</P>
      <P>slogans?</P>
      <P>Beijing is inundated by a red sea of giant pictures and slogans in celebration
of its national day. Beijing's celebrations stress collectivism and discipline,
which is in sharp contrast to Taiwan's focus on individualism and freedom in its
celebrations at the opening of the Kaoshsiung World Games and Taipei
Deaflympics.</P>
      <P>Chinese President Hu Jintao repeated Mao Zedong's declaration that "the Chinese
people have stood up." However, we have to point out that while China may have
stood up, its people have not, as they are still far from being fully liberated.</P>
      <P>Hu said his country will stick to the "Chinese version of socialism." Everyone
knows this is a lie. China has already deviated from socialism and is on the
path of capitalism.</P>
      <P>"The Chinese version of socialism" is only a pretext used by China to justify
its Communist dictatorship.</P>
      <P>From the perspective of Mao Zedong's teachings, China's 1.3 billion people are
all capitalists and should don tall paper hats and parade on the streets.</P>
      <P>Hu's calls for liberation of thought is what really makes the point. If China
had stuck to the dogma of communism, it could not have risen to the glory it has
today. The Chinese people would never enjoy freedom and democracy unless they're
liberated from the shackles of the Chinese version of socialism.</P>
      <P>Taiwan may not be China's match in terms of national power, but its people enjoy
far greater liberty and democracy than the Chinese.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>How could voters give their mandate to these people?</P>
      <P>China's celebration of its national day has nothing to do with Taiwan, but some
Taiwanese bigwigs scrambled to angle an invitation to join the celebration in
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Those people include some of President Ma Ying-jeou's national policy advisers
and business tycoons.</P>
      <P>They have forgotten that China has never given up its designs on Taiwan and is
threatening to take over the island using force.</P>
      <P>By retaining those pro-China advisers, President Ma has showed that his
administration is skewed toward Beijing.</P>
      <P>As to those business tycoons who visited Beijing to show their friendship toward
China, they have betrayed the island that fosters them.</P>
      <P>How can we trust our country to these people? We can change this by denying them
our votes in forthcoming elections.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Administration's bane is shooting itself in the foot</P>
      <P>The ruling team is always the target of fault-finding by the opposition, but
President Ma Ying-jeou's administration is lucky because it rules while the
opposition's strength is at its lowest ebb.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately Ma's ruling team often digs holes for itself, making controversies
out of nothing. This could be an indication of Ma's defective decision-making
ability.</P>
      <P>Following are two recent examples of Ma's ability to create a fuss over nothing:</P>
      <P>The first is the choice of the CNA chairman. This was a decision of little
significance, but the authorities nonetheless managed to flip-flop over a
decision for 24 hours, first naming an unknown 42-year-old writer to head the
agency, only to change their minds and replace him with a 77-year-old.</P>
      <P>The ruling team offered no explanation for the abrupt change.</P>
      <P>Another more notable example was a plan to tighten height restrictions on
buildings in the area adjacent to the president's official residence, as the
administration believes a skyscraper erected near the residence poses a security
threat.</P>
      <P>The plan, initiated by the Presidential Office, was eventually scrapped after
causing discord between the office and the Taipei city government.</P>
      <P>Although the Presidential Office claimed that it and City Hall were at cross
purposes, everybody knows that City Hall is not in a position to recommend such
changes.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, permission to build the skyscraper in question was granted by Ma
himself during his term as mayor of Taipei.</P>
      <P>If the skyscraper really poses a security risk, why not just relocate the
residence. No-one will believe the flip-flop was caused by anyone other than
Ma's ruling team, which should be blamed for this bungle.</P>
      <P>Ma should improve his decision-making procedure and stop causing such storms in
a tea cup.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) expressed appreciation Thursday for the
support of Taiwan's diplomatic allies for the country's efforts to seek
meaningful participation in United Nations specialized agencies.</P>
      <P>According to a MOFA press release, a total 15 head of states or representatives
of Taiwan's 23 diplomatic allies spoke in favor of Taiwan at the Sept. 23-30
General Debate of the 64th U.N. General Assembly.</P>
      <P>They are Palau, the Marshall Islands, Kiribati, Nauru, Burkina Faso, Sao Tome
and Principe, Gambia, Tuvalu, St. Christopher and Nevis, Swaziland, the Solomon
Islands, Belize, Nicaragua, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.</P>
      <P>Samuel S.M. Kuo, deputy director-general of MOFA's Department of African
Affairs, said at a regular press briefing Thursday that Fradique de Menezes,
president of Sao Tome and Principe; Yahya Jammeh, president of Gambia; Blaise
Compaore, president of Burkina Faso; and King Mswati III of Swaziland voiced
support on Sept. 24 and 25 for Taiwan's U.N. bid.</P>
      <P>They said that Taiwan will make significant contributions to the U.N.
specialized agencies, which at the same time will also benefit from Taiwan's
participation, according to Kuo.</P>
      <P>The also called on the world to consider Taiwan's legitimate right to
participate in international organizations, he added.</P>
      <P>The MOFA announced Sept.  21 that Taiwan will strive for membership in U.N.
specialized  agencies,  rather than direct participation in the U.N. as it had
been pursuing in previous years.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will seek meaningful participation in the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO) , the MOFA said, calling for the two agencies to give
favorable consideration to the needs of Taiwan's people and what they could
contribute if admitted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has not been represented in the U.N. since 1971, when the Republic of
China's seat was given to the Peoples Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Since 1993, it has been trying to have the world body consider the issue of its
representation, but has made little progress largely due to China's obstruction.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's allies and supporters have been trying to get the General Assembly to
list Taiwan's application for admission on the U.N. agenda, but Beijing's claim
that Taiwan is part of China has prevailed.</P>
      <P>This year, the Taiwan government has come up with a more flexible and pragmatic
approach that it hopes will allow it to better negotiate the complex situation.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that Taiwan will first enter the ICAO as an observer this fall, and
then gain admission to the UNFCCC after December this year, according to the
MOFA.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier questioned on CAL chairman's presence at parade in Beijing</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The attendance of Philip Wei, the chairman of Taiwan's national carrier China
Airlines (CAL) , at China's National Day parade Thursday was inappropriate,
Premier Wu Den-yih said on Friday.</P>
      <P>If an incumbent official or the leader of a state-run company attended the
parade, "I would see such an act as inappropriate," but things would be
different if it's a retired government servant, Wu said.</P>
      <P>He added, however, that he wanted to understand what really happened before
commenting further.</P>
      <P>Wu's remarks were made in response to a question from opposition Democratic
Progressive Party Legislator Hsueh Ling on whether the Cabinet should remove Wei
after he answered Beijing's invitation to attend its national day parade in his
capacity as the chairman of Taiwan's state-controlled carrier.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China have been bitter rivals since the end of China's civil war in
1949 when the Kuomintang-led Republic of China regime lost the war to the
Communists and retreated to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under President Ma Ying-jeou, relations between the two countries have improved,
but many in Taiwan are uneasy over the rapid pace of the rapprochement,  with
some criticizing  the government  for surrendering Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Those raw nerves were touched when it was learned that three of the president's
national policy advisers planned to attend China's Oct. 1 parade, and Wei's
presence has also been questioned.</P>
      <P>Asked what he thought of China's militaristic national day celebration, the
premier said "we don't have any reason to interfere" in how a country celebrates
its national festivals.</P>
      <P>He urged, however, that the development of peaceful relations between the two
sides across the Taiwan Strait, which people of the two sides had make great
efforts to achieve, be preserved.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wei, who returned to Taiwan earlier Friday, told the Central News
Agency that he participated in China's celebration as a matter of courtesy after
receiving an invitation from the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office.</P>
      <P>"CAL is a private company, and I am not a civil servant, so there is no need for
me to inform the government in advance of my activities," Wei argued.</P>
      <P>He said that through the opening of direct trade, postal, and transportation
cross-strait links, the carrier's planes have flown to China and business with
the mainland has grown.</P>
      <P>"With good interactions between the two sides, answering the invitation was
based on courtesy," Wei said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>National Palace Museum pieces will not be loaned to China: director</HEADLINE>

      <P>National treasures at the Taipei-based National Palace Museum (NPM) will not be
exhibited in China because that country does not have a law to prevent the
seizure of artworks, NPM Director Chou Kung-shin said Friday.</P>
      <P>The NPM collections are national assets and if they are to be exhibited abroad,
it will be only in countries that have laws that guarantee the return of the
exhibits, Chou said.</P>
      <P>"As long as there are no such legal protections in China, the NPM will not
consider loaning the national treasures to that country, " Chou said.</P>
      <P>The NPM director made the remarks at a news conference held at the museum Friday
to mark the arrival of 37 pieces of art that are on loan from the Palace Museum
in Beijing. The pieces will be included in an exhibition on Emperor Yongzheng --
the fourth ruler of the Manchu Qing Dynasty -- which will held at the NPM from
Oct. 7 to Jan. 10, 2010.</P>
      <P>The exhibition will feature 246 artworks related to Yongzheng, including 203
items from the NPM's Qing Dynasty collections, two from the Shanghai Museum,
three from Academia Sinica and one owned by a Taipei-based pharmaceutical
company.</P>
      <P>Of the artworks from China is a seal that was used by Emperor Yongzheng, which
bears three Chinese characters that read, "It's hard to be a king."</P>
      <P>Yongzheng ruled China for 13 years from 1722 to 1735. He was known as a tough
and hard-working emperor who opposed corruption and was bent on clean, effective
government. During his reign, the Manchu Empire became a great and peaceful
power.</P>
      <P>Yongzheng's private life was a sad one. He had nine children but only three
survived. He died mysteriously at the age of 58. He was succeeded by his son,
Prince Hong Li, who became the fifth emperor of the Qing dynasty under the name
Emperor Qianlong.</P>
      <P>At Friday's press conference, Chou said the joint exhibition was made possible
after her "ice-breaking" visit to China's Palace Museum in Beijing in February
-- the first of its kind in 60 years -- and a reciprocal visit in March by Zheng
Xinmiao, director of the Beijing museum.</P>
      <P>During the visits, Chou said, they discussed matters regarding cross-strait
cooperation on a joint Yongzheng exhibition.</P>
      <P>The exhibition was also possible because of Taiwan's legislation in 1992 of the
Statute on Encouraging and Rewarding Cultural and Art Enterprises, Chou said.</P>
      <P>"Under that statute, the exhibits from the museums in Beijing and Shanghai will
be exempt from seizure or any legal entanglements over ownership," she added.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's art and cultural objects could also be displayed in China once a
similar statute is put in place there to grant them the same protection," she
said.</P>
      <P>The NPM has the world's largest collection of Chinese historical artifacts,
totaling more than 700,000 pieces.</P>
      <P>Most of the items were removed from the Beijing Palace Museum in the 1930s to
prevent the collection from falling into the hands of the invading Japanese
army. They were later shipped to Taiwan when the Kuomintang-led Nationalist
troops lost the civil war in China to the Communists in 1949.</P>

      <P>A volunteer worker with the Hualien-based Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi
Foundation not only has a kind heart but also a clever mind that has allowed him
to create a smart gadget to help disaster victims, among others, maintain their
oral health.</P>
      <P>Chou Chin-yuan, who was a truck driver before becoming a volunteer for the Tzu
Chi Foundation after retiring, has invented a portable dental equipment case
dubbed the "Tzu Chi 007" due to its similarity to the 007 briefcase seen in the
famous James Bond films.</P>
      <P>"The health care environment in disaster zones is really bad. I hope that this
'Tzu Chi 007' can help those affected by disasters benefit from more efficient
medical services," he said.</P>
      <P>Chou made the original version of his case in 2001, capitalizing on his
expertise in machinery and rich volunteer experience to develop a dental
equipment case based on a model originally invented by a dentist in Tzu Chi's
U.S. headquarters.</P>
      <P>After modifying the case throughout the decade, Chou recently developed the
fourth generation of the portable product that weighs 12.2 kilograms and
measures 45 centimeters long, 33 cm wide and no more than 20 cm deep.</P>
      <P>This latest version, resulting from intensive consultations with dentists and
manufacturers over the past three years, has wheels and can be carried aboard a
plane or conveniently brought to disaster zones.</P>
      <P>"As a volunteer worker who travels around with a group to offer charitable
health care to underprivileged people, I find that normal dental equipment
occupies nearly two-thirds of a cargo truck's space and decided to work out a
solution to the problem, " he said.</P>
      <P>The portable dental kit contains a set of miniature dental instruments and
equipment, including a dental handpiece, dental scaler, dental light, and dental
halogen lamp.</P>
      <P>"With 1,250 cc of water, a dentist can immediately start to work by simply
stepping on the kit's motor," Chou explained.</P>
      <P>Due to its portability and convenience, more than 80 kits have been used by
charitable organizations providing free dental services in countries such as
China, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and the Dominican
Republic.</P>
      <P>"I am happy to be able to use what I know to do something for people in need,"
he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China trying to monopolize say in Taiwan issue: scholar</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An expert on Taiwan-China relations said Friday that China has been trying to
monopolize say in the Taiwan issue despite the fact that the issue has become
one of international concern.</P>
      <P>Director Tsai Ming-yen of the National Chung Hsing University's Graduate
Institute of International Politics said at a Taipei seminar that Taiwan, China
and the United States all clearly understand that bilateral relations among any
two of them are deeply related to the third party, but China has been trying
very hard to dominate say on the Taiwan issue.</P>
      <P>While the world witnessed the stable development of Taiwan-China- U.S.
triangular relations, there are still uncertain factors that may impact the
future development of relations among the three parties, Tsai said at a seminar
on peace in the Asia-Pacific region, co-sponsored by the Academia Sinica's
Center for Humanities and Social Sciences and the Center for Asia-Pacific Area
Studies.</P>
      <P>Those factors include how the United States and China would manage their
"cooperative and competitive" relations, the military imbalance in the Taiwan
Straits which favors China, and China's refusal to renounce the use of force
against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tsai pointed out that after cross-strait relations improved and U.S.-China
cooperation increased, the sensitivity of the Taiwan issue has been reducing,
and is no longer a "political bargaining chip" for either Beijing or Washington
as far as U.S.-China relations are concerned.</P>
      <P>However, Tsai said although the Taiwan issue was not on the agenda of a
U.S-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue in July, Chinese State Councilor Dai
Bingguo stated in the meeting that " it's the core interests of China in
maintaining the integration of national territory."</P>
      <P>Dai's remarks, according to Tsai, indicate that Beijing continues to regard the
Taiwan issue as its core interest and will not yield any ground on this matter
while dealing with the United States.</P>
      <P>Liu Faitao, an associate research fellow with China Institute of International
Studies, said at the seminar that the United States has become less capable of
utilizing the Taiwan issue as a means to prevent or deter China as it had done
before, as a result of China's economic rise and the recent thaw in cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>Tsai urged Taiwan to pay greater attention to the change in the triangular
relations, especially how the U.S. would react to China's intent to monopolize
decision-making in the Taiwan issue and cross-strait relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Central government debt nearly NT$4 trillion: Finance Ministry</HEADLINE>

(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The central government's outstanding debt totaled NT$3.887 trillion (US$120.3
billion) as of the end of August, a figure that was relatively low based on the
country's gross domestic product (GDP), the Ministry of Finance said Friday.</P>
      <P>"The total debt as a percentage of GDP is 32.21 percent, making Taiwan's
financial status relatively healthy if compared to those of the United States.
Japan, and other countries, " the ministry said in a statement apparently issued
in response to a less flattering assessment by a lawmaker.</P>
      <P>Citing figures from the Ministry of Audit earlier in the day, Legislator Lu
Shiow-yen of the ruling Kuomintang said that if liabilities such as pension and
insurance obligations are factored in, then the government's overall debt
actually stood at NT$19.722 trillion at the end of 2008, or NT$860,000 per
capita.</P>
      <P>Focusing strictly on the current national debt without commenting directly on
future liabilities, the ministry said it had been accumulated as aresult of
borrowing to finance major infrastructure projects to advance national
development.</P>
      <P>These infrastructure projects, however, now represent NT$7.661 trillion, or
NT$333,000 per capita, in public assets, not to mention the increased employment
and economic growth to which the projects have contributed.</P>
      <P>In the 16 months since President Ma Ying-jeou was inaugurated, the government
has borrowed NT$222.5 billion to finance stimulus measures to increase economic
growth in the face of the global financial crisis, the ministry added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's financial status remains relatively "healthy" since its total debt as a
percentage of GDP was still lower than 170.5 percent in Japan (2008) , 47.1
percent in the United State (2007) , 66.6 percent in France (2007) , 40.8
percent in Germany (2007) and 86.7 percent in Singapore (2007), the ministry
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'Release of life' religious practice spurs big business: group</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In Taiwan, religious groups spend more than NT$200 million (US$6.19 million)
annually to engage in "release of life" rituals, which they practice 750 times
on average each year, according to the Environment and Animal Society of Taiwan
(EAST) Friday.</P>
      <P>People usually practice "fangsheng, " or "release of life, " when they fall ill,
have a miserable marriage or want to pray for wealth in their next life, the
EAST said in a statement on a recent survey on the practice in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Some Buddhism followers  believe that setting animals free increases their own
merit, which translates into a better rebirth. This has sparked a new profit-
making business in the religious market in Taiwan, the EAST said.</P>
      <P>The business is supported by a complete demand and supply system that operates
on the "symbiosis" between religious believers and hunters, breeders and
vendors, it added. However, this business not only hurts the animals that are
hunted or bred for sale to fangsheng adherents, but also causes damage to the
ecological system, it added.</P>
      <P>In the 2009 survey, EAST interviewed operators and staff of 484 local Buddhist
and Taoist temples and other groups that follow the teachings of esoteric
Buddhism.</P>
      <P>It found that 256 of the 388 respondent groups maintain the fangsheng practice,
while 98 have given it up, and 34 have not practiced it in a long time and are
not sure whether they will do so again.</P>
      <P>Seven of the groups that still practice fangsheng said they do so in foreign
countries, including China, Hong Kong, the United States, Canada, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Singapore, Nepal and India.</P>
      <P>Notably, an organization run by a Buddhist monk named Hai Tao was found to have
engaged in a total of 89 instances of fangsheng in Taiwan and 35 abroad in 2008,
according to the survey. This year, it has so far engaged in ritual freeing of
animals 75 times in Taiwan and 22 times overseas, the survey found.</P>
      <P>On average, it organized 10 rounds of activities a month for its members to free
animals, the EAST said, describing the Hai Tao group as a"super fangsheng
organization."</P>
      <P>Based on the survey, the EAST estimated that more than 200 million creatures are
used in Taiwan each year in the religious ritual and at least NT$200 million is
spent annually on such activities.</P>
      <P>Birds, fish, frogs, turtles and snakes are the most commonly used animals,
according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Turtledoves,  sparrows,  scaly-breasted munia,  and Japanese white-eye are the
most popular birds in the "release of life" activities because they are cheap
and can be easily caught in large numbers in the wild in Taiwan, the EAST said.</P>
      <P>It noted that the birds are often kept in tiny wooden cages before being
transferred to bird shops and that some of them usually die from shock in
captivity.</P>

      <P>Based on research showing that "exercise makes people smart," the Ministry of
Education (MOE) suggested Friday that elementary and junior high schools should
reinforce requirements that students stretch before starting their classes in
the morning.</P>
      <P>MOE Physical Education Department Director Wang Chun-chuan stated that many
scientific studies have shown that exercise helps boost the brain's vitality,
including one published  in the Journal of Physiology by a team of researchers
at National Cheng Kung University in May.</P>
      <P>The team found that the spatial or aversive learning and memory of laboratory
mice significantly improved after they were pushed to run on a treadmill or
wheel for one month. The conclusion was cited in a New York Times article
published Sept. 16 and triggered heated debate on the Internet.</P>
      <P>Citing the report, Wang suggested teachers lead students in doing stretching
exercises 30 minutes every morning, saying he believes such a practice will
enhance students' ability to learn.</P>

    <HEADLINE>As health insurance shortfall mounts, Yaung searches for funds</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang said Friday that Taiwan's
National Health Insurance system would face a deficit even bigger in 2010 than
the NT$55.4 billion expected this year and insisted that premiums had to go up.</P>
      <P>Yaung, answering questions at a hearing at the Legislative Yuan, said raising
premiums was not a question of whether he agreed with the idea or not but simply
something that was unavoidable, and he suggested raising premiums on high income
earners.</P>
      <P>The DOH chief was responding to criticism from opposition Democratic Progressive
Party Legislator Hsueh Ling, who accused the DOH of waffling on the issue of
whether premiums would be raised.</P>
      <P>Citing the conclusions made at a recent citizen's conference, Hsueh insisted
that "the national health insurance system must be maintained, " that
"government subsidies must not be slashed" and that "national health insurance
premiums cannot be hiked."</P>
      <P>Yaung disagreed with Hsueh's charge and made it clear that "the DOH has been
very clear in its stance on the issue."</P>
      <P>Although the DOH head acknowledged that the financially strapped National Health
Insurance system needs to be reformed to make it more cost-effective, Yaung
argued that the goal cannot be achieved if premiums are maintained at current
levels.</P>
      <P>According to Yaung, government subsidies have not only not fallen in the past
decade, they have gone up markedly for senior citizens as Taiwan's elderly
population has grown by 30 percent. The cost of caring for the elderly, he said,
is three times higher than for younger people.</P>
      <P>He also pointed to premium reductions  or exemptions  for low-income or slightly
above low-income households that affect 2.41 million people, or one-tenth of
Taiwan's population.</P>
      <P>Under such circumstances, Yaung told Hsueh, it was only natural that higher
income earners  pay a little  more to help the disadvantaged based on the health
insurance system's fundamental concept of having those with means assist those
less well off.</P>
      <P>Yaung said on Thursday that the health insurance premium rate, currently set at
4.55 percent of insurers' monthly salary up to a ceiling of NT$131,700
(US$4,052) per month would not be increased for the moment, but that the
premiums paid by high income earners would be hiked.</P>
      <P>Chu Tong-kuang, a deputy convener of a DOH task force on insurance premiums,
said Friday that the DOH intends to increase the income ceiling (NT$131,700) on
which premiums are calculated, as early as next week.</P>
      <P>The existing ceiling is 7.62 times higher than the minimum income basis,
NT$17,280, on which premiums are calculated, and the DOH would like to increase
the cap to 10-15 times the minimum.</P>
      <P>If a factor of 15 is adopted, the new ceiling would be set at around NT$260,000
per month and would increase monthly premium revenues by about NT$1 billion.
Moving the income ceiling higher would affect between 80,000-90,000 people, Chu
estimated.</P>
      <P>Among those affected would be doctors, accountants, lawyers, and business
executives, he said. The plan to raise the ceiling could be implemented at any
time and would not require legislative approval.</P>
      <P>Other legislators urged Yaung to recover premiums that Taipei and Kaohsiung
cities owe the Bureau of National Health Insurance to bridge the system's
shortfall.</P>
      <P>Yaung explained that recovering the money would not help the system financially
because money had already been borrowed from local banks to cover the amounts
owed, but he pledged that the money would be collected nonetheless.</P>
      <P>Taipei owes approximately NT$36.7 billion and Kaohsiung around NT$18.7 billion
in premium contributions they were supposed to make on behalf of people working
but not residing in their cities.</P>
      <P>The two municipalities argued that they were only liable to make premium
payments on behalf of city residents and took the case to court, but the courts
eventually rejected their argument and ordered them to pay the premiums due.</P>
      <P>Taipei in particular has dragged its feet in responding to the court order.</P>
      <P>Justice Minister Wang Ching-feng said Friday, however, that arrangements have
already been worked out with the two cities to repay the balance owed. Taipei
and Kaohsiung have agreed to repay what they owe over eight years and six years,
respectively.</P>

      <P>Influenza A (H1N1) , has claimed one more life in Taiwan, the Central Epidemics
Command Center (CECC) reported Friday.</P>
      <P>The victim, the 20th in Taiwan and the fourth in Taipei County, was a 10-year-
old girl with epilepsy who was hospitalized Tuesday after having a sudden bout
of seizures and developing a fever at school, according to Taipei County health
officials.</P>
      <P>The hospital tried to control her seizures by giving her emergency treatment but
did not give her the anti-viral drug Tamiflu for the swine flu. The girl was
declared dead on Wednesday because of cardiorespiratory failure, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>Only Thursday did a test report by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reveal
that a specimen taken showed she had the H1N1 virus, and her case was identified
as severe.</P>
      <P>According to the health officials, the girl had had seizures since she was five
months old. She was diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of two and took medicine
to control the problem, and medical experts believe that the swine flu
retriggered her seizures.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that the girl's older brother showed flu symptoms on Sept.
28 and tested positive for the H1N1 virus after seeking medical attention at a
clinic. He recovered, however, after taking Tamiflu.</P>
      <P>None of the girl's 30 classmates and teachers have shown swine flu symptoms, the
officials added.</P>
      <P>As of Thursday night, five more people were hospitalized with the H1N1 virus,
bringing the total number of patients hospitalized with the new flu strain to
311 since the outbreak began, including 19 fatalities, according to the CECC.</P>
      <P>Of that number, only 28 are still being treated in local hospitals, while the
other 264 have been discharged.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 249 classes in 173 schools around the country remained suspended
because of H1N1 infections among students.</P>
      <P>The number of affected classes dropped to 0.16 percent of the total, from 0.32
percent a week ago, according to the CECC.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou on Friday urged Cabinet members to work with local
governments over the weekend on disaster prevention and control.</P>
      <P>The president asked the premier, the vice premier, and heads of related
government agencies to travel to cities and counties as the nation is on high
alert against two approaching typhoons -- Parma and Melor -- even if the weekend
is the Mid-Autumn holiday.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while presiding over a meeting at the Presidential Office
amid reports that two typhoons could bring heavy rains.</P>
      <P>He reminded the participants that when disaster strikes, the number of people in
the affected areas and people will usually be greater than the number of
rescuers. If that is the case, it will be impossible to provide satisfactory
assistance to every one.</P>
      <P>If the emergency hotline 119 is inundated, the people will call the media and if
the media air their calls for help, then the public would ask "whether is our
government? Why isn't it engaged in rescue efforts?"</P>
      <P>"If that is the case, it will be a repeat of what took place in Typhoon Morakot,
" Ma said, adding that "the best way is a well-prepared disaster-fighting team,
which will deploy forces in the risk-prone areas immediately."</P>
      <P>If the public, especially those in the remote areas, can see military forces and
firefighters in the vicinity, they will be more at ease, he said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the tremendous property damages and nearly 700 lives lost
during Morakot resulted in the resignation of former Premier Liu Chao-shiuan.</P>
      <P>"This is for the government a very serious matter, which will not be allowed to
be repeated again," he affirmed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile. the Central Weather Bureau said that although the strength of Parma
has been downgraded from a super typhoon, there will be heavy rains starting
Sunday, especially in northern and eastern parts of Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Electronic shackles considered in detention system change</HEADLINE>

10/02/09  23:54:29

    <TEXT>
      <P>Judicial authorities are considering allowing criminal defendants to wear
electronic shackles instead of having to be held in detention centers after they
have been indicted, the Judicial Yuan said Friday.</P>
      <P>The change in the nation's detention system would be made possible by an
amendment to the Criminal Procedure Law, which has yet to be enacted, said Liu
Ling-chi, director of the Judicial Yuan's Criminal Department.</P>
      <P>The new system is aimed at safeguarding defendants' human rights while
preventing them from fleeing before courts have the chance to deliver their
verdicts.</P>
      <P>According to the Criminal Procedure Law, judges have only two options for people
indicted for crimes carrying minimum sentences of five years -- to either detain
the defendant or release the individul on bail.</P>
      <P>Under the new system, electronic devices monitoring the movement of shackle-
wearing suspects will be installed in the police bureaus of counties and cities
to prevent defendants from escaping.</P>
      <P>There have been several cases in which indicted individuals who were released on
bail fled abroad, triggering public outcries for the government to consider a
change in the detention system.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, under the planned amendment to the Criminal Procedure Law, the length
of detention would also be shortened to fewer than two months for persons of
interest being investigated by prosecutors, and to no more than 15 months for
those on trial in the district and higher courts.</P>
      <P>The current Criminal Procedure Law gives prosecutors the right to detain
suspected criminals for four months at most before they decide whether or not to
hand down indictments.</P>
      <P>During trials in district and high courts, the indicted are subject to an
initial detention of three months, and their detention can be extended three
times for an additional total of six months. Detention periods are unlimited for
those, who if found guilty, are sentenced to death or to jail terms of over 10
years.</P>
      <P>Judicial authorities have been accused of abusing their power in detaining
former President Chen Shui-bian, who was sentenced to life in jail by the Taipei
District Court on Sept. 11 on charges of corruption, forgery and money-
laundering.</P>
      <P>The ex-president, who has appealed his case to the higher court, was first
detained Nov. 12 last year and was released Dec. 13 following his indictment by
prosecutors.</P>
      <P>He was detained again Dec. 30 the same year after the Taipei District Court
approved a request by prosecutors to take him back into custody, and has not
been released since then.</P>

income earners  pay a little  more to help the disadvantaged based on the health
insurance system's fundamental concept of having those with means assist those
less well off.</P>
      <P>Yaung said on Thursday that the health insurance premium rate, currently set at
4.55 percent of insurers' monthly salary up to a ceiling of NT$131,700
(US$4,052) per month would not be increased for the moment, but that the
premiums paid by high income earners would be hiked.</P>
      <P>Chu Tong-kuang, a deputy convener of a DOH task force on insurance premiums,
said Friday that the DOH intends to increase the income ceiling (NT$131,700) on
which premiums are calculated, as early as next week.</P>
      <P>The existing ceiling is 7.62 times higher than the minimum income basis,
NT$17,280, on which premiums are calculated, and the DOH would like to increase
the cap to 10-15 times the minimum.</P>
      <P>If a factor of 15 is adopted, the new ceiling would be set at around NT$260,000
per month and would increase monthly premium revenues by about NT$1 billion.
Moving the income ceiling higher would affect between 80,000-90,000 people, Chu
estimated.</P>
      <P>Among those affected would be doctors, accountants, lawyers, and business
executives, he said. The plan to raise the ceiling could be implemented at any
time and would not require legislative approval.</P>
      <P>Other legislators urged Yaung to recover premiums that Taipei and Kaohsiung
cities owe the Bureau of National Health Insurance to bridge the system's
shortfall.</P>
      <P>Yaung explained that recovering the money would not help the system financially
because money had already been borrowed from local banks to cover the amounts
owed, but he pledged that the money would be collected nonetheless.</P>
      <P>Taipei owes approximately NT$36.7 billion and Kaohsiung around NT$18.7 billion
in premium contributions they were supposed to make on behalf of people working
but not residing in their cities.</P>
      <P>The two municipalities argued that they were only liable to make premium
payments on behalf of city residents and took the case to court, but the courts
eventually rejected their argument and ordered them to pay the premiums due.</P>
      <P>Taipei in particular has dragged its feet in responding to the court order.</P>
      <P>Justice Minister Wang Ching-feng said Friday, however, that arrangements have
already been worked out with the two cities to repay the balance owed. Taipei
and Kaohsiung have agreed to repay what they owe over eight years and six years,
respectively.</P>

      <P>Influenza A (H1N1) , has claimed one more life in Taiwan, the Central Epidemics
Command Center (CECC) reported Friday.</P>
      <P>The victim, the 20th in Taiwan and the fourth in Taipei County, was a 10-year-
old girl with epilepsy who was hospitalized Tuesday after having a sudden bout
of seizures and developing a fever at school, according to Taipei County health
officials.</P>
      <P>The hospital tried to control her seizures by giving her emergency treatment but
did not give her the anti-viral drug Tamiflu for the swine flu. The girl was
declared dead on Wednesday because of cardiorespiratory failure, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>Only Thursday did a test report by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reveal
that a specimen taken showed she had the H1N1 virus, and her case was identified
as severe.</P>
      <P>According to the health officials, the girl had had seizures since she was five
months old. She was diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of two and took medicine
to control the problem, and medical experts believe that the swine flu
retriggered her seizures.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that the girl's older brother showed flu symptoms on Sept.
28 and tested positive for the H1N1 virus after seeking medical attention at a
clinic. He recovered, however, after taking Tamiflu.</P>
      <P>None of the girl's 30 classmates and teachers have shown swine flu symptoms, the
officials added.</P>
      <P>As of Thursday night, five more people were hospitalized with the H1N1 virus,
bringing the total number of patients hospitalized with the new flu strain to
311 since the outbreak began, including 19 fatalities, according to the CECC.</P>
      <P>Of that number, only 28 are still being treated in local hospitals, while the
other 264 have been discharged.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 249 classes in 173 schools around the country remained suspended
because of H1N1 infections among students.</P>
      <P>The number of affected classes dropped to 0.16 percent of the total, from 0.32
percent a week ago, according to the CECC.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou on Friday urged Cabinet members to work with local
governments over the weekend on disaster prevention and control.</P>
      <P>The president asked the premier, the vice premier, and heads of related
government agencies to travel to cities and counties as the nation is on high
alert against two approaching typhoons -- Parma and Melor -- even if the weekend
is the Mid-Autumn holiday.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while presiding over a meeting at the Presidential Office
amid reports that two typhoons could bring heavy rains.</P>
      <P>He reminded the participants that when disaster strikes, the number of people in
the affected areas will be greater than the number of rescuers. If that is the
case, it will be impossible to provide satisfactory assistance to every one.</P>
      <P>If the emergency hotline 119 is inundated, the people will call the media and if
the media air their calls for help, then the public would ask "where is our
government? Why isn't it engaged in rescue efforts?"</P>
      <P>"If that is the case, it will be a repeat of what took place in Typhoon Morakot,
" Ma said, adding that "the best way is a well-prepared disaster-fighting team,
which will deploy forces in the risk-prone areas immediately."</P>
      <P>If the public, especially those in the remote areas, can see military forces and
firefighters in the vicinity, they will be more at ease, he said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the tremendous property damages and nearly 700 lives lost
during Morakot resulted in the resignation of former Premier Liu Chao-shiuan.</P>
      <P>"This is for the government a very serious matter, which will not be allowed to
be repeated again," he affirmed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile. the Central Weather Bureau said that although the strength of Parma
has been downgraded from a super typhoon, there will be heavy rains starting
Sunday, especially in northern and eastern parts of Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Judicial authorities are considering allowing criminal defendants to wear
electronic shackles instead of having to be held in detention centers after they
have been indicted, the Judicial Yuan said Friday.</P>
      <P>The change in the nation's detention system would be made possible by an
amendment to the Criminal Procedure Law, which has yet to be enacted, said Liu
Ling-chi, director of the Judicial Yuan's Criminal Department.</P>
      <P>The new system is aimed at safeguarding defendants' human rights while
preventing them from fleeing before courts have the chance to deliver their
verdicts.</P>
      <P>According to the Criminal Procedure Law, judges have only two options for people
indicted for crimes carrying minimum sentences of five years -- to either detain
the defendant or release the individul on bail.</P>
      <P>Under the new system, electronic devices monitoring the movement of shackle-
wearing suspects will be installed in the police bureaus of counties and cities
to prevent defendants from escaping.</P>
      <P>There have been several cases in which indicted individuals who were released on
bail fled abroad, triggering public outcries for the government to consider a
change in the detention system.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, under the planned amendment to the Criminal Procedure Law, the length
of detention would also be shortened to fewer than two months for persons of
interest being investigated by prosecutors, and to no more than 15 months for
those on trial in the district and higher courts.</P>
      <P>The current Criminal Procedure Law gives prosecutors the right to detain
suspected criminals for four months at most before they decide whether or not to
hand down indictments.</P>
      <P>During trials in district and high courts, the indicted are subject to an
initial detention of three months, and their detention can be extended three
times for an additional total of six months. Detention periods are unlimited for
those, who if found guilty, are sentenced to death or to jail terms of over 10
years.</P>
      <P>Judicial authorities have been accused of abusing their power in detaining
former President Chen Shui-bian, who was sentenced to life in jail by the Taipei
District Court on Sept. 11 on charges of corruption, forgery and money-
laundering.</P>
      <P>The ex-president, who has appealed his case to the higher court, was first
detained Nov. 12 last year and was released Dec. 13 following his indictment by
prosecutors.</P>
      <P>He was detained again Dec. 30 the same year after the Taipei District Court
approved a request by prosecutors to take him back into custody, and has not
been released since then.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Relations with China, U.S. challenge for new Taiwan Cabinet: AmCham</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Skillful managing of cross-Taiwan Strait economic relations and continuing to
strengthen relations with the United States are among the challenges for
Taiwan's new Cabinet, according to a Taipei-based U.S. trade group.</P>
      <P>The American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Taipei made the remarks in the
September issue of its monthly publication, Topics, saying that the new
government of Premier Wu Den-yih will face a host of challenges, starting with
the need to prove its competence and efficiency in carrying out reconstruction
in the areas hard-hit by Typhoon Morakot in early August.</P>
      <P>"The former Cabinet was replaced because it evidently did not meet the high
demands and expectations of the Taiwan public. It will now be up to Premier Wu
and his ministers to show that they are up to the task," according to a Topics
editorial.</P>
      <P>In moving ahead on a proposed Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA)
with China, the government will need to make the case more clearly to the public
on why such a pact is so crucial to preserving and protecting Taiwan's export
markets in China and the region, according to the editorial.</P>
      <P>It adds that other topics that deserve to be high on the new Cabinet's  priority
list include  balancing  the advances  in cross-strait ties with further
strengthening of relations with the U.S. -- Taiwan's most important source of
international support -- continuing to pursue the aspiration of developing
Taiwan into a regional financial center, tackling the problem of insufficient
funding for the national health care system, and shoring up Taiwan's
international economic competitiveness.</P>
      <P>While the political environment in Washington makes it currently unfeasible for
the U.S. to begin negotiating a free trade agreement with any country, including
Taiwan, and discussion of a bilateral investment  agreement  has been stalled
because  of procedural complications, Taiwan and the U.S. could explore various
other mechanisms for broadening and deepening the economic relationship,
according to the editorial.</P>
      <P>"If that can be done, Taiwan would feel a greater sense of confidence and
security as it engages China," it says.</P>
      <P>On the financial aspect, the editorial contends that several proposed lows and
regulations  threaten to undermine  Taiwan's competitiveness in the banking,
insurance and assets management industries.</P>
      <P>It says the Executive Yuan, by liaising with the legislature and coordinating
between the Financial Supervisory Commission and the Ministry of Finance, is in
a position to ensure that Taiwan's attractiveness in the financial services
sector is not eroded.</P>
      <P>The editorial also warns that as long as hospitals in Taiwan are reliant for
their financial soundness on ever-larger discounts from the pharmaceutical and
medical device manufacturers,  Taiwanese patients' access to new and innovative
treatments will be restricted and Taiwan will be unable to draw the investment
needed to build a flourishing biotech industry.</P>
      <P>In  terms  of  improving  Taiwan's  international  economic competitiveness, the
editorial says this could be accomplished by improving the fairness,
transparency  and consistency  of the regulatory process, and by adhering to
international practices rather than trying to devise Taiwan-unique solutions.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei-based American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) has welcomed recent
policy changes made by the Taiwanese government on the retail, tax and transport
sectors, saying that the decisions have effectively resolved the protracted
issues covering a broad swathe of concerns.</P>
      <P>"Getting solutions to three issues for three different committees was a nice way
to end the summer, " AmCham President Andrea Wu was quoted as saying in the
September issue of the AmCham monthly publication, Topics.</P>
      <P>"Let's hope we can maintain a similar momentum through the rest of the year,"
she adds.</P>
      <P>Wu was referring to Taiwan's recent liberalization of imports from China by
removing tableware  from the banned list,  the clarification of the scope of
"Taiwan-sourced income" for income tax purposes, and allowing the use of
electronic invoices to help expedite express cargo shipments.</P>
      <P>The government's  prohibition  on imports  of made-in-China porcelain and china
tableware and kitchenware has been one of the priority items of the AmCham
Retail Committee for the past several years.</P>
      <P>According to the article, it was a particularly frustrating issue for the
committee because the rationale for the ruling appeared to be "nebulous, " since
although the local ceramics industry is not even equipped to produce Western-
style tableware in large quantities, the ceramics manufacturers association kept
objecting to any relaxation of the ban on Chinese imports.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Development Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs decided in
August to release the category as permissible for import.</P>
      <P>Regarding"Taiwan-sourced income," AmCham's Tax Committee has long appealed to
the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to clear up confusion over the tax treatment of
payments to overseas entities for services performed entirely offshore.</P>
      <P>In September, the MOF issued a ruling titled Guidelines for Determining Taiwan-
sourced Income as Defined under Article 8 of the Income Tax Law, that provides
just such clarification along the lines that the Chamber suggested, the article
says.</P>
      <P>For example, income earned by foreign enterprises that render services outside
Taiwan will not be considered Taiwan-sourced if the foreign enterprise has no
fixed location of business or agent in Taiwan -- or if there is a fixed location
or agent but they were not involved in providing the particular service
rendered.</P>
      <P>The third recent change, also announced in September by the MOF, came in the
form of revised Regulations Governing Customs Clearance Procedures for Express
Consignments.</P>
      <P>It states that paper invoices will no longer have to be attached to express
export shipments as long as the express cargo company possesses digital invoice
storage and retrieval systems and can provide Customs with immediate perusal and
printout of the relevant files when required.</P>
      <P>The revision was requested by AmCham's Transportation Committee, which noted
that it would enhance Taiwan's trade competitiveness and is also in line with a
paperless clearance project being promoted by the World Customs Organization.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou lauded Saturday the temporary housing units being
constructed for victims in Taitung County who were rendered homeless by Typhoon
Morakot.</P>
      <P>"The housing units are marvelously built, " said Ma upon entering one of the

      <P>He expressed appreciation for World Vision Taiwan, the charity organization that
solicited the money for the housing, as well as for High Tech Computer CEO Cho
Ho-tu for a generous donation his company made.</P>
      <P>The president, accompanied by Minister of Transportation and Communications Mao

Morakot reconstruction. Nearly 700 people died and thousands lost their homes
and property when the typhoon swept past Taiwan Aug. 7-9.</P>
      <P>Turning to the possible onslaught of approaching Typhoon Parma, Ma said that
disaster prevention comes before rescue and that the central government will
work closely with local governments to reduce the possibility of disaster.</P>
      <P>Earlier,  he had visited  workers  of the Taiwan  Railway Administration to
thank them for their speedy work to repair the Taimali section of the Southern

      <P>A 1-kilometer stretch of the line's foundations were swept away by the storm and
the repair work, originally estimated to take two months because of its
difficulty, was completed in half that time.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Mao and Taitung Magistrate Kuang Li-chen held the first meeting at
the county's emergency operations center, which was opened earlier that same

      <P>Mao instructed  the military and firefighters  to step up inspections in order

      <P>Satellite phone systems and other notification systems should be tested, he went

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) issued a land warning for the Hengchun
peninsula in southern Taiwan Sunday as medium Typhoon Parma continued its
approach to the country.</P>
      <P>Parma, with winds gusting up to 162 kilometers per hour, was 340 km south of
Oluanpi on the southernmost tip of Taiwan as of 5:30 a.m., moving in a north-
northwesterly direction at 7 kph, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>The typhoon slammed into the northern Philippines a day earlier, killing at
least three people there, according to foreign wire service reports.</P>
      <P>"Right now, Parma seems to be swirling in the Bashi Channel that separates
Taiwan and the Philippines and its speed is likely to slow down to 4 kph," said
Hsiao Chia-sen, a CWB forecaster.</P>
      <P>Over the next two or three days, Hsiao went on, the typhoon may move slowly and
hover around the Bashi Channel, but he added that further observation will be
needed to predict its course after that.</P>
      <P>He urged residents in the Hengchun area to take precautions against powerful
wind and heavy downpours.</P>
      <P>Residents in northern and eastern parts of Taiwan should also be on guard
against torrential rain brought by the typhoon, Hsiao added.</P>
      <P>The approaching typhoon comes less than two months after Typhoon Morakot, the
worst storm to hit the island in half a century, killed more than 600 and led to
a major Cabinet reshuffle due to lackluster government response in the initial
stages.</P>

    <HEADLINE>H1N1 vaccinations to be free: health official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 4 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Local citizens will not be required to pay for vaccination against swine flu,
officially known as influenza A(H1N1), a health official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>"The free-of-charge policy is aimed at encouraging people to receive
inoculations as soon as possible once the vaccination program is launched next
month, " said Chou Chih-hau, deputy director-general of the Centers for Disease
Control under the Department of Health (DOH).</P>
      <P>According to Chou, the DOH will offer NT$150 (US$4.63) per head in subsidies to
local health care institutions that offer H1N1 vaccinations.</P>
      <P>"The amount is enough to pay for registration fees and medical examination fees
for each citizen who receives H1N1 inoculation at designated hospitals, clinics
or health centers," Chou said.</P>
      <P>As more than 10 million people will be involved in various kinds of vaccinations
in the coming months, Chou said, the subsidy program for H1N1 vaccination is
expected to help speed up completion of the program.</P>
      <P>According to the DOH's plan, 5 million doses of H1N1 vaccine imported from
Switzerland-based pharmaceutical firm Novartis will be available for high-risk
individuals in late October, while 10 million doses to be supplied by local
manufacturer Adimmune Corp. will be ready in early November.</P>
      <P>As the two suppliers will deliver the doses in staggered shipments, the vaccines
will be administered simultaneously.</P>
      <P>The DOH-initiated priority list for H1N1 vaccination is led by typhoon-affected
victims, medical personnel in charge of disease control and prevention, and
pregnant women.</P>
      <P>They will be followed on the priority list by pre-school children, seriously ill
patients, elementary, junior and senior high school students, individuals in the
19-24 age bracket and those over 25 at high risk of cardiopulmonary disease,
healthy people in the 25-49 age bracket, and those aged between 50 and 64.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) reported Sunday that five
more patients had been hospitalized for severe H1N1 symptoms in the previous 24
hours, bringing the total hospitalization cases to 319 since the outbreak began.</P>
      <P>Of that number, 21 had died, 28 were still being treated in local hospitals,
while the other 270 had been discharged after making complete recoveries.</P>
      <P>The five newly hospitalized patients include one male and four females, aged
between 4 and 42.</P>
      <P>A CECC official said the center is keeping a close watch on the developments in
the H1N1 situation in the wake of the Mid-Autumn Festival.</P>
      <P>"The weather has been cooling off significantly in recent days and human
interaction has increased over the Mid-Autumn Festival, so we are monitoring
whether the two developments will have any impact on the H1N1 situation," the
official said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tremor does not predispose Taiwan to landslides: expert</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An earthquake that jolted Taiwan early Sunday has not predisposed the island to
more landslides, even if Typhoon Parma hits the island in the next few days, an
expert said later that day.</P>
      <P>Yen Hong-yuan, a professor of earth science at Central University in Chungli,
Taoyuan County, said the precipitation brought by Parma to eastern Taiwan had
not yet exceeded safety limits and was therefore unlikely to trigger landslides.</P>
      <P>He said the 6.3-magnitude temblor 23 km southeast of Hualien at 1: 36 a.m. was
"not abnormal."</P>
      <P>"Although it is the second temblor with a magnitude over 6 this year, the number
of earthquakes this year is within the normal range," he said.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Yen said, the precipitation caused by Typhoon Parma so far was less
than one-third of the nearly 3,000 mm of rainfall brought by Typhoon Morakot and
there were few slopes in eastern Taiwan predisposed to mudslides.</P>
      <P>"The fear that soil softened up by the temblor is more likely to slide after
sucking up water from rainfall is groundless, " Yen pointed out.</P>
      <P>As Typhoon Morakot, which triggered widespread landslides and killed more than
600 people in early August, has rammed home the importance of evacuating people
from mudslide-prone areas before torrential rain, Yen said he was confident that
the Morakot tragedy will not be repeated.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Parma was centered 310 km south-southwest of Taiwan's southernmost tip
of Eluanpi as of Sunday afternoon, moving slowly on a north-northwesterly
trajectory, according to the Central Weather Bureau.</P>

    <HEADLINE>More than 1,200 evacuated as Typhoon Parma nears</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 4 (CNA)
10/04/09  19:14:55
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 1,200 residents in mudslide-prone areas of four counties around the
nation had been evacuated as of 1 p.m. Sunday amid the threat of Typhoon Parma,
which was forecast to hit Taiwan after slamming into the Philippines the
previous day.</P>
      <P>"As of 1 p.m. Sunday, 1,241 residents in 10 townships and villages in four
counties -- Nantou, Chiayi, Kaohsiung and Pingtung -- had been evacuated over
mudslide concerns, " the Central Emergency Operations Center said in a
statement.</P>
      <P>The evacuation was part of the government's efforts to avoid a repeat of the
tragedy caused by Typhoon Morakot in early August, when the storm triggered
massive flooding and devastating landslides in southern Taiwan that buried
various mountain villages and left more than 700 people dead or missing.</P>
      <P>According to the center, rainfall spawned by Typhoon Parma was concentrated in
the mountains of northeastern Taiwan's Yilan County and the northern county of
Taipei.</P>
      <P>From Saturday midnight through 1 p.m. Sunday, 129.5 mm of precipitation had been
recorded in Juifang, Taipei County, with 124.5 mm in Yilan's Tatung township and
112 m.m. in the county's Tungshan township, center officials said.</P>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) originally predicted that Parma could bring up
to 1,100 mm of rainfall to Taiwan's mountainous regions, but later lowered the
forecast to 800 mm, with the mountains of northern and eastern Taiwan receiving
the worst of it.</P>
      <P>The bureau issued a land warning for Typhoon Parma for the Hengchun peninsula in
southern Taiwan at 5:30 a.m. Sunday.</P>
      <P>Since then, however, the storm had been swirling around in the Bashi Channel
that separates Taiwan from the Philippines and its speed had slowed to 4 kph.</P>
      <P>The CWB's typhoon report had not mentioned Parma's speed since 8: 30 a.m. that
day, with all follow-up reports saying only that the typhoon  was in the Bashi
Channel  and moving  slowly  on a west-northwesterly trajectory.</P>
      <P>CWB meteorologists said it was difficult to predict whether Typhoon Parma would
move east or west because several factors -- a high pressure system in South
Asia, a cold front from the north, a high pressure system in the Pacific Ocean
and another typhoon, Melor -- could affect its movement.</P>
      <P>Noting that Typhoon Melor was moving fast from southeast of Taiwan in a west-
northwesterly direction, the weathermen said Melor was likely to come closer
than 1,500 km to Parma over the next two days.</P>
      <P>By then, they said, a drag effect will appear between the two typhoons, although
they added that it remained to be seen whether Melor would drag Parma northeast
or southwest.</P>
      <P>Lee Ching-sheng, a meteorology professor at National Taiwan University,  echoed
the  CWB  weathermen's  views  on Parma's unpredictability, saying many factors
could affect its course.</P>
      <P>Whatever course the typhoon takes, however, the government was determined to
make every possible effort to minimize the chances of disaster.</P>
      <P>It had been taking precautionary measures since Saturday, with President Ma
Ying-jeou, Premier Wu Den-yih and other Cabinet members inspecting disaster
prevention and response preparations in coastal and mountainous areas and the
military assisting in evacuating mountain villagers.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot caused heavy human casualties and property damage in Taiwan and
led to a major Cabinet reshuffle, with Wu replacing Liu Chao-shiuan as premier.
Political analysts said Typhoon Parma will test the new Cabinet's competence and
operational efficiency.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Emergency Operations Center, which was opened the previous day to
brace for approaching Typhoon Parma, set up a hotline for emergency calls
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah, who serves as commander of the center,
announced the six-line (02) 8196-6999 hotline to the press that same day.</P>
      <P>However, he said members of the public who require help should first dial the
regular 119 emergency call and use the center's hotline only when the 119 line
is engaged or disconnected.</P>
      <P>"We will relay the calls for help to the relevant local authorities, so calls
for help might not be dealt with as fast as if people call 119 directly," said
Jiang.</P>
      <P>In order to avoid jamming the emergency lines, the minister suggested that the
public report disasters to local borough or village chiefs, who will compile the
information and relay it all together to the emergency centers operated by local
governments.</P>
      <P>The extra hotline was set up after people were reduced to calling local TV
channels to report disasters during the onslaught of Typhoon Morakot in early
August, complaining that the 119 line was always busy.</P>
      <P>The image of President Ma Ying-jeou's  administration  was tarnished by these
complaints, which was part of the reason for a Cabinet reshuffle in which former
Premier Liu Chao-shiuan stepped down.</P>
      <P>As of Sunday afternoon, Typhoon Parma was located 310 km south-southwest of
Taiwan's southernmost tip of Eluanpi, moving slowly on a north-northwesterly
trajectory, according to the Central Weather Bureau.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 34,584 military servicemen around Taiwan and on several outlaying
islands were ready to respond to calls for rescue and relief operations during
the onslaught of Typhoon Parma, the Ministry of National Defense said Sunday.</P>
      <P>In a press release, the ministry said it believed the deployments would meet any
local government demand for help.</P>
      <P>The forces were divided into five groups, with each of them responsible for an
operational area under the command of an ad hoc Armed Forces Emergency
Operations Center.</P>
      <P>The center will keep abreast of the latest developments of the storm, and will
order the servicemen to take action without waiting for approval from their
superiors, according to the press release.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of the approach of the typhoon, the ministry said it had
canceled leave for some servicemen 36 hours before the Central Weather Bureau
issued a land warning for southern Taiwan Sunday morning.</P>
      <P>Noting that it has made rescue and relief operations one of its main priorities,
the ministry said it will engage in the disaster relief operation as actively as
it would in a battle situation.</P>
      <P>The Defense Ministry was criticised for its slow response to local government
calls for help in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot, which ravaged parts of the
south of the island in early August.</P>
      <P>The poor response meant that former Defense Minister Chen Chao-min had to step
down in an ensuing Cabinet reshuffle.</P>
      <P>The armed forces efforts earned praise from Premier Wu Den-yih that day when he
made an inspection tour of a military command in Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>The premier noted that the armed forces have a lot of personnel and fleets of
excavators on standby and are ready to deploy them to diaster-prone areas as
soon as possible.</P>
      <P>"It will be a perfect anti-disaster drill even if Typhoon Parma doesn't prompt
any disaster," he said.</P>
      <P>"With the readiness of the people and the armed forces, I am certain that
whatever havoc Typhoon Parma may wreak, it will not be as serious as that caused
by Typhoon Morakot," he added.</P>

      <P>Braving windy and rainy weather, a dazzling dog parade took place in Taipei
Sunday as part of celebrations to mark World Animal Day.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that the Oct. 4 World Animal Day had been celebrated in
Taiwan with such fanfare.</P>
      <P>Although the approach of Typhoon Parma brought wind and rain to Taipei,  many
animal  rights  activists  took  part  in  the one-kilometer-long parade that
ended in front of Taipei City Hall.</P>
      <P>Many of the marchers were dogs decked out in colorful raincoats, head scalves
and other decorations.</P>
      <P>With a theme of opposing the abandoning of pets, gin traps and animal abuse, the
parade was complemented by a trade fair, with about 60 booths selling pet foods
and pet-care products.</P>
      <P>Organizers said 20 percent of proceeds from the sales would be donated to animal
protection groups in southern Taiwan that were hard-hit by Typhoon Morakot in
early August.</P>
      <P>Many animal protection  and rescue groups as well as pet veterinaries and
clinics and stray dog centers also put up booths at the site to promote their
cause.</P>
      <P>As the event was organized by Animals Taiwan, a protection and rescue group
founded by British expatriates in Taiwan, many foreign residents took part in
the event to throw their support for animal rights protection.</P>
      <P>The World Animal Day was started in 1931 at a convention of ecologists in
Florence, Italy as a way of highlighting the plight of endangered species.</P>
      <P>It was also the feast day of Saint Francis of Assisi, a Catholic deacon and the
founder of the Order of Friars Minor, more commonly known as the Franciscans. He
is known as the patron saint of animals and the environment, and it is customary
for Catholic churches to hold ceremonies honoring animals around his feast day

      <P>No elections will be held in Taipei County, Kaohsiung County, Taichung County,

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) issued a land warning for the Hengchun
peninsula in southern Taiwan Sunday as medium Typhoon Parma continued its
approach to the country.</P>
      <P>Parma, with winds gusting up to 162 kilometers per hour, was 340 km south of
Oluanpi on the southernmost tip of Taiwan as of 5:30 a.m., moving in a north-
northwesterly direction at 7 kph, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>The typhoon slammed into the northern Philippines a day earlier, killing at
least three people there, according to foreign wire service reports.</P>
      <P>"Right now, Parma seems to be swirling in the Bashi Channel that separates
Taiwan and the Philippines and its speed is likely to slow down to 4 kph," said
Hsiao Chia-sen, a CWB forecaster.</P>
      <P>Over the next two or three days, Hsiao went on, the typhoon may move slowly and
hover around the Bashi Channel, but he added that further observation will be
needed to predict its course after that.</P>
      <P>He urged residents in the Hengchun area to take precautions against powerful
wind and heavy downpours.</P>
      <P>Residents in northern and eastern parts of Taiwan should also be on guard
against torrential rain brought by the typhoon, Hsiao added.</P>
      <P>The approaching typhoon comes less than two months after Typhoon Morakot, the
worst storm to hit the island in half a century, killed more than 600 and led to
a major Cabinet reshuffle due to lackluster government response in the initial
stages.</P>

    <HEADLINE>H1N1 vaccinations to be free: health official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 4 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Local citizens will not be required to pay for vaccination against swine flu,
officially known as influenza A(H1N1), a health official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>"The free-of-charge policy is aimed at encouraging people to receive
inoculations as soon as possible once the vaccination program is launched next
month, " said Chou Chih-hau, deputy director-general of the Centers for Disease
Control under the Department of Health (DOH).</P>
      <P>According to Chou, the DOH will offer NT$150 (US$4.63) per head in subsidies to
local health care institutions that offer H1N1 vaccinations.</P>
      <P>"The amount is enough to pay for registration fees and medical examination fees
for each citizen who receives H1N1 inoculation at designated hospitals, clinics
or health centers," Chou said.</P>
      <P>As more than 10 million people will be involved in various kinds of vaccinations
in the coming months, Chou said, the subsidy program for H1N1 vaccination is
expected to help speed up completion of the program.</P>
      <P>According to the DOH's plan, 5 million doses of H1N1 vaccine imported from
Switzerland-based pharmaceutical firm Novartis will be available for high-risk
individuals in late October, while 10 million doses to be supplied by local
manufacturer Adimmune Corp. will be ready in early November.</P>
      <P>As the two suppliers will deliver the doses in staggered shipments, the vaccines
will be administered simultaneously.</P>
      <P>The DOH-initiated priority list for H1N1 vaccination is led by typhoon-affected
victims, medical personnel in charge of disease control and prevention, and
pregnant women.</P>
      <P>They will be followed on the priority list by pre-school children, seriously ill
patients, elementary, junior and senior high school students, individuals in the
19-24 age bracket and those over 25 at high risk of cardiopulmonary disease,
healthy people in the 25-49 age bracket, and those aged between 50 and 64.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) reported Sunday that five
more patients had been hospitalized for severe H1N1 symptoms in the previous 24
hours, bringing the total hospitalization cases to 319 since the outbreak began.</P>
      <P>Of that number, 21 had died, 28 were still being treated in local hospitals,
while the other 270 had been discharged after making complete recoveries.</P>
      <P>The five newly hospitalized patients include one male and four females, aged
between 4 and 42.</P>
      <P>A CECC official said the center is keeping a close watch on the developments in
the H1N1 situation in the wake of the Mid-Autumn Festival.</P>
      <P>"The weather has been cooling off significantly in recent days and human
interaction has increased over the Mid-Autumn Festival, so we are monitoring
whether the two developments will have any impact on the H1N1 situation," the
official said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tremor does not predispose Taiwan to landslides: expert</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An earthquake that jolted Taiwan early Sunday has not predisposed the island to
more landslides, even if Typhoon Parma hits the island in the next few days, an
expert said later that day.</P>
      <P>Yen Hong-yuan, a professor of earth science at Central University in Chungli,
Taoyuan County, said the precipitation brought by Parma to eastern Taiwan had
not yet exceeded safety limits and was therefore unlikely to trigger landslides.</P>
      <P>He said the 6.3-magnitude temblor 23 km southeast of Hualien at 1: 36 a.m. was
"not abnormal."</P>
      <P>"Although it is the second temblor with a magnitude over 6 this year, the number
of earthquakes this year is within the normal range," he said.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Yen said, the precipitation caused by Typhoon Parma so far was less
than one-third of the nearly 3,000 mm of rainfall brought by Typhoon Morakot and
there were few slopes in eastern Taiwan predisposed to mudslides.</P>
      <P>"The fear that soil softened up by the temblor is more likely to slide after
sucking up water from rainfall is groundless, " Yen pointed out.</P>
      <P>As Typhoon Morakot, which triggered widespread landslides and killed more than
600 people in early August, has rammed home the importance of evacuating people
from mudslide-prone areas before torrential rain, Yen said he was confident that
the Morakot tragedy will not be repeated.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Parma was centered 310 km south-southwest of Taiwan's southernmost tip
of Eluanpi as of Sunday afternoon, moving slowly on a north-northwesterly
trajectory, according to the Central Weather Bureau.</P>

    <HEADLINE>More than 1,200 evacuated as Typhoon Parma nears</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 4 (CNA)
10/04/09  19:14:55
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 1,200 residents in mudslide-prone areas of four counties around the
nation had been evacuated as of 1 p.m. Sunday amid the threat of Typhoon Parma,
which was forecast to hit Taiwan after slamming into the Philippines the
previous day.</P>
      <P>"As of 1 p.m. Sunday, 1,241 residents in 10 townships and villages in four
counties -- Nantou, Chiayi, Kaohsiung and Pingtung -- had been evacuated over
mudslide concerns, " the Central Emergency Operations Center said in a
statement.</P>
      <P>The evacuation was part of the government's efforts to avoid a repeat of the
tragedy caused by Typhoon Morakot in early August, when the storm triggered
massive flooding and devastating landslides in southern Taiwan that buried
various mountain villages and left more than 700 people dead or missing.</P>
      <P>According to the center, rainfall spawned by Typhoon Parma was concentrated in
the mountains of northeastern Taiwan's Yilan County and the northern county of
Taipei.</P>
      <P>From Saturday midnight through 1 p.m. Sunday, 129.5 mm of precipitation had been
recorded in Juifang, Taipei County, with 124.5 mm in Yilan's Tatung township and
112 m.m. in the county's Tungshan township, center officials said.</P>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) originally predicted that Parma could bring up
to 1,100 mm of rainfall to Taiwan's mountainous regions, but later lowered the
forecast to 800 mm, with the mountains of northern and eastern Taiwan receiving
the worst of it.</P>
      <P>The bureau issued a land warning for Typhoon Parma for the Hengchun peninsula in
southern Taiwan at 5:30 a.m. Sunday.</P>
      <P>Since then, however, the storm had been swirling around in the Bashi Channel
that separates Taiwan from the Philippines and its speed had slowed to 4 kph.</P>
      <P>The CWB's typhoon report had not mentioned Parma's speed since 8: 30 a.m. that
day, with all follow-up reports saying only that the typhoon  was in the Bashi
Channel  and moving  slowly  on a west-northwesterly trajectory.</P>
      <P>CWB meteorologists said it was difficult to predict whether Typhoon Parma would
move east or west because several factors -- a high pressure system in South
Asia, a cold front from the north, a high pressure system in the Pacific Ocean
and another typhoon, Melor -- could affect its movement.</P>
      <P>Noting that Typhoon Melor was moving fast from southeast of Taiwan in a west-
northwesterly direction, the weathermen said Melor was likely to come closer
than 1,500 km to Parma over the next two days.</P>
      <P>By then, they said, a drag effect will appear between the two typhoons, although
they added that it remained to be seen whether Melor would drag Parma northeast
or southwest.</P>
      <P>Lee Ching-sheng, a meteorology professor at National Taiwan University,  echoed
the  CWB  weathermen's  views  on Parma's unpredictability, saying many factors
could affect its course.</P>
      <P>Whatever course the typhoon takes, however, the government was determined to
make every possible effort to minimize the chances of disaster.</P>
      <P>It had been taking precautionary measures since Saturday, with President Ma
Ying-jeou, Premier Wu Den-yih and other Cabinet members inspecting disaster
prevention and response preparations in coastal and mountainous areas and the
military assisting in evacuating mountain villagers.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot caused heavy human casualties and property damage in Taiwan and
led to a major Cabinet reshuffle, with Wu replacing Liu Chao-shiuan as premier.
Political analysts said Typhoon Parma will test the new Cabinet's competence and
operational efficiency.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Emergency Operations Center, which was opened the previous day to
brace for approaching Typhoon Parma, set up a hotline for emergency calls
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah, who serves as commander of the center,
announced the six-line (02) 8196-6999 hotline to the press that same day.</P>
      <P>However, he said members of the public who require help should first dial the
regular 119 emergency call and use the center's hotline only when the 119 line
is engaged or disconnected.</P>
      <P>"We will relay the calls for help to the relevant local authorities, so calls
for help might not be dealt with as fast as if people call 119 directly," said
Jiang.</P>
      <P>In order to avoid jamming the emergency lines, the minister suggested that the
public report disasters to local borough or village chiefs, who will compile the
information and relay it all together to the emergency centers operated by local
governments.</P>
      <P>The extra hotline was set up after people were reduced to calling local TV
channels to report disasters during the onslaught of Typhoon Morakot in early
August, complaining that the 119 line was always busy.</P>
      <P>The image of President Ma Ying-jeou's  administration  was tarnished by these
complaints, which was part of the reason for a Cabinet reshuffle in which former
Premier Liu Chao-shiuan stepped down.</P>
      <P>As of Sunday afternoon, Typhoon Parma was located 310 km south-southwest of
Taiwan's southernmost tip of Eluanpi, moving slowly on a north-northwesterly
trajectory, according to the Central Weather Bureau.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 34,584 military servicemen around Taiwan and on several outlaying
islands were ready to respond to calls for rescue and relief operations during
the onslaught of Typhoon Parma, the Ministry of National Defense said Sunday.</P>
      <P>In a press release, the ministry said it believed the deployments would meet any
local government demand for help.</P>
      <P>The forces were divided into five groups, with each of them responsible for an
operational area under the command of an ad hoc Armed Forces Emergency
Operations Center.</P>
      <P>The center will keep abreast of the latest developments of the storm, and will
order the servicemen to take action without waiting for approval from their
superiors, according to the press release.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of the approach of the typhoon, the ministry said it had
canceled leave for some servicemen 36 hours before the Central Weather Bureau
issued a land warning for southern Taiwan Sunday morning.</P>
      <P>Noting that it has made rescue and relief operations one of its main priorities,
the ministry said it will engage in the disaster relief operation as actively as
it would in a battle situation.</P>
      <P>The Defense Ministry was criticised for its slow response to local government
calls for help in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot, which ravaged parts of the
south of the island in early August.</P>
      <P>The poor response meant that former Defense Minister Chen Chao-min had to step
down in an ensuing Cabinet reshuffle.</P>
      <P>The armed forces efforts earned praise from Premier Wu Den-yih that day when he
made an inspection tour of a military command in Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>The premier noted that the armed forces have a lot of personnel and fleets of
excavators on standby and are ready to deploy them to diaster-prone areas as
soon as possible.</P>
      <P>"It will be a perfect anti-disaster drill even if Typhoon Parma doesn't prompt
any disaster," he said.</P>
      <P>"With the readiness of the people and the armed forces, I am certain that
whatever havoc Typhoon Parma may wreak, it will not be as serious as that caused
by Typhoon Morakot," he added.</P>

      <P>Braving windy and rainy weather, a dazzling dog parade took place in Taipei
Sunday as part of celebrations to mark World Animal Day.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that the Oct. 4 World Animal Day had been celebrated in
Taiwan with such fanfare.</P>
      <P>Although the approach of Typhoon Parma brought wind and rain to Taipei,  many
animal  rights  activists  took  part  in  the one-kilometer-long parade that
ended in front of Taipei City Hall.</P>
      <P>Many of the marchers were dogs decked out in colorful raincoats, head scalves
and other decorations.</P>
      <P>With a theme of opposing the abandoning of pets, gin traps and animal abuse, the
parade was complemented by a trade fair, with about 60 booths selling pet foods
and pet-care products.</P>
      <P>Organizers said 20 percent of proceeds from the sales would be donated to animal
protection groups in southern Taiwan that were hard-hit by Typhoon Morakot in
early August.</P>
      <P>Many animal protection  and rescue groups as well as pet veterinaries and
clinics and stray dog centers also put up booths at the site to promote their
cause.</P>
      <P>As the event was organized by Animals Taiwan, a protection and rescue group
founded by British expatriates in Taiwan, many foreign residents took part in
the event to throw their support for animal rights protection.</P>
      <P>The World Animal Day was started in 1931 at a convention of ecologists in
Florence, Italy as a way of highlighting the plight of endangered species.</P>
      <P>It was also the feast day of Saint Francis of Assisi, a Catholic deacon and the
founder of the Order of Friars Minor, more commonly known as the Franciscans. He
is known as the patron saint of animals and the environment, and it is customary
for Catholic churches to hold ceremonies honoring animals around his feast day

      <P>No elections will be held in Taipei County, Kaohsiung County, Taichung County,

that he understands the nature of man."</TEXT>

      <P>The land warning in southern Taiwan against Typhoon Parma could be lifted later
Monday as the system has weakened and was downgraded to a tropical storm earlier
in the day, the Central Weather Bureau said.</P>
      <P>Parma has weakened significantly since it swept through the Philippines late
last week and it continued to lose strength over the weekend, with maximum winds
near the center dropping to 101 kilometers per hour, according to weather
forecasters.</P>
      <P>The CWB said that as Parma is also getting smaller in terms of the radius of its
typhoon-force winds, the land warning issued for Taiwan's southernmost Hengchun
Peninsular could be lifted soon.</P>
      <P>As of noon Monday, Parma was located at 250 kilometers southwest of Eluanbi on
Taiwan's southern tip, the CWB said.</P>
      <P>Forecasters warned that Parma is expected to linger southwest of Taiwan for one
or two days, and that its outer bands, coupled with the prevailing northeasterly
monsoon in the region, could continue to bring heavy rains in eastern and
northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>People in mountainous areas should guard against landslides and falling rocks
that could be triggered by heavy rains, while those in low-lying areas should be
on the alert against floods, the CWB said.</P>
      <P>Although Parma has not made landfall on Taiwan, the island has experienced heavy
rains in the last two days. Sansing in Yilan, eastern Taiwan has borne the
brunt, having been drenched with 700 mm of rain in the last 36 hours.</P>
      <P>Governments at various levels in Taiwan have been put on high alert as the
island has not yet fully recovered from the disaster caused by Typhoon Morakot
on Aug. 8.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot, which brought precipitation of nearly 3,000 mm in a couple of
days, wreaked havoc on southern Taiwan, taking 600 lives.</P>

      <P>The government is planning to set up a Cabinet-level disaster prevention and
relief administration  to integrate and streamline its disaster relief
mechanism, the Minister of the Interior Jiang Yi-huah said Monday.</P>
      <P>The administration will focus on improving disaster response and speeding up
recovery in disaster areas, Jiang told the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Regarding the government's reconstruction work in the wake of Typhoon Morakot's
destruction in August, Jiang said the Cabinet will launch four programs under
the broad headings of regional planning, infrastructure  repair,  home
rehabilitation,  and  industrial reconstruction.</P>
      <P>The regional planning program will include soil conservation and watershed
management, while the infrastructure aspect will cover the repair and rebuilding
of roads, bridges and tunnels, he said. Under the home rehabilitation program,
people will receive assistance to rebuild their homes, and the industrial
reconstruction program will provide relief loans and other forms of assistance
to industries, he added.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the disbursement of relief funds since the Typhoon Morakot disaster,
Jiang said that as of Oct. 1, some 99.84 percent of the subsidies for death,
injury or missing relatives had been distributed, while 85.94 percent of the
funds for housing damage and 89.8 percent of that for flood damage had been
disbursed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Over 6,600 evacuated as Typhoon Parma approaches</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 6,600 residents in mudslide-prone areas of six counties around the
country had been evacuated as of 8 a.m. Monday as Typhoon Parma lingered
southwest of Taiwan, the Central Emergency Operations Center said Monday.</P>
      <P>In order to protect people's lives and safety, the government will issue
compulsory evacuation orders in danger zones, and will not accept written
statements of self-responsibility from residents who choose not to move, said
Premier Wu Den-yih while responding to media questions at the Legislative Yuan
Monday.</P>
      <P>A local newspaper reported Monday that some villagers in Pingtung County wanted
to sign written statements that they had chosen not to leave and would be
responsible for their own safety. But the local authorities refused their
requests and forced them to evacuate the area, according to the report.</P>
      <P>The evacuation order was part of the government's efforts to avoid a repeat of
the tragedy caused by Typhoon Morakot in early August when the storm triggered
massive flooding and devastating landslides in southern Taiwan, burying mountain
villages and leaving more than 700 people dead or missing.</P>
      <P>According to the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) , rainfall from Typhoon Parma was
concentrated in the mountains of northeastern Taiwan's Yilan County. As of
midday Monday, six areas in Yilan County had recorded the highest levels of
precipitation in the country.</P>
      <P>The county's Tungshan's township was drenched with 114 mm of rain in one hour,
from 11 a.m. to noon Monday, the CWB said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Council of Agriculture (COA) on Monday updated the number of
rivers on its red alert list for mudflows. The 28 rivers on the list are all
located in 14 villages and townships in Yilan county.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some of the donations from China for relief aid in the aftermath of Typhoon
Morakot will probably be used in the reconstruction of the Shuangyuan Bridge,
which was destroyed by massive flooding triggered by the typhoon, Premier Wu
Den-yih said Monday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks at the Legislative Yuan in response to questions  by
lawmakers after reporting  on a planned special government budget for post-
typhoon reconstruction.</P>
      <P>Legislator Pan Meng-an of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party questioned
the premier about China's promise of NT$5.1 billion (US$158.14 million)  to
support relief aid and restoration in Morakot-affected areas of southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Pan had questioned the actual amount that had been received, pointing out that
there had been discrepancies as to how much had in fact arrived.</P>
      <P>Wu told the lawmaker that the government has so far received only some NT$900
million of China's promised donation and that it hopes the rest of the funds can
be allocated to major post-Morakot reconstruction projects.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, along with other relevant
authorities, is studying a plan to spend the Chinese funds on the reconstruction
of the Shuangyuan Bridge over the Gaoping River, which connected Kaohsiung
County's Linyuan township and Sinyuan township of Pingtung County until it
collapsed Aug. 9, Wu said.</P>
      <P>It has been assessed that the reconstruction will cost over NT$3 billion,
including the cost of building a temporary bridge until the 2.8-km bridge is
rebuilt, according to the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The bridge reconstruction project is scheduled to begin February 2010 and to be
completed by December 2012.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Women's labor force participation rate on rise: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.5   (CAN)
10/05/09  16:28:18
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The domestic  women's  labor  force participation rate has been rising steadily
in recent years and is expected to exceed 50 percent for the first time next
year, the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Monday.</P>
      <P>As the number of jobs in the labor market has not increased substantially,  CEPD
officials  said,  rising  women's  labor participation rate could squeeze men's
employment opportunities, with men aged over 40 being most vulnerable.</P>
      <P>The labor force participation  rate is the percentage  of working-age persons --
those aged 16-64 -- in an economy who are employed or are unemployed but looking
for a job.</P>
      <P>According to CEPD statistics, men's labor participation rate has shown a
downward trend in the past seven years, falling from 68.22 percent in 2002 to 67
percent in 2008.</P>
      <P>In contrast, women's labor participation rate has been on the upswing. In the
past, the rate tended to hover around 46 percent as many local women could not
seek work outside the home because of household and child rearing
responsibilities.</P>
      <P>However, the situation has changed since 2002 when the women's labor
participation rate began its uninterrupted upward streak, rising from 46.59
percent that year to 49.67 percent in 2008.</P>
      <P>Globally, women generally lag behind men in terms of labor force participation,
CEPD officials said.</P>
      <P>However, except for Taiwan, women's labor participation rates in most advanced
economies tend to be over 50 percent. In the United States and many European
countries, the rate is higher than 70 percent. In 2008, Japan's women's labor
participation rate reached 67 percent and South Korea's 59 percent,</P>
      <P>According to the officials, marriage has been one of the most important factors
affecting local women's labor participation.</P>
      <P>CEPD statistics show that labor participation rates are almost the same among
unmarried males and females, approaching 60 percent in both categories. But the
rate tends to fall below 50 percent for married women, the figures show.</P>
      <P>In 2008, single women's labor participation rate was 9 percentage points higher
than that of married women, according to CEPD tallies.</P>
      <P>But over the past seven years, the married women's labor participation rate has
risen by more than 3 percent due to a combination of factors, CEPD officials
said.</P>
      <P>One of the factors might be related to the fact that married women have been
forced to enter the job market because their husbands are earning less than
before.</P>
      <P>Another factor might be the influx of single young women into the job market,
the official said, adding that higher levels of education among women has made
it easier for them to land jobs.</P>

      <P>Kenzaburo Oe, the renowned Japanese writer who won the 1994 Nobel Prize for
Literature for creating "an imagined world where life and myth condense to form
a disconcerting picture of the human predicament today, " arrived in Taiwan
Monday for his first-ever visit to the country.</P>
      <P>Oe is visiting Taiwan at the invitation of the Institute of Chinese Literature
and Philosophy (ICLP) under Academia Sinica -- Taiwan's most prestigious
academic institution.</P>
      <P>In addition to attending a symposium on his literature scheduled for Oct. 6-7,
Oe will also give lectures and autograph copies of his books for local readers.</P>
      <P>Oe, 74, has been described as "Japan's social conscience" for his resolute
opposition to Japanese militarism and the deep sense of critical self-
examination that pervades his work.</P>
      <P>"Oe has condemned Japan's invasion of other Asian countries for many years now,
and regards his trip to Taiwan as a journey of atonement for Japan's past
atrocities, " said Peng Hsiao-yen, an ICLP research fellow.</P>
      <P>According to Peng, Oe has visited China seven times, where he has been heartily
received. During one of his visits there, he conveyed his wish to visit Taiwan
to Xu Jinlong, a research fellow at the Beijing-based Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences.</P>
      <P>"This eventually led the ICLP and the Chinese academy to cooperate in organizing
the Oct. 6-7 symposium in Taipei that will review Oe's literature from an
international perspective," Peng said, adding that Oe's visit also represents
his wish for a cross-Taiwan Strait academic exchange focusing on his work.</P>
      <P>The symposium will open with a speech by Oe, to be titled "Late Work, " an
allusion to the work by late Palestinian American cultural giant Edward Said,
one of his literary bosom friends, Peng said, adding that in the speech, Oe will
relate what he hopes to do for Asian society in the remainder of his life.</P>
      <P>A total of 13 papers will be presented at the seminar, with topics ranging from
Oe's literary imagination, the influence of Chinese writer Lu Xun on his work,
the position of music in his work and his leftist ideas, according to Peng.</P>
      <P>The ICLP will also organize an exhibition of Oe's literature, dubbed "From
Shikoku Forest to the World, " which will be accompanied by musical works
produced by his brain-damaged son and literary muse, Hikari.</P>
      <P>The Oct. 6-9 exhibition will display Oe's literary works, manuscripts and 40
photos featuring his acceptance of the Nobel Prize and other relevant
activities, as well as paintings by his wife.</P>
      <P>Oe was born in a forest-hemmed village in Ehirne Prefecture on the island of
Shikoku. In his Nobel Prize acceptance speech, he described himself as "a son of
forests, " as forests have been a limitless source of his literary inspiration.</P>
      <P>During his childhood,  Oe lived through World War II, an experience that left a
deep life-long imprint on his writings. The ferocity of war, post-war trauma and
the melancholia of death infuse his early works, which are heavily influenced by
Western modernism, according to Peng.</P>
      <P>"As an author, Oe has been engaged in various social and political  issues from
an anti-war,  humanitarian  and liberal perspective," she added.</P>

      <P>However, we are worried that the country's politicians from President Ma on down
are putting on a show to get public praise rather than to avoid the disaster.</P>
      <P>Our concerns were stoked by Premier Wu Den-yih's claims that his administration
would prefer to let the public take an unnecessary day off for the typhoon
rather than risk their lives to go to work.</P>
      <P>Whether the day should be taken off during a typhoon is a question which can be
easily determined according to the weather conditions, and an unnecessary
holiday might cost the country NT$2 billion worth of production.</P>

      <P>KMT's problem is not factionism, but the nature of factions.</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) lost lawmaker by-elections in Miaoli and Yulin
counties in tandem, and was defeated in a referendum on whether to allow
gambling in Penghu County.</P>
      <P>Political pundits have blamed factionism within the party for its defeats and
they seem to be right, as local factions in many other counties are threatening
the party's chances for success in their areas in the year-end elections of
local government chiefs.</P>
      <P>But factionism is not endemic to the KMT, as the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) is also rife with factions. But unlike the DPP factions,
the KMT factions are more interested in snapping up benefits than pursuing the
party's goals.</P>
      <P>In order to win elections with local faction support, the party authorities have
to distribute benefits evenly among them.</P>
      <P>The party lost its control of these factions when it could not meet their greed
for benefits.</P>
      <P>This problem may not be solved in the near future, but the KMT will not be able
to thrive if it does not address the issue.</P>

      <P>Chinese parade is not what we should be worried about, censorship</P>
      <P>is</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Democratic Progressive Party criticized several local TV
channels for broadcasting the whole process of China's National Day military
parade in Beijing, claiming that it hurt local people's feelings, national
security and constitutes a violation of the law.</P>
      <P>The Government Information Office promised to look into this and to mete out
punishment if any run-ins with the law were found.</P>
      <P>We have to congratulate the DPP for its eventual learning of censorship from its
arch rival Chiang Kai-shek and its eventual forsaking of its founders' cause of
pushing for press freedom.</P>
      <P>Chiang would laugh in his tomb for having the DPP as his followers.</P>
      <P>However, we have to urge the Government Information Office, and President Ma
Ying-jeou's administration to pause and think. Is this a political taboo that a
government which claims to be a follower of liberalism dare to break?</P>
      <P>Don't dismiss the punishment to be meted out by the Government Information
Office as a little wrong step, it will become the beginning of a huge setback
for the country's freedom and democracy.</P>
      <P>The opposition is willing to betray its cause and to debase itself, but the
ruling party should resist the temptation of abusing power and ignore the sirens
of nationalism. It should not forsake the country's hard-earned press freedom
and plunge the nation into the abyss of dictatorship.</P>
      <P>China's military parade is a public event before the eyes of people around the
world. Anyone who is interested in it may watch it via the Internet.</P>
      <P>By the same token, any local TV channel which considers it news-worth may
broadcast it.</P>
      <P>We are not alarmed by TV broadcasts of China's military parade, but we will be
alarmed if the government punishes these channels because it means the revival
of censorship. Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>Government's incompetence will result in problems for the elderly</P>
      <P>The government's latest statistics show that the average life expectancy in
Taiwan is 76 for men and 82 for women.</P>
      <P>Those figures mean that there will be an average of 6.4 years for every man and
8.2 years for every woman when they will need caretakers.</P>
      <P>The cost of taking care of the elderly will be a heavy financial burden both on
their family members and society as a whole.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, we have not seen any attempts on the part of current government
to come to grips with this looming problem.</P>

      <P>The captain and two crew members of a Panama-registered cargo ship that sank off
Taiwan's outlying Penghu Island group were rescued one day later by marine
search and rescue personnel from Taiwan and China, but 11 other crew members
remained missing, the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau said Monday.</P>
      <P>The 1,375-ton Silver Sea sank some 86 nautical miles southwest of Penghu
archipelago Sunday afternoon, while transporting 53 containers from Taiwan to
the Philippines.</P>
      <P>It departed the Kaohsiung port for Manila around noon Saturday.</P>
      <P>The bureau said it received calls for help from the ship at 5: 25 p.m. Sunday
and immediately asked the search command center under the Executive Yuan to
launch rescue operations on the sea and from the air.</P>
      <P>The center swiftly dispatched military rescue helicopters to the area, while
rescue helicopters and two patrol boats were also sent by the Ministry of the
Interior and the Coast Guard Administration to the scene, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>The ship's captain, who is from Myanmar, was rescued by a Chinese ship around 9
a.m. Monday, while two crew members from Indonesia were saved by Taiwan's
vessels and were sent to a hospital in Chiayi County later Monday.</P>
      <P>The Chinese vessel went to the scene after learning of the accident. Taiwan also
sent rescue ships to the area where the ship sank, which is close to the
imaginary middle line separating Taiwan and China in the Taiwan Strait. A Hong
Kong cargo ship also sailed to the spot to help with rescues.</P>
      <P>As of 5: 00 p. m. Monday, the remaining 11 crew members were still missing.</P>
      <P>Although several rescue helicopters were sent to search for the victims, pilots
only saw some containers, the wreckage of the ship and an empty life-saving boat
floating on the sea, the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Tsoying marine base in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung City, has sent
several ships to the area to continue searching for survivors, the center noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Senior citizens aged 75 and over were advised Monday to get vaccinated against
seasonal influenza and streptococcus pneumonia -- a frequent killer of the
elderly -- with the approach of the flu season.</P>
      <P>Lin Hung-chuan, a specialist in lung disease and diseases of the immune system
at Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH) issued the advice after a national
inoculation program against seasonal flu began Oct. 1.</P>
      <P>The elderly are also entitled to free pneumonia inoculations, offered by the
Wang Chan-yang social welfare and charity foundation run by the Formosa Plastics
Group, which owns CGMH.</P>
      <P>Lin said both the flu and the streptococcus vaccines are safe to take together.</P>
      <P>Lin said that while seasonal flu is not particularly dangerous in itself, it can
cause complications such as pneumonia, which can be fatal.</P>
      <P>Streptococcus pneumonia is the most frequently seen pneumonia killer, Lin
continued, pointing out that the fatality rate among the elderly infected by the
virulent bacteria is 42.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the chance of being attacked by the bacteria again is five times
higher than that of contracting the disease for the first time, he said.</P>
      <P>It was streptococcus pneumonia that prompted the late founder of the Formosa
Plastics Group, Wang Yung-ching, to donate 578,000 doses of streptococcus
pneumonia vaccine in 2007 for people over 75 after he caught the disease but
recovered, according to Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Deputy Director-
General Chou Chih-hao.</P>
      <P>The free vaccination was designed to be carried out over three years starting
from 2007, and there are still about 40,000 doses left for this year, Chou said,
revealing that Wang's foundation has also donated another 57,000 doses to
increase the stock for this year.</P>
      <P>According to CDC statistics, Taiwan has a population of 1.01 million people aged
75 and over, 470,000 of whom have not yet been inoculated with the pneumonia
vaccine, which offers protection for five years.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) reported that day that one
more patient, aged 12, had been hospitalized with severe influenza A(H1N1)
symptoms in the previous 24 hours, bringing the total hospitalization cases to
320 since the outbreak began.</P>
      <P>Of that number, 21 had died, 28 were still being treated in local hospitals,
while the other 270 had been discharged after making complete recoveries.</P>

      <P>Taiwan was holding US$332.24 billion in foreign exchange reserves as of the end

figure, the Central Bank of the Republic of China reported Monday.</P>
      <P>Lin Sun-yuan, director-general of the bank's Department of Foreign Exchange,
attributed the increase to earnings from foreign exchange reserve investments,

      <P>Taiwan was still ranked as the world's fourth-largest holder of forex reserves,
after China, Japan and Russia and ahead of India, in September.</P>
      <P>China held US$2.13 trillion in forex reserves as of the end of June, increasing
some US$177.9 billion over that posted in March, Lin said. Japan had US$995.7
billion as of the end of August, up US$3.8 billion over that posted in July.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Rebuilding of major southern bridge not to rely on Chinese funds</HEADLINE>

10/05/09  21:22:43
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih ruled out the possibility Monday of using China-donated funds
to rebuild a major bridge in southern Taiwan that was destroyed during the
onslaught of Typhoon Morakot in early August.</P>
      <P>"We have politely rejected the proposal  of using Chinese donations to finance
reconstruction of the Shuangyuan Bridge over the Gaoping River, " Wu said at a
Legislative Yuan committee meeting Monday afternoon.</P>
      <P>He was responding to a question from opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) Legislator Huang Wei-cher on how China's pledge of NT$5.1 billion in funds
for post-typhoon rehabilitation will be used.</P>
      <P>Wu said the government has so far received only about NT$900 million (US$27.86
million) of the amount promised by Beijing.</P>
      <P>"China intends to have the remaining funds used to finance selected
infrastructure reconstruction projects, with the names of Chinese donors
engraved on them," Wu said.</P>
      <P>After China's Sichuan province was rattled by a devastating earthquake in May
2008, Taiwanese companies donated funds for the reconstruction of certain major
infrastructure projects, and China wants to follow that example, Wu said.</P>
      <P>In response to a question from DPP Legislator Pan Men-an, Wu had suggested in
the morning session of the committee hearing that funds from China might be used
to finance reconstruction of the Shuangyuan Bridge, which connected Kaohsiung
County's Linyuan township and Pingtung County's Sinyuan township until it
collapsed Aug. 9.</P>
      <P>In the afternoon session, however, Wu ruled out that possibility.</P>
      <P>"After a careful assessment, we think it is inappropriate to have the bridge
financed with Chinese funds, " Wu said, without further explanation.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan will consider allocating Chinese donations to other projects
and will exercise prudence in selecting the most suitable ones, Wu added.</P>
      <P>The Shuangyuan Bridge reconstruction  project will cost an estimated NT$3
billion, including the cost of building a temporary bridge until the 2.8 km
bridge is rebuilt, according to an Executive Yuan assessment.</P>
      <P>The project is scheduled to begin in February 2010 and be completed by December
2012.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will decide by the end of the year whether local flat panel and
chip manufacturers can invest in facilities or buy stakes in other companies in
China, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>"Relevant government agencies will conduct a cross-ministerial meeting on the
issue later this year to set a clear course for the future development of the
two local sectors," MOEA officials said.</P>
      <P>Apart from the key condition that it must be beneficial to Taiwan's people, a
clear policy that helps the two local industries get a foothold in China's
market without leading to the hollowing out of Taiwan will be adopted by the end
of this year, they said.</P>
      <P>Economics Minister Shih Yen-shiang said at the end of September that companies
in the two sectors would be allowed to invest in China to help them secure
China's market and prevent it from looking toward partners from other countries
such as South Korea to acquire related technologies.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwanese chipmakers are limited to investing in plants in China
that use the older 8-inch wafer technology.</P>
      <P>A local newspaper reported on Monday that workers at some flat panel and chip
companies headquartered in the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park are worried
about losing their jobs if their employers were allowed to invest in advanced
technology processes in China.</P>
      <P>In response to the report, the Industrial Development Bureau made it clear
Monday that the policy will fully heed public concern that such relations with
China must not affect the interests of Taiwan's people.</P>
      <P>Even if high-tech companies are permitted to invest in China on a case-by-case
basis,  government  policy  will still take into consideration the Wassenaar
Agreement to mitigate adverse effects on Taiwanese enterprises, bureau officials
said.</P>
      <P>The agreement is signed by some 40 countries to prevent exports of sensitive
technology with potential military uses to certain countries, including China,

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's statistical agency unveiled cost-of-living indexes for the
first time Monday in line with Premier Wu Den-yih's pledge to make economic
indicators more relevant to the everyday lives of ordinary people.</P>
      <P>The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) prepared
three cost-of-living indexes to more precisely reflect the fluctuation of prices
for goods and services in three categories.</P>
      <P>The first cost-of-living index was figured out mainly based on the costs of
food, fuel and electricity while the second index covers a basket of 244 items,
including food, education and entertainment, such as travel, extra schooling
fees and electronic products and computers.</P>
      <P>The third index covers 239 items, including food and other daily necessities,
such as clothing, toilet paper and shampoo.</P>
      <P>According to the DGBAS tallies, September's first cost-of-living index stood at
113.97, down 1.23 percent from the month-earlier level.</P>
      <P>The second cost-of-living index stood at 109.26 in September, falling 1.14
percent from the August level,  while the third cost-of-living index stood at
110.36, down 1.11 percent from August.</P>
      <P>"Compared with the traditional consumer price index (CPI) , all three cost-of-
living indexes registered bigger falls than the CPI, " said Wu Chao-ming, a
DGBAS section chief in charge of calculating and monitoring consumer price
fluctuations.</P>
      <P>The CPI stood at 105.49 in September, down only 0.65 percent from August, Wu
said.</P>
      <P>The larger drops in the three cost-of-living indexes mainly resulted from
substantial declines in vegetable, egg and electricity prices during the period,
down 12.54 percent, 5.64 percent and 11.62 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>"These three items account for a larger weight in the first cost-of-living index
than in the CPI, thus resulting in a larger decline in the cost-of-living
index," Wu explained.</P>
      <P>In preparing the CPI index, Wu said, the agency covers 424 items.</P>
      <P>"With a view to make the index better reflect the average person's feelings and
their everyday lives, the first cost-of-living index selected only 190 items
from those gauged in the CPI, with food prices accounting for 80 percent of the
index," Wu elaborated.</P>
      <P>The first index also includes the costs of natural gas and electricity as well
as fuel costs, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The second cost-of-living index covers 244 items -- the 190 items calculated in
the first index plus 54 others in the education and entertainment categories.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu said the consumer price index dropped 0.86 percent in September
from the year-earlier level. It marked the eighth consecutive monthly decline
since Feburary.</P>
      <P>The price decline was slightly larger than August's 0.8 percent, but Wu said the
figure did not signal any risk of further economic contraction as the economic
recession has gradually bottomed out.</P>

      <P>The government intends to lure more investment from Taiwanese firms based in
China by touting six new star industries, a Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yu Chi-cheng, deputy director of the MOEA's Department of Industrial Services,
touted the benefits of investing in Taiwan at a gathering of China-based
Taiwanese businessmen in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung City to celebrate the Mid-
Autumn Festival.</P>
      <P>Yu was trying to solicit investment in six star industries that Taiwan's
government has pushed aggressively as future growth engines -- specialty
agriculture, green energy, health care,  tourism, cultural innovation and
biotechnology,</P>
      <P>Among the 200 attendees were Kao Koong-lian, vice chairman and secretary-general
of the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)  and over 100
representatives of Taiwanese businessmen's associations in China.</P>
      <P>At the gathering, Yu also noted that total investment in Taiwan by local
businessmen operating in China had already beat the target set by the MOEA for
2009.</P>
      <P>The amount of capital injected by overseas Taiwan businessmen into the domestic
market between September 2006 and September this year totaled NT$71.7 billion
(US$2.26 billion), with NT$67.4 billion in 245 projects invested by those with
operations in China, Yu said.</P>
      <P>The balance of the investment was made by Taiwanese businessmen in the United
States, Canada and Southeast Asian countries.</P>
      <P>China-based  Taiwanese  businessmen  launched 110 investment projects in Taiwan
worth a total of NT$18.6 billion in 2008, and another 79 projects worth NT$35

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih demanded Monday that government agencies act swiftly against
so-called fat cat CEOs in affiliated organizations or foundations, especially
those who are earning two monthly salaries.</P>
      <P>Wu was responding  to questions  during a hearing at the Legislative Yuan,
during which ruling Kuomintang lawmaker Lin Teh-fu said these overpaid
executives had triggered negative sentiment among the public.</P>
      <P>"Some retired government officials now hired in government-run spin-offs or
nonprofit organizations not only are earning two salaries every month -- one
from their previous post in the government and one from their current job -- but
also enjoy a high interest rate of 18 percent on their bank deposits," Lin said.</P>
      <P>"That has provoked strong criticism from society."</P>
      <P>Wu promised  to fully  weed  out all such  personnel  in government-affiliated
enterprises and organizations based on relevant laws and regulations. "But we
cannot recklessly attack people, because there will be trouble if we're wrong,"
he stressed.</P>
      <P>It was reported that the Ministry of Economics Affairs has the largest number of
such enterprises or nonprofit organizations under its jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>Some of the top executives in these businesses get two salaries totaling over
NT$300,000 (US$9,300) per month -- more than a government minister makes, the
report said.</P>
      <P>Liu Ming-chung, director of the MOEA's Commission of National Corporations,
dismissed the report, however, and said that monthly salaries  for  ranking
CEOs  and  full-time  advisers  at 15 MOEA-affiliated businesses are set at
NT$80,000 or lower, in line with regulations which were already revised in July.</P>
      <P>"All of them get only one salary from their present posts, and no one continues
receiving another salary from their previous posts in the government," he
explained.</P>
      <P>"All newly employed CEOs and advisers will be compensated in compliance with the
new regulations."</P>
      <P>According  to Liu,  the MOEA runs 35 such companies  and organizations such as
Taiwan Power Company, Aerospace Industrial Development Corp and Chinese
Petroleum Corp. (Taiwan).</P>
      <P>The ministry currently hires 89 part-time and full-time advisers at these
businesses.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is planning to set up a Cabinet-level disaster prevention and
relief administration  to integrate and streamline its disaster relief
mechanism, the Minister of the Interior Jiang Yi-huah said Monday.</P>
      <P>The administration will focus on improving disaster response and speeding up
recovery in disaster areas, Jiang told the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Regarding the government's reconstruction work in the wake of Typhoon Morakot's
destruction in August, Jiang said the Cabinet will launch four programs under
the broad headings of regional planning, infrastructure  repair,  home
rehabilitation,  and  industrial reconstruction.</P>
      <P>The regional planning program will include soil conservation and watershed
management, while the infrastructure aspect will cover the repair and rebuilding
of roads, bridges and tunnels, he said. Under the home rehabilitation program,
people will receive assistance to rebuild their homes, and the industrial
reconstruction program will provide relief loans and other forms of assistance
to industries, he added.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the disbursement of relief funds since the Typhoon Morakot disaster,
Jiang said that as of Oct. 1, some 99.84 percent of the subsidies for death,
injury or missing relatives had been distributed, while 85.94 percent of the
funds for housing damage and 89.8 percent of that for flood damage had been
disbursed.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 6,600 residents in mudslide-prone areas of six counties around the
country had been evacuated as of 8 a.m. Monday as Typhoon Parma lingered
southwest of Taiwan, the Central Emergency Operations Center said Monday.</P>
      <P>In order to protect people's lives and safety, the government will issue
compulsory evacuation orders in danger zones, and will not accept written
statements of self-responsibility from residents who choose not to move, said
Premier Wu Den-yih while responding to media questions at the Legislative Yuan
Monday.</P>
      <P>A local newspaper reported Monday that some villagers in Pingtung County wanted
to sign written statements that they had chosen not to leave and would be
responsible for their own safety. But the local authorities refused their
requests and forced them to evacuate the area, according to the report.</P>
      <P>The evacuation order was part of the government's efforts to avoid a repeat of
the tragedy caused by Typhoon Morakot in early August when the storm triggered
massive flooding and devastating landslides in southern Taiwan, burying mountain
villages and leaving more than 700 people dead or missing.</P>
      <P>According to the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) , rainfall from Typhoon Parma was
concentrated in the mountains of northeastern Taiwan's Yilan County. As of
midday Monday, six areas in Yilan County had recorded the highest levels of
precipitation in the country.</P>
      <P>The county's Tungshan's township was drenched with 114 mm of rain in one hour,
from 11 a.m. to noon Monday, the CWB said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Council of Agriculture (COA) on Monday updated the number of
rivers on its red alert list for mudflows. The 28 rivers on the list are all
located in 14 villages and townships in Yilan county.</P>

      <P>Some of the donations from China for relief aid in the aftermath of Typhoon
Morakot will probably be used in the reconstruction of the Shuangyuan Bridge,
which was destroyed by massive flooding triggered by the typhoon, Premier Wu
Den-yih said Monday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks at the Legislative Yuan in response to questions  by
lawmakers after reporting  on a planned special government budget for post-
typhoon reconstruction.</P>
      <P>Legislator Pan Meng-an of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party questioned
the premier about China's promise of NT$5.1 billion (US$158.14 million)  to
support relief aid and restoration in Morakot-affected areas of southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Pan had questioned the actual amount that had been received, pointing out that
there had been discrepancies as to how much had in fact arrived.</P>
      <P>Wu told the lawmaker that the government has so far received only some NT$900
million of China's promised donation and that it hopes the rest of the funds can
be allocated to major post-Morakot reconstruction projects.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, along with other relevant
authorities, is studying a plan to spend the Chinese funds on the reconstruction
of the Shuangyuan Bridge over the Gaoping River, which connected Kaohsiung
County's Linyuan township and Sinyuan township of Pingtung County until it
collapsed Aug. 9, Wu said.</P>
      <P>It has been assessed that the reconstruction will cost over NT$3 billion,
including the cost of building a temporary bridge until the 2.8-km bridge is
rebuilt, according to the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The bridge reconstruction project is scheduled to begin February 2010 and to be
completed by December 2012.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Women's labor force participation rate on rise: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.5   (CAN)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The domestic  women's  labor  force participation rate has been rising steadily
in recent years and is expected to exceed 50 percent for the first time next
year, the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Monday.</P>
      <P>As the number of jobs in the labor market has not increased substantially,  CEPD
officials  said,  rising  women's  labor participation rate could squeeze men's
employment opportunities, with men aged over 40 being most vulnerable.</P>
      <P>The labor force participation  rate is the percentage  of working-age persons --
those aged 16-64 -- in an economy who are employed or are unemployed but looking
for a job.</P>
      <P>According to CEPD statistics, men's labor participation rate has shown a
downward trend in the past seven years, falling from 68.22 percent in 2002 to 67
percent in 2008.</P>
      <P>In contrast, women's labor participation rate has been on the upswing. In the
past, the rate tended to hover around 46 percent as many local women could not
seek work outside the home because of household and child rearing
responsibilities.</P>
      <P>However, the situation has changed since 2002 when the women's labor
participation rate began its uninterrupted upward streak, rising from 46.59
percent that year to 49.67 percent in 2008.</P>
      <P>Globally, women generally lag behind men in terms of labor force participation,
CEPD officials said.</P>
      <P>However, except for Taiwan, women's labor participation rates in most advanced
economies tend to be over 50 percent. In the United States and many European
countries, the rate is higher than 70 percent. In 2008, Japan's women's labor
participation rate reached 67 percent and South Korea's 59 percent,</P>
      <P>According to the officials, marriage has been one of the most important factors
affecting local women's labor participation.</P>
      <P>CEPD statistics show that labor participation rates are almost the same among
unmarried males and females, approaching 60 percent in both categories. But the
rate tends to fall below 50 percent for married women, the figures show.</P>
      <P>In 2008, single women's labor participation rate was 9 percentage points higher
than that of married women, according to CEPD tallies.</P>
      <P>But over the past seven years, the married women's labor participation rate has
risen by more than 3 percent due to a combination of factors, CEPD officials
said.</P>
      <P>One of the factors might be related to the fact that married women have been
forced to enter the job market because their husbands are earning less than
before.</P>
      <P>Another factor might be the influx of single young women into the job market,
the official said, adding that higher levels of education among women has made
it easier for them to land jobs.</P>

      <P>Kenzaburo Oe, the renowned Japanese writer who won the 1994 Nobel Prize for
Literature for creating "an imagined world where life and myth condense to form
a disconcerting picture of the human predicament today, " arrived in Taiwan
Monday for his first-ever visit to the country.</P>
      <P>Oe is visiting Taiwan at the invitation of the Institute of Chinese Literature
and Philosophy (ICLP) under Academia Sinica -- Taiwan's most prestigious
academic institution.</P>
      <P>In addition to attending a symposium on his literature scheduled for Oct. 6-7,
Oe will also give lectures and autograph copies of his books for local readers.</P>
      <P>Oe, 74, has been described as "Japan's social conscience" for his resolute
opposition to Japanese militarism and the deep sense of critical self-
examination that pervades his work.</P>
      <P>"Oe has condemned Japan's invasion of other Asian countries for many years now,
and regards his trip to Taiwan as a journey of atonement for Japan's past
atrocities, " said Peng Hsiao-yen, an ICLP research fellow.</P>
      <P>According to Peng, Oe has visited China seven times, where he has been heartily
received. During one of his visits there, he conveyed his wish to visit Taiwan
to Xu Jinlong, a research fellow at the Beijing-based Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences.</P>
      <P>"This eventually led the ICLP and the Chinese academy to cooperate in organizing
the Oct. 6-7 symposium in Taipei that will review Oe's literature from an
international perspective," Peng said, adding that Oe's visit also represents
his wish for a cross-Taiwan Strait academic exchange focusing on his work.</P>
      <P>The symposium will open with a speech by Oe, to be titled "Late Work, " an
allusion to the work by late Palestinian American cultural giant Edward Said,
one of his literary bosom friends, Peng said, adding that in the speech, Oe will
relate what he hopes to do for Asian society in the remainder of his life.</P>
      <P>A total of 13 papers will be presented at the seminar, with topics ranging from
Oe's literary imagination, the influence of Chinese writer Lu Xun on his work,
the position of music in his work and his leftist ideas, according to Peng.</P>
      <P>The ICLP will also organize an exhibition of Oe's literature, dubbed "From
Shikoku Forest to the World, " which will be accompanied by musical works
produced by his brain-damaged son and literary muse, Hikari.</P>
      <P>The Oct. 6-9 exhibition will display Oe's literary works, manuscripts and 40
photos featuring his acceptance of the Nobel Prize and other relevant
activities, as well as paintings by his wife.</P>
      <P>Oe was born in a forest-hemmed village in Ehirne Prefecture on the island of
Shikoku. In his Nobel Prize acceptance speech, he described himself as "a son of
forests, " as forests have been a limitless source of his literary inspiration.</P>
      <P>During his childhood,  Oe lived through World War II, an experience that left a
deep life-long imprint on his writings. The ferocity of war, post-war trauma and
the melancholia of death infuse his early works, which are heavily influenced by
Western modernism, according to Peng.</P>
      <P>"As an author, Oe has been engaged in various social and political  issues from
an anti-war,  humanitarian  and liberal perspective," she added.</P>

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Monday:</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Anti-storm measures should not be taken as political show</P>
      <P>We are glad that President Ma Ying-jeou's administration is taking unprecedented
drastic measures to brace for the attacks of Typhoon Parma.</P>
      <P>As extreme weather conditions are becoming more of a rule than an exception,
anti-disaster measures should be considered a routine practice by the
government.</P>
      <P>However, we are worried that the country's politicians from President Ma on down
are putting on a show to get public praise rather than to avoid the disaster.</P>
      <P>Our concerns were stoked by Premier Wu Den-yih's claims that his administration
would prefer to let the public take an unnecessary day off for the typhoon
rather than risk their lives to go to work.</P>
      <P>Whether the day should be taken off during a typhoon is a question which can be
easily determined according to the weather conditions, and an unnecessary
holiday might cost the country NT$2 billion worth of production.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>KMT's problem is not factionism, but the nature of factions.</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) lost lawmaker by-elections in Miaoli and Yulin
counties in tandem, and was defeated in a referendum on whether to allow
gambling in Penghu County.</P>
      <P>Political pundits have blamed factionism within the party for its defeats and
they seem to be right, as local factions in many other counties are threatening
the party's chances for success in their areas in the year-end elections of
local government chiefs.</P>
      <P>But factionism is not endemic to the KMT, as the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) is also rife with factions. But unlike the DPP factions,
the KMT factions are more interested in snapping up benefits than pursuing the
party's goals.</P>
      <P>In order to win elections with local faction support, the party authorities have
to distribute benefits evenly among them.</P>
      <P>The party lost its control of these factions when it could not meet their greed
for benefits.</P>
      <P>This problem may not be solved in the near future, but the KMT will not be able
to thrive if it does not address the issue.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Chinese parade is not what we should be worried about, censorship</P>
      <P>is</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Democratic Progressive Party criticized several local TV
channels for broadcasting the whole process of China's National Day military
parade in Beijing, claiming that it hurt local people's feelings, national
security and constitutes a violation of the law.</P>
      <P>The Government Information Office promised to look into this and to mete out
punishment if any run-ins with the law were found.</P>
      <P>We have to congratulate the DPP for its eventual learning of censorship from its
arch rival Chiang Kai-shek and its eventual forsaking of its founders' cause of
pushing for press freedom.</P>
      <P>Chiang would laugh in his tomb for having the DPP as his followers.</P>
      <P>However, we have to urge the Government Information Office, and President Ma
Ying-jeou's administration to pause and think. Is this a political taboo that a
government which claims to be a follower of liberalism dare to break?</P>
      <P>Don't dismiss the punishment to be meted out by the Government Information
Office as a little wrong step, it will become the beginning of a huge setback
for the country's freedom and democracy.</P>
      <P>The opposition is willing to betray its cause and to debase itself, but the
ruling party should resist the temptation of abusing power and ignore the sirens
of nationalism. It should not forsake the country's hard-earned press freedom
and plunge the nation into the abyss of dictatorship.</P>
      <P>China's military parade is a public event before the eyes of people around the
world. Anyone who is interested in it may watch it via the Internet.</P>
      <P>By the same token, any local TV channel which considers it news-worth may
broadcast it.</P>
      <P>We are not alarmed by TV broadcasts of China's military parade, but we will be
alarmed if the government punishes these channels because it means the revival
of censorship. Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>Government's incompetence will result in problems for the elderly</P>
      <P>The government's latest statistics show that the average life expectancy in
Taiwan is 76 for men and 82 for women.</P>
      <P>Those figures mean that there will be an average of 6.4 years for every man and
8.2 years for every woman when they will need caretakers.</P>
      <P>The cost of taking care of the elderly will be a heavy financial burden both on
their family members and society as a whole.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, we have not seen any attempts on the part of current government
to come to grips with this looming problem.</P>

      <P>The captain and two crew members of a Panama-registered cargo ship that sank off
Taiwan's outlying Penghu Island group were rescued one day later by marine
search and rescue personnel from Taiwan and China, but 11 other crew members
remained missing, the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau said Monday.</P>
      <P>The 1,375-ton Silver Sea sank some 86 nautical miles southwest of Penghu
archipelago Sunday afternoon, while transporting 53 containers from Taiwan to
the Philippines.</P>
      <P>It departed the Kaohsiung port for Manila around noon Saturday.</P>
      <P>The bureau said it received calls for help from the ship at 5: 25 p.m. Sunday
and immediately asked the search command center under the Executive Yuan to
launch rescue operations on the sea and from the air.</P>
      <P>The center swiftly dispatched military rescue helicopters to the area, while
rescue helicopters and two patrol boats were also sent by the Ministry of the
Interior and the Coast Guard Administration to the scene, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>The ship's captain, who is from Myanmar, was rescued by a Chinese ship around 9
a.m. Monday, while two crew members from Indonesia were saved by Taiwan's
vessels and were sent to a hospital in Chiayi County later Monday.</P>
      <P>The Chinese vessel went to the scene after learning of the accident. Taiwan also
sent rescue ships to the area where the ship sank, which is close to the
imaginary middle line separating Taiwan and China in the Taiwan Strait. A Hong
Kong cargo ship also sailed to the spot to help with rescues.</P>
      <P>As of 5: 00 p. m. Monday, the remaining 11 crew members were still missing.</P>
      <P>Although several rescue helicopters were sent to search for the victims, pilots
only saw some containers, the wreckage of the ship and an empty life-saving boat
floating on the sea, the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Tsoying marine base in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung City, has sent
several ships to the area to continue searching for survivors, the center noted.</P>

      <P>The elderly are also entitled to free pneumonia inoculations, offered by the
Wang Chan-yang social welfare and charity foundation run by the Formosa Plastics
Group, which owns CGMH.</P>
      <P>Lin said both the flu and the streptococcus vaccines are safe to take together.</P>
      <P>Lin said that while seasonal flu is not particularly dangerous in itself, it can
cause complications such as pneumonia, which can be fatal.</P>
      <P>Streptococcus pneumonia is the most frequently seen pneumonia killer, Lin
continued, pointing out that the fatality rate among the elderly infected by the
virulent bacteria is 42.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the chance of being attacked by the bacteria again is five times
higher than that of contracting the disease for the first time, he said.</P>
      <P>It was streptococcus pneumonia that prompted the late founder of the Formosa
Plastics Group, Wang Yung-ching, to donate 578,000 doses of streptococcus
pneumonia vaccine in 2007 for people over 75 after he caught the disease but
recovered, according to Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Deputy Director-
General Chou Chih-hao.</P>
      <P>The free vaccination was designed to be carried out over three years starting
from 2007, and there are still about 40,000 doses left for this year, Chou said,
revealing that Wang's foundation has also donated another 57,000 doses to
increase the stock for this year.</P>
      <P>According to CDC statistics, Taiwan has a population of 1.01 million people aged
75 and over, 470,000 of whom have not yet been inoculated with the pneumonia
vaccine, which offers protection for five years.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) reported that day that one
more patient, aged 12, had been hospitalized with severe influenza A(H1N1)
symptoms in the previous 24 hours, bringing the total hospitalization cases to
320 since the outbreak began.</P>
      <P>Of that number, 21 had died, 28 were still being treated in local hospitals,
while the other 270 had been discharged after making complete recoveries.</P>

      <P>Taiwan was holding US$332.24 billion in foreign exchange reserves as of the end
of September, a record high amount that was US$6.82 billion more than the August
figure, the Central Bank of the Republic of China reported Monday.</P>
      <P>Lin Sun-yuan, director-general of the bank's Department of Foreign Exchange,
attributed the increase to earnings from foreign exchange reserve investments,
as well as the strong appreciation of major currencies that it held, such as the
euro and Japanese yen, against the U.S. dollar.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was still ranked as the world's fourth-largest holder of forex reserves,
after China, Japan and Russia and ahead of India, in September.</P>
      <P>China held US$2.13 trillion in forex reserves as of the end of June, increasing
some US$177.9 billion over that posted in March, Lin said. Japan had US$995.7
billion as of the end of August, up US$3.8 billion over that posted in July.</P>
      <P>Russia, the world's third-largest forex reserve holder, had US$367.5 billion as
of the end of August, up by US$15.2 billion from July.</P>
      <P>India, meanwhile, had US$263.5 billion in forex reserves as of September 25, up
US$3 billion from August.</P>
      <P>South Korea's forex reserves as of September  is not yet available. It held
US$240.9 billion at the end of August, up US$4.4 billion from July.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Rebuilding of major southern bridge not to rely on Chinese funds</HEADLINE>

10/05/09  21:22:43
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih ruled out the possibility Monday of using China-donated funds
to rebuild a major bridge in southern Taiwan that was destroyed during the
onslaught of Typhoon Morakot in early August.</P>
      <P>"We have politely rejected the proposal  of using Chinese donations to finance
reconstruction of the Shuangyuan Bridge over the Gaoping River, " Wu said at a
Legislative Yuan committee meeting Monday afternoon.</P>
      <P>He was responding to a question from opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) Legislator Huang Wei-cher on how China's pledge of NT$5.1 billion in funds
for post-typhoon rehabilitation will be used.</P>
      <P>Wu said the government has so far received only about NT$900 million (US$27.86
million) of the amount promised by Beijing.</P>
      <P>"China intends to have the remaining funds used to finance selected
infrastructure reconstruction projects, with the names of Chinese donors
engraved on them," Wu said.</P>
      <P>After China's Sichuan province was rattled by a devastating earthquake in May
2008, Taiwanese companies donated funds for the reconstruction of certain major
infrastructure projects, and China wants to follow that example, Wu said.</P>
      <P>In response to a question from DPP Legislator Pan Men-an, Wu had suggested in
the morning session of the committee hearing that funds from China might be used
to finance reconstruction of the Shuangyuan Bridge, which connected Kaohsiung
County's Linyuan township and Pingtung County's Sinyuan township until it
collapsed Aug. 9.</P>
      <P>In the afternoon session, however, Wu ruled out that possibility.</P>
      <P>"After a careful assessment, we think it is inappropriate to have the bridge
financed with Chinese funds, " Wu said, without further explanation.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan will consider allocating Chinese donations to other projects
and will exercise prudence in selecting the most suitable ones, Wu added.</P>
      <P>The Shuangyuan Bridge reconstruction  project will cost an estimated NT$3
billion, including the cost of building a temporary bridge until the 2.8 km
bridge is rebuilt, according to an Executive Yuan assessment.</P>
      <P>The project is scheduled to begin in February 2010 and be completed by December
2012.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will decide by the end of the year whether local flat panel and
chip manufacturers can invest in facilities or buy stakes in other companies in
China, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>"Relevant government agencies will conduct a cross-ministerial meeting on the
issue later this year to set a clear course for the future development of the
two local sectors," MOEA officials said.</P>
      <P>Apart from the key condition that it must be beneficial to Taiwan's people, a
clear policy that helps the two local industries get a foothold in China's
market without leading to the hollowing out of Taiwan will be adopted by the end
of this year, they said.</P>
      <P>Economics Minister Shih Yen-shiang said at the end of September that companies
in the two sectors would be allowed to invest in China to help them secure
China's market and prevent it from looking toward partners from other countries
such as South Korea to acquire related technologies.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwanese chipmakers are limited to investing in plants in China
that use the older 8-inch wafer technology.</P>
      <P>A local newspaper reported on Monday that workers at some flat panel and chip
companies headquartered in the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park are worried
about losing their jobs if their employers were allowed to invest in advanced
technology processes in China.</P>
      <P>In response to the report, the Industrial Development Bureau made it clear
Monday that the policy will fully heed public concern that such relations with
China must not affect the interests of Taiwan's people.</P>
      <P>Even if high-tech companies are permitted to invest in China on a case-by-case
basis,  government  policy  will still take into consideration the Wassenaar
Agreement to mitigate adverse effects on Taiwanese enterprises, bureau officials
said.</P>
      <P>The agreement is signed by some 40 countries to prevent exports of sensitive
technology with potential military uses to certain countries, including China,
North Korea and Iraq.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's statistical agency unveiled cost-of-living indexes for the
first time Monday in line with Premier Wu Den-yih's pledge to make economic
indicators more relevant to the everyday lives of ordinary people.</P>
      <P>The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) prepared
three cost-of-living indexes to more precisely reflect the fluctuation of prices
for goods and services in three categories.</P>
      <P>The first cost-of-living index was figured out mainly based on the costs of
food, fuel and electricity while the second index covers a basket of 244 items,
including food, education and entertainment, such as travel, extra schooling
fees and electronic products and computers.</P>
      <P>The third index covers 239 items, including food and other daily necessities,
such as clothing, toilet paper and shampoo.</P>
      <P>According to the DGBAS tallies, September's first cost-of-living index stood at
113.97, down 1.23 percent from the month-earlier level.</P>
      <P>The second cost-of-living index stood at 109.26 in September, falling 1.14
percent from the August level,  while the third cost-of-living index stood at
110.36, down 1.11 percent from August.</P>
      <P>"Compared with the traditional consumer price index (CPI) , all three cost-of-
living indexes registered bigger falls than the CPI, " said Wu Chao-ming, a
DGBAS section chief in charge of calculating and monitoring consumer price
fluctuations.</P>
      <P>The CPI stood at 105.49 in September, down only 0.65 percent from August, Wu
said.</P>
      <P>The larger drops in the three cost-of-living indexes mainly resulted from
substantial declines in vegetable, egg and electricity prices during the period,
down 12.54 percent, 5.64 percent and 11.62 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>"These three items account for a larger weight in the first cost-of-living index
than in the CPI, thus resulting in a larger decline in the cost-of-living
index," Wu explained.</P>
      <P>In preparing the CPI index, Wu said, the agency covers 424 items.</P>
      <P>"With a view to make the index better reflect the average person's feelings and
their everyday lives, the first cost-of-living index selected only 190 items
from those gauged in the CPI, with food prices accounting for 80 percent of the
index," Wu elaborated.</P>
      <P>The first index also includes the costs of natural gas and electricity as well
as fuel costs, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The second cost-of-living index covers 244 items -- the 190 items calculated in
the first index plus 54 others in the education and entertainment categories.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu said the consumer price index dropped 0.86 percent in September
from the year-earlier level. It marked the eighth consecutive monthly decline
since Feburary.</P>
      <P>The price decline was slightly larger than August's 0.8 percent, but Wu said the
figure did not signal any risk of further economic contraction as the economic
recession has gradually bottomed out.</P>

      <P>The government intends to lure more investment from Taiwanese firms based in
China by touting six new star industries, a Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)

      <P>Yu Chi-cheng, deputy director of the MOEA's Department of Industrial Services,
touted the benefits of investing in Taiwan at a gathering of China-based
Taiwanese businessmen in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung City to celebrate the Mid-

      <P>Yu was trying to solicit investment in six star industries that Taiwan's

      <P>Among the 200 attendees were Kao Koong-lian, vice chairman and secretary-general
of the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)  and over 100
representatives of Taiwanese businessmen's associations in China.</P>
      <P>At the gathering, Yu also noted that total investment in Taiwan by local
businessmen operating in China had already beat the target set by the MOEA for
2009.</P>
      <P>The amount of capital injected by overseas Taiwan businessmen into the domestic
market between September 2006 and September this year totaled NT$71.7 billion

operations in China, Yu said.</P>
      <P>The balance of the investment was made by Taiwanese businessmen in the United
States, Canada and Southeast Asian countries.</P>
      <P>China-based  Taiwanese  businessmen  launched 110 investment projects in Taiwan

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih demanded Monday that government agencies act swiftly against
so-called fat cat CEOs in affiliated organizations or foundations, especially
those who are earning two monthly salaries.</P>
      <P>Wu was responding  to questions  during a hearing at the Legislative Yuan,
during which ruling Kuomintang lawmaker Lin Teh-fu said these overpaid
executives had triggered negative sentiment among the public.</P>
      <P>"Some retired government officials now hired in government-run spin-offs or
nonprofit organizations not only are earning two salaries every month -- one
from their previous post in the government and one from their current job -- but
also enjoy a high interest rate of 18 percent on their bank deposits," Lin said.</P>
      <P>"That has provoked strong criticism from society."</P>
      <P>Wu promised  to fully  weed  out all such  personnel  in government-affiliated
enterprises and organizations based on relevant laws and regulations. "But we
cannot recklessly attack people, because there will be trouble if we're wrong,"
he stressed.</P>
      <P>It was reported that the Ministry of Economics Affairs has the largest number of
such enterprises or nonprofit organizations under its jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>Some of the top executives in these businesses get two salaries totaling over
NT$300,000 (US$9,300) per month -- more than a government minister makes, the
report said.</P>
      <P>Liu Ming-chung, director of the MOEA's Commission of National Corporations,
dismissed the report, however, and said that monthly salaries  for  ranking
CEOs  and  full-time  advisers  at 15 MOEA-affiliated businesses are set at
NT$80,000 or lower, in line with regulations which were already revised in July.</P>
      <P>"All of them get only one salary from their present posts, and no one continues
receiving another salary from their previous posts in the government," he
explained.</P>
      <P>"All newly employed CEOs and advisers will be compensated in compliance with the
new regulations."</P>
      <P>According  to Liu,  the MOEA runs 35 such companies  and organizations such as
Taiwan Power Company, Aerospace Industrial Development Corp and Chinese
Petroleum Corp. (Taiwan).</P>
      <P>The ministry currently hires 89 part-time and full-time advisers at these

      <P>The larger drops in the three cost-of-living indexes mainly resulted from
substantial declines in vegetable, egg and electricity prices during the period,
down 12.54 percent, 5.64 percent and 11.62 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>"These three items account for a larger weight in the first cost-of-living index
than in the CPI, thus resulting in a larger decline in the cost-of-living
index," Wu explained.</P>
      <P>In preparing the CPI index, Wu said, the agency covers 424 items.</P>
      <P>"With a view to make the index better reflect the average person's feelings and
their everyday lives, the first cost-of-living index selected only 190 items
from those gauged in the CPI, with food prices accounting for 80 percent of the
index," Wu elaborated.</P>
      <P>The first index also includes the costs of natural gas and electricity as well
as fuel costs, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The second cost-of-living index covers 244 items -- the 190 items calculated in
the first index plus 54 others in the education and entertainment categories.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu said the consumer price index dropped 0.86 percent in September
from the year-earlier level. It marked the eighth consecutive monthly decline
since Feburary.</P>
      <P>The price decline was slightly larger than August's 0.8 percent, but Wu said the
figure did not signal any risk of further economic contraction as the economic
recession has gradually bottomed out.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Gov't to act on 'fat cat' CEOs: premier</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  5 (CNA)
10/06/09  09:20:51
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih demanded Monday that government agencies act swiftly against
so-called fat cat CEOs in affiliated organizations or foundations, especially
those who are earning two monthly salaries.</P>
      <P>Wu was responding  to questions  during a hearing at the Legislative Yuan,
during which ruling Kuomintang lawmaker Lin Teh-fu said these overpaid
executives had triggered negative sentiment among the public.</P>
      <P>"Some retired government officials now hired in government-run spin-offs or
nonprofit organizations not only are earning two salaries every month -- one
from their previous post in the government and one from their current job -- but
also enjoy a high interest rate of 18 percent on their bank deposits," Lin said.</P>
      <P>"That has provoked strong criticism from society."</P>
      <P>Wu promised  to fully  weed  out all such  personnel  in government-affiliated
enterprises and organizations based on relevant laws and regulations. "But we
cannot recklessly attack people, because there will be trouble if we're wrong,"
he stressed.</P>
      <P>It was reported that the Ministry of Economics Affairs has the largest number of
such enterprises or nonprofit organizations under its jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>Some of the top executives in these businesses get two salaries totaling over
NT$300,000 (US$9,300) per month -- more than a government minister makes, the
report said.</P>
      <P>Liu Ming-chung, director of the MOEA's Commission of National Corporations,
dismissed the report, however, and said that monthly salaries  for  ranking
CEOs  and  full-time  advisers  at 15 MOEA-affiliated businesses are set at
NT$80,000 or lower, in line with regulations which were already revised in July.</P>
      <P>"All of them get only one salary from their present posts, and no one continues
receiving another salary from their previous posts in the government," he
explained.</P>
      <P>"All newly employed CEOs and advisers will be compensated in compliance with the
new regulations."</P>
      <P>According  to Liu,  the MOEA runs 35 such companies  and organizations such as
Taiwan Power Company, Aerospace Industrial Development Corp and Chinese
Petroleum Corp. (Taiwan).</P>
      <P>The ministry currently hires 89 part-time and full-time advisers at these
businesses.</P>

      <P>A variety of activities for the elderly will be held in the central county of
Miaoli in October to celebrate the "Chong Yang Festival," county government
officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>The activities include gate ball matches and an achievement show for elderly
people attending classes, the officials said at a press conference. The
traditional festival -- also known as the "Old Men Festival" -- is celebrated on
the ninth day of the ninth lunar month, and the elderly are especially
encouraged to take part in the activities.</P>
      <P>The county is home to 52 people aged 100 or above, and has more than 18,000
people over 80 years of age, according to data provided by the county
government.</P>
      <P>One couple that has been married for 61 years was invited to attend the press

grandchildren.</P>
      <P>Fan also noted that he makes all the decisions outside the home, while
everything  inside  the home is left to his wife for decision-making. "That is
always the key to avoiding conflict, " he said with a twinkle.</P>

      <P>As Typhoon Parma veers away from Taiwan, it has left one person dead, caused
flooding in 30 areas in Yilan County, and forced 6,831 people to be evacuated
from their homes as of Monday night, the Central Emergency Operation Center
(CEOC) reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A 43-year-old man living in Beinan township in southeastern Taiwan's Taitung
County, surnamed Wei, drowned after falling in a flooded river, the center said.</P>
      <P>Heavy rains from the typhoon triggered serious flooding in Yilan in northeastern
Taiwan, submerging Yilan City and townships including Sansing, Wujie, Dongshan,
Jhuangwei, Datong, Toucheng and Luodong in waters ranging between 10-50
centimeters high.</P>
      <P>The CEOC said that between Sunday dawn and 9 p.m. Monday, Hansi in Dongshan
township received 1,121 mm of rainfall, the most of anywhere in Taiwan, followed
by 1,046 mm in Sansing, and 949 mm in Datong township's Niudou.</P>
      <P>Other areas affected by the storm were Hejhong in Hualien County's Sioulin
township, which received 671 mm of rain, and Rueifang town in Taipei County,
which recorded rainfall of 444 mm, the center said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 74 rivers on the island were given red alerts for flooding, including
56 in Yilan County and 18 in Hualien County.</P>
      <P>Another 227 rivers had yellow alerts, indicating that nearby residents should be
aware of possible flooding, the Soil and Water Conservation Bureau under the
Council of Agriculture (COA) reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In addition, the COA issued landslide red alerts for 109 areas -- all in Yilan
and Hualien counties, suggesting local governments to "forcibly" evacuate
residents to safe places.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Parma has weakened to a tropical storm after its periphery swept over
the southern tip of Taiwan Monday.</P>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau reported that as of 8:30 a.m. Tuesday, the storm was
centered 310 km south-southwest of Eluanbi, at Taiwan's southernmost tip, moving
in a south-southwesterly direction at a speed of 10 km per hour.</P>
      <P>The bureau maintained its sea warning for the storm after lifting its land
warning the previous night.</P>
      <P>Under the joint influence of the storm's outer rim and the northeast monsoon,
the weather bureau predicted Tuesday that rainfall in Hualien County will
increase to 800-1,200 mm in mountainous areas and 500-700 mm in lowland areas.</P>
      <P>It warned people in the northeastern and eastern areas of Taiwan to remain on
the alert for torrential rains.</P>

      <P>Students from Tamkang University won a special award at the 4th International
Architecture  Biennale Rotterdam (IABR) with a collective design called "Spatial
Limbo," the Danshuei, Taipei County-based university said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Spatial Limbo" -- designed by six postgraduate and undergraduate students from
Tamkang's Department of Architecture -- won a Special Mention Award at the
Parallel Cases exhibition for offering an inventive and creative approach to the
biennale's theme, "Open City: Designing Coexistence."</P>
      <P>This marked the first time that a student group from Taiwan has won an award at
the prestigious IABR.</P>
      <P>The Parallel Cases exhibition, which displayed 44 entries chosen from 280 works
submitted by universities around the world, allowed teams to imagine how
architectural and urban development projects can help contribute to social
cohesion in future cities.</P>
      <P>"Spatial Limbo" uses words, drawings, photos and models to describe four
peripheral urban areas in Taiwan that have not come to terms with urban
development in the fast process of social change.</P>
      <P>The four areas included a naval fuel plant, a commercial complex with beehive-
like units, a cluster of shanty homes on the edge of a big city and a seaside
residential hill.</P>
      <P>"We didn't want to let our design fall into a stereotyped framework, which
promotes the idea that old or defunct spaces must be renewed or rejuvenated, "
said Chen Yung-yu, one of the six student designers.</P>
      <P>"The existence of peripheral spaces also serve as a medium to reflect the
absurdities of cities, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>Another design by another group of architecture students from Tamkang, called
"Zhongxin, " also made it into the Parallel Cases exhibition.</P>
      <P>"Zhongxin" is a park design based on a now defunct village for dependents of
military personnel, more commonly known in Taiwan as "juancun." The design
turned space in Taipei City's Beitou district into a "juancun" park.</P>
      <P>"We studied the lifestyle of military dependents in a bid to preserve the unique
'juancun' culture and history, " said Chang Wei-ju, one of the work's seven
student designers.</P>
      <P>The 4th IABR, being held in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, opened Sept. 25 and is
scheduled to run until Jan. 10, 2010.</P>
      <P>Tamkang and Harvard Graduate School of Design are the only two schools from
around the world to have two entries in the Parallel Cases exhibition,
university officials said.</P>

      <P>Local governments should retain the power to decide whether to close schools and
offices as a threatening typhoon approaches, Premier Wu Den-yih said Tuesday
amid calls for the central government to take over the job.</P>
      <P>Yilan County residents have criticized the county government for repeatedly
changing its mind on whether to call for school and office closings as Typhoon
Parma approached, leading to suggestions that the central government get
involved in the decision-making process.</P>
      <P>Wu said local governments have had the authority to decide on suspending class
and work over the past two to three decades and that he believes the judgment of
local governments can better reflect the actual situation on the ground.</P>
      <P>He also defended the Yilan County government, saying it did not believe it had
vacillated in deciding school and office closings as Parma dumped heavy rain in
the northeastern Taiwan county.</P>
      <P>Wu admitted,  however,  that the central government should reinforce its data
analysis so that it can offer more accurate information to local governments to
help them make their decisions.</P>
      <P>On the call for the Executive Yuan to take the authority to decide closings, the
premier said he "is willing to carefully weigh whether to have different
authorities hold the power."</P>
      <P>The Yilan County government announced at 8 a.m. Monday that schools would be
closed beginning noon that day after the Central Weather Bureau updated its
rainfall prediction to a higher level of alert.</P>
      <P>Its decision, however, to authorize local township chiefs to decide whether or
not to close offices plunged the county into chaos, as some townships worked
while others did not.</P>
      <P>Only at 11: 30 a.m. did the county government announce that all offices in the
county would be closed, too late for some parents to take their children home
from school, according to a local newspaper report.</P>

      <P>The minimum level of precipitation to prompt school and office closures has been
set tentatively at 350 mm per day, the head of the Central Personnel
Administration said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Basically, local city or county governments can announce class or office
closures in the event that 350 mm of precipitation is recorded in a single day
in their areas of jurisdiction, " Wu Tai-cheng said at aquestion and answer
session at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks in response to a suggestion by ruling Kuomintang Legislator
Lu Shiow-yen that the Executive Yuan include precipitation as one of the factors
used by local governments to decide whether to close schools and workplaces in
the event of a typhoon or floods.</P>
      <P>Later, Premier Wu Den-yih said he seconded Lu's suggestion, adding that mudslide
predictions should also be another factor, in addition to wind strength.</P>
      <P>He said that particularly in remote areas, disaster prevention can be more
effective if the relevant orders are issued by local governments rather than the
Executive Yuan because time and distance could impact on the Cabinet's response.</P>
      <P>Around noon Tuesday,  the Central Personnel  Administration announced  that it
will  convene  a meeting  of the relevant Cabinet-level agencies and local
governments around the country Wednesday to work out a new mechanism under which
the local governments could have autonomy regarding class and office closures
and could simultaneously inform the central government of their decisions.</P>

      <P>Gray-faced buzzard eagles, also known as the "National Day Bird," will soon pass
through southern Taiwan's Kenting for about 20 days, the Construction and
Planning Agency under the Ministry of the Interior (CPAMI) said in a statement
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>To welcome this rare species of migratory bird, listed in Appendix II of the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) , the Kenting
National Park will hold an annual eagle-watching event that will include various
bird-watching and environmental education activities.</P>
      <P>Appendix II includes species for which trade must be controlled to "avoid
utilization incompatible with their survival."</P>
      <P>The gray-faced buzzard may be the most famous of 200 bird species that transit
through Kenting National Park every year as they migrate, and because its
migration period usually comes around Oct. 10, Taiwan's national day, it is
nicknamed the "National Day Bird."</P>
      <P>Gray-faced buzzards usually rest in Kenting for about 20 days from early to mid-
October and can be seen flying in groups above the ocean.</P>
      <P>The best place to see the birds, according to the CPAMI statement, is in the

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Tuesday:</P>
      <P>Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>Education myth</P>
      <P>The Kuomintang has vowed to choose a highly educated candidate to compete in the
race for magistrate in Yunlin County, after its original nominee dropped out of
the race.</P>
      <P>In the party's view, people with higher education degrees always have a clean
image and are not linked to local factions.</P>
      <P>This is a myth that originated in Confucianism, which asserts that education
improves character. This myth has persisted not only in Taiwan's political
circles but also in its business circles.</P>
      <P>Actually there is no evidence that people with high education have more
integrity or capability than ordinary people.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Our two cents on health insurance premium hikes</P>
      <P>Health Minister Yaung Chih-liang announced last week a new formula for
calculating National Health Insurance premiums under which the maximum income
basis on which premiums are calculated will be raised from NT$131,000 to
NT$259,000.</P>
      <P>Therefore, people with salaries of NT$260,000 or higher per month will see their
premiums increase from NT$6,000 to NT$12,000 per month.</P>
      <P>Former Health Minister Yeh Ching-chuan had proposed to raise premiums by
calculating them based on the insured's total income rather than simply salary.</P>
      <P>Since the income of many wealthy people consists of capital gains and dividens
rather than salaries, we believe Yeh's proposal is more reasonable and will
inject life into the cash-strapped insurance program for a longer period.</P>
      <P>Yuang should explain why he chose an option which doesn't seem to be the best
way out.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Local political factions should refuse to serve Kuomintang</P>
      <P>In the wake of the Kuomintang's defeat in the legislative by-election in Yunlin
County, President Ma Ying-jeou said he prefers to lose than to cooperate with
dirty local faction leaders.</P>
      <P>He has shown his contempt for local factions just as did the late President
Chiang Kai-shek, who was described by late Shanghai gangster kingpin Du Yueh-
sheng as considering Du his chamber pot, which he "puts under the bed after
using it."</P>
      <P>The KMT repeated its trick in Taiwan by colluding with local factions to control
the island, and that now constitutes the party's major vulnerability.</P>
      <P>President Ma also considers factions as chamber pots, so he blamed them for his
party's loss in Yunlin County while playing down his poor performance on the
job.</P>
      <P>Local factions are not endemic to Taiwan. They have played significant roles in
other democratic countries.</P>
      <P>We will be glad if the ruling party is determined to sever ties with local
factions, and we urge local factions to stop serving as the KMT's chamber pots
and give Taiwan a chance for the development of a healthy democracy.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Taiwan survives Typhoon Parma, but will it survive future storms?</P>
      <P>Typhoon Parma has not caused serious damage to Taiwan, thanks to the all-out
efforts of President Ma's administration, but the governments of several
counties where typhoon warnings were in effect barely escaped major damage.</P>
      <P>Parma was erratic, with an unpredictable course and influence on Taiwan,
complicated by the movement of the nearby Typhoon Melor and a prevailing monsoon
in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Scientists have warned that the earth is entering into a peak storm period in a
thousand-year cycle because of global warming. Taiwan must improve the accuracy
of its weather forecasting to enable it to be adequately prepared if it wants to
survive future storms.</P>
      <P>The general public's awareness of disasters should also be raised.</P>

      <P>An integrated drive has been launched to teach elderly citizens the correct way
to take medicines to avoid side effects and waste of medical resources, the
Taiwan Health Care Reform Foundation said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A total of 455 health-care related facilities, including 17 university
hospitals, 43 regional hospitals, 53 community hospitals, 54 sanitation offices
and outpatient service centers, and 288 drug stores, had joined the foundation's
campaign as of Oct. 2, and have jointly created a Web site dedicated to the
effort, a foundation spokesman said.</P>
      <P>These  health-care  enterprises,  which  are  voluntarily participating in the
campaign, will teach elderly patients how to take medicine and will offer free
consultations on the Web site -- www.thrf.org.tw/elder/, he added.</P>
      <P>Citing information provided by the Taipei Veterans General Hospital, the
spokesman said one elderly patient was found to have taken in one month more
than 200 pills that were prescribed by several different departments of the same
hospital.</P>
      <P>According to the hospital, senior patients have an average of 1.3 to 1.8 chronic
diseases and may have to take more than 10 tablets daily as prescribed by
various doctors, if the patients attend 1.65 to 3.31 clinics a day on average.</P>
      <P>The foundation also cited the case of a 75-year-old man who was taking more than
10 different kinds of medication a day, which were prescribed by doctors from
different hospital departments to treat his benign prostatic hiperplasia,
constipation and insomnia. However, that led to him having excessive doses of
tranquillizers, the foundation added.</P>
      <P>As this is common senario among elderly patients, the Bureau of National Health
Insurance has been encouraging hospitals to open special outpatient clinics as a
one-stop service for elderly people with multiple chronic diseases.</P>
      <P>Some local governments, such as Taipei County,  have been collaborating with
local pharmacist associations to set up a home visit service for senior
patients, which would include keeping track of medication use and dosage.</P>

      <P>National Cheng Kung University in the southern city of Tainan signed a joint
venture agreement with the privately owned Taiwan Nitride Material Inc.  Tuesday
for the production of aluminum nitride (AlN), a synthesized material used in
electronics applications.</P>
      <P>The agreement was formally signed at NCKU by Hwang Hwang-hweng, a senior
executive vice president at the university, and H.H. Chang, chairman of Taiwan
Nitride Material.</P>
      <P>Under the joint venture plan, the two sides will jointly invest a total of NT$30
million (US$932,000) initially for research and development of AlN, a
semiconductor material widely used for heat radiation and insulation in
applications in the ultraviolet optoelectronics industry.</P>
      <P>The project -- one of many initiated by the National Science Council to foster
cross-discipline innovation -- is expected to yield profits totaling at least
NT$100 million in the first 10 years, according to NCKU.</P>
      <P>The joint venture is also one of NCKU's six investment projects, which include
aquaculture  oral bacterial  vaccine preparation, development  of  healthy
herbs,  copper  resources  recycling, bio-surfactant products, and AlN
electronic substrate metallization, according to Hwung.</P>
      <P>AlN is stable at high temperatures in inert atmospheres and melts at 2800
degrees Celsius. In the air, surface oxidation occurs above 700 degrees and even
at room temperature, and surface oxide layers of 5-10 nm have been detected.
This oxide layer protects the material at temperatures of up to 1370 degrees
Celsius.</P>
      <P>It dissolves slowly in mineral acids through grain boundary attack, and in
strong alkalies through attack on the aluminum nitride grains. The material
hydrolyzes slowly in water. AlN is resistant to attack from most molten salts,
including chlorides and cryolite.</P>
      <P>Among the applications of AlN are optoelectronics, dielectric layers in optical
storage media, electronic substrates and chip carriers where high thermal
conductivity is essential.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's democratic politics is believed to be able to help speed up the
development of democracy in China as the Beijing turns increasingly strong on
the international political stage thanks to its big economic power, Mainland
Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lai made the remarks while making a keynote speech at an annual gathering of
overseas Chinese who live in Europe. The group had gathered in Taipei for an
annual visit.</P>
      <P>In her speech, Lai underlined the gradual reconciliation between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait,  describing the improved cross-strait ties as the greatest
change in Taiwan over the past 16 months.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been promoting the development  of cross-strait relations based on
the principles of not seeking unification, independence or military invasion.</P>
      <P>The improvement in cross-strait relations from the hostile stand-off that
existed between the two sides in the past has won Taiwan the title of a "peace
maker" instead of "trouble maker "in the Asia-Pacific region, Lai said.</P>
      <P>Speaking of Taiwan's strategies in pushing for the development of cross-strait
ties under the leadership of President Ma Ying-jeou, the official in charge of
Taiwan's affairs with the mainland said the first step was recovering the long-
frozen dialogues and negotiations between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the resumption in talks, the two sides reached agreements with each
other on many economic and trade problems over the past year, Lai said.</P>
      <P>She noted that now Taiwan is making efforts to push for the signing of the
proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA), a type of free-trade
agreement, with China in the hope that Taiwan can recover its international
economic competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Ma argues the agreement is necessary in order for Taiwan not to lose out to
China's other trade partners, who will enjoy low tariffs or tariff-free access
to the Chinese market once they sign free-trade agreements with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Such an agreement, however, has stirred debate in Taiwan, with the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party and others expressing fears it could make Taiwan's
economy too dependent on China.</P>
      <P>Lai on Tuesday also said that the time is not yet ripe for the Taiwan and China
to begin discussing political issues or issues concerning the establishment of a
military mutual-trust mechanism between Taiwan and China.</P>

of umbilical cord blood transplants in treating paralysis, a common post-stroke
symptom, and it was found that a transplant helped improve the mice's
conditions.</P>
      <P>Researchers  have also launched experiments on the use of umbilical cord blood
transplants in the treatment of dementia, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the experiments on the use of umbilical cord blood in treating
diabetes have entered human trials, he said.</P>
      <P>In the experiments, stem cells obtained from umbilical cord blood were cultured

      <P>The Japanese government did not refuse to help the Taiwanese fishing boat that
suffered a minor mutiny, but there were differences among Japanese agencies on
how to handle the crew and the boat, which is currently on its way back to
Taiwan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Based on humanitarian concerns, the Japanese government agreed to let the boat
enter its harbor, but it was still negotiating with us on the details of how to
deal with the crew, " MOFA deputy spokesman James Chang said at a regular press
briefing.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, a mutiny broke out on the Pintung-based "Yu Chun No.
166" fishing vessel while it was operating in the Pacific Ocean.</P>
      <P>The reports said that the Taiwanese captain Shih Chin-shing called his family
Oct. 2 via satellite phone and said he and his chief engineer had locked
themselves in the navigation room after two of eight Indonesian crew members
threatened their lives with knives.</P>
      <P>The captain turned the boat toward Japan's Bonin Islands -- known in Japan as
the Ogasawara Group -- some 1,000 kilometers south of Tokyo and asked the
Japanese government for permission to dock but the request was refused, the
reports said.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, after learning about the captain's request, the MOFA started
negotiating with Tokyo. Japan's Fisheries Agency agreed to let the fishing boat
pull into shore, but its Immigration Bureau had concerns on how to handle the
boat and its crew, he added.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan and Japan were still negotiating on the details of the matter, the
captain of the Taiwanese fishing boat decided to head back to Taiwan, as weather
conditions had improved with Typhoon Melor's movement away from the area, Chang
said.</P>
      <P>"Humanitarian aid is a universal value, and the Japanese government promised to
protect the safety of the Taiwanese captain and his chief engineer, but it was
concerned about how to handle the eight Indonesian crew members and the boat,"
Chang said.</P>
      <P>With the boat now heading back to Taiwan, the Coast Guard Administration
embarked on a mission later Tuesday afternoon to escort it home, which would
take 8-9 days, he added.</P>
      <P>The MOFA has also asked Japan to send a coast guard vessel to protect the
Taiwanese boat on its way back, but the Japanese government has yet to respond
to that request, Chang said.</P>

      <P>Nearly 67 percent of Taiwan's enterprises plan to recruit employees in the
fourth quarter of this year, in a sign that its economic climate is taking a
turn for the better, the results of a survey showed Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the 104 Job Bank survey, salesmen are most wanted by the
enterprises planning to hire new workers in the current quarter.</P>
      <P>Sales representatives accounted for 37.3 percent of all the talent to be hunted,
followed by marketing personnel which made up 15.6 percent of sought-after
talent, and engineering R&amp;D personnel at 12.2 percent, the survey showed.</P>
      <P>Enterprises in the monetary and insurance sectors topped the list of local
companies which want to hire new staff, followed by those in the health care and
environmental protection, IT, construction and real estate, and manufacturing
sectors, in that order, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>The enterprises cited a need to have more salesmen to cope with the growth in
business.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 35.6 percent of the people who are currently employed
and whose salaries have remained unchanged for the past two years, plan to look
for another job, mostly as salesmen, in a bid to get higher pay and to expand
their public connections.</P>
      <P>Employees in the health care and environmental protection sectors get the
highest pay, with average annual salaries reaching NT$758,000 (US$22,830),
followed by those in the IT sector with NT$650,000 in salary, the mass
communications sector with NT$634,000, and the transportation and manufacturing
sectors, both at NT$600,000.</P>
      <P>Chiu Wen-jen, director general of marketing for the 104 Job Bank, said that on
average, college graduates who serve as salesmen earned NT$2,000 more monthly
than their counterparts working in administrative jobs in the beginning, but the
gap in pay may expand to 23 percent three years later and even to 34 percent
after five years.</P>
      <P>Huang Wen-yao, head of the bank's China Man Hunt Department, said that Taiwan's
sales talents have been welcomed in the mainland's job market because of their

    <HEADLINE>Daily folic acid intake helps reduce cancer risk: local research</HEADLINE>

10/06/09  19:21:17
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Adequate folic acid intake can help reduce cancer risk, particularly the risk of
incurring breast cancer, a local researcher said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Eating a plate of dark green vegetables daily could help lower the risk of
breast cancer by 20 percent to 40 percent, " said Sun Chien-an, a professor at
Fujen Catholic University's Department of Public Health.</P>
      <P>"Eating a bit of pork liver occasionally is also helpful in reducing cancer
risk," he added.</P>
      <P>Sun made the comments based on the findings of a research project that he has
been conducting over the past 10 years at the request of the Cabinet-level
Department of Health (DOH) on the correlation between local people's folic acid
intake and the risk of cancer.</P>
      <P>Sun said his research team analyzed the findings of the 1992-1996 national
nutrition surveys, conducted blood tests on residents in two townships --
Hsinchu County's Jhudong and Chiayi County's Putzih -- and tracked the changes
for more than 10 years.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the team factored in information from databanks that recorded the
condition of local cancer patients and causes of death, Sun said.</P>
      <P>According to the findings of the research project, the incidence of breast
cancer among the group of people who took more than 415 micrograms (mg) of folic
acid daily was 25 percent lower than among those whose daily intake of folic
acid was less than 260 mg.</P>
      <P>The research also found that the incidence of breast cancer was 44 percent lower
among those who had folic acid concentrations of more than 17.2 nanogram (ng)
per 100 milliliters (ml) in their blood than among those who recorded folic acid
concentrations of 7.2 ng or less per 100 ml.</P>
      <P>A further analysis of the data collected in the study showed that the incidence
of various forms of cancer among those whose daily folic acid intake exceeded
415 mg over the past 15 years was only 8 percent, as compared to 9.7 percent
among those whose daily intake fell below the daily minimum.</P>
      <P>"These findings indicate that foods rich in folic acid can help ward off
cancer," Sun said.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Lin Hsueh-jung, director of the DOH's Bureau of
Food Safety, said people's daily folic acid intake should increase with age.</P>
      <P>"For those younger than 4, the daily intake of folic acid should be no less than
200 mg, and for those aged 13 and over it should be more than 400 mg," Lin said,
adding that the minimum daily intake for pregnant women should be at least 600
mg.</P>
      <P>Noting that folic acid is a water-soluble vitamin necessary for human cell
division and growth, Lin said it is found widely in natural foods, including
dark green vegetables such as asparagus, broccoli and cabbage, as well as in
whole grains, beans, animal livers and foods containing yeast.</P>
      <P>"One can get 400 mg of folic acid by eating 17 small stems of asparagus or 2.25
bowls of broccoli, " Lin said, adding that people who eat out often can get
adequate amounts of folic acid from vegetable salads and yeast.</P>
      <P>According to the results of national nutrition surveys, the intake of folic acid
among local people tends to be less than half of the suggested amount and the
deficiency is most serious in the 13-18 age group.</P>
      <P>Lin said foreign researchers have also found that adequate folic acid intake can
significantly lower the risk of colorectal cancer and can also help prevent many
other forms of cancer, including cervical cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer,
colon cancer and gastric cancer.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's government plans to cut its projected expenditures for next year by
NT$4.8 billion to improve efficiency in the utilization of government funds,
Premier Wu Den-yih said Tuesday, while giving a report to the legislature on the
central government's budget for the next fiscal year.</P>
      <P>The NT$4.8 billion had originally been earmarked for the purchase of helicopters
by the Ministry of the Interior for disaster relief work, the implementation of
several transportation infrastructure projects and the construction of the
Hushan Reservoir in Yunlin County. These planned expenditures have now been
canceled.</P>
      <P>The revised budget for next year will be NT$1.735 trillion, which will be used
mainly to boost economic development and to pay for disaster reconstruction and
prevention in light of Typhoon Morakot, which caused widespread destruction in
Taiwan in August, killing more than 600 people.</P>
      <P>The new Cabinet made the budgetary adjustments after withdrawing the general
budget bill drawn up by the previous premier's Cabinet and resubmitting it to
the Legislative Yuan for further review.</P>
      <P>According  to the new general budget bill,  the projected expenditures of
NT$1.735 trillion will be down NT$74.7 billion from the current fiscal year.</P>
      <P>If projected revenues of NT$1.552 trillion, down NT$121.2 billion from the
current fiscal year, are realized, there would be a deficit of NT$183 billion,
Wu said.</P>
      <P>The government will have to take out a loan of NT$249 billion to plug the
deficit and meet the NT$66 billion in its debt repayments, according to Wu.</P>
      <P>The new budget plan calls for a special budget for infrastructure construction
projects aimed at stimulating the economy. That portion of the budget will be
the biggest expenditure, totalling NT$192.2 billion, up NT$43 billion from the
current fiscal year.</P>
      <P>Some NT$84.5 billion will be used for landslide and flood prevention and
control, up NT$9.6 billion from fiscal year 2009, with the aim of preventing
flood damage and disasters and safeguarding the life and property of the
country's people, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Also on the priority list are: strengthening anti-epidemic work, promoting
industrial and economic development, and establishing an efficient national
social safety net, Wu added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Losses in the agricultural sector from Typhoon Parma totaled NT$29.53 million,
with Yilan County in northeastern Taiwan suffering the heaviest damage, the
Cabinet- level Council of Agriculture (COA) reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Torrential rain brought by Typhoon Parma Sunday and Monday in eastern Taiwan's
Yilan and Hualien counties caused NT$11.43 million in damage to farms and local
agriculture, while related facilities sustained damage of NT$18.1 million,
according to the latest COA statistics.</P>
      <P>Some 80 percent of the high-end Sanhsing green shallot grown in Yilan was
destroyed in the flooding caused by the typhoon, a situation that is expected to
push up the price of the crop in retail markets.</P>
      <P>The Sanhsing farmer's association said that in 10 days time the output of
locally grown green shallot might be only half of the normal level. The COA
forecast that the production will return to normal in at least one month.</P>
      <P>Yilan's green shallot crops account for 15 percent of the total amount grown
nationwide.</P>
      <P>Although Typhoon Parma did not make landfall on Taiwan, its outer bands brought
as much as 1,500 mm of rainfall to Yilan, causing flooding in some 30 locations
and triggering mudslides in several townships.</P>
      <P>More than 800 residents in danger zones were evacuated between Sunday night and
Monday morning. There were sporadic reports of accidents in the area, but no
reports of deaths.</P>
      <P>As of Tuesday morning, the floods in most of the inundated townships had
receded. Across the country, traffic at 22 locations on highways and bridges was
either closed or suspended as a result of the typhoon.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, traffic on the Suhua Highway, which links Yilan and Hualien, remained
closed due to rockfalls and mudslides at six places along the road. The highway
is expected to be fully reopened by Wednesday.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday morning, the Northern Link Railway, which was damaged on Monday, was
repaired and two-way traffic had resumed.</P>
      <P>As Typhoon Parma moved away from Taiwan, the Central Weather Bureau lifted its
sea warning against the storm Tuesday afternoon, but warned that the south
eastern regions of the country and the Hengchun Peninsula on the southern tip
should expect torrential rain.</P>

      <P>Recent efforts by the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) to encourage overseas
businesses to be listed in Taiwan have borne fruit, with 29 overseas companies
having applied with the TWSE for guidance on how to do so, TWSE officials said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Since the start of this year, TWSE executives have visited China, Hong Kong and
various countries in Southeast Asia in a bid to persuade Taiwanese businesses
there to list their stocks on the TWSE.</P>
      <P>Most of the 29 companies that have expressed interest in doing so are Taiwanese
businesses based in China and Hong Kong, while U.S. hi-tech companies from
Silicon Valley form the second-largest group, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Among the Taiwanese businesses are the 85 C cafe chain, Tingyi Holding Corp.,
which owns the instant noodle brand Master Kong, IC designers Himax Technologies
and Silicon Motion Technology Corp., and monitor manufacturer TPV Technology,

      <P>The National Palace Museum (NPM) will continue to cooperate with Beijing's
Palace Museum, but will not loan its treasures to its Chinese counterpart, NPM
Director Chou Kung-shin said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to Chou, such loans do not fall into the category of cross-Taiwan
Strait cooperation.</P>
      <P>She made the remarks at a news conference to promote an exhibition of 246
artifacts from the period of the Qing Dynasty Emperor Yongzheng at the NPM
scheduled to open the following day and featuring artworks on loan from
Beijing's Palace Museum.</P>
      <P>Both Chou and Beijing's Palace Museum Director Zheng Xinmiao, who arrived in
Taiwan Monday for the exhibition, said the show will be the culmination of
cross-strait exchanges and cooperation over the past six months.</P>
      <P>Asked whether, since Beijing has loaned pieces to the NPM for the show, it will
in turn ask the NPM to loan parts of its collection to the Beijing museum, Zheng
said that "we are still discussing and planning the matter."</P>
      <P>Chou said that under a consensus reached between the two museums Feb. 15, they
have "put aside name designation and law in favor of substantive cooperation at
the present stage."</P>
      <P>"After deep and wide cultural exchanges, it will be only natural for further
exchanges and cooperation," she added.</P>
      <P>The cooperative and exchange programs announced by Zheng and Chou include the
establishment of a video conference system and linkage by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The two museums will also continue with cross-strait cooperation to work on
future exhibitions.</P>
      <P>Zheng noted that his museum will sponsor a seminar on the resumption of a Palace
Museum publication this November and will invite NPM Deputy Director Fung Ming-
chu to attend.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chou will be invited to attend an academic symposium sponsored by
Beijing's Palace Museum in October 2010, Zheng said.</P>
      <P>The museums will also discuss cooperation on developing cultural creative
products and combating copyright infringement problems, as well as new
cooperative projects and museum file exchanges.</P>
      <P>Chou made an ice-breaking visit to Beijing's Palace Museum in February -- the
first of its kind in 60 years -- and Zheng made a reciprocal visit to Taiwan in
March, during which matters regarding cross-strait cooperation on a joint
Yongzheng exhibition were discussed.</P>
      <P>Chou said earlier that Taiwan's legislation in 1992 of the Statute on
Encouraging and Rewarding Cultural and Art Enterprises had made the exhibition
possible.</P>
      <P>"Under the statute, exhibits from museums in Beijing and Shanghai are exempt
from seizure or any legal entanglement over ownership, " she said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's art and cultural objects could also be displayed in China once a
similar statute is put in place there to grant them the same protection," she
added.</P>
      <P>The Yongzheng exhibition, featuring the life, culture and art of his 13 years in
power from 1722 to 1735, will be held at the NPM from Oct. 7 through Jan. 10
next year.</P>
      <P>A total of 246 artworks related to Yongzheng, including 203 items from the NPM's
Qing Dynasty collection, 37 from Beijing, two from the Shanghai Museum, three
from Academia Sinica and one owned by a Taipei-based pharmaceutical company,
will be on show at the exhibition.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) vowed Tuesday to work even harder
than before to strengthen ties with the European Union, as the EU Parliament
will gain power and significance after the Lisbon Treaty takes effect.</P>
      <P>Prominent changes in EU structure and politics will take place once the treaty
comes into effect in January, as it aims to streamline decision-making and
reform the blocs structures.</P>
      <P>These changes include more qualified majority voting in the Council of Ministers
and increased involvement of the European Parliament in the legislative process.</P>
      <P>"The integration within the EU will march a step further when the Lisbon Treaty
takes effect, and we will have to put more value on the EU and strive to
strengthen bilateral relations with the European body and its member states,said
Chiu Jong-jen, director-general of the MOFAs Department of European Affairs, at
a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>According to Chiu, while Taiwan will continue to consolidate its friendship with
EU member states, the MOFA will also work harder to increase contacts within the
European Parliament.</P>
      <P>Doing so will help to broaden the Taiwan-friendly atmosphere in Europe, the MOFA
believes.</P>
      <P>The Lisbon Treaty will lead to the creation of a president of the European
Council with a term of two and half years and a High Representative for Foreign
Affairs to present a united position on EU policies.</P>
      <P>So far, the Czech Republic and Poland are the only two EU member countries yet
to ratify the treaty, which is expected to enter into force Jan. 1, 2010.</P>

      <P>The overseas holding company of Taiwan's top coffee chain 85 degree C Cafe is
planning to list the stock on the Taiwan market by the second quarter of 2010,
an official of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The 85 degree C Cafe chain, which is named after the ideal temperature at which
to brew coffee, will be the first Taiwanese coffee house to seek local stock
listing.</P>
      <P>The coffee chain is also expected to be selected by MOEA later this month as one
of the top Taiwan global brands in 2009, the official said, but declined to
provide further details on grounds that the company was planning to list on the
local market.</P>
      <P>In addition to its Taiwan business, the holding company Gourmet Master Co. has
expanded the coffee shop chain into China, Australia and the U.S., with total
revenue from business in the four countries reaching NT$3.4 billion in 2008 and
profits close to NT$500 million, the company reported.</P>
      <P>The chain, which sells a cup of house coffee at NT$35 (US$1.08), opened a new

    <HEADLINE>Tough talk from premier on illegal wiretapping by authorities</HEADLINE>

10/06/09  20:52:08
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih had some tough words on illegal wiretapping by law
enforcement officials Tuesday, saying that agency heads will be sacked if any
government official is found to have conducted illegal wiretapping in violation
of human rights protection principles.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks while fielding questions  from ruling Kuomintang Legislator
Lai Shyh-bao at a Legislative Yuan plenary session.</P>
      <P>Lai asked why two law enforcement agencies' 2009 budgets will only be slightly
less than their 2008 amounts even though the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) announced
recently that the number of wiretaps has declined by 70 percent.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, the 2009 budgets for the Investigation Bureau and the Criminal
Investigation Bureau under the Interior Ministry will only be 1.97 percent and
10 percent less than their 2008 figures, respectively, as listed in the central
government's budget plan.</P>
      <P>"It seems to me that the two agencies are still procuring wiretapping equipment,
" Lai said, adding that the premier should do something in this regard.</P>
      <P>He demanded that Wu make a commitment on eliminating unwarranted wiretapping by
law enforcement agencies.</P>
      <P>Under the existing law, Wu pointed out, wiretapping in criminal investigations
requires prior approval by judges.</P>
      <P>"Without judicial endorsement, no wiretapping is allowed. If any official dares
to conduct unauthorized wiretaps in violation of President  Ma Ying-jeou's
order  and human rights  protection principles, their superiors will be
dismissed," Wu said.</P>
      <P>"Like the members of the public, the government also hates illegal
eavesdropping," he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Minister of Justice Wang Ching-feng told Lai that the 2009 budget
plans for law enforcement agencies cannot be used as a gauge of the accuracy of
her announcement of a 70 percent decrease in the number of illegal wiretaps.</P>
      <P>"The 70 percent decrease was referring to comparison between the numbers of
warranted wiretaps recorded in 2008 and 2007. In the past, wiretapping just
needed the sanction of prosecutors, but the rules have changed and it now
requires the approval of judges, " Wang pointed out.</P>
      <P>She further noted that law enforcement officers who conduct illegal or
unsanctioned wiretaps will be subject to prison terms ranging between six months
and five years.</P>
      <P>Stressing that prosecutors offices around the country have conducted regular
checks on whether law enforcement officials have engaged in illegal
eavesdropping and provide up with quarterly reports for the ministry, Wang said
she will order a feasibility study on whether to set up a special hotline for
the public to report suspected illegal wiretaps.</P>

      <P>Thanks to strong showings in the global stock markets and on the local bourse,
three major government-run funds have registered profits over the past few
months, according to figures released Tuesday by various government agencies.</P>
      <P>As of Sept. 29, the net value of the retirement fund for public functionaries
had amounted to NT$422.9 billion (US$13.16 billion) , compared with NT$409.4
billion in 2007 and NT$349.5 billion in 2008, when the financial crisis began to
take hold, according to statistics compiled by the Management Board of the Civil
Service Pension Fund.</P>
      <P>Some 56 percent of the fund's total amount was used for fixed income
investments, down from 63 percent at the end of June. About 44 percent was used
for securities investments, up from 37 percent at the end of June, the
statistics reveal.</P>
      <P>As of the end of August, meanwhile, realized and unrealized gains from the civil
service pension fund had reached NT$51.26 billion, which translated into an
annual rate of return of 20.56 percent. The fund is expected to deliver even
more brilliant performance in September, as the local stock market rose by
around 10 percent for that month.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's labor pension fund, with a total capital scale of NT$908.6 billion, had
made a total of NT$75.98 billion as of the end of August, which translated into
an annual rate of return on investment of 8.88 percent, the fund's administrator
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The gains were sufficient to offset NT$60.5 billion in losses incurred last year
and netted NT$15.4 billion in surplus.</P>
      <P>Around 25 percent of the fund's total amount was used for equity portfolio
investments, according to the administrator.</P>
      <P>Since the second quarter of this year, the economies in the United States and
Europe have shown signs of bottoming out and local and foreign stock markets
have staged a strong rebound, leading to gains for the labor pension fund over
the past few months.</P>
      <P>The labor insurance fund, which suffered NT$50 billion in losses last year due
to the negative impact of the global financial crunch, also had made NT$28.8
billion in gains as of the end of August, according to the fund's manager.</P>
      <P>The gains were not yet enough to offset the significant losses of NT$50 billion
incurred last year, the manager added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>22nd swine flu death reported</HEADLINE>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A 42-year-old farmer from Cishan township in Kaohsiung County died Sunday from
influenza A(HIN1) , becoming the 22nd victim of the epidemic in Taiwan, the
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the Cabinet-level Department of Health
(DOH) reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The death was the first in Kaohsiung County out of a total of 25 confirmed cases
of the disease, according to the health bureau of the county in southern Taiwan.
Six of the patients remained hospitalized as of Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The man, who suffered from hypertension, diabetes and lung disease, died Oct. 4
at a Kaohsiung university hospital after his condition rapidly deteriorated
despite being given the anti-viral Tamiflu and placed on life support.</P>
      <P>He was admitted to the hospital Sept. 30 after developing fever and a cough --
typical symptoms of swine flu.</P>
      <P>The man lived with his parents, as well as the family of his older brother. His
brother was discharged from hospital Tuesday after being treated for a cold.</P>
      <P>The health bureau urged the public to stay on high alert against influenza
A(HIN1) as the peak seasonal flu period approaches.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a free inoculation program is slated to kick off next month to
encourage the public to get vaccinated against H1N1, according to Chou Chih-hau,
CDC deputy director-general.</P>
      <P>Chou said the DOH will offer NT$150 (US$4.63) per head in subsidies to local
health care institutions that offer the H1N1 vaccinations.</P>
      <P>"The amount is enough to pay for registration fees and medical examination fees
for each citizen who receives H1N1 inoculation at designated hospitals, clinics
or health centers," he noted.</P>
      <P>The priority list designated by the DOH for H1N1 vaccination is led by typhoon-
affected victims, medical personnel in charge of disease control and prevention,
and pregnant women.</P>
      <P>They are followed by pre-school children, seriously ill patients, elementary,
junior and senior high school students, individuals in the 19-24 age bracket and
those over 25 at high risk of cardiopulmonary disease, healthy people in the
25-49 age bracket, and those aged between 50 and 64.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday that a recent decision by
the British government to move visa applications in Taiwan to be processed in
Manila from Oct. 5 was made because the number of visa applications has
decreased significantly since March 3, when Taiwanese passport holders were
granted 6-month visa-free entry to the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>Chiu Jong-jen, director-general of the MOFA's Department of European Affairs,
made the remarks at a regular press briefing, saying that "the decision might
sound bad to us, but it is certainly not the case."</P>
      <P>The U.K.  Border Agency recently announced changes to the processing of visa
applications in Taiwan, saying that Taiwanese passport holders who still require
a U.K. visa will continue to make their applications in Taiwan in the usual way,
but from Oct. 5, the applications will be sent for processing at the agency's
new regional center in Manila, according to a recent press release from the
Taipei-based British Trade and Cultural Office (BTCO).</P>
      <P>"The change is to consolidate the U.K.'s immigration expertise in visa centers
of excellence such as Manila, to enhance the quality of decision-making. Visas
from Japan, Republic of Korea, and Hong Kong are already being processed in
Manila," the press release noted.</P>
      <P>Since March 3 this year, the U.K. has waived visa requirements for Taiwanese
passport holders traveling to the U.K. for less than six months, and from March
to July, the number of Taiwanese visitors to the U.K. was up by 30 percent
compared with same period of last year, according to statistics published by
Taiwan's Tourism Bureau.</P>
      <P>According to the BTCO, there will be no change in the visa application process
for people who still need a visa for the U.K. and no  additional costs will be
incurred, although there might be an increase in the turnaround time.</P>
      <P>"To ensure that travelers have a smooth trip to the U.K., we encourage everyone
to make their applications well in advance of any planned journey to the U.K.
Applications can be accepted up to three months in advance of the proposed date
of travel, " BTCO Director David Campbell was quoted as saying in the press
release.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Agencies with low rates of budget execution to be penalized</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  6 (CNA)
10/06/09  22:17:33

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan will unveil within one month a set of criteria for punishing
government agencies with low rates of execution of major infrastructure
construction projects that are part of an economic stimulus plan, Premier Wu
Den-yih said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the promise during a Legislative Yuan interpellation session after
ruling Kuomintang Legislator Lo Shu-lei suggested that the Executive Yuan
penalize public agencies failing to execute the special budget plan in a prompt
and efficient manner.</P>
      <P>Lo especially pointed finger at the Ministry of Economic Affairs, saying that 99
percent of the special construction projects with which it has been tasked have
not been executed.</P>
      <P>In response, Wu said that he will direct two Cabinet-level bodies -- the
Research, Development and Evaluation Commission and the Public Construction
Commission -- to step up supervision of progress in major infrastructure
construction projects and to work out criteria within one month for the
punishment of agencies with low rates of budget execution.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang rebutted Lo's
accusation, saying that his ministry was "not as slow" in carrying out budget
plans as Lo claimed.</P>
      <P>"The 99 percent rate was for June, when the special public construction budget
plan had been in force for just two months. By the end of September,  53.5
percent  of major  infrastructure construction projects under the charge of my
ministry had been implemented," Shih said.</P>
      <P>During the same legislative session,  opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) legislators grilled Wu about what they described as the government's
exaggeration of the economic benefits of closer engagement with China.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Yeh Yi-jin said China's imports increased 25.6 percent last year,
but its imports from Taiwan only rose 7.8 percent, indicating that the KMT
administration's eased trade and economic policy toward China has not generated
as many benefits as touted by the government.</P>
      <P>In response, Wu said trade should be based on reasonable and mutually beneficial
terms. "We cannot unilaterally ask China to procure our products, " he pointed
out, adding that Taiwan should endeavor to sharpen its competitive edge in order
to export more products to China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday that the government will make the best
preparations possible against future typhoons as if they were as devastating as
Morakot, which lashed Taiwan in early August.</P>
      <P>Morakot swept past Taiwan Aug. 7-9,  causing flooding and landslides unseen for
50 years, which killed nearly 700 people and left thousands homeless.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during a visit to the Central Emergency Operations Center
after sea warning for Typhoon Parma was lifted earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>He said that the center will continue to operate and provide necessary
assistance to local emergency centers before returning to situation normal.</P>
      <P>According to the center's estimate, one person died in flooding caused by Parma,
while 33 areas were inundated, with agricultural losses totaling NT$38.38
million (US$1.19 million).</P>
      <P>"The number of people evacuated was 7,863 this time, compared with around 6,400
evacuated from the affected areas during Typhoon Morakot," he noted.</P>
      <P>During Typhoon Parma, the number of people evacuated from heavy rainfall areas
of Taipei, Yilan and Hualien counties was 1,300.</P>
      <P>He said that this time, the number of people evacuated in non-flood areas was
five times those in flood areas, showing that residents were much more alert to
the potential for danger.</P>
      <P>Even before Parma hit Taiwan, relevant Cabinet officials visited different areas
of the country to communicate with local governments on evacuation, while the
military also deployed servicemen on standby in potential disaster areas.</P>
      <P>"The disaster prevention measures this time will be used for reference in
preparations against future typhoons," the president said.</P>
      <P>The government was harshly criticized for its slow response to Typhoon Morakot,
which led to the resignation of then-Premier Liu Chao-shiuan.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's academia was jubilant Tuesday over Academia Sinica Academician Charles
K. Kao's winning of the 2009 Nobel Prize in physics.</P>
      <P>Kao,  a Chinese American  who was awarded  the Nobel for breakthroughs in fiber
optics research, has been an academician at Academia Sinica -- Taiwan's most
prestigious research institution -- since 1992.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Chi-Huey Wong, who was attending a conference in
Japan, said in a telephone interview that he was very happy to learn that Kao
had won the top academic honor.</P>
      <P>The institution also issued a press statement expressing its gratification at
Kao's securing of the Nobel accolade.</P>
      <P>Kao,  75,  shares half of the US$1.4 million  prize "for ground-breaking
achievements concerning the transmission of light in fibers for optical
communication, " the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the prize,
said in a statement.</P>
      <P>The other half of the prize is shared between two other American scientists --
Willard S. Boyle and George E. Smith -- "for the invention of an imaging
semiconductor circuit -- the CCD sensor, " the Swedish academy said.</P>
      <P>According to Academia Sinica Vice President Liu Chao-han, Kao is one of the
pioneers of fiber optic communication.</P>
      <P>"His greatest contribution has been a discovery that led to a breakthrough in
fiber optics and facilitated the communications revolution," Liu said in the
Academia Sinica statement.</P>
      <P>"His calculation about how to transmit light over long distances via optical
glass fibers essentially taught us how electrical cables can be changed to
optical fibers for communication and was nothing less than a revolution. Even
now, most of the communications industry relies on fiber optics, " Liu said,
adding that Kao's discovery inspired the communications industry more than any
other.</P>
      <P>"When he was President of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, he cultivated
many talented young people. On behalf of the Academia Sinica I would like to
congratulate him heartily, " added Liu.</P>
      <P>Kao was born in Shanghai. He received his Bachelor of Science degree from the
University of London in 1957 and his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the
same university in 1965.</P>
      <P>He was President of The Chinese University of Hong Kong from 1987 to 1996 and
later served as director of engineering at Standard Telecommunication
Laboratories in Harlow in the U.K.</P>
      <P>While Kao used to travel to Taiwan to attend Academia Sinica's annual conference
after he was elected an academician in 1992, he has not visited for several
years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECCT to voice opposition to tax on investment-linked insurance</HEADLINE>

(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The European Chamber of Commerce Taipei (ECCT) will call on Vice Premier Eric
Liluan Chu to voice its opposition to Taiwan's decision to tax income from
investment- linked insurance products, an ECCT official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chris James, chairman of ECCT's insurance committee and president of Allianz
Insurance Taiwan, said at a press conference that it would be a mistake for
Taiwan's government to levy tax on income from investment-linked insurance
products,  as doing so will simply increase insurers' operating costs and impact
the public's confidence in long-term investment.</P>
      <P>As a result, he added, the government's tax revenue will not necessarily grow.</P>
      <P>Defending investment-linked insurance policies, James said that these kinds of
insurance products, which are transparent, flexible and offer higher returns,
can meet the needs of the insured in taking out insurance policies while giving
them the benefits of long-term investment and thus complementing the
shortcomings on the part of Taiwan's existing social security system.</P>
      <P>On July 24, the Tax Reform Committee under the Executive Yuan adopted a
resolution to treat earnings from unit- linked insurance products as taxable
income. Gains of up to NT$270,000 are tax-exempt under the existing exemption
for interest income, but amounts beyond that would be subject to taxation.</P>
      <P>The committee also suggested that proceeds from policies where the policy holder
and beneficiary are not the same person be subject to a 10 percent gift tax on
benefits of over NT$2.2 million.</P>
      <P>The proposal met immediate objections from both the American Chamber of Commerce
Taipei (AmCham) and the ECCT.</P>
      <P>The ECCT,  founded in 1988,  is the foremost organization championing the
business interests of European companies in Taiwan. It now has around 650
individuals and 370 firms from more than 25 industries as members.</P>

      <P>"The change is to consolidate the U.K.'s immigration expertise in visa centers
of excellence such as Manila, to enhance the quality of decision-making. Visas
from Japan, Republic of Korea, and Hong Kong are already being processed in
Manila," the press release noted.</P>
      <P>Since March 3 this year, the U.K. has waived visa requirements for Taiwanese
passport holders traveling to the U.K. for less than six months, and from March
to July, the number of Taiwanese visitors to the U.K. was up by 30 percent
compared with same period of last year, according to statistics published by
Taiwan's Tourism Bureau.</P>
      <P>According to the BTCO, there will be no change in the visa application process
for people who still need a visa for the U.K. and no  additional costs will be
incurred, although there might be an increase in the turnaround time.</P>
      <P>"To ensure that travelers have a smooth trip to the U.K., we encourage everyone
to make their applications well in advance of any planned journey to the U.K.
Applications can be accepted up to three months in advance of the proposed date
of travel, " BTCO Director David Campbell was quoted as saying in the press
release.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Agencies with low rates of budget execution to be penalized</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Executive Yuan will unveil within one month a set of criteria for punishing
government agencies with low rates of execution of major infrastructure
construction projects that are part of an economic stimulus plan, Premier Wu
Den-yih said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the promise during a Legislative Yuan interpellation session after
ruling Kuomintang Legislator Lo Shu-lei suggested that the Executive Yuan
penalize public agencies failing to execute the special budget plan in a prompt
and efficient manner.</P>
      <P>Lo especially pointed finger at the Ministry of Economic Affairs, saying that 99
percent of the special construction projects with which it has been tasked have
not been executed.</P>
      <P>In response, Wu said that he will direct two Cabinet-level bodies -- the
Research, Development and Evaluation Commission and the Public Construction
Commission -- to step up supervision of progress in major infrastructure
construction projects and to work out criteria within one month for the
punishment of agencies with low rates of budget execution.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang rebutted Lo's
accusation, saying that his ministry was "not as slow" in carrying out budget
plans as Lo claimed.</P>
      <P>"The 99 percent rate was for June, when the special public construction budget
plan had been in force for just two months. By the end of September,  53.5
percent  of major  infrastructure construction projects under the charge of my
ministry had been implemented," Shih said.</P>
      <P>During the same legislative session,  opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) legislators grilled Wu about what they described as the government's
exaggeration of the economic benefits of closer engagement with China.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Yeh Yi-jin said China's imports increased 25.6 percent last year,
but its imports from Taiwan only rose 7.8 percent, indicating that the KMT
administration's eased trade and economic policy toward China has not generated
as many benefits as touted by the government.</P>
      <P>In response, Wu said trade should be based on reasonable and mutually beneficial
terms. "We cannot unilaterally ask China to procure our products, " he pointed
out, adding that Taiwan should endeavor to sharpen its competitive edge in order
to export more products to China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday that the government will make the best
preparations possible against future typhoons as if they were as devastating as
Morakot, which lashed Taiwan in early August.</P>
      <P>Morakot swept past Taiwan Aug. 7-9,  causing flooding and landslides unseen for
50 years, which killed nearly 700 people and left thousands homeless.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during a visit to the Central Emergency Operations Center
after sea warning for Typhoon Parma was lifted earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>He said that the center will continue to operate and provide necessary
assistance to local emergency centers before returning to situation normal.</P>
      <P>According to the center's estimate, one person died in flooding caused by Parma,
while 33 areas were inundated, with agricultural losses totaling NT$38.38
million (US$1.19 million).</P>
      <P>"The number of people evacuated was 7,863 this time, compared with around 6,400
evacuated from the affected areas during Typhoon Morakot," he noted.</P>
      <P>During Typhoon Parma, the number of people evacuated from heavy rainfall areas
of Taipei, Yilan and Hualien counties was 1,300.</P>
      <P>He said that this time, the number of people evacuated in non-flood areas was
five times those in flood areas, showing that residents were much more alert to
the potential for danger.</P>
      <P>Even before Parma hit Taiwan, relevant Cabinet officials visited different areas
of the country to communicate with local governments on evacuation, while the
military also deployed servicemen on standby in potential disaster areas.</P>
      <P>"The disaster prevention measures this time will be used for reference in
preparations against future typhoons," the president said.</P>
      <P>The government was harshly criticized for its slow response to Typhoon Morakot,
which led to the resignation of then-Premier Liu Chao-shiuan.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's academia was jubilant Tuesday over Academia Sinica Academician Charles
K. Kao's winning of the 2009 Nobel Prize in physics.</P>
      <P>Kao,  a Chinese American  who was awarded  the Nobel for breakthroughs in fiber
optics research, has been an academician at Academia Sinica -- Taiwan's most
prestigious research institution -- since 1992.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Chi-Huey Wong, who was attending a conference in
Japan, said in a telephone interview that he was very happy to learn that Kao
had won the top academic honor.</P>
      <P>The institution also issued a press statement expressing its gratification at
Kao's securing of the Nobel accolade.</P>
      <P>Kao,  75,  shares half of the US$1.4 million  prize "for ground-breaking
achievements concerning the transmission of light in fibers for optical
communication, " the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the prize,
said in a statement.</P>
      <P>The other half of the prize is shared between two other American scientists --
Willard S. Boyle and George E. Smith -- "for the invention of an imaging
semiconductor circuit -- the CCD sensor, " the Swedish academy said.</P>
      <P>According to Academia Sinica Vice President Liu Chao-han, Kao is one of the
pioneers of fiber optic communication.</P>
      <P>"His greatest contribution has been a discovery that led to a breakthrough in
fiber optics and facilitated the communications revolution," Liu said in the
Academia Sinica statement.</P>
      <P>"His calculation about how to transmit light over long distances via optical
glass fibers essentially taught us how electrical cables can be changed to
optical fibers for communication and was nothing less than a revolution. Even
now, most of the communications industry relies on fiber optics, " Liu said,
adding that Kao's discovery inspired the communications industry more than any
other.</P>
      <P>"When he was President of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, he cultivated
many talented young people. On behalf of the Academia Sinica I would like to
congratulate him heartily, " added Liu.</P>
      <P>Kao was born in Shanghai. He received his Bachelor of Science degree from the
University of London in 1957 and his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the
same university in 1965.</P>
      <P>He was President of The Chinese University of Hong Kong from 1987 to 1996 and
later served as director of engineering at Standard Telecommunication
Laboratories in Harlow in the U.K.</P>

      <P>The European Chamber of Commerce Taipei (ECCT) will call on Vice Premier Eric
Liluan Chu to voice its opposition to Taiwan's decision to tax income from
investment- linked insurance products, an ECCT official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chris James, chairman of ECCT's insurance committee and president of Allianz
Insurance Taiwan, said at a press conference that it would be a mistake for
Taiwan's government to levy tax on income from investment-linked insurance
products,  as doing so will simply increase insurers' operating costs and impact
the public's confidence in long-term investment.</P>
      <P>As a result, he added, the government's tax revenue will not necessarily grow.</P>
      <P>Defending investment-linked insurance policies, James said that these kinds of
insurance products, which are transparent, flexible and offer higher returns,
can meet the needs of the insured in taking out insurance policies while giving
them the benefits of long-term investment and thus complementing the
shortcomings on the part of Taiwan's existing social security system.</P>
      <P>On July 24, the Tax Reform Committee under the Executive Yuan adopted a
resolution to treat earnings from unit- linked insurance products as taxable
income. Gains of up to NT$270,000 are tax-exempt under the existing exemption
for interest income, but amounts beyond that would be subject to taxation.</P>
      <P>The committee also suggested that proceeds from policies where the policy holder
and beneficiary are not the same person be subject to a 10 percent gift tax on
benefits of over NT$2.2 million.</P>
      <P>The proposal met immediate objections from both the American Chamber of Commerce
Taipei (AmCham) and the ECCT.</P>
      <P>The ECCT,  founded in 1988,  is the foremost organization championing the
business interests of European companies in Taiwan. It now has around 650
individuals and 370 firms from more than 25 industries as members.</P>

    <TEXT>Today is Wednesday, Oct. 7, or the 19th day of the eighth month of the Year of
the Ox according to the lunar calendar. Following is a list of important events
that have occurred on this date in the past:

1900: Heinrich Himmler, head of the Gestapo, and from 1929, Adolf Hitler's
second-in-command, is born.

1913: Henry Ford, the leading manufacturer of U.S. automobiles in early 1900's,
creates the world's first assembly line to build the model T cars.

1919: KLM, the national airline of the Netherlands and the world's first
airline, is established, and flights are scheduled to begin in 1920.

1949: East Germany, or the German Democratic Republic, is proclaimed, with
Wilhelm Pieck as president and Otto Grotewohl as prime minister.

1950: Communist Chinese troops enter Tibet.

1958: Communist Chinese begin to launch a mass movement in Tientsin to make iron
and steel, in which about 100 million people would eventually participate. The
movement, which proved to be a waste of both human and material resources,
resulted in the loss of 100 billion yuan in industrial production.

1959: Mario Lanza, U.S. tenor and film actor, dies at the age of 38. His films
included "The Great Caruso."

1961: Two Communist Chinese pilots, Shao Hsi-yen and Kao Yu-tsung, arrive in
Taipei from Seoul.

1974: A 90-member Japanese calligraphic mission led by Akira Koyama arrive in
Taipei for a six-day visit.

1976: U.S. President Gerald Ford, already under fire for pardoning the disgraced
Richard Nixon, tells the public on prime-time television that "there is no
Soviet domination of eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford
administration."

1982: Jimmy Wei, the national policy advisor to President Chiang Ching-kuo and
former president of the Central News Agency, dies of a heart attack at the age
of 77.

1986: President Chiang Ching-kuo tells Katherine Graham, head of the board of
the Washington Post and Newsweek, in an interview that the Republic of China
government will soon propose lifting martial law to actively promote democracy,
but adds that new political parties should abide by the ROC Constitution and
anti-Communist policy. He also emphasizes the ROC will never negotiate with the
Communist Chinese.

1990: The National Unification Council is established under the Office of the
President to help plan the policy framework for national unification and to
integrate various opinions on the issue at all levels of the society.

1998: Thousands of Russians take to the streets to protest against unpaid wages
and to call on President Boris Yeltsin to resign.

2000: Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan confirms that the Ministry of Justice's
Investigation Bureau will formally phase out its controversial "political
surveillance" work soon.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "It is only the man with the most perfect divine
moral nature who is able to combine in himself quickness of magnanimity,
generosity, benignity, and gentleness: qualities necessary for the exercise of
patience."</TEXT>

      <P>The Executive Yuan will unveil within one month a set of criteria for punishing
government agencies with low rates of execution of major infrastructure
construction projects that are part of an economic stimulus plan, Premier Wu
Den-yih said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the promise during a Legislative Yuan interpellation session after
ruling Kuomintang Legislator Lo Shu-lei suggested that the Executive Yuan
penalize public agencies failing to execute the special budget plan in a prompt

      <P>Lo especially pointed finger at the Ministry of Economic Affairs, saying that 99
percent of the special construction projects with which it has been tasked have
not been executed.</P>
      <P>In response, Wu said that he will direct two Cabinet-level bodies -- the

construction projects and to work out criteria within one month for the
punishment of agencies with low rates of budget execution.</P>

accusation, saying that his ministry was "not as slow" in carrying out budget
plans as Lo claimed.</P>
      <P>"The 99 percent rate was for June, when the special public construction budget
plan had been in force for just two months. By the end of September,  53.5
percent  of major  infrastructure construction projects under the charge of my
ministry had been implemented," Shih said.</P>
      <P>During the same legislative session,  opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) legislators grilled Wu about what they described as the government's
exaggeration of the economic benefits of closer engagement with China.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Yeh Yi-jin said China's imports increased 25.6 percent last year,
but its imports from Taiwan only rose 7.8 percent, indicating that the KMT
administration's eased trade and economic policy toward China has not generated
as many benefits as touted by the government.</P>
      <P>In response, Wu said trade should be based on reasonable and mutually beneficial
terms. "We cannot unilaterally ask China to procure our products, " he pointed
out, adding that Taiwan should endeavor to sharpen its competitive edge in order
to export more products to China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Shaolin disciple dreams up a kung fu school</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>By    Flor    Wang
10/07/09  10:37:05</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>CNA staff writer</P>
      <P>When Chang Ching-kuo dropped out of school and occasionally ran away from home
at the age of nine, his future looked bleak.</P>
      <P>Then, inspired by the films of Ashton Chen, a child kung fu star of the early
1990s, the Keelung native successfully begged his father to send him to the
Songshan Shaolin Temple Film and TV Kungfu Academy in China's Henan province.</P>
      <P>The move saved Chang's life, and now he harbors the dream of using martial arts
training to help troubled youths, just as the Shaolin academy helped him.</P>
      <P>"My biggest dream is to set up a nine-year martial arts school to help kids and
teenagers who have lost their way to lead normal lives and build up their moral
integrity," Chang says.</P>
      <P>The idea crosses the 27-year-old's mind every time he sees children or teenage
wasting their times in the streets or in Internet cafes.</P>
      <P>"Seeing this always makes me feel that a kung fu school would be good for
helping those kids get back on the right life path, " he says.</P>
      <P>"Learning martial arts such as kung fu is really tiring and requires single-
mindedness, but my personal experience is that kids like to spend some time
studying after completing their kung fu practice for the day."</P>
      <P>Chang speaks from experience. His parents were divorced when he was only two
years old, leaving his grandmother to look after him. But she was too old to
properly care for him, and he started running away from home and regularly
missing  classes after entering elementary school.</P>
      <P>"Every member of my family thought I was hopeless, " he recalls ruefully.</P>
      <P>In 1990, he entered the Songshan Shaolin Temple Film and TV Kungfu Academy -- an
umbrella facility authorized by the Chinese government to teach children basic
martial arts. There, Chang studied kung fu for five years.</P>
      <P>"Those days were beset with difficulties, and it took me several years to adapt
to the extremely  restrictive  and disciplined environment," he recalls.</P>
      <P>"Apart from getting only bland meals, we had to get up at 4: 50 a.m. every day
and start our training routine by running around the base of two nearby
mountains. With senior students chasing us with whips, we had to run faster than
rabbits," Chang says.</P>
      <P>The students were also subjected to physical discipline by older students when
their kung fu movements did not measure up.</P>
      <P>"Our thighs often bore bruises, " Chang remembers, and resting in the dormitory
often provided little respite from the daily hardships.</P>
      <P>"During the night, more than 20 people would sleep on a two-level bed in a
dormitory of about 100 square meters, " Chang says. "During the summer, we had
to endure temperatures of 40 degrees Celsius without air conditioners or fans,
while in the winter, we faced temperatures below zero while meditating."</P>
      <P>After five years of basic training at the academy, it was recommended that Chang
attend the Songshan Shaolin Temple Monks Training Base Mission in 1994 and he
became the first disciple from Taiwan of the Shaolin Temple at a time when
relations across the Taiwan Strait were still sensitive.</P>
      <P>He then was allowed to take part in a warrior monk group and performed around
China in the following years until he returned to Taiwan in 2000 to serve his
mandatory military service.</P>
      <P>That, however, marked the start of a fresh setback in his private life. With
just an elementary school education, he had trouble finding a well-paid job in
Taiwan despite his martial arts mastery and ended up working in odd jobs as a
construction worker, private security guard and waiter.</P>
      <P>Not until he appeared on a local TV show in 2007 did he achieve some level of
recognition, but even then, he was criticized for "fishing for fame."</P>
      <P>In the face of the mounting criticism, Hua Lin, secretary-general of the Taiwan
Zen Buddhist Association, came to Chang's defense, praising his martial arts
skills as a genuine accomplishment.</P>
      <P>"Chang's hard qigong, such as punching, flying kicks, swordplay, iron head and
weapon wielding, is really amazing and is evidence that Chang has mastered the
techniques of the so-called 18 types of Chinese martial arts," Hua said.</P>
      <P>The association now frequently invites Chang to teach Shaolin martial arts in
different regions of the country. He also returns to the Songshan Shaolin Temple
every year or two to perfect his techniques.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the years he spent mastering kung fu in China, Chang attributes
everything to destiny.</P>
      <P>"I do not regret all the years I spent learning kung fu in China, even if I
missed the chance to go to college in Taiwan, because it taught me to be a
righteous man."</P>
      <P>Passionate about contributing to society, Chang regularly shows his concern for
the underprivileged, visiting the Taichung Drug Abuse Treatment Center in
central Taiwan to help addicts with their rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>He also stages qigong performances for charity at nursery schools and
institutions for the mentally challenged.</P>
      <P>Establishing a kung fu school, though, remains Chang's major pursuit.</P>
      <P>"Learning kung fu can help kids achieve a healthy state, both mentally and
physically," he says. "As Abbot Shi Yan Zhang told me, a kung fu practitioner is
nothing without a strong sense of morals. The main tenet of kung fu is to
cultivate one's moral character."</P>
      <P>Hearing that the Miaoli County government  is planning to establish a kung fu
school next year, Chang wonders when his chance will come, acknowledging that
his goal remains no more than a distant dream hindered by stiff challenges.</P>
      <P>"Lacking support from the government or the private sector, it is a very
difficult task," he laments.</P>
      <P>Chang says, however, that he will not be deterred from his goal because  he
really  wants to do something  for troubled  and temperamental children.</P>
      <P>"My experience in Shaolin Temple made me aware that adults must find an
appropriate method to educate this kind of hyperactive child, who can easily
become a good for nothing by missing school or running away from home."</P>

    <HEADLINE>100 Chinese couples to get married in Taiwan by year-end</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 7 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>One hundred Chinese couples are expected to visit Taiwan by the end of this year
to get married and go on their honeymoon, an emerging trend in cross-Taiwan
Strait tourism, a travel agent said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The first group of 15 couples from Jiangsu province arrived in Taiwan Monday.
They were offered a mass wedding ceremony at the Taipei  101  skyscraper
Tuesday  before  setting  off  on an around-the-island honeymoon tour.</P>
      <P>According to Yao Yingjun, general manager of the VIP department of Jiangsu-based
China Travel Service, having their wedding overseas is becoming increasingly
popular among young Chinese, with the Indonesian  island resort of Bali and
Boracay  Island in the Philippines being the hottest picks.</P>
      <P>The wedding-honeymoon packages to Taiwan also appeal to Chinese couples because
more wedding traditions have been preserved in Taiwan than in China, Yao said.</P>
      <P>The fact that mass Taiwanese weddings are often witnessed by government
officials is also fascinating, he said.</P>
      <P>Couples taking part in the wedding-moneymoon packages can choose from two
themes: "trendy Taipei" and "romantic Kenting, " and they can also choose
whether to travel around Taiwan or just part of the island, Yao said.</P>
      <P>As such packages require a month of preparation, the next group of couples is
not expected to come until early November, he said.</P>
      <P>An around-the-island wedding-moneymoon  package costs 16,000 Chinese yuan, or
NT$77,000, per couple, including the costs of a wedding banquet, bridal gown and
wedding photo services.</P>
      <P>Zhu Jianfeng and Shen Jing, one of the couples who participated in the first
wedding-moneymoon tour to Taiwan, said they decided to join the tour because
they were attracted to the idea of having a wedding at Taipei 101 and thought
the price charged was very reasonable.</P>
      <P>Another couple,  Yuan Hui and Chen Qi,  said their first impressions of Taiwan
were passionate and romantic, and that getting married at the world's tallest
building was a very special experience that they will remember for the rest of
their lives.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to commemorate 60th anniversary of Kuningtou battle</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 7 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) will invite former Kinmen commanders and
veterans of the Battle of Kuningtou to a ceremony in Kinmen on Oct. 25 to
commemorate the battle that kept the outlying island out of the communists'
hands.</P>
      <P>As part of its campaign to mark the battle, the MND has also launched essay
competitions, art exhibitions, and seminars leading up to the main event, the
opening ceremony for the Peace Memorial Square on Oct. 25, Deputy Defense
Minister Huang Yi-bing said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Huang explained that the battle is being commemorated so that people will
remember historical lessons and create a peaceful environment for future
generations.</P>
      <P>The Battle of Kuningtou began on Oct. 25, 1949, when Chinese communist warships
carrying over 10,000 troops landed on Kuningtou, located on the northwestern tip
of the main island of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>After three days of battle, on Oct. 27, the nationalist army defeated the
communists after forcing the surrender of thousands of communist troops.</P>
      <P>The victory, which boosted the sagging morale of the nationalist forces, which
were on the retreat after losing the Chinese civil war, frustrated the communist
attempt to take control of Kinmen and its advance toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kinmen County Magistrate Li Zhu-Feng also suggested Wednesday that the MND
consider establishing a military museum in Kinmen to preserve discarded weapons,
an idea that the MND's Huang said the military would fully support.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 7  (CNA)
10/07/09  15:28:29
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials
Wednesday:</P>
      <P>UNITED DAILY NEWS:</P>
      <P>Should portrait of Deng Xiaoping hang on Tiananmen Square gate?</P>
      <P>As China marked its 60th founding anniversary, most worth celebrating was its
good fortune that the Communist Party of China (CPC) has been transformed from
Mao Zedong's communism to Deng Xiaoping's communism.</P>
      <P>After over 30 years of openness and reforms spearheaded by Deng, the present CPC
has in fact dismissed Mao, even though it still upholds Marxism and Maoism and
hangs Mao's portrait on the Tiananmen Square gate.</P>
      <P>That's because if Chinese leaders openly criticize Mao, the party's legitimacy
could be questioned. Yet though Mao's portrait still hangs in Tiananmen, China
is in practice moving away from and rejecting Mao's thought.</P>
      <P>There is a long way to go for China's transformation. The day the portrait of
Mao is removed from the gate, it may be the day when its transformation is
nearly complete. LIBERTY TIMES: People will not sit idly by as entertainers
ingratiate China and officials sell out Taiwan</P>
      <P>One entertainer said in his blog recently that China will definitely  become
powerful,  while  another  expressed  his congratulations on the birthday of the
great motherland.</P>
      <P>These entertainers, eying the potential market in China, are despicable because
of their ingratiating manners.</P>
      <P>But what's more abominable is the blatant tilt toward China by Taiwan's
political and business leaders.</P>
      <P>President  Ma Ying-jeou accepts the so-called  "one China" consensus to
denigrate Taiwan into a region under China. Even though he claims "no
unification, " he is following the approach of pursuing closer cross-strait
economic ties to promote unification.</P>
      <P>When China resorts to canceling the visits of Chinese tourists to Kaohsiung to
pressure it not to screen a documentary on a Tibetan political activist, Premier
Wu Den-yih was in league with China when he said "you want me to shop more in
your place, but you do things that make me uncomfortable, then I'd better not
shop there."</P>
      <P>These officials are abominable as well as horrible. President Ma is counting on
the sugar-coated drug of China for a better economy, which will lead to the
eventual swallowing of Taiwan by China.</P>
      <P>These political and business leaders who sell out Taiwan may lead a prosperous
life because their pay from China, but the future generations will suffer and
lead miserable lives. CHINA TIMES: Time to solve the overdue health insurance
payment problem</P>
      <P>Over the past six months, the pro-DPP media has doggedly pursued the issue of
the Taipei City government owing billions in back health insurance premiums.</P>
      <P>The reason, of course, is that the issue involves President Ma Ying-jeou from
his time as Taipei mayor. As mayor, Ma filed suit against making the overdue
payments and asked for a constitutional interpretation because he believed it
was unreasonable for Taipei to contribute to the premiums of those who worked
but did not reside in the city.</P>
      <P>Even though the administrative court and the grand justices ruled that the
Taipei City government should pay, this problem is still not solved.</P>
      <P>Local governments around Taiwan owe more than NT$60 billion in health insurance
premium payments.  The government has already borrowed over NT$90 billion from
the banks to tide over the health insurance system's difficulties, so the actual
book loss is only around NT$30 billion.</P>
      <P>If the Department of Health (DOH) wants to raise health insurance premiums
mainly because of financial shortfalls caused by the large sums owed by local
governments, then it will be hard to convince the public that health insurance
premiums have to be hiked.</P>
      <P>A total of nine cities and counties owe back health insurance premiums. The
biggest debtor is Taipei City, which owes approximately NT$36.7 billion,
followed by Kaohsiung City, which owes around NT$18.7 billion.</P>
      <P>At the same time that the government considers raising premiums, it must also
resolve the local government debt problem rather than focusing on the NT$30
billion deficit. But to solve the problem, President Ma must make his views on
the issue clear. Otherwise, nobody in the Cabinet will dare deal with Taipei's
debts. APPLE DAILY: (A) Bureau of Military Intelligence only good at internal
strife</P>
      <P>The bitter internal strife within the Bureau of Military Intelligence and its
involvement in corruption cases has led to indictments and personnel changes.</P>
      <P>The bureau is the most secretive  within the intelligence community and has
strong factions. In recent years, it has been infiltrated by China, seriously
debilitating its counter-intelligence capability.</P>
      <P>This, coupled with warmer cross-strait relations, has left the unit with nothing
to do but to engage in internal strife.</P>
      <P>It is worrisome because the unit is responsible for gathering military
information from the enemy. If it is demoralized, it will be at the mercy of the
enemy, damaging national interests. (B) A buck-passing government</P>
      <P>The fickle attitude of the Yilan County government has drawn the ire of its
residents, as the government changed its mind several times on whether or not to
close schools and offices because of Typhoon Parma.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih was right when he said that the matter should be left for
local governments to decide because it is more aware of the situation on the
frontline.</P>
      <P>During Typhoon Morakot, both the central and local governments were criticized.
That's why this time, the officials thought of only passing the buck to evade
their responsibility.</P>
      <P>This shows how blurred the lines of responsibility are and how weak-minded these
officials can be.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Bolder cross-strait investment policy to be put in place: official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Instead of a "bird cage" policy, the government will adopt a bolder cross-Taiwan
Strait investment policy to avoid Taiwan's marginalization in East Asia, in an
attempt to mitigate the effects of a regional trade bloc to be formed by China
and Southeast Asian countries in 2010, a government official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>San Gee, vice chairman of the Cabinet level Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) , outlined the government's stance concerning cross-strait
trade and economic links while giving a speech on Taiwan's challenges and
opportunities in an emerging Asia-Pacific market at the 2009 Taiwan Business
Alliance Conference being held Oct. 7-8 in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"The government is set to put forth more opening measures to allow greater
Chinese investment to enter Taiwan, " he said, without detailing a timetable.</P>
      <P>"To ward off the negative impact of an economic integration in the region on
Taiwan, which is excluded from the regional trade bloc, the government is poised
to adopt a more open and bolder cross-strait investment policy to help Taiwanese
companies secure their market shares in the Chinese market," San said.</P>
      <P>"Asian emerging economies, particularly China, will be markets full of business
opportunities in the future," he went on. "China has recovered rapidly after the
global economic crisis broke out a year ago, and is expected to have become the
world's largest economy by 2030, with a middle class population of about 44
million," he said.</P>
      <P>In the face of Taiwan's exclusion from regional trade blocs, the government
should seek to break the isolation through setting up cross- border partnerships
such as free trade agreements under the framework of the World Trade
Organization (WTO), he contended.</P>
      <P>"Cross-strait economic activities must be normalized so as to help Taiwan offset
its absence from regional trade organizations through two-way cooperation with
China," San added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Two newcomers make Taiwan's top 20 global brand name list</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two companies and their brands have vaulted into the Taiwan Top 20 Global Brand
list for the first time in 2009 with their high brand values and good business
prospects, the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The two new entries are Want Want Group, a food processing company from Taiwan
that operates over 100 factories in China, and CyberLink Corp., a multimedia
software company that produces DVD playback, digital home, television and
burning software, according to a TAITRA statement.</P>
      <P>Want Want, which had sales of US$1.55 billion in 2008, was selected because of
its dominance in the Chinese market, where 93 percent of its sales were
generated last year, the statement said.</P>
      <P>CyberLink was recognized for outperforming others because of the global momentum
of multimedia applications.</P>
      <P>The two firms were among 20 companies that have been selected in leading global
brand consultancy Interbrand's Taiwan Top 20 Global Brands survey for 2009.</P>
      <P>Other brand names making the list this year are, in alphabetical order, Acer,
Advantech, Asus, Depo, D-Link, Genius, Giant, HTC, Johnson, Master Kong, Maxxis,
Merida, MSI, Synnex, Transcend, Trend Micro, Uni-President and Zyxel.</P>
      <P>According to TAITRA figures, this year's top 20 brands in Taiwan are worth
US$8.67 billion, a 5.1 percent drop compared to the previous year, which
Interbrand said is because of the global economic crisis last year that caused
the value of the world's top 100 brands to fall by 4.6 percent.</P>
      <P>"Great visions and investment in technology innovations are reasons why these
companies create such impressive brand values, " Interbrand noted, but it
suggested that the brands explore markets other than the United States and China
to diversify risk.</P>
      <P>This is the seventh year that Interbrand has collaborated with TAITRA and
BusinessNext magazine to identify Taiwan's 20 most valuable brands by brand
value.</P>
      <P>To rank the brands, Interbrand uses a combination of analysts' projections,
company financial documents, and its own qualitative and quantitative analysis
to arrive at a net present value of the brands' earnings.</P>
      <P>The final ranking and brand values of this year's Taiwan Top 20 Global Brand
survey will be revealed Oct. 16 in Taipei.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Science parks' performance signals economic recovery: NSC</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan's economy seems to have bottomed out and is now in recovery, judging from
the sharp decline in the number of furloughed workers, increase in revenues, new
investment projects and increased water and electricity consumption at three
major science parks in the country over the past few months, the National
Science Council (NSC) reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The assessment was part of a report delivered by NSC Deputy Minister Chen Lih-
juann on the performance of the Hsinchu Science Park, Southern Taiwan Science
Park, and Central Taiwan Science Park for the period January to August this
year.</P>
      <P>The number of workers on unpaid leave at the three major science parks had
dropped sharply to 2,377 as of the end of September, down 98 percent compared to
the record high of about 130,000 in January, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>In January, employees on unpaid leave accounted for 66 percent of the total work
force at the three parks, but as of Sept. 30, the percentage was only 1.2, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, business turnover at the parks between January and August totaled
NT$930.3 billion (US$28.91 billion), which represented a monthly growth rate of
11.7 percent, he reported.</P>
      <P>In August alone, business turnover was NT$154 billion, about 94 percent of the
year-earlier level, he said.</P>
      <P>After the global financial crisis broke in September last year, turnover at the
parks dropped significantly, hitting a low of NT$71.9 billion in January, less
than half of the year-earlier level, according to figures compiled by the NSC.</P>
      <P>Monthly turnover at the parks in the first half of 2008 was around NT$160
billion to NT$170 billion, the statistics showed.</P>
      <P>Overall business turnover at the three parks is expected to rebound in September
to the level before the global financial crisis erupted, Chen predicted.</P>
      <P>The NSC also adjusted upward its forecast for business turnover at the three
parks this year to NT$1.59 trillion from the NT$1.41 trillion it had projected
in August.</P>
      <P>The total investment in new projects at the three parks during the first eight
months of this year was 96.6 percent of the amount for the same period last
year, while the capital increase in existing projects during the period was in
excess of last year's level, the tallies show.</P>
      <P>Between January and August this year, Chen said,  40 new investment projects
worth NT$41.45 billion were approved for the three parks, while 37 companies
increased their investment capital in existing projects by a total of NT$87.74
billion.</P>
      <P>In July and August,  20 newly approved  companies  became operational at the
three parks, while 17 companies increased their investment capital,  Chen
reported. The value of all the new investment and capital increase in existing
projects was NT$114.58 billion, 24 times the amount for January and February, he
added.</P>
      <P>In addition, in August, electricity and water usage at the parks increased by 26
percent and 63 percent, respectively, compared to January, Chen added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CDC to fund hospital costs for compulsorily isolated H1N1 patients</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 7 (CNA)
10/07/09  17:14:26
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) will foot the hospital bills of patients
who are compulsorily isolated with influenza A(H1N1) infection, an official said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to CDC Deputy Director-General Chou Jih-haw, the new flu strain is
categorized as a Category 4 notifiable disease, for which local health
authorities may decide at their discretion whether to enforce compulsory
isolation of infected patients.</P>
      <P>In the event that patients are isolated against their will, their hospital costs
will be funded by the CDC, Chou said.</P>
      <P>Chou made the explanation following a complaint by the Consumers' Foundation
that many hospitals require private room accommodation -- which is covered only
partially by the National Health Insurance -- for influenza A(H1N1) patients,
leaving the patients to foot the expensive bills themselves.</P>
      <P>The findings were obtained through a survey of 14 hospitals in Taipei City and
Taipei County conducted Sept. 21-23, according to Consumers' Foundation Chairman
Hsieh Tien-jen.</P>
      <P>The results show that five, or 35.7 percent, of the hospitals do not allow such
patients to stay in three- or four-bed wards, which are fully covered by
National Health Insurance.</P>
      <P>Among the five hospitals, Taipei City Hospital Yang Ming Branch, Chung Shan
Hospital and Wang Fang Hospital strictly require such patients to stay in
private rooms.</P>
      <P>While Chang Gung Memorial Hospital only allows swine flu patients to share a
three- or four-bed ward with other patients suffering from the same disease,
Cathay General Hospital requires patients to be separated from each other if
they are accommodated in three- or four-bed wards.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that eight, or 57 percent, of the hospitals will make the
patients pay for the cost of private accommodation.</P>
      <P>These hospitals are Taipei City Hospital Yang Ming Branch, National Taiwan
University Hospital, Cathay General Hospital, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Far
Eastern Memorial Hospital, Tri-Service General Hospital, Chung Shan Hospital and
Taiwan Adventist Hospital.</P>
      <P>To better prevent the spread of the disease, the foundation demanded that the
CDC make hospitals set up special isolation areas for swine flu patients and pay
for related costs.</P>
      <P>Also responding to the foundation's complaint, Tsai Shu-ling, manager of the
Medical Affairs Section under the Bureau of National Health Insurance, said the
bureau will launch an investigation into the situation.</P>
      <P>If any hospitals are found to have charged any compulsorily isolated patients,
they will be asked to provide refunds, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Statistics released that day by the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) show
that there were 11 more patients hospitalized with the H1N1 flu strain than a
day earlier, bringing to 332 the total number of such cases since the outbreak
began.</P>
      <P>While 26 of the patients remained in hospital, 284 had recovered and had been
discharged, and 22 others had died, the CECC said.</P>
      <P>As of 4 p.m. Tuesday, 351 classes in 252 schools around the country remained
suspended because of H1N1 infections among students. The number of affected
classes accounted for 0.23 percent of the total, according to the CECC.</P>

      <P>On the day before the first ever pre-season National Basketball Association
(NBA) game in Taiwan, Chauncey Billups, a point guard for the Denver Nuggets,
met with more than 300 fans at Taipei Gymnasium Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Billups, a three-time All Star, said in Chinese, "I support my team, " adding
that basketball is a team sport and everyone needs to play their part well.</P>
      <P>Billups said he is very honored to be part of the first team to play a pre-
season game in Taiwan, and promised to do his best in Thursday's game. The
Denver Nuggets will play the Indiana Pacers at 7:30 p.m. Thursday at Taipei
Arena.</P>
      <P>Several players from the local Super Basketball League (SBL) were also at
Wednesday's event, at which Billups gave young basketball players some tips on
how to move on the court.</P>
      <P>The NBA star also gave a demonstration of his shooting skills, winning a "three-
point shootout" against Lee Xue-lin, a point guard for Taiwan's Yu Long.</P>
      <P>During a practice session at noon on Thursday, Denver Nuggets forward Carmelo
Anthony said he is looking forward to seeing how crazy Taiwanese fans will get
at Thursday's game.</P>
      <P>The 4,000 available open tickets for the NBA pre-season game were sold out 15
minutes after they went on sale, despite the fact that the prices, ranging from
NT$800 (US$25) to NT$12,800, were the highest ever for any basketball game in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>After their game on Thursday, the Pacers and Nuggets will move on to China for
another pre-season game in Beijing on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Taipei is the eighth Asian city to host either an NBA regular season or pre-
season game, along with Tokyo, Yokohama, and Saitama in Japan; Beijing, Shanghai

      <P>The J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd. on Wednesday forecast a 5.5 percent growth for
Taiwan's economy next year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's 2010 gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to grow higher than that
of the United States' 3.2 percent and the European Union's 2.7 percent,
according to the forecast.</P>
      <P>Nick Lai, a research supervisor for the Taiwan area in J.P. Morgan Securities,
said that the Taiwanese stock market's return rate will reach 120 percent next
year, giving it the highest rate of return among all Asian markets.</P>
      <P>Lai predicted that almost all of the technology-related stocks in the Taiwan
market, with the exception of those of parts and components, will have better-
than- expected profits.</P>
      <P>He said that the rest of the shares listed in the Taiwan market will have a

      <P>Chinese tourist arrivals to Taiwan are expected to average 1,800 per day for the
whole of the eight-day National Day holiday of China that will end Oct. 8,
approximately 1.8 times the number that came last year, according to initial
tallies released Wednesday by the Tourism Bureau.</P>
      <P>However, representatives of local travel agencies noted that the number of
Chinese visitors has been on the decline in recent days as the long holiday
draws to an end, and is likely to fall below 1,000 per day after the holiday.</P>
      <P>Despite visits by Chinese tourists to various scenic spots around Taiwan during
the national holiday, the overall willingness of such tourists to visit Taiwan
could have been affected by the influenza A(H1N1) epidemic on the island, bureau
officials said.</P>
      <P>Fewer than 40,000 Chinese tourists visited Taiwan in September -- about 1,200 a
day, according to the travel agency representatives.</P>
      <P>During the first two days of China's National Day holiday this year, the number
of Chinese tourists to Taiwan hit a peak of about 3,000 a day. After the holiday
ends, however, arrivals are expected to dip to September's figure, or even fall
to below 1,000 a day, the representatives predicted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>National Basketball Association (NBA) players, who are currently visiting Taipei
for an exhibition game, on Wednesday coached Taiwanese children affected by
Typhoon Morakot to help them recover from psychological trauma.</P>
      <P>The participating children, aged 12-15, are from indigenous communities in
Chiayi county and other areas that have struggled against poverty or suffered
severe property losses during Typhoon Morakot, which devastated southern Taiwan
from Aug. 7-10, killing more than 600 people.</P>
      <P>The "basketball clinic" is part of the NBA Cares program that promotes social
responsibility and community charity.</P>
      <P>All of the children are sponsored by the Taiwan chapter of the Christian charity
organization World Vision. NBA Cares chose to work with World Vision Taiwan
because the two share a concern for children welfare.</P>
      <P>The charity and the NBA are hoping that through playing sports, the children can
begin to heal scars left behind by the trauma of the typhoon, including having
to flee their homes or losing their homes, family, friends and neighbors.</P>
      <P>"We always go through periods in life when we are down and everything has gone
bad, but you always can come back. There is always a brighter tomorrow," Indiana
Pacers star Danny Granger told the CNA.</P>
      <P>Granger believes that playing sports is definitely a good way to help with the
healing process for children who survived natural disasters.</P>
      <P>"When you play basketball or whether it's baseball, you are not thinking about
the problems that you're having at that given moment, so it definitely is an
outlet just by an event like this," he said.</P>
      <P>Describing himself and his teammates as big kids at heart, the 26-year-old NBA
star said that playing with the children was a lot of fun.</P>
      <P>Granger added that he is excited about sightseeing in Taipei during the visit
and said he has often heard that the NBA is popular in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Xiao Hau, a 15-year-old boy who participated in the basketball clinic, said that
he was really looking forward to the event because he is a fan of the NBA and he
plays for his school team.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will host an NBA game for the first time when the Denver Nuggets and
Indiana Pacers play an exhibition game at the Taipei Arena on Oct. 8, a
breakthrough for a country in which the NBA has a devoted following.</P>
      <P>Taipei will become the 8th Asian city to host an NBA exhibition or regular
season game. Japan's Tokyo, Yokohama and Saitama hosted six regular season two-
game series between 1990 and 2003, while exhibitions have been held in recent
years in Beijing, Guangzhou, Macau, and Shanghai.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier suggests amending laws on `fat cats'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>If regulations governing civil servant retirement and the retirement and
consolation payments for political appointee were to be amended, there would be
no possible way for retired civil servants to become "fat cats, " Premier Wu
Den-yih said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks while responding to lawmakers' questions at the Legislative
Yuan on the widely discussed matter of "political fat cats, " a term used to
describe retired government officials and military officers who are hired to
work in government-run companies or non-profit organizations.</P>
      <P>Thanks to these post-retirement jobs, some of those retirees are drawing two
salaries every month -- one from their previous post in the government and one
from their current job, while some also enjoy a high interest rate of 18 percent
on their bank deposits.</P>
      <P>The existance of "fat cats" has recently incured increased negative sentiment in
society, since many people have seen their incomes decline due to the economic
downturn.</P>
      <P>Wu said a clear law can deter retired public servants who are hired by
government-affiliated enterprises and organizations as advisors or chief
executive officers because of their abundant work experience and professional
knowledge.</P>
      <P>Under the existing regulations, the double salary payment is not allowed in
state-owned enterprises and non-profit organizations, but is permissible in
enterprises in which the government controls less than 50 percent of the shares.</P>
      <P>Wu revealed that two draft bills have been formed to lower the government share
ceiling to 20 percent, adding that they have been delivered to the Legislative
Yuan for screening.</P>
      <P>The controversy over "fat cats" arose last month after lawmakers accused the
management of the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) of allowing some
executives to suck financial resources from the company while leaving it with
heavy losses.</P>
      <P>Though operating the high speed railway as a private concern under a 35-year BOT
(build-operate-transfer) contract, THSRC appealed to the government for
financial support to help defray its losses, leading many to question the
compensation paid to its executives.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, a local tabloid newspaper pinpointed 236 "fat cats" who are
retired military officers. In response to the report, Minister of National
Defense Kao Hua-chu said that none of those who have retired from the ministry
are receiving two salaries.</P>
      <P>Not even those who are hired by the Veterans Affairs Commissions under the
Executive Yuan after their retirement receive a double salary, Kao said.</P>
      <P>Wu said the government has found in its probe that there are not so many "fat
cats" as the media have reported. "Many have been wronged, " he said, pledging
the government will deal with the issue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the legislative caucus of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) stated that it
will not rule out the possibility of cutting the budget for partially
government-owned institutions that "feed the fat cats with high payments."</P>
      <P>Legislator Lu Hsueh-chang, a whip of the KMT caucus, said at a news conference
at the Legislative Yuan that a resolution the legislature  passed early this
year rules that the government pensioners should not be offered a monthly wage
of over NT$31,200 (US$970) if they are hired by an institution in which the
government has at least a 20 percent stake.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet expressed reservations Wednesday over a request by hot spring resort
operators in Kaohsiung County for government compensation for losses from the
flooding caused by Typhoon Morakot in early August.</P>
      <P>Lo Shih-hsiung, chief secretary of the post-Typhoon Morakot Reconstruction
Committee under the Executive Yuan, said that any request for state compensation
can only be achieved through the court system.</P>
      <P>Lo also urged resort operators in the Baolai hot spring area in the county's
Liouguei township to reconsider their plans to rebuild their damaged facilities
on the original sites, pointing out that the increased probability of extreme
flooding as a result of global warming has made the area unsafe for development
projects.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau is expected to meet with the Council for Economic Planning
and Development and the Kaohsiung county government in the near future to
discuss whether to restrict development projects there or help them obtain
bailout loans from the government, Lo said.</P>
      <P>The official made the remarks during a meeting with the Baolai hot spring resort
operators, many of whom operate without business licenses and are seeking to be
legalized. They include the Hsin Pao Lai Hot Spring Resort, which suffered
losses of NT$670 million, and the Fun Chen Resort Hotel, which suffered losses
of NT$65.6 million due to the typhoon.</P>
      <P>Lin Kuo-bao, chairman of Hsin Pao Lai, argued that the operators should be
entitled to state compensation because the flooding that devastated the hot
spring areas could have been caused by improper work on a water channeling
project at the Tsengwen Reservoir.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu Chiu-lin, chairman of Fun Chen, said the unlicensed operators have
received government guidance for more than six years in preparation for their
legalization, and therefore should be made eligible for the government's post-
Morakot bailout program for the tourism sector.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Palace Museum will not acquire any disputed artifacts: curator</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Palace Museum (NPM) will not collect any cultural relics or objects
d'art whose origins are controversial or in dispute, the museum's top curator
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>NPM Director Chou Kung-shin made the remarks while fielding questions at a
Legislative Yuan session where ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lee Ching-hua
asked why the museum had rejected an offer by the French collector to give it
two bronze sculptures of Chinese zodiac animals that date back to China's Qing
Dynasty (1644-1911).</P>
      <P>Lee was referring to two bronze heads -- one of a rabbit and the other of rat --
that were illegally seized in 1860 from Beijing's summer palace Yuanmingyuan by
invading French and British forces.</P>
      <P>The two statues later became part of the collection of the late French fashion
designer Yves Saint Laurent. When they were put up for auction by the designer's
partner Pierre Berge late last year, it aroused great anger in China, which
demanded their return.</P>
      <P>China's Lost Cultural Relics Recovery Fund, an activist group, filed a petition
in France in an attempt to stop the auction, but the Paris tribunal rejected the
petition.</P>
      <P>The two zodiac animal heads were sold in the Paris auction in February this year
for 15.7 million euros each to a telephone buyer who at the time remained
anonymous. A few days later, a Chinese collector, Cai Mingchao, said that he was
the successful bidder but would refuse to pay for the statues. He claimed his
bid was a "patriotic act" to sabotage the auction.</P>
      <P>The two statues have since been sitting in a safe room at Christie's auction
house.</P>
      <P>According to a Reuters report, Berge had considered donating them to a museum
either in France or Taiwan. However, he said neither country wanted to
exacerbate tensions with China, and added that in the end he would probably find
a "brave" buyer.</P>
      <P>Responding to Lee's questioning, Chou said she was invited by the French
government to visit Paris in June. During the visit, she indeed met with Berge,
who said at the time that he "would neither sell nor donate" the two pieces, she
recalled.</P>
      <P>From the perspective of professional ethics, Chou said, the Palace Museum should
not collect any artworks or cultural relics whose origins are controversial or
in dispute.</P>
      <P>In response to Lee's continued grilling on the issue, Chou maintained that "as
they were taken illegally... we cannot accept them, because of professional
ethical principles."</P>
      <P>During the same session, opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Chen
Ting-fei asked Premier Wu Den-yih whether he agreed with Chou's views.</P>
      <P>In response, Wu said he will ask the Palace Museum to clarify whether the French
collector intends to sell or donate the bronze animal head to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Even if the collector wants to donate the items, we should still consider the
relevant ethical problems, including whether the Paris court's ruling is final,"
the premier added.</P>
      <P>The National Palace Museum in suburban Taipei is home to the cream of the
1,000-year Chinese art collection held by various Chinese emperors.</P>
      <P>Wu said all of the the museum's articles were legally transported to Taiwan
during the Chinese civil war. As the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have been
separately ruled for the past six decades, the National Palace Museum's legal
status is undisputable.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT legislative whip Lu Hsueh-chang said he agrees with Chou's stance
that it is not appropriate for the Palace Museum to accept the two bronze
pieces, which he said are more suitable for outdoor display.</P>
      <P>"The KMT legislative caucus would not oppose the idea if the French collector
donates the pieces to some other local museum for outdoor display," he added.</P>
      <P>According to the Reuters report, Berge has said he would return the two pieces
to China only if the country guaranteed human rights and allowed the exiled
Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, to return home.</P>

      <P>The Debenham Tie Leung Property Management (DTZ) on Wednesday said that it
foresees a 10 to 15 percent rise in real estate prices in the Taipei area in the
fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>Billy Yen, general manager of DTZ's Taiwan unit, one of the largest property
services companies in Taiwan, said that the prices of real estate in the Taipei
area can only move upward, thanks to the continuous decrease in the amount of
usable land and a possible mass inflow of capital from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Yen said that sales of the highest-priced office buildings registered negative
growth in the first two quarters, but sales began to grow in the third quarter.</P>
      <P>Yen said that Taiwan's real estate prices are lower than those of Hong Kong, and
under no circumstance would Taiwan's property prices remain at the current low
level.</P>
      <P>Regarding how people should cope with the market trend, Yen suggested: "Do not
sell your (real estate) easily, and buy whatever you like as long as prices are
reasonable."</P>
      <P>Taiwan on June 30 gazetted two sets of legal regulations with immediate effect
governing Chinese investments in Taiwan and applications by Chinese businesses
to open subsidiaries or branch offices here, paving the way for mainland capital
to enter the island.</P>
      <P>The move is widely regarded as being favorable to Taiwan's industries,
especially the real estate sector.</P>
      <P>However, people who cannot afford to buy a home - including many young Taiwanese
singles or married couples living at home with their parents or in-laws - fear
that an influx of Chinese investment in the sector could drive up prices to even
more unaffordable levels.</P>
      <P>Taipei's property prices, especially in centrally located areas, are already
considered beyond the reach of many working professionals , even with a
mortgage.</P>
      <P>Government efforts to encourage home buying by young people has only seen
minimal success.</P>

      <P>Ninety-nine diplomatic draftees are slated to head for Taiwan's diplomatic
allies around the world from late November  to  provide  voluntary  services,
according  to the government-funded Taiwan International Cooperation and
Development Fund (Taiwan ICDF).</P>
      <P>The draftees, divided into 27 technical and medical service missions, will be
dispatched to the country's diplomatic allies in Asia, Central and South
America, the Caribbean and Africa after completing an eight-week training
program in mid-November, said a press release issued Oct. 5 by the fund, which
is overseen by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>The young male adults, from a diverse variety of backgrounds ranging from the
high-tech sector to traditional businesses, will be performing their diplomatic
service as an alternative to mandatory military conscription.</P>
      <P>In line with international trends and in order to better serve the
underprivileged people in Taiwan's diplomatic partners, college graduates
majoring in financial management and industrial design have been recruited in
this year's program, the press release said.</P>
      <P>The program provides intensive training in foreign languages, cultural
differences and living skills to help the draftees quickly adapt to life in the
countries to which they are sent.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan ICDF started offering the overseas volunteer service by diplomatic
conscripts to its diplomatic allies in 2000, and this year's  diplomatic
draftees  are from more than 20 different educational backgrounds -- the biggest
range ever, it noted.</P>
      <P>To date, a total of 618 young males have participated in the program, gaining
practical experience in overseas volunteer work and opening a window on the
world for themselves, it added.</P>

      <P>A total of 23 artisans who have received permits from the Tainan County Cultural
Affairs Department to open street booths will launch their business at a job
fair Oct. 17</P>
      <P>The artisans first had to undergo three months of vocational training offered by
the Tainan County Labor Affairs Department, after which they took a licensing
test, which was required for the first time in the county and which they all
passed.</P>
      <P>The county government granted certificates of qualification to the 23 artisans,
which allows them to operate stalls on streets, in markets, or at government
sponsored fairs, said Chen Ya-feng, an official of the county's Labor Affairs
Department.</P>
      <P>They have already created a wide variety of innovative handicraft items such as
dolls made from children's socks and colored salt art works made from sea salt
from Cigu in Yunlin County, Chen added.</P>
      <P>The 23 artisans are now not only equipped with the skills to make art and craft
items, but have also been trained to attract customers and market their
products, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>The employment fair will be held at Nan Jeon Institute of Technology in the

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan, U.K. should strengthen partnership: British trade official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 7 (CNA)

(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Andrew Cahn, chief executive of the U.K. Trade and Investment (UKTI) -- a
British government organization responsible for marketing the U.K. overseas --
said Wednesday that Taiwan and the United Kingdom should work to build a closer
partnership, as it will bring mutual benefits for the two countries.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has enormous strength in consumer electronics, and Britain is
strong on creativity and design, Cahn said: "There is a natural marriage between
our two economies there and I would like to see us building on that link.</P>
      <P>Cahn made the remarks in a meeting with local media during his visit to Taiwan
to share the development of the creative industry in Britain over the past 50
years, and to promote business opportunities for Taiwanese companies in the 2012
London Olympics.</P>
      <P>According to Cahn, the UKTI is looking to partner with Taiwan because after
British companies helped Taiwan host the World Games in Kaohsiung in July and
Deaflympics in Taipei in September, the U.K. is hoping that in return, Taiwanese
companies will use the experience developed in holding these sporting events to
help London stage a very effective Games.</P>
      <P>More business opportunities will also be created for Taiwanese companies if
Taiwanese firms take part in the London Olympics, as the U.K. has close links
with places that are scheduled to host other big games, Cahn said.</P>
      <P>He was referring to South Africa, which will host the 2012 World Cup and Rio de
Janeiro, which was recently awarded the rights to host the 2016 Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>It isnt just one game, the skills which Taiwanese companies developed from the
games you held, you really can go out and sell, Cahn said.</P>
      <P>Also at the press conference Wednesday, Cahn announced the biggest single new
investment to the U.K. from Taiwan, with Kenmark Industrial -- a Taiwanese firm
that specializes in manufacturing liquid crystal display televisions -- having
set up a factory in Corby, East Midlands in the U.K.</P>
      <P>This investment is a great boost for the region and is very welcome. It comes at
a time when manufacturers have been struggling. This vote of confidence in the
U.K. and its manufacturing base will give people great confidence,Cahn said.</P>
      <P>Kenmark recognizes that the U.K. is the best place to establish a European
operation. We have a great business culture and we are the springboard from
which companies can move into markets around the world,he added.</P>
      <P>Kenmark Industrial has invested US$30 million and leased the 150,000 square-foot
facility for a LCD TV manufacturing plant, which has already started operating,
creating around 500 jobs over the next three years, according to the Taipei-
based British Trade and Cultural Office (BTCO).</P>
      <P>This new investment is one of the biggest investments to the U.K. from Asia in
recent years, the BTCO said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>September exports hit 11-month high</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's exports hit an 11-month high in September,  totaling US$19.07 billion,
according to statistics released by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Although the amount was 12.7 percent lower than the year-earlier level, the
decline rate was the smallest for the past 11 months, said Lin Li-chen, head of
the MOF's Department of Statistics.</P>
      <P>Lin predicted that the drop in exports will slow further this month and positive
growth will resume in November.</P>
      <P>"The export growth rate will pick up even more in December, " Lin forecast.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports began a steep downward streak in the fourth quarter of last
year amid a global financial crisis and economic recession, but they have been
spiking gradually since the beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>"As the fourth quarter is traditionally an export boom season, we believe that
the downward spiral of exports will soon bottom out, " Lin said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's external trade records for September also showed that its sales to
major trading partners have gradually rebounded. "For instance, our shipments to
China and Hong Kong posted the first positive growth after declining for 12
months," Lin noted.</P>
      <P>While optical equipment sales to China and Hong Kong posted the first increase
after a year-long slump, Lin said, the rate of decline for other major export
items to the two markets has slowed over the past month.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, imports of capital equipment and consumer goods have also been rising
steadily in recent months, indicating that private investment and consumption
have gradually regained momentum, Lin added.</P>
      <P>Compared with August, September's exports registered a marginal increase of 0.3
percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, imports for September amounted to US$16.52 billion, down 3.1 percent
from August and marking a 21.1 percent year-on-year decrease, which was the
smallest decline in 10 months.</P>
      <P>In September, Taiwan posted a trade surplus of US$2.55 billion, according to
customs statistics.</P>
      <P>Accumulated exports for the first nine months of this year amounted to US$143.82
billion, down 29.6 percent from the same period last year, while imports totaled
UD$121.78 billion, down 37.8 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>As a result, Taiwan enjoyed a combined trade surplus of US$22.04 billion for the
nine-month period, marking a growth of 1.5 times the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>In September, Taiwan's shipments to its major export markets, such as the United
States, Europe and Japan, all posted growth.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Most college students need part-time jobs to meet expenses: poll</HEADLINE>

      <P>The majority of college and university students in Taiwan want to find part-time
jobs to help defray living expenses, according to the results of a recent
survey.</P>
      <P>The results of the 1111 Job Bank survey, released Wednesday, showed that living
expenses for college students in the country average NT$64,000 (US$1,990) per
semester.</P>
      <P>Tuition and food costs are the major expenses, and 70 percent of students have
to come up with some of the funds themselves, according to the online poll that
was conducted Sept. 23-Oct. 6.</P>
      <P>Some 80 percent of the students said they need to earn money to meet their
expenses, and 92.52 percent said they would like find part-time jobs.</P>
      <P>Ho Chi-sheng, the executive in charge of public relations affairs at the online
employment consultant  company,  attributed  the increasing need for part-time
works among college students to tuition hikes, as well as salary cuts among
working people due to the global economic downturn.</P>
      <P>In addition, more and more students are choosing to remain in school longer to
pursue advanced degrees, which has contributed to the rising demand for part-
time jobs, Ho said.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 46.92 percent of the respondents needed to work so
that they can pay their student loans.</P>
      <P>Fubon Bank, a student loan provider in Taiwan, said it granted student loans to
57,000 people in the first half of the 2009 school year, marking a 6 percent
growth compared with the same period last year.</P>
      <P>The survey found that most students, 44.52 percent, lean towards part-time work
in the food service sector because there are plenty of offers and no special
vocational skills are required.</P>
      <P>The second most popular choice was office work, favored by 34.92 percent of the
respondents, followed by data entry, which was the choice of 25.79 percent of
the students.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,362 valid samples were collected for the survey, which had a margin
of error of plus or minus 2.7 percentage point.</P>

      <P>A delegation from the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) will visit China Oct.
18-24 to exchange views with judicial authorities there on cross-Taiwan Strait
cooperation in crime prevention, an SEF spokesman said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The group, to be led by Director of the SEF Legal Department Wu mei-hung, will
comprise 10-odd officials from the Judicial Yuan, the Coast Guard
Administration, the Bureau of Investigation under the Justice Ministry and the
Criminal Investigation Bureau under the Ministry of the Interior, said SEF
Deputy Secretary Ma Shao-chang.</P>
      <P>The group will visit the Supreme People's Procuratorate and the Supreme Court in
Beijing and the Zhejiang People's Procuratorate and Provincial Higher People's
Court in Hangzhou, to exchange views with judicial authorities there on ways and
means of enhancing cross-strait cooperation in fighting crime.</P>
      <P>The trip was postponed for nearly two months because of the Typhoon Morakot
disaster in southern Taiwan in early August and a subsequent visit to Taiwan by
the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama from Aug. 30-Sept. 4 to
comfort typhoon victims.</P>
      <P>Beijing, which sees the Dalai Lama as a separatist, had suspended several
scheduled cross-strait exchange programs in a show of displeasure over the Dalai
Lama's visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the governments of the two sides, SEF and its mainland counterpart,
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) signed an
agreement April 26 in Nanjing on cross-strait judicial assistance and
cooperation in fighting crime.</P>
      <P>The two sides agreed to help each other in serving judicial documents and
probing and collecting evidence, to confirm each other's  civil  judgments  and
arbitration  awards,  and most significantly, to repatriate criminals and
suspected criminals. The agreement was hailed as a milestone because China has
long been considered a haven for Taiwan criminals, mainly because of the absence
of a repatriation agreement.</P>
      <P>Ma also said that the SEF will go ahead with a plan to organize a delegation of
Taiwan media executives to visit China to help strengthen exchanges between
media enterprises on the two sides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Improving cross-strait ties will not affect relations with allies</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou reiterated Wednesday that his administration's efforts to
improve relations with China will by no means affect Taiwan's ties with its
diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while meeting with 18 senior military and police officers
from five diplomatic allies in Central and South America and the Caribbean --
the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Paraguay -- who
are attending advanced study courses in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president explained that his administration has been working hard to improve
relations with China over the past 17 months with specific goals in mind.</P>
      <P>"The main purpose of such efforts is to reduce tensions in the Taiwan Strait and
to seek the possibility of normalizing bilateral trade and economic relations, "
Ma said, adding that the drive will not affect Taiwan's long-term relationship
with its diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Ma said Taiwan is willing to discuss with its allies the feasibility
of extending  or expanding  various bilateral cooperative projects.</P>
      <P>Over the past decades, Taiwan has organized special classes for military
officers from its diplomatic allies. During the Cold War in the 1960s, it
sponsored training classes for grassroots military personnel for countries in
Latin America, Middle East and Africa for the anti-communist cause. Many of
those students later emerged as top leaders or prominent politicians in their
countries.</P>
      <P>In recent years, the courses have focused on topics related to political and
economic developments. Since the 1980s, Taiwan has also been hosting special
classes for senior military and law enforcement officers from its diplomatic
allies.</P>
      <P>Ma said that during his three state visits to Central and South America since
his inauguration in May 2008, he has met with many "graduates" of various
training classes organized by Taiwan in past years.</P>
      <P>"It was a special feeling to meet them in their home countries and I believe
that all those training classes have helped to forge significant friendships
between Taiwan and its diplomatic allies," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma said recently that in addition to training classes for military personnel
from diplomatic allies, Taiwan also plans to open classes for economic,
agricultural and health care personnel from its allies.</P>

      <P>A total of 23 artisans who have received permits from the Tainan County Cultural
Affairs Department to open street booths will launch their business at a job
fair Oct. 17</P>
      <P>The artisans first had to undergo three months of vocational training offered by
the Tainan County Labor Affairs Department, after which they took a licensing
test, which was required for the first time in the county and which they all
passed.</P>
      <P>The county government granted certificates of qualification to the 23 artisans,
which allows them to operate stalls on streets, in markets, or at government
sponsored fairs, said Chen Ya-feng, an official of the county's Labor Affairs
Department.</P>
      <P>They have already created a wide variety of innovative handicraft items such as
dolls made from children's socks and colored salt art works made from sea salt
from Cigu in Yunlin County, Chen added.</P>
      <P>The 23 artisans are now not only equipped with the skills to make art and craft
items, but have also been trained to attract customers and market their
products, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>The employment fair will be held at Nan Jeon Institute of Technology in the
southern county.</P>
      <P>Two other local governments, Taipei and Kaohsiung cities, have been
administering similar tests every year for the licensing of street artists
specializing in the performing arts, visual arts and creative artifacts.</P>
      <P>Licensed performers and artists are allowed to display their work or perform in

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan, U.K. should strengthen partnership: British trade official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 7 (CNA)
10/07/09  21:08:19
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Andrew Cahn, chief executive of the U.K. Trade and Investment (UKTI) -- a
British government organization responsible for marketing the U.K. overseas --
said Wednesday that Taiwan and the United Kingdom should work to build a closer
partnership, as it will bring mutual benefits for the two countries.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has enormous strength in consumer electronics, and Britain is
strong on creativity and design, Cahn said: "There is a natural marriage between
our two economies there and I would like to see us building on that link.</P>
      <P>Cahn made the remarks in a meeting with local media during his visit to Taiwan
to share the development of the creative industry in Britain over the past 50
years, and to promote business opportunities for Taiwanese companies in the 2012
London Olympics.</P>
      <P>According to Cahn, the UKTI is looking to partner with Taiwan because after
British companies helped Taiwan host the World Games in Kaohsiung in July and
Deaflympics in Taipei in September, the U.K. is hoping that in return, Taiwanese
companies will use the experience developed in holding these sporting events to
help London stage a very effective Games.</P>
      <P>More business opportunities will also be created for Taiwanese companies if
Taiwanese firms take part in the London Olympics, as the U.K. has close links
with places that are scheduled to host other big games, Cahn said.</P>
      <P>He was referring to South Africa, which will host the 2012 World Cup and Rio de
Janeiro, which was recently awarded the rights to host the 2016 Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>It isnt just one game, the skills which Taiwanese companies developed from the
games you held, you really can go out and sell, Cahn said.</P>
      <P>Also at the press conference Wednesday, Cahn announced the biggest single new
investment to the U.K. from Taiwan, with Kenmark Industrial -- a Taiwanese firm
that specializes in manufacturing liquid crystal display televisions -- having
set up a factory in Corby, East Midlands in the U.K.</P>
      <P>This investment is a great boost for the region and is very welcome. It comes at
a time when manufacturers have been struggling. This vote of confidence in the
U.K. and its manufacturing base will give people great confidence,Cahn said.</P>
      <P>Kenmark recognizes that the U.K. is the best place to establish a European
operation. We have a great business culture and we are the springboard from
which companies can move into markets around the world,he added.</P>
      <P>Kenmark Industrial has invested US$30 million and leased the 150,000 square-foot
facility for a LCD TV manufacturing plant, which has already started operating,
creating around 500 jobs over the next three years, according to the Taipei-
based British Trade and Cultural Office (BTCO).</P>
      <P>This new investment is one of the biggest investments to the U.K. from Asia in
recent years, the BTCO said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>September exports hit 11-month high</HEADLINE>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's exports hit an 11-month high in September,  totaling US$19.07 billion,
according to statistics released by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Although the amount was 12.7 percent lower than the year-earlier level, the
decline rate was the smallest for the past 11 months, said Lin Li-chen, head of
the MOF's Department of Statistics.</P>
      <P>Lin predicted that the drop in exports will slow further this month and positive
growth will resume in November.</P>
      <P>"The export growth rate will pick up even more in December, " Lin forecast.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports began a steep downward streak in the fourth quarter of last
year amid a global financial crisis and economic recession, but they have been
spiking gradually since the beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>"As the fourth quarter is traditionally an export boom season, we believe that
the downward spiral of exports will soon bottom out, " Lin said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's external trade records for September also showed that its sales to
major trading partners have gradually rebounded. "For instance, our shipments to
China and Hong Kong posted the first positive growth after declining for 12
months," Lin noted.</P>
      <P>While optical equipment sales to China and Hong Kong posted the first increase
after a year-long slump, Lin said, the rate of decline for other major export
items to the two markets has slowed over the past month.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, imports of capital equipment and consumer goods have also been rising
steadily in recent months, indicating that private investment and consumption
have gradually regained momentum, Lin added.</P>
      <P>Compared with August, September's exports registered a marginal increase of 0.3
percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, imports for September amounted to US$16.52 billion, down 3.1 percent
from August and marking a 21.1 percent year-on-year decrease, which was the
smallest decline in 10 months.</P>
      <P>In September, Taiwan posted a trade surplus of US$2.55 billion, according to
customs statistics.</P>
      <P>Accumulated exports for the first nine months of this year amounted to US$143.82
billion, down 29.6 percent from the same period last year, while imports totaled
UD$121.78 billion, down 37.8 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>As a result, Taiwan enjoyed a combined trade surplus of US$22.04 billion for the
nine-month period, marking a growth of 1.5 times the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>In September, Taiwan's shipments to its major export markets, such as the United
States, Europe and Japan, all posted growth.</P>

      <P>The majority of college and university students in Taiwan want to find part-time
jobs to help defray living expenses, according to the results of a recent
survey.</P>
      <P>The results of the 1111 Job Bank survey, released Wednesday, showed that living
expenses for college students in the country average NT$64,000 (US$1,990) per
semester.</P>
      <P>Tuition and food costs are the major expenses, and 70 percent of students have
to come up with some of the funds themselves, according to the online poll that
was conducted Sept. 23-Oct. 6.</P>
      <P>Some 80 percent of the students said they need to earn money to meet their
expenses, and 92.52 percent said they would like find part-time jobs.</P>
      <P>Ho Chi-sheng, the executive in charge of public relations affairs at the online
employment consultant  company,  attributed  the increasing need for part-time
works among college students to tuition hikes, as well as salary cuts among
working people due to the global economic downturn.</P>
      <P>In addition, more and more students are choosing to remain in school longer to
pursue advanced degrees, which has contributed to the rising demand for part-
time jobs, Ho said.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 46.92 percent of the respondents needed to work so
that they can pay their student loans.</P>
      <P>Fubon Bank, a student loan provider in Taiwan, said it granted student loans to
57,000 people in the first half of the 2009 school year, marking a 6 percent
growth compared with the same period last year.</P>
      <P>The survey found that most students, 44.52 percent, lean towards part-time work
in the food service sector because there are plenty of offers and no special
vocational skills are required.</P>
      <P>The second most popular choice was office work, favored by 34.92 percent of the
respondents, followed by data entry, which was the choice of 25.79 percent of
the students.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,362 valid samples were collected for the survey, which had a margin
of error of plus or minus 2.7 percentage point.</P>

      <P>A delegation from the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) will visit China Oct.
18-24 to exchange views with judicial authorities there on cross-Taiwan Strait
cooperation in crime prevention, an SEF spokesman said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The group, to be led by Director of the SEF Legal Department Wu mei-hung, will
comprise 10-odd officials from the Judicial Yuan, the Coast Guard
Administration, the Bureau of Investigation under the Justice Ministry and the
Criminal Investigation Bureau under the Ministry of the Interior, said SEF
Deputy Secretary Ma Shao-chang.</P>
      <P>The group will visit the Supreme People's Procuratorate and the Supreme Court in
Beijing and the Zhejiang People's Procuratorate and Provincial Higher People's
Court in Hangzhou, to exchange views with judicial authorities there on ways and
means of enhancing cross-strait cooperation in fighting crime.</P>
      <P>The trip was postponed for nearly two months because of the Typhoon Morakot
disaster in southern Taiwan in early August and a subsequent visit to Taiwan by
the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama from Aug. 30-Sept. 4 to
comfort typhoon victims.</P>
      <P>Beijing, which sees the Dalai Lama as a separatist, had suspended several
scheduled cross-strait exchange programs in a show of displeasure over the Dalai
Lama's visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the governments of the two sides, SEF and its mainland counterpart,
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) signed an
agreement April 26 in Nanjing on cross-strait judicial assistance and
cooperation in fighting crime.</P>
      <P>The two sides agreed to help each other in serving judicial documents and
probing and collecting evidence, to confirm each other's  civil  judgments  and
arbitration  awards,  and most significantly, to repatriate criminals and
suspected criminals. The agreement was hailed as a milestone because China has
long been considered a haven for Taiwan criminals, mainly because of the absence
of a repatriation agreement.</P>
      <P>Ma also said that the SEF will go ahead with a plan to organize a delegation of
Taiwan media executives to visit China to help strengthen exchanges between
media enterprises on the two sides.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou reiterated Wednesday that his administration's efforts to
improve relations with China will by no means affect Taiwan's ties with its
diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while meeting with 18 senior military and police officers
from five diplomatic allies in Central and South America and the Caribbean --
the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Paraguay -- who
are attending advanced study courses in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president explained that his administration has been working hard to improve
relations with China over the past 17 months with specific goals in mind.</P>
      <P>"The main purpose of such efforts is to reduce tensions in the Taiwan Strait and
to seek the possibility of normalizing bilateral trade and economic relations, "
Ma said, adding that the drive will not affect Taiwan's long-term relationship
with its diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Ma said Taiwan is willing to discuss with its allies the feasibility
of extending  or expanding  various bilateral cooperative projects.</P>
      <P>Over the past decades, Taiwan has organized special classes for military
officers from its diplomatic allies. During the Cold War in the 1960s, it
sponsored training classes for grassroots military personnel for countries in
Latin America, Middle East and Africa for the anti-communist cause. Many of
those students later emerged as top leaders or prominent politicians in their
countries.</P>
      <P>In recent years, the courses have focused on topics related to political and
economic developments. Since the 1980s, Taiwan has also been hosting special
classes for senior military and law enforcement officers from its diplomatic
allies.</P>
      <P>Ma said that during his three state visits to Central and South America since
his inauguration in May 2008, he has met with many "graduates" of various
training classes organized by Taiwan in past years.</P>
      <P>"It was a special feeling to meet them in their home countries and I believe
that all those training classes have helped to forge significant friendships
between Taiwan and its diplomatic allies," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma said recently that in addition to training classes for military personnel
from diplomatic allies, Taiwan also plans to open classes for economic,
agricultural and health care personnel from its allies.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's top school, National Taiwan University (NTU) , has made the top 100
list of the Times Higher Education--QS World University Rankings for 2009, with
a ranking of 95.</P>
      <P>It is the first time that NTU has been listed in QS' top 100 university rankings
since QS Intelligence Unit began to compile the list six years ago. NTU ranked
124 in 2008.</P>
      <P>The overall QS rankings were compiled based on six distinct indicators --
academic peer review, employer review, faculty student ratio, citations per
faculty, international faculty and international students.</P>
      <P>A total of 9,386 academics and 3,281 employers responded to the 2009 survey, an
increase of 40 percent in both groups from a year ago, QS researchers said.</P>
      <P>They attributed NTU's rise in the prestigious rankings to the fact that its
scores in most of the indicators improved this year.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the QS researchers suggested, if NTU and other leading
universities in Taiwan intend to stand higher in the rankings or enter the top
100 list, they should make improvements in areas like international faculty and
international students.</P>
      <P>NTU and other Taiwan universities could also do better in the areas of faculty
student ratio and citations, the researchers said.</P>
      <P>Sixteen Asian universities made the QS top 100 list for 2009, with Japan's
University of Tokyo ranking the highest at 22.</P>
      <P>Further down the list were the University of Hong Kong at 24, the Hong Kong
University of Science and Technology at 35, the Chinese University of Hong Kong
at 46, China's Qinghua University at 49, and Peking University at 52, according
to the QS rankings.</P>
      <P>Worldwide, Harvard University held the top ranking, followed by the University
of Cambridge, Yale University, University College London, Imperial College
London, the University of Oxford, the University of Chicago,  Princeton
University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the California
Institute of Technology, in that order.</P>

      <P>Mudslide risks will be taken into consideration when deciding whether to close
school and offices in the event of a natural disaster, the head of the Central
Personnel Administration said Thursday.</P>
      <P>City and county governments have the authority to announce school and office
closures if mudslide warnings are issued as part of disaster preparedness for
typhoons,  floods or earthquakes, Wu Tai-cheng  said during a question  and
answer session at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Wu said that in addition to wind strength, precipitation and earthquake
intensity, mudslide predictions will also be used by local governments to decide
whether to close schools and workplaces in the event of natural disasters.</P>
      <P>"Within the next two weeks, the government will put forth regulations for school
and office closures pertaining to mudslide risks," Wu promised.</P>
      <P>Such announcements should be made by local governments as early as 7 p.m. and no

    <TEXT>
      <P>Luxembourg's decision to open an official representative office in Taipei this
week is an indication of the value it places on relations with Taiwan, the head
of the office said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"This is a part of the overall strategic economic positioning of Luxembourg in
Asia, which includes setting up offices in Seoul, Shanghai, India, Dubai, Tokyo
and Taipei," Hugues Mignot, the executive director of the Luxembourg Trade and
Investment Office, Taipei, told CNA in a telephone interview.</P>
      <P>"Because of the improving relations at all levels with China, the world is even
more attracted to Taiwan than before, as it looks at Taiwan as a hub for
improving and developing additional relations with China," he added.</P>
      <P>Chiu Jong-jen, director-general of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' (MOFA's)
Department of European Affairs, told CNA that the Foreign Ministry welcomes the
establishment of the Luxembourg office, as it will help the Western European
country to gain a better understanding of Taiwan's economic and political
situation and boost bilateral exchanges.</P>
      <P>Luxembourg, one the founders of the European Union, was the 17th European entity
to open an office in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Mignot, the opening of the Luxembourg Trade and Investment Office
in Taipei follows a series of successful bilateral contacts between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>Mignot said there are already very strong economic links between the two sides
but Luxembourg  wants to develop new kinds of relationships with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said he will work to reinforce the substance of the existing relations in
such fields as air cargo, logistics, financial and investments funds management,
Web hosting, radio and TV satellite management and shipping registration.</P>
      <P>Taiwan  and Luxembourg  can also  cooperate  in areas  of high-technology such
as photovoltaic and healthcare research, he added.</P>
      <P>Mignot, a Belgian who has served as director of the Belgium Office in Taipei
over the past two decades, said that he was appointed to head the Luxembourg
office because of his experience. The appointment demonstrates the diversity and
openness of Luxembourg, which has three official languages and over 300,000
migrant workers from other European countries, he said.</P>
      <P>Mignots efforts to advance substantive bilateral relations between Taiwan and
Europe have been highly recognized and lauded.</P>
      <P>In 1987, Mignot was the first to propose the establishment of a European Chamber
of Commerce in Taiwan. In 2002, he started pushing for the establishment of a
European Economic and Trade Office in Taipei, which was finally established in
March 2003.</P>
      <P>Other efforts of his led to the signing of the Taiwan-Belgium Double Taxation
Avoidance Agreement. Furthermore, he has spared no effort in promoting
cooperation  agreements between the Taiwan External Trade Development Council
and National Science Council, and their Belgian counterparts.</P>
      <P>As the top Luxembourg representative to Taiwan, Mignot vowed to work on a treaty
between Taiwan and Luxembourg to avoid double taxation, and to promote academic
and cultural exchanges.</P>

      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) unveiled a plan Thursday to launch a dedicated
weather channel to provide the public with direct access to meteorological
information.</P>
      <P>The bureau is currently working on a joint project with Chunghwa Telecom in the
hope that the proposed free TV channel would be included in the company's
multimedia-on-demand (MOD) service, said CWB Director-General Shin Tzay-chyn.</P>
      <P>According to Shin, the CWB hopes to use the TV channel not only to provide
weather forecasts and information on earthquakes and typhoons, but also to
educate the public about natural phenomena in a fun and lively manner.</P>
      <P>However, it is unlikely that the channel will be launched soon, as the CWB's
existing workforce cannot yet produce enough programs to maintain the operation,
Shin said.</P>
      <P>As a warm-up to its TV venture, the CWB will strengthen its video cast service
on its official Web site, he said.</P>
      <P>The video cast will presented more frequently and it will be expanded to include
earthquake reports, in the addition to the weather forecasts that it currently
streams online, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chunghwa Telecom officials proposed that the CWB try to increase its
product variety to meet public demand.</P>
      <P>They said the company will hold further discussions with the CWB to hammer out
the details of the proposed cooperation project.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>"I would like to donate the proceeds from the auction to the Eden Social Welfare
Foundation as a tribute to the physically disabled," he said.</P>
      <P>"Little Henry was chosen among my many batons because it reflects many very
significant moments in my life and because the twice damaged baton signifies the
possibility that beautiful things, such as music, can be created out of
imperfection," he explained.</P>
      <P>The music career of the 39-year-old Chiang began long before he won the Georg
Solti competition. He started as a violinist, and by the age of 15 he was
already a chamber musician performing at the Munich Gasteig in Germany.</P>
      <P>In 1990, at the invitation of Professor Alice Schoenfeld, he attended the
University of Southern California (USC) where he met the man who would become
his mentor, Professor Daniel Lewis. Lewis encouraged him to develop his
potential to be an orchestra leader.</P>
      <P>As a college student, Chiang performed with the USC Chamber Orchestra, YMF Debut
Orchestra, Antelope Valley Symphony Orchestra, and Grand Teton Festival
Orchestra. He also had the opportunity to interact with several notable
teachers, including Gustav Meier, Robert Spano, John Nelson, Oliver Knussen, and
Seiji Osawas at Tanglewood in Massachusetts.</P>
      <P>Tanglewood has been the summer home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra since 1937
and the New England resort is considered a cradle of musical talent.</P>
      <P>Chiang, who became a Tanglewood fellow in 1995, had opportunities to pursue a
music career in the United States, but the young conductor had more ambitious
plans. His goal was to form an orchestra of Taiwanese musicians, take them to
see the world and let the world see them.</P>
      <P>In 1996, Chiang returned to Taiwan and soon grew busy teaching at Soochow
University and collaborating with ensembles on their productions. However, he
held on to his creed that "high art has a social responsibility to enlighten, to
reconcile, to challenge, and to entertain the souls and minds of the people of
its community."</P>
      <P>In 1998, he founded the Philharmonia Moment Musical, a symphony orchestra of
young Taiwanese musicians.</P>
      <P>"Unlike other genres, classical music allows a good performer to work alone in
his or her artistic pursuits, and consequently, musicians very often give the
impression that they are not keen on team work," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>"I believe all this can change if someone takes the lead and makes consistent
and continuous efforts to coordinate the progress," he added.</P>
      <P>The number of Taiwanese students at prominent music schools in Europe and the
United States is impressive, and many of these top students have returned to
Taiwan over the past two decades. In addition, classical music concerts have
been drawing increasingly larger audiences of all generations.</P>
      <P>Against  this backdrop,  Chiang,  as musical  director  of Philharmonia Moment
Musical, has been seeking greater international exposure for himself and the
orchestra.</P>
      <P>In 2003, he contacted Claudio Abbado, the music director and principal conductor
of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra,  London Symphony Orchestra and the Berlin
Philharmonic orchestra, hoping to audition for the summer music festival of the
Lucerne Festival Orchestra, which was founded by Abbado in 2003.</P>
      <P>A video audition of Chiang conducting an orchestra won him the valuable
opportunity to spend summer 2003 in Lucerne. In the next three years, he also
took some members of the Philharmonia Moment Musical to the festival in
Switzerland.</P>
      <P>In the last two years, Chiang and Philharmonia Moment Musical have made great
strides toward his goal of taking his orchestra to see the world and showing the
world the standard of classical music in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On June 19, 2007, Chiang made a highly acclaimed New York debut at Carnegie
Hall, conducting the New England Symphonic Ensemble in a program that featured
Beethoven and Mozart. In August 2007, he led his orchestra on a five-performance
tour of Italy and Germany.</P>
      <P>"The invitation to the prestigious Young Euro Classic Festival in Berlin in
August 2008 was a great honor for our 99-member orchestra," Chiang said. "We
impressed audiences there with our interpretation of Gustav Mahler's Symphony
No. 5 and with the Germany premiere of Taiwanese composer Lai Deh-ho's Concerto
for pipa, bamboo flute, xiao and chamber orchestra." The highly regarded German
newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine gave Chiang and the orchestra a good review,
saying it was no surprise that Mahler's Symphony No. 5 was performed in a Berlin
concert hall, but it was impressive to see a Taiwanese orchestra established in
1998 dare to perform such a symphony, which is traditionally dubbed "an ironclad
tank".</P>
      <P>Even as he strives to make his mark internationally, Chiang has set himself the
task of bringing music to local communities around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition to its performances at metropolitan concert halls, Philharmonia
Moment Musical has given open-air concerts at parks and schools and played
chamber music at reform schools and prisons.</P>
      <P>"After our performances in local communities, many of our musicians have said
that they found the interactive responses from people who had never sat in a
concert hall very rewarding, " Chiang said.</P>
      <P>The orchestra has given particular attention to aboriginal tribal communities,
holding dozens of concerts in remote areas of southern Taiwan prior to the
recent devastation that was wrought in those regions by floods and mudslides
from Typhoon Morakot in August.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the typhoon, Chiang said that he and his orchestra were
especially concerned about post-disaster rehabilitation in those remote regions.</P>
      <P>In an effort to help raise funds for typhoon victims in the affected
communities, the orchestra staged a charity concert at Huashan Culture Park in
Taipei on Sept 11.</P>
      <P>The orchestra has also scheduled performance tours of southern Taiwan with the
aim of brightening the lives of the people there.</P>
      <P>"The feedback we've had from ordinary people in rural communities has
invigorated our young musicians who are as convinced as I am that music can
enlighten, challenge and entertain souls and minds," Chiang said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang said Thursday that children
under the age of 9 and below third grade in elementary school will be given a
two-dose vaccine against influenza A(H1N1), better-known as swine flu.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level DOH will determine later whether the vaccine should be
administered in one or two doses to citizens over 9 years of age, the minister
said at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The DOH has purchased 15 million doses of A(H1N1) vaccine from the Swiss
pharmaceutical firm Novartis and from Taiwan's sole human vaccine manufacturer
Adimmune Corp.</P>
      <P>The minister said the H1N1 vaccine imported from Novartis will be available
earlier and will be more suitable for children, therefore, it will be given to
babies between 6 months and two year old, as well as to victims of Typhoon
Morakot.</P>
      <P>Medical personnel in charge of disease control and prevention will receive the
vaccine supplied by Adimmune Corp., he added.</P>
      <P>Yaung added it has been a global trend for children under 9 to be put on a two-
dose vaccination schedule, although effective single-dose vaccination in this
age group has been reported in clinical trials in the U.K. and Australia.</P>
      <P>The DOH has placed typhoon victims, medical personnel in charge of disease
control and prevention, and pregnant women at the top of its priority list for
H1N1 vaccination.</P>
      <P>Next on the list are pre-school children, seriously ill patients, elementary,
junior and senior high school students, individuals in the 19-24  age bracket
and those  over 25 at high risk of cardiopulmonary disease, healthy people in
the 25-49 age bracket, and people between 50 and 64 years old, in that order.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan higher education faculties underpaid: NTU</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's higher education faculties are generally underpaid as compared to their
counterparts in top notch universities in the world, a National Taiwan
University (NTU) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The relatively lower salaries offered to NTU faculty is one of the reasons why
the university has not been able to hire good teachers from abroad, NTU
Secretary-General Liao Hsien-hao said.</P>
      <P>"NTU should consider adjusting its salary structure so as to entice talented
professors from overseas," Liao said.</P>
      <P>He was speaking at a news conference to publicize a report from London earlier
in the day that NTU has made the top 100 list of the Times Higher Education-QS
World University Rankings for 2009, with a ranking of 95.</P>
      <P>It is the first time that NTU has been listed in QS' top 100 university rankings
since the global company began to compile the list in 2004. NTU ranked 124 in
2008.</P>
      <P>Noting that on average university faculty salaries in Taiwan are the lowest
among the four "Asian dragons," Liao said he is worried that even China will
surpass Taiwan soon in terms of recruiting top notch professors from abroad.</P>
      <P>"The salary issue has also led many outstanding Taiwanese professors to seek
employment in the wider academic marketplace, including the United States,
Canada and Singapore," Liao added.</P>
      <P>He praised a government initiative that was launched in 2006 to make available
"NT$50 billion in five years" to boost higher education in Taiwan, saying that
it has been validated by NTU's entry to the world's top 100 university rankings.</P>
      <P>However, the allocation this year of NT$7.5 billion instead of the originally
scheduled NT$10 billion under the plan has dealt a blow to the development of
higher education in the country, he said.</P>
      <P>The allocation for 2009 was reduced as a result of the global economic crunch,
the outbreak of A(H1N1) influenza, and the Typhoon Morakot disaster in August.</P>
      <P>Regarding new worries that NTU will lose its momentum now that it has entered
the top-100 rankings after years of effort, Liao said the ranking is not the
only index that NTU uses to assess itself, nor is it the only goal of the
university.</P>
      <P>"NTU's motto is 'duty, honor, country' and its top goals are to help students
develop good character and morals in their pursuit of knowledge, " he said.</P>
      <P>Commenting NTU's entry to the world top-100 university rankings, members of the
NTU Student Association said they feel honored, but must ask themselves whether
the achievement has any substantive meaning for them.</P>

      <P>Lee Chang Yung Chemical Industry Corp. (LCY) has been slapped with a fine of
NT$2 million (US$62,220) for unauthorized addition of a hazardous substance to
its bottled gas, the Bureau of Energy under the Ministry of Economic Affairs

      <P>LCY imports liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and also distributes LPG produced by

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will look into whether Taiwanese
nationals were treated unjustly when they applied for South African visas, and
decide whether to request changes, Foreign Minister Timothy C.T. Yang said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Yang made the remarks at the Legislative Yuans Foreign Affairs and National
Defense Committee in response to opposition Democratic Progressive Party
Legislator Tsai Huang-langs questions about how the ministry was dealing with
the problem involving Taiwanese passport holders, being treated like mainland
Chinese nationals, when they apply for South African visas.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese applicants have been required to present a certificate of account
balance showing they have savings of over NT$80,000 (US$2,490) and were given
visas which are only valid for 10 days, according to Tsai. This is the type of
treatment of Chinese nationals by many countries which fear they will overstay
their visit.</P>
      <P>This is indeed a matter of concern so the foreign ministry will look into it and
reason with the South African government,Yang said.</P>
      <P>Yang said his ministry will also carry out an overall review of how Taiwanese
nationals are treated when they travel abroad.</P>
      <P>"If there is any injustice or inconvenience, the ministry will request countries
concerned make improvements,Yang added.</P>
      <P>Making his first appearance at the Legislative Yuan after assuming office last
month, Yang told the committee that he will continue to promote President Ma
Ying-jeous policy of flexible diplomacy, which he said has achieved several
positive results, such as the admission of Taiwan as an observer in the World
Health Assembly for the first time this year.</P>
      <P>Yang acknowledged, however, that although such a policy has brought about many
opportunities and positive results for Taiwan, challenges remain in the future,
as it is difficult to make fundamental changes in international realities that
Taiwan has faced over the past decades.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Yang said that despite the fact that Taiwan and mainland China no
longer compete for allies under President Ma Ying-jeous policy of flexible
diplomacy, which favors a diplomatic truce with Beijing, the foreign ministry
will not take this arrangement for granted and let down its guard.</P>
      <P>Through active actions and concrete results, the Foreign Ministry will work hard
to prove that flexible diplomacy is the most accurate diplomatic strategy, and
that diplomatic truce is the most rational tactic for Taiwan to take,Yang said.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) has announced the winners of the
2009 Ten Best Classic Rice Award after a fair, just and open selection process
was conducted on Sept. 29, according to the COA.</P>
      <P>COA Vice Minister Huang Yu-tsai revealed the list of winners at the Agriculture
and Food Agency (AFA).</P>
      <P>The 10 winners are: Hsu Neng-fa, Chen Lung-an, Tseng Chung-nung, Chang Mao-
sheng, Tsai Sheng-ping, Chuang Yu-chih, Cheng Shu-lin, Wu Tsung-wen, Tseng Ming-
pao and Wu Chang-cheng .</P>
      <P>Since 2004, the COA has been conducting the annual "National Quality Rice
Competition" to select the best brands of rice in Taiwan. In an effort to
attract more outstanding farmers to join the competition, the contest was
renamed the Ten Classic Rice Award in 2007.</P>
      <P>This year, the seventh annual competition has 1,493 participants from 47
townships and cities, the highest numbers ever. The competition itself has
become the common interests of the rice industry.</P>
      <P>The COA stressed that the event has succeeded in introducing the idea of high-
quality production to farmers, recognizing the hard work farmers have done, and
increasing farmers' revenues. In addition, it helps to promote the popularity of
the rice-producing areas and boost local development.</P>
      <P>The Council will grant the 2009 Ten Classic Rice Awards to the 10 winners at the
Taipei World Trade Center Hall 2 on Oct. 17. In the meantime, the High-Quality

      <P>Foreign Minister Timothy C.T. Yang on Thursday expressed confidence in Taiwan's
efforts to seek meaningful participation in two United Nations specialized
agencies, saying that he believes it will not take as long as it did to gain
observer status in the World Health Assembly (WHA).</P>
      <P>Taiwan will seek meaningful participation in the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO), according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>"After 13 years of effort, Taiwan was finally admitted to the WHA as an observer
in May, " Yang said. "I believe we can do it much faster in the case of these
two agencies, but I cannot project a timetable."</P>
      <P>Yang made the remarks in response to legislators' questions on the issue, while
reporting to the Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs and National Defense
Committee for the first time since he took office last month.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) announced Sept. 21 that Taiwan will
strive for membership in U.N. specialized agencies, rather than direct
participation in the U.N. as it had been pursuing in previous years.</P>
      <P>The ministry called for the UNFCCC and the ICAO to give favorable consideration
to the needs of the Taiwan people and what they could contribute if admitted.</P>
      <P>Paul Chang, director-general of the MOFA's Department of International
Organizations, said at Thursday's committee meeting that as of Wednesday, 14 of
Taiwan's 23 diplomatic allies had co-signed a resolution in support of Taiwan's
bid to participate in the UNFCC, while 13 of them had expressed support in the
case of the ICAO.</P>
      <P>Opposition  Democratic  Progressive  Party  Legislator  Tsai Huang-lang raised
the issue of Taiwan's designation in its efforts to join the agencies, noting
that some U.N.-related Web sites still refer to Taiwan as "Taipei, China, " a
name that he said is unacceptable and belittles the country.</P>
      <P>Yang said that although Taiwan is seeking pragmatic participation in the U.N.
specialized agencies, the MOFA will try to come up with a designation that would
uphold Taiwan's dignity.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has not been represented in the U.N. since 1971, when the Republic of
China's seat was given to the Peoples Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Since 1993, it has been trying to have the world body consider the issue of its
representation, but has made little progress largely due to China's obstruction.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's allies and supporters have been trying to get the General Assembly to
list Taiwan's application for admission on the U.N. agenda, but Beijing's claim
that Taiwan is part of China has prevailed.</P>
      <P>This year, Taiwan has come up with a more flexible and pragmatic approach that
it hopes will allow it to better negotiate the complex situation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, on the question of who will represent Taiwan at this year's
unofficial leaders summit of the Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation forum Nov.
12-14 in Singapore, Yang said that he cannot comment on the issue, as the
arrangements with leaders of other countries are still in progress.</P>
      <P>Because of Beijing's opposition, presidents of the Republic of China have been
barred from APEC unofficial leadership summits since the country became a member
of the regional grouping in 1991 under the name "Chinese Taipei."</P>
      <P>As cross-strait relations began to thaw after President Ma Ying-jeou took office
in May 2008, China did not oppose his choice of former Vice President Lien Chan
to represent Taiwan at the APEC summit in Peru last year.</P>
      <P>Lien was the most senior former Taiwanese official to ever stand in for the
country's president at an APEC summit.</P>

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials
Thursday:</P>
      <P>Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>Charles Kao became the ninth ethnic Chinese to have ever won the Nobel Prize.</P>
      <P>This raises a question: whether he or the eight others would ever have won the
laureate if they had stayed in China or Taiwan. The answer is astoundingly no.</P>
      <P>This is not only because of their less developed scientific levels and fewer
research communities, but also because of too much political meddling. Gao
Xingjian who was exiled into France after winning the laureate is a notable
example.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, Chinese are so much longing for this honor that they seem to
consider Nobel the only measurement of value.</P>
      <P>We are glad that Kao won the laureate, a fact that proves that Chinese are not
inferior to other people, but we should not be obsessed with winning it. A
watched pot never boils. Chinese will have a better chance to get the honor if
they devote themselves to their work and forget about winning the prize.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Testing ECFA with China on China's west of Strait special economic district.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is seeking to conclude an economic cooperation framework agreement with
China.</P>
      <P>It has claimed however that the agreement will be separated from China's west of
Strait special economic district in the provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, and
Zhejiang and Jiangxi.</P>
      <P>However, we would like to suggest the authorities test ECFA on this district
because it would give Taiwan the opportunity to mitigate the impacts of opening
itself to the whole China abruptly.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the west of Strait district is less developed compared to central
China, and opening Taiwan to it will not seriously harm Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>China and Taiwan, who is whose automatic teller machine ?</P>
      <P>When a lawmaker questioned the government's policy of opening Taiwan to Chinese
investment, citing that only a few Chinese have invested in Taiwan, Premier Wu
Den-yih said Taiwan has to improve its competitiveness to attract Chinese
investment rather than consider China as its automatic teller machine.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China are competing against each other for overseas markets, they
could hardly cooperate with each other without undermining their own benefits,
and President Ma Ying-jeou's policy of seeking closer economic ties with China
is giving China a chance to learn Taiwan's skills to compete against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Instead of realizing that President Ma has made Taiwan China's automatic teller
machine, Premier Wu Den-yih warned the lawmakers against esteeming China as the
island's automatic teller machine. How can this person make sensible economic
decisions for the country?</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Two parties have come full circle</P>
      <P>One and a half years after it won three fourths of the legislative seats, the
Kuomintang is faced with a situation of internal divisions caused by local
factions. The reason for the splits is that the local factions have sensed the
unpopularity of the KMT central government brought about by its poor
performance.</P>
      <P>The KMT's loss in the legislative by-election in Yunlin is evidence of the
party's sliding popularity. In the election, a former ally ran against the KMT
candidate in the race, but they received far fewer combined votes than the
winning Democratic Progressive Party candidate.</P>
      <P>Is the DPP's victory in Yunlin an isolated incident or an indication of a shift
away from the KMT?</P>
      <P>Even Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, is not sure that her party will win
resoundingly in the year-end elections for magistrates and mayors.</P>
      <P>If the opposition party wins the magistracy in Yilan and Nantou counties as
expected, it would only be recovering political turf that it lost in 2005.</P>
      <P>It means that the two parties have come full circle and they should know that
what really counts is their policy and their performance in office.</P>

      <P>Outgoing chairman of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), Wu Poh-hsiung, will host a

the post, according to a KMT source.</P>
      <P>Lee Chien-jung, director of the KMT Cultural and Communications Affairs

Fullon Hotel Taipei.</P>
      <P>The invited guests include KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan, Premier Wu Den-yih

other KMT vice chairmen and heads of various KMT committees and departments.</P>
      <P>The premier's office could not confirm whether he would make it back to Taipei
in time for the dinner, as he is on an inspection tour of flood-affected areas
in the northeastern county of Yilan in the wake of Typhoon Parma.</P>
      <P>Wu Poh-hsiung will be replaced as KMT chairman by President Ma Ying-jeou on Oct.
17, following Ma's unopposed election to the post July 26.</P>
      <P>Wu Poh-hsiung assumed chairmanship of the party on April 11, 2007 after a

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der said Thursday that the level of public
borrowing and government debt as a ratio of gross domestic product (GDP) will
gradually decline in the coming years in line with a mandatory debt-repayment
mechanism.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks while attending a legislative committee hearing on the
allocation of a special budget on post-Typhoon Morakot reconstruction work for
the period from 2009-2012.</P>
      <P>He was responding to questions from ruling Kuomintang Legislator Sun Ta-chien.</P>
      <P>Sun voiced grave concerns over the government finances, noting that it was
estimated government debt would hit around 37 percent of GDP by the end of 2010
-- nearing the highest level allowed by law.</P>
      <P>Sun questioned Lee on whether the government has worked out any measures to
improve its financial situation and repay its snowballing debt.</P>
      <P>Although Lee stressed that drastic measures are necessary at a drastic time to
address thorny issues, the minister, however, said government borrowing is not
necessarily bad if it is used to boost national development.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with a middle- and long-term debt repaying project, Lee said that
government borrowing will be reduced every year from 2016. Its level as a
percentage of GDP will also slide in tandem, he said.</P>
      <P>Officials of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) said late last month that government debt was estimated to account for
40.1 percent of the country's GDP for fiscal year 2009, up from 35.5 percent in
2008, and 34 percent in 2007.</P>
      <P>The debt growth is attributable to the damage in infrastructure caused by
several typhoons -- including Typhoon Morakot, which caused widespread
destruction in early August -- and the global economic downturn, CEPD officials
said.</P>
      <P>They said that although the ratio is much lower than the average of 91.6 percent
among member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) , the government should not underestimate the situation,
because the government has posted a fiscal deficit for three consecutive years.</P>
      <P>The deficit for fiscal 2009 is equivalent to 4 percent of GDP, up from 0.9
percent in 2008 and 0.4 percent in 2007, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the latest Finance Ministry statistics showed that the central
government's outstanding debt totaled NT$3.887 trillion (US$120.3 billion) as of
the end of August.</P>
      <P>After President Ma Ying-jeou was inaugurated 16 months ago, the government has
borrowed NT$222.5 billion to finance stimulus measures to boost economic growth
due to the global financial crisis, the ministry added.</P>

      <P>The Supreme Court on Thursday instructed a lower court to reconsider its ruling
that former President Chen Shui-bian should be held in custody for another three
months, a Supreme Court spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Both Chen and his wife Wu Shu-jen were sentenced Sept. 11 to life in prison and
fined NT$200 million (US$6.13 million) and NT$300 million, respectively, on
several counts of corruption, including embezzling from a presidential fund for
state affairs, taking bribes from local businessmen and money laundering.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court panel took charge of Chen's case on Sept. 24 after he
appealed the judgment, and it ruled later that day that Chen should remain in
custody for another three months. It citied the reasons that "there is evidence
showing that Chen has tried to hide his ill-gotten gains abroad and, as a former
president, he is more familiar with ways to flee than ordinary people, and thus
the possibility exists that he would do so. "</P>
      <P>However, the Supreme Court said that the High Court ruling cannot stand because
it "failed to clearly identify the facts that it cited as evidence to support
Chen's continued detention."</P>
      <P>On Sept. 25, Chen appealed to the Supreme Court against the High Court's ruling
on his continued detention.</P>
      <P>The former president was first detained Nov. 12 last year and was released Dec.
13 following his indictment on charges of embezzlement, corruption and money
laundering.</P>
      <P>He was detained again Dec. 30 after the Taipei District Court approved a request
by prosecutors to take him back into custody and he has not been released since.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan proposes bill to restrict land use following Typhoon Morakot</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Cabinet approved Thursday a bill that aims to prevent structures and
development projects from being built in environmentally-sensitive areas, in a
move driven by the major loss of lives and property during Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>If the draft law on national  land planning  clears  the legislature,  people
who illegally  build in areas designated unsuitable for development will face
fines and even criminal charges Premier Wu Den-yih told reporters.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks after the Cabinet approved at its weekly meeting the long-
talked-about bill aimed at better regulating the use of Taiwan's land.</P>
      <P>During Typhoon Morakot, which struck in early August, more than 600 people were
killed, most of whom buried by landslides in areas that had suffered from
deforestation and abusive development.</P>
      <P>In the past few decades, economic development in Taiwan has resulted in many
homes, hotels and other businesses being built in mountainous areas or by rivers
or coastal areas, especially as local residents or governments try to take
advantage of natural scenic attractions to lure tourists.</P>
      <P>It is unclear, however, how effective and well-enforced such a law would be if
passed, as historically in Taiwan, development has been given higher priority
than environmental protection.  For instance, even at Sun Moon Lake - one of the
scenic treasures of Taiwan - hotels are allowed right up against the lake and
not long ago, the government approved a huge five-star hotel to be built nearby.</P>
      <P>The draft statute divides the country into four areas in terms of their
functions -- land conservation area, agricultural development area, urban and
township development area, and marine resources area.</P>
      <P>Each area will be subdivided into several types in terms of features of
environmental sensitivity, such as ecology, cultural and natural landscape,
water resources, natural disaster vulnerability and other resources
conservation.  Each of them will also be classified into several grades based on
the importance of protected targets.</P>
      <P>Areas designated for land conservation will be publicly owned - meaning no
private ownership will be allowed - because it is either ecologically sensitive
or critical to land conservation or landscape maintenance, according to the
Ministry of the Interior-drafted bill.</P>
      <P>If necessary, the government can impose bans on development, restrict human
habitation, or even force people to relocate in order to facilitate land
conservation or restoration, according to the bill.</P>
      <P>Violators of the law may be slapped with fines ranging between NT$1 million
(US$31,250) and NT$5 million.</P>
      <P>If their unlawful land use leads to damage or disasters, perpetrators may be
given a maximum seven-year prison term plus a fine of up to NT$5 million.</P>
      <P>If their illegal actions cause human fatality, the prison term could range
between five years and 12 years, plus a maximum fine of NT$10 million.</P>
      <P>For emergency environmental or ecological protection needs, the government will
be authorized to acquire land,  buildings and facilities located those
restricted areas, according to the bill. The acquisition prices can be
negotiated among relevant parties. If no agreement is reached, the government
can forcibly acquire the land at prices prescribed in existing laws.</P>
      <P>Indigenous people - whose ancestors have lived in certain parts of Taiwan for
thousands of years - however, are not subject to forced relocation without prior
consultations and their final consent, even if their settlements or communities
are located in disaster-prone regions, according to the bill.</P>
      <P>The number of indigenous people in Taiwan is relatively small, at more than
450,000 people.</P>
      <P>According to the bill, the government must complete a national survey and unveil
a comprehensive land classification blueprint within two years after the
legislation is enacted.</P>
      <P>And the new land classification system will be implemented within two years
after the blueprint is promulgated.</P>
      <P>According to the draft statute, a national land sustainable development fund
will be established to facilitate land conservation and ecological protection.</P>
      <P>"Although the bill doest not specify the amount of the planned fund, we hope the
figure can reach at least NT$100 billion (US$3.1 billion)," Wu said.</P>
      <P>The fund will come from several sources, including government budget, private
donations, contributions by state-owned water and electricity companies and
other incomes.</P>
      <P>Money from the fund will pay for such things as compensations, in forced
relocations.</P>

Thursday due mainly to the impact of an appreciation of local currency against
foreign currency.</P>
      <P>The weighted index, the market's key barometer, dropped 105.35 points, or 1.38
percent, to close at 7,503.31.</P>
      <P>The local bourse opened at 7,615.61 and rose to the day's high of 7,635.66 at
one point but then failed to stand above 7,600 as the strong local currency was
weighing on the export-reliant electronics sector.</P>
      <P>The market later retreated to the day's low of 7,500.32 because of profit taking
by investors after the index set a new high Wednesday.</P>
      <P>A total of 5.66 billion shares changed hands on market turnover of NT$160.78
billion (US$5.00 billion).</P>
      <P>All eight major stock categories lost ground, with textile shares falling the
most at 2.37 percent.</P>

pulp issues dropped 0.14 percent, and construction shares lost 0.04 percent.</P>
      <P>Losers outnumbered gainers 1,677 to 950,  with 193 stocks remaining unchanged.</P>
      <P>Foreign institutional investors were net buyers of NT$4 million worth of shares.
They bought a net NT$19.21 billion in shares the previous two days.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday that his administration is planning to send
10,000 Taiwanese students abroad for study or goodwill visits every year as part
of the government's "soft power diplomacy."</P>
      <P>The government also hopes to see 20,000 foreign students come to Taiwan to study
every year so as to allow the international community to get to know and support
Taiwan through such exchanges, Ma said.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks during an event held to present the results of
the International Youth Ambassadors project launched by the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) this past summer.</P>
      <P>Under the initiative, students from three Taiwanese universities were sent
overseas to participate in camps in six South Pacific countries that are
diplomatic allies of Taiwan: Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, the
Solomon Islands and Tuvalu.</P>
      <P>Ma told the students that international exchanges are "the best way to discover
oneself."</P>
      <P>While consolidating the relations with its diplomatic allies will remain a focus
of Taiwan's foreign policy, the government will achieve the goal not only
through interaction between diplomats, but also through deeper contact between
the peoples, Ma said.</P>
      <P>He encouraged the students to visit as many foreign countries as possible to
expand their international experience.</P>
      <P>The MOFA and the Ministry of Education are now studying the possibility of
launching courses that are given entirely in English under the Taiwan
Scholarship program, and many foreign students have expressed interest in the
courses, the president said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government mulling health tax on betel nuts: DOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  8 (CNA)
10/08/09  19:59:23
(By Fanny Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government might levy a health tax on betel nuts with the aim of reducing
consumption and generating tax revenue,  Department of Health (DOH) Minister
Yaung Chih-liang announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level DOH will levy the tax once all technical problems have been
resolved and implementation details are ready, the minister said at the
Legislative Yuan, without mentioning a specific timetable.</P>
      <P>The minister agreed with a proposal by KMT Legislator Lin Hung-chih that a tax
of NT$0.13 per betel nut should be levied as a health tax, but said implementing
the measure would not be easy "as betel nuts are not sold in packs like
cigarettes."</P>
      <P>"Cigarettes are mostly imported by tobacco companies, but betel nuts are planted
by farmers around the country, so it would be very difficult to implement such a
health tax on betel nuts, " he said.</P>
      <P>A Bureau of Health Promotion  official added that selling agricultural products
like betel nuts does not require a business license, and said it would be
unlikely that betel nut vendors would be told to count the nuts they sell and
tax them individually.</P>
      <P>Taiwan raised the health surcharge on tobacco products from NT$10 (US$0.3) to
NT$20 earlier this year and the increase in cost for a pack of cigarettes has
been seen to discourage smoking, according to a health official.</P>
      <P>The move was not welcomed by those who make their living from selling cigarettes
and betel nuts, with one vendor complaining that since the increase in price of
cigarettes, the number of customers has dropped 30 percent. He said the impact
of a betel nut tax would be even more severe.</P>
      <P>The health tax issue has also worried betel nut farmers, who are already
suffering from shrinking business. One angry farmer in Pingtung County in
southern Taiwan told a local newspaper that they might protest against the
proposed tax.</P>
      <P>With millions of Taiwanese chewing the carcinogenic nut, oral cancer has become
the cancer with the fastest increase in mortality rate among male cancer
patients. The betel plantations are also largely responsible for mudslides
during rainy weather, as the root system of the betel palm is very shallow and
provides little anchorage for topsoil.</P>
      <P>However, betel nuts are nevertheless the country's biggest cash crop,  with over
50,000 hectares under cultivation and NT$8.6 billion-worth of production value
in 2008, more than double the production value of rice, according to the Council
of Agriculture.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Palace Museum reaffirms stance on rejecting controversial bronzes</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 8 (CNA)
10/08/09  20:43:27

    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Palace Museum (NPM) will never accept artifacts that are
controversial, stolen or of unknown origin, the museum's curator reiterated
Thursday at a Legislative Yuan session.</P>
      <P>It was the second consecutive day that NPM Director Chou Kung-shin had expounded
on the museum's stance as lawmakers across the political spectrum continued to
question the museum's rejection of a reported offer by a French owner to give it
two bronze statues stolen from China some 150 years ago.</P>
      <P>Pierre Berge, partner of the late French fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent,
reportedly has offered to donate the two bronzes -- a rat head and a rabbit head
-- to a Taiwanese museum, but the offer was rejected because the museum feared
angering China.</P>
      <P>During a legislative session a day earlier, Chou said she was invited by the
French government to visit Paris in June. During the visit, she met with Berge,
who said at the time that he "would neither sell nor donate" the two pieces, she
recalled.</P>
      <P>Chou further said that even if the owner offered to donate the two pieces, the
NPM would not accept them from the perspective of professional ethics.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, lawmakers continued grilling Chou over the issue at a meeting of
the Legislative Yuan's Education and Cultural Affairs Committee.</P>
      <P>In response, Chou once again stressed the museum's stance, saying that the NPM,
as one of the world's most famous museums, should follow professional ethics and
uphold its international image.</P>
      <P>According to a declaration issued by the International Council of Museums (ICOM)
and the United Nations Economic, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
in 1970, Chou said, museums should not procure, accept or exchange artifacts of
illegal origin.</P>
      <P>She also noted that Gary F. Edson, a senior member of the ICOM's ethics
committee, was very positive toward her museum's rejection of the reported
offer.</P>
      <P>The NPM in suburban Taipei is home to the cream of the 1,000-year Chinese art
collection originally stored at the Forbidden City in Beijing and transported to
Taiwan during the Chinese civil war.</P>
      <P>The two controversial bronzes of the Chinese zodiac animals were illegally
seized in 1860 from Beijing's imperial summer palace, Yuanmingyuan, by invading
French and British forces.</P>
      <P>The two items later became part of the Yves Saint Laurent collection. When they
were put up for auction by Berge early this year, it aroused great anger in
China, which demanded their return.</P>
      <P>China's Lost Cultural Relics Recovery Fund, an activist group, filed a petition
in France in an attempt to stop the auction, but a Paris tribunal rejected the
petition.</P>
      <P>The two pieces were sold in the Paris auction in February this year for 15.7
million euros each to a telephone buyer who at the time remained anonymous. A
few days later, Chinese collector Cai Mingchao said that he was the successful
bidder but would refuse to pay for the statues, claiming that his bid was a
"patriotic act" to sabotage the auction.</P>
      <P>The two statues have since been sitting in a safe room at Christie's auction
house.</P>
      <P>According to a Reuters report, Berge has said he will return the two pieces to
China only if the country guarantees human rights and allows the exiled Tibetan
spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, to return home.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou hailed advancing Japan-Taiwan ties Thursday and expressed

Party of Japan.</P>
      <P>The group was the first of its kind to visit Taiwan since Japan's power transfer

      <P>Describing overall relations between the two countries as having become even

      <P>Following his inauguration, Ma designated Taiwan-Japan ties as a "special

    <HEADLINE>Defense Ministry denies vacillation on arms procurement policy</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has never vacillated over its arms procurement policy but has
remained firm and consistent on the issue, the Ministry of National Defense
(MND) said Thursday in a statement.</P>
      <P>The ministry issued the statement after Mei Fu-hsing, a local military analyst,
said in an article published in the Apple Daily that same day that the
government was inconsistent in its bids to procure weapons from the United
States.</P>
      <P>The MND statement said the criticism was unfair because the government has never
wavered on its stance with regard to purchasing defensive weapons from the
United States, including F-16 C/D jet fighters.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has reiterated his administration's desire to acquire
U.S.-built F-16 C/Ds and other weapons on many public occasions, including an
April 22 teleconference with the Center for Strategic and International Studies
to mark the 30th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act and a statement issued
during a May 26 transit stop in the United States on his way to Central America
for a diplomatic visit, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, it went on, Ma has taken advantage of meetings with visiting U.S.
politicians and academics to express the government's arms procurement stance.</P>
      <P>In addition,  the statement said,  government and military authorities, as well
as the legislative branch, have through various channels asked the U.S.
government to provide Taiwan with the defensive weapons it needs to protect its
security in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act, the U.S. law that
regulates relations with Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>In speeches to military personnel at various levels,  the statement continued,
Ma has also repeatedly reminded them that despite the government's efforts to
improve relations with China and reduce tension in the Taiwan Strait, China has
not changed its position on the use of force against Taiwan. Therefore, he said,
the military should never relax its combat preparedness and should continue to
hone its combat skills to safeguard national security.</P>
      <P>"This indicates that our government's policy on arms procurement has not
changed," the statement added.</P>

      <P>An exhibition featuring some 100 Chinese animal paintings and objects from
museums in Taiwan, China and the United States will open Oct. 9 and run through
Jan. 3, 2010 at the Cincinnati Art Museum,  museum director Aaron Betsky
announced Wednesday at an opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>Of the exhibits, 20 original animal paintings has been loaned by the National
Palace Museum in Taipei, said Lee Wen-chi, press chief of the Taipei Economic
and Cultural Office in Chicago (TECO-Chicago), who attended the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Describing the exhibition as the research results of Sung Hou-mei, the curator
of Asian art at the museum, over the past 20 years, Betsky said the exhibition
took five years to prepare.</P>
      <P>The exhibition examines the evolution of the symbolic language of Chinese animal
imagery and highlights paintings, from the Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties,
Lee said.</P>
      <P>TECO-Chicago Director Perry Pei-hwang Shen note that the National Palace Museum
rarely lends the national treasures in its collection to other countries.</P>
      <P>However, to show the importance Taiwan attaches to enhancing comprehensive
exchanges with the United States, particularly in the area of culture and arts,
the museum agreed to lend the treasures for the exhibition, according to Shen.</P>
      <P>The exhibition will showcase 86 paintings and dozens of objects, with 15
paintings selected from the Palace Museum in Beijing and the Shanghai Museum,
and many other artifacts from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Art Institute
of Chicago, Princeton University Art Museum, and the Nelso-Atkins Museum of Art

      <P>One of the oldest arts institutions in the United States, the Cincinnati Art

      <P>Taiwan will not rule out the possibility of holding negotiations with China on
political issues, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lai made the remarks while meeting an 11-member delegation from the Center for a
New American Security (CNAS) led by its CEO, Nathaniel Fick.</P>
      <P>She noted, however, that the government does not have a timetable for this kind
of cross-Taiwan Strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>In dealing with China, Lai went on, priority will be given to the "easier,
urgent and economic issues, and those issues deemed as difficult, not urgent and
politics-related" will only be touched upon when the time is right.</P>
      <P>Lai said that at the moment, the time is not ripe for Taiwan and China to
establish a confidence-building mechanism (CBM) and sign a bilateral peace
agreement.</P>
      <P>"This is because public opinion is divergent on Taiwan's policy toward China,
and consensus in this regard has yet to be reached, " she said.</P>
      <P>Lai expressed hope that both Taiwan and China will seek to resolve problems
resulting from cross-strait exchanges by shelving their disputes rather than
confronting each other.</P>
      <P>She noted that the present thaw in cross-strait relations and maintaining the
cross-strait status quo are in the interest of not only Taiwan and China but
also the entire Asia-Pacific region and the world.</P>
      <P>Since President Ma Ying-jeou was inaugurated in May last year, Taiwan has signed
several agreements  with China on promoting cross-strait exchanges.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan, China ready to exchange ECFA `early harvest' list</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 8 (CNA)
10/08/09  23:00:44
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Officials from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are scheduled to meet in mid-
October to exchange "early harvest" lists to be included in a much-anticipated
bilateral economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) , an official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The two sides have held three rounds of informal talks on ECFA issues and are
likely to begin formal talks late this month, " said the official from the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) who spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>Before a round of formal talks begins, officials from the MOEA's Bureau of
Foreign Trade and China's Ministry of Commerce will hold one more informal round
of talks in the middle of this month, the official went on.</P>
      <P>"The venue for the informal talks could be determined Friday, " the official
said, adding that the most important thing during the mid-October meeting will
be for the two sides to exchange their "early harvest" lists.</P>
      <P>When that happens, the official said, the lists of industries or services that
each side will open for tariff concessions or more liberal trade terms will
become clear.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the official went on, the ministry has already outlined major
principles that guided the selection of the targeted items, but said that no
details would be revealed at present.</P>
      <P>In the service sector, the MOEA has targeted areas that China agreed to open
when it was seeking accession to the World Trade Organization but which still
remain inaccessible to Taiwan, the official said.</P>
      <P>Other targeted areas are services for which China has granted preferential
tariffs to other countries, and those that are favorable to Taiwan, he added.</P>
      <P>According to an ECFA impact assessment report released recently by the MOEA, the
government might request China to open up its market to financial, computer-
related, R&amp;D, logistics,  civil aircraft maintenance, and freight forwarding
services from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the merchandise trade front, the official continued, Taiwan expects China to
open its market to export items that are favorable to Taiwan but are subject to
high Chinese tariffs.</P>
      <P>Others are those for which China has granted preferential duties to its free
trade agreement partners, and sensitive goods that Taiwan hopes can be opened up
flexibly, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, President Ma Ying-jeou has said that Taiwan hopes an "early harvest"
clause can be included in the proposed ECFA to reduce the impact of the new
China-Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) free trade area on
Taiwanese businesses.</P>
      <P>After the China-ASEAN economic integration, which begins Jan. 1, 2010,
petrochemical products,  textiles,  automobile parts and machinery exports from
ASEAN members to China will enjoy tariff-free treatment, which will seriously
undermine the competitiveness of similar products from Taiwan, Ma said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou hailed advancing Japan-Taiwan ties Thursday and expressed
hope that a "special partnership" relationship can help further two-way ties on
the back of the major breakthroughs achieved since his inauguration in May 2008.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks when receiving  a delegation  at the Presidential Office of
dietmen from Japan's lower house led by Nakatsugawa Hirosato of the Democratic
Party of Japan.</P>
      <P>The group was the first of its kind to visit Taiwan since Japan's power transfer
in September.</P>
      <P>Describing overall relations between the two countries as having become even
closer and stronger since he took office, Ma said Taiwan and Japan must seek to
more effectively reinforce and enhance their exchanges due to their geographic
proximity and historical links.</P>
      <P>Following his inauguration, Ma designated Taiwan-Japan ties as a "special
partnership" and concrete improvement in bilateral relations has been made over
the past 17 months.</P>
      <P>Apart from an implementation of a reciprocal working holiday program for
students of the two countries from June last year, the president said, Taiwan is
set to open a cultural center in Tokyo and an office in Sapporo late this month,
while four daily direct Taipei-Tokyo flights will be resumed next year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has never vacillated over its arms procurement policy but has
remained firm and consistent on the issue, the Ministry of National Defense
(MND) said Thursday in a statement.</P>
      <P>The ministry issued the statement after Mei Fu-hsing, a local military analyst,
said in an article published in the Apple Daily that same day that the
government was inconsistent in its bids to procure weapons from the United
States.</P>
      <P>The MND statement said the criticism was unfair because the government has never
wavered on its stance with regard to purchasing defensive weapons from the
United States, including F-16 C/D jet fighters.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has reiterated his administration's desire to acquire
U.S.-built F-16 C/Ds and other weapons on many public occasions, including an
April 22 teleconference with the Center for Strategic and International Studies
to mark the 30th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act and a statement issued
during a May 26 transit stop in the United States on his way to Central America
for a diplomatic visit, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, it went on, Ma has taken advantage of meetings with visiting U.S.
politicians and academics to express the government's arms procurement stance.</P>
      <P>In addition,  the statement said,  government and military authorities, as well
as the legislative branch, have through various channels asked the U.S.
government to provide Taiwan with the defensive weapons it needs to protect its
security in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act, the U.S. law that
regulates relations with Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>In speeches to military personnel at various levels,  the statement continued,
Ma has also repeatedly reminded them that despite the government's efforts to
improve relations with China and reduce tension in the Taiwan Strait, China has
not changed its position on the use of force against Taiwan. Therefore, he said,
the military should never relax its combat preparedness and should continue to
hone its combat skills to safeguard national security.</P>
      <P>"This indicates that our government's policy on arms procurement has not
changed," the statement added.</P>

      <P>An exhibition featuring some 100 Chinese animal paintings and objects from
museums in Taiwan, China and the United States will open Oct. 9 and run through
Jan. 3, 2010 at the Cincinnati Art Museum,  museum director Aaron Betsky
announced Wednesday at an opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>Of the exhibits, 20 original animal paintings has been loaned by the National
Palace Museum in Taipei, said Lee Wen-chi, press chief of the Taipei Economic
and Cultural Office in Chicago (TECO-Chicago), who attended the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Describing the exhibition as the research results of Sung Hou-mei, the curator
of Asian art at the museum, over the past 20 years, Betsky said the exhibition
took five years to prepare.</P>
      <P>The exhibition examines the evolution of the symbolic language of Chinese animal
imagery and highlights paintings, from the Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties,
Lee said.</P>
      <P>TECO-Chicago Director Perry Pei-hwang Shen note that the National Palace Museum
rarely lends the national treasures in its collection to other countries.</P>
      <P>However, to show the importance Taiwan attaches to enhancing comprehensive
exchanges with the United States, particularly in the area of culture and arts,
the museum agreed to lend the treasures for the exhibition, according to Shen.</P>
      <P>The exhibition will showcase 86 paintings and dozens of objects, with 15
paintings selected from the Palace Museum in Beijing and the Shanghai Museum,
and many other artifacts from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Art Institute

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will not rule out the possibility of holding negotiations with China on
political issues, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lai made the remarks while meeting an 11-member delegation from the Center for a
New American Security (CNAS) led by its CEO, Nathaniel Fick.</P>
      <P>She noted, however, that the government does not have a timetable for this kind
of cross-Taiwan Strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>In dealing with China, Lai went on, priority will be given to the "easier,
urgent and economic issues, and those issues deemed as difficult, not urgent and
politics-related" will only be touched upon when the time is right.</P>
      <P>Lai said that at the moment, the time is not ripe for Taiwan and China to
establish a confidence-building mechanism (CBM) and sign a bilateral peace
agreement.</P>
      <P>"This is because public opinion is divergent on Taiwan's policy toward China,
and consensus in this regard has yet to be reached, " she said.</P>
      <P>Lai expressed hope that both Taiwan and China will seek to resolve problems
resulting from cross-strait exchanges by shelving their disputes rather than
confronting each other.</P>
      <P>She noted that the present thaw in cross-strait relations and maintaining the
cross-strait status quo are in the interest of not only Taiwan and China but
also the entire Asia-Pacific region and the world.</P>
      <P>Since President Ma Ying-jeou was inaugurated in May last year, Taiwan has signed
several agreements  with China on promoting cross-strait exchanges.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan, China ready to exchange ECFA `early harvest' list</HEADLINE>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Officials from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are scheduled to meet in mid-
October to exchange "early harvest" lists to be included in a much-anticipated
bilateral economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) , an official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The two sides have held three rounds of informal talks on ECFA issues and are
likely to begin formal talks late this month, " said the official from the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) who spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>Before a round of formal talks begins, officials from the MOEA's Bureau of
Foreign Trade and China's Ministry of Commerce will hold one more informal round
of talks in the middle of this month, the official went on.</P>
      <P>"The venue for the informal talks could be determined Friday, " the official
said, adding that the most important thing during the mid-October meeting will
be for the two sides to exchange their "early harvest" lists.</P>
      <P>When that happens, the official said, the lists of industries or services that
each side will open for tariff concessions or more liberal trade terms will
become clear.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the official went on, the ministry has already outlined major
principles that guided the selection of the targeted items, but said that no
details would be revealed at present.</P>
      <P>In the service sector, the MOEA has targeted areas that China agreed to open
when it was seeking accession to the World Trade Organization but which still
remain inaccessible to Taiwan, the official said.</P>
      <P>Other targeted areas are services for which China has granted preferential
tariffs to other countries, and those that are favorable to Taiwan, he added.</P>
      <P>According to an ECFA impact assessment report released recently by the MOEA, the
government might request China to open up its market to financial, computer-
related, R&amp;D, logistics,  civil aircraft maintenance, and freight forwarding
services from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the merchandise trade front, the official continued, Taiwan expects China to
open its market to export items that are favorable to Taiwan but are subject to
high Chinese tariffs.</P>
      <P>Others are those for which China has granted preferential duties to its free
trade agreement partners, and sensitive goods that Taiwan hopes can be opened up
flexibly, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, President Ma Ying-jeou has said that Taiwan hopes an "early harvest"
clause can be included in the proposed ECFA to reduce the impact of the new
China-Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) free trade area on
Taiwanese businesses.</P>
      <P>After the China-ASEAN economic integration, which begins Jan. 1, 2010,
petrochemical products,  textiles,  automobile parts and machinery exports from
ASEAN members to China will enjoy tariff-free treatment, which will seriously
undermine the competitiveness of similar products from Taiwan, Ma said.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan High Court ruled early Friday that former President Chen Shui-bian
should remain in custody, on the grounds that he might abscond if released from
detention.</P>
      <P>A three-judge panel arrived at the ruling after six hours of debate between
prosecutors and three lawyers representing Chen. The session was held after the
Supreme Court revoked the panel's Sept. 24 ruling to keep the former president
in custody for another three months and ordered another hearing.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court said the earlier high court ruling could not stand because it
failed to clearly identify the facts that it cited as evidence to support Chen's
continued detention.</P>
      <P>In its fresh ruling, however, the judges said that "chances are extremely high"
that Chen might flee and that there are also facts to support their opinion.</P>
      <P>The judges said that Chen, who was president for eight years and took part in
many secret diplomatic missions, has had the chance to come into contact with
foreign governments and members of the private sector, making him "more familiar
than ordinary people with ways to flee overseas."</P>
      <P>With Chen's influence and the assets stashed overseas by his family, he could
live a comfortable life if he were to run away to evade the severe sentence that
he could face, the judges said.</P>
      <P>They noted that Chen still attempted to hide his overseas assets even after the
family's money-laundering activities were uncovered by the international anti-
money laundering organization Egmont Group in early 2008.</P>
      <P>On the Supreme Court's claim that a 24-hour security service for the former
president would bar him from absconding, the judges pointed out that the
security officers have only been assigned to protect him and have no
responsibility to report his whereabouts to the judicial authorities.</P>
      <P>Both Chen and his wife Wu Shu-jen were sentenced Sept. 11 by the Taipei District
Court to life in prison, in addition to receiving fines of NT$200 million
(US$6.13 million) and NT$300 million, respectively, on several counts of
corruption, including embezzling from a presidential fund for state affairs,
taking bribes from local businessmen and money laundering.</P>
      <P>The high court panel took charge of Chen's case Sept. 24 after he appealed the
judgment. The panel ruled that same day that Chen should remain in custody for
another three months.</P>
      <P>The former president was first detained Nov. 12, 2008 and was released Dec. 13
following his indictment.</P>
      <P>He was detained again Dec. 30 after the Taipei District Court approved a request
by prosecutors to take him back into custody and he has not been released since.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese trade mission exploring Brazilian market</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An ongoing Taiwanese trade mission to Latin America visited Sao Paulo, Brazil's
commercial and industrial center, Thursday to seek trade opportunities and
promote Taiwanese brands.</P>
      <P>The mission, organized by the semi-official Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA) ,  includes representatives of 23 Taiwanese companies involved
in auto and motorcycle parts, machinery, textiles and eight other industries,
according to Chu Chien-tsai, a TAITRA official in charge of market exploration.</P>
      <P>It is the second time this year that TAITRA has organized a Taiwanese trade
mission to visit Brazil, on the grounds that Brazil is not only one of the newly
emerging markets dubbed the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) but also the
largest market in South America.</P>
      <P>Chu said that although two-way trade between Taiwan and Brazil slid over the
past year due to the global economic crunch, business exchanges between the two
countries are expected to pick up steam in the latter months of the year.</P>
      <P>"I anticipate that today's trade talks will pick up new orders and consequently
give a boost to two-way business, " Chu told CNA.</P>
      <P>According to official Brazilian trade figures, Taiwan's exports to Brazil
amounted to US$1.31 billion in the first eight months of this year, representing
a year-on-year decline of 42.04 percent, while imports from Brazil totaled
US$664 million, down 49.34 percent.</P>
      <P>Mission leader Sun Cheng-tah, chairman of Sungreat General Supply Co., which is
one of Taiwan's top five suppliers of auto parts and accessories, said Taiwanese
businesses should grasp the golden opportunities presented by Brazil's economic
takeoff to explore their overseas markets.</P>
      <P>In general, he said, South America is a huge but volatile and unstable market.
"The only way to survive the South American market and thrive there is to
incessantly explore new markets and get new customers," Sun said.</P>
      <P>In addition to promoting auto and motorcycle parts, Sun said, his company is
also expected to seek Brazilian partners to start a joint venture in which parts
can be assembled locally.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chiu Ju-chun, director of the TAITRA trade center in Brazil, said
that after a series of downturns since late last year, the Brazilian currency
began to appreciate in April this year and that currently, the Brazil real
stands at about 1.8 to the U.S. dollar, a value that is conducive to imports.</P>
      <P>With its gross domestic product (GDP) edging up 1.9 percent in the second
quarter of this year, the Brazilian government is confident that Brazil's GDP
will grow at least 1 percent for the whole of 2009, Chiu said.</P>
      <P>The mission, which has visited Argentina's capital Buenos Aires, where it
secured orders worth a total of US$3.18 million, is scheduled to visit Ecuador
and Mexico on the last legs of its Latin America tour.</P>

      <P>The Taipei-based American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) said in a recent press
release that it will host a series of activities to "introduce American style
BBQ and blues music to the people of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>"This is the first time AIT has taken the initiative to link an American food
promotion with live American blues music. Blues and BBQ go hand in hand in the
United States, " Keith Schneller, the director of AIT's Agricultural Trade
Office (ATO), was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>In cooperation with the Taichung city government, the U.S. Meat Export
Federation, and various other sponsors, the ATO is bringing Joey Gilmore,
champion of the 2006 International Blues Challenge, to Taiwan to perform and
promote American-style BBQ at venues around the island, according to the AIT
press release.</P>
      <P>This will include the opening weekend of the 2009 Taichung Jazz Festival Oct.
17-18, and an American BBQ and Blues Pavilion at the J1 stage on Jingkuo
Boulevard at the Taichung Jazz Festival, which will offer an enticing array of
American BBQ products, beer and spirits, it added.</P>
      <P>In addition, the ATO, along with Shangri-La's Far Eastern Hotel Taipei and Hotel
ONE Taichung will also launch special menu promotions to celebrate American BBQ
and Blues Month.</P>
      <P>Chef David Ansted from Shangri-La's Far Eastern Hotel Taipei has selected Texas
and Memphis, Tennessee barbecue styles for his menu, while Chef Nick Alvarez
from Hotel ONE Taichung will prepare a Memphis-style smoked barbecued beef using
a Tennessee whiskey-glazed BBQ sauce with a touch of coffee, according to the
press release.</P>
      <P>During the promotion, any consumer who orders from an American BBQ special menu
can participate in a lucky draw for a chance to win Delta/Northwest  Airline
tickets  and gift  certificates  from participating hotels and restaurants.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou renewed Friday a call for the United States to sign an
extradition agreement with Taiwan to facilitate the repatriation of fugitives
from justice.</P>
      <P>Raising the issue while receiving a delegation of the U.S. National Association
of Attorneys General (NAAG), Ma pointed out that he put forth a similar proposal
when the NAAG last visited Taiwan in 2008.</P>
      <P>While there had been no progress in Taiwan's efforts to establish judicial
cooperation with China back then, the two sides signed an agreement on the issue
in April this year to allow for the repatriation of criminals and suspects, Ma
pointed out.</P>
      <P>"Our American friends all feel that the United States should speed up its pace
in this regard," he said.</P>
      <P>Ma told the NAAG delegates that his administration officially ratified in May
this year the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights that the country
signed in 1967.</P>
      <P>Although the Republic of China is no longer a member of the United Nations,
which makes it unlikely that the country would be allowed to deposit the
ratification instruments with the world body, its support for the two covenants
remains unchanged, the president said.</P>
      <P>He said the Ministry of Justice has drafted legislation to allow for the
covenants' implementation in Taiwan and that the bills are pending approval by
the Legislative Yuan for enactment into law.</P>
      <P>Ma pledged that the government will strictly comply with the standards of the
two covenants to enhance Taiwan's human rights protection.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taichung High Court rejected an appeal filed by ruling Kuomintang (KMT)
Legislator Chiang Lien-fu from Taichung County and invalidated his election
Friday on the grounds that he engaged in vote buying.</P>
      <P>Chiang appealed soon after the Taichung District Court ruled on Feb. 27 to
invalidate his election on the same grounds.</P>
      <P>The district court ruled that Chiang, who was caught on a video tape offering
NT$50,000 (US$1,550) to a local voter, Chen Lien-ji, before the legislative
election on Jan. 12, 2008, intended to buy Chen's vote with money.</P>
      <P>The court dismissed Chiang's argument that he was set up by his political rivals
and the money was meant for Chen to organize campaign rallies for him, rather
than as a reward for his personal ballot.</P>
      <P>The court's ruling was made in a case initiated by Chiang's Democratic
Progressive Party rival in that election, Chien Chao-dung.</P>
      <P>Chiang then appealed the court's decision.</P>
      <P>A by-election will be scheduled within three months after the Central Election
Commission (CEC) receives a notification from the Taichung High Court about the
invalidation of Chiang's election, according to the CEC office in Taichung
County.</P>
      <P>That by-election will be the third of its kind this year after one was held in
March involving KMT Legislator Lee Yi-ting from Miaoli County and the second
held in September involving KMT Legislator Chang Sho-wen representing Yunlin
County,  both for vote-buying.</P>
      <P>Now that Chiang's election has been mullified, the KMT holds 78 seats in the
113-seat legislature, with the opposition Democratic Progressive Party holding
28.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The practice of wiretapping criminal organizations or suspected criminals as
well as intelligence targets has been on the decline since President Ma Ying-
jeou assumed office on May 20, 2008, the National Security Bureau (NSB) said in
a statement Friday.</P>
      <P>According to the statement, the frequency of wiretaps on criminal targets fell
65.46 percent in Ma's first 15 months in office, while the  frequency  of
wiretaps  aimed  at  obtaining  national security-related intelligence has
fallen 56.99 percent.</P>
      <P>The rate of change was obtained by comparing the numbers during Ma's time in
office to those in the final 15 months of the previous Democratic Progressive
Party administration.</P>
      <P>None of the wiretaps were conducted unlawfully, the NSB said.</P>
      <P>The NSB report on intelligence monitoring was compiled after Ma ordered a
thorough investigation into wiretapping by government intelligence units after a
local newspaper reported Sept. 28 that the practice has increased in the Ma
administration.</P>
      <P>The report,  citing an anonymous official responsible  for intelligence affairs,
raised the concerns of lawmakers in both the ruling and opposition parties as
well as the administration.</P>
      <P>NSB officials  are scheduled to brief lawmakers  on their investigation at the
Legislative Yuan Monday.</P>

      <P>Buyers placed substantial orders on the first day of the 35th Taipei
International  Electronic  Show (TAITRONICS) Thursday, an indication that the
electronics industry is on the road to recovery, the Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA) said Friday.</P>
      <P>On the opening day of the show that attracted more than 10,000 domestic and
foreign buyers, US$150 million in orders were given to local suppliers in
private face-to-face meetings, a TAITRA statement said.</P>
      <P>The one-day total nearly matched the US$170 million in orders placed in the
three days of private meetings at last year's show, continuing a run of
promising news in an industry that has been battered by the global economic
downturn.</P>
      <P>According to local customs statistics, electronics has been one of Taiwan's
three fastest growing export sectors in recent months. Electronics shipments in
August were US$550 million higher than in July.</P>
      <P>August electronics shipments were still 32 percent lower than in August 2008,
but the rate of decline was more than 10 percentage points lower than for July.</P>
      <P>Jointly hosted by TAITRA and the Taiwan Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers'
Association, the electronics show will run from Oct. 8-11. at the Taiwan World
Trade Center Nangang Exhibition Hall in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Electronic components, manufacturing and testing equipment, LEDs and lighting,
and safety and security products, are among some of the products being
highlighted at TAITRONICS 2009, according to TAITRA.</P>
      <P>Top caliber Taiwanese suppliers, such as Tektronix, Agilent, Taiwan Alpha
Electronic, OasisTek, GWinstek, TYNTEK, GKB are among the show's 850 exhibitors
occupying 1,700 booths who are hoping to meet the sourcing needs of buyers from
around the globe.</P>
      <P>"The combination of China's enormous production capability and Taiwan's strict
quality control and R&amp;D offers worldwide buyers more product variety and
greater flexibility at a competitive price, " TAITRA said in the statement.</P>
      <P>Aside from the star lineup of Taiwanese suppliers, the show also features a
"China Pavilion" comprised of about 100 Chinese vendors packed into a 1,080
-square-meter display area.</P>
      <P>TAITRA said a total of 850 one-on-one meetings will be organized during the
exhibition to broker business opportunities between Taiwanese suppliers and
foreign buyers.</P>
      <P>It is expecting 5,000 buyers from abroad and 70,000 professionals from Taiwan to

    <HEADLINE>DPP denies plan to invite Falun Gong founder to Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on Friday denied a report that
it was planning to invite Li Hongzhi, the founder of the Falun Gong movement
that has been banned in China, to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Responding to a report in the China Times, DPP acting spokesman Chuang Suo-hang
said he had not heard about the idea and denied that the party had any plans to
invite Li.</P>
      <P>Asked if the invitation would be made by civic groups, Chuang said it would be
within the scope of freedom of speech and religion and that the DPP would
respect their decision.</P>
      <P>The government  of President Ma Ying-jeou should make its intentions clear,
however, if it were to reject Li's visit based on national security
considerations or other grounds.</P>
      <P>An invitation to Li to visit Taiwan would be the third to individuals considered
anathema by China's government in recent months.</P>
      <P>The DPP invited exiled Tibetan leader the Dalai Lama in late August to comfort
victims of Typhoon Morakot, and a pro-independence group invited exiled Uighur
rights activist Rebiya Kadeer last month to visit Taiwan in conjunction with the
screening of a documentary about her life at a local film festival.</P>
      <P>While the DPP and civic groups contended the moves were not political, critics
saw them as attempts to create politically awkward situations for the president,
who has pushed to improve ties with China.</P>
      <P>The Ma administration allowed the Dalai Lama to visit Taiwan, to the surprise of
some, but it rejected Kadeer's application for a visa.</P>
      <P>Chuang panned the government's snub of the Uighur activist, accused by Beijing
of fomenting violence in Xinjiang province, as a move to please China that not
only runs counter to Taiwan's principles as a free and democratic nation but
also contravenes the universal value of human rights.</P>
      <P>Touching on a ruling handed down by the Taiwan High Court early Friday that
former President Chen Shui-bian should remain in custody, on the grounds that he
might abscond if released from detention, Chuang said that the DPP regretted the
verdict and would discuss with Chen's lawyers how to protect his judicial human
rights.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Oscar-winning director Ang Lee said Friday he looks forward to seeing the head
of Taiwan's Government Information Office (GIO) stay on the job for a longer
time than his predecessors to better contribute to the development of the
country's film industry.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan-born, New York-based director, who returned to Taipei recently to
promote his new film "Taking Woodstock, " expressed his hope while meeting with
GIO Minister Su Jun-pin.</P>
      <P>Lee said that whenever he returns to Taiwan, he invariably pays a visit to the
GIO, which is responsible for administering the country's film sector.</P>
      <P>"It seems to me that I tend to be received by a different minister each time,"
Lee said.</P>
      <P>As each minister usually has his or her own policy direction for the film
industry, Lee said he is afraid that none of their policy proposals can be
implemented fully.</P>
      <P>"You are still young. I'm hopeful that you will stay longer so that you will
have enough time to put your policy ideas into practice and thus contribute to
Taiwan's movie industry development, " Lee told Su.</P>
      <P>In response, Su said he is a passionate supporter of the film industry, as the
movie world is full of human interest.</P>
      <P>Noting that Lee's films have consistently drawn large crowds of filmmaking
professionals in Taipei, Su said Lee's films tend to help instill new spirit,
new inspiration and new strength in Taiwan's film sector.</P>
      <P>Lee's achievements  have also helped encourage  many young Taiwanese film
directors to confidently continue their pursuit of professional excellence, Su
said.</P>
      <P>"We also hope that our filmmakers and directors can find a niche for development
so that one day Taiwan can emerge as a new mecca for the Chinese-language
moviedom," he added.</P>
      <P>Lee, who traveled to the United States for advanced study after graduating from
the National Taiwan University of Arts, made his directorial debut in 1992 with
Pushing Hands, a dramedy highlighting the tension between tradition and
modernity, which arises when a retired Tai Chi master moves to the U.S. to live
with his Westernized son.</P>
      <P>His next two offerings, The Wedding Banquet (1993) and Eat Drink Man Woman
(1994), each landed an Oscar nomination in the Best Foreign Film category.</P>
      <P>Since then, the versatile director has successfully tackled an impressive
variety of genres, reflected in a resume which includes a literary classic
(Sense and Sensibility) , a dysfunctional family drama (The Ice Storm), a
Western (Ride with the Devil), a gay-themed romance (Brokeback Mountain) , an
erotic, espionage thriller (Lust, Caution), a comic book adaptation (Hulk) and a
martial arts fairytale (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon).</P>
      <P>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon won an Oscar for Best Foreign Film, while Lee
himself won the best director award in 2006 for Brokeback Mountain.</P>
      <P>Lee's new film, Taking Woodstock, is a comedy about the 1969 concert that helped
define the Hippie Generation.</P>

      <P>One of them will be kabuki, a type of classical Japanese dance-drama  that
integrates song,  dance and skills that was proclaimed by the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 2005 as one of the
masterpieces of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity.</P>
      <P>A kabuki lecture and demonstration presented by Shochiku Company Limited is
scheduled for Oct. 10-11 at the Recital Hall of the National Theater and Concert
Hall in Taipei, officials at the National Chiang Kai-shek Cultural Center said.</P>
      <P>The event, which includes a short performance and a lecture, will take the
audience into the mysterious and breathtaking world of kabuki, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the 2009 Asia-Pacific Traditional Arts Festival being held at the
National Headquarters of Taiwan Traditional Arts in Yilan County will feature
Khmer shadow theater and Khmer classical dance by Cambodia's Sovanna Phum Art
Association Oct. 10-11.</P>
      <P>Khmer shadow theater, also known as the royal ballet of Cambodia, was proclaimed
a cultural heritage by UNESCO in 2003.</P>
      <P>The art form, which narrowly escaped extinction in the 1970s, has been closely
associated with the Khmer court for more than 1,000 years. Performances would
traditionally accompany royal ceremonies and observances such as coronations,
marriages, funerals or Khmer holidays.</P>
      <P>Khmer shadow theater, or the sbek thom, was added to the UNESCO list of cultural
heritages in 2005.</P>
      <P>The sbek thom features two-meter tall, non-articulated puppets made of leather
openwork. The performances traditionally take place at night outdoors. The
shadows of the puppets' silhouettes are projected onto a white screen set up in
front of a large fire or, nowadays, projectors.</P>
      <P>Also taking part in the arts festival is the Mandalay Marionettes Theater from
Myanmar, which will perform Burmese string puppet shows that are rarely seen in
Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT legislative caucus nixes betel nut plan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) on Friday nixed a proposal
by the Department of Health (DOH) to impose a health tax on betel nut, saying it
would hurt the livelihoods of grassroots residents.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus whip Lu Hsueh-chang praised the DOH's tax proposal, aimed
at protecting the public's health over the long run, as a good idea.</P>
      <P>But he said that the livelihood of the public, particularly those at the
grassroots level, should be taken into consideration when a new law is being
initiated.</P>
      <P>"Currently it is imappropriate and unnecessary to impose a betel nut tax," Lu
argued.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 1.37 million betel nut chewers in Taiwan, according to
the latest DOH survey.</P>
      <P>Betel nuts, grown on over 50,000 hectares of land around the country, are
currently the country's biggest cash crop. In 2008, betel nut production was
worth NT$8.6 billion, more than double the production value of rice, according
to the Council of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>DOH Minister Yaung Chih-liang said at the Legislative Yuan Thursday that the DOH
was studying the feasibility of levying a health tax on betel nuts to reduce
consumption and generate tax revenue.</P>
      <P>The minister supported the idea of imposing a tax of NT$0.13 per betel nut, or
NT$2-3 for each pack of 20 nuts on average.</P>
      <P>"We've been collecting cigarette taxes with success, " Yaung said to
legislators. "Why not levy a tax or surtax on betel nut consumption?"</P>
      <P>He acknowledged at the time, however, that it would be very difficult to collect
such a tax, as betel nuts are not sold in packs like cigarettes.</P>
      <P>Chao Kun-yu, a Bureau of Health Promotion deputy director, added that selling
agricultural products like betel nuts does not require a business license, and
he said it would be unlikely that betel nut vendors would be told to count the
nuts they sell and tax them individually.</P>
      <P>Chao said that before the betel nut tax plan matures, the DOH will accelerate
its oral cancer screening campaign, as 90 percent of Taiwan's oral and
esophageal cancer patients have chewed betel nuts.</P>
      <P>Citing foreign medical reports indicating that effective oral cancer screening
contributes to lowering fatalities by 43 percent, Chao said efforts to screen
for oral cancer should take precedence over the tax legislation.</P>
      <P>Some 5,000 new oral cancer cases are reported in the country each year, with
2,300 people losing their lives to the disease.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Former top Chinese aide says fighting corruption easier in Taiwan</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 9 (CNA)

(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A former aide to the late Communist Party of China (CPC) boss Zhao Ziyang
recently spoke highly of the current form of democracy in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Bao Tong, who was expelled by the Communist Party after the Tiananmen Massacre
on June 4, 1989, and was sentenced to seven years in jail for "leaking national
secrets, " praised Taiwan's system in an essay marking Taiwan's National Day
celebration.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, where there is no socialism, it is possible to ferret out corruption
openly, Bao said in his essay posted on Free Radio Asia's Web site.</P>
      <P>Bao said that while Taiwan had long since reversed the official verdict on a
massacre of demonstrators by Kuomintang (KMT) troops in 1947, in China to this
day, no one dares mention "June 4, 1989."</P>
      <P>"Courts in Taiwan have the power to pass judgment on high-ranking officials, "
wrote Bao.</P>
      <P>In contrast, "on the mainland, where we enjoy the benefits of the dictatorship
of the proletariat, masses of people who turn out to protest at corruption are
suppressed as troublemakers, " he wrote, referring to the 1989 military
crackdown on student-led protests on Tiananmen Square.</P>
      <P>While China on Oct. 1 held the largest-ever parade in Beijing to celebrate its
60th founding anniversary, Bao said the last 60 years of glorious Communist rule
contained "a big lie."</P>
      <P>"In the first 30 years, tens of millions either died of starvation or were
'harrassed'  to death under the banner of revolution, " said Bao, who has been
kept under house arrest in Beijing since his release from jail on May 1996.</P>
      <P>"In the second 30 years, anyone standing up for civil and constitutional rights,
for religious freedom, or for ethnic autonomy has been declared an enemy of the
people en masse, all in the name of stability."</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Hong Kong Apple Daily, Bao said the power struggle
within the Communist Party continues to this day. He argued that former Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, who retired in late 2002 as CPC general secretary,
continues to hold great influence in the party and is "bullying" incumbent
President Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>He said this was evidenced by the appearance of Jiang alongside his successor Hu
atop the Tiananmen Squre rostrum to review the military parade marking China's
60th founding anniversary.</P>
      <P>According to Bao, Jiang got much more attention from China's state-run media
during the parade and the ensuing party in the evening than any other Chinese
leader except for Hu.</P>

10/09/09  18:47:13
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Friday:</P>
      <P>Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>The chief of Taiwan's National Palace Museum Chou Kung-shin rejected a French
art collector's donation of two bronze sculptures seized from a Beijing palace
in 1860 by invading French and British forces, citing the "museum's professional
ethics" as the reason.</P>
      <P>We have to point out that Chou rejected the donated pieces more out of fear of
offending China than on ethical grounds.</P>
      <P>The bronze sculptures, the heads of a rat and a rabbit, are neither the Dalai
Lama nor Rabiya Kadeer, so why should Chou be so afraid of them?</P>
      <P>They were brought out of China long before the United Nations Educational
Scientific and Cultural Organization  declared that museums should not acquire
artwork with unclear origins, and the two pieces should therefore not be
governed by it.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, China should be glad if Taiwan accepts the donations as it has
always claimed Taiwan is part of its territory. Isn't it better to have them in
its territory than overseas? Chou should be more considerate of China's leaders.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times: ECFA is padlock to shut Taiwan into China's fold</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou made a pitch for an ECFA trade pact with China yesterday
while receiving a group of American visitors.</P>
      <P>Ma told visitors that Taiwan's ties with China are thawing and economic
exchanges are increasing, adding that he hopes the amicable atmosphere will end
the two sides' cutthroat competition for allies on the international stage.</P>
      <P>The closer economic exchanges across the strait only hands China leverage
against Taiwan. Just as it tried to bend Kaohsiung City to its will by having
its tourists stay away from that city, Beijing can easily force Taiwan's
authorities to toe the line by flexing its economic muscle.</P>
      <P>Ma's diplomatic truce with China is actually making Beijing the country's
suzerain.</P>
      <P>We welcome peace with China but if the peace is obtained at the cost of Taiwan's
sovereignty and economic prosperity, it is nothing but surrender.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Dealing with China with confidence</P>
      <P>In response  to questions  from  an opposition  Democratic Progressive  Party
lawmaker,  Premier  Wu  Den-yih  said  his administration has refused a request
from Chinese donors that their donations should be used to rebuild the broken
Shuangyuan bridge in Pingtung County, because it would be "inappropriate."</P>
      <P>The premier's remarks were aimed at pleasing the DPP by showing that his
administration is not servile to China.</P>
      <P>We do not know whether the opposition will buy his trick, but it has exposed
that the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou is too cautious in its dealing
with China, looking for the catch in every move made by Beijing.</P>
      <P>China's request to chip in with a donation to rebuild the Shuangyuan bridge is
understandable, as every donor would prefer to see his donation put to use in
the place it is most-needed.</P>
      <P>It has also exposed the administration's self-imposed restraint in dealing with
China for fear of drawing fire from the DPP.</P>
      <P>However, the more cautious the KMT is in its engagement with China, the more
aggressive the DPP will be in checking it.</P>
      <P>This only bears out the administration's low confidence in itself while
associating with China.</P>
      <P>We hope the government will shed this cowardly image and face China with greater
confidence.</P>
      <P>United Daily News: Chaotic Year-end Elections</P>
      <P>The year-end election of magistrates and mayors is doomed to be chaotic as the
ruling Kuomintang has proven incapable of dealing with rebellious factions and
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party has failed to come up with any
vision that appeals to voters and can only hope that the KMT will self-destruct.</P>
      <P>President Ma's administration has a big head but feeble feet because Ma can lead
the country out of a political impasse with China but cannot tame local
factions.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile the DPP is a party with feet but no head because it can only fish in
muddy political waters but cannot lead the country with a clear vision for the
future.</P>
      <P>So the KMT is incapable of governing at the local level while the DPP is
incapable of ruling the country.</P>
      <P>Unless the two parties can reform themselves and alter this situation, the year-
end elections will be meaningless for local voters.</P>

      <P>Information and communication technology (ICT) can facilitate lives in urban and
rural areas and help create a lifestyle of health and sustainability (LOHAS),
participants at a seminar on ICT applications said Friday.</P>
      <P>Pundits and experts from Taiwan and Europe discussed how to use ICT to promote
urban renewal and industrial development at the conference, called The
International Seminar on ICT Utilisation for Regional Revitalization.</P>
      <P>Ke Jyh-sheng, the CEO of event co-sponsor the Institute for Information
Technology (III) , said ICT plays a key role in regional development, local
business development, niche industries and leisure farms.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Mei-li, another III official in charge of research to support industry,
said if good use is made of ICT, the gap between urban and rural areas can be
narrowed, enticing young men to return to their hometowns and helping preserve
niche industries.</P>
      <P>She noted that in Japan, South Korea and Thailand, governments have used ICT to
engage in regional renewal.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yun-lung, director-general of the Department of Commerce under the Ministry
of Economic Affairs, said the ministry has already begun to promote the concept
of LOHAS in Sinshe, Taichung County.</P>
      <P>The ministry will next target Taipei's Ximending, Lugang in Changhua County, and
Hengchun in Pingtung County, hoping to achieve sustainable development in the
three areas and maintain their local features.</P>
      <P>Sascha Haselmayer, the CEO of the seminar's other co-sponsor, the nonprofit
Living Labs Global, lauded Taipei City's hotline 1999 as a unique example of
using ICT to improve the lives of Taipei's residents.</P>
      <P>Haselmayer also introduced to participants ICT used in urban life and regional
development, such as using mobile phones to inquire about available parking

    <HEADLINE>Gene explaining rice's flood tolerant properties discovered</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese scientist at Academia Sinica, Taiwan's most prestigious research
institute, announced Friday that her research team has identified the gene --
CIPK15 (CBL-interacting protein kinase) -- that explains why rice can germinate
and grow under water.</P>
      <P>"The CIPK15 gene has been found as the key that guarantees rice's flood tolerant
qualities, " said Yu Shu-may, a researcher at Academia Sinica's Institute of
Molecular Biology, at a news conference to introduce the new finding.</P>
      <P>The gene is the reason why 80 percent of the world's rice is traditionally
planted in submerged fields, saving the need to kill weeds and use pesticides,
Yu noted.</P>
      <P>She expressed the hope that the discovery behind rice's growth can help human
beings cultivate more crops that are resistant to floods, drought, salt, and hot
or cold temperatures at a time when extreme weather conditions resulting from
global climate change have become common and often lead to diminished crop
yields.</P>
      <P>Yu's study was selected as the cover story in the current issue of the journal
Science Signaling.</P>
      <P>Lee Kuo-wei, the first author of the paper and the prime contributor to the rice
genomics study, said the team's research found that rice is the only crop that
can survive in flooded fields thanks to the CIPK15 gene.</P>
      <P>Most plants die when submerged in water because the diffusion of oxygen is
limited,  restricting  aerobic metabolism and energy production.</P>
      <P>But rice seeds, when plunged under water, signal to the CIPK15 gene that an
oxygen shortage exists, triggering SnRKIA, a multiple functional protein, to
produce amylolytic enzymes that are then transformed into sugar.</P>
      <P>This gives the plants the energy they need to grow under water, Lee explained.</P>
      <P>After the rice seedlings emerge from the water, they can take in more oxygen,
allowing their roots to generate carbohydrates and energy under water based on
the same principles, he said.</P>
      <P>Other crops, such as barley, wheat and corn, or even weeds, cannot grow in water
through this mechanism because they lack the specific gene, he pointed out.</P>

      <P>A national flood control conference will open Oct. 11 in Taipei that will bring
together the heads of 21 cities and counties and a number of flood-control
experts to offer suggestions  on how to improve disaster prevention and relief
measures.</P>
      <P>The conference was originally scheduled for Oct. 4 but was postponed for a week
as Taiwan braced for Typhoon Parma, which approached the island that day, the
Water Resources Agency (WRA) said in a statement Friday.</P>
      <P>Torrential rains brought by seasonal typhoons and a powerful earthquake in
September 1999 have left soil layers on mountain slopes in Taiwan loose and
unstable, and, as a result, sloping hills around Taiwan are vulnerable to
disastrous landslides at any time.</P>
      <P>To counter that vulnerability, the agency decided to convene the meeting to
gather opinions on viable mudslide control and flood prevention mechanisms in
order to build a safer and more sustainable homeland, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The four main topics for the meeting will be post-Typhoon Morakot drainage and
reconstruction, measures to handle soil and sand buildups and disasters in
catchment areas, flood control and water usage strategies to cope with abnormal
weather conditions, and the overall management of catchment areas.</P>
      <P>Expected to attend are the chiefs and council speakers of 21 cities  and

      <P>Gila Almagor, an Israeli actress known as the "First Lady of Israeli Cinema,"
said Friday in Taipei that she is looking forward to bringing her
autobiographical stage play to local audiences, whom she believes will be
touched by her story despite linguistic and cultural barriers.</P>
      <P>"I've been traveling with the play for over 20 years now, performing either in
English or in Hebrew with translation. The response is always the same. People
are crying in the same place and laughing in the same place, " Almagor told the
Central News Agency in an interview.</P>
      <P>"If I can touch some people with my private story, it means a lot to me."</P>
      <P>Almagor was invited by the Taipei-based Israel Economic and Cultural Office
(ISECO) and Taipei National University of the Arts (TNUA) to take part in the
2009 Kuandu Arts Festival, which will feature an Israel Week Oct. 9-12.</P>
      <P>She will perform the one-woman play "The Summer of Avia" on Oct. 10 and 11 and
attend some of the screenings of her movies.</P>
      <P>The play, which is based on Almagor's autobiographical novel of the same title,
reprises her own stories as a Holocaust survivor looking for new life in Israel
and her relationship with her psychologically-troubled mother.</P>
      <P>While acting has been Almagor's main avocation, she also enjoys writing and
describes it as something she does to find her inner self.</P>
      <P>"Writing is something very intimate. It's between me and myself. I don't need an
audience or inspiration. This is fantastic, " she said.</P>
      <P>Visiting Taiwan for a second consecutive year, Algamor said that she was eager
to come again because after meeting Taiwanese audiences last year, she felt
their warmth and appreciation for her movies despite the language barrier.</P>
      <P>Describing Almagor as one of Israel's best ambassadors, ISECO Representative
Raphael Gamzou, said at a press conference Friday afternoon dedicated to Almagor
that her visit is also part of an Israeli cultural season that has been
organized by his office.</P>
      <P>The office, he said, attaches a great deal of importance to cultural exchanges,
among other activities, between Israel and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"It's very important for us to let Taiwanese friends to feel that our
representative office here is active in a multifaceted and multidimensional way.
We are definitely interested in developing exchanges and relationships at all
levels and all areas of potential progression," Gamzou said.</P>
      <P>"It is (also) very important to lay foundations for developing future dialogues
and future relationships with the future generations between Israel and Taiwan,"
he added.</P>
      <P>The Israeli cultural season, which kicked off Sept. 26 to mark Tel Aviv's

    <TEXT>
      <P>Weather Forecast Center Director Daniel Wu is determined to retire early despite
being repeatedly asked to stay on, his boss, Central Weather Bureau (CWB)
Director-General Shin Tzay-chyn, said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Shin said he tried to talk his colleague out of retiring early on a number of
occasions, but Wu, citing his new career plans, refused to budge from his
position.</P>
      <P>Shin added that Wu's post will be filled from within the CWB and said the new
appointee would be named in the next few days.</P>
      <P>Wu, acclaimed by Shin and his deputy Lin Hsiu-wen as "Taiwan's top weather
forecaster, " applied for retirement at the end of August after Typhoon Morakot
devastated southern Taiwan, nine years before the 56-year-old meteorologist's
legal retirement age.</P>
      <P>After serving at the CWB as a weather forecaster for 30 years, Wu said he could
no longer tolerate his professionalism being abused.</P>
      <P>He said he could not accept "the media's distortions of the bureau's weather
forecasts" and blamed television weathermen for often not clearly conveying CWB
information or making their own "exaggerated" comments.</P>
      <P>"Eventually, the weather bureau was blamed for all the mistakes," he complained.</P>
      <P>Wu was also frustrated by local TV reports that said CNN's weather forecasts
during Typhoon Morakot in early August were more accurate than the CWB's, and he
lamented that the public would rather trust foreign media than CWB's
professionalism.</P>
      <P>Severe public criticism over CWB's forecasts on Typhoon Morakot, which dumped
far more rainfall on Taiwan than the bureau predicted, as well as the Control
Yuan's launch of an investigation into its allegedly inaccurate forecasts,  were
seen as triggering  Wu's determination to retire early.</P>
      <P>The storm caused the worst flooding in Taiwan in 50 years and left more than 600
people dead and thousands homeless.</P>
      <P>"The public has often accused the bureau of not providing accurate forecasts
after Taiwan suffered serious damage from several typhoons in the past two
years. This kind of atmosphere can be frustrating for forecasters, " Shin said,
calling Wu's retirement "a loss for the country."</P>
      <P>Premier  Wu Den-yih  said Minister  of Transportation  and Communications Mao
Chi-kuo would try to persuade the experienced meteorologist to remain on the
job, but he acknowledged it would be difficult to persuade the retiring
forecaster to stay when he is determined to leave.</P>
      <P>Daniel Wu graduated from the Department of Atmospheric Sciences of National
Central University (NCU) and holds a master's degree in atmospheric science from
National Taiwan University. NCU has said it will invite Wu to return the school
to teach after he retires.</P>

parks are the three biggest draws to prospective home buyers, according to the
results of a market survey released Friday.</P>
      <P>In contrast, houses close to electrical substations, cemeteries and funeral
homes, and garbage dumps, are the biggest turnoffs when consumers look for a new
place to live, the survey's results showed.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by Taiwan Realty from Oct. 1-8, asked visitors to the
company's 200 outlets around Taiwan what they found to be the most attractive
neighborhood features in selecting a new house. A total of 653 valid samples
were collected in the poll.</P>
      <P>The results showed that 86 percent of the respondents cited proximity to mass
rapid transit lines as having the most appeal in choosing a new home's location.</P>
      <P>Some 76 percent of those surveyed mentioned being close to shopping districts
with famous department stores, such as the upscale Xinyi and Tienmu shopping
districts, as being a major draw.</P>
      <P>Urban parks are also attractive to potential home buyers, with 72 percent of the
respondents citing them as an important prerequisite in deciding where to live.</P>
      <P>"The figure indicates that local people have become more health conscious, as
urban parks are good places for recreation and exercise, " said Jhally Chiu, a
Taiwan Realty executive.</P>
      <P>In the same survey, 92 percent cited electrical substations or power
transmission pylons as structures that would deter them from buying homes
nearby.</P>
      <P>Cemeteries and funeral parlors were the second least appealing feature on the
list, with 80 percent saying they would not buy a home near such facilities.</P>
      <P>They were followed by garbage dumps, which 75 percent of respondents cited as
something they would not want in their new neighborhood.</P>

      <P>The 60-member Ya Yue court music orchestra of Nan Hua University has been
invited to perform at the 2009 Beijing Traditional Music Festival from Oct.
11-17, a spokesman of the university in Chiayi County said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chou Chun-yi, director of the music group,  spoke of the significance of
presenting Ya Yue (elegant music) in China since the genre was believed to have
been lost during the years of the Cultural Revolution and is no longer played by
any of China's 5,000 music groups.</P>
      <P>History books have recorded that Ya Yue was created by the Duke of Zhou of the
Zhou dynasty around 1,100 B.C. Incorporated with shamanistic and religious
rites, the repertoire was performed in ceremonies in honor of heaven and earth,
deities and ancestors, in a stately and solemn form.</P>
      <P>Chou said that when Nan Hua University formed the Ya Yue orchestra in August
1996, members of the orchestra had sought references from South Korea, where the
genre has been maintained and is still performed today.</P>
      <P>The Nan Hua Ya Yue orchestra will introduce this ancient court music with string
instruments, bells, and drums and in dances in two performances in Beijing, Chou
added.</P>

      <P>The central government collected NT$204.1 billion (US$6.34 billion) in net tax
revenues in September, down 5.9 percent from the same month a year earlier, the
Ministry of Finance (MOF) reported Friday.</P>
      <P>MOF officials attributed the decline mainly to a decrease in personal income
taxes collected in September, which were down NT$8.6 billion year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Tax offices across the country collected NT$79.3 billion in corporate income
taxes last month, NT$37.7 billion in personal income taxes, NT$42.3 billion in
sales taxes, and NT$11 billion in commodity taxes, according to MOF statistics.</P>
      <P>Securities transaction taxes hit NT$9.5 billion in September.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's tax revenue for the first quarter of the year was NT$245.3 billion
(US$7.34 billion), a falloff of NT$58.6 billion, or 19.3 percent, year-on-year
-- the biggest annual drop in the country's history, according to the Ministry

      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang estimated Friday that private
investment in Taiwan would reach NT$800 billion in 2009 and fall short of the
government's annual target by about 20 percent.</P>
      <P>The government had set a target of NT$1.001 trillion for new private investment
in 2009, Shih said at a meeting aimed at expanding investment organized by the
ministry.</P>
      <P>Citing figures compiled by the Industrial Development Bureau, Shih said that as
of the end of September this year, a total of 968 new investment projects worth
NT$459.8 billion had been initiated this year.</P>
      <P>The amount was lower than expected because of a more conservative attitude
adopted by many investors in coping with the global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>As the economy has taken a turn for the better, however, the Industrial
Development  Bureau has predicted that another 270 investment projects worth
NT$350 billion would be carried out by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The projected investment amount in the final quarter and new investment projects
initiated over the first nine months of this year will push total private
investment to NT$800 billion for the whole year, the bureau estimated.</P>
      <P>The new investment projects are mainly concentrated in the electronics and
information technology sectors, the bureau said.</P>

      <P>A 55-year-old man residing in Sinjhuang in Taipei County has become the 23rd
person to die of influenza A (H1N1) in Taiwan, the county's Public Health Bureau
reported Friday.</P>
      <P>The man died of the swine flu on Thursday, a day after being admitted to the
hospital due to breathing difficulties, according to a statement by the bureau.</P>
      <P>The statement said the man, who had suffered from chronic diseases, including
diabetes, hypertension and gout, and was a heavy smoker, developed a fever and a
cough on Oct. 2 after attending a party with family members and friends to
celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival.</P>
      <P>The patient had been tested for the H1N1 virus, but the test came back negative.
The Centers for Disease Control did not categorize the man as a severe H1N1 case
until Friday, the statement said.</P>
      <P>He was the fifth Taipei County resident killed by the H1N1 virus.</P>
      <P>None of his family members except for his son were infected with the flu virus,
the bureau said, and the son has shown signs of recovery after being treated
with the antiviral drug Tamiflu.</P>
      <P>As of Friday, the northern Taiwan county has reported 80 H1N1 cases, 13 of which
have been hospitalized, the statement said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipower begins installing smart meters for energy conservation</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) has begun installing smart meters for large
electricity consumers as part of its efforts to develop smart grids that will
help conserve energy, a company spokesman said Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on the opportunities and challenges of green industries,
Yang Chin-shih, head of Taipower's electricity research arm, said smart grids
deliver electricity from suppliers to consumers using digital technology to save
energy, reduce costs and increase realiability and transparency.</P>
      <P>"This modernized electricity network is being promoted by many countries around
the wolrd as a way to address energy independence, global warming and emergency
resilience issues, " Yang said.</P>
      <P>Installing smart meters is the first step toward developing a comprehensive
smart grid system.</P>
      <P>Once the advanced metering infrastructure is completed, consumers will be able
to easily understand how much electricity they are consuming through the smart
grid's energy management system and use the knowledge to plan and control their
power consumption to save energy and money, Yang said.</P>
      <P>The state-owned company will also be able to use the smart grid system to
differentiate its power rates and to easily detect damaged power transmission
lines to improve service quality, Yang said.</P>
      <P>To build up advanced metering infrastructure, Taipower has been installing smart
meters for its large customers in recent months.</P>
      <P>"Taipower now has 23,000 high-voltage electricity subscribers who consume a
combined  50 percent of our country's  total power consumption, " said Yang, who
expected the company will complete replacement of traditional meters with smart
ones for its ultra high-voltage power users by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Ultra high-voltage power users are those using 69kV power systems or higher.</P>
      <P>The company will then install smart meters for those using power systems of 11kV
or higher, with the completion date set for 2011, Yang said.</P>
      <P>Smart meter replacement for household electricity users will be completed by
2013, Yang said.</P>
      <P>According to estimates released by the quasi-official Institute for Information
Industry (III), the development of a smart grid will generate NT$60 billion in
business opportunities that have already caught the eye of many local and
foreign companies.</P>
      <P>Yang said Taipower is using smart meters jointly developed by Tatung Co. and the
III as part of its efforts to help the high-tech sector take root in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's ruling party said Friday that it will discipline all party members who
intend to run in year-end local elections in defiance of the party's nominating
process.</P>
      <P>A total of eight Kuomintang (KMT) members have officially registered with
election committees to run for county magistrate in six counties around Taiwan
in "three-in-one" elections scheduled to take place on Dec. 5.</P>
      <P>The KMT has already formally nominated candidates to compete in those races and
is worried that splits in its ranks could lead to defeat on election day.</P>
      <P>Voters will not only be electing new county and city chiefs but also township
chiefs, and county and city councilors.</P>
      <P>Among the eight members are Hualien County Deputy Magistrate Cheng Chi-ming and
Legislator Fu Kung-chi, who will both vie for the Hualien County magistrate job,
and former legislator Wu Cheng-tien and writer Hsu Ching-min, who will compete

      <P>Others who will run for county magistrate in their respective areas after being
shunned by the party are Chiayi County Councilor Lin Sheng-fen, Hsinchu County

      <P>Several types of performing arts that have been recognized as cultural heritages
will be staged in Taiwan during the National Day holiday, organizers of the
events said Friday.</P>
      <P>One of them will be kabuki, a type of classical Japanese dance-drama  that
integrates song,  dance and skills that was proclaimed by the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 2005 as one of the
masterpieces of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity.</P>
      <P>A kabuki lecture and demonstration presented by Shochiku Company Limited is
scheduled for Oct. 10-11 at the Recital Hall of the National Theater and Concert
Hall in Taipei, officials at the National Chiang Kai-shek Cultural Center said.</P>
      <P>The event, which includes a short performance and a lecture, will take the
audience into the mysterious and breathtaking world of kabuki, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the 2009 Asia-Pacific Traditional Arts Festival being held at the
National Headquarters of Taiwan Traditional Arts in Yilan County will feature
Khmer shadow theater and Khmer classical dance by Cambodia's Sovanna Phum Art
Association Oct. 10-11.</P>
      <P>Khmer shadow theater, also known as the royal ballet of Cambodia, was proclaimed
a cultural heritage by UNESCO in 2003.</P>
      <P>The art form, which narrowly escaped extinction in the 1970s, has been closely
associated with the Khmer court for more than 1,000 years. Performances would
traditionally accompany royal ceremonies and observances such as coronations,
marriages, funerals or Khmer holidays.</P>
      <P>Khmer shadow theater, or the sbek thom, was added to the UNESCO list of cultural
heritages in 2005.</P>
      <P>The sbek thom features two-meter tall, non-articulated puppets made of leather
openwork. The performances traditionally take place at night outdoors. The
shadows of the puppets' silhouettes are projected onto a white screen set up in
front of a large fire or, nowadays, projectors.</P>
      <P>Also taking part in the arts festival is the Mandalay Marionettes Theater from

    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) on Friday nixed a proposal
by the Department of Health (DOH) to impose a health tax on betel nut, saying it
would hurt the livelihoods of grassroots residents.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus whip Lu Hsueh-chang praised the DOH's tax proposal, aimed
at protecting the public's health over the long run, as a good idea.</P>
      <P>But he said that the livelihood of the public, particularly those at the
grassroots level, should be taken into consideration when a new law is being
initiated.</P>
      <P>"Currently it is imappropriate and unnecessary to impose a betel nut tax," Lu
argued.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 1.37 million betel nut chewers in Taiwan, according to
the latest DOH survey.</P>
      <P>Betel nuts, grown on over 50,000 hectares of land around the country, are
currently the country's biggest cash crop. In 2008, betel nut production was
worth NT$8.6 billion, more than double the production value of rice, according
to the Council of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>DOH Minister Yaung Chih-liang said at the Legislative Yuan Thursday that the DOH
was studying the feasibility of levying a health tax on betel nuts to reduce
consumption and generate tax revenue.</P>
      <P>The minister supported the idea of imposing a tax of NT$0.13 per betel nut, or
NT$2-3 for each pack of 20 nuts on average.</P>
      <P>"We've been collecting cigarette taxes with success, " Yaung said to
legislators. "Why not levy a tax or surtax on betel nut consumption?"</P>
      <P>He acknowledged at the time, however, that it would be very difficult to collect
such a tax, as betel nuts are not sold in packs like cigarettes.</P>
      <P>Chao Kun-yu, a Bureau of Health Promotion deputy director, added that selling
agricultural products like betel nuts does not require a business license, and
he said it would be unlikely that betel nut vendors would be told to count the
nuts they sell and tax them individually.</P>
      <P>Chao said that before the betel nut tax plan matures, the DOH will accelerate
its oral cancer screening campaign, as 90 percent of Taiwan's oral and
esophageal cancer patients have chewed betel nuts.</P>
      <P>Citing foreign medical reports indicating that effective oral cancer screening
contributes to lowering fatalities by 43 percent, Chao said efforts to screen
for oral cancer should take precedence over the tax legislation.</P>
      <P>Some 5,000 new oral cancer cases are reported in the country each year, with
2,300 people losing their lives to the disease.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A former aide to the late Communist Party of China (CPC) boss Zhao Ziyang
recently spoke highly of the current form of democracy in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Bao Tong, who was expelled by the Communist Party after the Tiananmen Massacre
on June 4, 1989, and was sentenced to seven years in jail for "leaking national
secrets, " praised Taiwan's system in an essay marking Taiwan's National Day
celebration.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, where there is no socialism, it is possible to ferret out corruption
openly, Bao said in his essay posted on Free Radio Asia's Web site.</P>
      <P>Bao said that while Taiwan had long since reversed the official verdict on a
massacre of demonstrators by Kuomintang (KMT) troops in 1947, in China to this
day, no one dares mention "June 4, 1989."</P>
      <P>"Courts in Taiwan have the power to pass judgment on high-ranking officials, "
wrote Bao.</P>
      <P>In contrast, "on the mainland, where we enjoy the benefits of the dictatorship
of the proletariat, masses of people who turn out to protest at corruption are
suppressed as troublemakers, " he wrote, referring to the 1989 military
crackdown on student-led protests on Tiananmen Square.</P>
      <P>While China on Oct. 1 held the largest-ever parade in Beijing to celebrate its
60th founding anniversary, Bao said the last 60 years of glorious Communist rule
contained "a big lie."</P>
      <P>"In the first 30 years, tens of millions either died of starvation or were
'harrassed'  to death under the banner of revolution, " said Bao, who has been
kept under house arrest in Beijing since his release from jail on May 1996.</P>
      <P>"In the second 30 years, anyone standing up for civil and constitutional rights,
for religious freedom, or for ethnic autonomy has been declared an enemy of the
people en masse, all in the name of stability."</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Hong Kong Apple Daily, Bao said the power struggle
within the Communist Party continues to this day. He argued that former Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, who retired in late 2002 as CPC general secretary,
continues to hold great influence in the party and is "bullying" incumbent
President Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>He said this was evidenced by the appearance of Jiang alongside his successor Hu
atop the Tiananmen Squre rostrum to review the military parade marking China's
60th founding anniversary.</P>
      <P>According to Bao, Jiang got much more attention from China's state-run media
during the parade and the ensuing party in the evening than any other Chinese
leader except for Hu.</P>

      <P>We have to point out that Chou rejected the donated pieces more out of fear of
offending China than on ethical grounds.</P>
      <P>The bronze sculptures, the heads of a rat and a rabbit, are neither the Dalai
Lama nor Rabiya Kadeer, so why should Chou be so afraid of them?</P>
      <P>They were brought out of China long before the United Nations Educational
Scientific and Cultural Organization  declared that museums should not acquire
artwork with unclear origins, and the two pieces should therefore not be
governed by it.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, China should be glad if Taiwan accepts the donations as it has
always claimed Taiwan is part of its territory. Isn't it better to have them in
its territory than overseas? Chou should be more considerate of China's leaders.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times: ECFA is padlock to shut Taiwan into China's fold</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou made a pitch for an ECFA trade pact with China yesterday
while receiving a group of American visitors.</P>
      <P>Ma told visitors that Taiwan's ties with China are thawing and economic
exchanges are increasing, adding that he hopes the amicable atmosphere will end
the two sides' cutthroat competition for allies on the international stage.</P>
      <P>The closer economic exchanges across the strait only hands China leverage
against Taiwan. Just as it tried to bend Kaohsiung City to its will by having
its tourists stay away from that city, Beijing can easily force Taiwan's
authorities to toe the line by flexing its economic muscle.</P>
      <P>Ma's diplomatic truce with China is actually making Beijing the country's
suzerain.</P>
      <P>We welcome peace with China but if the peace is obtained at the cost of Taiwan's
sovereignty and economic prosperity, it is nothing but surrender.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Dealing with China with confidence</P>
      <P>In response  to questions  from  an opposition  Democratic Progressive  Party
lawmaker,  Premier  Wu  Den-yih  said  his administration has refused a request
from Chinese donors that their donations should be used to rebuild the broken
Shuangyuan bridge in Pingtung County, because it would be "inappropriate."</P>
      <P>The premier's remarks were aimed at pleasing the DPP by showing that his
administration is not servile to China.</P>
      <P>We do not know whether the opposition will buy his trick, but it has exposed
that the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou is too cautious in its dealing
with China, looking for the catch in every move made by Beijing.</P>
      <P>China's request to chip in with a donation to rebuild the Shuangyuan bridge is
understandable, as every donor would prefer to see his donation put to use in
the place it is most-needed.</P>
      <P>It has also exposed the administration's self-imposed restraint in dealing with
China for fear of drawing fire from the DPP.</P>
      <P>However, the more cautious the KMT is in its engagement with China, the more
aggressive the DPP will be in checking it.</P>
      <P>This only bears out the administration's low confidence in itself while
associating with China.</P>
      <P>We hope the government will shed this cowardly image and face China with greater
confidence.</P>
      <P>United Daily News: Chaotic Year-end Elections</P>
      <P>The year-end election of magistrates and mayors is doomed to be chaotic as the
ruling Kuomintang has proven incapable of dealing with rebellious factions and
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party has failed to come up with any
vision that appeals to voters and can only hope that the KMT will self-destruct.</P>
      <P>President Ma's administration has a big head but feeble feet because Ma can lead
the country out of a political impasse with China but cannot tame local
factions.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile the DPP is a party with feet but no head because it can only fish in
muddy political waters but cannot lead the country with a clear vision for the
future.</P>
      <P>So the KMT is incapable of governing at the local level while the DPP is
incapable of ruling the country.</P>
      <P>Unless the two parties can reform themselves and alter this situation, the year-
end elections will be meaningless for local voters.</P>

      <P>Information and communication technology (ICT) can facilitate lives in urban and
rural areas and help create a lifestyle of health and sustainability (LOHAS),
participants at a seminar on ICT applications said Friday.</P>
      <P>Pundits and experts from Taiwan and Europe discussed how to use ICT to promote
urban renewal and industrial development at the conference, called The
International Seminar on ICT Utilisation for Regional Revitalization.</P>
      <P>Ke Jyh-sheng, the CEO of event co-sponsor the Institute for Information
Technology (III) , said ICT plays a key role in regional development, local
business development, niche industries and leisure farms.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Mei-li, another III official in charge of research to support industry,
said if good use is made of ICT, the gap between urban and rural areas can be
narrowed, enticing young men to return to their hometowns and helping preserve
niche industries.</P>
      <P>She noted that in Japan, South Korea and Thailand, governments have used ICT to
engage in regional renewal.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yun-lung, director-general of the Department of Commerce under the Ministry
of Economic Affairs, said the ministry has already begun to promote the concept
of LOHAS in Sinshe, Taichung County.</P>
      <P>The ministry will next target Taipei's Ximending, Lugang in Changhua County, and
Hengchun in Pingtung County, hoping to achieve sustainable development in the
three areas and maintain their local features.</P>
      <P>Sascha Haselmayer, the CEO of the seminar's other co-sponsor, the nonprofit
Living Labs Global, lauded Taipei City's hotline 1999 as a unique example of
using ICT to improve the lives of Taipei's residents.</P>
      <P>Haselmayer also introduced to participants ICT used in urban life and regional
development, such as using mobile phones to inquire about available parking
spaces and pay for parking fees.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Gene explaining rice's flood tolerant properties discovered</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese scientist at Academia Sinica, Taiwan's most prestigious research
institute, announced Friday that her research team has identified the gene --
CIPK15 (CBL-interacting protein kinase) -- that explains why rice can germinate
and grow under water.</P>
      <P>"The CIPK15 gene has been found as the key that guarantees rice's flood tolerant
qualities, " said Yu Shu-may, a researcher at Academia Sinica's Institute of
Molecular Biology, at a news conference to introduce the new finding.</P>
      <P>The gene is the reason why 80 percent of the world's rice is traditionally
planted in submerged fields, saving the need to kill weeds and use pesticides,
Yu noted.</P>
      <P>She expressed the hope that the discovery behind rice's growth can help human
beings cultivate more crops that are resistant to floods, drought, salt, and hot
or cold temperatures at a time when extreme weather conditions resulting from
global climate change have become common and often lead to diminished crop
yields.</P>
      <P>Yu's study was selected as the cover story in the current issue of the journal
Science Signaling.</P>
      <P>Lee Kuo-wei, the first author of the paper and the prime contributor to the rice
genomics study, said the team's research found that rice is the only crop that
can survive in flooded fields thanks to the CIPK15 gene.</P>
      <P>Most plants die when submerged in water because the diffusion of oxygen is
limited,  restricting  aerobic metabolism and energy production.</P>
      <P>But rice seeds, when plunged under water, signal to the CIPK15 gene that an
oxygen shortage exists, triggering SnRKIA, a multiple functional protein, to
produce amylolytic enzymes that are then transformed into sugar.</P>
      <P>This gives the plants the energy they need to grow under water, Lee explained.</P>
      <P>After the rice seedlings emerge from the water, they can take in more oxygen,
allowing their roots to generate carbohydrates and energy under water based on
the same principles, he said.</P>
      <P>Other crops, such as barley, wheat and corn, or even weeds, cannot grow in water
through this mechanism because they lack the specific gene, he pointed out.</P>

      <P>A national flood control conference will open Oct. 11 in Taipei that will bring
together the heads of 21 cities and counties and a number of flood-control
experts to offer suggestions  on how to improve disaster prevention and relief
measures.</P>
      <P>The conference was originally scheduled for Oct. 4 but was postponed for a week
as Taiwan braced for Typhoon Parma, which approached the island that day, the
Water Resources Agency (WRA) said in a statement Friday.</P>
      <P>Torrential rains brought by seasonal typhoons and a powerful earthquake in
September 1999 have left soil layers on mountain slopes in Taiwan loose and
unstable, and, as a result, sloping hills around Taiwan are vulnerable to
disastrous landslides at any time.</P>
      <P>To counter that vulnerability, the agency decided to convene the meeting to
gather opinions on viable mudslide control and flood prevention mechanisms in
order to build a safer and more sustainable homeland, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The four main topics for the meeting will be post-Typhoon Morakot drainage and
reconstruction, measures to handle soil and sand buildups and disasters in
catchment areas, flood control and water usage strategies to cope with abnormal
weather conditions, and the overall management of catchment areas.</P>
      <P>Expected to attend are the chiefs and council speakers of 21 cities  and
counties,  members  of flood  control  committees, representatives of disaster
affected areas, legislators, Control Yuan members, academics and experts, and

the opening ceremony of the Peace Memorial Park on Oct. 25.</P>
      <P>The park administration said the seminar will be held to pay tribute to the

      <P>Analysts and experts will also analyze and evaluate the successes and failures
of the battle to serve as a lesson for the pursuit of peace for peoples on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait, according to the park administration.</P>
      <P>The administration's presentation of a new book commemorating the battle's 60th

      <P>The Battle of Guningtou began on Oct. 25, 1949, when Chinese communist warships
carrying over 10,000 troops landed on Guningtou, located on the northwestern tip
of the main island of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>After three days of battle, on Oct. 27, the nationalist army defeated the
communists after forcing the surrender of thousands of communist troops.</P>

      <P>Gila Almagor, an Israeli actress known as the "First Lady of Israeli Cinema,"
said Friday in Taipei that she is looking forward to bringing her
autobiographical stage play to local audiences, whom she believes will be
touched by her story despite linguistic and cultural barriers.</P>
      <P>"I've been traveling with the play for over 20 years now, performing either in
English or in Hebrew with translation. The response is always the same. People
are crying in the same place and laughing in the same place, " Almagor told the
Central News Agency in an interview.</P>
      <P>"If I can touch some people with my private story, it means a lot to me."</P>
      <P>Almagor was invited by the Taipei-based Israel Economic and Cultural Office
(ISECO) and Taipei National University of the Arts (TNUA) to take part in the
2009 Kuandu Arts Festival, which will feature an Israel Week Oct. 9-12.</P>
      <P>She will perform the one-woman play "The Summer of Avia" on Oct. 10 and 11 and
attend some of the screenings of her movies.</P>
      <P>The play, which is based on Almagor's autobiographical novel of the same title,
reprises her own stories as a Holocaust survivor looking for new life in Israel
and her relationship with her psychologically-troubled mother.</P>
      <P>While acting has been Almagor's main avocation, she also enjoys writing and
describes it as something she does to find her inner self.</P>
      <P>"Writing is something very intimate. It's between me and myself. I don't need an
audience or inspiration. This is fantastic, " she said.</P>
      <P>Visiting Taiwan for a second consecutive year, Algamor said that she was eager
to come again because after meeting Taiwanese audiences last year, she felt
their warmth and appreciation for her movies despite the language barrier.</P>
      <P>Describing Almagor as one of Israel's best ambassadors, ISECO Representative
Raphael Gamzou, said at a press conference Friday afternoon dedicated to Almagor
that her visit is also part of an Israeli cultural season that has been
organized by his office.</P>
      <P>The office, he said, attaches a great deal of importance to cultural exchanges,
among other activities, between Israel and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"It's very important for us to let Taiwanese friends to feel that our
representative office here is active in a multifaceted and multidimensional way.
We are definitely interested in developing exchanges and relationships at all
levels and all areas of potential progression," Gamzou said.</P>
      <P>"It is (also) very important to lay foundations for developing future dialogues
and future relationships with the future generations between Israel and Taiwan,"
he added.</P>
      <P>The Israeli cultural season, which kicked off Sept. 26 to mark Tel Aviv's
centennial, will continue through the rest of the year and features a series of
art and cultural activities such as movie screenings, contemporary dance
performances, and concerts by noted Israeli artists.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Top weather forecaster determined to retire early: official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Weather Forecast Center Director Daniel Wu is determined to retire early despite
being repeatedly asked to stay on, his boss, Central Weather Bureau (CWB)
Director-General Shin Tzay-chyn, said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Shin said he tried to talk his colleague out of retiring early on a number of
occasions, but Wu, citing his new career plans, refused to budge from his
position.</P>
      <P>Shin added that Wu's post will be filled from within the CWB and said the new
appointee would be named in the next few days.</P>
      <P>Wu, acclaimed by Shin and his deputy Lin Hsiu-wen as "Taiwan's top weather
forecaster, " applied for retirement at the end of August after Typhoon Morakot
devastated southern Taiwan, nine years before the 56-year-old meteorologist's
legal retirement age.</P>
      <P>After serving at the CWB as a weather forecaster for 30 years, Wu said he could
no longer tolerate his professionalism being abused.</P>
      <P>He said he could not accept "the media's distortions of the bureau's weather
forecasts" and blamed television weathermen for often not clearly conveying CWB
information or making their own "exaggerated" comments.</P>
      <P>"Eventually, the weather bureau was blamed for all the mistakes," he complained.</P>
      <P>Wu was also frustrated by local TV reports that said CNN's weather forecasts
during Typhoon Morakot in early August were more accurate than the CWB's, and he
lamented that the public would rather trust foreign media than CWB's
professionalism.</P>
      <P>Severe public criticism over CWB's forecasts on Typhoon Morakot, which dumped
far more rainfall on Taiwan than the bureau predicted, as well as the Control
Yuan's launch of an investigation into its allegedly inaccurate forecasts,  were
seen as triggering  Wu's determination to retire early.</P>
      <P>The storm caused the worst flooding in Taiwan in 50 years and left more than 600
people dead and thousands homeless.</P>
      <P>"The public has often accused the bureau of not providing accurate forecasts
after Taiwan suffered serious damage from several typhoons in the past two
years. This kind of atmosphere can be frustrating for forecasters, " Shin said,
calling Wu's retirement "a loss for the country."</P>
      <P>Premier  Wu Den-yih  said Minister  of Transportation  and Communications Mao
Chi-kuo would try to persuade the experienced meteorologist to remain on the
job, but he acknowledged it would be difficult to persuade the retiring
forecaster to stay when he is determined to leave.</P>
      <P>Daniel Wu graduated from the Department of Atmospheric Sciences of National
Central University (NCU) and holds a master's degree in atmospheric science from
National Taiwan University. NCU has said it will invite Wu to return the school
to teach after he retires.</P>

      <P>Conveniently located mass rapid transit lines, shopping districts and urban
parks are the three biggest draws to prospective home buyers, according to the
results of a market survey released Friday.</P>
      <P>In contrast, houses close to electrical substations, cemeteries and funeral
homes, and garbage dumps, are the biggest turnoffs when consumers look for a new
place to live, the survey's results showed.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by Taiwan Realty from Oct. 1-8, asked visitors to the
company's 200 outlets around Taiwan what they found to be the most attractive
neighborhood features in selecting a new house. A total of 653 valid samples
were collected in the poll.</P>
      <P>The results showed that 86 percent of the respondents cited proximity to mass
rapid transit lines as having the most appeal in choosing a new home's location.</P>
      <P>Some 76 percent of those surveyed mentioned being close to shopping districts
with famous department stores, such as the upscale Xinyi and Tienmu shopping
districts, as being a major draw.</P>
      <P>Urban parks are also attractive to potential home buyers, with 72 percent of the
respondents citing them as an important prerequisite in deciding where to live.</P>
      <P>"The figure indicates that local people have become more health conscious, as
urban parks are good places for recreation and exercise, " said Jhally Chiu, a
Taiwan Realty executive.</P>
      <P>In the same survey, 92 percent cited electrical substations or power
transmission pylons as structures that would deter them from buying homes
nearby.</P>
      <P>Cemeteries and funeral parlors were the second least appealing feature on the
list, with 80 percent saying they would not buy a home near such facilities.</P>
      <P>They were followed by garbage dumps, which 75 percent of respondents cited as
something they would not want in their new neighborhood.</P>

investment in Taiwan would reach NT$800 billion in 2009 and fall short of the
government's annual target by about 20 percent.</P>
      <P>The government had set a target of NT$1.001 trillion for new private investment
in 2009, Shih said at a meeting aimed at expanding investment organized by the
ministry.</P>
      <P>Citing figures compiled by the Industrial Development Bureau, Shih said that as
of the end of September this year, a total of 968 new investment projects worth
NT$459.8 billion had been initiated this year.</P>
      <P>The amount was lower than expected because of a more conservative attitude
adopted by many investors in coping with the global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>As the economy has taken a turn for the better, however, the Industrial
Development  Bureau has predicted that another 270 investment projects worth
NT$350 billion would be carried out by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The projected investment amount in the final quarter and new investment projects
initiated over the first nine months of this year will push total private
investment to NT$800 billion for the whole year, the bureau estimated.</P>
      <P>The new investment projects are mainly concentrated in the electronics and
information technology sectors, the bureau said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and China are sure to hold a new round of negotiations by the end of this
year, said Zheng Lizhong, deputy director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of
China's State Council, on Friday.</P>
      <P>High on the agenda of the talks will be the signing of a memorandum of
understanding (MOU) on cross-strait cooperation in financial supervision and an
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA), Zheng said after attending a
ceremony marking the launch of a credit card themed with Taiwan's scenic spots.</P>
      <P>"Preparations (for the talks) have gone well, and the MOU is sure to be signed,"
Zheng said.</P>
      <P>Zheng did not say, however, whether the proposed ECFA, which would lay out a
framework to guide freer trade between Taiwan and China, would be signed during
the coming talks to be held in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  Straits  Exchange  Foundation  (SEF)  and China's Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) have held three rounds of talks
since President Ma Ying-jeou was inaugurated in May last year.</P>
      <P>During those talks, the two sides signed a total of nine agreements and issued a
joint statement on increasing cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>The two quasi-official bodies play the role of "negotiators" for their
respective governments in the absence of official contacts between Taiwan and
China.</P>

      <P>A 55-year-old man residing in Sinjhuang in Taipei County has become the 23rd
person to die of influenza A (H1N1) in Taiwan, the county's Public Health Bureau
reported Friday.</P>
      <P>The man died of the swine flu on Thursday, a day after being admitted to the
hospital due to breathing difficulties, according to a statement by the bureau.</P>
      <P>The statement said the man, who had suffered from chronic diseases, including
diabetes, hypertension and gout, and was a heavy smoker, developed a fever and a
cough on Oct. 2 after attending a party with family members and friends to
celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival.</P>
      <P>The patient had been tested for the H1N1 virus, but the test came back negative.
The Centers for Disease Control did not categorize the man as a severe H1N1 case
until Friday, the statement said.</P>
      <P>He was the fifth Taipei County resident killed by the H1N1 virus.</P>
      <P>None of his family members except for his son were infected with the flu virus,
the bureau said, and the son has shown signs of recovery after being treated
with the antiviral drug Tamiflu.</P>
      <P>As of Friday, the northern Taiwan county has reported 80 H1N1 cases, 13 of which
have been hospitalized, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) reported Friday morning

    <HEADLINE>Taipower begins installing smart meters for energy conservation</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  9 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) has begun installing smart meters for large
electricity consumers as part of its efforts to develop smart grids that will
help conserve energy, a company spokesman said Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on the opportunities and challenges of green industries,
Yang Chin-shih, head of Taipower's electricity research arm, said smart grids
deliver electricity from suppliers to consumers using digital technology to save
energy, reduce costs and increase realiability and transparency.</P>
      <P>"This modernized electricity network is being promoted by many countries around
the wolrd as a way to address energy independence, global warming and emergency
resilience issues, " Yang said.</P>
      <P>Installing smart meters is the first step toward developing a comprehensive
smart grid system.</P>
      <P>Once the advanced metering infrastructure is completed, consumers will be able
to easily understand how much electricity they are consuming through the smart
grid's energy management system and use the knowledge to plan and control their
power consumption to save energy and money, Yang said.</P>
      <P>The state-owned company will also be able to use the smart grid system to
differentiate its power rates and to easily detect damaged power transmission
lines to improve service quality, Yang said.</P>
      <P>To build up advanced metering infrastructure, Taipower has been installing smart
meters for its large customers in recent months.</P>
      <P>"Taipower now has 23,000 high-voltage electricity subscribers who consume a
combined  50 percent of our country's  total power consumption, " said Yang, who
expected the company will complete replacement of traditional meters with smart
ones for its ultra high-voltage power users by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Ultra high-voltage power users are those using 69kV power systems or higher.</P>
      <P>The company will then install smart meters for those using power systems of 11kV
or higher, with the completion date set for 2011, Yang said.</P>
      <P>Smart meter replacement for household electricity users will be completed by
2013, Yang said.</P>
      <P>According to estimates released by the quasi-official Institute for Information
Industry (III), the development of a smart grid will generate NT$60 billion in
business opportunities that have already caught the eye of many local and
foreign companies.</P>
      <P>Yang said Taipower is using smart meters jointly developed by Tatung Co. and the
III as part of its efforts to help the high-tech sector take root in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>A total of eight Kuomintang (KMT) members have officially registered with
election committees to run for county magistrate in six counties around Taiwan
in "three-in-one" elections scheduled to take place on Dec. 5.</P>
      <P>The KMT has already formally nominated candidates to compete in those races and
is worried that splits in its ranks could lead to defeat on election day.</P>
      <P>Voters will not only be electing new county and city chiefs but also township

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 10 (CNA)
10/10/09  10:18:59</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is the full text of President Ma Ying-jeou's National Day address
titled "Growing amid Challenges, Progressing amid Reconstruction."</P>
      <P>Vice President Siew, Presidents of the Five Yuans, Presidential Advisors,
NationalPolicy Advisers, Ministers, Distinguished Guests, Fellow Countrymen:</P>
      <P>Good morning!</P>
      <P>Today is the 98th National Day of the Republic of China. In mid-August, it was
decided that this year we would forego the usual Double Tenth Day celebrations.
We simply are not in the festive mood necessary to celebrate this national day
as we mourn the deaths and disappearances of more than 700 compatriots during
the Typhoon Morakot disaster. It feels as if we had lost our own family members.
We can only hope that the spirits of the deceased rest in peace as we strive to
make our homeland more secure from such disasters and to ensure that such
tragedies never happen again. To the disaster victims and to all of our
citizens, we solemnly pledge to do our utmost in this regard.</P>
      <P>Effective Land Planning, Comforting Disaster Victims</P>
      <P>Recent years have seen anomalous  global climatic  changes accompanied by large-
scale disasters around the world, a trend particularly evident in the Asia-
Pacific region. Two months ago, Taiwan received a shocking education in the ways
of nature, from which we have learned painful lessons. We awakened to the
reality that, the earth is humanity's sole source of sustenance and security, so
we must be humble in dealing with nature and become rooted in the concept of
development based on harmony with the natural environment; and we must desist
from fighting against the land we live on.</P>
      <P>This year will be a turning  point in the work of land conservation. As soon as
possible, we must pass a national land planning bill that effectively puts
public safety first, takes human livelihood  as a central  concern,  and aims at
environmental sustainability as our ultimate goal. In particular, the bill
should prohibit or strictly limit the development of areas vulnerable to
disaster.</P>
      <P>In the future, reconstruction in disaster areas should take climate change into
consideration and should be integrated with ongoing waterway and land management
planning. When relocation of communities becomes necessary, we should ensure
that they are relocated from danger zones to safe areas, and in so far as
possible, the areas  to which they are relocated  must be within  the
administrative borders of their original villages, or at least within their
original rural township, so as to facilitate the continuity and sustainability
of original patterns of culture and livelihood following reconstruction.</P>
      <P>Another crucial lesson the Morakot disaster has taught us is that disaster
preparedness is more important than disaster relief. As long as disaster
preparedness work is carried out effectively, casualties and losses can be
greatly reduced. To that end, we have launched reforms of current disaster
preparedness systems and operations aimed at strengthening coordination and
communications between central and local governments, training and drilling
local government units in routine disaster preparedness measures, and
heightening citizens' awareness of the importance of disaster preparedness.</P>
      <P>Preparedness and rescue work has also been prioritized as a core mission of our
armed forces. As a matter of routine, the nation's five military zones will
carry out regular troop deployments in a manner that ensures they are prepared
for disasters. And when a possible disaster situation appears imminent, troops
will be deployed in advance to threatened areas so that they can be at the ready
to engage in rescue operations.</P>
      <P>In fact, before the Morakot disaster struck,  33 township magistrates, village
heads, police and fire chiefs, and landslide experts took decisive action to
evacuate and relocate some 9,100 people from 21 villages. Had they failed to
take such timely action, casualties would have increased by over 1,000. Thanks
to the heightened disaster preparedness of these heroes and their accurate
judgment of conditions, many lives were saved.</P>
      <P>In the course of Morakot disaster relief efforts, we have witnessed the
compassion of the people of Taiwan and the resilience of this land. In the wake
of the disaster, government agencies, citizens,  and charitable organizations
islandwide have devoted themselves to serving the needs of those in disaster
areas and made generous donations totaling some NT$17.8 billion [about US$550
million]. As for rescue and relief work, our military personnel performed over
560,000 person-missions; police, fire and public works departments  conducted
more than 410,000 person-missions;  and volunteers carried out in excess of
140,000 person-missions. They feared no danger or obstacle, working round-the-
clock to save lives, relocate victims, repair roads, bridges and levees, dredge
rivers, and clean up homes. These heroes rescued over 50,000 disaster victims.</P>
      <P>Among their ranks are soldiers, pilots, policemen, firefighters, village chiefs,
and volunteers. Regrettably, we are unable to acknowledge each of them by name,
and only a small number of them have received public recognition. The huge
majority remain unsung heroes, unassumingly laboring with all their hearts for
victims they look upon as family.</P>
      <P>Though floodwaters are heartless, it is in adversity that the strong solidarity
and vitality of the people of Taiwan shine through as we all cease to think of
ourselves and join hands in mutual help. It is this sentiment that gives us
faith that things will change for the better. We must harness this strength as
the motive power for Taiwan's ongoing progress.</P>
      <P>Braver with Every Challenge, Turning Crisis into Opportunity</P>
      <P>Since coming into office in May of last year, this administration has become
profoundly aware that the world is entering into an era of sudden change and
tremendous challenges. We have further come to see that the way in which a
country responds to them is key to its fortunes--even to its very survival. Last
year we were first hit by the global financial tsunami, in which international
banks went out of business, stock markets plummeted, and people panicked. Along
with these developments came stagnation of exports, economic slowdown, and
mounting unemployment.</P>
      <P>Our government immediately responded to these challenges with deliberate and
measured action. We stabilized the financial sector by fully guaranteeing all
bank deposits and cutting interest rates several times.  We boosted consumer
confidence  and stimulated consumption by launching programs to expand domestic
demand. We opened up new vistas for business by liberalizing restrictions on
economic interchange between Taiwan and mainland China, by opening Taiwan to
direct visits by mainland Chinese tourists, and by launching direct air, sea,
and postal links across the Taiwan Strait. And we sparked new momentum for
growth by designing policies to promote six emerging star industries and spur
the development of a diversified economy. In addition, we instituted policies
designed to bring about more efficient energy use and create a low-carbon
economy. Our actions on this front have reversed an eight-year period of
stagnation. The nation has saved 4.5 terawatt hours of power over the past year
alone, or the equivalent of a year's energy consumption by the 1.87 million
residents of Tainan County and Tainan City. Over this same time period, we have
also cut CO2 emissions by nearly 2.9 million tons, which is equal to 7,784 times
the annual CO2 absorption capacity of Da-an Forest Park, one of the largest
parks in Taipei.</P>
      <P>These measures  have enabled Taiwan to weather the global financial  tsunami and
advance toward our goal of becoming a low-carbon economy. Taiwan's ranking in
the World Economic Forum's competitiveness index has jumped five notches to 12th
place. And our ranking in the World Bank's Doing Business 2010 report has risen
to No. 46, up 15 notches.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the economic monitoring indicators of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development  have registered  an upbeat "yellow-blue light" for
three consecutive months,  and overall economic conditions in the third quarter
of this year have improved significantly in comparison with the second quarter.
This indicates that the economy has bottomed out and is now on the rebound.</P>
      <P>As the saying goes, "Break an arm, yet get up braver" [i.e., when the going gets
tough, the tough get going]. Taiwan has not been overwhelmed by the financial
turmoil. On the contrary, we are more confident and able to deal with external
challenges than ever.</P>
      <P>A few months ago, the outbreak of A(H1N1) novel influenza in Mexico raised fears
worldwide. Although it is not as lethal as SARS [severe acute respiratory
syndrome], we cannot afford to weaken our vigilance. Over the past five months,
our public and private epidemic-prevention  efforts--whether  in preparing
vaccines and medicines or promoting public health measures--have been on a par
with those undertaken by advanced countries. Both infection and fatality rates
have remained low, and it is gratifying to see that our citizens have been so
cooperative. Although the fall and winter seasons could see a higher incidence
of A(H1N1) influenza, we are fully prepared and confident that we will be able
to minimize its spread.</P>
      <P>Morakot will not be the last typhoon, nor will novel influenza A(H1N1) be the
last pandemic, to hit Taiwan. In facing potential natural disasters in the
future, we must anticipate a broader range of problems and take aggressive
measures to protect ourselves. If we prepare for every typhoon as a possible
Morakot and every outbreak of infectious disease as another SARS epidemic, then
harm can certainly be greatly reduced. Typhoon Parma is the first typhoon to hit
Taiwan since Morakot. With lessons learned from Morakot fresh in mind, 7,863
people were evacuated well in advance of Parma's arrival, evidencing much
improvement in our vigilance against potential disasters.</P>
      <P>Over the past few decades, the people of Taiwan have been toughened by
successive trials and tribulations. A widely shared awareness of the need to be
on guard against the unexpected has kept us from falling into complacency. This
mindset has enabled us to weather all sorts of hardships and adversities, which
is the fundamental reason why Taiwan has stood firm and steady. Now it is time
to take it up a notch. We must further heighten our awareness of the need for
disaster preparedness, and enhance our capacity for action.</P>
      <P>Rebuilding Cross-Strait Relations, Expanding our International Participation</P>
      <P>The past year has witnessed considerable  improvements  in relations between
Taiwan and mainland China. The prospect of peace across the Taiwan Strait
appears to be at hand. This progress is a result of efforts on both sides. Our
decision to move in this direction is in line with the hopes of the majority of
our people, and has also been very well received by the international community.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, working on the pragmatic basis of the "1992 Consensus, " we
have expanded the scope of cross-strait cooperation, and have achieved greater
mutual trust and good will, as evidenced by the signing of nine agreements
covering such topics as visits to Taiwan by mainland tourists, direct air, sea,
and postal links, food safety inspections, and cross-strait legal assistance. We
believe that there remains much work for us to tackle for the sake of the well-
being of our peoples, including negotiation of memorandums of understanding
(MOUs) on financial supervisory cooperation, and an economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>Cross-strait differences and concerns are rooted in historical factors that
cannot be overcome all at once. To achieve further peaceful development of our
relations, both sides must remain patient, face up to practical realities, and
move forward in a gradual, orderly manner, so as to build mutual trust and find
common ground amid our differences.</P>
      <P>A touching  and inspirational  development  in cross-strait interaction  was the
surge of relief donations  and practical assistance from Taiwan in response to
last year's Sichuan earthquake in mainland China. Taiwan's support for the
relief effort exceeded that of all other nations in terms of either monetary
value or number of volunteers. Then, in response to the disaster inflicted on
Taiwan by Typhoon Morakot in August, mainland China was no less generous in
offering material assistance and donations, likewise exceeding those of all
other nations. Such interaction, reflecting the feeling shared by both peoples
with common ethnic roots that "blood is thicker than water, " inspires  us to
look forward to future cross-strait developments with confidence and hope.</P>
      <P>At the same time, we are well aware that even as we actively pursue peaceful
development of cross-strait relations, some of our citizens worry that our
national sovereignty and interests might be harmed. We are willing to engage in
dialogue via all sorts of channels, including the Legislature and political
parties, in order to forge a public consensus on this government's mainland
China policy. Taiwan is a democratic society, and our foremost guiding principle
in addressing cross-strait issues is to safeguard our national sovereignty and
advance our people's welfare while welcoming the public's and the Legislature's
scrutiny. I am constantly mindful of this responsibility, and will do all in my
power to ensure that it is fulfilled.</P>
      <P>Improvement of cross-strait relations is beneficial to our foreign relations, as
all countries,  whether or not we have diplomatic ties with them, are all happy
to see an easing of cross-strait tensions. Most of them are also willing to
develop friendly relations with both Taiwan and mainland China. Over the past
year-plus period, we have been promoting a policy of "flexible diplomacy, " and
the two sides have demonstrated good will by refraining  from attempts to lure
away the other's diplomatic partners. Relations with our diplomatic partners are
gradually becoming more stable, and Taiwan's international status has been
steadily enhanced.</P>
      <P>Consequently, we have achieved breakthroughs in the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders' Meeting, the Government Procurement
Agreement under the World Trade Organization,  and participation in the World
Health Assembly. In May this year, the ROC ratified the United Nations' two 1966
human rights covenants--the International  Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights--
for which we have won praise in international human rights circles.</P>
      <P>With regard to our strategy for rejoining the United Nations system, since last
year we have abandoned futile confrontation and adopted as our priority goal
participation in the United Nations' specialized agencies and their activities
so as to substantively enhance  Taiwan's  participation  in and contributions
to the international community. These pragmatic, feasible approaches have
garnered widespread international affirmation and greatly improved Taiwan's
international image and status.</P>
      <P>Flexible diplomacy is a diplomacy of integrity, a humanitarian diplomacy, as
well as a soft-power diplomacy. It not only has expanded Taiwan's international
maneuvering room, but has won the respect of the international community. In
July and September of this year, our nation played host, respectively, to the
Eighth World Games in Kaohsiung and the 21st Summer Deaflympics in Taipei. In
both sporting events, our athletes turned in outstanding performances, garnering
record numbers of medals and finishing seventh and fifth, respectively, in the
medal count among the hundred-plus nations that took part in each event.
Moreover, people from everywhere were impressed with the meticulous preparations
carried out by the Taipei and Kaohsiung municipal governments, our central
government's strong support, our numerous volunteers' enthusiasm, and the
Taiwanese people's friendliness and hospitality.</P>
      <P>It is little wonder then, that Ron Froehlich, president of the International
World Games Association (IWGA) , publicly extolled the Kaohsiung World Games as
the most successful ever; while Donalda Ammoms, president of the International
Sports Committee for the Deaf (ICSD) , repeatedly praised the Taipei Summer
Deaflympics as the best-managed in the past 85 years. Moreover, my announcing of
the opening ceremonies of the two games in the capacity of president of the host
nation was also a first for the games. All of this goes to show that so long as
we have real strength and move in the right direction, the whole world will
cheer us on.</P>
      <P>Despite  the recent  dramatic  improvement  in cross-strait relations, we have
never overlooked the military threat posed by mainland China. We are indeed
actively pursuing peace across the Taiwan Strait, but we shall never sacrifice
Taiwan's national security.  Our insistence on the national defense strategy of
"effective deterrence and resolute defense" remains firm. We intend to
energetically develop a professional military based on recruitment of volunteers
to form a compact yet powerful defensive force to protect the security of
Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>Developing a Chinese Culture with Unique Taiwanese Character</P>
      <P>My dear friends, looking back over the 98 years of the Republic of China's
history inspires a welter of contrasting feelings. Except for the "golden
decade"  immediately  following  the Northern Expedition, the 38 years during
which the ROC government was based on the mainland was a period of incessant war
and chaos that rendered people destitute and rootless and allowed little
opportunity to put into practice the nation-building ideals of Dr. Sun Yat-sen.
Yet, over the six decades since the ROC government relocated to Taiwan, it has
succeeded in carrying out land reform, implementing universal education,
promoting economic growth, erecting a social welfare system and instituting
democratic constitutional government.</P>
      <P>After these 60 years of national development, Taiwan has a robust middle class,
enjoys an open and free media environment, and has a healthy civil society in
which environmental awareness has taken root, while community-building and
volunteerism have developed at a lively pace. Step by step, we have created a
Chinese culture with a unique Taiwanese character--a heritage belonging to all
of us and in which we all can take pride.</P>
      <P>During the past six decades, the histories and cultures of the Republic of China
and Taiwan have become thoroughly intertwined. In this context, "Taiwan spirit"
is not a vapid slogan, but is concretely embodied in the values and character of
those who have struggled for this land.</P>
      <P>The many individuals  who have held  resolutely  to their convictions over the
past century are exemplars of Taiwan spirit. Examples from the Japanese colonial
period include Lien Ya-tang, the historian who chronicled the early years of
Taiwan history, Chiang Wei-shui, a leading civil rights activist, Mona Rudao,
who fought against colonial oppression, and Lai He, a pioneer of Taiwanese
literature. Notable post-war figures include Chen Cheng, who promoted land
reform,  Li Kuo-ting and Sun Yun-suan,  who oversaw the transformation of
Taiwan's economy, and the many who struggled for freedom and democracy over the
decades through publications such as Free China magazine and Formosan magazine.</P>
      <P>Their spirit lives on today in the athletes who gave their all in the World
Games and Deaflympics; in the donors, volunteers and humanitarian organizations
that donated money and saved lives in the recent disaster; and in the bus
drivers Su Sheng-yu and Hou Wen-tien, whose actions in September saved the lives
of their passengers though they themselves died.</P>
      <P>Further, there are those who have taken Taiwan's culture onto the world stage,
such as members of the U-Theatre, the Performance Workshop and the Hsiao Hsi
Yuan Puppet Theater. Similarly, Ju Ming's sculptures,  Liao Shiou-ping's block
prints and Liu Kuo-sung's innovative Chinese ink paintings have won
international acclaim, securing for Taiwan a position of respect in the world of
art.</P>
      <P>Such examples of Taiwan spirit highlight the core values of the Taiwanese people
and inject Taiwan's vital, unique character into the deepest levels of Chinese
culture. "Taiwan spirit" has enriched the inner essence of Chinese culture while
giving sustenance to Taiwan. It has nurtured you and me, and it will nourish our
descendants. We should, then, treasure one another and walk forward hand in
hand, developing our Taiwan spirit and transmitting it to posterity.</P>
      <P>Inheriting the Past, Ushering in the Future</P>
      <P>In another 400-plus days, the Republic of China will enter into its  one-
hundredth  year  as a nation.  The  cries  of those revolutionaries a century
ago still echo in our ears, and the ideals of the nation's founders still gleam
before our eyes. It is still our common vow to build a nation of the people, by
the people and for the people. And solidarity of the people, power to the
people, and prosperity of the people [Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the
People] remain the goals toward which we strive.</P>
      <P>In order to celebrate this grand day and to let upcoming generations know that
the Republic will always stand firm through whatever storm comes our way, and
that we will emerge shining brighter from every trial, I hereby announce on this
National Day the establishment of the "Republic of China Centennial Preparatory
Commission" chaired by Vice President Siew to coordinate the public and private
sectors in planning a year-long series of celebratory activities.</P>
      <P>My dear compatriots, our confidence is resolute and unwavering, our steps sure
and steady. We shall spare no efforts in carrying forward our various national
development programs, so as to lay a solid foundation for the Republic's
flourishing century to come. In closing, may our nation have great success and
prosperity! And may you and your families all be blessed with health, peace, and
happiness!</P>
      <P>Thank you!</P>

      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang estimated Friday that private
investment in Taiwan would reach NT$800 billion in 2009 and fall short of the
government's annual target by about 20 percent.</P>
      <P>The government had set a target of NT$1.001 trillion for new private investment
in 2009, Shih said at a meeting aimed at expanding investment organized by the
ministry.</P>
      <P>Citing figures compiled by the Industrial Development Bureau, Shih said that as
of the end of September this year, a total of 968 new investment projects worth
NT$459.8 billion had been initiated this year.</P>
      <P>The amount was lower than expected because of a more conservative attitude
adopted by many investors in coping with the global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>As the economy has taken a turn for the better, however, the Industrial
Development  Bureau has predicted that another 270 investment projects worth
NT$350 billion would be carried out by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The projected investment amount in the final quarter and new investment projects
initiated over the first nine months of this year will push total private
investment to NT$800 billion for the whole year, the bureau estimated.</P>
      <P>The new investment projects are mainly concentrated in the electronics and
information technology sectors, the bureau said.</P>

      <P>A 55-year-old man residing in Sinjhuang in Taipei County has become the 23rd
person to die of influenza A (H1N1) in Taiwan, the county's Public Health Bureau
reported Friday.</P>
      <P>The man died of the swine flu on Thursday, a day after being admitted to the
hospital due to breathing difficulties, according to a statement by the bureau.</P>
      <P>The statement said the man, who had suffered from chronic diseases, including
diabetes, hypertension and gout, and was a heavy smoker, developed a fever and a
cough on Oct. 2 after attending a party with family members and friends to
celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival.</P>
      <P>The patient had been tested for the H1N1 virus, but the test came back negative.
The Centers for Disease Control did not categorize the man as a severe H1N1 case
until Friday, the statement said.</P>
      <P>He was the fifth Taipei County resident killed by the H1N1 virus.</P>
      <P>None of his family members except for his son were infected with the flu virus,
the bureau said, and the son has shown signs of recovery after being treated

    <HEADLINE>Taipower begins installing smart meters for energy conservation</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  9 (CNA)

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) has begun installing smart meters for large
electricity consumers as part of its efforts to develop smart grids that will
help conserve energy, a company spokesman said Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on the opportunities and challenges of green industries,
Yang Chin-shih, head of Taipower's electricity research arm, said smart grids
deliver electricity from suppliers to consumers using digital technology to save
energy, reduce costs and increase realiability and transparency.</P>
      <P>"This modernized electricity network is being promoted by many countries around
the wolrd as a way to address energy independence, global warming and emergency
resilience issues, " Yang said.</P>
      <P>Installing smart meters is the first step toward developing a comprehensive
smart grid system.</P>
      <P>Once the advanced metering infrastructure is completed, consumers will be able
to easily understand how much electricity they are consuming through the smart
grid's energy management system and use the knowledge to plan and control their
power consumption to save energy and money, Yang said.</P>
      <P>The state-owned company will also be able to use the smart grid system to
differentiate its power rates and to easily detect damaged power transmission
lines to improve service quality, Yang said.</P>
      <P>To build up advanced metering infrastructure, Taipower has been installing smart
meters for its large customers in recent months.</P>
      <P>"Taipower now has 23,000 high-voltage electricity subscribers who consume a
combined  50 percent of our country's  total power consumption, " said Yang, who
expected the company will complete replacement of traditional meters with smart
ones for its ultra high-voltage power users by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Ultra high-voltage power users are those using 69kV power systems or higher.</P>
      <P>The company will then install smart meters for those using power systems of 11kV
or higher, with the completion date set for 2011, Yang said.</P>
      <P>Smart meter replacement for household electricity users will be completed by
2013, Yang said.</P>
      <P>According to estimates released by the quasi-official Institute for Information
Industry (III), the development of a smart grid will generate NT$60 billion in
business opportunities that have already caught the eye of many local and
foreign companies.</P>
      <P>Yang said Taipower is using smart meters jointly developed by Tatung Co. and the
III as part of its efforts to help the high-tech sector take root in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's ruling party said Friday that it will discipline all party members who
intend to run in year-end local elections in defiance of the party's nominating
process.</P>
      <P>A total of eight Kuomintang (KMT) members have officially registered with
election committees to run for county magistrate in six counties around Taiwan
in "three-in-one" elections scheduled to take place on Dec. 5.</P>
      <P>The KMT has already formally nominated candidates to compete in those races and
is worried that splits in its ranks could lead to defeat on election day.</P>
      <P>Voters will not only be electing new county and city chiefs but also township
chiefs, and county and city councilors.</P>
      <P>Among the eight members are Hualien County Deputy Magistrate Cheng Chi-ming and
Legislator Fu Kung-chi, who will both vie for the Hualien County magistrate job,
and former legislator Wu Cheng-tien and writer Hsu Ching-min, who will compete
to become the county magistrate in the frontline island of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Others who will run for county magistrate in their respective areas after being
shunned by the party are Chiayi County Councilor Lin Sheng-fen, Hsinchu County
Council chief Cheng Pi-chin, former legislator Chen Chen-sheng, who will run in
Nantou County, and Wu Fu-tung, a veterinarian who will run in Taoyuan County.</P>

      <P>For Lin Kuang-huei, the highlight of his evening when he returns home from his
job as principal of Taitung Girls' Senior High School in eastern Taiwan is
feeding his beloved grandson.</P>
      <P>Lin said he enjoys holding the baby and giving him a bottle, but sometimes, to
his distress, the child "rejects the milk."</P>
      <P>Lin said that after some investigation, he found that the baby is very
"particular" about the temperature of the milk. Once the milk cools, the child
refuses to have it and the bottle has to be reheated, but then the milk quickly
gets cool again, he added.</P>
      <P>"Usually the bottle has to be reheated several times during the process,
especially in winter," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin began to apply his mind to the problem, drawing on his background as a
graduate of the Department of Chemical Engineering at National Taiwan Normal
University.</P>
      <P>He eventually came up with the idea of a bottle that would automatically reheat
if the temperature of the contents drops by 0.5 degrees Celsius.</P>
      <P>At the urging of his family and friends, he applied for a patent and was
recently awarded a certificate for his invention.</P>
      <P>He said he was elated to obtain his very first patent, although it was achieved
"purely by accident."</P>
      <P>Based his own experience, he said, he encourages his students to observe things
around them and put their creativity to work in a practical way.</P>

      <P>The Taipei-based American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and the Taiwan Foreign
Correspondents Club (TFCC) are organizing a series of events that will be held
in mid-October to commemorate U.S. reporter Daniel Pearl, who was killed in the

    <HEADLINE>President pledges to seek continued improvement of cross-strait ties</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 10 (CNA)
10/10/09  13:45:41
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou pledged Saturday to seek continued improvement in
Taiwan's relations with China by gradually building trust.</P>
      <P>Addressing the issue in his National Day speech, Ma said the pragmatic approach
adopted by his administration in dealing with cross-Taiwan Strait issues has led
to greatly improved relations and expanded scope of cooperation between the two
sides over the past year.</P>
      <P>This is evidenced by the signing of nine agreements covering areas such as
visits to Taiwan by Chinese tourists, direct air, sea and postal  links,  food
safety  inspections  and cross-strait crime-fighting cooperation, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taiwan is seeking to sign memorandums of understanding on financial
supervisory cooperation and an economic cooperation framework agreement with
China, he noted.</P>
      <P>However, he pointed out, cross-strait differences and concerns are rooted in
historical factors that cannot be overcome all at once.</P>
      <P>"To achieve further peaceful development of our relations, both sides must
remain patient, face the practical realities and move forward in a gradual,
orderly manner, so as to build mutual trust and find common ground amid our
differences," Ma said.</P>
      <P>In the process, he stressed, the government will ensure that the country's
sovereignty and the people's well-being are protected.</P>
      <P>According to Ma,  the improvement of cross-strait ties is beneficial to Taiwan's
relations with other countries as well.</P>
      <P>Under his administration's policy of "flexible diplomacy, " the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait have refrained from attempts to lure each other's diplomatic
allies, which in turn has helped to stabilize Taiwan's relations with its
diplomatic allies and enhance its international status, Ma said.</P>
      <P>One of such examples, he said, was breakthrough achieved during the 2008 Asia
Pacific Economic forum in Peru, in which former Vice President Lien Chan was
allowed to attend the leaders meeting, which made him the highest-ranking former
ROC official ever allowed to take part in the annual summit.</P>
      <P>This year, Taiwan officially gained accession to the Government Procurement
Agreement and was invited to attend the World Health Assembly -- the World
Health Organization's decision-making arm -- as an observer for the first time,
Ma noted.</P>
      <P>In terms of Taiwan's progress in international sports events, Ma pointed out
that he was allowed to formally open the 2009 World Games in Kaohsiung in July
and the 2009 Summer Deaflympics in Taipei in September in his capacity as
president of the host nation, which was a first in both cases.</P>
      <P>"Flexible diplomacy is diplomacy of integrity, humanitarian diplomacy, as well
as soft-power diplomacy, " the president said. "It not only has given Taiwan
more space to maneuver internationally, but has also won the respect of the
international community."</P>
      <P>In line with this pragmatic  and flexible  approach,  the administration has
since last year abandoned futile confrontations in its bid to rejoin the United
Nations system and has revised its goals to give priority to participation in
U.N. specialized agencies and their activities, he noted.</P>
      <P>However,  despite the dramatic improvement  in cross-strait relations, Taiwan
has not overlooked the military threat posed by China and will stick to a
defense strategy of "effective deterrence and resolute defense" to protect the
country's security,  the president said.</P>

      <P>Several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Taiwan called on the government
and the rest of the world Saturday to take measures to abolish the death
penalty, as they marked World and European Day against the Death Penalty, which
also falls on Taiwan's National Day.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Alliance to End the Death Penalty (TAEDP), Human Rights Education
Curriculum and Instruction Team, Humanistic Education Foundation, Taiwan
Association for Human Rights, Chang Fo-chuan Human Rights Study Center of
Soochow University and the European Economic and Trade Office (EETO) in Taipei
made the appeal at a joint press conference.</P>
      <P>The groups called on the public to support a global "Appeal for the End of
Execution of Children in the World" initiated by World Coalition Against the
Death Penalty.</P>
      <P>A series of four workshops on the theme "See the Color of Life: Understanding
the Death Penalty" was being launched the same day to train a seed group of
social workers to raise awareness and widen debate on the issue, the NGOs said.</P>
      <P>"Support for abolition of the death penalty remains an individual decision. That
is why a better understanding of the issue is required in order to form an
opinion, " said Nicolas Baudouin, policy officer of the EETO's Political  and
Economic Affairs,  at the press conference.</P>
      <P>Lin Chia-fang, deputy convener of TAEDP, said that although abolition of the
death penalty is a very controversial issue, every human being, including
prisoners sentenced to death, has a right to to human dignity, which is the most
basic concept of human rights.</P>
      <P>Feng Chiao-lan,  executive director of Humanistic Education Foundation, said
that the death penalty is a tool used by governments to rule through fear.</P>
      <P>"When we take someone's life, we also trade our humanity," she added.</P>
      <P>As of the June 2009, 139 countries had joined the campaign against the death
penalty, 55 of which have abolished capital punishment since 1990.</P>
      <P>A "de facto moratorium" on the death penalty has been in effect in Taiwan since
2005 when the last execution was carried out.</P>
      <P>On May 14 this year, President Ma Ying Jeou signed the ratification of
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and International Covenant
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.</P>
      <P>Baudouin said these recent developments in Taiwan are positive, as they provide
a solid framework for the promotion of human rights and for further progress
toward abolishing the death penalty.</P>
      <P>World  Day  Against  the Death  Penalty  annually  gathers international non-
governmental  organizations,  bar associations, unions and local governments
from all over the world to lobby for the abolition of the death penalty.</P>
      <P>It was launched on Oct. 10, 2003 by the World coalition Against the Death
Penalty.</P>
      <P>In 2008, at least 2,390 people were executed in 25 countries, while more than
8,800 people were sentenced to death in 52 countries, the press release said,
adding that 93 percent of all known executions took place in five countries --
China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the U.S. and Pakistan.</P>

      <P>The British Trade and Cultural Office (BTCO) and Taiwan's Department of Health
(DOH) will jointly hold an international seminar in Taipei next week to share
their experience and expertise in the field of telecare.</P>
      <P>The seminar,  titled "The APEC Workshop for Innovation in Telecare, " will bring
together experts on long-term care/telecare from Taiwan, United Kingdom,
Australia and the United States Oct. 14-15, according to a BTCO newsletter.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will be represented by DOH Minister Yaung Chih-liang, Johnsee Lee,
chairman of the Telecare Industry Alliance Taiwan and president of the
Industrial Technology Research Institute, and other experts in the field, the
BTCO added.</P>
      <P>Malcolm Fisk, managing director of Insight Social Research Ltd. and Smart Isis
Ltd. and chairman of the U.K. Telecare Service Association (TSA), will talk
about telecare and telehealth service frameworks in the U.K. and EU.</P>
      <P>"The purpose of the workshop is to help foster an in-depth understanding of
current developments and future trends in the promotion of telecare worldwide,"
the DOH said on its Web site.</P>
      <P>"We also aim to achieve consensus among care providers, system developers, and
service managers on the use and development of telecare service, and to
encourage the different sectors to work toward expansion," it added.</P>
      <P>Statistics from the U.K. TSA show that 1.7 million people currently rely on
telecare service in the U.K., where 16 percent of the 61 million population is
over 65.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is also a fast-aging society, according to DOH 2008 statistics, which
show that 10.4 percent of the country's 23 million population is 65 or older. It
is estimated that the figure will double in 20 years and that by 2050, 33
percent of the Taiwan population will be over 65, according to the DOH.</P>
      <P>In order to meet the increasing demand on healthcare due to the aging
population, the DOH in 2007 initiated a pilot telecare project that provides
integrated and ubiquitous care services 24 hours a day by combining community
care, home care and institution care.</P>

      <P>Seven people were killed and 21 others injured when a tour bus traveling from
Taipei to Pintung careened off a bridge on a highway in Kaohsiung County early
Saturday, according to local police reports.</P>
      <P>The bus, carrying 27 passengers, collided with a pick-up truck on National
Highway No. 3 near Dashu township in Kaohsiung County, crashed into the
retaining wall and fell off the bride to drop more than 10 meters to slope
below, the police said.</P>
      <P>Seven people died in the crash, 21 were injured and the bus was severely
damaged, the police said.</P>
      <P>The 44-year-old bus driver and his 12-year-old son were among the injured. The
driver sustained a broken shoulder and injuries to his face, while his son's
chest was crushed, a hospital doctor reported.</P>
      <P>Five other people sustained major injuries, the police said.</P>
      <P>The driver of the pick-up truck that collided with the tour bus, said he
suspected that the bus was going too fast.</P>
      <P>A female passenger on the bus, Chen Ji-ru who received minor injuries, said that
most of the passengers were sleeping when the accident occurred at around 5: 35
a.m. She recalled hearing a lot of screaming and crying.</P>
      <P>"I was stuck under a seat, my arms really hurt... I kept hoping to see someone
coming to rescue us, but it felt like I was waiting forever," she said.</P>
      <P>The bus, which is registered in Taipei County, left the Taipei Bus Station
around midnight and was traveling south, carrying mostly workers from a company
and their friends to the ceremonial burning of the Donggang King Boat in

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou called for the enactment of a national land planning law
Saturday as part of the country's efforts to prevent a repeat of the Typhoon
Morakot disaster that occurred in August.</P>
      <P>The law should put public safety first and prohibit or strictly restrict the
development of areas vulnerable to disaster, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma made the call in his National Day address at a ceremony held inside the
Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>No National Day celebrations were held this year as the country is mourning the
loss of more than 700 lives during the typhoon that caused the worst flooding in
Taiwan in 50 years.</P>
      <P>Ma said with the painful lessons learned from Typhoon Morakot about the ways of
nature, climate change should be taken into consideration in reconstruction of
the disaster areas and in waterways and land management planning.</P>
      <P>Another lesson that Taiwan has learned from the typhoon is that disaster
preparedness is more important than disaster relief, Ma said.</P>
      <P>The government has therefore launched reforms of current disaster preparedness
systems and operations, focusing on strengthening coordination and
communications between central and local governments, training and drilling
local government units in routine disaster preparedness measures, and raising
citizens' awareness of the importance of disaster preparedness, he said.</P>
      <P>Also, preparedness and rescue work has been prioritized as a core mission of the
armed forces to ensure that they are always ready for rescue operations, Ma
said.</P>
      <P>According to the president, Morakot and the influenza A(H1N1) outbreak have been
two of the most severe challenges faced by Taiwan in recent years, but Morakot
will not be the last typhoon, nor will the H1N1 virus be the last pandemic, to
hit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"If we prepare for every typhoon as a possible Morakot and every outbreak of
infectious disease as another SARS epidemic, then the damage can certainly be
greatly reduced," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Fifty-four hopefuls register for city and county chief elections</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Fifty-four hopefuls have registered to run for 17 seats in the year-end mayoral
and magisterial elections, the Central Election Commission (CEC) said Friday,
the last day of registration.</P>
      <P>Except for Taoyuan County, where the Hakka party nominated one candidate, the
race will be among the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) , the main opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, and independents.</P>
      <P>In Kinmen County, which has a population of around 85,000, seven candidates will
vie for the magistrate seat, which is the highest number of hopefuls registered
to compete in any one area.</P>
      <P>The hopefuls in the race for magistrate of the offshore county include
independent candidate, former Legislator Wu Cheng-tien of the KMT, and the
party's nominee Lee Wuo-shi.</P>
      <P>In Taitung County, with incumbent Magistrate Kuang Li-chen agreeing to withdraw
from the race at the last minute, the KMT has been able to integrate its local
factions to make it a two-way battle with the DPP candidate.</P>
      <P>In Pingtung, Yunlin, Yilan counties, the KMT and DPP will each field one
candidate, which means that those seats will be a straight fight between the two
major parties.</P>
      <P>This is not the case in Hsinchu, Chiayi or Nantou counties, as there are four
aspirants in each of these counties. Former DPP Legislator Lee Wen-chung is
among the hopefuls in the Nantou County race, and incumbent DPP Legislator Chang
Hwa-kuan will make a bid in Chiayi.</P>
      <P>A three-way race will be run in Miaoli, Taoyuan, Hualien, Penghu, Lienchiang
(Matsu) and Changhua counties and in Chiayi, Keelung and Hsinchu cities.</P>
      <P>In Yunlin County, a recent survey by the United Daily News put the incumbent DPP
Magistrate Su Chi-feng far ahead the KMT's last-minute nominee Wu Wei-chi.</P>
      <P>In Hualien County, KMT Legislator Fu Kun-chi, who is running as an independent,
is leading the KMT's nominee Tu Li-hua and another independent candidate Deputy
County Speaker Chang Chi-ming, according to the newspaper poll.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a KMT official said Saturday that the party will mete out the
harshest possible punishment of expulsion to those who do not toe the party line
and insist on running as independents in elections.</P>
      <P>Juan Kang-meng, director of the KMT's Evaluation and Disciplinary Committee,
said that five KMT members, including Fu Kun-chi, Chang Chi-ming and Wu Cheng-
tian, will be in the first wave of expulsions when the KMT steering committee
meets Sunday.</P>
      <P>The year-end "three-in-one" elections for mayors and magistrates, city and
county councilors, and city and township heads will be held Dec. 5.</P>
      <P>As six cities and counties -- Taipei County, Taitung City and County, Tainan
City and County, Kaohsiung County -- will be upgraded or merged into
municipalities, the elections will be held in only 17 cities and counties.</P>
      <P>Both the KMT and the DPP have been going all out to gain the upper hand in the
elections as the polls will be the first crucial test of the government's
popularity since the harsh criticism it faced over the 700 deaths, massive
flooding and landslides that occurred during Typhoon Morakot in August.</P>
      <P>The elections are also seen as an indicator of the outcome of next year's
municipal elections and even the 2012 presidential election.</P>

      <P>A Chinese company is planning to send 9,500 of its employees and their family
members to Taiwan on a sightseeing tour in late October, but they will not visit
south of the island, according to Taiwan officials.</P>
      <P>Officials from the National Immigration Agency (NIA) and Tourism Bureau said
Saturday that the tourists from Beijing's Pro-Health company will be divided
into seven groups, the first of which will arrive in Taiwan via Hong Kong on
Oct. 30.</P>
      <P>The groups will have a choice of two tours during their seven-day visit,
according to the itinerary Pro-Health sent to the Tourism Bureau and NIA.</P>
      <P>One tour will take the visitors to central Taiwan immediately after arrival at
Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport. They will then travel to the Taipei area
in the north of the country before heading home.</P>
      <P>The second choice will allow the sightseers to tour Taipei, then drive down to
central Taiwan where they will visit Sun Moon Lake and other popular tourist
attractions there.</P>
      <P>The travel plans do not include the southern part of Taiwan, the officials said,
but did not give a reason for the exclusion. In March, when over 10,000
employees and sale representatives of the Chinese branch of the international
marketing company Amway came to Taiwan on a cruise, they did not visit southern
Taiwan either.</P>
      <P>At the time, the company said that as the groups had only three days to tour
Taiwan, it would be impractical to include Kaohsiung Harbor in the itinerary.</P>
      <P>Southern Taiwan is known to be a stronghold of pro-independent activists and the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DDP).</P>
      <P>A recent decision by the DPP-led Kaohsiung City government to screen a
documentary about exiled Uighur rights activist Rebiya Kadeer at its October
film festival triggered a wave of cancellations to the southern city by Chinese
tourists.</P>

      <P>Far Eastern Air Transport (FAT) has re-started flight simulation training for
its pilots in preparation for the resumption  of operations  under new
management,  the Taipei-based aviation company said Saturday.</P>
      <P>After Huafu Enterprise Co.,  Ltd. took over the company's management on Oct.  5,
the group immediately  embarked on a restructuring plan, starting with the pilot
training program. It will send 30 pilots to the United States next week for 12
hours of flight simulation training and 16 hours of ground training.</P>
      <P>Troubled by financial difficulties, the carrier suspended its flight training
programs in May last year alongside an abrupt halt of its international and
domestic flight operations, FAT said in a press release.</P>
      <P>But FAT did not claim bankruptcy and a court ruled in April this year that the
airline should be restructured. Huafu then took over management of the company
and its restructuring.</P>
      <P>As the Civil Aeronautics Administration  has rescinded the airline's rights to
operate international flights, FAT can only resume domestic flights and said it
hopes to do so by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>FAT will initially resume its flights on the Taipei-Kinmen and Taipei-Makong
routes, followed by cross-Taiwan Strait flights from Taipei to Chongqing in

      <P>As the Tourism Bureau has decided not to join the bid for the right to stage the
New Year's Eve light show and fireworks display at the Taipei 101 tower, Taipei
City's Department of Information and Tourism said Saturday it will do its best
to help find new sponsors.</P>
      <P>A local newspaper reported Saturday that the Tourism Bureau of the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications, the major sponsor of the Taipei 101 light
show in the past two years, will not be able to sponsor the show this year
because it has put a lot of its financial resources into boosting tourism
business in areas hit by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Other companies are also reluctant to sponsor the show because their budgets
have been very tight this year in the wake of the global financial crisis, the
newspaper said.</P>
      <P>Commissioner Chung-hwa Tuo of the city's tourism bureau said that the New Year's
Eve display at the 101 tower helps to lift Taipei's international profile as it
usually gets international media coverage.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the bureau, which is also on a tight budget, will do its best to find
the best sponsors at the lowest cost to stage a spectacular 2009 show, he said.</P>
      <P>Last year, the Tourism Bureau, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Chunghwa
Telecom. Co., Ltd., jointly won the bid for the right to stage the light show at
a cost of NT$21 million (US$650,014).</P>
      <P>Every year at the stroke of midnight, the fireworks display at the Taipei 101
skyscraper -- one of the tallest buildings in the world -- brings the New Year
countdown to a dazzling crescendo watched by tens of thousands of revelers.</P>
      <P>According to a Tourism Bureau official, 75 television networks in 26 countries
broadcast footage of the New Year's Eve fireworks at Taipei 101 last year,
creating media publicity that the Tourism Bureau estimated as being worth more

      <P>The Alishan Highway, which was heavily damaged during Typhoon Morakot in August,
will be opened to allow, at the maximum, nine-seater vans, and they will only be
permitted to go as far as Fenchifu -- one of the tourist spots on the mountain
-- the bureau said.</P>
      <P>This will allow local tour agencies to take tourists in small groups to the
mountain, which is a popular destination among Chinese sightseeers, and help the
recovery of tourism in the area, Tourism Bureau officials said.</P>
      <P>The Alishan Highway, also known as Highway No. 18, was washed out in several
places by the storm and has since been closed for repairs.</P>
      <P>The section of the highway that will be reopened will not be able to accommodate
large coaches, and tourists will have to make the trip in vehicles carrying a
maximum of nine passengers, according to the Tourism Bureau.</P>
      <P>The road between Fenchifu and the Alishan Forest Recreation Area will remain
closed to traffic, it added.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau's statistics, around 12,000 Chinese visited Taiwan
during China's eight-day National Day holiday from Oct. 1, bringing in NT$760
million in tourism revenues.</P>
      <P>Although the number of Chinese visitors during the holiday period doubled from
last year, visitor arrivals from China were still low compared with the peak
number of 3, 000 to 4,000 a day in the first six months of the year,the bureau
said.</P>
      <P>After the long Chinese holiday, the number of visitors from China dropped to
below 1,000 a day, it said, adding that the closure of the Alishan area and the
outbreak of influenza A(H1N1) have been two of the contributing factors.</P>

      <P>In his address on the Republic of China's 98th National Day, President Ma Ying-
jeou reviewed the lessons that the government has learned over the last year and
outlined his vision for the development of the nation.</P>
      <P>He stressed  the  importance  of disaster  prevention  and environmental
sustainability at time of drastic global climate change. In the wake of the
Typhoon Morakot disaster in August, he said, a national land planning and
conservation law must be enacted to ensure public safety and guarantee
sustainable growth.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy, which was hard hit in the global economic crunch, showed signs
of improvement in Q3 compared with Q2, while a benchmark economic indicator has
been flashing an upbeat "yellow- blue light" over the past three months, he
noted.</P>
      <P>The president said his administration has been working, with the people's
support, to further improve relations between Taiwan and China and thus expand
Taiwan's international presence.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan will not sacrifice national security in its pursuit of cross-
strait  peace,  the president said.  Taiwan's insistence on the national defense
strategy of effective deterrence and resolute defense remains firm, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Following is full text of President Ma Ying-jeou's National Day address:</P>
      <P>Vice President Siew, Presidents of the Five Yuans, Presidential Advisors,
NationalPolicy Advisers, Ministers, Distinguished Guests, Fellow Countrymen:
Good morning! Today is the 98th National Day of the Republic of China. In mid-
August, it was decided that this year we would forego the usual Double Tenth Day
celebrations. We simply are not in the festive mood necessary to celebrate this
national day as we mourn the deaths and disappearances  of more than 700
compatriots during the Typhoon Morakot disaster. It feels as if we had lost our
own family members.</P>
      <P>We can only hope that the spirits of the deceased rest in peace as we strive to
make our homeland more secure from such disasters and to ensure that such
tragedies never happen again. To the disaster victims and to all of our
citizens, we solemnly pledge to do our utmost in this regard.</P>
      <P>Effective Land Planning, Comforting Disaster Victims Recent years have seen
anomalous  global climatic  changes  accompanied  by large-scale disasters
around the world, a trend particularly evident in the Asia- Pacific region. Two
months ago, Taiwan received a shocking education in the ways of nature, from
which we have learned painful lessons. We awakened to the reality that, the
earth is humanity's sole source of sustenance and security, so we must be humble
in dealing with nature and become rooted in the concept of development based on
harmony with the natural environment; and we must desist from fighting against
the land we live on.</P>
      <P>This year will be a turning  point in the work of land conservation. As soon as
possible, we must pass a national land planning bill that effectively puts
public safety first, takes human livelihood  as a central  concern,  and aims at
environmental sustainability as our ultimate goal. In particular, the bill
should prohibit or strictly limit the development of areas vulnerable to
disaster.</P>
      <P>In the future, reconstruction in disaster areas should take climate change into
consideration and should be integrated with ongoing waterway and land management
planning. When relocation of communities becomes necessary, we should ensure
that they are relocated from danger zones to safe areas, and in so far as
possible, the areas  to which they are relocated  must be within  the
administrative borders of their original villages, or at least within their
original rural township, so as to facilitate the continuity and sustainability
of original patterns of culture and livelihood following reconstruction.</P>
      <P>Another crucial lesson the Morakot disaster has taught us is that disaster
preparedness is more important than disaster relief. As long as disaster
preparedness work is carried out effectively, casualties and losses can be
greatly reduced. To that end, we have launched reforms of current disaster
preparedness systems and operations aimed at strengthening coordination and
communications between central and local governments, training and drilling
local government units in routine disaster preparedness measures, and
heightening citizens' awareness of the importance of disaster preparedness.</P>
      <P>Preparedness and rescue work has also been prioritized as a core mission of our
armed forces. As a matter of routine, the nation's five military zones will
carry out regular troop deployments in a manner that ensures they are prepared
for disasters. And when a possible disaster situation appears imminent, troops
will be deployed in advance to threatened areas so that they can be at the ready
to engage in rescue operations.</P>
      <P>In fact, before the Morakot disaster struck,  33 township magistrates, village
heads, police and fire chiefs, and landslide experts took decisive action to
evacuate and relocate some 9,100 people from 21 villages. Had they failed to
take such timely action, casualties would have increased by over 1,000. Thanks
to the heightened disaster preparedness of these heroes and their accurate
judgment of conditions, many lives were saved.</P>
      <P>In the course of Morakot disaster relief efforts, we have witnessed the
compassion of the people of Taiwan and the resilience of this land. In the wake
of the disaster, government agencies, citizens,  and charitable organizations
islandwide have devoted themselves to serving the needs of those in disaster
areas and made generous donations totaling some NT$17.8 billion [about US$550
million]. As for rescue and relief work, our military personnel performed over
560, 000 person-missions; police, fire and public works departments conducted
more than 410,000 person-missions; and volunteers carried out in excess of
140,000 person-missions. They feared no danger or obstacle, working round-the-
clock to save lives, relocate victims, repair roads, bridges and levees, dredge
rivers, and clean up homes. These heroes rescued over 50,000 disaster victims.</P>
      <P>Among their ranks are soldiers, pilots, policemen, firefighters, village chiefs,
and volunteers. Regrettably, we are unable to acknowledge each of them by name,
and only a small number of them have received public recognition. The huge
majority remain unsung heroes, unassumingly laboring with all their hearts for
victims they look upon as family.</P>
      <P>Though floodwaters are heartless, it is in adversity that the strong solidarity
and vitality of the people of Taiwan shine through as we all cease to think of
ourselves and join hands in mutual help.</P>
      <P>It is this sentiment that gives us faith that things will change for the better.
We must harness this strength as the motive power for Taiwan's ongoing progress.</P>
      <P>Braver with Every Challenge, Turning Crisis into Opportunity Since coming into
office in May of last year, this administration has become profoundly aware that
the world is entering into an era of sudden change and tremendous challenges. We
have further come to see that the way in which a country responds to them is key
to its fortunes--even to its very survival. Last year we were first hit by the
global financial tsunami, in which international banks went out of business,
stock markets plummeted, and people panicked. Along with these developments came
stagnation of exports, economic slowdown, and mounting unemployment.</P>
      <P>Our government immediately responded to these challenges with deliberate and
measured action. We stabilized the financial sector by fully guaranteeing all
bank deposits and cutting interest rates several times.  We boosted consumer
confidence  and stimulated consumption by launching programs to expand domestic
demand. We opened up new vistas for business by liberalizing restrictions on
economic interchange between Taiwan and mainland China, by opening Taiwan to
direct visits by mainland Chinese tourists, and by launching direct air, sea,
and postal links across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>And we sparked new momentum for growth by designing policies to promote six
emerging star industries and spur the development of a diversified economy. In
addition, we instituted policies designed to bring about more efficient energy
use and create a low-carbon economy. Our actions on this front have reversed an
eight-year period of stagnation. The nation has saved 4.5 terawatt hours of
power over the past year alone, or the equivalent of a year's energy consumption
by the 1.87 million residents of Tainan County and Tainan City. Over this same
time period, we have also cut CO2 emissions by nearly 2.9 million tons, which is
equal to 7,784 times the annual CO2 absorption capacity of Da-an Forest Park,
one of the largest parks in Taipei.</P>
      <P>These measures  have enabled Taiwan to weather the global financial  tsunami and
advance toward our goal of becoming a low-carbon economy. Taiwan's ranking in
the World Economic Forum's competitiveness index has jumped five notches to 12th
place. And our ranking in the World Bank's Doing Business 2010 report has risen
to No. 46, up 15 notches.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the economic monitoring indicators of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development have registered an upbeat "yellow- blue light" for
three consecutive months, and overall economic conditions  in the third quarter
of this year have improved significantly in comparison with the second quarter.
This indicates that the economy has bottomed out and is now on the rebound.</P>
      <P>As the saying goes, "Break an arm, yet get up braver" [i.e., when the going gets
tough, the tough get going]. Taiwan has not been overwhelmed by the financial
turmoil. On the contrary, we are more confident and able to deal with external
challenges than ever.</P>
      <P>A few months ago, the outbreak of A(H1N1) novel influenza in Mexico raised fears
worldwide. Although it is not as lethal as SARS [severe acute respiratory
syndrome], we cannot afford to weaken our vigilance. Over the past five months,
our public and private epidemic- prevention efforts--whether in preparing
vaccines and medicines or promoting public health measures--have been on a par
with those undertaken by advanced countries. Both infection and fatality rates
have remained low, and it is gratifying to see that our citizens have been so
cooperative. Although the fall and winter seasons could see a higher incidence
of A(H1N1) influenza, we are fully prepared and confident that we will be able
to minimize its spread.</P>
      <P>Morakot will not be the last typhoon, nor will novel influenza A(H1N1) be the
last pandemic, to hit Taiwan. In facing potential natural disasters in the
future, we must anticipate a broader range of problems and take aggressive
measures to protect ourselves. If we prepare for every typhoon as a possible
Morakot and every outbreak of infectious disease as another SARS epidemic, then
harm can certainly be greatly reduced. Typhoon Parma is the first typhoon to hit
Taiwan since Morakot. With lessons learned from Morakot fresh in mind, 7,863
people were evacuated well in advance of Parma's arrival, evidencing much
improvement in our vigilance against potential disasters.</P>
      <P>Over the past few decades, the people of Taiwan have been toughened by
successive trials and tribulations. A widely shared awareness of the need to be
on guard against the unexpected has kept us from falling into complacency. This
mindset has enabled us to weather all sorts of hardships and adversities, which
is the fundamental reason why Taiwan has stood firm and steady. Now it is time
to take it up a notch. We must further heighten our awareness of the need for
disaster preparedness, and enhance our capacity for action.</P>
      <P>Rebuilding Cross-Strait Relations, Expanding our International Participation The
past year has witnessed considerable improvements in relations between Taiwan
and mainland China. The prospect of peace across the Taiwan Strait appears to be
at hand. This progress is a result of efforts on both sides. Our decision to
move in this direction is in line with the hopes of the majority of our people,
and has also been very well received by the international community.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, working on the pragmatic basis of the "1992 Consensus, " we
have expanded the scope of cross-strait cooperation, and have achieved greater
mutual trust and good will, as evidenced by the signing of nine agreements
covering such topics as visits to Taiwan by mainland tourists, direct air, sea,
and postal links, food safety inspections, and cross-strait legal assistance. We
believe that there remains much work for us to tackle for the sake of the well-
being of our peoples, including negotiation of memorandums of understanding
(MOUs) on financial supervisory cooperation, and an economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>Cross-strait differences and concerns are rooted in historical factors that
cannot be overcome all at once. To achieve further peaceful development of our
relations, both sides must remain patient, face up to practical realities, and
move forward in a gradual, orderly manner, so as to build mutual trust and find
common ground amid our differences.</P>
      <P>A touching  and inspirational  development  in cross-strait interaction  was the
surge of relief donations  and practical assistance from Taiwan in response to
last year's Sichuan earthquake in mainland China. Taiwan's support for the
relief effort exceeded that of all other nations in terms of either monetary
value or number of volunteers. Then, in response to the disaster inflicted on
Taiwan by Typhoon Morakot in August, mainland China was no less generous in
offering material assistance and donations, likewise exceeding those of all
other nations. Such interaction, reflecting the feeling shared by both peoples
with common ethnic roots that "blood is thicker than water,  " inspires us to
look forward to future cross-strait developments with confidence and hope.</P>
      <P>At the same time, we are well aware that even as we actively pursue peaceful
development of cross-strait relations, some of our citizens worry that our
national sovereignty and interests might be harmed. We are willing to engage in
dialogue via all sorts of channels, including the Legislature and political
parties, in order to forge a public consensus on this government's mainland
China policy. Taiwan is a democratic society, and our foremost guiding principle
in addressing cross-strait issues is to safeguard our national sovereignty and
advance our people's welfare while welcoming the public's and the Legislature's
scrutiny. I am constantly mindful of this responsibility, and will do all in my
power to ensure that it is fulfilled.</P>
      <P>Improvement of cross-strait relations is beneficial to our foreign relations, as
all countries,  whether or not we have diplomatic ties with them, are all happy
to see an easing of cross-strait tensions. Most of them are also willing to
develop friendly relations with both Taiwan and mainland China. Over the past
year-plus period, we have been promoting a policy of "flexible diplomacy, " and
the two sides have demonstrated good will by refraining  from attempts to lure
away the other's diplomatic partners. Relations with our diplomatic partners are
gradually becoming more stable, and Taiwan's international status has been
steadily enhanced.</P>
      <P>Consequently, we have achieved breakthroughs in the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders' Meeting, the Government Procurement
Agreement under the World Trade Organization,  and participation in the World
Health Assembly. In May this year, the ROC ratified the United Nations' two 1966
human rights covenants- -the International  Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights--
for which we have won praise in international human rights circles.</P>
      <P>With regard to our strategy for rejoining the United Nations system, since last
year we have abandoned futile confrontation and adopted as our priority goal
participation in the United Nations' specialized agencies and their activities
so as to substantively enhance  Taiwan's  participation  in and contributions
to the international community. These pragmatic, feasible approaches have
garnered widespread international affirmation and greatly improved Taiwan's
international image and status.</P>
      <P>Flexible diplomacy is a diplomacy of integrity, a humanitarian diplomacy, as
well as a soft-power diplomacy. It not only has expanded Taiwan's international
maneuvering room, but has won the respect of the international community. In
July and September of this year, our nation played host, respectively, to the
Eighth World Games in Kaohsiung and the 21st Summer Deaflympics in Taipei. In
both sporting events, our athletes turned in outstanding performances, garnering
record numbers of medals and finishing seventh and fifth, respectively, in the
medal count among the hundred-plus nations that took part in each event.
Moreover, people from everywhere were impressed with the meticulous preparations
carried out by the Taipei and Kaohsiung municipal governments, our central
government's strong support, our numerous volunteers' enthusiasm, and the
Taiwanese people's friendliness and hospitality.</P>
      <P>It is little wonder then, that Ron Froehlich, president of the International
World Games Association (IWGA) , publicly extolled the Kaohsiung World Games as
the most successful ever; while Donalda Ammoms, president of the International
Sports Committee for the Deaf (ICSD) , repeatedly praised the Taipei Summer
Deaflympics as the best-managed in the past 85 years. Moreover, my announcing of
the opening ceremonies of the two games in the capacity of president of the host
nation was also a first for the games. All of this goes to show that so long as
we have real strength and move in the right direction, the whole world will
cheer us on.</P>
      <P>Despite  the recent  dramatic  improvement  in cross-strait relations, we have
never overlooked the military threat posed by mainland China. We are indeed
actively pursuing peace across the Taiwan Strait, but we shall never sacrifice
Taiwan's national security.  Our insistence on the national defense strategy of
"effective deterrence and resolute defense" remains firm. We intend to
energetically develop a professional military based on recruitment of volunteers
to form a compact yet powerful defensive force to protect the security of
Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>Developing a Chinese Culture with Unique Taiwanese Character My dear friends,
looking back over the 98 years of the Republic of China's history inspires a
welter of contrasting feelings. Except for the " golden decade" immediately
following the Northern Expedition, the 38 years during which the ROC government
was based on the mainland was a period of incessant war and chaos that rendered
people destitute and rootless and allowed little opportunity to put into
practice the nation-building ideals of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Yet, over the six
decades since the ROC government relocated to Taiwan, it has succeeded in
carrying out land reform,  implementing universal education, promoting economic
growth, erecting a social welfare system and instituting democratic
constitutional government.</P>
      <P>After these 60 years of national development, Taiwan has a robust middle class,
enjoys an open and free media environment, and has a healthy civil society in
which environmental awareness has taken root, while community-building and
volunteerism have developed at a lively pace. Step by step, we have created a
Chinese culture with a unique Taiwanese character--a heritage belonging to all
of us and in which we all can take pride.</P>
      <P>During the past six decades, the histories and cultures of the Republic of China
and Taiwan have become thoroughly intertwined. In this context, "Taiwan spirit"
is not a vapid slogan, but is concretely embodied in the values and character of
those who have struggled for this land.</P>
      <P>The many individuals  who have held  resolutely  to their convictions over the
past century are exemplars of Taiwan spirit.</P>
      <P>Examples from the Japanese colonial period include Lien Ya-tang, the historian
who chronicled the early years of Taiwan history, Chiang Wei-shui, a leading
civil rights activist, Mona Rudao, who fought against colonial oppression, and
Lai He, a pioneer of Taiwanese literature. Notable post-war figures include Chen
Cheng, who promoted land reform, Li Kuo-ting and Sun Yun-suan, who oversaw the
transformation of Taiwan's economy, and the many who struggled for freedom and
democracy over the decades through publications such as Free China magazine and
Formosan magazine.</P>
      <P>Their spirit lives on today in the athletes who gave their all in the World
Games and Deaflympics; in the donors, volunteers and humanitarian organizations
that donated money and saved lives in the recent disaster; and in the bus
drivers Su Sheng-yu and Hou Wen- tien, whose actions in September saved the
lives of their passengers though they themselves died.</P>
      <P>Further, there are those who have taken Taiwan's culture onto the world stage,
such as members of the U-Theatre, the Performance Workshop and the Hsiao Hsi
Yuan Puppet Theater. Similarly, Ju Ming's sculptures,  Liao Shiou-ping's block
prints and Liu Kuo-sung's innovative Chinese ink paintings have won
international acclaim, securing for Taiwan a position of respect in the world of
art.</P>
      <P>Such examples of Taiwan spirit highlight the core values of the Taiwanese people
and inject Taiwan's vital, unique character into the deepest levels of Chinese
culture. "Taiwan spirit" has enriched the inner essence of Chinese culture while
giving sustenance to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It has nurtured you and me, and it will nourish our descendants. We should,
then, treasure one another and walk forward hand in hand, developing our Taiwan
spirit and transmitting it to posterity.</P>
      <P>Inheriting the Past, Ushering in the Future In another 400-plus days, the
Republic of China will enter into its one-hundredth year as a nation. The cries
of those revolutionaries a century ago still echo in our ears, and the ideals of
the nation's founders still gleam before our eyes. It is still our common vow to
build a nation of the people, by the people and for the people. And solidarity
of the people, power to the people, and prosperity of the people [Sun Yat- sen's
Three Principles of the People] remain the goals toward which we strive.</P>
      <P>In order to celebrate this grand day and to let upcoming generations know that
the Republic will always stand firm through whatever storm comes our way, and
that we will emerge shining brighter from every trial, I hereby announce on this
National Day the establishment of the "Republic of China Centennial Preparatory
Commission" chaired by Vice President Siew to coordinate the public and private
sectors in planning a year-long series of celebratory activities.</P>
      <P>My dear compatriots, our confidence is resolute and unwavering, our steps sure
and steady. We shall spare no efforts in carrying forward our various national
development programs, so as to lay a solid foundation for the Republic's
flourishing century to come. In closing, may our nation have great success and
prosperity! And may you and your families all be blessed with health, peace, and
happiness! Thank you!</P>

      <P>Vice President Siew, Presidents of the Five Yuans, Presidential Advisors,
NationalPolicy Advisers, Ministers, Distinguished Guests, Fellow Countrymen:
Good morning! Today is the 98th National Day of the Republic of China. In mid-
August, it was decided that this year we would forego the usual Double Tenth Day
celebrations. We simply are not in the festive mood necessary to celebrate this
national day as we mourn the deaths and disappearances  of more than 700
compatriots during the Typhoon Morakot disaster. It feels as if we had lost our
own family members.</P>
      <P>We can only hope that the spirits of the deceased rest in peace as we strive to
make our homeland more secure from such disasters and to ensure that such
tragedies never happen again. To the disaster victims and to all of our
citizens, we solemnly pledge to do our utmost in this regard.</P>

      <P>This year will be a turning  point in the work of land conservation. As soon as
possible, we must pass a national land planning bill that effectively puts
public safety first, takes human livelihood  as a central  concern,  and aims at
environmental sustainability as our ultimate goal. In particular, the bill
should prohibit or strictly limit the development of areas vulnerable to
disaster.</P>
      <P>In the future, reconstruction in disaster areas should take climate change into
consideration and should be integrated with ongoing waterway and land management
planning. When relocation of communities becomes necessary, we should ensure
that they are relocated from danger zones to safe areas, and in so far as
possible, the areas  to which they are relocated  must be within  the
administrative borders of their original villages, or at least within their
original rural township, so as to facilitate the continuity and sustainability
of original patterns of culture and livelihood following reconstruction.</P>
      <P>Another crucial lesson the Morakot disaster has taught us is that disaster
preparedness is more important than disaster relief. As long as disaster
preparedness work is carried out effectively, casualties and losses can be
greatly reduced. To that end, we have launched reforms of current disaster
preparedness systems and operations aimed at strengthening coordination and
communications between central and local governments, training and drilling
local government units in routine disaster preparedness measures, and
heightening citizens' awareness of the importance of disaster preparedness.</P>
      <P>Preparedness and rescue work has also been prioritized as a core mission of our
armed forces. As a matter of routine, the nation's five military zones will
carry out regular troop deployments in a manner that ensures they are prepared
for disasters. And when a possible disaster situation appears imminent, troops
will be deployed in advance to threatened areas so that they can be at the ready
to engage in rescue operations.</P>
      <P>In fact, before the Morakot disaster struck,  33 township magistrates, village
heads, police and fire chiefs, and landslide experts took decisive action to
evacuate and relocate some 9,100 people from 21 villages. Had they failed to
take such timely action, casualties would have increased by over 1,000. Thanks
to the heightened disaster preparedness of these heroes and their accurate
judgment of conditions, many lives were saved.</P>
      <P>In the course of Morakot disaster relief efforts, we have witnessed the
compassion of the people of Taiwan and the resilience of this land. In the wake
of the disaster, government agencies, citizens,  and charitable organizations
islandwide have devoted themselves to serving the needs of those in disaster
areas and made generous donations totaling some NT$17.8 billion [about US$550
million]. As for rescue and relief work, our military personnel performed over
560, 000 person-missions; police, fire and public works departments conducted
more than 410,000 person-missions; and volunteers carried out in excess of
140,000 person-missions. They feared no danger or obstacle, working round-the-
clock to save lives, relocate victims, repair roads, bridges and levees, dredge
rivers, and clean up homes. These heroes rescued over 50,000 disaster victims.</P>
      <P>Among their ranks are soldiers, pilots, policemen, firefighters, village chiefs,
and volunteers. Regrettably, we are unable to acknowledge each of them by name,
and only a small number of them have received public recognition. The huge
majority remain unsung heroes, unassumingly laboring with all their hearts for
victims they look upon as family.</P>
      <P>Though floodwaters are heartless, it is in adversity that the strong solidarity
and vitality of the people of Taiwan shine through as we all cease to think of
ourselves and join hands in mutual help.</P>
      <P>It is this sentiment that gives us faith that things will change for the better.
We must harness this strength as the motive power for Taiwan's ongoing progress.</P>
      <P>Braver with Every Challenge, Turning Crisis into Opportunity Since coming into
office in May of last year, this administration has become profoundly aware that
the world is entering into an era of sudden change and tremendous challenges. We
have further come to see that the way in which a country responds to them is key
to its fortunes--even to its very survival. Last year we were first hit by the
global financial tsunami, in which international banks went out of business,
stock markets plummeted, and people panicked. Along with these developments came
stagnation of exports, economic slowdown, and mounting unemployment.</P>
      <P>Our government immediately responded to these challenges with deliberate and
measured action. We stabilized the financial sector by fully guaranteeing all
bank deposits and cutting interest rates several times.  We boosted consumer
confidence  and stimulated consumption by launching programs to expand domestic
demand. We opened up new vistas for business by liberalizing restrictions on
economic interchange between Taiwan and mainland China, by opening Taiwan to
direct visits by mainland Chinese tourists, and by launching direct air, sea,
and postal links across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>And we sparked new momentum for growth by designing policies to promote six
emerging star industries and spur the development of a diversified economy. In
addition, we instituted policies designed to bring about more efficient energy
use and create a low-carbon economy. Our actions on this front have reversed an
eight-year period of stagnation. The nation has saved 4.5 terawatt hours of
power over the past year alone, or the equivalent of a year's energy consumption
by the 1.87 million residents of Tainan County and Tainan City. Over this same
time period, we have also cut CO2 emissions by nearly 2.9 million tons, which is
equal to 7,784 times the annual CO2 absorption capacity of Da-an Forest Park,
one of the largest parks in Taipei.</P>
      <P>These measures  have enabled Taiwan to weather the global financial  tsunami and
advance toward our goal of becoming a low-carbon economy. Taiwan's ranking in
the World Economic Forum's competitiveness index has jumped five notches to 12th
place. And our ranking in the World Bank's Doing Business 2010 report has risen
to No. 46, up 15 notches.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the economic monitoring indicators of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development have registered an upbeat "yellow- blue light" for
three consecutive months, and overall economic conditions  in the third quarter
of this year have improved significantly in comparison with the second quarter.
This indicates that the economy has bottomed out and is now on the rebound.</P>
      <P>As the saying goes, "Break an arm, yet get up braver" [i.e., when the going gets
tough, the tough get going]. Taiwan has not been overwhelmed by the financial
turmoil. On the contrary, we are more confident and able to deal with external
challenges than ever.</P>
      <P>A few months ago, the outbreak of A(H1N1) novel influenza in Mexico raised fears
worldwide. Although it is not as lethal as SARS [severe acute respiratory
syndrome], we cannot afford to weaken our vigilance. Over the past five months,
our public and private epidemic- prevention efforts--whether in preparing
vaccines and medicines or promoting public health measures--have been on a par
with those undertaken by advanced countries. Both infection and fatality rates
have remained low, and it is gratifying to see that our citizens have been so
cooperative. Although the fall and winter seasons could see a higher incidence
of A(H1N1) influenza, we are fully prepared and confident that we will be able
to minimize its spread.</P>
      <P>Morakot will not be the last typhoon, nor will novel influenza A(H1N1) be the
last pandemic, to hit Taiwan. In facing potential natural disasters in the
future, we must anticipate a broader range of problems and take aggressive
measures to protect ourselves. If we prepare for every typhoon as a possible
Morakot and every outbreak of infectious disease as another SARS epidemic, then
harm can certainly be greatly reduced. Typhoon Parma is the first typhoon to hit
Taiwan since Morakot. With lessons learned from Morakot fresh in mind, 7,863
people were evacuated well in advance of Parma's arrival, evidencing much
improvement in our vigilance against potential disasters.</P>
      <P>Over the past few decades, the people of Taiwan have been toughened by
successive trials and tribulations. A widely shared awareness of the need to be
on guard against the unexpected has kept us from falling into complacency. This
mindset has enabled us to weather all sorts of hardships and adversities, which
is the fundamental reason why Taiwan has stood firm and steady. Now it is time
to take it up a notch. We must further heighten our awareness of the need for
disaster preparedness, and enhance our capacity for action.</P>
      <P>Rebuilding Cross-Strait Relations, Expanding our International Participation The
past year has witnessed considerable improvements in relations between Taiwan
and mainland China. The prospect of peace across the Taiwan Strait appears to be
at hand. This progress is a result of efforts on both sides. Our decision to
move in this direction is in line with the hopes of the majority of our people,
and has also been very well received by the international community.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, working on the pragmatic basis of the "1992 Consensus, " we
have expanded the scope of cross-strait cooperation, and have achieved greater
mutual trust and good will, as evidenced by the signing of nine agreements
covering such topics as visits to Taiwan by mainland tourists, direct air, sea,
and postal links, food safety inspections, and cross-strait legal assistance. We
believe that there remains much work for us to tackle for the sake of the well-
being of our peoples, including negotiation of memorandums of understanding
(MOUs) on financial supervisory cooperation, and an economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>Cross-strait differences and concerns are rooted in historical factors that
cannot be overcome all at once. To achieve further peaceful development of our
relations, both sides must remain patient, face up to practical realities, and
move forward in a gradual, orderly manner, so as to build mutual trust and find
common ground amid our differences.</P>
      <P>A touching  and inspirational  development  in cross-strait interaction  was the
surge of relief donations  and practical assistance from Taiwan in response to
last year's Sichuan earthquake in mainland China. Taiwan's support for the
relief effort exceeded that of all other nations in terms of either monetary
value or number of volunteers. Then, in response to the disaster inflicted on
Taiwan by Typhoon Morakot in August, mainland China was no less generous in
offering material assistance and donations, likewise exceeding those of all
other nations. Such interaction, reflecting the feeling shared by both peoples
with common ethnic roots that "blood is thicker than water,  " inspires us to
look forward to future cross-strait developments with confidence and hope.</P>
      <P>At the same time, we are well aware that even as we actively pursue peaceful
development of cross-strait relations, some of our citizens worry that our
national sovereignty and interests might be harmed. We are willing to engage in
dialogue via all sorts of channels, including the Legislature and political
parties, in order to forge a public consensus on this government's mainland
China policy. Taiwan is a democratic society, and our foremost guiding principle
in addressing cross-strait issues is to safeguard our national sovereignty and
advance our people's welfare while welcoming the public's and the Legislature's
scrutiny. I am constantly mindful of this responsibility, and will do all in my
power to ensure that it is fulfilled.</P>
      <P>Improvement of cross-strait relations is beneficial to our foreign relations, as
all countries,  whether or not we have diplomatic ties with them, are all happy
to see an easing of cross-strait tensions. Most of them are also willing to
develop friendly relations with both Taiwan and mainland China. Over the past
year-plus period, we have been promoting a policy of "flexible diplomacy, " and
the two sides have demonstrated good will by refraining  from attempts to lure
away the other's diplomatic partners. Relations with our diplomatic partners are
gradually becoming more stable, and Taiwan's international status has been
steadily enhanced.</P>
      <P>Consequently, we have achieved breakthroughs in the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders' Meeting, the Government Procurement
Agreement under the World Trade Organization,  and participation in the World
Health Assembly. In May this year, the ROC ratified the United Nations' two 1966
human rights covenants- -the International  Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights--
for which we have won praise in international human rights circles.</P>
      <P>With regard to our strategy for rejoining the United Nations system, since last
year we have abandoned futile confrontation and adopted as our priority goal
participation in the United Nations' specialized agencies and their activities
so as to substantively enhance  Taiwan's  participation  in and contributions
to the international community. These pragmatic, feasible approaches have
garnered widespread international affirmation and greatly improved Taiwan's
international image and status.</P>
      <P>Flexible diplomacy is a diplomacy of integrity, a humanitarian diplomacy, as
well as a soft-power diplomacy. It not only has expanded Taiwan's international
maneuvering room, but has won the respect of the international community. In
July and September of this year, our nation played host, respectively, to the
Eighth World Games in Kaohsiung and the 21st Summer Deaflympics in Taipei. In
both sporting events, our athletes turned in outstanding performances, garnering
record numbers of medals and finishing seventh and fifth, respectively, in the
medal count among the hundred-plus nations that took part in each event.
Moreover, people from everywhere were impressed with the meticulous preparations
carried out by the Taipei and Kaohsiung municipal governments, our central
government's strong support, our numerous volunteers' enthusiasm, and the
Taiwanese people's friendliness and hospitality.</P>
      <P>It is little wonder then, that Ron Froehlich, president of the International
World Games Association (IWGA) , publicly extolled the Kaohsiung World Games as
the most successful ever; while Donalda Ammoms, president of the International
Sports Committee for the Deaf (ICSD) , repeatedly praised the Taipei Summer
Deaflympics as the best-managed in the past 85 years. Moreover, my announcing of
the opening ceremonies of the two games in the capacity of president of the host
nation was also a first for the games. All of this goes to show that so long as
we have real strength and move in the right direction, the whole world will
cheer us on.</P>
      <P>Despite  the recent  dramatic  improvement  in cross-strait relations, we have
never overlooked the military threat posed by mainland China. We are indeed
actively pursuing peace across the Taiwan Strait, but we shall never sacrifice
Taiwan's national security.  Our insistence on the national defense strategy of
"effective deterrence and resolute defense" remains firm. We intend to
energetically develop a professional military based on recruitment of volunteers
to form a compact yet powerful defensive force to protect the security of
Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>Developing a Chinese Culture with Unique Taiwanese Character My dear friends,
looking back over the 98 years of the Republic of China's history inspires a
welter of contrasting feelings. Except for the " golden decade" immediately
following the Northern Expedition, the 38 years during which the ROC government
was based on the mainland was a period of incessant war and chaos that rendered
people destitute and rootless and allowed little opportunity to put into
practice the nation-building ideals of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Yet, over the six
decades since the ROC government relocated to Taiwan, it has succeeded in
carrying out land reform,  implementing universal education, promoting economic
growth, erecting a social welfare system and instituting democratic
constitutional government.</P>
      <P>After these 60 years of national development, Taiwan has a robust middle class,
enjoys an open and free media environment, and has a healthy civil society in
which environmental awareness has taken root, while community-building and
volunteerism have developed at a lively pace. Step by step, we have created a
Chinese culture with a unique Taiwanese character--a heritage belonging to all
of us and in which we all can take pride.</P>
      <P>During the past six decades, the histories and cultures of the Republic of China
and Taiwan have become thoroughly intertwined. In this context, "Taiwan spirit"
is not a vapid slogan, but is concretely embodied in the values and character of
those who have struggled for this land.</P>
      <P>The many individuals  who have held  resolutely  to their convictions over the
past century are exemplars of Taiwan spirit.</P>
      <P>Examples from the Japanese colonial period include Lien Ya-tang, the historian
who chronicled the early years of Taiwan history, Chiang Wei-shui, a leading
civil rights activist, Mona Rudao, who fought against colonial oppression, and
Lai He, a pioneer of Taiwanese literature. Notable post-war figures include Chen
Cheng, who promoted land reform, Li Kuo-ting and Sun Yun-suan, who oversaw the
transformation of Taiwan's economy, and the many who struggled for freedom and
democracy over the decades through publications such as Free China magazine and
Formosan magazine.</P>
      <P>Their spirit lives on today in the athletes who gave their all in the World
Games and Deaflympics; in the donors, volunteers and humanitarian organizations
that donated money and saved lives in the recent disaster; and in the bus
drivers Su Sheng-yu and Hou Wen- tien, whose actions in September saved the
lives of their passengers though they themselves died.</P>
      <P>Further, there are those who have taken Taiwan's culture onto the world stage,
such as members of the U-Theatre, the Performance Workshop and the Hsiao Hsi
Yuan Puppet Theater. Similarly, Ju Ming's sculptures,  Liao Shiou-ping's block
prints and Liu Kuo-sung's innovative Chinese ink paintings have won
international acclaim, securing for Taiwan a position of respect in the world of
art.</P>
      <P>Such examples of Taiwan spirit highlight the core values of the Taiwanese people
and inject Taiwan's vital, unique character into the deepest levels of Chinese
culture. "Taiwan spirit" has enriched the inner essence of Chinese culture while
giving sustenance to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It has nurtured you and me, and it will nourish our descendants. We should,
then, treasure one another and walk forward hand in hand, developing our Taiwan
spirit and transmitting it to posterity.</P>
      <P>Inheriting the Past, Ushering in the Future In another 400-plus days, the
Republic of China will enter into its one-hundredth year as a nation. The cries
of those revolutionaries a century ago still echo in our ears, and the ideals of
the nation's founders still gleam before our eyes. It is still our common vow to
build a nation of the people, by the people and for the people. And solidarity
of the people, power to the people, and prosperity of the people [Sun Yat- sen's
Three Principles of the People] remain the goals toward which we strive.</P>
      <P>In order to celebrate this grand day and to let upcoming generations know that
the Republic will always stand firm through whatever storm comes our way, and
that we will emerge shining brighter from every trial, I hereby announce on this
National Day the establishment of the "Republic of China Centennial Preparatory
Commission" chaired by Vice President Siew to coordinate the public and private
sectors in planning a year-long series of celebratory activities.</P>
      <P>My dear compatriots, our confidence is resolute and unwavering, our steps sure
and steady. We shall spare no efforts in carrying forward our various national
development programs, so as to lay a solid foundation for the Republic's
flourishing century to come. In closing, may our nation have great success and
prosperity! And may you and your families all be blessed with health, peace, and
happiness! Thank you!</P>

      <P>Institutional investors said they see a better future for cross-strait
relations, which will help boost the local stock market, based on President Ma
Ying-jeou's remarks in his Double Ten National Day address.</P>
      <P>President Ma in his address said that working pragmatically on the basis of the
"1992 consensus," the scope of cross-strait cooperation has been expanded with
the signing of nine agreements on matters such as visits to Taiwan by mainland
tourists, direct air, sea, and postal links, food safety inspections, and cross-

      <P>Most of the institutional investors, including the Capital Group, are of the
opinion that the president's remarks "are tantamount to declaring that the
government is sure to meet the public's expectations (regarding the signing of
the MOUs and an ECFA). "</P>
      <P>They said that with the government's determination to further develop relations
between Taiwan and China, the local stock market will be benefit in the mid- and
long term.</P>
      <P>As for the performance of the local stock market in the short term, Tah Chang

the ROC government supports the U.S.-launched war against terrorism and has
taken steps to prevent terrorists from laundering money in Taiwan.

2001: The results of the first stage of a nationwide English evaluation
examination for people with a junior high school education background are

    <HEADLINE>SEF chairman returns home after attending Tory meeting in U.K.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 11 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chiang Pin-kung, Taiwan's top negotiator with China and head of the quasi-
official intermediary Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), returned to Taiwan from
the United Kingdom Sunday after attending a Tory conference in Manchester.</P>
      <P>Chiang attended the Conservative Party's annual conference in Manchester Oct.
4-9 in his capacity as a vice chairman of Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>He said he and two aides attended the meeting at the invitation of the U.K.'s
opposition Conservative Party, as both the KMT and the Tory are members of the
International Democratic Union (IDU).</P>
      <P>"Countries around the world have been paying closer attention to the Tories,
speculating that its leader David Cameron could win the general election next
June to become Britain's next prime minister, " Chiang said upon arrival at the
Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport.</P>
      <P>Cameron received a popularity boost following his speech at the Conservative
Party conference,  according  to the latest  Sky News/YouGov poll. Tory support
jumped 4 percent to 44 percent, while support for Labour fell to 27 percent,
according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Chiang  said he took the opportunity  to attend the Tory conference, which drew
the participation of representatives from many other IDU member countries, to
present information about President Ma Ying-jeou's cross-strait policies,  the
administration's  policy achievements and its prospects for the future.</P>
      <P>He said he worked 20 hours during his two nights in Manchester, meeting a total
of 24 delegates from IDU member countries, trying hard to inform them about
Taiwan and what the ruling KMT is doing in its efforts to improve cross-Taiwan
Strait relations.</P>
      <P>The SEF chairman, however, said he was saddened to note that some people back
home did not appreciate his efforts on the nation's behalf, and instead focused
on trivial matters like who paid the airfares for him and his two aides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Prevention better than cure in case of natural disasters: president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11 (CNA)
10/11/09  17:27:26
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou called Sunday for the country to avoid challenging nature
and said it is better to prevent natural disasters than to deal with their
aftermath.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of a national flood control conference in Taipei, Ma said
that natural resources are scarce in Taiwan, but natural disasters abound and
are an ever-present threat.</P>
      <P>Quoting government statistics, he said that 73 percent of the Republic of
China's territory and its population are constantly under threat from
earthquakes, flooding, typhoons and mudslides.</P>
      <P>He noted that, according to Nature magazine,  the surface temperature of
tropical oceans has increased by 0.5 degrees Celsius over the past 30 years,
resulting in the formation of 75 percent more powerful and potentially
destructive typhoons in the northwest Pacific.</P>
      <P>He said the power of the typhoons that have affected Taiwan has increased, as
has the volume of rainfall in the country over the past 20 years.</P>
      <P>In the 20th century, global temperatures edged up by 0.74 degrees on average,
but in Taiwan the increase was 1.2 degrees, which is one of the major reasons
why the typhoon threat is more devastating, he added.</P>
      <P>Citing precipitation records, he said that when the devastating Typhoon Herb
struck Taiwan in 1996, it brought torrential rainfall of more than 1987 mm, but
by 2001 when Typhoon Nari wreaked havoc on Taiwan the precipitation level from
that storm was 2319 mm. When Typhoon Morakot hit in August this year, the
rainfall it brought was an astounding 2965 mm, he noted.</P>
      <P>Natural disasters are unavoidable, but what the government can do is bolster
preventive and control measures in advance, he said.</P>
      <P>Mother Nature often does not give people time to escape, he said, pointing out
that mountain residents and people living near rivers had no time to flee, nor
could they be saved, when the mudslides triggered by Typhoon Morakot struck.</P>
      <P>"There was not even 72 seconds, let alone the so-called golden 72 hours, to save
them," he said</P>
      <P>When the magnitude 7.3 killer earthquake hit on Sept. 21, 1999, 38 rescue teams
from 21 countries came to Taiwan's aid. But there was no such aid from abroad in
the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot this August. "Few rescue teams would mobilize
for typhoon relief, " he noted.</P>
      <P>He said that fatalities from Typhoon Morakot could have been as high as 1,046 if
rural township and village officials did not have effective evacuation plans in
place.</P>
      <P>The president spent days and nights in flood-affected areas in eastern and
southern Taiwan in August in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot, which killed more
than 600 people and destroyed numerous villages.</P>
      <P>"The damage that Typhoon Morakot wrought was far beyond our imagination," he
said, recalling that a house located 100 meters from a river in the central
county of Nantou was washed away before anyone realized the danger.</P>
      <P>Evacuating or keeping away from risky places is one of the ways of avoiding
damage from natural disasters, but this is not always possible, he said.</P>
      <P>"This is the purpose of the national flood control conference, " he said. "I
look forward to seeing the start rather the end of discussions at this
conference, and hope to see the development of viable strategies that could be
used by the government as reference in its effort to improve flood control and
prevention."</P>
      <P>The conference, organized by the Water Resources Agency, brought together the
heads of 21 cities and counties and flood-control experts to discuss ways of
improving disaster prevention and relief measures.</P>
      <P>The discussions focused on post-Typhoon Morakot drainage and reconstruction,
measures to handle soil and silt buildups and disasters  in catchment areas,
flood control and water usage strategies to cope with abnormal weather
conditions, and the overall management of catchment areas.</P>
      <P>Representatives of disaster affected areas, legislators, Control Yuan members,
academics and student representatives also attended the conference.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Kinmen residents offered premium liquor commemorating old battle</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen, Oct. 11 (CNA)
10/11/09  17:49:51
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In commemoration of a battle 60 years ago when the Nationalist troops defeated
Communist China's People's Liberation Army at Gunington in Kinmen, the Kinmen
County government is offering islanders who survived the wartime years premium
liquor produced by the famous Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Inc.</P>
      <P>A total of 24,809 residents on the outlying island will each receive a designer
urn containing 5 liters of premium Kaoliang liquor from the county government.</P>
      <P>The residents who will receive the gifts include those born before Dec. 31, 1961
and those with household registrations on the island before its special war zone
status was lifted on Nov. 11, 1992.</P>
      <P>On Oct. 25, 1949, a 10,000-strong PLA force that landed on Kinmen's northern
Gunington beach was defeated by Nationalist troops. The Guningtou defeat
frustrated the Communists' attempts to take the frontline post and guaranteed
the safety of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, the residents of Kinmen remained under constant threat of war for
decades. On Aug. 23, 1958, the Chinese communists started heavy bombardment of
the island. Between Aug. 23 and Oct. 5, 1958, more than 450,000 shells were
reported to have fallen on the island from Quemoy on the other side, and for
three decades until the early 1990s, the islanders would have to endure half an
hour of bombardment one day every month from across the waters.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen distillery was first built in 1952 by the military, and the premium
liquor produced from sorghum became extremely popular in Taiwan. Since the
distillery was privatized and renamed Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Inc., the liquor
has not only earned handsome profits for the company, also contributed to the
county government's tax revenues.</P>
      <P>Statistics released by the county government showed that in 2007, the
distillery's business revenues amounted to NT$11.2 billion (US$350 million),
with pre-tax profits totaling NT$4.38 billion. The distillery paid NT$4 billion
in tax that year.</P>
      <P>To spread the revenue, the Kinmen County government has introduced many welfare
programs, including free lunches for school children, monthly allowances for
senior citizens and housewives with young babies, free public transportation,
and subsidies for college students.</P>
      <P>On the ocassion of Chinese New Year, Dragon Boat Festival and Moon Festival, the
distillery would offer gifts of Kaoliang liquor to all households on the island.</P>

      <P>Hotel operators in southern Taiwan are trying to cope with a tourism slump in
the area by making good use of online social networks, such as Plurk and
Facebook, and launching various promotional offers to attract more visitors.</P>
      <P>Most hotels in the area have seen a significant drop in occupancy rates because
of the Typhoon Morakot disaster in August and a boycott of southern Taiwan by
Chinese tourists following a controversial visit there by the Dalai Lama last
month.</P>
      <P>Su Hui-yun, a marketing executive at Hua Yuan Hotel in Kaohsiung City, said
Sunday that the hotel's occupancy rate has been about 50 percent recently.</P>
      <P>In an effort to boost business, the hotel applied for advertising space on
Plurk, which provides free online social networking and micro-blogging services,
Su said.</P>
      <P>People who who send the hotel a plurk -- short message -- or blog via Plurk will
have a chance to win a free three-day trip to Kaohsiung, according to Su.</P>
      <P>Kuo Shi-he, a publicity executive at Chateau Beach Resort in Kenting, Pingtung
County, said that driven by the Taiwan-made box-office hit "Cape No. 7, " which
is set in the southernmost county, the hotel was able to maintain an occupancy
rate of about 80 percent during the last quarter of last year. However, its
occupancy rate has fallen to around 50 percent since August this year.</P>
      <P>The occupancy rate of Caesar Park Hotel in Kenting also declined to about 60
percent over the past few months, according to Su Man-ping, a senior manager at
the hotel.</P>
      <P>In an effort to attract more business, Caesar Park will launch aspecial
promotion drive in November under which guests who stay one night will get a
second night free at the hotel at a rate of NT$3,999 plus 10-percent service
charge, the manager added.</P>
      <P>Kuo said Kenting is good place not only for water activities, but also for
migratory bird and hawk watching and is known for its natural landscape and
protected ecological areas.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT expels 7 mavericks over unauthorized electoral bids</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In a rare move to show its resolve to maintain party discipline, the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) decided Sunday to expel seven of its members after they bucked
the party line and registered as candidates for the year-end local government
chief elections.</P>
      <P>"We reached the decision (to expel them)  after extensive discussion, " said
Juan Kang-meng, director of the KMT's Evaluation and Disciplinary Committee, who
presided over a committee meeting earlier in the day to deal with the issue.</P>
      <P>"The committee agreed unanimously to expel the seven members as they have
grossly violated party rules, sabotaged party unity and undermined the party's
interests, " Juan said, adding that they deserve the harshest possible penalty
of expulsion.</P>
      <P>The seven mavericks included Legislator Fu Kun-chi and Hualien County Deputy
Magistrate  Chang Chih-ming,  both of whom have registered to run for magistrate
in the eastern county in defiance of the party's nomination rules.</P>
      <P>Also, former Legislator Wu Cheng-tien and Hsu Ching-ming, a writer, have both
been expelled, as they have entered the race for the magisterial position on the
outlying island of Kinmen without the KMT's endorsement.</P>
      <P>The three other members expelled are former Legislator Chen Chen-sheng who will
run in Nantou County; Lin Sheng-fen, a Chiayi city councilor who is making a bid
for mayor of the city; and Wu Fu-tung, a veterinarian who is running in Taoyuan
County.</P>
      <P>The KMT's decision Sunday came on the heels of a similar one on Oct.6 to expel
Hsinchu County Council Speaker Chang Pi-chin who refused to toe the party line
and insisted on running for magistrate in the northern county.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the Dec. 5 mayoral and magisterial elections are crucial to the
party's grip on power and the implementation of its platform on national
development, Juan said the KMT headquarters cannot afford to indulge members who
choose to run against the party's standard-bearers in public elections.</P>
      <P>Juan said the expulsions will formally take effect after they have been endorsed
by the party's Central Standing Committee which will review the disciplinary
committee's decision at an Oct.14 meeting.</P>
      <P>According to the KMT's membership regulations, members who are expelled cannot
apply for reinstatement until after two years.</P>
      <P>Asked how the party will deal with members who stump for the mavericks, Juan
said the party will also mete out the harshest possible punishment to them.</P>
      <P>In addition to electing new mayors and magistrates, the Dec.5 voting will also
include elections for city and county councilors as well as township heads.</P>
      <P>As six cities and counties -- Taipei County, Taichung City and Taichung County,
Tainan City and Tainan County, and Koahsiung County -- will be upgraded or
merged into special municipalities like Taipei City and Kaohsiung City, the
year-end elections will be held only in 17 cities and counties.</P>
      <P>A total of 54 hopefuls have registered to run for 17 mayoral and magisterial
seats to be up for grabs in the forthcoming elections. Competition in most
cities and counties are expected to be very intense.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has budgeted NT$77.4 billion (US$2.4 billion) for various flood
control and prevention projects to be carried out next year, a senior water
resources official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen Shen-hsien, director-general of the Water Resources Agency (WRA) under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, made the remarks at a national water management
conference aimed at fleshing out effective strategies to prevent recurrence of
the devastating flooding caused by Typhoon Morakot in early August.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the 2010 flood control budget will be used to finance various
river drainage projects, the dredging and cleanup of the Shihmen Reservoir's
catchment areas, as well as forestation, farmland drainage and water and soil
conservation.</P>
      <P>At the moment, Chen went on, 16 post-Morakot drainage and reconstruction
projects are in progress and are scheduled to be completed before the next rainy
season which usually begins around May.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot brought a staggering amount of rainfall to southern Taiwan,
causing serious flooding and landslides. Chen said more than 670,000 cubic
meters of silt and soil have been cleaned up so far.</P>
      <P>"Our goal in the first phase is to complete dredging of 25 million cubic meters
of silt and soil from riverbeds and reservoirs by the end of June 2010," Chen
said.</P>
      <P>According to WRA statistics, silt and soil accumulation has reached 60 million
cubic meters in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot, equivalent to the combined
height of 32 Taipei 101 towers.</P>
      <P>Chen promised that his agency will step up dredging efforts. The agency is also
considering establishing a bank-like mechanism to regulate the country's supply
of sand and gravel, he said.</P>
      <P>Noting that flood control and prevention require concerted efforts by the
central and local governments, Chen said overall planning and inter-agency
cooperation are needed to achieve the targeted goals.</P>
      <P>"Agricultural, forestry and river management agencies and local governments
should work in concert to prevent excessive or abusive development in
environmentally sensitive regions, such as catchment areas, mountains and
forested lands, " Chen said. Without close inter-agency cooperation, flood-
control projects will not prevent disasters, he added.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the conference, Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing said the
current pace of silt dredging in the wake of Morakot-triggered flooding and
mudslides is too slow.</P>
      <P>"At this rate, it would take an estimated 56 years to clear all the silt... At
this special time, we need special measures. The central government should
cooperate with the private sector and offer incentives to speed up the work, "
said Yang whose county was hardest-hit by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Pingtung County Magistrate Tsao Chi-hung said his county's aquaculture industry
was severely damaged by Morakot. "The government should consider how to use the
silt and soil brought by the typhoon to improve the environment for the local
aquaculture industry, " he added.</P>
      <P>The  WRA-organized  conference  brought  together  central and local government
official and flood-control experts to discuss ways of improving disaster
prevention and relief measures.</P>
      <P>Representatives of disaster affected areas, legislators, Control Yuan members,
academics and student representatives also attended the conference.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Wangyeh procession gets underway in Donggang</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A festive but solemn procession in honor of the deity Wen Wangyeh set off from
Donggang fishing port in Pingtung County Sunday, the second day of the
traditional King Boat ceremony that is being held by the local Donglong Temple.</P>
      <P>It is one of Taiwan's largest and most complex festivals and has been held every
three years by the Donglong Temple since the temple was established in 1706. The
festival culminates after seven days with the burning of an elaborately carved
wooden junk.</P>
      <P>The Donglong Temple King Boat ceremony began Saturday with a ritual to welcome
the god -- a ceremony that a local cultural worker Chen Chien-cheng described as
full of tradition and mystery.</P>
      <P>Wangyeh believers gathered Saturday at the temple, performing a 300-year old
ritual to commemorate  five of Wangyeh's  divine followers.</P>
      <P>The King Boat rituals were originally meant to ward off diseases and evil
spirits, but have evolved into activities to pray for a healthy and peaceful
life.</P>
      <P>Historical documents show that the Donglong Temple in Taiwan was constructed
during the reign of Emperor Kangsi of the Ching Dynasty after the local people
saw signs that suggested the deity Wen Wangyeh wanted to settle in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In Chinese, wangyeh is a respectful form of address of the nobility.</P>
      <P>Wen Wangyeh, also called Wen Hong, was reportedly born in Shantung Province in
Sui Dynasty in the 7th century. He was given a high ranking position at the
imperial palace of Emperor Taizong in the Tang Dynasty after he saved the
emperor's life.</P>
      <P>Wen died several years later in an accident at the sea while on a patrol
mission. In the belief that Wen had become a god in the celestial world, Taizong
honored him with the posthumous title of "Dai Tien Hsun Shou, " which means
patrolling on the behalf of the God of Heaven, and ordered the construction of
temples in honor of Wangyeh.</P>
      <P>The emperor also gave orders for a King Boat to be built for the diety, and
instructed people to present offerings during a certain period, then take the
boat to the water and burn it as the greatest offering to Wangyeh.</P>
      <P>Donggang residents usually begin to build the wooden boat at least one year
before the ceremony. Using ancient techniques, they construct  a replica  of a
full-sized  imperial  cruiser with meticulously carved sides and colorful
decorations.</P>
      <P>The burning of the King Boat on the seventh day of the festival is a ritual that
is believed will get rid of diseases and evil spirits and also symbolizes
sending divine spirits back to heaven.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Health insurance premiums for high-income earners to be raised soon</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The health insurance premiums paid by people in high income brackets may be
raised in November at the earliest, Department of Health Yaung Chih-liang said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>"The insured income of highly paid individuals will be increased, therefore,
they will have to pay higher premiums, " Yaung told reporters.</P>
      <P>According to a plan drafted by the DOH's Bureau of National Health Insurance,
the insured monthly income of people in the most highly paid categories will be
expanded from 7.6 times to 12 times that of those in the lowest income bracket,
Yaung said.</P>
      <P>This means that the current insured income ceiling of NT$131,700 (US$4,090) will
be raised to NT$207,360, Yaung said.</P>
      <P>"The plan will be referred to the Executive Yuan for evaluation and if it is
given the green light, it will be implemented in November at the earliest,"
Yaung said.</P>
      <P>If the proposal is approved, about 80,000 people in the country will be affected
by the adjustment, he added.</P>
      <P>The move to increase the maximum insured income is expected to boost the annual
revenues of the financially  strapped health insurance program by an estimated
NT$1.3 billion, Yaung said.</P>
      <P>According to Yaung, the health insurance program's deficit will hit NT$50
billion by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Yaung had originally suggested that the health insurance premium rate be raised
from the current 4.55 percent to 5 percent of the monthly insured amount from
next year to help keep the health insurance program afloat.</P>
      <P>However, that proposal drew immediate fire from legislators from across the
political spectrum, who said that the time was not right for such a move. Under
pressure, Yaung shelved that plan late last month but said the DOH would
consider raising the insured income ceiling among the wealthy.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan will present a white paper on disaster prevention to the
Legislature annually as part of its efforts to minimize human casualties and the
drain on national resources, Premier Wu Den-yih said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the pledge at the closing ceremony of a national water management
conference aimed at mapping out effective strategies to prevent recurrence of
the devastating flooding caused by Typhoon Morakot in early August which caused
more than 700 deaths and huge property damage.</P>
      <P>Noting that the conclusion of the conference marks the start of action, Wu said
all administrative agencies should step up promotion of disaster prevention and
work to fulfill the government's core mission of protecting people's lives and
property.</P>
      <P>As part of the government's all-out disaster prevention drive, Wu said, the
Executive Yuan will collect information through as many channels as possible
about earthquakes and typhoons that may strike Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We will also come up with a white paper on disaster prevention annually and
refer it to the Legislative Yuan for screening, just as we have submitted an
annual national defense white paper to the Legislature over the years," Wu said.</P>
      <P>In addition to natural calamities, the white paper will also cover prevention
efforts against epidemics such as influenza A(H1N1), Wu said. Equal emphasis
should also be given to mitigating possible loss of human lives and the drain of
national resources that could result from natural and other types of disasters.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot-triggered massive flooding and landslides that left more than
700 people dead or missing and rendered thousands homeless.</P>

absolute truth that can order and adjust the great relations of human society,
fix the fundamental principles of morality, and understand the laws of creation
of the Universe."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chiang Pin-kung, Taiwan's top negotiator with China and head of the quasi-
official intermediary Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), returned to Taiwan from
the United Kingdom Sunday after attending a Tory conference in Manchester.</P>
      <P>Chiang attended the Conservative Party's annual conference in Manchester Oct.
4-9 in his capacity as a vice chairman of Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>He said he and two aides attended the meeting at the invitation of the U.K.'s
opposition Conservative Party, as both the KMT and the Tory are members of the
International Democratic Union (IDU).</P>
      <P>"Countries around the world have been paying closer attention to the Tories,
speculating that its leader David Cameron could win the general election next
June to become Britain's next prime minister, " Chiang said upon arrival at the
Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport.</P>
      <P>Cameron received a popularity boost following his speech at the Conservative
Party conference,  according  to the latest  Sky News/YouGov poll. Tory support
jumped 4 percent to 44 percent, while support for Labour fell to 27 percent,
according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Chiang  said he took the opportunity  to attend the Tory conference, which drew
the participation of representatives from many other IDU member countries, to
present information about President Ma Ying-jeou's cross-strait policies,  the
administration's  policy achievements and its prospects for the future.</P>
      <P>He said he worked 20 hours during his two nights in Manchester, meeting a total
of 24 delegates from IDU member countries, trying hard to inform them about
Taiwan and what the ruling KMT is doing in its efforts to improve cross-Taiwan
Strait relations.</P>
      <P>The SEF chairman, however, said he was saddened to note that some people back
home did not appreciate his efforts on the nation's behalf, and instead focused
on trivial matters like who paid the airfares for him and his two aides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Prevention better than cure in case of natural disasters: president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11 (CNA)
10/11/09  17:27:26
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou called Sunday for the country to avoid challenging nature
and said it is better to prevent natural disasters than to deal with their
aftermath.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of a national flood control conference in Taipei, Ma said
that natural resources are scarce in Taiwan, but natural disasters abound and
are an ever-present threat.</P>
      <P>Quoting government statistics, he said that 73 percent of the Republic of
China's territory and its population are constantly under threat from
earthquakes, flooding, typhoons and mudslides.</P>
      <P>He noted that, according to Nature magazine,  the surface temperature of
tropical oceans has increased by 0.5 degrees Celsius over the past 30 years,
resulting in the formation of 75 percent more powerful and potentially
destructive typhoons in the northwest Pacific.</P>
      <P>He said the power of the typhoons that have affected Taiwan has increased, as
has the volume of rainfall in the country over the past 20 years.</P>
      <P>In the 20th century, global temperatures edged up by 0.74 degrees on average,
but in Taiwan the increase was 1.2 degrees, which is one of the major reasons
why the typhoon threat is more devastating, he added.</P>
      <P>Citing precipitation records, he said that when the devastating Typhoon Herb
struck Taiwan in 1996, it brought torrential rainfall of more than 1987 mm, but
by 2001 when Typhoon Nari wreaked havoc on Taiwan the precipitation level from
that storm was 2319 mm. When Typhoon Morakot hit in August this year, the
rainfall it brought was an astounding 2965 mm, he noted.</P>
      <P>Natural disasters are unavoidable, but what the government can do is bolster
preventive and control measures in advance, he said.</P>
      <P>Mother Nature often does not give people time to escape, he said, pointing out
that mountain residents and people living near rivers had no time to flee, nor
could they be saved, when the mudslides triggered by Typhoon Morakot struck.</P>
      <P>"There was not even 72 seconds, let alone the so-called golden 72 hours, to save
them," he said</P>
      <P>When the magnitude 7.3 killer earthquake hit on Sept. 21, 1999, 38 rescue teams
from 21 countries came to Taiwan's aid. But there was no such aid from abroad in
the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot this August. "Few rescue teams would mobilize
for typhoon relief, " he noted.</P>
      <P>He said that fatalities from Typhoon Morakot could have been as high as 1,046 if
rural township and village officials did not have effective evacuation plans in
place.</P>
      <P>The president spent days and nights in flood-affected areas in eastern and
southern Taiwan in August in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot, which killed more
than 600 people and destroyed numerous villages.</P>
      <P>"The damage that Typhoon Morakot wrought was far beyond our imagination," he
said, recalling that a house located 100 meters from a river in the central
county of Nantou was washed away before anyone realized the danger.</P>
      <P>Evacuating or keeping away from risky places is one of the ways of avoiding
damage from natural disasters, but this is not always possible, he said.</P>
      <P>"This is the purpose of the national flood control conference, " he said. "I
look forward to seeing the start rather the end of discussions at this
conference, and hope to see the development of viable strategies that could be
used by the government as reference in its effort to improve flood control and
prevention."</P>
      <P>The conference, organized by the Water Resources Agency, brought together the
heads of 21 cities and counties and flood-control experts to discuss ways of
improving disaster prevention and relief measures.</P>
      <P>The discussions focused on post-Typhoon Morakot drainage and reconstruction,
measures to handle soil and silt buildups and disasters  in catchment areas,
flood control and water usage strategies to cope with abnormal weather
conditions, and the overall management of catchment areas.</P>
      <P>Representatives of disaster affected areas, legislators, Control Yuan members,
academics and student representatives also attended the conference.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Kinmen residents offered premium liquor commemorating old battle</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen, Oct. 11 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>In commemoration of a battle 60 years ago when the Nationalist troops defeated
Communist China's People's Liberation Army at Gunington in Kinmen, the Kinmen
County government is offering islanders who survived the wartime years premium
liquor produced by the famous Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Inc.</P>
      <P>A total of 24,809 residents on the outlying island will each receive a designer
urn containing 5 liters of premium Kaoliang liquor from the county government.</P>
      <P>The residents who will receive the gifts include those born before Dec. 31, 1961
and those with household registrations on the island before its special war zone
status was lifted on Nov. 11, 1992.</P>
      <P>On Oct. 25, 1949, a 10,000-strong PLA force that landed on Kinmen's northern
Gunington beach was defeated by Nationalist troops. The Guningtou defeat
frustrated the Communists' attempts to take the frontline post and guaranteed
the safety of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, the residents of Kinmen remained under constant threat of war for
decades. On Aug. 23, 1958, the Chinese communists started heavy bombardment of
the island. Between Aug. 23 and Oct. 5, 1958, more than 450,000 shells were
reported to have fallen on the island from Quemoy on the other side, and for
three decades until the early 1990s, the islanders would have to endure half an
hour of bombardment one day every month from across the waters.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen distillery was first built in 1952 by the military, and the premium
liquor produced from sorghum became extremely popular in Taiwan. Since the
distillery was privatized and renamed Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Inc., the liquor
has not only earned handsome profits for the company, also contributed to the
county government's tax revenues.</P>
      <P>Statistics released by the county government showed that in 2007, the
distillery's business revenues amounted to NT$11.2 billion (US$350 million),
with pre-tax profits totaling NT$4.38 billion. The distillery paid NT$4 billion
in tax that year.</P>
      <P>To spread the revenue, the Kinmen County government has introduced many welfare
programs, including free lunches for school children, monthly allowances for
senior citizens and housewives with young babies, free public transportation,
and subsidies for college students.</P>
      <P>On the ocassion of Chinese New Year, Dragon Boat Festival and Moon Festival, the
distillery would offer gifts of Kaoliang liquor to all households on the island.</P>

      <P>Hotel operators in southern Taiwan are trying to cope with a tourism slump in
the area by making good use of online social networks, such as Plurk and
Facebook, and launching various promotional offers to attract more visitors.</P>
      <P>Most hotels in the area have seen a significant drop in occupancy rates because
of the Typhoon Morakot disaster in August and a boycott of southern Taiwan by
Chinese tourists following a controversial visit there by the Dalai Lama last
month.</P>
      <P>Su Hui-yun, a marketing executive at Hua Yuan Hotel in Kaohsiung City, said
Sunday that the hotel's occupancy rate has been about 50 percent recently.</P>
      <P>In an effort to boost business, the hotel applied for advertising space on
Plurk, which provides free online social networking and micro-blogging services,
Su said.</P>
      <P>People who who send the hotel a plurk -- short message -- or blog via Plurk will
have a chance to win a free three-day trip to Kaohsiung, according to Su.</P>
      <P>Kuo Shi-he, a publicity executive at Chateau Beach Resort in Kenting, Pingtung
County, said that driven by the Taiwan-made box-office hit "Cape No. 7, " which
is set in the southernmost county, the hotel was able to maintain an occupancy
rate of about 80 percent during the last quarter of last year. However, its
occupancy rate has fallen to around 50 percent since August this year.</P>
      <P>The occupancy rate of Caesar Park Hotel in Kenting also declined to about 60
percent over the past few months, according to Su Man-ping, a senior manager at
the hotel.</P>
      <P>In an effort to attract more business, Caesar Park will launch aspecial
promotion drive in November under which guests who stay one night will get a
second night free at the hotel at a rate of NT$3,999 plus 10-percent service
charge, the manager added.</P>
      <P>Kuo said Kenting is good place not only for water activities, but also for
migratory bird and hawk watching and is known for its natural landscape and
protected ecological areas.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT expels 7 mavericks over unauthorized electoral bids</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In a rare move to show its resolve to maintain party discipline, the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) decided Sunday to expel seven of its members after they bucked
the party line and registered as candidates for the year-end local government
chief elections.</P>
      <P>"We reached the decision (to expel them)  after extensive discussion, " said
Juan Kang-meng, director of the KMT's Evaluation and Disciplinary Committee, who
presided over a committee meeting earlier in the day to deal with the issue.</P>
      <P>"The committee agreed unanimously to expel the seven members as they have
grossly violated party rules, sabotaged party unity and undermined the party's
interests, " Juan said, adding that they deserve the harshest possible penalty
of expulsion.</P>
      <P>The seven mavericks included Legislator Fu Kun-chi and Hualien County Deputy
Magistrate  Chang Chih-ming,  both of whom have registered to run for magistrate
in the eastern county in defiance of the party's nomination rules.</P>
      <P>Also, former Legislator Wu Cheng-tien and Hsu Ching-ming, a writer, have both
been expelled, as they have entered the race for the magisterial position on the
outlying island of Kinmen without the KMT's endorsement.</P>
      <P>The three other members expelled are former Legislator Chen Chen-sheng who will
run in Nantou County; Lin Sheng-fen, a Chiayi city councilor who is making a bid
for mayor of the city; and Wu Fu-tung, a veterinarian who is running in Taoyuan
County.</P>
      <P>The KMT's decision Sunday came on the heels of a similar one on Oct.6 to expel
Hsinchu County Council Speaker Chang Pi-chin who refused to toe the party line
and insisted on running for magistrate in the northern county.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the Dec. 5 mayoral and magisterial elections are crucial to the
party's grip on power and the implementation of its platform on national
development, Juan said the KMT headquarters cannot afford to indulge members who
choose to run against the party's standard-bearers in public elections.</P>
      <P>Juan said the expulsions will formally take effect after they have been endorsed
by the party's Central Standing Committee which will review the disciplinary
committee's decision at an Oct.14 meeting.</P>
      <P>According to the KMT's membership regulations, members who are expelled cannot
apply for reinstatement until after two years.</P>
      <P>Asked how the party will deal with members who stump for the mavericks, Juan
said the party will also mete out the harshest possible punishment to them.</P>
      <P>In addition to electing new mayors and magistrates, the Dec.5 voting will also
include elections for city and county councilors as well as township heads.</P>
      <P>As six cities and counties -- Taipei County, Taichung City and Taichung County,
Tainan City and Tainan County, and Koahsiung County -- will be upgraded or
merged into special municipalities like Taipei City and Kaohsiung City, the
year-end elections will be held only in 17 cities and counties.</P>
      <P>A total of 54 hopefuls have registered to run for 17 mayoral and magisterial
seats to be up for grabs in the forthcoming elections. Competition in most
cities and counties are expected to be very intense.</P>

      <P>Torrential rains in the eastern Taiwan county of Yilan Sunday caused flooding
and mudslides that disrupted traffic on a highway in the area and prompted an

      <P>Three Taiwanese scientists joined a Chinese expedition to Antarctica for the
first time Sunday, aboard China's polar research vessel the Xuelong that is also
carrying researchers from Australia and Russia.</P>
      <P>The three Taiwanese scientists are Hsu Ting-wei from Cheng Shiu University in
the southern county of Kaohsiung, and Kuo Fu-wen and Lin Chia-hsing from the
National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium in Taiwan's southern county of
Pingtung. The team will focus on marine biological research, according to
China's Xinhua News Agency.</P>
      <P>The icebreaker Xuelong left Shanghai's Pudong port around 10 a.m. carrying 251
scientists, workers and logistics staff from China, Taiwan, Australia and Russia
on an 180-day research expedition to the South Pole.</P>
      <P>It is China's 26th scientific expedition to Antarctica since its first one in
1894, and its largest in terms of the number of personnel on board the research
ship.</P>
      <P>The scientists are expected to complete 59 research programs during the
expedition -- the highest number to be attempted by China on a single mission,
the Xinhua report said.</P>
      <P>During the trip, two exploration teams will be sent inland. One will head to
China's Kunlun Station located at Dome A, the highest point on the continent at
4,093 meters above sea level, where more research equipment will be installed
for astronomical observation.</P>
      <P>The other team will be sent to the Grove Mountains some 400 kilometers away from
the Zhongshan Station to collect meteorolites and conduct other scientific
research.</P>
      <P>From 1998 to 2006, China has made four trips to the Grove Mountains  for
scientific  research  and has collected  9,834 meteorolites, the third largest

    <HEADLINE>NT$77.4 billion budgeted for 2010 flood control projects</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 11 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has budgeted NT$77.4 billion (US$2.4 billion) for various flood
control and prevention projects to be carried out next year, a senior water
resources official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen Shen-hsien, director-general of the Water Resources Agency (WRA) under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, made the remarks at a national water management
conference aimed at fleshing out effective strategies to prevent recurrence of
the devastating flooding caused by Typhoon Morakot in early August.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the 2010 flood control budget will be used to finance various
river drainage projects, the dredging and cleanup of the Shihmen Reservoir's
catchment areas, as well as forestation, farmland drainage and water and soil
conservation.</P>
      <P>At the moment, Chen went on, 16 post-Morakot drainage and reconstruction
projects are in progress and are scheduled to be completed before the next rainy
season which usually begins around May.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot brought a staggering amount of rainfall to southern Taiwan,
causing serious flooding and landslides. Chen said more than 670,000 cubic
meters of silt and soil have been cleaned up so far.</P>
      <P>"Our goal in the first phase is to complete dredging of 25 million cubic meters
of silt and soil from riverbeds and reservoirs by the end of June 2010," Chen
said.</P>
      <P>According to WRA statistics, silt and soil accumulation has reached 60 million
cubic meters in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot, equivalent to the combined
height of 32 Taipei 101 towers.</P>
      <P>Chen promised that his agency will step up dredging efforts. The agency is also
considering establishing a bank-like mechanism to regulate the country's supply
of sand and gravel, he said.</P>
      <P>Noting that flood control and prevention require concerted efforts by the
central and local governments, Chen said overall planning and inter-agency
cooperation are needed to achieve the targeted goals.</P>
      <P>"Agricultural, forestry and river management agencies and local governments
should work in concert to prevent excessive or abusive development in
environmentally sensitive regions, such as catchment areas, mountains and
forested lands, " Chen said. Without close inter-agency cooperation, flood-
control projects will not prevent disasters, he added.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the conference, Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing said the
current pace of silt dredging in the wake of Morakot-triggered flooding and
mudslides is too slow.</P>
      <P>"At this rate, it would take an estimated 56 years to clear all the silt... At
this special time, we need special measures. The central government should
cooperate with the private sector and offer incentives to speed up the work, "
said Yang whose county was hardest-hit by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Pingtung County Magistrate Tsao Chi-hung said his county's aquaculture industry
was severely damaged by Morakot. "The government should consider how to use the
silt and soil brought by the typhoon to improve the environment for the local
aquaculture industry, " he added.</P>
      <P>The  WRA-organized  conference  brought  together  central and local government
official and flood-control experts to discuss ways of improving disaster
prevention and relief measures.</P>
      <P>Representatives of disaster affected areas, legislators, Control Yuan members,
academics and student representatives also attended the conference.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Wangyeh procession gets underway in Donggang</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 11 (CNA)

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A festive but solemn procession in honor of the deity Wen Wangyeh set off from
Donggang fishing port in Pingtung County Sunday, the second day of the
traditional King Boat ceremony that is being held by the local Donglong Temple.</P>
      <P>It is one of Taiwan's largest and most complex festivals and has been held every
three years by the Donglong Temple since the temple was established in 1706. The
festival culminates after seven days with the burning of an elaborately carved
wooden junk.</P>
      <P>The Donglong Temple King Boat ceremony began Saturday with a ritual to welcome
the god -- a ceremony that a local cultural worker Chen Chien-cheng described as
full of tradition and mystery.</P>
      <P>Wangyeh believers gathered Saturday at the temple, performing a 300-year old
ritual to commemorate  five of Wangyeh's  divine followers.</P>
      <P>The King Boat rituals were originally meant to ward off diseases and evil
spirits, but have evolved into activities to pray for a healthy and peaceful
life.</P>
      <P>Historical documents show that the Donglong Temple in Taiwan was constructed
during the reign of Emperor Kangsi of the Ching Dynasty after the local people
saw signs that suggested the deity Wen Wangyeh wanted to settle in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In Chinese, wangyeh is a respectful form of address of the nobility.</P>
      <P>Wen Wangyeh, also called Wen Hong, was reportedly born in Shantung Province in
Sui Dynasty in the 7th century. He was given a high ranking position at the
imperial palace of Emperor Taizong in the Tang Dynasty after he saved the
emperor's life.</P>
      <P>Wen died several years later in an accident at the sea while on a patrol
mission. In the belief that Wen had become a god in the celestial world, Taizong
honored him with the posthumous title of "Dai Tien Hsun Shou, " which means
patrolling on the behalf of the God of Heaven, and ordered the construction of
temples in honor of Wangyeh.</P>
      <P>The emperor also gave orders for a King Boat to be built for the diety, and
instructed people to present offerings during a certain period, then take the
boat to the water and burn it as the greatest offering to Wangyeh.</P>
      <P>Donggang residents usually begin to build the wooden boat at least one year
before the ceremony. Using ancient techniques, they construct  a replica  of a
full-sized  imperial  cruiser with meticulously carved sides and colorful
decorations.</P>
      <P>The burning of the King Boat on the seventh day of the festival is a ritual that
is believed will get rid of diseases and evil spirits and also symbolizes
sending divine spirits back to heaven.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Health insurance premiums for high-income earners to be raised soon</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The health insurance premiums paid by people in high income brackets may be
raised in November at the earliest, Department of Health Yaung Chih-liang said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>"The insured income of highly paid individuals will be increased, therefore,
they will have to pay higher premiums, " Yaung told reporters.</P>
      <P>According to a plan drafted by the DOH's Bureau of National Health Insurance,
the insured monthly income of people in the most highly paid categories will be
expanded from 7.6 times to 12 times that of those in the lowest income bracket,
Yaung said.</P>
      <P>This means that the current insured income ceiling of NT$131,700 (US$4,090) will
be raised to NT$207,360, Yaung said.</P>
      <P>"The plan will be referred to the Executive Yuan for evaluation and if it is
given the green light, it will be implemented in November at the earliest,"
Yaung said.</P>
      <P>If the proposal is approved, about 80,000 people in the country will be affected
by the adjustment, he added.</P>
      <P>The move to increase the maximum insured income is expected to boost the annual
revenues of the financially  strapped health insurance program by an estimated
NT$1.3 billion, Yaung said.</P>
      <P>According to Yaung, the health insurance program's deficit will hit NT$50
billion by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Yaung had originally suggested that the health insurance premium rate be raised
from the current 4.55 percent to 5 percent of the monthly insured amount from
next year to help keep the health insurance program afloat.</P>
      <P>However, that proposal drew immediate fire from legislators from across the
political spectrum, who said that the time was not right for such a move. Under
pressure, Yaung shelved that plan late last month but said the DOH would
consider raising the insured income ceiling among the wealthy.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan will present a white paper on disaster prevention to the
Legislature annually as part of its efforts to minimize human casualties and the
drain on national resources, Premier Wu Den-yih said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the pledge at the closing ceremony of a national water management
conference aimed at mapping out effective strategies to prevent recurrence of
the devastating flooding caused by Typhoon Morakot in early August which caused
more than 700 deaths and huge property damage.</P>
      <P>Noting that the conclusion of the conference marks the start of action, Wu said
all administrative agencies should step up promotion of disaster prevention and
work to fulfill the government's core mission of protecting people's lives and
property.</P>
      <P>As part of the government's all-out disaster prevention drive, Wu said, the
Executive Yuan will collect information through as many channels as possible
about earthquakes and typhoons that may strike Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We will also come up with a white paper on disaster prevention annually and
refer it to the Legislative Yuan for screening, just as we have submitted an
annual national defense white paper to the Legislature over the years," Wu said.</P>
      <P>In addition to natural calamities, the white paper will also cover prevention
efforts against epidemics such as influenza A(H1N1), Wu said. Equal emphasis

      <P>A group of 54 people from around Taiwan embarked on a two-day volunteer holiday
last weekend on Alishan, Chiayi County to help clean up hiking paths and restore
the ecological environment there in the wake of damage to the area by Typhoon
Morakot in early August.</P>
      <P>The group was the first of its kind organized jointly by the Tourism Bureau of
Chiayi County, Alishan National Scenic Area Administration and Chiayi Forest
District Office under the concept of volunteer holidays.</P>
      <P>Volunteers would have the opportunity to tour scenic spots in the area and also
work on special projects, the organizers said.</P>
      <P>On the weekend, the 54 volunteers in the first group all paid the costs of their
Alishan tour, which began at the Fenchifu Station of the Alishan Forest Railway
system that has been closed since it was damaged by massive flooding and
landslides during the typhoon.</P>
      <P>The volunteers were divided into three teams, with the first one going to Shih
Jhao, one of the major tea-growing areas on Alishan, to help clean up tea
gardens and popular hiking trails in the area.</P>
      <P>The second team went to Kuanghua village to assist in work of restoring the
habitat of local flora and fauna, including white-faced flying squirrels,
fireflies and fluorescent mushrooms.</P>
      <P>The third team was assigned to clean up an antique locomotive in Fenchihu that
operated on the popular forest railway, according to the organizers.</P>
      <P>"It is a very meaningful experience," said one couple surnamed Wang. "Fenchihu
is where we spent our honeymoon. Now we are here to clean the locomotive, which
brings back so many memories."</P>
      <P>The organizers have recruited two more volunteer holiday groups to help with the
clean up work on Alishan, ahead of the planned reopening of the popular mountain
resort at the end of October. The next group will being work on Oct. 17.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Researchers at the Changhua County-based Da-Yeh University have recently made a
breakthrough in recycling CD/DVD ROM discs by using a leaching technique that
can clean all the coating from the discs in a few minutes without damaging them.</P>
      <P>The technique, involving alcohol and nitric acid leaching and supersonic
cleaning,  won a gold medal  at the 2009  Taipei International Invention Show
and Technomart in late September.</P>
      <P>The technique, which won patent rights from the Intellectual Property Office
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, was developed mainly by Yang Yu-hao, a
master' degree graduate from Da-Yeh University's Department of Environmental
Engineering under the guidance of department head Professor Lee Ching-hua.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the two sides of each DVD disc have to be separated then
soaked in alcohol for one minute and moved to a supersonic washing machine to
get rid of the memory dye and ink.</P>
      <P>The discs are then placed in a nitric acid bath and afterwards in another
supersonic cleaner to remove the protective coating and metal reflective layers.</P>
      <P>The second leaching is followed by a water wash, which leaves clean, transparent
polycarbonate discs.</P>
      <P>CDs can be cleaned the same way, but the processing period would be even shorter
as CDs do not have two sides that need to be separated first, Lee said.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, used CDs and DVDs are sold at about NT$15 (US$0.46) per kg on
average, but recycled discs that have been cleaned by means of Yang's technique
cost NT$45 per kg.</P>
      <P>About 60 million discs are dumped in Taiwan each year.</P>

      <P>More than 800 mm rain fell in Dongshan township in the northeaster country of
Yilan between Saturday and 11 a.m. Monday, the Central Weather Bureau reported.</P>
      <P>The CWB, which issued a warning Saturday against torrential rain in the area,
said that from Oct. 10 midnight to 11 p.m. Monday the six highest volumes of
rainfall in the country were recorded in Yilan County.</P>
      <P>Dongshan's Hansi had the highest volume of 855 mm, followed by Nanao township
with 728 mm, and Dongao and Sansing townships with more than 500 mm each,
according to the latest CWB statistics.</P>
      <P>The CWB maintained its torrential rain warning for the area Monday, saying that
the downpours were resulting from the convergence of Typhoon Parma's outer bands
and the northeast monsoon.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Yilan County government announced school and office closures in
Nanao township, with effect from noon Monday.</P>
      <P>Torrential rains caused flooding and mudslides in Yilan on the weekend and
prompted an evacuation advisory in townships that the Council of Agriculture
(COA) has placed on red alert against mudslides.</P>
      <P>A red alert was issued for 19 areas in 10 villages of the county Monday,
indicating that local administrations should evacuate people close to those
areas.</P>
      <P>The COA also issued a yellow alert for 107 other areas in Yilan and Hualien
counties, warning local residents to take precautions against mudslides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Betel nut tax revenue should contribute to land fund: COA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12  (CNA)
10/12/09  16:28:45
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top official in charge of agriculture said Monday that a proposed betel
nut tax, if levied, should be used to facilitate land conservation and
ecological protection.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting, Council of
Agriculture (COA) Minister Chen Wu-hsiung said that if a health tax on betel
nuts is imposed, a proportion of the resulting revenue should be put toward a
sustainable land development fund that is being planned under a draft bill to
help facilitate land conservation and ecological protection.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in response to ruling Kuomintang Legislator Ting Shou-
chung, who charged that land leased by the COA for forestation has for long been
illegally used to cultivate betel nuts and that the COA should contribute part
of any betel nut tax revenue to the sustainable land development fund, as a
means of "righting that wrong."</P>
      <P>Ting pointed out that betel nuts are grown on over 50,000 hectares of land
around the country, making it Taiwan's biggest cash crop.</P>
      <P>Ting accused the businessmen  of using land owned by the government for betel
nut plantations, which have eroded the land and made it mudslide-prone because
of the very shallow root system of the betel palm.</P>
      <P>He added that betel nut production and sales are worth NT$20 billion (US$620
million) a year and that chewing the carcinogenic nuts damages the health of
users, causing government expenditure on health care to increase sharply.</P>
      <P>According to the Department of Health (DOH) , around 5,000 new oral cancer cases
are reported each year, with an average of 2,300 people dying of the disease
every year, primarily as a result of chewing betel nut.</P>
      <P>Responding to Ting's charges, Chen said land leased by the COA to the private
sector totals over 70,000 hectares at present, only 3,000 hectares of which were
discovered being used "irregularly."</P>
      <P>"The COA has been cutting the area of irregular usage by a rate of about 500
hectares each year," Chen added.</P>
      <P>In related news, the KMT legislative caucus nixed a proposal by the Department
of Health (DOH) the previous week to impose a health tax on betel nut, saying it
would hurt the livelihoods of some grassroots residents.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus whip Lu Hsueh-chang praised the DOH's tax proposal, which
is aimed at protecting the public's health over the long run, as a good idea.</P>
      <P>But he said that the livelihoods of the people, particularly those at the
grassroots level, should be taken into consideration when a new law is
initiated.</P>
      <P>"At present it is inappropriate and unnecessary to impose a betel nut tax," Lu
argued.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 1.37 million betel nut chewers in Taiwan, according to
the latest DOH survey.</P>
      <P>Chao Kun-yu, a DOH bureau chief said that until the betel nut tax plan matures,
the DOH will accelerate its oral cancer screening campaign, as 90 percent of
Taiwan's oral and esophageal cancer patients are betel nut chewers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Security Bureau (NSB) chief said Monday that during the 15 months
since President Ma Ying-jeou took office, the number of cases of phone
monitoring has fallen and that he is willing to step down if the government's
wiretapping is proved illegal.</P>
      <P>NSB Director-General Tsai Der-sheng said at the Legislative Yuan that the
incidence of intelligence wiretapping since Ma became president has dropped
65.46 percent, while wiretapping in criminal investigations has decreased 56.99
percent.</P>
      <P>But most legislators  expressed  skepticism  that telephone eavesdropping
carried out by intelligence and law enforcement units has dropped, with some
even saying that their own phone calls have been monitored by the authorities.</P>
      <P>"I am willing to step down if the government's monitoring of telephone activity
is proved illegal, " said Tsai while responding to queries from legislators.</P>
      <P>His comments followed a newspaper report in September that quoted an anonymous
source at the monitoring unit of an intelligence agency as saying that
wiretapping conducted by intelligence agencies had increased over the past year.</P>
      <P>Tsai dismissed the report at the Legislative Yuan, describing it as incorrect
and irresponsible.</P>
      <P>Ma promised during his election campaign that there would be no more illegal
wiretapping if he was elected, and he reiterated his determination to end the
practice of illegal eavesdropping during his inaugural speech.</P>

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Monday:</P>
      <P>Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>Taiwan should do away with myths about China</P>
      <P>U.S. political analyst Philip Bowring said in a recent column in the New York
Times that as a state, Taiwan is not any more independent than Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>This is because of the pro-China mind-set in Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang and
profit-seeking business groups, as well as Taiwan's self-imposed sense of
weakness.</P>
      <P>If Taiwanese want to seek an identity separate to that of China, they have to do
away with the myths that Taiwan is inferior to China, that democracy is no rival
to dictatorship and that China's rise is inevitable.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Was ex-President Chen an administrator under the U.S. military?</P>
      <P>A court document revealed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the</P>
      <P>Armed Forces in Washington shows that ex-President Chen Shui-bian</P>
      <P>petitioned the court to ask President Ma Ying-jeou to release</P>
      <P>him.</P>
      <P>This shows that Chen will do whatever it takes to secure his release from jail.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed that Taiwan is under the control of the U.S. military, in
accordance with a 1951 peace treaty between the allied states and Japan, and he
learned this fact during his eight-year term as Taiwan president.</P>
      <P>Chen said he served as a civil administrator under the U.S. military and abided
by instructions from the American Institute in Taiwan while in office.</P>
      <P>Chen's arguments are absurd and have shamed all Taiwanese. It defies the
imagination to think that someone can concoct such claims. Chen has failed to
sell his tricks to the United States, but has hurt the Taiwanese people's
feelings, not to mention those who voted him into office as president.</P>
      <P>Chen may come up with more absurd schemes in his attempts to wriggle out of his
legal problems, but we doubt he would win any sympathy.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>KMT should be punished by voters for rigging elections</P>
      <P>The court has nullified the election of Kuomintang lawmaker Chiang Lien-fu on
charges of vote buying, which makes him the third KMT lawmaker to be stripped of
his seat in the wake of the 2008 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>There are still two others who are standing trial for vote-buying.</P>
      <P>This situation is an indication that vote-buying is a deep-rooted problem within
the KMT, which is trying to consolidate its grip on power in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Fed up with the KMT's dishonest tricks, voters shunned the party in the two
legislative by-elections that have already been held.</P>
      <P>However, that is not enough. We are suggesting a law revision that would require
a political party to fund the resulting by-election and refrain from competing,
if its candidate is found to have won a seat by means of election fraud.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Time for government to back off its controversial move to consolidate memory
chip industry</P>
      <P>A government plan to integrate domestic manufacturers of DRAM chips hit a snag
after the U.S.-based Micron opted out and pleaded with the U.S. Senate to
intervene, via the World Trade Organization, in Taiwan's proposed investment in
the Japanese chip maker Elpida.</P>
      <P>Although  local economics  officials  have argued that the government's plan is
to invest in Elpida rather than subsidize it, and will therefore  not run afoul
of World Trade Organization regulations, we doubt whether this will settle the
dispute.</P>
      <P>Former Premier Liu Chao-shiuan proposed the establishment of the government
sponsored Taiwan Memory Company to take over debt-ridden DRAM makers at a time
when the country was in the grip of the global financial crisis and the DRAM
manufacturing industry was on the brink of collapse.</P>
      <P>Now the global economy has turned around and the local chip industry is
recovering, Taiwan Memory Company is no longer necessary.</P>
      <P>We urge the Executive Yuan to review the outdated plan and consider scrapping it
altogether.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) has been making  preparations  to help local
and particularly  private universities, to gradually leave the education market
in the event that they continue to fail to recruit enough students, Education
Minister Wu Ching-chi said Monday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a Legislative Yuan committee session, Wu said the MOE has made the
preparations in view of the fact that an exit mechanism will be necessary sooner
or later as enrollments in privately run colleges and universities continue to
decline.</P>
      <P>According to a recent MOE report, enrollments in privately run tertiary
education institutes have continued to decline over the past two years, with
enrollments falling short of the target by 6,802 in the 2009 school year.</P>
      <P>By 2012, private colleges and universities will have suffered a combined
enrollment shortfall of 71,000 if the shortfall increases by a rate of 2 percent
annually, according to the report.</P>
      <P>For the worst-case scenarios, the report said, the ministry will put forth
regulations regarding how students should be transferred, how faculty should be
laid off and how the ministry  should financially assist those institutes that
are forced to close.</P>
      <P>The MOE unveiled a package of regulations in June to pave the way for local
universities that have failed ministry evaluations or are unable to recruit
enough students to gradually exit the education market.</P>
      <P>Under the new regulations, universities that fail to recruit up to 70 percent of
their officially approved student numbers for three consecutive years will have
their annual quotas cut by between 10 percent and 30 percent.</P>
      <P>As a result of the regulations, no local universities will see their student
quotas slashed until the 2011 school year, which critics say will hold back
domestic education reforms.</P>
      <P>Twenty-four of the 162 universities and technology institutes in Taiwan -- all
privately run -- saw their freshmen registration rates fall short of the 70
percent target in the 2008 school year, with one of them even having a miserable
registration rate of just 11.62 percent.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese deep-sea fishing boat hijacked by Somali pirates in the Indian Ocean
in April is still docked in Somalia but its crew is safe, Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Henry Chen said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after the Taipei-based China Times daily reported that
same day that the Win Far 161, a tuna longliner, has been used by Somali pirates
to attack foreign merchant vessels and even to open fire upon U.S. military
aircraft.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the paper said, the 700-ton ship has been detained by the coast guard
authorities of the Indian Ocean island state of Seychelles since Oct. 10</P>
      <P>"The report is inaccurate, " Chen said. "Through contacts with the shipowner,
the Fisheries Agency under Taiwan's Council of Agriculture and several
international maritime trade organizations, we are pretty sure that the ship
remains intact in a Somali port that is being closely monitored by naval vessels
from many countries."</P>
      <P>Chen further said the Taiwanese shipowner is still negotiating with Somali
pirates over the amount of ransom needed to get the vessel back. "No progress
has been made in this regard," he added.</P>
      <P>As to when a result can be achieved, Chen said the ministry is not in a position
to speculate or predict because the shipowner prefers to maintain a low profile.</P>
      <P>The Win Far 161 was hijacked near an island in the Seychelles April 6.</P>
      <P>Of its 30-strong crew, the ship's skipper and first engineer are Taiwanese,
while five other are Chinese, 17 are Filipinos and six are Indonesian.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, fishery executives in the southern port city of Kaohsiung -- the hub
of Taiwan's deep sea fishing industry -- said rampant piracy has affected the
local tuna fishing operations in the Indian Ocean.</P>
      <P>Edward C. C. Huang, general secretary of the Taiwan Deep Sea Tuna Long Line Boat
Owners and Exporters Association, said that although there has been no
convincing evidence proving that climate change in recent years has affected
deep sea tuna fishing, piracy in the Indian Ocean has definitely hindered local
longliners' operations.</P>
      <P>"About 150 Taiwan longliners embark from Kaohsiung for the Indian Ocean every
year, " Huang said. "Concern about attacks by pirates has prevented our member
boats from approaching certain waters, thus affecting their catches."</P>
      <P>Asked about the extent of the influence,  Huang said the association had yet to
come up with comprehensive statistics.</P>
      <P>He suggested that local fishing boats operating in the Indian Ocean should
assign sailors to stand guard at bow and stern to warn about suspicious ships
trying to close with their vessels.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Falun Gong founder not welcome at this time: Taiwan's NSC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12 (CNA)
10/12/09  19:00:32
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's National Security Council (NSC) director said Monday that now is not an
appropriate time for Li Hongzhi, the founder of the Falun Gong movement which is
banned in China, to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Director Tsai Teh-sheng cited national interest and security considerations as
reasons why the government would not grant Li a visa if he were to apply for
one.</P>
      <P>Li's visit will "damage the cross-Taiwan Strait ties, " Tsai said in a
Legislative Yuan committee meeting, referring to Taiwan's relations with China.</P>
      <P>Beijing in 1999 branded the spiritual group as an evil cult and had since
carried out a nationwide campaign to detain, reeducate and jail Falun Gong
members. Li, a Chinese native who founded the group, is based in the United
States.</P>
      <P>A local newspaper  reported last week that the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) planned to invite Li to visit Taiwan, as it did for the exiled
Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama, who visited the island in late August to
console Typhoon Morakot victims. The opposition party, however, has denied the
report.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, legislators at the legislative National Defense Committee meeting
on Monday asked the NSC director about the issue.</P>
      <P>Tsai was answering questions from DPP Legislator Tsai Huang-liang at the
meeting. The official was invited to brief the legislators on the country's
intelligence gathering and national security work.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the government is treating Falun Gong as an evil cult, director
Tsai denied the suggestion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, on the question of whether the NSC considers the exiled Uighur rights
activist Rebiya Kadeer as a "terrorist", given that the government has rejected
an application by the World Uyghur Congress president to visit Taiwan, Tsai said
"No."</P>
      <P>Rebiya Kadeer was recently invited by human rights and anti-China groups to
visit Taiwan to raise public awareness about the plight of the Uighur people in
China, but Taiwan's government refused to allow her to visit, citing national
security concerns.</P>
      <P>China has accused Rebiya Kadeer of orchestrating the July ethnic riots in
Xinjiang that killed around 200 people. She has denied the accusations and said
she does not support violence.</P>
      <P>NSC director Tsai also said the NSC does not consider Dolkun Isa, secretary-
general of the World Uyghur Congress, as a terrorist, but pointed out that
Dolkun Isa has been placed on Interpol's red alert list.</P>
      <P>Interpol, an international crime fighting organization, however, states on its
website that people placed on its red alert list should be considered innocent
until proven guilty. The list is simply a way to announce to other countries
that a particular country is seeking to arrest and extradite such a person. In
this case that country was China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government was strongly criticized by the DPP for barring Rebiya Kadeer
from visiting Taiwan. She has expressed indignation at the government accusing
her group of having close links to an organization listed as being a terrorist
organization by the U.S. government.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese government's snub of the Uighur activist was criticized as a move
to please China, which not only runs counter to Taiwan's principles as a free
and democratic nation, but also contravenes the universal value of human rights.</P>
      <P>In  September,  however,  the  Kuomintang-led  Taiwanese administration allowed
the Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama to visit Taiwan, to the surprise of
some. China considers him a separatist and routinely opposes his overseas
visits.</P>
      <P>The granting of the visit by the Dalai Lama came as Taiwan's government faced
widespread criticism for its response to Typhoon Morakot, which was criticized
as being slow and inadequate.</P>
      <P>However, the moves by DPP officials and other groups to invite the Dalai Lama
and Rebiya Kadeer here have been criticized as attempts to create politically
awkward situations for President Ma Ying-jeou, who has been trying to reduce
tensions and improve ties with China since taking office in 2008.</P>

      <P>An intern selected from among more than a million candidates in China, 24-year-
old Luo Xingcheng, said Monday that he considers himself lucky to have had the
chance to observe cross-Taiwan Strait differences for two months.</P>
      <P>He was among a group of interns sponsored in 2009 by the Mainland Affairs
Council, which provided each of them with a round-trip flight ticket, a monthly
allowance of NT$20,000 (US$620) and a materials subsidy of NT$20,000.</P>
      <P>Luo, a graduate student from Nankai University in northern China's Tianjin
Province, said he came to experience Taiwan and found that the differences
between  Taiwan  and China are obvious, particularly in education and the
media's work environment.</P>
      <P>"The impact on me was huge, " Luo said, adding that "Taiwan's media developed
earlier so it has become more mature and is more objective in handling news
issues."</P>
      <P>Luo and seven other interns were received as the first group of interns for 2009
by Chinese Culture University College of Journalism and Communication. They were
scheduled to return to China Wednesday following their stay, which included a
two-week trip around Taiwan, a month-long internship in media organizations, and
two weeks for essay-writing. The next group of eight interns were scheduled to
arrive Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hsia Shi-fen, a staff member from Chinese Culture University, said the interns
got a very good impression of Taiwan and the Taiwanese people, and also
experienced the country's open media environment during their stay.</P>
      <P>After two months in the company of the Chinese interns, Hsia went on, some of
the local students have also altered their impressions about Chinese students.</P>
      <P>"The Taiwanese students thought the Chinese visitors would not be well off, but
in fact they were quite willing to spend money, "Hsia added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tourism Bureau to promote special tours for Chinese seniors</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Tourism Bureau said Monday it is planning unique tour packages targeted
at tens of millions of senior citizens from China and will invite a Chinese
delegation to Taiwan next month to learn more about the proposed itineraries.</P>
      <P>Tourism Bureau Director-General Janice Lai said the focus of the senior tours
will be "walking slower, eating softer, living better, and exploring deeper" to
give seniors a quality travel experience instead of forcing them to see Taiwan
at a breakneck pace, as is often the case at present.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau believes the market potential is enormous, estimating that
there are at least tens of millions seniors in China who have the ability to
come to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wayne Liu, chief secretary of the Tourism Bureau, said the so-called Sunset Glow
tours will not rush seniors around the island but rather give them the option of
leisurely exploring either Taiwan's east or west coast.</P>
      <P>East line tourists will travel along Taiwan's rugged east coast and visit famous
spots such as the popular singer Teresa Teng's grave, Taroko National Park, the
Chihpen hot springs, and Taitung County's Sansiantai (a group of rocky islets
surrounded by coral reefs). They will also enjoy views of the Pacific Ocean.</P>
      <P>"To some seniors living in China, this may be their only chance to see the
Pacific Ocean," Liu said.</P>
      <P>The west line tourists will visit the Lin Yu-tang House on Yangminshan outside
Taipei, Chang Syue-Liang's house in Hsinchu, Taipei 101, Sun Moon Lake and
Alishan, he added.</P>
      <P>According to Tourism Bureau statistics, 30 percent of the Chinese nationals who
have visited Taiwan since restrictions were loosened on such visits in the
middle of 2008 have been above the age of 60, and Liu believes they remain a
prime marketing target.</P>
      <P>"This group of people especially has a sense of urgency to visit Taiwan," Liu
said.</P>
      <P>Considering the extra manpower needed to handle elderly tourists, the Tourism
Bureau will subsidize the addition of a junior tour guide to every senior tour,
a program that it believes will also help train less experienced guides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to discontinue work subsidy program next year: minister</HEADLINE>

      <P>The government will not extend a program that has provided supplementary income
to working-class families that earned low wages during the recession, a top
official announced Monday.</P>
      <P>The "working subsidy" project, which was launched last October, will not be
extended after it expires at the end of December this year, as Taiwan's economy
is expected to bottom out of recession and post positive growth next year,
Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah said.</P>
      <P>Under this special welfare project, the government offers special subsidies for
households that are not eligible to receive regular government financial aid for
low-income families, but face economic hardships due to the global economic
downturn and the ensuing domestic economic recession.</P>
      <P>The monthly subsidy offered range between NT$3,000 and NT$6,000 (US$93 to
US$187) for people whose annual household income falls below NT$300,000 and who
have less than NT$3.9 million in real estate holdings. Many people have received
subsidies under this program.</P>
      <P>Jiang said Premier Wu Den-yih has promised that if necessary, the government
will use its second reserve fund to finance similar special welfare projects for
families in need of aid.</P>
      <P>Jiang made the remarks at a Legislative Yuan session where ruling Kuomintang
Legislator Cheng Ru-fen grilled him on why the Ministry of the Interior's 2010
budget for social welfare services falls below this year's level.</P>
      <P>In response, Jiang explained that the ministry's 2010 social welfare budget will
decrease by NT$19.2 billion (US$596.27 million) from this year's level mainly
because a sum of NT$17.6 billion needed for the "working subsidy" project has
been deducted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Jiang said that as of the end of June, 39,543 local families had
benefited from a special emergency aid project which was also launched last year
at the height of the global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>"This project will be continued this year and integrated with other emergency
relief programs," Jiang said.</P>
      <P>Regarding a long-term care subsidy project for disabled elderly people, Jiang
said the government's subsidy ratio will be raised from the current 60 percent
of the needed fund to 70 percent from next year.</P>
      <P>The program offers subsidies for at home nursing care for elderly people with
mild disabilities for up to 25 hours per month; 50 hours for those with medium
disabilities; and 90 hours for those with serious disabilities.</P>
      <P>Disabled seniors from low-income families currently receive full subsidy; while
those from medium-low income families receive 90 percent subsidy; and those from
average families receive 60 percent subsidy.</P>
      <P>Jiang said the ratio for ordinary families will be raised to 70 percent from
2010.</P>
      <P>As of the end of June, 34,527 elderly citizens benefit from this long-term care
subsidy program.</P>

      <P>The planned Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (TFDA) will be formally
inaugurated Jan. 1, 2010 and have a staff of 500 people, Minister without
Portfolio Chang Jin-fu announced Monday.</P>
      <P>At a meeting of the Executive Yuan's committee on strategies to develop the
biotechnology industry, Chang said that one of the new institution's major tasks
will be to set drug production standards and regulations in line with those in
other countries in the region, including China, Japan and South Korea.</P>
      <P>The initiative is an important part of Taiwan's preparations to introduce the
country's biotech sector in the international market, he said, because it will
make products developed in Taiwan more marketable.</P>
      <P>At the meeting, Yang Shun-tsung, an Executive Yuan Science and Technology
Advisory Group researcher, explained that Taiwan needs the international market
to support the high upfront costs in the biotech sector because of the
limitations of its own small domestic market.</P>
      <P>If domestic regulations and manufacturing standards conform to those in the
regional market, it can save additional testing costs, Yang said.</P>
      <P>Citing Switzerland as a model, Yang said that when a new drug is approved there,
it can directly enter the markets of 17 other countries.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan targets the Asian market as its major buyer, it must refer to the
relevant laws and regulations of countries like China, South Korea and Japan,"
the researcher said.</P>
      <P>On the same occasion, Kuo Ming-liang, head of the National Science Council's
Department of Life Sciences, revealed that the government is working to form two
biotech clusters to help transform Taiwan  into  a global  medical  engineering
application  and manufacturing center.</P>
      <P>The clusters will be located in the Hsinchu Biomedical Science Park in northern
Taiwan and in the Southern Taiwan Science Park in the south, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>The government hopes these clusters will help Taiwan boost its output of medical
equipment and devices to NT$250 billion (US$7.74 billion) in 2015.</P>
      <P>Kuo pointed out that Taiwan's medical equipment production sector had a compound
growth rate of 14.24 percent between 2003 and 2008, a rate of growth higher than
the world average.</P>
      <P>"It shows the great ambition of Taiwanese businesses," he said.</P>
      <P>Local producers of medical equipment and devices have never been properly
integrated, however, which is why the government is playing an active role in
bringing them together and helping them develop products that have potential on
the market.</P>
      <P>Kuo said the Hsinchu Biomedical Science Park will cater to the development of
sophisticated high-end medical equipment and devices in cooperation with the
strong semiconductor and communications manufacuturers in the neighboring
Hsinchu Science Park.</P>
      <P>As to the planned southern Taiwan medical equipment cluster, the government
intends to gather makers of products with dental, orthopedic or plastic surgery
applications, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>They will be helped by the many hardware, precision instrument, and chemical
material manufacturers in the Kaohsiung area, he added.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih proposed Monday that an old land reclamation project be
reactivated in Kaohsiung City using gravel and soil from Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Wu said the project, known as Nanhsing or Southern Star Plan, was broached by
former Kaohsiung Mayor Su Nan-cheng more than 20 years ago and also promoted
while he was mayor, but had been talked about less in recent years.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung City government, which has been controlled by the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party since Wu lost his mayoral re-election bid in 1998,
said in a statement, however, that the city has been carrying out a land
reclamation project in the vicinity of the old project under a different name
over the past decade.</P>
      <P>"The Nanhsing project has been superceded by the Dalinpu land reclamation
project, " the statement said, but the city noted that it would be pleased to
see an expansion of the project with support and assistance from the central
government.</P>
      <P>Over the past decade, the statement said, the city government has been working
on the Dalinpu reclamation project as part of its efforts to protect the city's
coastline and resolve the construction industry waste problem.</P>
      <P>"So far, 170 hectares of land have been reclaimed, but there is still ample room
to reach the target of expanding the stretch to 250 hectares by 2011," the
statement said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the statement said the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications is also carrying out a land reclamation
project in the Siaogang offshore area.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Siaogang project covers an area of about 300 hectares, the
statement said the region is home to the Kaohsiung Harbor Intercontinental
Container Center.</P>
      <P>Part of the reclaimed land has been used to relocate Hungmaogang village and for
Yangming Marine Corp.'s construction of container wharves, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot pummeled southern Taiwan with strong winds and torrential rains
that triggered the worst flooding and landslides in the country in half a
century.</P>
      <P>The Gaoping River in the Kaohsiung area has been seriously blocked by silt,
soil, rocks, driftwood and debris brought by the devastating typhoon.</P>
      <P>As the river's estuary is close to the Dalinpu or Nanhsing reclamation project
site, the statement said the city government welcomes the central government's
plan to expand the reclamation project using gravel brought by Morakot.</P>
      <P>As the development of Kaohsiung has been restricted by its limited land acreage,
the statement said, the proposed expansion of Nanhsing project will be able to
help attract more investment to the city, the second largest in Taiwan after
Taipei.</P>
      <P>The statement further said the Dalinpu project's 170 hectares of reclaimed land
will be used by the warehousing and logistics sectors and as a yacht industry
center.</P>

      <P>Taiwan can use its strong manufacturing capability to develop a medical
equipment sector and take advantage of a global market that could be worth US$2
trillion by 2020, Academia Sinica President Chi-Huey Wong said Monday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a meeting of the Executive Yuan's committee on strategies to develop
the biotechnology industry, Wong observed that Taiwan's biotech sector has yet
to take off because it lacks companies that can develop new drugs and produce
high-end biotech medical equipment and devices.</P>
      <P>That weakness could prevent Taiwan from grabbing a share of the global biotech
manufacturing market, which was worth US$800 billion in 2006 and is expected to
reach US$2 trillion in 2020.</P>
      <P>Wong believed that Taiwan did have some advantages in developing its biotech
sector thanks to the government's continued investment, related regulations that
are similar to those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and academia's
innovation and R&amp;D prowess, Wong said.</P>
      <P>He acknowledged, however,  that Taiwan is also beset with disadvantages. It has
few products that generate high profits, rarely conducts pre-clinical and early-
stage clinical trials and enforces laws and manufacturing standards that are not
yet in line with international practice, Wong said.</P>

      <P>Eight tons of relief goods collected by a Fo Guang Shan Monastery,  a Taiwanese
Buddhist  temple,  for typhoon-affected victims in the Philippines arrived in
Manila Monday.</P>
      <P>The Philippines has been hard hit by two typhoons over the past few weeks, with
nearly 1,000 people killed and more than 14,000 families left homeless and moved
to temporary shelters.</P>
      <P>In late September, Typhoon Ketsana battered Manila and nearby provinces. Typhoon
Parma, which first hit the Philippines on Oct. 3 but which returned on Oct. 8,
damaged large tracts of rice paddies that were to be harvested this month.</P>
      <P>Out of humanitarian  concern,  Taiwan's government  donated US$50,000  to the
Philippines  and solicited  donations  from nongovernment and private groups.</P>

that were transported to the Philippines in an Air Force C-130 transport plane
and arrived in Manila at 10 a.m.</P>

      <P>Every year when the northeastern monsoon blows in late autumn, townships located
along downstream stretches of the Jhuoshuei, Dajia and Daan rivers in central
Taiwan tend to suffer from serious dust storms, and this year has been no
exception.</P>
      <P>Among the towns hit particularly hard are Yunlin County's Siluo, Erlun, Lubei
and Mailiao townships located near the Jhuoshuei River estuary in south-central
Taiwan and Taichung County's Dajia Township at the estuary of the Dajia and Daan
rivers.</P>
      <P>"The dust storm problem is especially serious in riverside towns," said Yunlin
County Magistrate Su Chih-fen.</P>
      <P>The county government has sponsored forums at elementary schools in those
townships to teach schoolchildren how to cope with dust storm damage, Su said.</P>
      <P>Hsukuang Elementary School in Erlun and Fengjung Elementary School in Lunbei are
among the hardest-hit victims.</P>
      <P>Lin Huang-jung, the principal of the Hsukuang school, said the school has had to
spray water on its grounds frequently every day during the northeastern monsoon
season.</P>
      <P>"All classroom windows facing north have to be closed when the seasonal winds
blow, " Lin said. "Even then, our desks and chairs are often covered by dust."</P>
      <P>During breaks, schoolchildren play outdoors. "We invariably remind them to wear
facial masks, but our words often fall on the deaf ears of the young children,"
Lin sighed.</P>
      <P>Schoolchildren tend to return home with their outfits full of dust, the head of
the school's parent association said, and many students often complain about
sore throats and irritated eyes.</P>
      <P>Although the dust storm issues have existed for years, systematic efforts to
deal with them did not begun until two years ago.</P>
      <P>At present, two strategies are being tried to counter the dust storms, building
wind-breaking forests and building water-blocking dams to raise water levels and
thus prevent winds from blowing up sand from dry riverbeds.</P>
      <P>Officials from the the Fourth River Basin Management Bureau under the Ministry
of Economic Affairs, which is responsible for managing the Jhuoshuei River, said
the bureau has launched a project to plant 7 kilometers of trees along the
river's northern bank in Changhua County and the southern bank in Yunlin County
to shield the riverbed from the winds.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chinese interns see fruitful results from Taiwan trip</HEADLINE>

      <P>An intern selected from among more than a million candidates in China, 24-year-
old Luo Xingcheng, said Monday that he considers himself lucky to have had the
chance to observe cross-Taiwan Strait differences for two months.</P>
      <P>He was among a group of interns sponsored in 2009 by the Mainland Affairs
Council, which provided each of them with a round-trip flight ticket, a monthly
allowance of NT$20,000 (US$620) and a materials subsidy of NT$20,000.</P>
      <P>Luo, a graduate student from Nankai University in northern China's Tianjin
Province, said he came to experience Taiwan and found that the differences
between  Taiwan  and China are obvious, particularly in education and the
media's work environment.</P>
      <P>"The impact on me was huge, " Luo said, adding that "Taiwan's media developed
earlier so it has become more mature and is more objective in handling news
issues."</P>
      <P>Luo and seven other interns were received as the first group of interns for 2009
by Chinese Culture University College of Journalism and Communication. They were
scheduled to return to China Wednesday following their stay, which included a
two-week trip around Taiwan, a month-long internship in media organizations, and
two weeks for essay-writing. The next group of eight interns were scheduled to
arrive Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hsia Shi-fen, a staff member from Chinese Culture University, said the interns
got a very good impression of Taiwan and the Taiwanese people, and also
experienced the country's open media environment during their stay.</P>
      <P>After two months in the company of the Chinese interns, Hsia went on, some of
the local students have also altered their impressions about Chinese students.</P>
      <P>"The Taiwanese students thought the Chinese visitors would not be well off, but
in fact they were quite willing to spend money, "Hsia added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tourism Bureau to promote special tours for Chinese seniors</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Tourism Bureau said Monday it is planning unique tour packages targeted
at tens of millions of senior citizens from China and will invite a Chinese
delegation to Taiwan next month to learn more about the proposed itineraries.</P>
      <P>Tourism Bureau Director-General Janice Lai said the focus of the senior tours
will be "walking slower, eating softer, living better, and exploring deeper" to
give seniors a quality travel experience instead of forcing them to see Taiwan
at a breakneck pace, as is often the case at present.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau believes the market potential is enormous, estimating that
there are at least tens of millions seniors in China who have the ability to
come to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wayne Liu, chief secretary of the Tourism Bureau, said the so-called Sunset Glow
tours will not rush seniors around the island but rather give them the option of
leisurely exploring either Taiwan's east or west coast.</P>
      <P>East line tourists will travel along Taiwan's rugged east coast and visit famous
spots such as the popular singer Teresa Teng's grave, Taroko National Park, the
Chihpen hot springs, and Taitung County's Sansiantai (a group of rocky islets
surrounded by coral reefs). They will also enjoy views of the Pacific Ocean.</P>
      <P>"To some seniors living in China, this may be their only chance to see the
Pacific Ocean," Liu said.</P>
      <P>The west line tourists will visit the Lin Yu-tang House on Yangminshan outside
Taipei, Chang Syue-Liang's house in Hsinchu, Taipei 101, Sun Moon Lake and
Alishan, he added.</P>
      <P>According to Tourism Bureau statistics, 30 percent of the Chinese nationals who
have visited Taiwan since restrictions were loosened on such visits in the
middle of 2008 have been above the age of 60, and Liu believes they remain a
prime marketing target.</P>
      <P>"This group of people especially has a sense of urgency to visit Taiwan," Liu
said.</P>
      <P>Considering the extra manpower needed to handle elderly tourists, the Tourism
Bureau will subsidize the addition of a junior tour guide to every senior tour,
a program that it believes will also help train less experienced guides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to discontinue work subsidy program next year: minister</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12 (CNA)

      <P>The government will not extend a program that has provided supplementary income
to working-class families that earned low wages during the recession, a top
official announced Monday.</P>
      <P>The "working subsidy" project, which was launched last October, will not be
extended after it expires at the end of December this year, as Taiwan's economy
is expected to bottom out of recession and post positive growth next year,
Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah said.</P>
      <P>Under this special welfare project, the government offers special subsidies for
households that are not eligible to receive regular government financial aid for
low-income families, but face economic hardships due to the global economic
downturn and the ensuing domestic economic recession.</P>
      <P>The monthly subsidy offered range between NT$3,000 and NT$6,000 (US$93 to
US$187) for people whose annual household income falls below NT$300,000 and who
have less than NT$3.9 million in real estate holdings. Many people have received
subsidies under this program.</P>
      <P>Jiang said Premier Wu Den-yih has promised that if necessary, the government
will use its second reserve fund to finance similar special welfare projects for
families in need of aid.</P>
      <P>Jiang made the remarks at a Legislative Yuan session where ruling Kuomintang
Legislator Cheng Ru-fen grilled him on why the Ministry of the Interior's 2010
budget for social welfare services falls below this year's level.</P>
      <P>In response, Jiang explained that the ministry's 2010 social welfare budget will
decrease by NT$19.2 billion (US$596.27 million) from this year's level mainly
because a sum of NT$17.6 billion needed for the "working subsidy" project has
been deducted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Jiang said that as of the end of June, 39,543 local families had
benefited from a special emergency aid project which was also launched last year
at the height of the global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>"This project will be continued this year and integrated with other emergency
relief programs," Jiang said.</P>
      <P>Regarding a long-term care subsidy project for disabled elderly people, Jiang
said the government's subsidy ratio will be raised from the current 60 percent
of the needed fund to 70 percent from next year.</P>
      <P>The program offers subsidies for at home nursing care for elderly people with
mild disabilities for up to 25 hours per month; 50 hours for those with medium
disabilities; and 90 hours for those with serious disabilities.</P>
      <P>Disabled seniors from low-income families currently receive full subsidy; while
those from medium-low income families receive 90 percent subsidy; and those from
average families receive 60 percent subsidy.</P>
      <P>Jiang said the ratio for ordinary families will be raised to 70 percent from
2010.</P>
      <P>As of the end of June, 34,527 elderly citizens benefit from this long-term care
subsidy program.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan Food and Drug Adminstration to be launched in early 2010</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The planned Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (TFDA) will be formally
inaugurated Jan. 1, 2010 and have a staff of 500 people, Minister without
Portfolio Chang Jin-fu announced Monday.</P>
      <P>At a meeting of the Executive Yuan's committee on strategies to develop the
biotechnology industry, Chang said that one of the new institution's major tasks
will be to set drug production standards and regulations in line with those in
other countries in the region, including China, Japan and South Korea.</P>
      <P>The initiative is an important part of Taiwan's preparations to introduce the
country's biotech sector in the international market, he said, because it will
make products developed in Taiwan more marketable.</P>
      <P>At the meeting, Yang Shun-tsung, an Executive Yuan Science and Technology
Advisory Group researcher, explained that Taiwan needs the international market
to support the high upfront costs in the biotech sector because of the
limitations of its own small domestic market.</P>
      <P>If domestic regulations and manufacturing standards conform to those in the
regional market, it can save additional testing costs, Yang said.</P>
      <P>Citing Switzerland as a model, Yang said that when a new drug is approved there,
it can directly enter the markets of 17 other countries.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan targets the Asian market as its major buyer, it must refer to the
relevant laws and regulations of countries like China, South Korea and Japan,"
the researcher said.</P>
      <P>On the same occasion, Kuo Ming-liang, head of the National Science Council's
Department of Life Sciences, revealed that the government is working to form two
biotech clusters to help transform Taiwan  into  a global  medical  engineering
application  and manufacturing center.</P>
      <P>The clusters will be located in the Hsinchu Biomedical Science Park in northern
Taiwan and in the Southern Taiwan Science Park in the south, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>The government hopes these clusters will help Taiwan boost its output of medical
equipment and devices to NT$250 billion (US$7.74 billion) in 2015.</P>
      <P>Kuo pointed out that Taiwan's medical equipment production sector had a compound
growth rate of 14.24 percent between 2003 and 2008, a rate of growth higher than
the world average.</P>
      <P>"It shows the great ambition of Taiwanese businesses," he said.</P>
      <P>Local producers of medical equipment and devices have never been properly
integrated, however, which is why the government is playing an active role in
bringing them together and helping them develop products that have potential on
the market.</P>
      <P>Kuo said the Hsinchu Biomedical Science Park will cater to the development of
sophisticated high-end medical equipment and devices in cooperation with the
strong semiconductor and communications manufacuturers in the neighboring
Hsinchu Science Park.</P>
      <P>As to the planned southern Taiwan medical equipment cluster, the government
intends to gather makers of products with dental, orthopedic or plastic surgery
applications, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>They will be helped by the many hardware, precision instrument, and chemical
material manufacturers in the Kaohsiung area, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'Nanhsing' land reclamation project to be revived: premier</HEADLINE>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih proposed Monday that an old land reclamation project be
reactivated in Kaohsiung City using gravel and soil from Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Wu said the project, known as Nanhsing or Southern Star Plan, was broached by
former Kaohsiung Mayor Su Nan-cheng more than 20 years ago and also promoted
while he was mayor, but had been talked about less in recent years.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung City government, which has been controlled by the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party since Wu lost his mayoral re-election bid in 1998,
said in a statement, however, that the city has been carrying out a land
reclamation project in the vicinity of the old project under a different name
over the past decade.</P>
      <P>"The Nanhsing project has been superceded by the Dalinpu land reclamation
project, " the statement said, but the city noted that it would be pleased to
see an expansion of the project with support and assistance from the central
government.</P>
      <P>Over the past decade, the statement said, the city government has been working
on the Dalinpu reclamation project as part of its efforts to protect the city's
coastline and resolve the construction industry waste problem.</P>
      <P>"So far, 170 hectares of land have been reclaimed, but there is still ample room
to reach the target of expanding the stretch to 250 hectares by 2011," the
statement said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the statement said the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications is also carrying out a land reclamation
project in the Siaogang offshore area.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Siaogang project covers an area of about 300 hectares, the
statement said the region is home to the Kaohsiung Harbor Intercontinental
Container Center.</P>
      <P>Part of the reclaimed land has been used to relocate Hungmaogang village and for
Yangming Marine Corp.'s construction of container wharves, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot pummeled southern Taiwan with strong winds and torrential rains
that triggered the worst flooding and landslides in the country in half a
century.</P>
      <P>The Gaoping River in the Kaohsiung area has been seriously blocked by silt,
soil, rocks, driftwood and debris brought by the devastating typhoon.</P>
      <P>As the river's estuary is close to the Dalinpu or Nanhsing reclamation project
site, the statement said the city government welcomes the central government's
plan to expand the reclamation project using gravel brought by Morakot.</P>
      <P>As the development of Kaohsiung has been restricted by its limited land acreage,
the statement said, the proposed expansion of Nanhsing project will be able to
help attract more investment to the city, the second largest in Taiwan after
Taipei.</P>
      <P>The statement further said the Dalinpu project's 170 hectares of reclaimed land
will be used by the warehousing and logistics sectors and as a yacht industry
center.</P>

      <P>Taiwan can use its strong manufacturing capability to develop a medical
equipment sector and take advantage of a global market that could be worth US$2
trillion by 2020, Academia Sinica President Chi-Huey Wong said Monday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a meeting of the Executive Yuan's committee on strategies to develop
the biotechnology industry, Wong observed that Taiwan's biotech sector has yet
to take off because it lacks companies that can develop new drugs and produce
high-end biotech medical equipment and devices.</P>
      <P>That weakness could prevent Taiwan from grabbing a share of the global biotech
manufacturing market, which was worth US$800 billion in 2006 and is expected to
reach US$2 trillion in 2020.</P>
      <P>Wong believed that Taiwan did have some advantages in developing its biotech
sector thanks to the government's continued investment, related regulations that
are similar to those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and academia's
innovation and R&amp;D prowess, Wong said.</P>
      <P>He acknowledged, however,  that Taiwan is also beset with disadvantages. It has
few products that generate high profits, rarely conducts pre-clinical and early-
stage clinical trials and enforces laws and manufacturing standards that are not
yet in line with international practice, Wong said.</P>

      <P>Eight tons of relief goods collected by a Fo Guang Shan Monastery,  a Taiwanese
Buddhist  temple,  for typhoon-affected victims in the Philippines arrived in
Manila Monday.</P>
      <P>The Philippines has been hard hit by two typhoons over the past few weeks, with
nearly 1,000 people killed and more than 14,000 families left homeless and moved
to temporary shelters.</P>
      <P>In late September, Typhoon Ketsana battered Manila and nearby provinces. Typhoon
Parma, which first hit the Philippines on Oct. 3 but which returned on Oct. 8,
damaged large tracts of rice paddies that were to be harvested this month.</P>
      <P>Out of humanitarian  concern,  Taiwan's government  donated US$50,000  to the
Philippines  and solicited  donations  from nongovernment and private groups.</P>
      <P>The Fo Guang Shan Monastery responded by collecting eight tons of relief goods
that were transported to the Philippines in an Air Force C-130 transport plane
and arrived in Manila at 10 a.m.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Every year when the northeastern monsoon blows in late autumn, townships located
along downstream stretches of the Jhuoshuei, Dajia and Daan rivers in central
Taiwan tend to suffer from serious dust storms, and this year has been no
exception.</P>
      <P>Among the towns hit particularly hard are Yunlin County's Siluo, Erlun, Lubei
and Mailiao townships located near the Jhuoshuei River estuary in south-central
Taiwan and Taichung County's Dajia Township at the estuary of the Dajia and Daan
rivers.</P>
      <P>"The dust storm problem is especially serious in riverside towns," said Yunlin
County Magistrate Su Chih-fen.</P>
      <P>The county government has sponsored forums at elementary schools in those
townships to teach schoolchildren how to cope with dust storm damage, Su said.</P>
      <P>Hsukuang Elementary School in Erlun and Fengjung Elementary School in Lunbei are
among the hardest-hit victims.</P>
      <P>Lin Huang-jung, the principal of the Hsukuang school, said the school has had to
spray water on its grounds frequently every day during the northeastern monsoon
season.</P>
      <P>"All classroom windows facing north have to be closed when the seasonal winds
blow, " Lin said. "Even then, our desks and chairs are often covered by dust."</P>
      <P>During breaks, schoolchildren play outdoors. "We invariably remind them to wear
facial masks, but our words often fall on the deaf ears of the young children,"
Lin sighed.</P>
      <P>Schoolchildren tend to return home with their outfits full of dust, the head of
the school's parent association said, and many students often complain about
sore throats and irritated eyes.</P>
      <P>Although the dust storm issues have existed for years, systematic efforts to
deal with them did not begun until two years ago.</P>
      <P>At present, two strategies are being tried to counter the dust storms, building
wind-breaking forests and building water-blocking dams to raise water levels and
thus prevent winds from blowing up sand from dry riverbeds.</P>
      <P>Officials from the the Fourth River Basin Management Bureau under the Ministry
of Economic Affairs, which is responsible for managing the Jhuoshuei River, said
the bureau has launched a project to plant 7 kilometers of trees along the
river's northern bank in Changhua County and the southern bank in Yunlin County
to shield the riverbed from the winds.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Annual dust storm strikes Taiwanese riverside towns</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Every year when the northeastern monsoon blows in late autumn, townships located
along downstream stretches of the Jhuoshuei, Dajia and Daan rivers in central
Taiwan tend to suffer from serious dust storms, and this year has been no
exception.</P>
      <P>Among the towns hit particularly hard are Yunlin County's Siluo, Erlun, Lubei
and Mailiao townships located near the Jhuoshuei River estuary in south-central
Taiwan and Taichung County's Dajia Township at the estuary of the Dajia and Daan
rivers.</P>
      <P>"The dust storm problem is especially serious in riverside towns," said Yunlin
County Magistrate Su Chih-fen.</P>
      <P>The county government has sponsored forums at elementary schools in those
townships to teach schoolchildren how to cope with dust storm damage, Su said.</P>
      <P>Hsukuang Elementary School in Erlun and Fengjung Elementary School in Lunbei are
among the hardest-hit victims.</P>
      <P>Lin Huang-jung, the principal of the Hsukuang school, said the school has had to
spray water on its grounds frequently every day during the northeastern monsoon
season.</P>
      <P>"All classroom windows facing north have to be closed when the seasonal winds
blow, " Lin said. "Even then, our desks and chairs are often covered by dust."</P>
      <P>During breaks, schoolchildren play outdoors. "We invariably remind them to wear
facial masks, but our words often fall on the deaf ears of the young children,"
Lin sighed.</P>
      <P>Schoolchildren tend to return home with their outfits full of dust, the head of
the school's parent association said, and many students often complain about
sore throats and irritated eyes.</P>
      <P>Although the dust storm issues have existed for years, systematic efforts to
deal with them did not begun until two years ago.</P>
      <P>At present, two strategies are being tried to counter the dust storms, building
wind-breaking forests and building water-blocking dams to raise water levels and
thus prevent winds from blowing up sand from dry riverbeds.</P>
      <P>Officials from the the Fourth River Basin Management Bureau under the Ministry
of Economic Affairs, which is responsible for managing the Jhuoshuei River, said
the bureau has launched a project to plant 7 kilometers of trees along the
river's northern bank in Changhua County and the southern bank in Yunlin County
to shield the riverbed from the winds.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tourism Bureau promotes new alternatives for Chinese tourists</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  13  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau is considering alternatives to Alishan as potential
attractions for Chinese tourists in central Taiwan, as access to the mountain
resort remains difficult in the wake of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>So far, only nine-seat vans are allowed to ride on the partially opened road to
the Alishan National Scenic Area -- two months after flash floods triggered by
the typhoon brought the Alishan Forest Railway to a halt and seriously damaged
the mountain roadway.</P>
      <P>Tourism Bureau Director-General Janice Lai said the bureau will introduce the
Sitou National Forest Recreation Area in central Nantou County and the nearby
Shanlinsi Forest Recreation Area as options for Chinese tourists who intend to
visit Alishan -- one of their few must-sees in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Changhua County's Lugang, known for its more than 300-year-old Longshan Temple,
is also on the bureau's alternatives list.</P>
      <P>"The scenic attractions of Sitou and Shanlinsi are on a par with Alishan with
similar pure coniferous forests, while Lugang offers charms of a Taiwanese
fishing port in addition to its rich cultural legacy as an old town, " said Liu
Hsi-lin, chief secretary of the Tourism Bureau.</P>
      <P>Liu said he has recently taken representatives of China's travel sector to Sitou
and Shanlinsi to acquaint them with the areas and found his guests very
surprised and impressed by what they saw.</P>
      <P>"The crisis of Alishan could be an opportunity for other local tourist areas,
like Sitou, Shanlinsi and Lugang," Liu noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, since only nine-seat vans are allowed to drive up to Alishan at
present, the bureau has encouraged local travel agencies to arrange smaller tour
groups from Japan and Europe to take trips there.</P>
      <P>Responding to concerns that the number of Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan has
declined in recent months, Lai said she expects the numbers to rebound after a
group of 500 Chinese officials in charge of tourism and executives of travel
agencies visit Taiwan at the end of this month for a cross-strait travel fair to
be held at the Taipei World Trade Center.</P>
      <P>Chinese citizens have been allowed to make sightseeing tours of Taiwan since
July 2008. Taiwan in principle allows no more than 3,000 Chinese nationals to
visit Taiwan per day.</P>
      <P>In April, an average of 3,280 Chinese tourists entered Taiwan per day, but that
number fell to 1,500 per day in May and has averaged around 1,000 since,
according to Tourism Bureau tallies.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday that none of its
administrative personnel will face internal charges of negligence for its
response to the Typhoon Morakot disaster in early August.</P>
      <P>"The MOFA's merit committee, which met last week, decided that as former Foreign
Minister Francisco H.L. Ou and former Vice Minister Andrew Hsia both stepped
down to take political responsibility for the MOFA's response to the disaster,
no administrative personnel will be held culpable in the matter," said the
ministry's spokesman Henry Chen at a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>The committee's decision will be forwarded to incumbent Foreign Minister Timothy
C.T. Yang in the next few days for final approval, he added.</P>
      <P>The merit committee met to review the issue which arose from the Foreign
Ministry's  instructions  Aug.  11 to all its foreign offices to politely
decline any offers of help from their host governments in the wake of Typhoon
Morakot, which swept though Taiwan Aug. 7-10, killing over 600 people.</P>
      <P>However, a barrage of criticism by the media and the public over the decision
prompted the MOFA to apologize Aug. 14, saying that it was a "technical error
that occurred because of negligence."</P>
      <P>Ou and Hsia stepped down, while Former Premier Liu Chao-shiuan and his Cabinet
resigned en mass last month, to assume political responsibility for what was

    <HEADLINE>Using nano technology to lower joint disease treatment costs</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>A National Chung Cheng University (CCU) research program has created a technique
of using micro-nano testing to detect aging knee joints in the early stage in an
effort to reduce the high cost and medical burden of treating osteoarthritis
(OA) , a degenerative joint disease.</P>
      <P>With the new invention, physicians will be able to identify the source of the
chronic disease and perform treatment at its early and moderate stage using
minimally invasive procedures.</P>
      <P>Thanks to this, the more invasive procedure of replacement arthroplasty can be
limited, according to a CCU statement.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics released by the Bureau of National Health Insurance in 2002,
the university pointed out that the cost of prescribing  non-steroid  anti-
inflammation  drugs  for patients suffering from osteoarthritis  reached NT$2.3
billion (US$71.23 million) a year.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, there were nearly 12,000 osteoarthritis patients who underwent
surgery to have their bad knee joints replaced with artificial ones every year.
The cost of the medical treatment amounted to NT$1.7 billion, the statistics
showed.</P>
      <P>In total, the country spent NT$4 billion a year in treating the disease, the
statement said.</P>
      <P>In cooperation with the Joint Center of Buddhist Tzu Chi Dalin General Hospital
in Chiayi County, CCU researchers found that most OA cases could be easily
controlled with a cheaper minimally invasive procedure, CCU said.</P>
      <P>According to the statement, the research program combined major outbreaks of two
sub-research projects, with the first one conducted by a research team headed by
Jeng Yeau-jen, CCU vice president and a professor at the CCU Department of
Mechanical Engineering.</P>
      <P>Jeng's team has succeeded in using a nano-indentation measurement technique to
identify pathological changes of articular cartilage.</P>
      <P>As to the other project, initiated by Chau Lai-kwan, a professor at the CCU
Department of Biochemistry, the researchers have used fiber-optic localized
plasmon resonance sensors to measure the pathological degree of an aging knee.</P>
      <P>With the research results, the CCU-Tzu Chi hospital joint venture has developed
a comprehensive health care model for OA patients, using micro-nano scale
testing measurement, computer simulation model and biochemical methods to offer
improved OA-targeted treatment services and increase the recovery rate, the CCU
statement said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIG sells Nan Shan stake to Primus for US$2.15 billion</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.13 (CNA)
10/13/09  17:46:52

    <TEXT>
      <P>The American International Group Inc.(AIG) has agreed to sell its 97.57 percent
share of its Taiwanese unit, Nan Shan Life Insurance Co., to a consortium led by
Hong Kong's Primus Financial Holdings for US$2.15 billion (NT$69.3 billion), the
companies announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In acquiring Nan Shan, the Primus Financial consortium has agreed to maintain
the Nan Shan brand, the existing compensation and benefits package for employees
and the existing agency organizational and commission structure for a minimum of
two years after the transaction is completed, AIG said in a statement. The
current Nan Shan management team will remain in place, it added.</P>
      <P>"We are pleased to have found a buyer who shares our confidence in Nan Shan's
bright future, and who has pledged to continue Nan Shan's commitment to its
policyholders, agents, and employees, as well as to the people of Taiwan," said
Robert Benmosche, AIG Chief Executive Officer.</P>
      <P>Primus Financial  Managing Director,  Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer
Robert Morse said they wanted to develop Nan Shan as a Taiwan-based pan-Asia
financial services firm.</P>
      <P>Primus, established in April 2009 with capital in excess of US$1 billion, is one
of four consortiums that vied to acquire Nan Shan in an open bid on August 28.
The others are Cathay Financial, Fubon Financial and Chinatrust Financial, all
Taiwan-based companies. Primus and Chinatrust were most keen to acquire Nan Shan
Life, according to industry sources.</P>
      <P>Established in 1963, Nan Shan is the largest life insurer in Taiwan by total
book value and the third largest by total premiums, serving four million
policyholders via an extensive network of 24 branches, 450 agency offices,
approximately 4,000 employees, and more than 34,000 agents.</P>
      <P>The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including
receipt of regulatory approval.</P>
      <P>Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) Chairman Sean C. Chen said Tuesday that
if Primus is funded by foreign capital, the transaction will be examined first
by the Investment Commission of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and then sent
to the FSC for final approval.</P>
      <P>The FSC had laid down several conditions for bidders for Nan Shan Life,
including a commitment to keep the company for at least seven years and to
protect the interests of its employees and policy holders.</P>
      <P>Some DPP legislators expressed concern last month over the bid by Primus
Financial, saying that the company is financed by Chinese capital and has close
ties to Chinese leaders. They threatened to ask the Control Yuan to investigate
the FSC's legal liability if it failed to prevent Primus from acquiring Nan
Shan.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan laws, companies with Chinese funding are not allowed to
invest in Taiwan's financial institutions, including insurance companies.</P>
      <P>AIG said Blackstone Advisory Partners and Morgan Stanley acted as financial
advisors and Debevoise &amp; Plimpton LLP and Lee &amp; Li, Attorneys-At-Law
served as its legal advisors in the transaction.</P>
      <P>The New York based AIG was hit by a financial crisis last October and was forced
to get rid of Nan Shan to ease its own financial burdens. AIG announced in early
August that it would sell its 97.57 percent share of its Taiwanese unit.</P>

      <P>Graham Watson, a member of the European Parliament (EP), said that he fully
backs an EP campaign for Taiwan to join specialized U.N. agencies, such as the
World Meteorological Organization (WMO), according to The Parliament Website.</P>
      <P>Watson, the former leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe
(ALDE) from 2002-2009, told the website that he "wholeheartedly" supports a
growing European Parliament campaign calling for Taiwan's "meaningful"
participation in international organizations.</P>
      <P>"Given that Taiwan is still recovering from a devastating typhoon then, yes, of
course it should be allowed to participate in organizations like this," he said.</P>
      <P>In a Sept. 17 parliament debate, pro-Taiwan parliamentarian members proposed
that Taiwan should be allowed to take part in the WMO so as to help it better
deal with natural disasters at time of extreme climate change due to global
warming. Taiwan suffered the worst devastation in 50 years when Typhoon Morakot
hit the country in early August.</P>
      <P>Responding to the proposal, EU Commissioner Meglena Kuneva said the European
Union (EU) remains firm on its policy that it supports Taiwan's "meaningful"
participation in international organizations under "appropriate circumstances."</P>
      <P>Kuneva also promised that the EU will consider Taiwan's request to be covered in
the EU's visa waiver program, which would allow Taiwanese people visa free entry
into EU countries.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese authorities have recently announced that Taiwan would seek to enter
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICA0).</P>

      <P>Although the elections have nothing to do with the country, it may serve as a
straw in the wind from which one can see what tactics the party will use in the
forthcoming national elections.</P>
      <P>The role of the KMT Central Standing Committee is expected to be downgraded into
a rubberstamp of Ma's administration after Ma takes the helm of the party on
Oct. 17.</P>
      <P>Why there are still so many people vying for a seat on the committee? Probably
they hope to win favorable treatment from China when they do business in China
which mistakes the committee for the country's supreme policy-making body.</P>
      <P>Ma has vowed to push for reforms within the party, but if he turns a blind eye
to the widespread vote-buying in the elections of the Central Standing Committee
members, we won't take much stock in his promise.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Are the offenders too powerful or the party too feeble ?</P>
      <P>Both the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP)  have difficulty controlling the local factions that are rife within them.</P>
      <P>One day after the deadline for candidacy registration for the local government
elections, the KMT expelled eight members who entered the races without the
party's approval.</P>
      <P>The two parties' problems bear out the fact that elections are seen more as a
way to seize political resources and power than as a way to serve society.</P>
      <P>Both the KMT and DPP prefer to field candidates with the best chance of winning
rather than individuals they intend to groom as future leaders.</P>
      <P>So they cooperate with local factions simply for the purpose of winning without
regard for serving the people.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Without shame, President Ma pitches trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>President Ma made a pitch for trade pact with China while presiding over the
government's  lowest-profile  celebration of National Day in history.</P>
      <P>Ma's administration has never told people what the trade pact with China is for
other than claiming that it is inevitable.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Beijing is trying to close a noose around the neck of Taiwan
through a trade pact similar to that it signed with Hong Kong and Macau.</P>
      <P>So Taiwan is set to follow in the footsteps of Hong Kong and Macau and be
annexed by China.</P>
      <P>We believe the public should have a say in the matter via referendum and the
people should deny Ma's party their votes in the year-end elections to show
their disapproval of the proposed trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>From malicious politics to hatred democracy</P>
      <P>A Taipei City councilor of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party has
destroyed  a door of a Maokong Gondola station to demonstrate what he claimed to
be the station's lax security.</P>
      <P>His false claims  showed the seamy side of the country's democracy, that is the
opposition go all out to oppose whatever the ruling party does, without regard
to the impact of its opposition.</P>
      <P>Notable examples are the opposition's invitations to Tibetan spiritual leader
the Dalai Lama, Uighur activist Rebiya Kadeer and Falun Gong founder Li Zhihong
to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Another example is the disaster caused by Typhoon Morakot, with DPP accused the
ruling party of incompetency in dealing with it while the ruling KMT accused the
DPP local chiefs of failing to do their duties.</P>
      <P>We wonder where this form malicious politics and hatred democracy will lead the

    <HEADLINE>Far Eastern New Century reports growth in Jan.-Sept. turnover</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 13 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The total business turnover of Far Eastern New Century in the first three
quarters of this year was NT$13.65 billion (US$423 million), which represented a
growth of 2.12 percent year-on-year, company chairman Douglas Tong Hsu said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In addition, investments by the corporation in the cement, retail, and
telecommunication sectors in Taiwan and China are growing steadily, Hsu said at
a provisional shareholders' meeting.</P>
      <P>Since changing its name from Far Eastern Textile Co., the corporation has made
diversified investment one of its three principal business activities, he said.</P>
      <P>The corporation owns 244 affiliated companies, including nine listed companies
in Taiwan and Hong Kong, with a combined value of NT$94.4 billion, up from
NT$79.7 billion at the end of last year, according to Hsu.</P>
      <P>Regarding the subsidiary Asia Cement, Hsu said its annual output in China has
reached 20 million tons in the past, but with China's recent introduction of
total quantity management and control, its factory expansion plan has hit a
snag.</P>
      <P>However, the cement company's annual output could amount to 28 million tons in
2011, once it is operating at full capacity, he said.</P>
      <P>Asia Cement China is located in the central Yangtze River region and the Sichuan
region where demand for cement has grown substantially because of the many post-
disaster infrastructure projects that were launched in the wake of a powerful
earthquake in Sichuan in 2008.</P>
      <P>In the retail sector, Far East New Century has 43 operating outlets at present
and another six that are under construction and are expected to be completed
within two years, Hsu said. The six new retail operations will include
department stores in Chengdu in Sichuan, Wukesong in Beijing, Wuxi in Jiangsu on
the mainland, and Taichung and Hualien, and a 50-story office building in
Banciao in Taiwan, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Its affiliated Far Eastern International Bank, since acquiring American
International Group's (AIG's) Taiwan credit card business earlier in the year,
has begun making profits and is planning to venture into the massive Chinese
market once Taiwan signs a financial memorandum of understanding (MOU) on
financial supervisory cooperation with China, according to Hsu.</P>
      <P>Noting that it has been more than a year since the global financial crisis began
and that the worst of the economic recession may be over, Hsu expressed optimism
about Taiwan's economic outlook based on the stability of country's financial
system, its abundant liquidity and record low interest rates.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan pushing for endorsement of its bid to join U.N. agencies</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday that it is still pushing for
the endorsement of Taiwan's diplomatic allies of its efforts to participate in
two United Nations specialized agencies.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is seeking meaningful participation in the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO), according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>Joseph Y.L. Kuo, director-general of the MOFA's Department of Central and South
American Affairs, said at a regular press briefing Tuesday that Taiwan's
embassies and representative offices abroad are working hard to encourage
diplomatic allies to sign two position papers to be submitted to the ratifying
countries of the UNFCCC and member countries of the ICAO.</P>
      <P>"We have to maintain the momentum and the zeal, and continue to push (the bid),"
Kuo said.</P>
      <P>The MOFA announced Sept.  21 that Taiwan will strive for membership in U.N.
specialized  agencies,  rather than direct participation in the U.N. as it had
been pursuing in previous years.</P>
      <P>The ministry called for the UNFCCC and ICAO to give favorable consideration to
the needs of the Taiwan people and what they could contribute if admitted.</P>
      <P>According to the MOFA, as of Tuesday, 15 of Taiwan's 23 diplomatic allies had
signed a position paper in support of Taiwan's bid to participate in the UNFCC,
while 14 of them had expressed support in the case of the ICAO.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Taiwan should be concerned about the fact that some of the allies
have not come forward in support of its U.N. bid, Kuo said that it does not
reflect any change in diplomatic relations between Taiwan and those allies, some
of which have different political and economic concerns.</P>
      <P>Panama, for example, has not endorsed Taiwan's U.N. bid for years, as it has
said many times that while it maintains diplomatic relations with Taiwan, it
continues to develop closer economic relations with China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has not been represented in the U.N. since 1971, when the Republic of
China's seat was given to the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Since 1993, it has been trying to have the world body consider the issue of its
representation, but has made little progress largely due to China's obstruction.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's allies and supporters have been trying to get the General Assembly to
list Taiwan's application for admission on the U.N. agenda, but Beijing's claim
that Taiwan is part of China has prevailed.</P>
      <P>This year, Taiwan has come up with a more flexible and pragmatic approach that
it hopes will allow it to better negotiate the complex situation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A research team at Academia Sinica has discovered that the size of the sugar
molecules on the hemagglutinin (HA) protein in influenza viruses play an
important role in immune responses, findings that may lead to a new strategy for
the development of influenza, hepatitis C and HIV vaccines, officials said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The results have been published in the latest online issue of U.S.-based
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</P>
      <P>The study was conducted by injecting mice with different versions of H5N1
vaccines and exposing them to the bird flu virus strain, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The result revealed that mice immunized with vaccines obtained from the sugar-
modified HA had a survival rate more than double those that had been given the
non-modified version, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Also, the study found that the binding force between HA and human cell receptors
became stronger when the sugar molecules were reduced in size, and mono-
glycosylated hemagglutinin as a vaccine showed a stronger immune response.</P>
      <P>Che Alex Ma, an assistant research fellow at the Academia Sinica's Genomics
Research Center, explained that as conventional influenza vaccines are made from
oligosaccharide  HA molecules resembling those on human cell surfaces, they
could easily fool the immune system into becoming unguarded when intruded.</P>
      <P>By using the modified HA molecule as the vaccine, the immune system can fully
recognize the HA protein and trigger an alerting system that will not be
confused by the sugar disguise, Ma said.</P>
      <P>The study  demonstrated  that the removal  of structurally nonessential glycans
on viral surface glycopreoteins may be a very effective approach to vaccine
design against influenza and other human viruses, he said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Education Minister Wu Ching-chi said Tuesday that the country's second
five-year NT$50 billion program to upgrade the nation's universities into top
academic research centers, will focus on subsidizing top-notch, single-field
academic research.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a Legislative Yuan committee, Wu said details of the program were
being discussed by a group of professors and experts led by Wong Chi-Huey,
President of Academia Sinica, the most preeminent academic institution in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu said the program will mostly focus on subsidizing single-field research, such
as the cognitive neuroscience research at National Yang-ming University and the
photonics research at National Chiao Tung University.</P>
      <P>Each year, the program will provide NT$ 10 billion in subsidies, Wu added.</P>
      <P>Wong, the president of the Academia Sinica, has invited academicians and other
experts to discuss the subsidy allocation details.</P>
      <P>Wu said the first five-year NT$50 billion program to boost academic
institutions' quality will expire at the end of 2010. The program has already
met its targets, given the fact that National Taiwan University (NTU) ranked
among the world's top 100 universities for the first time this year.</P>
      <P>NTU took 95th place in the Higher Education league table of The Times of London,
compared to 124th in 2008.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Education Department of Higher Education Deputy Director Yang Yu-hui
has made clear last week that the second 5-year program will not just subsidize
NTU.</P>
      <P>If the government does so, there will only be one university in Taiwan that can
enter the top 100 universities list, she said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's gov't to discuss taxing overseas compatriots</HEADLINE>

      <P>Government agencies in Taiwan will discuss next week how overseas Taiwanese
compatriots should be taxed, the head of the Cabinet-level Overseas Compatriot
Affairs Commission (OCAC) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>OCAC Minister Wu Ying-yih said at a Legislative Yuan session that OCAC officials
will meet with officials from the Ministry of Finance next week to discuss
technical details of a statute which stipulates that Republic of China citizens
will have to pay a minimum tax rate on annual overseas income in excess of NT$1
million (US$31,000), starting Jan. 1, 2010.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) announced in September that starting next year,
Taiwanese nationals will have to pay a minimum tax rate on annual overseas
income in excess of NT$1 million.</P>
      <P>The new regulation will apply to Taiwanese citizens who live in Taiwan or
overseas and who have an annual overseas income of more than NT$1 million and
consolidated personal income of over NT$6 million.</P>
      <P>Wu said the OCAC will seek to address the issue of equity involving the
citizens' rights and duties.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks in response to ruling Kuomintang Legislator Lee Ming-hsing,
who said the new MOF tax law would legitimize the government to tax overseas-
residing ROC citizens, prompting some of them to think about renouncing their
ROC citizenship.</P>
      <P>Wu said he understands that it is unacceptable to some of the Taiwanese
businessmen operating overseas, including the Chinese mainland, that their
incomes derived from overseas are duty-free, but that they will soon be taxed in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu said, Taiwanese young men who had gone overseas to reside prior to
age 18 used to have to be conscripted into compulsory military services once
they returned to Taiwan after they were 18 years old or older, but such a law
had been changed and only those who return to live in Taiwan longer than 183
days a year will have to be conscripted.</P>
      <P>"Some of the overseas-residing ROC citizens hope that they be taxed only if they
return to Taiwan to live in their own homes in the country for longer than 183
days a year," Wu noted.</P>
      <P>The new MOF tax law defines overseas income as salaries and wages, interest,
rent, royalties, business profits, capital gains, professional fees, gambling
winnings, pensions and other income.</P>
      <P>Vice Finance Minister Chang Sheng-ford said that starting Jan. 1, a 20 percent
minimum income tax will be imposed on those who fall within the specified income
category.</P>
      <P>Only those whose personal income exceeds NT$6 million will be subject to the
tax, Chang said.</P>
      <P>For example, if the overseas income is NT$3.5 million and the consolidated
personal income is NT$2 million, the total amount will be NT$5.5 million and
therefore that person will not be subject to the new tax because their income is
less than NT$6 million, Chang explained.</P>
      <P>If people fall within the income bracket but are already paying income taxes of
more than 20 percent, they will be exempt from the new tax, he added.</P>
      <P>People who have been paying taxes in other countries on their overseas income
can file that as deductible amount on their taxes in Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>He said the new regulation is not expected to affect many people and will not
have any impact on capital repatriation.  The new tax will  be introduced  next
January,  and will not be applied retroactively, he added.</P>
      <P>Under the Act Governing Relations Between Peoples of the Taiwan Area and the
Mainland Area, income derived in China will not be considered "foreign."</P>
      <P>However, earnings from Hong Kong, Macau and the rest of the world will be
subject to the minimum 20 percent rate.</P>

      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) approved Monday a plan
that will allow about 80 percent of the country's hospitals to use an integrated
system of electronic medical records for patients, starting in 2012.</P>
      <P>Under the plan proposed by the Department of Health (DOH), about 60 percent of
the nation's hospitals  will be able to share electronically stored medical
records by that time, a DOH official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The plan, to be implemented between 2010 and 2012, is aimed at shortening
patient waiting times at clinics, avoiding unneeded duplication  of medical
tests and prescriptions,  and avoiding the unnecessary waste of medical
resources.</P>
      <P>The project will cost NT$6.04 billion, with the money provided from the budget
for a project to stimulate the economy and expand public infrastructure.</P>
      <P>There has been a legal basis for the establishment of an e-medical record system
since 2005, but for a variety of reasons, including inadequate incentives and a
lack of funds, the practice of computerizing patient records is not prevalent,
according to the official.</P>
      <P>The DOH hopes that up to 400 hospitals, or 80 percent of the total in the
country, as well as 14,000 clinics, or 70 percent of the total, will be using
e-medical records by 2012.</P>
      <P>Once the e-medical records system becomes popular, patients will be able to get
their medical records anywhere in the country simply by providing their National
Health Insurance IC cards.</P>
      <P>The DOH also hopes  the country's  hospitals  and medical institutions will
agree to shift to such a national system for providing and sharing e-medical
records, the official said.</P>
      <P>The e-medical records will include medical examination reports, imaging
pictures, blood test results and prescription records, as well as results of
examinations involving radiation, such as computer tomography scans and magnetic
resonance imaging scans.</P>

      <P>For many Donggang residents,  the 300-year-old Wangyeh festival, held every
three years, is an event passed on from one generation to the next, with many of
the official positions in the eight-day temple activity passed down from father
to son.</P>
      <P>For this reason, many children and teenagers can be observed serving in the
blessing procession of the deity Wen Wangyeh, which began Sunday in the Donggang
fishing port in Pingtung County, southwestern Taiwan, dressed either as "Bantou"
-- public officials responsible for maintaining order -- or "Jiaoban" -- sedan
carriers.</P>
      <P>Unlike the youth who take part in other temple activities, the young Bantou and
Jiaoban have inherited the "man-only" positions from their fathers or the elders
in their families, and are recognized by the god through a ritual, said 41-year
-old Su Po-wen, who has taken part in the festival with his Bantou father since
he was 5 years old.</P>
      <P>Su stated that if a Bantou has no son, he can pass on the post to the children
of his sisters, but the succession must be approved by Wangyeh. Applicants for
the position, or those who want to quit, have to ask for the god's permission
through the ritual of throwing two divining crescents on the ground, he said.</P>
      <P>In order to acquire the permission, the applicants must promise to serve in the
post and hand the position down from generation to generation, Su added.</P>
      <P>Asked why would he promise to be a Bantou in this way, Su said that "it is a
kind of drive to serve Wangyeh whenever the festival is held. Particularly at
the time of greeting and bidding farewell to the god, I would feel bad if I did
not come."</P>
      <P>The traditional temple ceremony to honor Wen Wangyeh began at Jhenhai Park in
Donggang last Saturday with a complicated welcoming ritual before the launch of
a four-day blessing procession.</P>
      <P>The ceremony culminates on the last day of sumptuous rituals with the ceremonial
burning of an elaborately carved wooden boat.</P>
      <P>More than 10,000 Wangyeh believers from outside the township, as well as curious
tourists, have flocked in Donggang to observe the largest and most complex
festival of its kind in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Some 52.5 percent of elementary and junior high school students in Taipei have a
habit of buying snacks after school on their way home, and their favorite
choices are fried chicken and shake drinks, the results of a survey released
Tuesday showed.</P>
      <P>This means that one in every two students aged 11-15 in the greater Taipei area
is at risk for gastrointestinal problems because of the unhealthy foods they
consume at the end of the school day, according to the survey conducted by a
Taipei medical university hospital, Shuang Ho.</P>
      <P>Some 40 percent of parents would not start paying attention to their children's
diets until the students develop gastrointestinal problems, the poll found.</P>
      <P>Yeh Tzu-chen, a family medicine doctor at Shuang Ho Hospital, said more than 60
percent of the snacks that Taiwanese students favor, such as fried chicken,
French fries and pearl milk tea, are high calorie foods and tend to cause acute
gastroenteritis in children. In addition, Yeh said, the pearl milk tea and
similar drinks sold by street vendors are usually unsanitary.</P>

lack fiber and vitamins, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>He cited the case of a female sixth-grade student who complained of abdominal
pains and loss of appetite and was found by doctors at Shuang Ho Hospital to
have chronic constipation. Her parents had taken her to the hospital on

      <P>The girl recovered within a week after receiving treatment at the hospital and

      <P>: The number of Taiwan citizens whose net assets exceeded US$1 million fell last
year by 18 percent to 58,000, according to a survey released here today.</P>
      <P>The survey by Merrill Lynch and Capgemini shows that there were 71,000
millionaires in Taiwan in 2007, and 66,000 in 2006. It attributes the decline to
the global economic downturn, coupled with challenging equity and property
markets.</P>
      <P>In the Asia Pacific region, Japan and China together accounted for 71.9 percent
of the total millionaire population and 65.8 percent of the region's wealth,  at

      <P>The number of millionaires in Japan last year was 1,366,000, down by 9.9 percent
from the previous year, while in China the number was 364,000, down by 11.8
percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>The survey also shows that the wealthy in Hong Kong took the hardest hit in the

      <P>A Taiwanese fishing boat on which there was a "minor mutiny" while it was
operating in the Pacific Ocean 10 days ago returned to Taiwan Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Escorted by a Coast Guard Administration (CGA) vessel, the Yu Chun No. 166
arrived at Chichjn Harbor in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, where its Captain Shih
Chin-hsing and Chief Engineer Tsai Ming-chih were reunited with their families.</P>
      <P>Shih said that he and Tasi were threatened by two of the 10 Indonesian crewmen,
who had armed themselves with knives, while their vessel was operating in waters
some 1,600 km off the northeastern coast of Taiwan Oct. 2.</P>
      <P>Shih and Tsai locked themselves in the wheelhouse and called their family via
satellite phone for help, prompting the CGA to send a vessel to its rescue.</P>
      <P>The captain turned the boat toward Japan's Ogasawara Islands -- some 1,000 km
south of Tokyo -- and asked the Japanese government for permission to dock
there.</P>
      <P>Shih and Tsai decided to sail for home after the Japanese authorities allowed
them only to moor 30 miles from the port out of concern by Japan's immigration
authorities on how to handle the boat and is crew.</P>
      <P>After meeting the vessel Oct. 9 when it was some 1,000 km east of Ouluanpi, the
southernmost tip of Taiwan, four armed CGA officers boarded the vessel, freeing
Shih and Tsai and subduing the suspected Indonesian crewmen.</P>
      <P>The two suspects  were later transferred  to the relevant authorities for
further investigation.</P>
      <P>"We were lucky enough to be able to come home unharmed, unlike the cases in many
other sea mutinies, although we did suffer a loss of NT$1 million as we caught
no fish, " Shih said after meeting his wife and son.</P>

      <P>Taiwan should develop and nurture its tourism industry, the head of a
prestigious business school located in Lausanne, Switzerland said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>John R. Wells, president of the International Institute for Management
Development (IMD), made the remarks in a seminar in Taipei presided over by San
Gee, deputy chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
      <P>Wells urged Taiwan to think about nurturing its service industry. Noting that
the government does have plans to upgrade its service industry, such as the
development of the tourism, medical and education sectors, he also said it
should take stock of developments in other countries, adding that if Taiwan
wants to develop its tourism, it could learn from the experience of Spain.</P>
      <P>He also said that if the people of China, with its population of 1.3 billion,
want to visit Taiwan, tourism revenues will be immense.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Institute of Economic Research President David Hong said on the same
occasion that Taiwan's economic growth in the past relied on the manufacturing
industry and that while it still needs the manufacturing industry, its service
industry is gradually on the rise.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the government should attach greater importance to the service
industry, "especially because most of the research and development funding is
now used for the manufacturing industry, but in fact, should be focused more
heavily on innovation and R&amp;D in the service industry."</P>
      <P>Wells earlier gave a speech on strengthening Taiwan's competitiveness in face of
global challenges.</P>

      <P>A Vatican official expressed confidence Monday in Rome that Taiwan will become
"a beacon of light for the world" with its strong democratic traditions,
spiritual civilization and tenacity, according to a statement released by the
Republic of China Embassy to the Holy See.</P>
      <P>Monsignor Gianfranco Ravasi, president of the Pontifical Council for Culture,
made the remarks in a written address to a conference on the Catholic history of
Taiwan. The speech was read by Ravasi's deputy, Monsignor Sanchez Del Toca, who
attended the event on his behalf.</P>
      <P>The conference was held by the Republic of China Embassy to the Holy See and the
Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, or the Angelicum. It drew the
participation of more than 150 scholars, Vatican officials, diplomats,  priests
and professors from the university.</P>
      <P>In his opening remarks, ROC Ambassador to the Holy See Wang Yu-yuan noted that a
free and democratic system is the cornerstone of religious freedom.</P>
      <P>The fact that the Catholic church and 25 other religions are thriving in Taiwan
is testament to the country's progress in democratic development, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Although the number of Catholic followers accounts for less than 2 percent of
Taiwan's population, the Catholic concepts of fairness and justice are deep-
rooted in Taiwan through educational, medical and humanitarian programs promoted
by the Catholic church, Wang went on.</P>
      <P>He said humanitarianism, justice, charity, poverty reduction and the
preservation of world peace are values commonly shared by Taiwan and the Holy

      <P>The wife of the 2009 Nobel laureate in physics, Charles K. Kao, who suffers from
Alzheimer's disease, said Tuesday that her husband wanted to return to a quiet
and undisturbed life and asked the media to respect his wishes.</P>
      <P>In an open letter delivered through the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK),
of which Kao once served as president, Kao's wife said that since the
announcement Oct. 6 that Kao had been awarded the Nobel prize, they had received
messages from friends from all over the world.</P>
      <P>"We are overwhelmed by the sea of congratulatory messages from so many people,"
the letter said.</P>
      <P>"A Nobel laureate of Chinese ethnicity is a rare event and we understand the
outpouring of happiness and pride for our people throughout the world wherever
they live," the letter said.</P>
      <P>"We would like to thank all who have expressed concern about his (Kao's) health.
Unfortunately there is no cure at present for Alzheimer's. Charles shares this
problem of coping with Alzheimer's with other eminent persons, Ronald Reagan and
Margaret Thatcher to name but two," it continued.</P>
      <P>"He (Kao) is eminently proud of his past achievements and excited at becoming a
Nobel laureate -- an unexpected award. The press and media have interviewed him
and he is happy they have found all the facts they need. So he is more than
ready to return to a quiet and undisturbed life now, and he asks that the media
respect this, " the letter said.</P>
      <P>Kao, 75, was named one of three winners of the 2009 Nobel Prize for Physics for

habit of buying snacks after school on their way home, and their favorite
choices are fried chicken and shake drinks, the results of a survey released
Tuesday showed.</P>
      <P>This means that one in every two students aged 11-15 in the greater Taipei area
is at risk for gastrointestinal problems because of the unhealthy foods they
consume at the end of the school day, according to the survey conducted by a
Taipei medical university hospital, Shuang Ho.</P>
      <P>Some 40 percent of parents would not start paying attention to their children's
diets until the students develop gastrointestinal problems, the poll found.</P>
      <P>Yeh Tzu-chen, a family medicine doctor at Shuang Ho Hospital, said more than 60
percent of the snacks that Taiwanese students favor, such as fried chicken,
French fries and pearl milk tea, are high calorie foods and tend to cause acute
gastroenteritis in children. In addition, Yeh said, the pearl milk tea and
similar drinks sold by street vendors are usually unsanitary.</P>
      <P>Many local students suffer from gastrointestinal diseases because their diets

authorities on how to handle the boat and is crew.</P>
      <P>After meeting the vessel Oct. 9 when it was some 1,000 km east of Ouluanpi, the
southernmost tip of Taiwan, four armed CGA officers boarded the vessel, freeing
Shih and Tsai and subduing the suspected Indonesian crewmen.</P>
      <P>The two suspects  were later transferred  to the relevant authorities for
further investigation.</P>
      <P>"We were lucky enough to be able to come home unharmed, unlike the cases in many
other sea mutinies, although we did suffer a loss of NT$1 million as we caught
no fish, " Shih said after meeting his wife and son.</P>

      <P>Taiwan should develop and nurture its tourism industry, the head of a
prestigious business school located in Lausanne, Switzerland said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>John R. Wells, president of the International Institute for Management
Development (IMD), made the remarks in a seminar in Taipei presided over by San
Gee, deputy chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
      <P>Wells urged Taiwan to think about nurturing its service industry. Noting that
the government does have plans to upgrade its service industry, such as the
development of the tourism, medical and education sectors, he also said it
should take stock of developments in other countries, adding that if Taiwan
wants to develop its tourism, it could learn from the experience of Spain.</P>
      <P>He also said that if the people of China, with its population of 1.3 billion,
want to visit Taiwan, tourism revenues will be immense.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Institute of Economic Research President David Hong said on the same
occasion that Taiwan's economic growth in the past relied on the manufacturing
industry and that while it still needs the manufacturing industry, its service
industry is gradually on the rise.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the government should attach greater importance to the service
industry, "especially because most of the research and development funding is

the Ox according to the lunar calendar. Following is a list of important events

1915: The Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of China government orders a
halt to the practice of binding the feet of women.

1920: Oxford University, the oldest university in Britain and one of the world's
most famous institutions of higher learning, grants degrees to women for the

known as "Desert Fox," dies at the age of 53.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "The moral man knows that the accomplishment of
great things consists in doing little things well. He knows that great effects
are produced by small causes. He knows the evidence and reality of what cannot
be perceived by the senses. Thus he is enabled to enter into the world of ideas
and morals."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>As military villages fade, residents try to keep memories alive</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>CNA staff writer</P>
      <P>Businessman Wang Rong-sheng recently returned to Taiwan during a break from
running his company in China's Shandong province and accompanied his 85-year-old
mother to Tainan City in southern Taiwan to visit the neighborhood they had
called home since 1950.</P>
      <P>What he came home to was a wrenching site, even if he knew what to expect. The
61-year-old Wang's old village of Shuei-jiao-she, a 45-hectare residential
compound for Republic of China Air Force personnel and their dependents since
1948, had been razed.</P>
      <P>Like many of its residents, Wang's father, an Air Force officer, and his family
settled there after fleeing China following the communist victory in the Chinese
civil war.</P>
      <P>Memories of his family's Japanese-style home, the air raid shelter where he
played hide-and-seek with his friends, and the stand where his mother would buy
steamed buns for breakfast from a veteran from Henan province all welled up as
Wang was overcome with emotion.</P>
      <P>Wang's wife of 35 years could appreciate how her husband and his mother felt
after seeing their home of nearly five decades turned into piles of debris as
she also grew up in a village for military dependents, known in Taiwan as "juan
cun, " that no longer exists.</P>
      <P>Nostalgia is all many former residents of these "juan cun" have left as the
villages fade into oblivion with the old soldiers passing away and the single
story dwellings, many left over from the Japanese colonial era, being torn down
to make way for urban development projects.</P>
      <P>Roughly 600,000 armed forces personnel and their dependents from China settled
in the juan cun -- mostly quickly erected shanty villages -- and the compounds
were like miniature versions of China, with people from different Chinese
provinces living next door to each other.</P>
      <P>By 1982, fewer than 100,000 units in some 300 full-scale compounds were left
nationwide. All that remains today are some 1,300 housing units on military
village sites scattered around Taiwan, their obstinate residents holding out
against having their houses torn down.</P>
      <P>Even the Wangs moved out of Shuei-jiao-she in the late 1990s, in pursuit of
modern comforts and new opportunities, but, as with many former juan cun
residents, their village still exists vividly in their memories, and some former
residents are pushing to preserve their culture in more than just their minds.</P>
      <P>Yu Lih-hua, a professor at National University of Tainan who was raised in
Shuei-jiao-she, and a group of Shuei-jiao-she activists have scrambled to save
parts of the village since Tainan City began dismantling the compound in 2007.</P>
      <P>"We Shuei-jiao-she people have lagged behind our counterparts in other juan cun
around the country in the area of conservation, " Yu said.</P>
      <P>As Shuei-jiao-she grew obsolete during this decade, the Tainan City government
quickly moved to reclaim the 45-hectare site and earmarked some NT$200 million
to clean up the village, build new roads and manage the land in a bid to turn it
into an upscale residential area with a shopping mall.</P>
      <P>But through the persuasive efforts of Yu and other activists to keep Shuei-jiao-
she's memory alive, the city government left standing eight Japanese style
residences, the village's elementary school and anumber of old trees, and these
are being converted into a military village cultural park.</P>
      <P>The old residences will become museums and an ecological park will highlight the
site's century-old elm trees, decades-old mahogany trees and giant coconut
trees.</P>
      <P>A total of 23 juan cun have been preserved in similar ways around the country,
and Yu says Shuei-jiao-she could be selected by the Ministry of Defense as one
of up to 10 locations that will be developed into juan cun cultural preservation
areas aimed at conserving the unique culture of these villages.</P>
      <P>The Military Dependents' Service Department under the MND's General Political
Warfare Bureau has asked local governments to submit their plans by next March
to participate in the NT$400 million project.</P>
      <P>"It is hoped that the juan cun culture conservation project will eventually
create new tourism and cultural assets for the country, " said Lin Ching-fu,
head of the MND department.</P>
      <P>They are not the only ones trying to preserve juan cun tradition.</P>
      <P>When Wang and his mother were touring their old village, which they moved out of
in the late 1990s to pursue opportunities elsewhere, they were guided by Chu
Rong-mei, who was also raised in Shuei-jiao-she and now teaches Japanese at
National Cheng Kung University in Tainan.</P>
      <P>She wrote a book called "Shuei-Jiao-She -- a Juan Cun in Memory" that was
published in December 2008, and she said she forced herself to complete the
project in two months, before an Asahi Shimbun crew visited Shuei-jiao-she to
cover its history and current predicament as part of an in-depth report on
Taiwan's juan cun and their culture.</P>
      <P>"We could not let the Japanese outperform us in the effort to conserve our own
unique but fading juan cun culture," Chu said.</P>
      <P>During the Wangs' tour of the village, Chu took them to an open field where
several individual Japanese residences were located before they were leveled in
2007.</P>
      <P>The land that once was home to houses built by the Japanese military for its
naval officers and their dependents before Japan's surrender in 1945 has
ironically given way to even older historical relics.</P>
      <P>It is now an archeological site after scores of ancient tombs were discovered
there, some dating back to the Ming Dynasty (1368V 1644) and the Qing Dynasty
(1644-1912).</P>
      <P>The tombs, comprised of gravestones and wooden coffins with thick earthen and
gravel shells, were unearthed after workers cleaned away the leveled buildings
in April to make way for a new road.</P>
      <P>Turning to another area of the now empty village, Chu identified a place where
the homes of the first-generation pilots of the famous "Thunder Tiger" jet
fighter squad were located.</P>
      <P>The "Thunder Tiger" squad was a source of pride for Taiwan during the 1950s and
1960s. Some of the squad members were national heroes for downing China's MiG-15
and MiG-17 fighters during missions across the Taiwan Strait before the '60s.</P>
      <P>The squad's exceptional flying skills were also shown off at National Day
parades and overseas shows between 1952 and 1989.</P>
      <P>This "Thunder Tiger" phenomenon was one of the "collective memories" of Shui-
jiao-she and just one of the elements that made the village so unique, Yu says.</P>
      <P>In the same vein as the village's celebration of the "Thunder Tiger" squad, the
name of Tainan Air Force Elementary School, attended by almost all children
raised in Shuei-jiao-she before the 1970s, was changed to Tainan Municipal
Chihkai Elementary School in 1967 in memory of air force hero Chou Chih-kai.</P>
      <P>Chou was conferred medals by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek during the early
1940s for downing six Japanese fighters. He was later killed in an air battle in
Hubei province in 1943.</P>
      <P>His mother, honored as "the Mother of the Air Force, " moved to Taiwan in 1949
and settled in Shuei-jiao-she, where she lived until passing away in the 1980s.
She was once elected as a member of the Tainan City Council, with her supporters
being mostly air force personnel and their dependents.</P>
      <P>Those who grew up in Shuei-jiao-she all remember an open stadium village where
many renowned movie stars from Taiwan and Hong Kong, even America, visited to
meet their local fans and cheer up the military troops.</P>
      <P>But perhaps as enduring as any memory are the basic tastes and smells derived
from the variety of food representing all corners of China that appeared in the
village.</P>
      <P>Many dishes mixed the traditions of various Chinese provinces with culinary
innovations born of necessity in a time of scarcity -- cooked dog meat sold by a
veteran from Guangdong, cold noodles peddled by a veteran from Sichuan, and
cured pork sold by veterans from Hunan.</P>
      <P>Through the efforts of Yu, Chu, and many other activists and local governments,
those memories will now be allowed to survive, enabling families like the Wangs
to relive their old culture as the military villages fade away.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Second wave of H1N1 outbreak emerging in Taiwan: CDC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) warned Wednesday that a second wave of the
influenza A (H1N1) outbreak is emerging in Taiwan after the previous one peaked
in early September.</P>
      <P>According to CDC Director-General Steve Kuo, the H1N1 situation has been
moderating over the past five weeks since the previous peak but a slight jump in
the number of patients diagnosed with the new flu strain recently signals the
beginning of the second wave.</P>
      <P>Statistics released Wednesday by the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) show
that there was one more patient hospitalized with the H1N1 flu strain than a day
earlier, bringing to 355 the total number of such cases since the outbreak
began.</P>
      <P>While 16 of the patients remained in the hospital, 315 had recovered and been
discharged, and 24 others had died, the CECC said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 442 classes in 294 schools around the country remained suspended
because of H1N1 infections among students. The number of affected classes
accounted for 0.29 percent of the total, according to the CECC.</P>
      <P>Although epidemiologists have predicted that the second peak would appear in
November, Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang said it is hard
to predict when the peak will be and that the DOH will continue to monitor the
situation closely.</P>
      <P>To help the public prepare for the epidemic, the DOH will distribute 5 million
masks in inventory to 100,000 low-income families beginning Nov. 1, Yaung said.</P>
      <P>Also, the CECC is expected to make public details regarding its H1N1 vaccination
program on Oct. 20, when the results of human clinical trials for the H1N1
vaccine produced by local vaccine manufacturer Adimmune Corp. are expected to be
released, DOH Deputy Minister Chang Shen-chwen said.</P>
      <P>While people under 10 years of age will probably have to receive two shots,
those aged 10 years and older will likely need only one to be protected against
the disease, Chang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New envoy to Indonesia still under consideration: foreign minister</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Timothy C.T. Yang said Wednesday that the appointment of the
new representative to Indonesia is being finalized, but he refused to confirm
that former Vice Foreign Minister Andrew Hsia will be the one to take over the
post.</P>
      <P>"The appointment of the new envoy to Indonesia is in the final stages of the
process but has yet to be finalized, " the foreign minister said during a budget
review hearing in the Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs and National Defense
Committee.</P>
      <P>He said many candidates were being considered and that an announcement would be
made when the time is ripe.</P>
      <P>Local daily the Liberty Times reported Wednesday that Hsia, who stepped down to
take political responsibility for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' (MOFA's)
response to Typhoon Morakot, has been tapped to be the new envoy to Indonesia.</P>
      <P>The appointment  is in line  with President  Ma Ying-jeou administration's
policy to focus on expanding contacts and exchanges with countries of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, in which Indonesia is a major player,
the report said.</P>
      <P>It added that Yang's ascension as foreign minister after serving as Taiwan's
representative to Indonesia only added importance to the position.</P>
      <P>Hsia tendered his resignation to take responsibility for the Foreign Ministry's
instructions Aug. 11 to ask all its foreign offices to politely decline any
offers of help from their host governments in the wake of Typhoon Morakot, which
swept though Taiwan Aug. 7-10, killing over 600 people.</P>
      <P>He and former Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou later stepped down along with
former Premier Liu Chao-shiuan and the rest of his Cabinet, which resigned en
masse last month, to assume political responsibility for what was called a slow
and inadequate government response to the typhoon disaster.</P>
      <P>Asked whether it would be "compensation" for Hsia if he were appointed as the
envoy to Indonesia, Yang simply replied, "there is no such issue as
compensation."</P>
      <P>"Given Hsia's profound diplomatic experience and his excellent performance that
is well recognized by our colleagues in the Foreign Ministry, he has plenty of
opportunities to continue contributing to the development of foreign relations,"
Yang added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan completes signature drive for bids to join U.N. agencies</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
10/14/09  13:39:37
(By Hwang Jaw-pyng, Y.F. Low, and Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has concluded a signature drive for its bids to participate in two United
Nations specialized agencies, but not all of the country's allies endorsed it,
Taiwanese officials posted in the United States said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>While 16 of Taiwan's diplomatic allies signed a position paper in support of its
inclusion in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
, 15 signed another paper petition on Taiwan's  participation  in the
International  Civil  Aviation Organization (ICAO) , according to officials at
the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) in New York.</P>
      <P>The two documents are expected to be delivered respectively to the U.N. missions
of UNFCCC signatories and ICAO member nations by Thursday, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The allies that endorsed the UNFCCC bid are the Solomon Islands, Palau, St.
Vincent and the Grenadines, the Marshall Islands, Belize, St. Lucia, the Gambia,
Sao Tome and Principe, Nicaragua, Tuvalu, Nauru, Swaziland, El Salvador, Burkina
Faso, Kiribati, and St. Christopher and Nevis.</P>
      <P>These same allies also endorsed the ICAO bid except for Tuvalu, which is not an
ICAO member.</P>
      <P>The seven allies that did not sign either of the documents are Paraguay, Panama,
Guatemala, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Honduras and the Holy See.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Henry Chen downplayed the lack of support
from some of Taiwan's allies, saying that Taiwan only "welcomed" rather than
pushed allies to endorse the petition.</P>
      <P>The lack of outward support from certain allies does not mean, however, they
would not support or speak on Taiwan's behalf at the meetings of the specialized
agencies when the country's bid for participation is being considered, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>As the UNFCCC secretariat is located in Bonn, Germany, and the ICAO headquarters
is in Montreal, Canada, Taiwan will also have its representative  offices in
these two countries  help push the respective bids, TECO officials said.</P>
      <P>They said promoting the UNFCCC bid ahead of the United Nations Climate Change
Conference slated for Dec. 7-18 in Copenhagen will highlight  the urgency and
importance  of Taiwan's  meaningful participation in the convention.</P>
      <P>Since 1993, Taiwan has been trying -- unsuccessfully, due to Beijing's
objections -- to have the United Nations consider the issue of its
representation. In 2008, the country shifted its strategy to promoting a bid to
"participate meaningfully in the activities of specialized U.N. agencies, " in
line with President Ma Ying-jeou's diplomatic strategy that favors a moderate
and pragmatic approach.</P>
      <P>Following Taiwan's success in its bid to attend the World Health Assembly -- the
World Health Organization's decision-making arm -- as an observer for the first
time in May this year, the government has recently announced that the UNFCCC and
the ICAO will be the country's next targets for such "meaningful participation."</P>

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials
Wednesday:</P>
      <P>CHINA TIMES:</P>
      <P>Grand justices should decide early on former president's request for
constitutional interpretation</P>
      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian has requested a constitutional interpretation on
the changing of the head of the panel of judges during his trial on corruption
charges, with Chou Chan-chun giving way to Tsai Shou-hsun.</P>
      <P>Such a request was unprecedented, and the direct reason behind the request is
that Chen thinks there were irregularities in the changing of the panel's chief
judge. Chou decided twice that Chen should not be detained, while Tsai has
consistently maintained that Chen should be detained. Because the interpretation
by the grand justices could affect the legitimacy of the court's decision in the
trial, how they handle the request will become the focus of attention.</P>
      <P>The deliberation process of the constitutional interpretation cases is usually
not in the open, in contrast with the transparency of regular court cases, but
due to the high-profile nature of the case, the grand justices should think
deeply about the request and make a speedy decision.</P>
      <P>LIBERTY TIMES:</P>
      <P>Ma administration's next step will be to list Falun Gong as</P>
      <P>evil cult</P>
      <P>National Security Bureau Director-General Tsai Teh-sheng recently said that
Falun Gong is not an evil cult, and its founder Li Hongzhi is not a terrorist,
but it is not appropriate for him to visit Taiwan at this stage.</P>
      <P>Li as well as Uighur rights activist Rebiya Kadeer are not allowed to come to
Taiwan because of political sensitivity, with their visits potentially
sabotaging warmer cross-strait relations, according to Tsai.</P>
      <P>The so-called political sensitivities is in fact toeing the China line for fear
of offending Beijing.</P>
      <P>It is well known that China is the only country that stigmatizes the Falun Gong,
smearing it as an evil cult.</P>
      <P>China arrests and tortures Falun Gong practitioners. But Taiwan upholds
religious freedom, and the Falun Gong is protected under the constitution of the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Today, the Ma administration kowtows to China and bans Li's entry. The public
should not be too surprised when the administration obeys Beijing and declares
the Falun Gong an evil cult.</P>
      <P>l</P>
      <P>UNITED DAILY NEWS: From Obama to Wei Jingsheng</P>
      <P>U.S. president Barack Obama is the surprise winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, and
the long-held expectations of such Chinese human right activists Wei Jingsheng
and Hu Jia to win the prize fell through.</P>
      <P>If the prize was to be awarded to the activists, Wei is certainly more qualified
than Hu, who came out 30 years later and who received a higher education.</P>
      <P>In comparison, at Wei's time, Mao Zedong had just died and China was a closed-
door  society after tumultuous  10-year  Cultural Revolution. Wei's appeal for
democracy was the most impressive cry from the grassroots level in the "Beijing
Spring" movement.</P>
      <P>Wei said in an article  called  "the Fifth Modernization: Democracy" that was
posted on Beijing's Democracy Wall in 1978 that Deng Xiaoping, who crushed the
'Gang of Five,' (including Mao Zedong) should "give thanks to the outcries that
catapulted him to power."</P>
      <P>The calls were actually the voice of the people, and in Wei's view, the "Gang of
Five" was not only defeated in 1976 through an internal struggle won by Deng and
Ye Jianying but also because of that public voice.</P>
      <P>Although Wei was then a 28-year-old electrician in a Beijing zoo and a senior
high school graduate, his philosophy had tinges of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and
John Locke,  and he foresaw China's direction over the next 30 years,</P>
      <P>Wei's political views may have been shared by many at China's grassroots level,
but they would not or did not dare express them explicitly as Wei.</P>
      <P>Though Beijing's leaders, such as Hu Jintao, cannot identify outwardly with
Wei's,  they should allow the people's "voice" to constantly reverberate in
their minds.</P>
      <P>APPLE DAILY: Ma administration has not delivered on promises</P>
      <P>Three months after opening Taiwan to Chinese investment, only NT$189 million has
entered Taiwan. The number of Chinese tourists arriving in Taiwan has also
fallen far short of expectations since its opening last year.</P>
      <P>But now the Ma administration is going to sign an MOU on financial supervisory
cooperation  and an economic cooperation framework agreement with China. That
has caused great concern among workers, who fear that unemployment will rise
even as businesses welcome the measures.</P>
      <P>After the signing of the MOU, Chinese banks could set up branches in Taiwan, but
China has no private banks, and they will serve political purposes after they
come to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If the Chinese branches offer higher interest rates than local banks and draw a
high volume of deposits, then lend the money to Chinese-invested enterprises in
Taiwan that then buy important assets in Taiwan, how will the government grapple
with such a scenario?</P>
      <P>The misgivings about the ECFA run deeper. The Ma administration is thinking
about mitigating the impact of Taiwan being marginalized after the ASEAN plus
one (China) goes into effect next year.</P>
      <P>But has China made any promises? If more local businesses flow out of Taiwan and
go to China after the implementation of ASEAN plus one, and China's
agricultural, service and manufacturing products flow into Taiwan, the products
made with cheap labor could threaten the very survival of similar industries in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Ma administration vows not to let in Chinese agricultural products and
laborers, but this will run counter to the spirit of the WTO and the ECFA. The
administration needs to assuage the public's misgivings about these questions.</P>

      <P>A fourth round of talks between the chief cross-Taiwan Strait negotiators of
Taiwan and China will be held in December in the central city of Taichung, the
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and
China-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS)
President Chen Yunlin last met in Nanjing in April, when they signed three
agreements  on the launch  of regular cross-strait passenger flights,  mutual
judicial assistance and financial cooperation, as well as releasing a joint
statement on a proposal to open Taiwan to Chinese investment.</P>
      <P>The date and venue for the next Chiang-Chen talks were decided upon in a meeting
held in Hangzhou a day earlier between SEF Vice Chairman Kao Koong-lian and his
ARATS counterpart Zheng Lizhong, according to MAC Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun.</P>
      <P>In their upcoming meeting, the two officials are expected to sign four
agreements regarding fishing labor cooperation, agricultural quarantine
inspection, standards, inspection and certification for industrial products, and
the avoidance of double taxation, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Related officials from the two sides will meet soon to thresh out the details to
be covered by the agreements, Liu added.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are semi-official intermediary bodies set up by Taiwan and

Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) to examine if the acquisition of Nan Shan
Life Insurance Co. by a consortium led by a Hong Kong financial services firm
was financed with capital from China.</P>
      <P>The financial regulatory body should check if the ultimate beneficiary of the
Nan Shan deal has any connection with China, according to DPP spokesman Chao
Tien-lin.</P>
      <P>"Regardless of whether it's financed by foreign capital or Hong Kong capital,
the most important point is that there should be 'zero Chinese capital,'" Chao
said at a press conference.</P>
      <P>He stressed that if the government did not track down the ultimate beneficiaries
in the deal, the "zero Chinese capital" principle might be nominally achieved,
but Chinese investors could still be involved.</P>
      <P>The transaction  will be examined first by the Investment Commission of the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) and then sent to the FSC for final approval.</P>
      <P>Economics Minister Shih Yen-shiang would not comment on the issue Wednesday
because the deal has yet to be sent to the Investment Commission.</P>
      <P>An Investment Commission official added that the agency will carefully examine
the deal after related documents are received.</P>
      <P>US insurer American International Group Inc. (AIG) announced Tuesday that it had
agreed to sell its 97.57 percent stake in its Taiwanese unit, Nan Shan Life, to
a consortium comprising Hong Kong-based financial services firm Primus Financial
Holdings and Hong Kong-listed investment firm China Strategic Holdings Limited
for US$2.15 billion (NT$69.3 billion).</P>
      <P>Robert Morse, chairman and co-CEO of Primus, denied at a press conference
Tuesday that Chinese capital was involved in financing the acquisition, saying
the funds came from institutional investors and wealthy families around the
globe.</P>
      <P>FSC Vice Chairwoman Lee Jih-chu said Tuesday that Primus has guaranteed that the
Nan Shan deal was not funded by Chinese capital, but added that she has asked
the company to provide documentation to prove the absence of Chinese interests
in the deal.</P>
      <P>According to local laws, companies with Chinese funding are not allowed to
invest in Taiwan's financial institutions, including insurance companies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Peaceful transitions show democracy can work in Asia: legislator</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 14 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>A ruling Kuomintang (KMT) legislator and member of the Taiwan Foundation for
Democracy's (TFD) board of directors, said at an international symposium
Wednesday in Taipei that the two peaceful transitions of power in Taiwan prove
that democracy works in Asia.</P>
      <P>"The transitions of power in Taiwan -- it speaks for itself loud and clear our
conviction that democracy can work in Asia, " John Chiang said at the Symposium
on Democracy Building in Asia, which is being jointly held by U.S. think tank
the Heritage Foundation, the nongovernmental TFD, and the Institute for National
Policy Research (INPR).</P>
      <P>Chiang was referring to the changes of government in Taiwan in both 2000 and
2008.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's 2000 presidential election realized an unprecedented transition of
power in the Republic of China's 90-year history, when the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) ousted the long-ruling KMT.</P>
      <P>In 2008 the KMT returned to power following landslide wins in both the Jan. 12
legislative elections and the March 22 presidential election, marking the second
time Taiwan's electorate had put the opposition party in power in the country's
history.</P>
      <P>Edwin Feulner, president of the Heritage Foundation, echoed Chiang's views
Wednesday, saying that while he was well aware of Taiwan's blemishes, he also
knew how far Taiwan has come in terms of self governance, as the country has
moved from authoritarianism to fighting communism, to a vigorous participatory
democracy.</P>
      <P>"The peaceful transfer of power has validated Taiwan's democratic experiment in
the eyes of the world," Feulner said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is better for having proved a democratic proposition through this
repeated,  peaceful transition of power from one political party to another," he
added.</P>
      <P>Speaking of building democracy in Asia, Chiang said it is an enormous and very
difficult task to have democracy take root in Asia in a short period of time,
given the continent's complexity, with its range of political and economic
systems and great variety of cultural, linguistic and religious traditions and
practices.</P>
      <P>Describing the discussion of the development of democracy in Asia that is taking
place in Taiwan as very appropriate, Feulner said that as unsettling as changes
of government can be, they themselves have testified to the value of freedom.</P>
      <P>"Whatever our peers in non-democracies may tell us, their own people want for
the power to be free to choose, that is to change their governments," he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Kong's chief executive announced Wednesday a series of measures to enhance
the territory's relations with Taiwan, including a plan to set up an office
there at an appropriate time.</P>
      <P>Chief Executive Donald Tsang revealed the plan during his annual policy address
to the Legislative Council Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tsang singled out Hong Kong's relations with Taiwan as one of the major topics
in his address, which dealt mainly with economic issues.</P>
      <P>"In response to the latest development in cross-Taiwan Strait relations, we will
actively pursue economic, cultural, social and other exchanges with Taiwan in
accordance with the Basic Law and Qian Qichen's Seven Principles," he said.</P>
      <P>According to Tsang, the government will adopt the following strategies to
develop its relations with Taiwan:</P>
      <P>-- It will initiate bilateral business cooperation committees and establish a
Hong Kong-Taiwan Economic and Cultural Cooperation and Promotion Council to
promote multi-faceted, multi-level exchanges with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong will consider setting up a multi-functional office in Taiwan at an
appropriate time and in an appropriate format to enhance high-level exchanges
between the two sides.</P>
      <P>--Hong Kong will foster economic cooperation with Taiwan, focusing particularly
on trade services, and will commence discussions with Taiwan on arrangements for
avoidance of double taxation, with a view to achieving progress and results.</P>
      <P>--Hong Kong will play an active role in providing cross-strait yuan currency
clearing services.</P>
      <P>The government will seek to enable Hong Kong travel agents to operate in
mainland China to sell tours to Taiwan, and will explore the further development
of multi-destination tourism products -- including air and cruise packages --
among Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Tsang  did not  elaborate  on the  plan  to set  up the multi-functional office
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Currently, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, which is financially
supported by the government, has an office in Taipei but it deals only with
trade matters and does not represent the Hong Kong government.</P>

      <P>A seminar was held on the outlying island of Kinmen Wednesday to mark the 60th
anniversary of the battle of Guningtou, in which Kuomintang (KMT) forces fought
off attacking Chinese communists to maintain control of the island.</P>
      <P>Forty-one veterans of the battle were invited to attend the event, where they
were paid tribute for their devotion to protecting the country.</P>
      <P>The seminar  was organized  by the Kinmen  National  Park Administration and the
Kinmen County Veterans Service Office.</P>
      <P>Tseng Wei-hung, head of the park administration, noted that the battle of
Guningtou was a crucial fight that helped Taiwan ward off the danger of being
seized by the Chinese communists.</P>
      <P>By analyzing and assessing the successes and failures of the battle, the seminar
was aimed at providing lessons for people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and
highlighting the value of peace, said Tseng.</P>
      <P>The battle of Guningtou took place Oct. 25-27, 1949, when nearly 10,000
communist troops in 200 ships invaded the Taiwanese frontline stronghold of
Kinmen, which lies just off the coast of China, as a prelude to seizing Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the ensuing fierce three-day battle, the invaders were utterly routed, losing
nearly 4,000 soldiers, with another 5,200 captured.</P>
      <P>The defeat brought a 10-year halt to Beijing's attempts to take Taiwan by force.
In 1958,  the communists began a protracted bombardment of Kinmen, but again
failed to seize any part of the island.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan expected to relax ban on U.S. beef with precautions</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is expected to re-open its doors soon to imports of U.S. bone-in beef,
shredded beef, some beef offal and other beef products, after Vice Premier Eric
Liluan Chu made a public promise Wednesday that consumers' health will be
safeguarded.</P>
      <P>"No matter whether it is in my capacity as vice premier, or as chairman of the
Consumer Protection Commission, I will not sacrifice consumers' rights and
benefits," Chu said.</P>
      <P>Chu made the promise while answering questions from Legislator Hou Tsai-feng of
the ruling Kuomintang at the Legislative Yuan, who expressed  concern  after
President  Ma  Ying-jeou  said  his administration had come close to a consensus
with the United States on the beef issue.</P>
      <P>It means the country is coming close to relaxing restrictions against imports of
the controversial beef products from the U.S., which reported its first case of
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) -- also called mad cow disease -- in
2003, prompting its major Asian trade partners, including Japan, South Korea and
Taiwan, to reject all its beef products.</P>
      <P>Taiwan partially lifted the ban in April 2005 to allow imports of de-boned beef
from cattle under 30 months old, but it reimposed the ban two months later when
a second BSE case was discovered in the U.S.</P>
      <P>In 2006, Taiwan once again agreed to allow U.S. beef imports, but only boneless
beef from cattle under 30 months old, produced by certified slaughterhouses and
without any high-risk parts such as brains,  skulls,  eyes, spinal nerve roots,
tonsils and small intestines.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, the U.S. has never stopped trying to persuade Taiwan to open
its doors more widely to its beef products, without regard for the safety
concerns of local consumers.</P>
      <P>At the Legislative Yuan, the vice premier said that the scale of Taiwan's
relaxation of restrictions against U.S. beef imports will not be larger than
those of South Korea, which he said imposes the most strict safety standards on
U.S. beef among all the world's importers.</P>
      <P>Chu said, however, that "if the restrictions are too tight, they might harm the
bilateral economic and trade relations and the trust (between Taiwan and the
U.S.) "</P>
      <P>The government will demand that retailers sell U.S. beef in special sections to
allow consumers to decide whether to purchase it or not, he added.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, Ma told a visiting delegation of the Heritage Foundation, a
Washington, D.C.-based think tank, headed by Chairman Edwin J. Feulner, that
Taiwan and the U.S. have come close to a consensus on the beef issue.</P>
      <P>Ma expressed hope that the problem will be resolved in "the foreseeable future."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Minister of Health Yaung Chih-liang said imports will be restricted
to bone-in and boneless beef without high-risk parts and from cattle aged under
30 months.</P>
      <P>Asked when the restrictions will be relaxed, Yaung said "it should be near."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Civil servants should not play online game at work: CPA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Personnel Administration (CPA) said Wednesday that civil servants
are not allowed to play the Facebook application Happy Farm, a popular free
online game, during working hours.</P>
      <P>CPA Chief Secretary Chang Nien-chung said such behavior violates the Civil
Servants Law and the Civil Service Performance Evaluation Act, as civil servants
are not permitted to attend to non-civil service matters during work hours.</P>
      <P>Government organizations can decide upon methods of punishment, including oral
or written warnings, or even sending severe cases to be reviewed by the
Commission  on Disciplinary  Sanctions for Functionaries in accordance with the
law, Chang said while responding to questions from reporters.</P>
      <P>As the Happy Farm game has been gaining popularity among civil servants, Premier
Wu Den-yih also said civil servants should focus more on performing public
services, although he added that the government has not yet issued an order
banning such behavior.</P>
      <P>It would be unlikely to restrict such behavior if civil servants were to play in
their non-working hours, he went on.</P>
      <P>Some local governments have already taken measures to ban playing, with
Kaohsiung county officials saying the game has been blocked by their firewall.</P>
      <P>The Taipei city government has taken a more flexible approach by allowing the
Facebook connection during lunch breaks while banning access during working
hours, while the Taipei county government has blocked the game, a newspaper
reported that day.</P>
      <P>Happy Farm is currently the most popular online game in the nation, with some
3.3 million people playing it. There are some 16 million global users, according
to the game's developer.</P>
      <P>The game was designed by three Chinese men under the age of 30 in Shanghai in
2008 and sold to Facebook in April 2009. Players have to "raise crops and
livestock, and can take part in cattle rustling and garden raids."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Trade promoter sees more Chinese procurement from Taiwan next year</HEADLINE>

      <P>The total value of goods China will procure from Taiwan next year is expected to
exceed that of this year, although it will adopt a different procurement
approach, China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) Vice
President Zhang Wei said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Following a thaw in cross-Taiwan Strait relations since President Ma Ying-jeou
was inaugurated in May last year, the CCPIT has organized several procurement
missions to Taiwan with an aggregate procurement value of over US$10 billion.</P>
      <P>Zhang was in Taiwan as the head of a Chinese group that attended a cross-strait
seminar on the management of finance corporations that opened earlier that day
at the Taipei International Convention Center.</P>
      <P>He said that from next year, China's procurement from Taiwan will be
"normalized, " which means procurement will be made on a regular basis rather
than sending procurement groups that each spend at least NT$1 billion.</P>
      <P>"Moreover, the total value of China's procurements from Taiwan will increase
year-on-year," he added.</P>
      <P>Zhang, who concurrently serves as deputy head of several Chinese non- official
organizations, including the Affiliate of International Chamber of Commerce in
China, the Chinese Taxation Society, the China Finance Society and the China Law
Society, said that " Taiwan is attractive to Chinese investors."</P>
      <P>He made the remarks in response to comments on the limited size of Chinese
investment in Taiwan after the government began allowing investment in certain
areas from the other side of the strait in late June.</P>
      <P>According to official statistics, Chinese investments totaled a mere NT$189
million as of the end of September, far lower than the general public's
expectation.</P>
      <P>"These enterprises need a `trial and accommodation' process before they can
reach the decision on whether to invest in Taiwan, and we are here trying to
figure out the right directions for would-be investors," Zhang said.</P>
      <P>He said that with an excellent investment climate, Taiwan would be able to
attract more Chinese investment in the future.</P>
      <P>Zhang also said that China's economy is gaining momentum, with a predicted 8.5
percent growth this year, from which Taiwan and the rest of the world will
benefit as a result.</P>
      <P>He also noted that China's foreign trade is gradually recovering from the impact
of the international economic crisis, evidenced by the shrinking rate of
decrease in its trade volume.</P>
      <P>According to China's latest official statistics, the country registered a total
trade volume of US$1.557 trillion in the first nine moths of this year, down
20.9 percent from a year ago.</P>
      <P>Zhang predicted that China foreign trade will fall by 20 percent for 2009,
taking into account a possible global economic recovery.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Issue of THRSC's handover period has to be addressed: vice minister</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Sooner of later the government will have to deal with a request by the debt-
ridden Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) to extend the 35-year concession
period to allow the company to reduce its mounting deficit, the vice minister of
transportation said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Central News Agency, Vice Minister of Transportation
and Communications Yeh Kuang-shih said an extension of the time when the THRSC
is supposed to hand over the project to the government will help the company to
deal with its depreciation and amortization issues in the face of its huge
debts.</P>
      <P>The THSRC board of directors appointed Ou Chin-de as the company's chairman last
month -- a decision that was widely seen as a bid to help the corporation
recover from its snowballing losses.</P>
      <P>Since the system went into operation more than two years ago, the THSRC --
Taiwan's largest build-operate-transfer (BOT) project -- has incurred a deficit
of NT$70.3 billion (US$2.18 billion) , mainly due to some NT$60 billion in high
interest on its bank loans and depreciation and amortization costs that total
over NT$40 billion.</P>
      <P>The THSRC inked a contract with the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) in July 1998 to build the high-speed rail on the BOT
model, under which it agreed to operate the system for 35 years then hand it
over to the government. The agreement also gives the THRSC the right to
development of the railway stations for a period of 50 years.</P>
      <P>The THSRC is expected to hold an extraordinary shareholders' meeting in November
to elect new board directors and supervisors, which will pave the way for the
government to play a leading role in steering the future course of the company.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the government is trying to arrange a new deal between the bank
syndicate and the company to obtain lower interest rates so that the company
could better service its loans, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>According  to  Yeh,  the  Ministry  of Transportation  and Communications also
thinks that it is unreasonable that the contract sets the depreciation rate for
the THSRC equipment and facilities at 26.5 years, because the service life of
the company's rail equipment and  construction  is estimated  at 100 years  and
80 years, respectively.</P>
      <P>Chiang  Chin-shan,  a representative  from  the Continental Engineering
Corporation (CEC) who is on the board of directors, said that the contract would
have to be revised to allow for an extension of the handover period.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chiang said, unavoidable natural disasters should also be factored
in. During the construction of the high speed rail project, work was suspended
due to an earthquake on Sept. 21, 1999. He added that it makes sense to also
extend the THRSC depreciation and amortization period.</P>
      <P>The CEC is one of the THSRC's  five  original  principal shareholders.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Susan Chang, chairwoman of Bank of Taiwan, said Wednesday that the
five major shareholders have refused to increase their investments, despite a
legislative resolution asking them do so.</P>
      <P>"The matter has been handed over to the MOTC, " Chang said, in response to
Kuomintang Legislator Sun Ta-chien's questions about the banking syndicate loan
to the THSRC.</P>
      <P>The bank consortium arranging the syndicate loan is also asking the THSRC's five
founding stakeholders to provide a joint liability guarantee for the new loan
and to give a clear answer by the end of this month, banking sources said.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the five major shareholders have rejected the proposal.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Lafayette slush fund still frozen in Swiss bank: top prosecutor</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A slush fund from the scandal-plagued Lafayette frigate deal struck between
Taiwan and France in the early 1990s is still frozen in a Swiss bank account,
Taiwan's top prosecutor said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>State Public Prosecutor-General Chen Tsung-ming made the remarks while fielding
questions at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting after recent news reports said
a Swiss federal court revoked earlier this month a 1996 court ruling that
determined the French contractor paid kickbacks on the Lafayette deal in
violation of its contract with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the news report, the Swiss court's about-face ruling might
adversely affect Taiwan's chances of winning an international commercial
arbitration that is still under way in Paris.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has demanded the repayment of US$520 million in unlawful kickbacks from
Thales -- the French company that sold six Lafayette frigates for US$2.5 billion
to the country in 1991 under its previous name of Thomson-CSF.</P>
      <P>Under Article 18 of the contract, the French contractor was prohibited from
making any kind of commission payment.</P>
      <P>In the arbitration petition, Taiwan is also demanding payment of 17 years' worth
of interest on the money.</P>
      <P>Over the ensuing years, the French contractor has insisted that it did not pay
any commission to secure the deal, but the French government has refused to
unveil any information about the money trail, citing the need to protect its
defense security, which has made it difficult to resolve the case.</P>
      <P>Local media reports said the latest Swiss court ruling seems to back the French
claim and could eventually lead to Taiwan's loss in the arbitration process.</P>
      <P>Responding to lawmakers' concerns about the prospects for the case, Chen said
the Oct. 8 Swiss court ruling clearly states that all the Taiwan-related
Lafayette slush fund will remain frozen in a Swiss bank account at Taiwan's
request.</P>
      <P>Chen was referring to US$495 million in unlawful kickbacks on the Lafayette
deal paid to Andrew Wang,  the middleman  who was Thompson-CSF's agent in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Swiss court writ will remain in place until after a Taiwanese
court has made a final ruling on the Wang-related corruption case.</P>
      <P>According to the Taiwanese investigation, Thompson-CSF paid the US$495 million
to Wang and a further US$25 million to Alfred Sirven, a former vice chairman of
the French oil firm Elf-Aquitaine. Sirven is alleged to have played the role of
money launderer and allocator of the kickbacks.</P>
      <P>Wang fled Taiwan in late 1993 following the death of Navy Captain Yin Ching-feng
under suspicious circumstances. Yin is believed to have been poised to blow the
whistle on colleagues who had allegedly received kickbacks from the Lafayette
deal. Wang has been wanted by the Taiwanese authorities for Yin's murder since
September 2000.</P>

      <P>The Tourism Bureau said Wednesday that it will fully support the promotion of
Kaohsiung tourism in China, as the number of economic and trade groups from
China to the southern Taiwan city has dropped recently.</P>
      <P>Tourism Bureau Director Janice Seh-Jen Lai made the comment in response to a
request by the Kaohsiung City government for the bureau to assist in promoting
the city's tourism business in eastern China's Zhejiang province.</P>
      <P>The occupancy rate at hotels in Kaohsiung City in September was about 50
percent, which was 10 percent lower than in the same period last year, Lai said.</P>
      <P>Some 1,000 mainland Chinese tour groups visited Kaohsiung in September,  close
to the figure a year earlier, she said at legislative question-and-answer
session. However, many economic and trade groups have canceled their
reservations and the number of business visitors has dropped sharply, she added.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the financial crisis, the outbreak of influenza A (H1N1), and
Typhoon Morakot, the number of tourists from Japan and Korea has also dropped,
contributing to the low occupancy rate at Kaohsiung hotels, Lai said.</P>
      <P>According to the Tourism Bureau, during the first nine months of the year, the
monthly average number of tourists from Japan was down 8 percent, and from Korea
the drop was 39 percent.</P>
      <P>According to some Kaohsiung tourism business executives, the decrease in the
number of Chinese tourists to the city was caused by the city government's
decision to invite Tibet's spiritual leader the Dalai Lama to visit Taiwan to
pray for victims of Typhoon Morakot, and the city's screening of a documentary

      <P>China's Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council said Wednesday that the
engagement of some interest groups in Kaohsiung with Tibet and Xinjiang
separatist forces has jeopardized China's interests and turned off the Chinese
people.</P>
      <P>It is only natural for the Chinese people to show their displeasure, said the

    <HEADLINE>No consensus yet on how to use China's relief donations: SEF</HEADLINE>

      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait have not yet reached a consensus on how the
money donated by China for Typhoon Morakot relief should be used, a senior
cross-strait negotiator said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Kao Koong-lian, vice chairman and secretary-general of the quasi-official
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , made the remark after a visit to Hangzhou,
China the previous day to discuss the date and venue for a new round of cross-
strait talks on issues of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>Kao said he exchanged views with his Chinese counterpart, Zheng Lizhong,  vice
president of the Beijing-based  Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS) , on the issue of the use of China's typhoon relief donations to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"But there is no consensus yet on the issue," Kao said.</P>
      <P>According to Kao, China has remitted 150 million yuan (about NT$710.4 million)
to Taiwan for reconstruction projects in the wake of the devastation wrought by
Typhoon Morakot in southern Taiwan in August. The remaining amount that China
has pledged in disaster aid to Taiwan will be remitted later, he added.</P>
      <P>Kao said Zheng did not present a list of rehabilitation projects that China
hopes Taiwan will fund with the donations.</P>
      <P>But Zheng did mention that China looks forward to seeing its donations used to
finance reconstruction of the Sijhou bridge in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung
County, which will cost an estimated NT$500 million (US$15.53 million), Kao
said.</P>
      <P>China also expressed the hope that the names of its donors will be engraved on
all new structures built with the funds, to highlight the goodwill between the
people on both sides, he said.</P>
      <P>In this regard, China took its cue from Taiwan, which donated huge sums after
China's Sichuan Province was devastated by a deadly earthquake in May 2008, Kao
noted.</P>
      <P>At the time, Taiwan requested that the names of its donors be inscribed on the
reconstruction projects that were to be built with its donations.</P>
      <P>Kao said he had told Zheng that Taiwan's political situation is different from
China's and that an overall assessment by the relevant central government
agencies would be required to determine how the funds should be used.</P>
      <P>According to an agreement reached at Tuesday's Kao-Zheng meeting, the fourth
round of talks between SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and ARATS President Chen
Yunlin will take place in the central Taiwan city of Taichung in December.</P>
      <P>Chiang and Chen last met in Nanjing in April, when they signed three agreements
on the launch of regular cross-strait passenger flights and mutual judicial
assistance and financial cooperation. They also released a joint statement on a
proposal to open Taiwan to Chinese investment.</P>
      <P>In their upcoming meeting, the two officials are expected to sign four
agreements regarding fishing labor cooperation; agricultural quarantine
inspection; standards, inspection and certification for industrial products; and
the avoidance of double taxation, Kao said.</P>
      <P>Related officials from the two sides will meet soon to thresh out the details of
the proposed agreements, he added.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are semi-official intermediary bodies set up by Taiwan and
China, respectively, to deal with cross-strait affairs and negotiations in the
absence of official ties between the two sides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Health food or medicine, fate of Centrum to be decided by year end</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's consumers will soon get a clear answer on whether Centrum, a U.S. brand
of vitamins, is food or medicine, Vice Premier Eric Li-luan Chu said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The reason why the product needs to be properly categorized is because currently
it is considered a type of medication by the government, which allows retailers
to sell it for much higher prices than it is sold in the United States, where it
is considered a type of nutritional supplement.</P>
      <P>"I personally regard Centrum as a health food, but will ask the Cabinet-level
Department of Health (DOH) to make a review and come up with a decision by the
end of this year, " Chu said while responding to inquiries from lawmakers at a
hearing in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chu doubles as chairman of the Consumer Protection Commission under the
Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Department of Health has branded Centrum as a medicine for its high
level of vitamins, Chu noted.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang lawmakers, Lai Shyh-bao, Ho Tsai-feng and Lin Hung-chih,
questioned why Centrum, which is categorized as a health food in the United
States, is considered and sold as medicine in Taiwan's market.</P>
      <P>By categorizing the product as a type of medicine, retailers in Taiwan can
charge high prices.</P>
      <P>According to Ho, prices of Centrum sold in the Taiwanese market vary greatly,
ranging from NT$5.38 per tablet to NT$8.32 each.</P>
      <P>In April, the price of one bottle of Centrum was about three times that in the
United States, Lai said. Even now, it is double the U.S. price, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Centrum is extremely popular among Taiwanese people, with many traveling to the
United States to bring it back to Taiwan as a gift for their friends or
relatives.</P>
      <P>On Oct. 12, the Taiwan High Court upheld a verdict by the Taipei District Court
by acquitting a Taiwanese woman surnamed Hsieh of the crime of selling banned
drugs.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who runs a drug store, was selling Centrum in the domestic market. She
had asked her friends to bring back the vitamins from the United States.</P>
      <P>The High Court acquitted her on the grounds that the reasons cited by the DOH
for categorizing Centrum as a type of medication was inadequate.</P>
      <P>Taipei prosecutors appealed Hsieh's case to the Taiwan High Court after the
local court ruled Hsieh not guilty.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several experts from Taiwan said Wednesday in an international symposium that
constitutional and legislative reforms are needed to improve the island's young
democracy.</P>
      <P>The experts were speaking at the "Legislative Optimization and Tools of
Democracysymposium at the Symposium on Democracy Building in Asia, which is
jointly held by the Heritage Foundation, a U.S. research and educational think
tank, the non-government Taiwan Foundation for Democracy (TFD), and the
Institute for National Policy Research (INPR).</P>
      <P>According to Shaw Yu-ming,  chairman  of the Taiwan Foreign Ministrys
Coordination Council for North American Affairs, for years there have been
debates about whether the Republic of China has a presidential system or Cabinet
system, and after many constitutional reforms, Taiwan has ended up with a dual
executive system.</P>
      <P>This means that the country would have a presidential system if the presidents
political party is the majority party in the national legislature, while it can
become a Cabinet system if the presidents political party is the minority party
in the legislature, he added.</P>
      <P>Shaw said that because former President Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) did not abide by this dual executive system during his
term from 2000-2008, many problems occurred, such as the fact that even though
then opposition Kuomintang held the majority in the legislature, it was not able
to dominate the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Shaw contended that to resolve these constitutional problems, two
constitutional amendments are needed: First, in the presidential election, only
when a candidate has received a simple majority of votesVthat means over 50
percentV can he or she be elected. Therefore, sometimes a second round of
election is needed.</P>
      <P>Second, in order to hold the executive branch accountable to the national
legislature, the appointment of the premier has to be approved by the national
legislature, Shaw added.</P>
      <P>Joseph Wu, former Taiwan representative to the U.S. and a research fellow at
National Chengchi University,  said at the symposium that as a young democracy,
a more important issue for Taiwan should be democratic consolidation.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, while some political scientists argued that the most important
rules of a democracy are being accepted and followed in Taiwan, the island is
perhaps still struggling over how its democracy can be consolidated.</P>
      <P>This is because there are still on-going debates on issues such as Taiwan's
national identity, and whether Taiwan should have a presidential system or a
parliamentary system, he added.</P>
      <P>Former DPP legislator Hsiao Bi-khim said that the optimization of Taiwans
legislative process is a very important element in the consolidation of Taiwans
democracy.</P>
      <P>Further  strengthening  and optimizing  the role  of the legislative branch in
Taiwan does enhance the fundamental principle of checks and balances in a modern
democracy,according to Hsiao.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Hsiao contended that it is essential to revise the structure of the
legislature, to increase accountability and checks and balances, and to improve
the quality of legislation.</P>

      <P>After announcing a discovery that the size of sugar molecules on the
hemagglutinin (HA) protein on influenza viruses plays a decisive role in immune
responses, Academia Sincia President Chi-Huey Wong said Wednesday it is hoped
that human trials of the vaccine produced based on the findings can be completed
within five years, and it can be marketed within 10 years.</P>
      <P>Wong made the remarks while answering questions by lawmakers at the Legislative
Yuan after a briefing on the 2010 working plans and budget of Academia Sinica,
Taiwan's top academic research institute.</P>
      <P>During the session, many legislators expressed concern over Wong's disclosure
that the findings of his team's vaccine research will be transferred to a U.S.
company, founded by an alumnus of National Taiwan University, for development of
the vaccine.</P>
      <P>In response to their questions on why Taiwan cannot hold on to such a major
research breakthrough, Wong said the findings cannot be transferred to a company
that is incapable of developing the vaccine.</P>
      <P>"We have also to consider how much we can get" from the company that succeeds in
developing and producing a profitable product based on Academia Sinica's
findings, he said.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica owns the intellectual property rights for the "molecule vaccine,
" Wong noted, adding that the institute will be paid royalties and the amount
will vary at different stages of the vaccine's development.</P>
      <P>If sales of the vaccine reach US$1 billion, Academia Sinica could earn US$100
million, he added.</P>
      <P>Wong further explained that it requires at least NT$10 billion to develop a new
vaccine and he had determined that no Taiwanese company can afford that.</P>
      <P>For those reasons he picked an international company which has agreed to open a
branch in Taiwan to work on the development and manufacture of the vaccine, he
said.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, Wong expressed optimism over the development of effective vaccines
against seasonal flu and the new A(H1N1) virus based on his team's findings.</P>
      <P>The findings have been published in the latest online issue of U.S.-based
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</P>

      <P>Holland' s envoy to Taiwan, Menno Goedhart, said Wednesday that he may seek to
stay in Taiwan after his term expires next year.</P>
      <P>"I will seriously consider remaining in Taiwan following the expiration of my
current term, because I have my fellow 'tribesmen' here," Goedhart said at a
joint press conference with Tainan City Mayor Hsu Tien-tsai to promote Holland
Day activities.</P>
      <P>Since he was named the representative of the Netherlands Trade and Investment
Office in Taiwan seven years ago, Goedhart has toured almost every corner of
Taiwan, and has become an "elder" of the Rukai people, one of the 10-odd
aboriginal tribes of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Some citizens of Holland married local aborigines, mostly Rukais, during the
country's colonial rule of Taiwan between 1624 and 1661.</P>
      <P>Goedhart said he was the second foreigner to be awarded the honor of the "elder"
title by the Rukai group in Shantimen township in the southern Taiwan county of
Pingtung. The first foreign elder in the Rukai tribe was also a Hollander, in
the early 20th century.</P>
      <P>Goedhart said he would choose to live in Tainan City, which has granted him
honorary citizenship, once his wife agrees to stay in Taiwan instead of
returning to Europe.</P>
      <P>This year's Holland Day activities, the third consecutive event of its kind
organized by the Tainan City Government, will kick off Oct. 17.</P>
      <P>The event willl feature a bike tour of the area around the Chicano Tower on Oct.
17-18, and a "Shuwu" (tree-house) party and a rock-and-roll concert on Oct.
24-25, in which Holland's folk plays will be presented and traditional Dutch
delicacies will be served.</P>
      <P>The Chicano Tower, formerly called Fort of Provintia, was built in Tainan City
by the Dutch in 1653 during their colonization of the island.</P>

      <P>High-ranking executives of Taiwan's media outlets will visit China Oct. 28-Nov.
11 for discussions on ways and means of enhancing cross-strait media
cooperation, Vice Secretary General Ma Shao-chang of the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Headed by SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung, the 20-member group will visit Beijing
and Shanxi Province to exchange views on journalistic exchanges with their
mainland counterparts and Chinese officials in charge of the media.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taiwan and China allow correspondents from their major media outlets
to remain on assignment on the other side for a maximum of three months on a
rotating basis.</P>
      <P>However, there have been calls for a "normalization" of journalistic exchanges
between Taiwan and China through the reciprocal establishment of media branches
or offices on each side.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan media delegation to China will include executives and senior
journalists from SET TV, Formosa TV and the Liberty Times, which in the past
were deemed as having embraced a pro-Taiwan independence stance.</P>
      <P>The SEF is a semi-official agency in charge of handling cross-strait affairs

      <P>A special Web site has been created to encourage migration to eastern Taiwan and
to promote the lifestyles of health and sustainability (LOHAS) and recreation
and health care service development in the region, an official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Construction and Planning Agency under the Ministry of the Interior took the
initiative to create the Web site at http:
//www.easthealthpark.com.tw/index.aspx to serve as an information service
platform that will help attract more long and short stay vacationers to eastern
Taiwan and encourage migration to the region, the official said.</P>
      <P>The new information service is also part of a comprehensive eastern Taiwan
sustainable development project launched by the government, the official
explained.</P>
      <P>In recent years, the official said, an increasing number of retirees and people
who intend to launch new businesses in the LOHAS and recreation sectors have
migrated to eastern Taiwan, mainly to Hualien City, Jian township, Taitung City
and Luyeh township.</P>
      <P>The new Web site will provide information about land development, housing sales
and leases, in an effort to attract potential migrants, the official said.</P>
      <P>Noting that eastern Taiwan boasts beautiful natural scenery and an expanse of
plains, the official said the region is particularly suitable for development of
LOHAS-related services and the recreation industry.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, the official said, the deep-sea water industry, recreational
farms, organic and non-toxic farming, and herbal and aromatic tree planting will
be prioritized mainly in Hualien City and Hualien County's Jian, Shoufong, Yuli,

      <P>Holland' s envoy to Taiwan, Menno Goedhart, said Wednesday that he may seek to
stay in Taiwan after his term expires next year.</P>
      <P>"I will seriously consider remaining in Taiwan following the expiration of my
current term, because I have my fellow 'tribesmen' here," Goedhart said at a
joint press conference with Tainan City Mayor Hsu Tien-tsai to promote Holland
Day activities.</P>
      <P>Since he was named the representative of the Netherlands Trade and Investment
Office in Taiwan seven years ago, Goedhart has toured almost every corner of
Taiwan, and has become an "elder" of the Rukai people, one of the 10-odd
aboriginal tribes of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Some citizens of Holland married local aborigines, mostly Rukais, during the
country's colonial rule of Taiwan between 1624 and 1661.</P>
      <P>Goedhart said he was the second foreigner to be awarded the honor of the "elder"
title by the Rukai group in Shantimen township in the southern Taiwan county of
Pingtung. The first foreign elder in the Rukai tribe was also a Hollander, in
the early 20th century.</P>
      <P>Goedhart said he would choose to live in Tainan City, which has granted him
honorary citizenship, once his wife agrees to stay in Taiwan instead of
returning to Europe.</P>
      <P>This year's Holland Day activities, the third consecutive event of its kind
organized by the Tainan City Government, will kick off Oct. 17.</P>
      <P>The event willl feature a bike tour of the area around the Chicano Tower on Oct.
17-18, and a "Shuwu" (tree-house) party and a rock-and-roll concert on Oct.
24-25, in which Holland's folk plays will be presented and traditional Dutch

      <P>A special Web site has been created to encourage migration to eastern Taiwan and
to promote the lifestyles of health and sustainability (LOHAS) and recreation

      <P>The Construction and Planning Agency under the Ministry of the Interior took the

sustainable development project launched by the government, the official
explained.</P>
      <P>In recent years, the official said, an increasing number of retirees and people

      <P>The Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) confirmed Wednesday that
there has recently been a huge influx of hot money into the country that could
have influenced the exchange rate of the New Taiwan dollar.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the issue during a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Finance
Committee, Central Bank Governor Perng Fai-nan told lawmakers that over the past
month, NT$500 billion (US$15.52 billion) in inward remittances had not been used
for stock investment but remained in transactional accounts held by foreign
investors.</P>
      <P>The reasonable balance in transactional accounts for stock investment is 3
percent of total remittances, or NT$100 billion in this case, Peng said, adding
that the excess amount of NT$400 billion was "intended for currency speculation"
according to the Central Bank's definition.</P>
      <P>Since early September, the New Taiwan dollar has risen by more than NT$0.07, or

downhill and settle in permanent houses to be built in Shanlin township,
Kaohsiung County, after their homes were destroyed by floods and mudslides
during the storm.</P>
      <P>Wu called for closer cooperation among the Executive Yuan, the Kaohsiung County
government and charity organizations to complete the housing project by mid-
February 2010.</P>
      <P>The state-run Taiwan Sugar Corp.  will make available its 58-hectare Yuehmei
farm in Shanlin township to accommodate 300 to 400 permanent houses for the
dislocated aborigines.</P>
      <P>Permanent houses for the displaced residents will also be built in the rural
township of Wulipu near Siaolin Village.</P>
      <P>The village was buried under tons of mud and about 400 residents presumed killed
in mudslides trigged by Typhoon Morakot Aug. 8.</P>
      <P>Wu also gave a directive for the construction of a museum and a memorial park
within one year to commemorate typhoon victims and those who died during rescue
operations and to preserve the cultural legacy and collective memories of
Siaolin village.</P>
      <P>The premier asked relevant agencies, including the Ministry of Justice,  the
National  Police Agency and Public  Construction Commission, to work as a team
to jointly oversee that the housing program  and other post-disaster
reconstruction  projects  are implemented smoothly and transparently.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he instructed the Council of Agriculture (COA) to come up with plans
to help find mountain ranger jobs for aborigines who are unemployed as a result
of the typhoon.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that incentives, such as cash rewards, be offered to
individuals and companies that contribute to forestation efforts.</P>

      <P>A 24-day-old baby girl was recently hospitalized with influenza A(H1N1) , the
youngest patient to be hospitalized in Taiwan with the new flu strain, health
authorities said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The newborn was diagnosed with the virus after she was taken to hospital Oct. 13
with symptoms that included a stuffy nose, fever, constant crying and agitation,
according to Centers for Disease Control Deputy Director-General Chou Jih-haw.</P>
      <P>The baby's fever was brought down after treatment and she is expected to recover
fully in a few days, Chou said.</P>
      <P>He said the infant could have been infected by her 14-month-old sister or 13
-year-old brother, both of whom had come down with flu-like symptoms.</P>
      <P>Noting  that infections  among young children  are usually transmitted from
family members, Chou advised people to wash their hands before attending to
children and suggested that people with flu-like symptoms avoid any contact with
children.</P>
      <P>The baby was among three new hospitalized H1N1 cases reported by the CDC
Thursday, the other two being a 45-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man.</P>
      <P>The total number of such cases since the outbreak began has reached 358, Chou
said.</P>
      <P>As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, 462 classes in 284 schools around the country remained
closed because of H1N1 infections  among the students. The number of affected
classes accounted for 0.31 percent of the total, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan successfully traces buzzard migration route</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 15 (CNA)
10/15/09  14:44:01
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After about a year of research, Taiwanese raptor experts recently succeeded in
tracing the migration patterns of the endangered grey-faced buzzard, the
Forestry Bureau under the Council of Agriculture said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The research team, which was financed by the Forestry Bureau, released its
findings that showed that grey-faced buzzards, an Asian bird of prey, usually
stop over in Taiwan every October on their way south to winter in the
Philippines.</P>
      <P>The raptors, known scientifically as Butastur indicus, then fly north in the
spring, making another stop in Taiwan before continuing on to the China-Russia
border near China's Heilongjiang Province or North Korea to breed, the
researchers found.</P>
      <P>Between 15,000 and 35,000 grey-faced buzzards stop in Taiwan on the route each
year, but prior to the latest research, little was known about their migration
habits.</P>
      <P>Keen to find out more about the birds' migration patterns, the research team,
including researchers from Academia Sinica and the non-profit Raptor Research
Group of Taiwan, tagged five adult buzzards caught in Kenting National Park in
southern Taiwan and the Mt. Bagua National Scenic Area in the central county of
Changhua in October 2008 and March of this year.</P>
      <P>The five birds were dubbed Cape No. 1-5 and then released.</P>
      <P>With the help of the satellite transmitters that were attached to the birds, the
researchers were able to track the movements of Cape No. 1, No. 2 and No. 5 and
trace precisely their previously mysterious migration routes.</P>
      <P>The researchers found that as of Oct. 12, the three birds had already  passed
through Taiwan and two were en route to the Philippines for the winter, while
one had already landed there.</P>
      <P>Cape No. 1 was found to have traveled over 12,000 km in a broad circle covering
the southern Philippines at the southernmost tip and Heilongjiang Province at
the northernmost tip, with Taiwan as a midway stop and a mountainous area in
China's northeastern Jilin Province as a rest stop for breeding in early June,
according to the bureau.</P>
      <P>Although Cape No. 1 arrived at its breeding ground later than Cape No. 2 and No.
5, it overtook the other two tagged birds and was the first to land in the
Philippines after a year-long migratory flight.</P>
      <P>It took refuge on a tiny island off China's Guangdong Province in March during
the strong northeast monsoon, recovering its strength before heading further
north around the end of May, the researchers were able to determine.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Cape No. 2 and No. 5 also flew over 12,000 km in a migration circle,
stopping at breeding grounds in a rural area of North Korea.</P>
      <P>The researchers lost contact with Cape No. 3 and No. 4 somewhere over the ocean
as the birds were flying north and their transmitters remained silent, according
to the Forestry Bureau.</P>
      <P>The recent findings -- the first migration data on grey-faced buzzards -- are a
good scientific foundation for further migration research, the bureau officials
said.</P>
      <P>The grey-faced buzzard is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES) and is
also protected as a Rare and Valuable Species under Taiwan's Wildlife
Conservation Act, according to the Forestry Bureau.</P>
      <P>The adult grey-faced buzzard stands 41-46 cm, has a grey head, breast and neck,
a white throat, a black moustache and mesial stripes, brown back and upper
wings, and brown bars on white underparts and underwings. The juvenile is brown
and mottled above, pale below with brown streaks, and has a broad white
supercilium and brown face.</P>
      <P>Generally, the southern migration areas of grey-faced buzzards are limited to
Southeast Asia. In summer, they breed in eastern areas of Asia, including
northern China, the Korean peninsula, an area southeast of the River Ussuri in
Russia, and Japan. When autumn comes, they migrate south to southeastern China,
Indochina, the Philippines, Borneo, the Celebes and New Guinea, although the
migration routes are still not clear.</P>
      <P>A few years ago, Japanese researchers were the first to implement satellite
positioning technology to track buzzards. They tagged and released several of
the raptors from the Japanese island of Ishigaki, hoping that they would fly
south, but the birds headed north instead.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan, one of the world's largest suppliers of diving suits, has developed the
first ever electro-thermal diving suit for deep, cold underwater environments,
Taiwan Textile Research Institute(TTRI) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The market potential of this new product is estimated at NT$100 million (US$ 3.1
million), TTRI said.</P>
      <P>The new electro-thermal diving suit is made from a special fiber, heated by
batteries, and can sustain water pressure at 50 meters below the surface, which
is a first, according to the institutes's Product Department Deputy Director Lee
Chen-liang.</P>
      <P>"At 30 meters, a diver encounters 4 atmospheres (atm) of pressure, so his diving
suit should be able to withstand that pressure and also keep his body warm," Lee
said, adding the suit's rechargeable batteries can last for three hours
underwater.</P>
      <P>He also explained that other thermal diving suits made in European countries are
mostly for water surface sports and not for deep-sea diving.</P>
      <P>TTRI has been in discussions with diving suits manufacturers on technology
transfer, and mass production of the new diving suits is expected to begin by
mid-2010, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is the world's largest manufacturer of diving suits, with an export
volume of 4 million suits a year and an 80 percent global market share,
according to TTRI.</P>
      <P>TTRI also introduced a new anti-allergy fiber made from skullcap herb and
chitin, which is a natural polymer. Another of its new products is a fiber-like
health monitoring system that can record the heart rate of patients with sleep
apnea syndrome.</P>
      <P>The 2009 Textile International Forum and Exhibition is being held Oct.14 - 16 at
the Taipei International Convention Center, with TTRI, Taiwan Textile Federation
and local manufacturers displaying their products at 38 booths.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou decorated 60 Taiwan troops Thursday for their
contribution to the rescue operations in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot, one
of the worst natural disasters to strike the country in half a century.</P>
      <P>Ma defended the military against criticism that it had not done enough to save
lives after the typhoon in August and that its performance had been below par
compared to its response after the devastating Sept. 21, 1999 earthquake.</P>
      <P>"Our soldiers have not grown dumber or lazier, as the critics have claimed. They
were two totally different situations after Typhoon Morakot and the 921
earthquake," Ma said.</P>
      <P>When the earthquake ended, the devastation stopped and there was no rain, which
was more conducive to rescue, Ma said, adding that after the 7.3 magnitude jolt,
the rescuers had time to get to the victims within the so-called golden 72
hours.</P>
      <P>However, he said, as an astounding 2965 mm of rain fell when Typhoon Morakot hit
Aug. 8-9, mountain residents and people living near rivers in southern, central
and eastern Taiwan had no time to flee, nor could they be saved, when the
mudslides and flash floods struck.</P>
      <P>"There was not even 72 seconds, let alone the golden 72 hours, to save them," he
said.</P>
      <P>He called for the country to avoid challenging nature and said it is better to
prevent natural disasters than to deal with their aftermath.</P>
      <P>He said that as a result of drastic global climate change over the past several
years, the power of the typhoons that have affected Taiwan has increased, as has
the volume of rainfall in the country.</P>
      <P>He said that the death toll from Typhoon Morakot could have been as high as
1,000 if rural township and village officials did not have effective evacuation
plans in place. The official death toll from the storm was 700, and thousands
were left homeless.</P>
      <P>He added that learning from the Typhoon Morakot experience, the government took
the best possible precautions against Typhoon Parma in early October, treating
it as if it was as dangerous as Morakot.</P>
      <P>Soldiers were mobilized and deployed to disaster-prone areas ahead of the
typhoon, he said.</P>
      <P>One person died in flooding caused by Parma, while 33 areas were inundated, with
agricultural losses totaling NT$38.38 million (US$1. 19 million).</P>
      <P>"The number of people evacuated this time was 7,863, compared to 6,400 during
Typhoon Morakot," Ma noted.</P>
      <P>During Typhoon Parma, some 1,300 people were evacuated from areas of Taipei,
Yilan and Hualien counties, which had high levels of rainfall.</P>
      <P>He said that in preparation for Parma, the number of people evacuated from non-
flood prone areas was five times more than in flood-prone areas, which showed
that residents were much more alert to the possibility of danger.</P>
      <P>Even before Parma hit Taiwan, Cabinet officials visited different areas of the
country to communicate with local governments on evacuation issues, while the
military also put servicemen on standby in potential disaster areas, the
president said.</P>
      <P>The government was harshly criticized for its slow response to Typhoon Morakot,
which led to the resignation of then-Premier Liu Chao-shiuan and some members of
his Cabinet.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's indigenous choreographer lends hand to typhoon-hit hometown</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/15/09  17:20:36</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Bulareyaung Pagarlava has traveled far as an internationally recognized
choreographer, but for villagers in the tribal community of Chialan Village in
the eastern Taiwan's Taitung County, the young man, who grew up in the village,
remains very close to them because he has never hesitated to contribute to his
hometown.</P>
      <P>The 35-year-old young artist of Paiwan tribe - one of 14 tribes of indigenous
Austronesians in Taiwan - has long been devoted to his childhood community. His
devotion was further demonstrated recently during the disaster brought by
Typhoon Morakot, which struck Taiwan in early August, bringing the worst
flooding and mudslides the island has seen in 50 years.</P>
      <P>Bulareyaung and his partner Fang-yi Sheu - a highly acclaimed dancer - were
working with dancers of the dance company they founded - LAFA and Artists
Company - on Aug. 8 when the shocking scenes of floods washing away half of
Chialan Village appeared on TV.</P>
      <P>"I was not aware of it until after the rehearsal when I checked my cell phone
and found numerous text messages from friends, including my teacher Lin Hwai-min
of the Cloud Gate Dance Theatre, inquiring about the safety of my family there,"
Bulareyaung told Central News Agency, remembering the day that Typhoon Morakot's
floods and mudslides brought deadly disaster to many regions in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Seeing the heartbreaking scenes on TV, Fang-yi and I decided to visit my
hometown and bring to my villagers the best support we can offer," he said.</P>
      <P>Bulareyaung and Fang-yi, who was principle dancer at the Martha Graham Dance
Company and has been constantly invited to perform in dance festivals in the
United States and Europe, founded the LAFA in May 2007 in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Despite the company being relatively young, its productions, such as "37 Arts"
and "Single Room," have already been well received in international dance
festivals in the past two years, though the founders' finances are far from
sufficient in managing a dance company.</P>
      <P>Having contacted his father who was evacuated with other villagers and being
told that the villagers were safe, Bulareyaung and Fang-yi started collecting
clothing and other supplies and sending them to Chialan Village.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, they were seeking ways to raise funds for the typhoon victims.</P>
      <P>"We were rehearsing for the Taipei Arts Festival in September. Fang-yi and I
decided that in addition to the three performances scheduled for September 4-6,
we would present an extra performance in the evening of Sept. 6 to raise funds
for the villagers," Bulareyaung said.</P>
      <P>At the charity performance in Taipei, LAFA dancers presented the Bulareyaung
choreographed "Lamentation", in addition to their regular repertoire "Ode to
Joy".</P>
      <P>The 15-minute production was derived from a four-minute piece of "Lamentation
Variations," which Bulareyaung choreographed for the Martha Graham Dance
Company's 2009 season presentations in New York in May.</P>
      <P>On the night of the charity performance, the small theater of the Wen-Shan
Branch of the Taipei Cultural Center was packed with audience members as Fang-
yi, Bulareyaung and two other male dancers presented the compelling work in
Gustav Mahler's Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen.</P>
      <P>In New York, Bulareyaung's "Lamentation" moved audiences as the evocation of
grief through the movements of the dancers gave them a cathartic experience. The
same experience was shared by his countrymen.</P>
      <P>After the Taipei charity performance, which raised NT$720,000 (US$22,500) for
typhoon victims, the couple traveled to Chialan Village.</P>
      <P>"We stayed at Chialan Village from Sept. 9-15, visiting the typhoon victims who
were still living in tents set up at an elementary school, distributing supplies
and relief money, NT$10,000 for each household, and cheering up the school
children in their classrooms," Bulareyaung said.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, the August calamity was not the first time that Chialan
villagers had lost their homes in typhoon and floods. Four years ago when Typoon
Haitang hit Taiwan in mid July, 17 houses in the village were washed away by
floodwaters, Bulareyaung said.</P>
      <P>He added that when Fang-yi and he were received by President Ma Ying-jeou in mid
June, he had told the President that the dike the government promised to build
to relieve flooding had still not been built yet.</P>
      <P>In the latest typhoon, 72 houses were washed away in the village of less than
100 households built on an old river bed.</P>
      <P>"The villagers were able to run for their lives on August 8 ... thanks to the
timely warning broadcast by the village chief at the wee hours that day,"
according to Bulareyaung.</P>
      <P>A very important task for Bulareyaung and Fang-yi during their week-long stay at
Chialan Village was to visit school children and try to cheer them up, as they
knew the distressed sentiment among the adults could be contaminating.</P>
      <P>The couple taught the kids a few dance moves, and shared with them the
importance of having goals and working hard to achieve one's goals.</P>
      <P>In recent years, Fang-yi and Bulareyaung have been invited to give speeches at
many university campuses not only about their dancing career, but also their
strive to achieve their goals in life.</P>
      <P>Both Bulareyaung and Fang-yi graduated from the National University of Arts in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>Upon graduation in 1994, Fang-yi received a full scholarship from the Council
for Cultural Affairs to study in the United States. She went to New York and
joined the Martha Graham Dance Company the next year. As a principle dancer at
the Martha Graham Company, Fang-yi made a name for herself in the artistic
circles in New York in the early 2000s. In 2005, she was featured on the cover
of Dance Magazine in "25 to Watch," as one of the rising young talents in
dancing.</P>
      <P>Joining Taiwan's renowned Cloud Gate Dance Theatre as a soloist after graduating
in 1996, Bulareyaung was praised as one of the "brightest stars on stage" by
Taiwan's Dance Magazine. In 1998, he received a Performing Arts Fellowship from
the Asian Culture Council to conduct advanced studies in New York. Upon
returning to Taiwan in 2000, Bulareyaung was invited by Lin Hwai-min, founder of
Cloud Gate, to rejoin the company as a dancer and a choreographer.</P>
      <P>Over the past few years, the couple has been among the Taiwanese dancers and
choreographers with the highest international exposure.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, both Bulareyaung and Fang-yi are always like a son and a daughter
living next door to the villagers in Chialan Village.</P>
      <P>Their pursuit of dance took them from Taiwan to New York and back. It has been a
long struggle, first to explore in a foreign land with limited support, and then
to make a difficult decision of giving up what they had achieved overseas and
coming home to develop their talents here.</P>
      <P>Despite their tight schedule of overseas tours and rehearsals with dancers and
musicians, Bulareyaung would spend some time at home four or five times a year.</P>
      <P>"The September visit (to Chialan Village) meant a lot to me and LAFA members,"
Bulareyaung said. "I was told by elders in the village that some teachers in
local schools have made Fang-yi and me role models, and we were deeply moved
facing the exciting young faces there."</P>
      <P>They would have stayed longer, if not for a new project scheduled earlier.</P>
      <P>Embracing the world and caring for his native people are equally important for

      <P>Construction of factory buildings for biotechnology research and development at
Taiwan's Hsinchu Biomedical Science Park (HBSP) started Thursday, and was
expected to completed by the end of 2010, a park official said.</P>
      <P>The science park, which is located in northern Taiwan's Hsinchu city to bring in
30 manufacturers once all the factory buildings have been completed, officials
said.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan has many science and high-tech parks, biotechnology is a relatively
new field which the government has recently identified as an industry the
country can focus on. The Hsinchu park will be the first major biotechnology
park in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Randy Yen, Director of the Hsinchu Science Park Administration, said some 20
companies have expressed an interest in setting up new factory buildings in the
park. The companies are mostly medical apparatus and pharmaceuticals companies
engaged in research and development for new medicine.</P>
      <P>With the first stage of infrastructure construction of the science park
completed, the start of the factory construction means that the HBSP has entered
the second stage of development, Yen said.</P>
      <P>The park's research center and incubation center are expected to be completed by
2013 and begin operations in 2014, Yen said.</P>
      <P>He added that a national-level medical center will be completed by 2014 and
become operational in 2015.</P>
      <P>The planned medical center, to be named the National Hsinchu Hospital, will have
475 conventional patient care beds and 25 beds for patients with acute mental
disorders, according to Hsinchu county's health officials.</P>
      <P>Kuo Ming-liang, the Head of the National Science Council's Department of Life
Sciences, said earlier this week that the government hopes to form two biotech
clusters located in the Hsinchu Biomedical Science Park in northern Taiwan and
in the Southern Taiwan Science Park in the south.</P>
      <P>The biotech clusters will enable Taiwan to boost its output of medical equipment
and devices to NT$250 billion (US$7.74 billion) in 2015, Kuo said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan said Thursday that it generally welcomes Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald
Tsang's plans to visit and to open an office here.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan made the remarks in
response to questions raised by lawmakers on the legislative floor.</P>
      <P>"The MAC welcomes all measures aimed at increasing visits by officials and
exchanges between Taiwan and Hong Kong," Lai said.</P>
      <P>Tsang in his annual policy report to Hong Kong's Legislative Council Wednesday
revealed a series of measures, including the establishment of a multi-functional
office in Taiwan at an appropriate time, to enhance the territory's relations
with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At a press conference held following the council's meeting, Tsang also said he
hopes to visit Taiwan before his term expires in 2012.</P>
      <P>Regarding the proposed Hong Kong office, Lai said "the MAC will see what kind of
office it would be," since the MAC has allocated NT$10 million to establish a
Taiwan-Hong Kong Economic and Cultural Cooperation Promotion Committee in
accordance with consensus reached between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The planned committee will serve as a major platform to strengthen Taiwan-Hong
Kong exchanges, but the the details will become clearer after it has been
formally inaugurated, she said.</P>
      <P>In a press conference on June 5, then MAC Vice Chairman Fu Dong-cheng and
visiting Hong Kong Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Stephen Lam
Sui-lung jointly announced that Taiwan will establish a Taiwan-Hong Kong
committee while Hong Kong will open a Hong Kong-Taiwan Trade Cooperation
Commission under its Trade Development Council, to promote trade, investment,
travel and cultural exchanges between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Currently, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, which is financially
supported by the Hong Kong government, maintains an office in Taipei that deals
solely with trade matters and does not represent the Hong Kong government.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lai called on the Hong Kong government to simplify visa procedures
for Taiwan citizens to make their visits to Hong Kong more convenient.</P>

      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu Thursday urged pro-independence groups to be rational,
after they unveiled a plan to demonstrate against the upcoming cross-Taiwan
Strait talks to be held in the central city in December.</P>
      <P>According to Hu, the continuation of talks between Taiwan and China is
beneficial to both sides, since Taiwan cannot pretend not to see China and
cannot close the door to dialogue with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Holding  the talks  in Taiwan  will also lead  to better understanding of Taiwan
on the part of the Chinese officials, Hu said.</P>
      <P>He urged the pro-independence activists to pay attention to whether Taiwan's
interests are being compromised in the talks, rather than reject all contact
with China.</P>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)  announced Tuesday that Taichung has been
selected as the venue for the fourth meeting between Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and China's Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) President Chen Yunlin.</P>
      <P>They are expected to sign four agreements regarding fishing labor cooperation,
agricultural  quarantine  inspection,  standards, inspection and certification
for industrial products,  and the avoidance of double taxation.</P>
      <P>The  plan,  however,  drew  immediate  opposition  from pro-independence groups
in central Taiwan, which vowed to mobilize like-minded organizations from
southern Taiwan to stage a peaceful demonstration during the Chiang-Chen talks.</P>
      <P>Lin Heng-li, vice president of the Central Taiwan Society, said Thursday that
the groups are opposed to any agreements signed by Chiang and Chen,  because
such agreements are not subject to supervision by the Legislative Yuan or the
opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Pro-independence  groups  led by the opposition  Democratic Progressive Party
held massive protests in the streets of Taipei when Chen last visited Taiwan in
November 2008 for his second round of talks with Chiang.</P>
      <P>The protests turned violent when some demonstrators threw bottles and rocks at
police and toppled police barricades. Police responded by spraying the
protesters with water, scuffling with some of them, and arresting others.</P>

      <P>About 60,000 foreign residents in Taiwan have not yet applied for the new
electronic resident cards to replace the paper versions that will no longer be
valid from Feb. 1, 2010, the National Immigration Agency (NIA) under the
Ministry of the Interior reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>People who fail to obtain the new electronic alien resident certificate (ARC),
alien permanent resident certificate (APRC) or ROC (Taiwan) resident certificate
by Dec. 31 this year will not be able to apply for driver's licenses, national
health insurance or bank accounts in Taiwan, NIA officials said.</P>
      <P>In September, the agency sent notifications to the 60,000 people still holding
the paper versions of the three types of foreign resident cards, urging them to
apply for their new IC cards at NIA service centers across the country, the
officials noted.</P>
      <P>The electronic resident cards not only help protect the holders' personal rights
and interest, but also help the government to implement its anti-forgery and
cost-effective drives that were launched in July 2007, they said.</P>
      <P>Multiple entry permits, which were previously stamped in the holder's passport,
are now embedded in the IC cards, along with the holder's personal data.</P>
      <P>Some 500,000 foreign nationals were required to replace their resident cards
when the new electronic versions were introduced in July 2007.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Experts tout benefits of remote medical care giving system</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A remote medical care system will not only enable patients to receive medical
attention without traveling long distance, thus saving time and money, but also
allow hospitals to collect a wide array of patient information through the
system, an executive at the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>At a seminar on remote health care applications and technology standardization,
Shau Yio-wha,  director  of the ITRI Medical Electronics and Device Technology
Center, said that when patients seek medical help in hospital, about 45 percent
of their time was spent on getting medical checks and waiting for doctors to
make medical records. However, if patients can send their medical records to
hospitals before receiving medical care through a long distance care system,
plenty of time can be saved.</P>
      <P>Such a system will also help improve outpatient registration accuracy, Shau
added.</P>
      <P>The value of long distance home medical care not only lies in the costs savings,
but in improving the quality of medical care for patients, particularly those
with chronic illnesses and who need long term care, according ot Shau.</P>
      <P>Lyn McFarlane, general manager of business operations from U.K.-based Tunstall,
a leading provider of telecare and telehealth solutions, said that using a
remote health care system will help boost patients' self-confidence, alleviate
their anxiety, increase their peace of mind and sense of security, as well as
promote greater patient self-management.</P>
      <P>For example, McFarlane said that Tunstall used a telehealth system to monitor 30
high-risk patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in their
own homes in Sheffield, Scotland.</P>
      <P>Five month later, results showed that telecare in the 30 patients' homes helped
reduce the rate of hospital visits by them by 50 percent and the number of home
visits by medical personnel by 80 percent. The system was estimated to have
saved UKG1.2 million in medical costs a year for hospitals, according to
McFarlane.</P>
      <P>The patients also showed improvement in scores on the Depression Anxiety Stress
Scales (DASS), she added.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years, a number of companies in Taiwan have ventured into
the telecare arena, but the pace of development of this type of service was
still slow, McFarlane said.</P>
      <P>She urged Taiwan's government to pioneer a trial system and conduct related
evaluation for the launch of remote medical care services.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan hopes to sign cross-strait trade pact as soon as possible</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan hopes to sign an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) ,
similar to a free trade agreement, with China as soon as possible, Minister of
Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"We expect the proposed ECFA accord can be signed next year, but if the goal can
be reached earlier, it would be more than welcome, " Shih said, while fielding
questions at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government has argued that an ECFA agreement with China should be
signed as soon as possible to reduce the impact on Taiwanese businesses once
economic integration of China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) comes into force next year.</P>
      <P>After the China-ASEAN free trade agreement takes effect on Jan. 1, 2010,
petrochemical products, textiles, automobile parts and machinery exports from
ASEAN states to China will enjoy tariff-free treatment, which government
officials said will seriously undermine the competitiveness of similar products
from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, officials from both sides of the Taiwan Strait will hold a
fourth round of informal talks on the ECFA deal late this month and formal talks
are expected to get underway later this year.</P>
      <P>An unidentified official from Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs said last
week that the two sides have held three rounds of informal talks on the proposed
ECFA deal and one more round of informal talks will be held later this month for
them to exchange their "early harvest" lists.</P>
      <P>"When that happens, the lists of industries or services that each side will open
for immediate tariff concessions or more liberal trade terms will become clear,"
the official said at the time.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, Shih said Taiwan has not yet fully finalized its "early harvest"
list, but he added that the number of items to be listed will be fewer than
1,000.</P>
      <P>During the previous rounds of informal talks,  Shih said, Taiwanese officials
clearly told their Chinese counterparts that Taiwan will not open its labor
market to Chinese workers nor will it expand the list of agricultural items that
are now allowed to enter the Taiwanese market.</P>
      <P>On legislators' concerns that the ECFA, similar to free trade agreements, may
adversely affect Taiwan, Shih said the pact will generate more positive effects
than negative ones.</P>
      <P>"Signing a cross-strait ECFA will definitely help boost Taiwan's gross domestic
product (GDP) and create more job openings, " Shih said, adding that it will
bring not only short-term gains but also long-term benefits.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that the proposed accord will adversely impact some labor-
intensive industries, Shih said the government will come up with special
programs to help makers in disadvantaged industries, such as towels, bedroom
facilities and hosiery, to transform, upgrade or switch to other lines of
business.</P>
      <P>Critics of the plan to sign the free-trade agreement with China have also
expressed fears it could lead to Taiwan being more economically dependent on
China, which they said could jeopardize Taiwan's sovereignty and independence.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials
Thursday:</P>
      <P>LIBERTY TIMES:</P>
      <P>Why is President Ma mum on China's overt intimidation?</P>
      <P>China criticized Kaohsiung City Wednesday over its recent actions -- its
invitation to the Dalai Lama to visit Taiwan and its screening of a documentary
on Uighur political activist Rebiya Kadeer -- and said it is only natural for
Beijing to express its displeasure by boycotting the city as a tourism
destination.</P>
      <P>It is incredible that China can dictate the travel plans of its people, which
only shows that it is an authoritarian country.</P>
      <P>Soon after he took office, President Ma Ying-jeou opened Taiwan to Chinese
tourists, saying that if 3,000 Chinese tourists a day visit Taiwan, it would
mean one million arrivals from China per year and generate NT$60 billion in
revenue.</P>
      <P>Chinese tourism is in fact used by Beijing as leverage to achieve its political
ends, as it has done in Hong Kong and Macau.</P>
      <P>We have suggested before that Taiwan try to attract tourists from Japan, the
United States and Europe, who are rich and genteel, instead of Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Ma's beautiful dream of an influx of Chinese tourists is now broken. Faced with
the gutless Ma administration, we urge Taiwanese to refrain from going to China.
Taiwanese make 4 million visits to China a year, compared with only 620,000
Chinese arrivals in Taiwan in the period Jan.-Aug. this year. Taiwanese should
tour Taiwan instead to regain their dignity and avoid being intimidated by the
rouge country.</P>
      <P>UNITED DAILY NEWS: What the Supreme Court should do</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court rejected last week the High Court's decision to detain former
President Chen Shui-bian without giving its legal opinions.</P>
      <P>Instead, it focused on the factual aspect. The Supreme Court said that the High
Court had not stated clearly how Chen would conceal his huge assets overseas and
that he was more familiar with the channels of escape than the average people.</P>
      <P>The High Court then held a hearing on Chen's detention and ruled that the former
president, who has been in detention since late last year, should still be kept
behind bars.</P>
      <P>The chance of a successful appeal from a detained felony perpetrator is very
rare. The protagonist in this case is a former president, but the Supreme Court
has failed to take the opportunity to establish credibility when rejecting the
High Court's original decision.</P>
      <P>The reason could be attributed to its system as well as the lack of mission to
take up the responsibility and an ambition to give its "best" legal views, so
that it has tainted its "supreme" reputation.</P>
      <P>APPLE DAILY:</P>
      <P>Interior minister's contradictory views</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah was questioned recently by graduate students at
National Taiwan University (NTU).</P>
      <P>The students questioned Jiang on why his interpretation of the Parade and
Assembly Law now (when people want to protest against the current government)
are different from the views he expressed about the law when the "red shirt
army" protesters were protesting against then-president Chen Shui-bian in 2006.</P>
      <P>Jiang was teaching at NTU in 2006.</P>
      <P>The students also noticed that Jiang refused to allow the entry of Rebiya Kadeer
to Taiwan, citing the reason that she had connections to a terrorist group,
which was contradictory to his advocacy of freedom.</P>
      <P>The ideology and attitude required by a scholar and official might be completely
opposite, but we still hope that as an intellectual, he be consistent.</P>
      <P>If he is forced to compromise with the reality, he could only budge in the
technical aspect, but should not comprise on principles or the strategic aspect.</P>
      <P>CHINA TIMES: Taiwan's finances are very much like the song 'Hotel California'</P>
      <P>"Hotel California" is a classic song by U.S. rock band "The Eagles" in the
1970s. At the end of the song, the lyrics " You can check-out any time you like,
But you can never leave" could best describe the current state of the Executive
Yuan's Tax Reform Commission.</P>
      <P>Check-out is a formality, but leave will be an actual release. The commission
presently fiddles with the formality, but has in substance contributed little to
the nation's tax reform and financial structure.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's tax burden rate at 14 percent is one of the lowest in the world. With
the huge expenditure on social welfare and development projects, as well as
flood-relief, the financial situation is in tatters.</P>
      <P>But the financial authorities, who dare not face the problem of insufficient tax
revenues, have instead led the tax cuts over the past year.</P>
      <P>They have built a debt-ridden Hotel Calidonia for Taiwan. Even though they are
stranded within, they still ignore the problems.</P>
      <P>We sincerely hope a truly responsible finance minister could be found to address
the financial woes and get us out of the woods of the hotel.</P>

      <P>An online game developed by Taiwan's top research institute Academia Sinica was
unveiled Thursday to allow players to learn more about Chinese characters and
appreciate the beauty of the Chinese language.</P>
      <P>The game, dubbed Chinese Scrabble and crafted by researchers from the Institute
of Linguistics and the Institute of History and Philology at Academia Sinica,
allows players to tell, via a thinning method, how a Chinese character is made
up with radicals.</P>
      <P>The game is the latest result of a collaboration between the two institutes
since 2002 to carry out a language archive project, which has now entered its
second phase.</P>
      <P>The game was only one small part of a digital archives exhibition titled
"Language in Space and Time, " that was opened at Academia Sinica, located in
Taipei City's northeastern suburb on Nankang.</P>
      <P>The exhibition features five themes, including digitalized archives of oral
languages used by Taiwanese indigenous people and their ancestors, all of whom
belong to the Austronesian language family.</P>
      <P>Also on display are digital reproductions and grammatical annotations of words
carved on excavated oracle bones, bronzes, and bamboo, or imprinted on silk
documents. The displays also include other ancient Chinese texts passed down
through the millennia.</P>
      <P>The digitized recordings and transcriptions of the Taiwan Min and Hakka
dialects, and an archive of the sounds of modern Chinese are also on display.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of the exhibition, Sun Tien-hsin, director of the
Institute of Linguistics, said: "In the past, linguistic records could only be
preserved in written form on shells and bones, bronze, bamboo, stone, paper,
silk, and so on, whereas nowadays we can not only use digitization methods to
reproduce such records and annotate them, but we can also make use of multimedia
to record and further analyze the oral language."</P>
      <P>At the exhibition, visitors can also choose to make their own electronic New
Year's greeting cards using oracle bones or bronze inscription characters.</P>

a Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"I hope a mechanism can be established before the end of this year," said MAC

completion of inter-agency discussions, the government is ready to put into
effect regulations governing Chinese tourism offices in Taiwan, paving the way
for China to open such an office in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China reached an agreement June 13 to allow visits to the island by
Chinese tourists and the reciprocal establishment of tourism offices on either
side of the strait.</P>
      <P>However, Liu declined to confirm or deny a news report that Liu Guishan, vice

      <P>Work on 50 bridges listed as requiring repair is being carried out according to
schedule and is expected to be completed by 2010, while another 52 bridges
damaged by Typhoon Morakot  in early August will be repaired  within two years,
Director-General of Highways Lin Chih- ming said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Five of the 50 bridges listed last year as old and dilapidated have already been
fixed and the Directorate General of Highways (DGH) under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) has been working to repair the
remaining 45 on schedule, despite the additional workload caused by the 52 other
bridges damaged by the typhoon, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>While most of the 52 bridges received  partial damage by typhoon-triggered
flooding or mudslides, their structures are still considered sound without
serious problems, which means that the two-year window for repairs should be
achievable, Lin noted.</P>
      <P>He was responding to inquiries by legislators on whether a promise made by
former Premier Liu Chao-shiuan June 23 that there will be no more dangerous
bridges in the country within two years can be fulfilled.</P>

      <P>The Taipei office of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) said Wednesday that
it will open an international traveling photo exhibition in Taipei to introduce
the history of jazz in the United States.</P>
      <P>With America the birthplace of jazz, and Taiwan displaying an ever greater
appreciation for this art form, AIT is honored to present this exhibition in
collaboration with the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts at the very moment
Taichung celebrates its Jazz Festival," Scott Robinson, chief of AITs American
Cultural Center, was quoted as saying in a press release.</P>
      <P>"We hope that audiences from throughout Taiwan will enjoy it.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, titledJazz Session: Americas Jazz Ambassadors Embrace the
World,is scheduled to be held from Oct. 17 - Nov. 29, and will feature 55
photographs that chronicle the history of the famed Jazz Ambassadorsprogram.</P>
      <P>The program sent some of Americas most renowned jazz musicians to perform
throughout the world during the 1950s, '60s and '70s, according to the AIT.</P>
      <P>With U.S. government sponsorship, such legendary jazz greats as Louis Armstrong,
Dave Brubeck, Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, Dizzy Gillespie, Benny Goodman, Sarah
Vaughn and many others showcased America's talent and diversity, and the power
of music to bridge cultural and political differences, the AIT added.</P>
      <P>AIT will also present several educational programs in conjunction with the photo
exhibit.</P>
      <P>These include a Nov. 15 lecture by Gene Aitken, a renowned American jazz scholar
and band leader. Aitken will offer perspective on the impact of the
international tours by the Jazz Ambassadors.</P>
      <P>Also scheduled are two gallery tours on Oct. 17 and Nov. 29 by Hsieh Chi-pin,

      <P>Taiwan's top envoy to Japan expressed hope Thursday that an exhibition
featuring treasures from Taipei's National Palace Museum (NPM) can be staged in
Japan in view of the frequent exchanges between the two countries.</P>
      <P>"Over the past year since I assumed office, I have felt strongly that the deep-
rooted relationship between the two countries has progressed markedly thanks to
President Ma Ying-jeou's firm support, and one of the major goals for me in this
post is to help make such an exhibition in this country a reality, " John C. T.
Feng told reporters from Taiwan at his official residence in Tokyo.</P>
      <P>"It would be a great achievement for me if I could make that happen," he said,
adding that "first lady Chow Mei-ching could pay a visit to Japan and help
inject greater momentum to bolster two- way Taiwan-Japan cultural exchanges."</P>
      <P>The envoy is pinning his hopes on the fact that Japanese tourists make up the
bulk of visitors to the NPM, with more than 30 million having visited Taiwan to
date.</P>
      <P>According to Feng, several Japanese dietmen have told him they are interested in
visiting the NPM to view an exhibition on the Yongzheng Emperor -- the fourth
emperor of the Qing Dynasty --- which opened at the NPM Oct. 7 and will run
through Jan. 10, 2010 in cooperation with Beijing's Palace Museum.</P>
      <P>In addition, he went on, Japan's mainstream media organizations also have a keen
interest in the idea of holding an exhibition of NPM artifacts on Japanese soil.</P>
      <P>Feng said the government of Taiwan hopes Japan's parliament will work out
legislation to provide a safety guarantee for NPM objects exhibited in Japan,
but he added that a bill in this regard, which had almost been agreed upon by
then ruling and opposition lawmakers, has been stalled in the lower house as a
result of Japan's transfer of power in July.</P>

    <HEADLINE>State capital in memory chip firm will not exceed NT$10 billion</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan's government will invest in an innovative memory chip company to a
maximum of NT$10 billion (US$310.56 million), and only if such an enterprise can
secure core technology and help Taiwan to stay competitive in the field,
Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Shih made the remarks at a Legislative Yuan committee session during which
ruling Kuomintang Legislator Lai Shyh-bao expressed concern about a government
plan to form a DRAM chip company in a joint venture with foreign and local
private makers.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, the government announced the formation of Taiwan Memory Co.
(TMC) as part of its efforts to consolidate the country's DRAM industry. Japan's
Elpida Memory Inc. and several local companies have agreed to join the TMC
project to develop new memory chip technology. TMC was later renamed the Taiwan
Innovation Memory Co. (TIMC).</P>
      <P>In July, the government said it had allocated NT$30 billion in state funds to
help DRAM chip makers to restructure, as they had been struggling in their
worst-ever downturn amid the global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>TIMC is the only company so far to have requested such state funds before the
government's deadline expires next week.</P>
      <P>At Thursday's legislative session, Lai questioned the propriety of the
government continuing with the TIMC project now that the DRAM industry's
business situation has improved.</P>
      <P>"The going price of a DRAM chip is US$2.50, higher than its cost of US$2...
Against this backdrop, does the industry still need government bailout?" Lai
asked.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lai went on, TIMC could become yet another money-losing company like
the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp., in which the government also has a large
stake.</P>
      <P>"The status of TIMC is confusing and opaque... I'm afraid it could become
another THSRC," Lai said.</P>
      <P>In response, Shih said the government's stance on the DRAM industry
restructuring is crystal clear and not confusing at all.</P>
      <P>"The Ministry of Economic Affairs will not inject money into any venture that
cannot obtain core technology, " Shih said, adding that only companies that can
gain technology transfers from foreign counterparts and join forces in
developing new technology will receive government capital injection.</P>
      <P>According to the TIMC's funding application, Shih went on, the company will
focus its operations on research and development. In addition, it will also
later acquire chip plants for production.</P>
      <P>Stressing that TIMC is a private enterprise, Shih said the government is still
screening its capital application.</P>
      <P>"We will decide on whether to invest in the company only after extensive
discussion and careful assessment, " Shih continued, adding that even if the
ministry finally decides to invest in the company, its stake will not surpass
half of the total shares.</P>
      <P>He further said that other DRAM makers are still welcome to file similar
applications.</P>
      <P>"We will screen those projects in a fair and transparent manner with the
paramount criteria being that the project must be able to help DRAM core
technology take root in Taiwan," the minister added.</P>
      <P>According to principles unveiled by the ministry in August, applicants'
proposals would have to include plans for developing technology with foreign
firms, as well as strategies such as mergers and acquisitions.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's six DRAM makers have suffered from a supply glut as the global economic
slump has sapped demand for electronics and machinery run with semiconductors.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs proposed the establishment of TIMC in March in
the hope that it will focus on technological development to help local
chipmakers compete with their South Korean counterparts, aided by technology
from American and Japanese makers.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday that his administration will work harder to
attract more students from overseas to study at Taiwan's colleges and
universities as part of its efforts to boost the country's "soft power
diplomacy."</P>
      <P>Ma made the pledge while meeting with several of his national policy advisers.</P>
      <P>Noting that local universities are facing an ever-deteriorating plight of
failing to recruit enough students because of Taiwan's declining birth rate, Ma
said the government should take more active steps  to  help  those  schools
enhance  their  international competitiveness and attract more students from
overseas.</P>
      <P>"If local universities can attract more foreign students, their enrollment
deficiency problems can be partially resolved," Ma said.</P>
      <P>According to the president, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) and the
Ministry of Education are studying the possibility of launching courses
conducted entirely in English under the Taiwan Scholarship program.</P>
      <P>The MOFA is also considering increasing the number of overseas students eligible
to receive government-funded scholarships, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"Through these efforts, we hope to raise the ratio of foreign students in local
universities to 2.6 percent from the current 1.3 percent," he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan appropriates less than 0.15 percent of its annual gross
domestic product (GDP) for foreign aid projects, Ma pointed out that the figure
is far less than the 0.7 percent of GDP advocated by the Paris-based
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) for its member
states.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is not an OECD member, Ma continued, Taiwan can increase its
foreign aid by offering more scholarships to attract students from overseas to
study at its universities.</P>
      <P>"By so doing we can contribute to global educational development while
increasing local universities' global competitiveness," Ma said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Eric Li-luan Chu instructed the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) Thursday to formulate mechanisms to stimulate private
investment by efficiently using the huge excess reserves of approximately NT$4.6
trillion held by domestic banks,  according  to CEPD Secretary-General  Liao
Yaw-chung.</P>
      <P>Chu said during a visit to the top economic planning agency that in September,
deposits held by the banks had reached NT$22.6 trillion, while loans from the
banks amounted to about NT$18 trillion, resulting in Taiwan's financial
institutions being awash in idle funds.</P>
      <P>The vice premier said the CEPD should map out mechanisms to inject these funds
into the nation's infrastructure  programs, including the i-Taiwan 12
Infrastructure Projects -- 12 prioritized public construction projects aimed at
regenerating Taiwan's economic miracle -- Liao said after the meeting.</P>
      <P>Chu was cited as saying that since 2000, the vast majority of domestic funds
have been invested in financial products, with only a small portion of the money
funnelled into concrete projects.</P>
      <P>If the government can come up with new incentive programs to attract more
private investment in public construction projects, that would not only help
create jobs but also resolve the government's problems in seeking financial
resources to fund the projects, Liao cited Chu as saying.</P>
      <P>In response, the CEPD promised that it will set up a special task force,
authorize experts to conduct short-term research plans, and convene expert
meetings in a bid to put the idle funds to good use, Liao said.</P>
      <P>The i-Taiwan 12 projects were a major plank in the election campaign platform of
President Ma Ying-jeou. The projects call for the investment of NT$3.99 trillion
over the next eight years, with NT$2.65 trillion of the total coming from the
government and NT$1.34 trillion from the private sector.</P>

      <P>Three e-projects by Taiwanese organizations have made the finalist list of the
2009 eASIA Awards, the Institute for Information Industry (III) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The three projects are an intelligent retail e-hub by Trade- Van Information
Services, an APEC digital opportunity center (ADOC) by the III and a rapid
distribution network by PChome.</P>
      <P>This year's award-winners will be announced at the eASIA Night in conjunction
with the plenary session of the Asia Pacific Council for Trade Facilitation and
Electronic Business (AFACT) Nov. 15 in New Delhi, India.</P>
      <P>III CEO Ke Chih-sheng said the three are among six entries Taiwan recommended
for the award, which is aimed at recognizing the significance and great efforts
made within the AFACT community and to encourage experience-sharing in
e-programs.</P>
      <P>Ke added that Taiwan is facing sharp competition for the awards from South
Korea, which is better than Taiwan at showcasing the superiority of its
products.</P>
      <P>Chung Su-fang, deputy director of the Bureau of Standards, Metrology and
Inspection under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, said that the current
international economic crisis has not impacted the development of Taiwan's
information and communications technology sector and that vying for the eASIA

      <P>Taiwan's government will investigate whether a Hong Kong financial consortium
that has won a bid to acquire the Taipei-based Nan Shan Life Insurance Co. has
any Chinese shareholders who hold sway in the group, a senior official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang made the remarks at a Legislative
Yuan committee session amid mounting concern about a possible Chinese entry into
Taiwan's insurance market through the Hong Kong consortium's acquisition of Nan
Shan Life.</P>
      <P>American International Group Inc. (AIG) announced Tuesday that it had agreed to
sell its 97.57 percent share of Nan Shan Life -- its Taiwanese unit -- to a
consortium led by Hong Kong's Primus Financial Holdings for US$2.15 billion
(NT$69.3 billion).</P>
      <P>Shih said the deal is still pending screening by the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>"If we find that the consortium has any influential Chinese shareholders  as its
members,  we will refuse to approve the acquisition deal," Shih said.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan has not yet opened its financial service market, including
the insurance industry, to Chinese investment, Shih said the MOEA's Investment
Commission will carefully examine the Nan Shan deal once it receives relevant
documents.</P>
      <P>The consortium led by Hong Kong's Primus Financial Holdings has not yet sent its
Nan Shan acquisition deal to the Investment Commission for screening, Shih said.</P>
      <P>In addition to checking whether the consortium has any Chinese shareholders who
directly or indirectly control more than 30 percent of the group's stake, Shih
said the commission will also investigate whether the group has any Chinese
citizens who hold sway in its operations.</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan's regulations, the Nan Shan transaction will be examined first by
the MOEA's Investment Commission and then sent to the Financial Supervisory
Commission for final approval.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Eric Li-luan Chu instructed the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) Thursday to formulate mechanisms to stimulate private
investment by efficiently using the huge excess reserves of approximately NT$4.6
trillion held by domestic banks,  according  to CEPD Secretary-General  Liao
Yaw-chung.</P>
      <P>Chu said during a visit to the top economic planning agency that in September,
deposits held by the banks had reached NT$22.6 trillion, while loans from the
banks amounted to about NT$18 trillion, resulting in Taiwan's financial
institutions being awash in idle funds.</P>
      <P>The vice premier said the CEPD should map out mechanisms to inject these funds
into the nation's infrastructure  programs, including the i-Taiwan 12
Infrastructure Projects -- 12 prioritized public construction projects aimed at
regenerating Taiwan's economic miracle -- Liao said after the meeting.</P>
      <P>Chu was cited as saying that since 2000, the vast majority of domestic funds
have been invested in financial products, with only a small portion of the money
funnelled into concrete projects.</P>
      <P>If the government can come up with new incentive programs to attract more
private investment in public construction projects, that would not only help
create jobs but also resolve the government's problems in seeking financial
resources to fund the projects, Liao cited Chu as saying.</P>
      <P>In response, the CEPD promised that it will set up a special task force,
authorize experts to conduct short-term research plans, and convene expert
meetings in a bid to put the idle funds to good use, Liao said.</P>
      <P>The i-Taiwan 12 projects were a major plank in the election campaign platform of
President Ma Ying-jeou. The projects call for the investment of NT$3.99 trillion
over the next eight years, with NT$2.65 trillion of the total coming from the
government and NT$1.34 trillion from the private sector.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's government will investigate whether a Hong Kong financial consortium
that has won a bid to acquire the Taipei-based Nan Shan Life Insurance Co. has
any Chinese shareholders who hold sway in the group, a senior official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang made the remarks at a Legislative

Taiwan's insurance market through the Hong Kong consortium's acquisition of Nan
Shan Life.</P>
      <P>American International Group Inc. (AIG) announced Tuesday that it had agreed to
sell its 97.57 percent share of Nan Shan Life -- its Taiwanese unit -- to a
consortium led by Hong Kong's Primus Financial Holdings for US$2.15 billion

      <P>Shih said the deal is still pending screening by the Ministry of Economic

      <P>"If we find that the consortium has any influential Chinese shareholders  as its
members,  we will refuse to approve the acquisition deal," Shih said.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan has not yet opened its financial service market, including
the insurance industry, to Chinese investment, Shih said the MOEA's Investment
Commission will carefully examine the Nan Shan deal once it receives relevant
documents.</P>
      <P>The consortium led by Hong Kong's Primus Financial Holdings has not yet sent its
Nan Shan acquisition deal to the Investment Commission for screening, Shih said.</P>
      <P>In addition to checking whether the consortium has any Chinese shareholders who

said the commission will also investigate whether the group has any Chinese
citizens who hold sway in its operations.</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan's regulations, the Nan Shan transaction will be examined first by

      <P>Ma made the pledge while meeting with several of his national policy advisers.</P>

the school curriculum, they seem less keen to give their children a free hand to
practice money management in their daily lives, according to the results of a
survey released Thursday by Global Views magazine.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted Sept. 6-9 among 1,094 parents with children aged 15 and
younger. The samplings -- 497 parents from urban regions and 597 others from
non-urban regions -- had margins of error of 4.4 percent and 4 percent,
respectively.</P>
      <P>The results reveal that the majority of respondents agree that elementary and
secondary students should learn about the correct ways of handling money, with
57.4 percent supporting a Ministry of Education plan to make financial knowledge
a subject in the Basic Competence Test for junior high school students.</P>
      <P>However, the results show that 64.7 percent of parents do not give their
children pocket money, leaving them little chance of hands-on practice in using
money.</P>
      <P>Also, as most parents tend to do financial planning on behalf of their children,
the kids have no chance to choose how to manage their finances.</P>
      <P>The situation is demonstrated in the fact that 81.7 percent of parents buy
insurance policies for their children, while among those who do give their
children pocket money and those who have opened savings accounts for their
children, 62.1 percent would require the children to save money.</P>
      <P>Nearly 88 percent of parents would allow their children to decide how to spend
their pocket money, and 60.6 percent would pay attention to how the money was
spent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 53.1 percent of parents do not discuss family finances with their
children, which might prevent the children's early exposure to life's realities.</P>
      <P>On the concepts parents think their children should acquire with regard to
money, more than 90 percent of the respondents said that "one should spend only
within one's financial ability, " "one should repay borrowed money" and "one
should save before spending."</P>

      <P>The effectiveness of the first-stage human clinical trials for a Taiwan-produced
vaccine for influenza A (H1N1), which began Sept. 23, is expected to be known
from Oct. 20 onward, the vaccine developer said Friday.</P>
      <P>The results will be referred to the Department of Health (DOH) Oct. 21 for
screening after project managers at three hospitals, where the trials took place
-- National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) , the Tri-Service General Hospital
and the Taipei Medical University-Wan Fang Hospital -- met over the findings of
the trials.</P>
      <P>A total of 475 people representing all age groups were given the first shot and
have undergone subsequent testing over the past three weeks to determine the
concentration of antibodies in their blood, according  to Adimmune Corp.  --
Taiwan's only human vaccine manufacturer.</P>
      <P>Some of those who were given the first shot have also been receiving a second
shot for the second stage of the trial since Oct. 12 and are expected to return
to the hospital in three weeks to have their blood examined again, according to
Adimmune.</P>
      <P>"If over 70 percent of those tested produce antibodies, this will be considered
proof of the vaccine's effectiveness, " said Huang Li-min, a physician in NTUH's
Department of Pediatrics.</P>
      <P>Under a DOH plan, people aged under 9 will be given two shots to ensure the
effectiveness of the vaccination once an immunization program is implemented
nationwide.</P>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) warned Wednesday that a second wave of the
H1N1 outbreak is emerging in Taiwan after a previous one peaked in early
September.</P>
      <P>According to CDC Director-General Steve Kuo, the H1N1 situation has been
moderating over the past five weeks since the previous peak, although a slight
jump in the number of patients diagnosed with the new flu strain recently
signals the beginning of a second wave.</P>
      <P>Statistics released by the CECC show that the total number of H1N1 hospitalized
patients since the outbreak began had reached 367 as of late Thursday. Of the
total, 24 remained in the hospital, 319 had recovered and been discharged, and
24 others had died.</P>
      <P>Starting from November, 15 million doses of H1N1 vaccine sourced from home and
abroad will be distributed, according to the DOH plan.</P>
      <P>The vaccine will be distributed in order of priority, led by typhoon-affected
victims, medical personnel in charge of disease control and prevention, and
pregnant women.</P>
      <P>They will be followed by pre-school children, seriously ill patients,
elementary, junior and senior high school students, individuals in the 19-24 age
bracket and those over 25 at high risk of cardiopulmonary disease, healthy
people in the 25-49 age bracket, and those between 50 and 64.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is expected to see a net increase of 260,000 jobs after the establishment
of an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China, Premier Wu
Den-yih said Friday.</P>
      <P>Asked about the issue during an interpellation session in the Legislative Yuan,
Wu said the agreement will bring the greatest benefits to the petrochemical,
machinery and textile industries, creating a total of 350,000 jobs in these
sectors.</P>
      <P>This will contribute to a net increase of 260,000 jobs after deducting those
that are expected to be lost in the porcelain tile, home electrical appliance
and towel industries, which are likely to be threatened by the liberalization of
cross-strait trade, Wu said.</P>
      <P>In anticipation  of the possible negative impact from the agreement, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs has earmarked a NT$35 billion (US$1.08 billion)
fund that will used to provide assistance to more than 3,700 vulnerable
businesses, Wu said.</P>
      <P>He said the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) will also put aside funds to finance
increased unemployment benefits for workers who lose their jobs as a result of
the trade liberalization.</P>
      <P>Under the CLA's plan, these workers will be eligible to receive unemployment
payment for up to nine months -- three months longer than average workers, while
older workers and those with physical or mental disabilities will get paid for
up to one year, the premier said.</P>
      <P>He promised that the government will not further open the Taiwanese market to
Chinese agricultural products and will not allow the import of Chinese laborers.</P>
      <P>Wu stressed that the proposed ECFA will be signed under the World Trade
Organization framework to deal with the special situation between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait and will differ from a free trade  agreement,  which
requires  full reciprocity  and liberalization, he said.</P>
      <P>In promoting the signing of the ECFA,  he continued, the government will always
prioritize the interests of Taiwan and the well-being of its people and will
seek to maximize its benefits and minimize its disadvantages.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's nonprofit  Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) has recently
been selected by U.S.-based R&amp;D Magazine as a 2009 R&amp;D 100 Award
recipient for its STOBA lithium battery material.</P>
      <P>The magazine honored the new generation battery technology for its ability to
minimize the risk of internal short-circuits that lead to the common safety
concern of "thermal runaway," a process that can cause batteries to overheat and
even explode.</P>
      <P>"The system begins with a polymer devised by ITRI that is blended into the
battery. The polymer is responsible for the suppression of thermal heat, even in
the case of puncture or other catastrophic damage," the magazine said.</P>
      <P>Alex Peng, deputy director of ITRI's Material and Chemical Research Laboratories
(MCL), said in an ITRI statement that the STOBA material is the only technology
in the world that has fundamentally resolved the lithium battery safety issue.</P>
      <P>"STOBA technology has already passed mandatory shorting and piercing experiments
that are more stringent than the international safety standard," Peng said.</P>
      <P>He will lead an MCL research team to the United States to receive the global
technology award at a ceremony in Orlando, Florida, on Nov. 12.</P>
      <P>MCL Director Jonq-min Liu said in the statement that while lithium batteries are
the most important power source in today's electronic products, they remain the
most unstable of electronic components.</P>
      <P>In the past, safer lithium batteries were not required by manufacturers because
there was simply no solution to the thermal runaway problem, but the safe STOBA
material will help Taiwan's lithium battery industry stand out in the
international arena, Liu said.</P>
      <P>ITRI has applied for nine patents  related  to the STOBA technology, which not
only resolves the safety problem, but also can extend a battery's high
temperature recycling life by more than 20 percent, the ITRI statement said.</P>
      <P>The Hsinchu-based research institute was named to the R&amp;D 100 for the second
year in a row, after being honored by the magazine in 2008 for its AC-LED
technology.</P>
      <P>Other recipients of the 2009 R&amp;D 100 Awards, nicknamed by the Chicago
Tribune the "Oscars of Invention, " include many big names from the United
States, Japan, Canada and Russia, such as Intel, NASA, the U.S. Argonne National
Laboratory, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Los Alamos National
Laboratory.</P>
      <P>Aside from being honored by R&amp;D Magazine, ITRI also recently received a Wall
Street Journal Technology Innovation Award in the Consumer  Electronics
category  for  its  paper-thin  flexible loudspeaker.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Friday:</P>
      <P>UNITED DAILY NEWS:</P>
      <P>The Frankfurt Book Fair green book tag at the Chinese pavilion is</P>
      <P>unnecessary</P>
      <P>On the Taiwanese books displayed at the Chinese pavilion at the ongoing
Frankfurt Book Fair, an attached tag reads: "Content that violates the `one
China' principle will not be recognized."</P>
      <P>Such a move is unnecessary.</P>
      <P>From the perspective of thawing cross-Taiwan Strait relations, it is a positive
thing for the Chinese pavilion to display Taiwanese books. Most of the books on
display have been screened and belong in the categories of art and decoration.
Still they are marked with the "one China" tag. What a shoddy way to treat
cultural creative works.</P>
      <P>As an emerging power, China's "hard power" is being reckoned with. But its "soft
power" still has great room for improvement, especially in the fields of human
rights, democracy and freedom.</P>
      <P>The tag should be removed to allow the expression of pluralistic views, which
will show that China is open and progressive. But keeping the tag breaks any
chance of China being seen in a positive light.</P>
      <P>APPLE DAILY: A) Why aren't you angry?</P>
      <P>Citizen Congress Watch and other civic groups staged a protest in front of the
Legislative Yuan Wednesday over "runaway legislators" who claim their NT$11
million election subsidies but leave the legislature after serving for only
around one year.</P>
      <P>In the 21 months since the inauguration of the last legislature, seven ruling
Kuomintang lawmakers have left. Of the seven, only two are legislators-at-large,
while the vacancies of the remaining five will have to be filled through by-
elections, which could cost the taxpayer over NT$100 million.</P>
      <P>The absent lawmakers have had their elections invalidated because of vote-
buying, but despite this, they will not have to pay back their election
subsidies and after the by-elections,  the new lawmakers will also be paid
election subsides.</P>
      <P>With such a law and such a government, people of Taiwan, why aren't you angry?
(B) It takes two for a duet</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung tour operators have complained that business is sluggish and blame the
Kaohsiung city government for offending China by inviting the Dalai Lama to
visit and by screening a documentary on Uighur political activist Rebiya Kadeer.</P>
      <P>The tour operators say this is why China has asked tourists to shun Kaohsiung.
Their claim is only partially correct. Global tourism has been badly affected by
the global financial storm and the swine flu epidemic, as well as a spate of
natural disasters. Taiwan is no exception.</P>
      <P>This reminds us that China is by no means a country with a free economy and that
its political hand often delves into the economic realm.</P>
      <P>Beijing has not engaged in economic warfare only with Taiwan but also with the
United States, Japan and Europe. However, they are big powers, and China dares
not to be too severe toward them, contenting itself mainly with a bit of saber-
rattling.</P>
      <P>The situation with Taiwan is different, and China often uses businessmen to
pressure officials. As long as those in Taiwan are prepared to sing a duet with
Beijing, there is a high probability of China achieving its goal, which is why
Beijing is keen to employ the tactic.</P>
      <P>CHINA TIMES: Why has the DPP disappeared?</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) unveiled its first campaign ad
Thursday to highlight its message that the party offers a guarantee of good
governance.</P>
      <P>In the ad, DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen and 14 DPP candidates for year-end local
city and county chief elections are seen cleaning windows in a big cleanup
operation. The ad pitches for cleanliness, diligence and love for the land --
the same spirit espoused by the party when it was inaugurated in 1986.</P>
      <P>The DPP is hoping to raise its profile so that more people will contribute money
to the party to finance the candidates in their costly campaigns.</P>
      <P>In the past, the DPP has said that it wants to touch the hearts of the people,
but after eight years of rule under former President Chen Shui-bian, its slogan
of "the green in power will be a guarantee of good governance" has raised
questions.</P>
      <P>The DPP is anxious to rekindle awareness of the party in the eyes of the voters,
but the question is: What made the DPP disappear in the first place?</P>
      <P>If the DPP continues to condone its Taipei city councilor, Hung Chien-yi, and
his attacks on the Taipei city government with fabricated news, while staying
silent on the snowballing scandal involving the former president, the ad, even
if all DPP candidates are cleaning their windows hard, will have a difficult
time convincing voters that the party is sincere in upholding the value of
integrity.</P>
      <P>LIBERTY TIMES: Specter of police state hovering over Taiwan</P>
      <P>Taipei City Councilor Hung Chien-yi and a Formosa TV (FTV) crew recently went to
a Maokong Gondola station to film a video that they said showed the lax security
of the station.</P>
      <P>But the Taipei City government threatened to sue Hung for damaging public
property and trespassing and one FTV reporter for theft. Hung then sued Taipei
Mayor Hau Lung-pin and other city officials for aggregated libel.</P>
      <P>As the two parties exchange fire, the Taipei Prosecutors Office moved swiftly to
open an investigation. The National Communications Commission also notified FTV
that it should answer questions within five days on the production process of
the clip it filmed.</P>
      <P>The swift response of the Taipei Prosecutors Office and the National
Communications Commission is questionable.</P>
      <P>Have the two treated similar or more serious cases according to the same
criteria? Or are they stricter toward the opposition party but lax on the ruling
Koumintang?</P>
      <P>More and more people have seen the backpedaling of Taiwan's democracy, freedom
and human rights over the past year under the Ma administration.</P>
      <P>The incumbent mayor could not deal with the mess surrounding the Maokong Gondola
left behind by Ma when he was Taipei mayor, so he tried to intimidate others by
filing suit.</P>
      <P>The public should be prepared that the specter of a police state -- which Mayor
Ma's administration warned in 2004 would undermine the democratic system and
freedom of expression that have been hard won -- is still hovering around
Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government urged to improve disaster early warning network</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government should strengthen Taiwan's broadband seismic network to improve
its disaster monitoring and early warning functions, a local earth sciences
researcher suggested Friday, saying that he has discovered the network can also
be used to monitor landslides and mudflows.</P>
      <P>Lin Cheng-horng, deputy director of the Institute of Earth Sciences of Academia
Sinica, made the statement in a report on the use of the seismic network.</P>
      <P>Lin said that his analysis of the data from the seismic network during Typhoon
Morakot in early August revealed that huge landslides and debris flows could
cause seismic waves.</P>
      <P>For example, the energy released in the strong ground motion during the massive
mudslides that destroyed the village of Siaolin in Kaohisung County in August
was equivalent to that released by an earthquake measuring 4.6 on the Richter
scale, Lin said. Seismic waves from an earthquake of this magnitude can be
recorded as far away as Hokkaido in Japan, he said.</P>
      <P>According to disaster observation data, at least 45 large scale landslide and
debris flow events occurred within 24 hours after the onslaught of Typhoon
Morakot Aug. 8, Lin noted.</P>
      <P>The big difference between landslide- and earthquake-triggered ground motion
lies in the vibration frequencies, he said. The frequency of landslide-induced
ground motion would be one per 20 seconds, while that from earthquakes would be
five vibrations per second, he added.</P>
      <P>Strong ground vibrations caused by landslides or debris and mud flows could
trigger other such events, creating a chain effect capable of bringing even
worse disasters, Lin added.</P>
      <P>Lin said he learned during Typhoon Morakot that the existing monitoring system
can no longer fully provide early disaster warning because it can only monitor
landslides and floods but cannot record information on events such as the
formation of barrier lakes.</P>
      <P>He urged the government to set up a multi-functional disaster early warning
system by making good use of radar detectors and satellite equipment and
expanding the broadband seismic network.</P>

      <P>If Chinese tourists are allowed to choose freely where in Taiwan they would like
to go for sightseeing, Kaohsiung City is one the places they would pick, Premier
Wu Den-yih said Friday.</P>
      <P>The premier rejected as "inappropriate and non-representative of the full
picture" a recent statement by China's Taiwan Affairs Office of the State
Council that Chinese tourists are boycotting Kaohsiung because some interest
groups in the city are engaged with Tibet and Xinjiang separatist forces, which
jeopardizes China's interests.</P>
      <P>The office's spokeswoman Fan Liqing said earlier in the week that it is natural
for the Chinese people to show their displeasure over this situation.</P>
      <P>In response, Wu said if Chinese tourists are allowed to choose freely, Kaohsiung
would be one of their choices of fun destinations in Taiwan that are known to
have unique attractions.</P>
      <P>Intervention in the travel agencies' tour plans shows disregard for the
tourists' right to choose their travel itinerary, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will continue to uphold freedom, democracy and the law, he said.</P>
      <P>He suggested that marketing is the key to drawing more tour groups and tourists,
hinting that Kaohsiung City should embark on more aggressive  marketing in China
to introduce  its tourist attractions to the people there.</P>
      <P>Many economic and trade groups have canceled  their hotel reservations in
Kaohsiung over the past month and the number of business visitors from China to
the southern city has also dropped sharply, Tourism Bureau Director Janice Seh-
Jen Lai said.</P>
      <P>Some Kaohsiung tourism business executives attributed the drop in the number of
Chinese tourists to the city government's decision to invite Tibet's spiritual
leader the Dalai Lama to visit Taiwan to pray for Typhoon Morakot victims and to
the city's screening of a documentary on exiled Uigher activist Rebiya Kadeer.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung City government is run by the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party which has been critical of President Ma Ying-jeou's cross-strait policies.</P>

      <P>The number of centenarians in Taiwan has reached 1,223 as the life expectancy of
the country's citizens continues to increase, according to a report released
Friday by the Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>The number represents an increase of 148 persons compared with last year, when
the centenarian population topped 1,000 for the first time to hit 1,075, the
report said.</P>
      <P>The results were obtained through an annual census conducted recently in
preparation for the celebration of the Oct. 26 Double Ninth Festival that honors
senior citizens.</P>
      <P>All citizens born before Dec. 31, 1909 were counted.</P>
      <P>The report  showed that 1,135,  or 92.8 percent,  of the centenarians are
between 100 and 104 years of age, with 84 of them in the 105-109 age group, and
four at the 110-year mark or older.</P>
      <P>The average age of the centenarians -- 853 women and 370 men -- is 101.48, a
drop of 0.08 years from last year.</P>
      <P>The oldest living centenarian this year is a 116-year-old woman in Kaohsiung
City, who was the second-oldest last year. Last year the oldest was a 122-year-
old, who has since passed away.</P>
      <P>A 113-year-old man in Hualien County is the second-oldest this year, while in
third spot is 112-year-old man in Yunlin County, and in fourth place a 110-year-

      <P>A paper-thin flexible loudspeaker, dubbed FleXpeaker, developed by Taiwan's
Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) , recently won the 2009 Wall
Street Journal global Technology Innovation Award in the Consumer Electronics
category.</P>
      <P>FleXpeaker is an array of tiny, bendable speakers that can be combined to
produce high-fidelity speaker systems of almost any size using standard
printing, making it the world's thinnest, lightest and most flexible speaker.</P>
      <P>It pioneers a new era in speakers and the electronic sound industry and allows
consumer electronic products of the future to become even lighter and slimmer.</P>
      <P>In a statement released Friday, the ITRI suggested that because the FleXpeaker
is lightweight and consumes little power, it could be attractive for use in cell
phones or in car sound systems.</P>
      <P>Other possible applications include giant banners that could be used to deliver
public-service announcements in train stations or advertising messages in
shopping malls. It can also be incorporated into wearable clothing and consumer
packaging, and can be cut with scissors into any shape.</P>
      <P>"ITRI is seeking to license the technology or create a spinoff company to
commercialize the product," the ITRI statement said.</P>
      <P>Yi-jen  Chan,  general  director  of ITRI's  Electronic  &amp; Optoelectronic
Research Laboratories, who led the speaker project, traveled to San Francisco to
receive the internationally acclaimed award Oct. 13.</P>
      <P>At the award presentation ceremony, The Wall Street Journal news editor John M.
Leger praised FleXpeaker as a revolutionary technology.</P>
      <P>"The judges  believe  that this looks  like a significant breakthrough in
speaker design. They haven't seen anything like this before," Leger said.</P>
      <P>The Wall Street Journal announced that the FleXpeaker had won the global
Technology Innovation Award on Sept.  14,  beating out high-profile companies
such as HP, Livescribe and Motorola.</P>
      <P>"To be recognized by an organization as prestigious and well- respected as The
Wall Street Journal is a great honor, " Chan said. "I am very proud of our team
that developed this groundbreaking technology and am pleased they earned such
recognition."</P>
      <P>In their ninth year, the 2009 Wall Street Journal Technology Innovation  Awards
received more than 500 entries spanning 12 categories, 180 of which were sent to
a team of 16 judges from research institutes, venture capital firms, and experts
and scholars from other reputed companies and organizations.</P>
      <P>Judges were instructed to consider the technology's applications,
commercialization and market potential in addition to its innovation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Many pregnant women exposed to secondhand smoke at home: poll</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 50 percent of Taiwan's pregnant women are exposed to secondhand smoke at
home, according to the results of a survey on pregnant women released Friday.</P>
      <P>Most pregnant women exposed to secondhand smoke in Taiwan face it at home,
particularly at night, but others still must contend with secondhand smoke in
the workplace, according to the survey, the largest of its kind in 20 years.</P>
      <P>The survey, in which 2,346 pregnant women answered questionnaires and had their
blood tested periodically, was conducted by National Taiwan University Hospital
for the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH).</P>
      <P>The blood tests found that pregnant women in Taiwan lack iron, folic acid,
vitamin A and vitamin B in their diets, even in the initial stages of the their
pregnancies, and the situation gets worse as the pregnancy progresses.</P>
      <P>By the third trimester, many of the pregnant women had a 4 percent deficiency of
folic acid, a 37 percent deficiency of vitamin B, and a 14 percent deficiency of
vitamin B2. They also had major iron deficiencies, with some of the women in the
trial having iron levels 50 percent lower than accepted standards.</P>
      <P>The survey identified other flaws in the participants' diets. It found that
local pregnant women ingest only 52 percent of the daily recommended amount of
7.4 mg of Vitamin E and only half of the 522 mg of calcium recommended per day.</P>
      <P>The average amount of 4.9 c.c. of dietary fiber consumed every day by Taiwan's
pregnant females also falls short of the recommended amount by between 17
percent and 32 percent.</P>
      <P>As 60 percent of Taiwanese pregnant women also work and usually eat outside,
Shaw Ning-sing, the National Taiwan University professor who was in charge of
the survey, recommended they take fish oil and other mineral supplements to
complement the nutrients they get from their diets.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan hopes to be included in U.S. visa waiver program</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Timothy C.T. Yang said Friday that Taiwan and the United States
are discussing  the possibility of including Taiwan in a U.S. visa waiver
program, but he gave no specific timetable.</P>
      <P>Yang made the remarks in response to reporters' questions after attending an
international seminar titled "Taipei-Washington-Beijing Relations under the Ma
and Obama Administrations" that was held in Taipei by the non-government
Foundation on Asia-Pacific Peace Studies and the Pacific Forum of the Center for
Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a U.S. think tank.</P>
      <P>"Both Taiwan and the U.S. understand the importance of the visa waiver program
issue, which are already under discussion by the two sides. However, I cannot
tell you a certain timetable," Yang said.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Taiwan is concerned about U.S. President Barack Obama's visit to
China scheduled for mid-November, the foreign minister said he is confident that
Washington-Taipei relations will not be affected by the trip.</P>
      <P>With the great improvements in cross-Taiwan Strait relations, Yang said at the
international seminar, there are five facets of the new face of U.S.-Taiwan
relations in the current context.</P>
      <P>They include working on the inclusion of Taiwan in the U.S. visa waiver program,
enhancement of bilateral security cooperation, economic and investment ties, and
Taiwan's seeking of America's strong support for Taiwan's meaningful
participation in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and
International Civil Aviation Organization, according to Yang.</P>
      <P>Moreover, it would be of mutual benefit to both Taipei and Washington to expand
cooperation on issues of export control and counter-weapons  proliferation,  as
the two sides  have worked effectively together on the implementation of the
container security initiative, which entails a system of checking for illegal
goods shipping containers that leave Kaohsiung Port in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the trilateral relations between the U.S., Taiwan and China, Chao
Chun-shan, chairman of the Foundation on Asia-Pacific Peace Studies, said in his
opening remarks that this is probably the first time since 1949 that the three
parties had shared a path of mutual trust and cooperation.</P>
      <P>If such a relationship continues to develop, there might be a chance for
trilateral relations to reach a win-win-win situation, at which time Washington,
Beijing and Taipei should seize the moment.</P>
      <P>Ralph A. Cossa, president of the CSIS Pacific Forum, echoed Chao's view, saying
that there is an opportunity to move things forward because the leaderships of
all three are dedicated toward moving the relationship forward without a zero-
sum mentality.</P>
      <P>"The relations between the U.S., Taiwan and China are not and should not be a
zero-sum game, and the U.S. very much wants good relations both with China and
Taiwan," Cossa said.</P>

      <P>An even more spectacular light show and fireworks display will be staged this
year at Taipei 101 during the New Year's Eve party, the vice chairman of the
Taipei Financial Center Corp. (TFCC) that owns the tower said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wei Ying-jiao made the comment after it was reported that the Tourism Bureau,
the major sponsor of the Taipei 101 light show in the past two years, will not
be able to sponsor the show this year because it has put a lot of its financial
resources into boosting tourism business in areas hit by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Wei told reporters at an award ceremony for Taiwan's top 10 international brands
that his group is very pleased with its investment in Taipei 101 and that "the
New Year countdown party will absolutely not disappoint anyone."</P>
      <P>Noting that the fireworks countdown is an important celebration that gives
international exposure to Taiwan, Wei said that the TFCC will not only organize
the event this year but also plans to make it bigger.</P>
      <P>Asked about whether the name of his family's food and beverage business, Ting
Hsin, will be displayed at the show, Wei said that his family prefers to keep a
low-profile, therefore the show will not highlight any characters related to the
company.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CIER forecasts -3.72% GDP growth for Taiwan this year</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER) in its latest forecast
Friday slightly adjusted downward Taiwan's economic growth this year from -3.56
percent to -3.72 percent.</P>
      <P>The CIER said that the downward adjustment was made due to the "weaker-than
expected" momentum of economic recovery seen in the second and third quarters of
this year.</P>
      <P>The CIER said that Taiwan's economy recorded a negative growth of 2.08 percent
in the third quarter, but it should gain momentum to register a 5.31 growth in
the fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>Peng Su-ling, a CIER associated research fellow, attributed the optimistic
outlook for the fourth quarter in Taiwan to the gradual stabilization of the
global economic situation.</P>
      <P>The CIER painted a gloomy picture of a 5.94 percent unemployment rate for Taiwan
for the fourth quarter, and a 5.88 percent rate for the whole of 2009 based on
what it said was a reluctance on the part of domestic enterprises to hire new
workers.</P>
      <P>However, the institution said the jobless rate will drop to 5.76 percent next
year, when the economy is expected to grow by 4.65 percent.</P>
      <P>The CIER also forecast growths of 1.91 percent and 8.16 percent, respectively,
next year for Taiwan's private sector consumption and private sector investment.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's commodity and services exports will increase by 9.72 percent and
imports will grow by 8.47 percent in 2010, while the commodity price index (CPI)
will climb 0.78 percent, it forecast.</P>
      <P>However, an executive of the Citibank Taiwan said that the CIER's forecast of
4.65 percent GDP growth for next year is "too optimistic. "</P>
      <P>Cheng Chen-mao, a Citibank vice president in charge of financial trading, said
that although the global economy is beginning to show signs of recovery, "the
crisis is not completely over".</P>
      <P>He added that currently governments of the world, by implementing economic
stimulus measures, are providing the biggest momentum for economic recovery, but
whether or not the recovery would be sustained will depend in large on private
investment.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, expressing concerns over the possible impact of a proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) between Taiwan and China, Wang Lee-Rong,
director of CIER's Center for Economic Forecasting, said that Taiwan workers who
are rendered jobless by the ECFA should be transferred to those sectors that
would benefit from the cross-strait agreement.</P>
      <P>Negotiators from Taiwan and China are expected to discuss the ECFA issue when
they meet in Taichung, central Taiwan in December for the next round of cross-
strait talks, and are likely to ink the agreement some time next year.</P>

      <P>Diplomatic personnel, particularly overseas mission chiefs and staff who are on
home visits, will embark on community outreach tours to learn more about
grassroots opinions, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Friday in a
statement.</P>
      <P>According to the statement, the ministry has come up with a comprehensive action
plan in response to President Ma Ying-jeou's directive that diplomatic and
national security personnel should have closer interaction with grassroots
communities.</P>
      <P>Ma gave the directive after Typhoon Morakot wreaked havoc in southern Taiwan in
early August. At the time, diplomatic and national security authorities were
criticized for initially turning down foreign offers of relief aid for typhoon
victims.</P>
      <P>During a post-typhoon review meeting, Ma said diplomatic and national security
officials should be in more frequent contact or have greater interaction with
grassroots people so that these officials  can better represent  domestic public
opinions  and situations in the countries to which they are posted.</P>
      <P>Acting on Ma's instructions, the MOFA statement said, the ministry decided to
arrange for overseas mission chiefs and staff to visit the regions hardest-hit
by Typhoon Morakot whenever they return home on consultation visits.</P>
      <P>"Through these kinds of outreach tours, diplomatic personnel are expected to
acquire a better understanding of the local people's needs, "the statement said.</P>
      <P>Overseas mission chiefs will also be required to meet with local government
heads, particularly those in central, southern and eastern Taiwan and on
outlying islands, before they depart to take up overseas posts or when they
return on visits, in order to learn more about what kind of assistance is most
needed to promote exports of local specialties and increase civilian exchanges.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the statement said achievements in boosting bilateral trade and
economic relations will become important criteria in evaluating the overall
performance of overseas diplomatic missions.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>William Stanton, the top United States envoy to Taiwan, expressed confidence
Friday in resolving or making progress on several important issues affecting
Taiwan-U.S. relations, which he said would further enhance their already close
ties.</P>
      <P>According to Stanton, outstanding issues include resuming the long-halted Trade
Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA)  talks, working on the inclusion of Taiwan
in the U.S. visa waiver program, evaluating the provision of more security
assistance to Taiwan, supporting Taiwan's participation in international
organizations, and strengthening other areas of cooperation.</P>
      <P>"Perhaps the most important vehicle we have for the trade agenda is the TIFA.
That has been stalled over the beef issue, but it looks like it's resolved,"
Stanton said.</P>
      <P>"We are looking to resuming the TIFA talks very soon. We hope before the end of
the year to review new areas for progress on our trade agenda, " the envoy said
in his speech at an international seminar in Taipei titled "Taipei-Washington-
Beijing Relations under the Ma and Obama Administrations."</P>
      <P>The TIFA talks, which are regularly held alternatively by Taiwan and the U.S.,
have been halted because of differences over Taiwan's continued restrictions on
U.S. beef imports.</P>
      <P>Another area in which the U.S. and Taiwan are looking to expand cooperation is
law enforcement, said Stanton, who noted that the U.S. has been very encouraged
by Taiwan's efforts in combatting human trafficking.</P>
      <P>He thinks that over the long term, there is great hope that Taipei and
Washington can ink an extradition agreement, which would serve mutual interests.</P>
      <P>On the issue of including Taiwan in the U.S. visa waiver program, Stanton said
Washington wants to make travel to the U.S. more secure and convenient for
Taiwanese visitors and is encouraging Taiwan to strengthen its document security
and how it issues its passports.</P>
      <P>"We hope (to work) toward the goal of bringing Taiwan into the visa waiver
program, which I certainly think is doable. I worked on the visa waiver program,
which was a success in Korea, and I don't see why it can't be done here,"
Stanton said.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's international participation, the diplomat said Taiwan has plenty to
offer to the international community, and he noted it hopes to join the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and International Civil Aviation
Organization.</P>
      <P>"We support Taiwan's meaningful participation in these and similar
organizations, and will do what we can to help that happen, " he said.</P>
      <P>Stanton said that the U.S. very much welcomes the improving relations between
Taipei and Beijing but indicated that Taiwan needs to feel secure to continue
that progress.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan needs friends, and I can say with assurance that the U.S. will continue
to be a dependable friend of Taiwan," he said.</P>

      <P>American scholars attending a seminar on Taipei-Washington-Beijing relations
said Friday in Taipei that the United States welcomed the positive development
in relations between Taipei and Beijing and it is unlikely that Washington would
play an intermediary role.</P>
      <P>At the seminar, some 200 scholars from think tanks in the United States and
Taiwan discussed the cross-strait factor in U.S. Asia policy and the U.S. role
in building cross-strait mutual trust mechanisms. The seminar was jointly
sponsored by the Foundation on Asia-Pacific Peace Studies (FAPPS) in Taipei and
the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>Ralph A. Cossa, CSIS Pacific Forum president, said that the administration of
President Barack Obama is "absolutely delighted that China and Taiwan are
talking over and working out their problems between them."</P>
      <P>Referring to the attitude of the U.S. government towards improved relations
between Taipei and Beijing, and in response to a question by Professor George W.
Tsai of the Chinese Culture University, Cossa said that the notion that the U.S.
is worried about the two sides getting too close "is truly a minority point of
view."</P>
      <P>Cossa's view was echoed by Professor David M. Lampton of John Hopkins
University, who said that most Americans would expect the cross-strait
reconciliation to continue and would love to see the signing of a cross-strait
peace agreement.</P>
      <P>As confidence building is deemed vital to the progress of cross- strait
relations, Professor Chen I-hsin of Tamkang University said, "Washington could
play a multi-dimensional role in and after the process of cross-strait
negotiations on the establishment of mutual trust mechanisms."</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the U.S. can play the role of a facilitator by providing
Taiwan with advice and suggestions, based on its own practical experience, when
issues such as formal exchange programs, direct military-to-military exchanges
and military liaison offices are discussed in the second track meetings.</P>
      <P>Professor Bau Tzong-ho of National Taiwan University  also suggested that the
U.S. could play a more constructive role as a counterbalance, partner and
deterrent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Techniques to build Wang Yeh's boat may soon disappear</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 16 (CNA)
10/16/09  21:10:22
(By Kuo Chi-hsuan &amp; Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As the eight-day Donggang Wang Yeh Festival heads toward its climax Saturday
when a multimillion Taiwan dollar boat is burned, a shipbuilding master worries
that one day soon the art of building the deity's wooden vessel will be lost.</P>
      <P>Young people today are not interested in learning how to put together the
ceremonial boat, lamented 65-year-old Hsieh Chung-sheng while walking on a beach
at Jhenhai Park to inspect the site where the highly anticipated triennial
ritual of burning Wang Yeh's boat takes place.</P>
      <P>The master craftsman said he began learning the skills needed to build wooden
fishing boats when he was 16 and he was in his twenties when he was recruited by
Donggang Township's Donglong Temple -- the center of Wang Yeh worship in
southwestern Taiwan -- to work on the Wang Yeh vessel.</P>
      <P>At the age of 48, he was promoted to head a team of more than 160 workers to
make the craft that carries Wang Yeh on his pilmigrage around the town to help
those who worship him eradicate disease and ward off evil.</P>
      <P>As wooden fishing vessels have gradually been replaced by modern boats made of
carbon fiber, the number of wooden boat craftsmen has also declined. Now there
are only 100 members on his team, and they average 60 years old.</P>
      <P>"We are a group of retired old men, " Hsieh says, and he is worried that a
tradition that dates back more than 300 years, when Donglong Temple organized
its first triennial Wang Yeh worshipping ceremony, could be without its main
prop.</P>
      <P>Wang Yeh's vessel, however, has not always been built completely with wood. In
the early days, the ceremonial boat had a bamboo frame and paper body. It was
not until 1973 that local residents had enough money to build a real boat, Hsieh
recalls.</P>
      <P>Wang Yeh's boat is actually modeled after an imperial boat in ancient China that
was prevalent in the Fujian and Shantou areas.</P>
      <P>"It wasn't as big as the one we build now, " Hsieh says, explaining that the
boat's size in the first festival in Taiwan was about 11.4 meters by 1.7 meters
and has expanded each time the ceremony has been held -- until 2009.</P>
      <P>Wang Yeh's boat this year measures the same size it did in 2006 -- 13.8m long by
3.65m wide by 1.75m high -- because if it were made any bigger, it could not be
carried through the streets of Donggang.</P>
      <P>But its price tag of NT$6.6 million this year was about 10 percent higher than
three years ago because of more expensive raw materials, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>On Friday, the colorful boat made of high quality Vietnamese juniper was pulled

    <HEADLINE>Acer heads list of top 10 Taiwan Global Brands in 2009</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Computer vendor Acer Inc. was unveiled Friday as Taiwan's leading brand on a
list of Taiwan's Top 10 Global Brands for the first time ever, with anti-virus
software maker Trend Micro and computer maker AsusTek close behind.</P>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew handed out awards to all of the companies on the top
10 list at Friday's awards ceremony, a component of the government's Branding
Taiwan program created in 2003 aimed at building globally popular brands.</P>
      <P>Acer headed the top 10 list with an estimated brand value of US$1.24 billion,
thanks to its mergers with Gateway and Packard Bell in 2007 and its successful
launch of netbook computers, according to officials from the event's co-sponsor,
the semi-official Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA).</P>
      <P>Acer is Taiwan's largest vendor of laptop computers, and the world's second
largest computer vendor after surpassing Dell in the third quarter of 2009.</P>
      <P>Its product lineup includes desktops, laptops, personal digital assistants
(PDAs), servers and storage, displays, peripherals, and e-business services for
business, government, education, and home users.</P>
      <P>Filling out the top 10 brand list were, in order, HTC, Master Kong, Want Want,
Maxxis, Giant, Synnex and Zyxel.</P>
      <P>Master Kong and Giant have made it into the top 10 every year since the list was
created, even though it has been traditionally dominated by high-tech companies.
Over the past seven years, Trend Micro has occupied the No. 1 spot five times.</P>
      <P>But the continued presence of conventional businesses such as food processor
Master Kong and bicycle maker Giant, along with rice snack maker Want Want was
worth noting, according to global brand consultancy Interbrand.</P>
      <P>The brand expert attributed  Master Kong's listing to its prevailing market
share in the Chinese market, which has spared the company from the adverse
effects of the global economic crunch and helped its brand value appreciate by
19 percent in 2009 to US$916 million.</P>
      <P>Want Want, which made the list for the first time, was estimated to have a brand
value of US$421 million, while Giant had a brand value of US$262 million.</P>
      <P>The combined value of this year's top 10 Taiwanese brands totaled US$7.326
billion, down 2.8 percent from 2008 due to the impact of the global financial
crisis, TAITRA officials said. Each of the top four brands had brand values
exceeding US$1.2 billion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Gov't plans to provide NT$1b to promote creative industries</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) plans to subsidize NT$1 billion in
discounts on student tickets for performances by local arts and cultural groups
to help foster cultural and creative industries, a council official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Fang Jy-Shiuh, director of the council's first department, said the government
hoped the trial program would expand the demand for arts and cultural events.</P>
      <P>A plan to offer tax incentives to encourage cultural consumption had originally
been considered but was eventually scrapped after taking into account other
potential consequences.</P>
      <P>The government therefore decided to provide NT$1 billion a year for the subsidy
program on a trial basis, Fang said in announcing the program at a seminar on
the development of Taiwan's cultural and creative industries organized by the
Taiwan Competitiveness Forum.</P>
      <P>Noting that the subsidy program falls under the provisions of the Cultural and
Creative Industry Development Draft Act, Fang said that although the act has yet
to be enacted, the CCA has begun mapping out the subsidy plan.</P>
      <P>Fang also said that one of the CCA's main objectives is to help creative
industries penetrate Chinese-speaking and international markets.</P>
      <P>In the initial stage, the two sides can start by jointly holding large scale
cultural and creative expositions and establishing a dialogue mechanism, she
suggested.</P>
      <P>She added that the CCA will work to promote industry cooperation between Taiwan
and China in the areas of investment protection, intellectual property rights
protection and joint ventures into international markets.</P>
      <P>The cultural and creative industries  of Taiwan and China complement each other,
Fang contended, citing China's huge market, abundant capital, vast land and a
sound cultural policy related to creative industries,  and Taiwan's strong
talent pool and its favorable and free environment to support the industry's
development.</P>
      <P>Kuo Su-chen, chief of a creative belly dance troupe and winner of the ninth
Ahlan Wa Sahlan Belly Dance Festival in July 2008 in Egypt, said at the seminar
that she believes the subsidy program will help expand arts and cultural
consumption.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that if performing groups are not famous enough, they usually find it
difficult to sell tickets to their shows. She also suggested  that the CCA
should first provide a platform  for performances to help boost performing
groups' popularity.</P>
      <P>Huang  Ching-lung,  president  of Want Daily,  one of the Taiwan-based China
Times Group's publications, said no industry can afford to neglect the massive
Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Huang cited the contrasting experiences of two singers, Taiwan's top female
Hoklo singer Chiang Huei and Hong Kong Jacky Cheung.</P>
      <P>Both singers sold 1 million copies of their hit albums in their home markets,
but Cheung's "Kiss Goodbye" sold 5 million copies in Chinese communities around
the world, while Chiang failed to sell her album outside Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's cultural and creative industries encompass the visual arts, music and
performing arts, cultural exhibitions and performance facilities, films, TV and
broadcasting, publishing, advertising, and product design.</P>
      <P>They also extend to fashion and architectural design, creative living, digital
leisure and amusement industries, according to the definition by the center for
promoting Taiwan's cultural and creative industries under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Progress in cross-strait ties expected ahead: U.S. academic</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct.16 (CNA)
10/16/09  22:26:18
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot and other extraneous factors have combined to frustrate progress
in relations across the Taiwan Strait recently but have not stifled positive
momentum, and progress in cross-strait ties is expected to resume in the coming
quarter, a U.S. scholar forecast in a recent report.</P>
      <P>The online quarterly report, titled China-Taiwan Relations: Temporarily in the
Doldrums, was authored by David G. Brown, a cross-strait affairs expert at the
Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.</P>
      <P>According to Brown, it is largely extraneous developments, rather than policy
changes, that have impeded progress in cross-strait ties in the July-September
quarter.</P>
      <P>"Typhoon Morakot consumed public and government attention on Taiwan for three
weeks in August and then led to Cabinet changes affecting some of the senior
officials handling cross-Strait economic issues," Brown wrote.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Morakot occasioned two positive developments, Brown argued.
First, Beijing was prompt and generous in providing financial and practical aid.
Second, the U.S. also provided aid, which included the first deployment of U.S.
military aircraft to Taiwan since 1979.</P>
      <P>"This potentially sensitive action was handled discreetly, with Beijing
portraying it as a humanitarian action, the U.S. planes leaving as soon as their
humanitarian work was concluded, and neither Taipei nor Washington gave the
action any broader significance, " Brown wrote.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu's decision to invite the Dalai Lama to console Morakot
victims presented a dilemma for Taiwan's President Ma Ying-jeou and for Beijing.</P>
      <P>"In the end, both sides handled the issue in a way that delayed some minor
cross-Strait events but did not significantly disrupt relations," Brown
observed.</P>
      <P>He predicted that progress in improving cross-strait relations should resume in
the coming months.</P>
      <P>Brown suggested, however, that the easy agreements were concluded in the first
three meetings between top officials of Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) and Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>More difficult issues involving the usual balancing of interests in bilateral
trade negotiations have affected the pace of talks on both the memorandums of
understanding (MOUs) covering banking, insurance and securities and the proposed
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA), Brown contended.</P>
      <P>The financial MOUs, which were to have been completed in late June, are still
pending. The financial regulatory systems to be defined in the MOUs must be in
place before the two sides can reciprocally approve operations by financial
services firms.</P>
      <P>The MOUs are expected to be signed before the end of the year, Brown said,
citing China's Taiwan Affairs Office.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Brown pointed out that the fourth round of SEF-ARATS talks is
scheduled to be held late this year and should result in additional  agreements,
possibly including  ones on fisheries, agricultural product standards, product
testing, double taxation and a discussion on ECFA.</P>
      <P>On cross-strait economic ties, Brown said bilateral trade is beginning to
recover from the precipitous decline caused by the global financial crisis and
the first group of Chinese investments in Taiwan, although small, have been
approved.</P>
      <P>Citing tallies compiled by Taiwan's Investment Commission, the report said eight
Chinese investments totaling US$769,000 were made during July and August with
Fujia Newland Computers making the largest single investment.</P>
      <P>With cross-strait relations proceeding constructively, the U.S. government's
role is limited. Nevertheless, Brown said arms sales are one important exception
that needs to be handled in a sophisticated way to support the long-term U.S.
interest in a peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>"It is in the U.S. interest to support a government in Taiwan that is working
constructively to consolidate a stable, peaceful cross-strait relationship,"
Brown argued.</P>
      <P>Taipei is requesting arms so it can maintain a "credible deterrent position"
from which to negotiate.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, as the Ma administration is being criticized at home for not doing
enough for Taiwan's defense, Brown wrote, the fact that there has been little
concrete evidence of support for Taipei from the Obama administration is calling
into question Ma's ability to successfully manage the all important U.S.-Taiwan
relationship.</P>
      <P>"With Beijing's deployments growing, there is a sound case for the U.S. to move
ahead with the Blackhawk sale and to respond favorably to Taiwan's request for
the F-16C/D aircraft, which are increasingly seen as a litmus test of U.S.
support," Brown wrote.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Continuity in store for future U.S.-Taiwan-China relations: Paal</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16 (CNA)
10/16/09  22:46:00
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Douglas Paal, former director of the American Institute in Taiwan, said Friday
in Taipei that "continuity" will characterize prospects for the short-term
strategic paths of the United States, Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>The proposition was reinforced by last year's election of a Taiwan
administration that seeks to eschew unnecessary friction with China and seek
areas of cooperation with Beijing, according to Paal.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan has at least two and a half years to seek success with its
approach, and Beijing still appears willing to cooperate, though always with a
wary eye to the downside risks.</P>
      <P>Paal, who is now vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, said at the seminar titled Taipei- Washington-Beijing
Relations under the Ma and Obama Administratopms" that both China and the U.S.
are also likely to continue their current tactics.</P>
      <P>He said China's direction, economically and otherwise, appears to enjoy what
passes for a consensus on the mainland, while the U.S., under the new Obama
administration, is actively seeking to accentuate the positive with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Obama has indentified the financial crisis, climate change, and non-
proliferation as his key themes and has been seeking and initially obtaining
Chinese cooperation in these areas, he added.</P>
      <P>Paal also argued that Obama would undoubtedly like to see Taiwan shoulder an
appropriate share of the burden of its own necessary defense.</P>
      <P>"Indications are that his (Obama's) administration will assess Taiwan's requests
with an eye to the actual situation rather than just the statements of China's
leaders," Paal said.</P>
      <P>"The friction that could result should be manageable within the broader positive
context in U.S.-China relations, and in Taiwan's own efforts to avoid clumsily
treading on sensitivities and to seek common interests," he added.</P>
      <P>In the long term, Paal said whether the U.S., Taiwan, and China will change
their strategic courses will depend on three factors that include the ability of
the Ma Ying-jeou administration to demonstrate to Taiwan's voters that his
policies are worth continuing.</P>
      <P>The other two factors are China's avoidance of a domestic crisis, driven by
factors such as a financial collapse, a failure to stimulate domestic
consumption, or an embarrassing international setback; and America's
readjustment of its economic trajectory from a capital importing to a capital
exporting country, the downsizing of its international exposure to conflict, and
fiscal responsibility, he added.</P>
      <P>"These are significant threats, if now remote, to the positive sum game the
triangular relationship has entered. The emergence of a significant change in
any one of them will have a negative impact on the other two," Paal said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Economic crisis hurts Taiwan worse than South Korea: scholars</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The current global economic crisis has inflicted greater harm on Taiwan than
South Korea, scholars at a Taipei forum said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to a forecast by the Manila-based Asian Development Bank (ADB) in late
September, Taiwan's economy is expected to contract 4.9 percent this year,
compared to South Korea's 2 percent.</P>
      <P>Chou Chi, director of the Economics Department of the Shih Hsin University, said
that Taiwan outperformed South Korea in coping with the 1997 Asian financial
crisis, but since then South Korea has adopted an economic development approach
that has differed from Taiwan's and yielded a relatively satisfactory result.</P>
      <P>For example, Taiwan's average real wage (salary) has remained relatively
unchanged over the past 10 years and now accounts for only 60 percent of that of
South Korea, in part because of the latter's rising productivity.</P>
      <P>Echoing Chou, Hu Chung Ying, the vice chairman of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development, argued that Taiwan has put too much emphasis on the
development of export-oriented  high-tech industries, in sharp contrast to South
Korea's more diverse policy of pushing shipbuilding, transportation, the
automotive sector and high-tech industries as its development priorities.</P>
      <P>Hu urged the government to seek to break the "bottleneck" by accelerating the
development of the service sector over the next 10 years.</P>
      <P>You Chi-tsung, the deputy director of the Industrial Technology Research
Institute's Industrial Economics and Knowledge Center, attributed Taiwan's
lackluster performance to its relatively poor ability to create high value-added
goods.</P>
      <P>The decline in Taiwan's value-added rate from 27.8 percent in 1999 to 18.46
percent in 2008 stemmed in part from its industrial structure that was not
geared to increasing incomes and the quality of life.</P>

      <P>Grilled on the difficulties Taiwanese gold medalists at international sports
competitions are having finding jobs, Premier Wu Den-yih said Friday that the
central government had an obligation to secure jobs for athletes placing in the
top three of major sports events.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang Legislator Huang Chih-hsiung, a silver medalist in taekwondo at the
2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, raised the issue at a Legislative Yuan hearing
Friday.</P>
      <P>He said that in view of the problems faced by Taiwanese medal winners  at this
summer's  Kaohsiung  World Games  and Taipei Deaflympics, the government should
help outstanding athletes find ways to make a living.</P>
      <P>Wu said he will direct the Cabinet-level Sports Affairs Council to come up with
a plan to arrange for award-winning athletes in the recently concluded
competitions to serve as coaches in table tennis, swimming, baseball and other
relevant sports.</P>
      <P>Major state-owned enterprises are also willing to financially support local
baseball and basketball teams to hire medal-winning athletes to be their
coaches, Wu said.</P>
      <P>He also promised that the Executive Yuan would collaborate with local
governments in helping outstanding athletes find jobs.</P>
      <P>During the session, Huang also expressed concern that local students exercise
too and eat too much.</P>
      <P>Minister of Education Wu Ching-chi said his ministry has launched a "health
campus" campaign to encourage  students to exercise regularly and adequately
while adopting a balanced diet.</P>
      <P>"We will encourage local governments to suggest public schools in their
districts to provide full vegetarian lunches once a week for their students," Wu
said.</P>

      <P>Chairman Chiang Pin-kung of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Friday
that his Chinese counterpart, Chen Yunlin. is not scheduled to meet President Ma
Ying-jeou when he visits Taiwan for the coming round of talks in December.</P>
      <P>Chen, president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS), paid a brief and awkward courtesy call to Ma at the Taipei Guest House
last November, when he was in Taipei for the second round of cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>Chiang did not specify a reason why Chen and Ma will not meet.</P>
      <P>Both SEF and ARATS are authorized  by Taiwan  and China, respectively, to handle
cross-strait exchanges in the absence of formal contacts between the two sides.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou confirmed Friday that a controversial economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) will not be on the agenda of the fourth
round of talks.</P>
      <P>The topics of discussion will be cooperation on fishermen, agricultural
quarantine inspection, industrial product standards, inspection and
certification, and the avoidance of double taxation, Ma said.</P>
      <P>In a meeting with American scholars in Taiwan for a seminar on Taipei-Beijing-
Washington  relations,  Ma  reiterated  that  the government will secure the
country's sovereignty and interests while seeking to improve relations with
China.</P>
      <P>Ma said that over the past year or so, the government has made great efforts to
reduce hostility between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait with satisfactory
results, including nine agreements signed in the past three rounds of talks
between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Those pacts have made possible the establishment of air, trade and postal links
between Taiwan and China, visits to Taiwan by Chinese tourists, and cross-strait
judicial assistance.</P>
      <P>Defending his new diplomatic approach that seeks to avoid competition with China
over diplomatic allies, Ma said that a climate of reconciliation has been made
possible not only in the Taiwan Strait but also in the international arena.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was able to be represented by a retired high-ranking official at last
year's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit meeting, and to take part
in this year's World Health Assembly (WHA).</P>
      <P>On the nation's future diplomatic operation agenda, Ma told the visiting
scholars that the government will seek to take part in such international
agencies that are deeply related to the safety of the nation and people but have
no political significance, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the International Civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO).</P>

      <P>The Nepal group stayed there for over two weeks, the longest stay of any group.

      <P>A paper-thin flexible loudspeaker, dubbed FleXpeaker, developed by Taiwan's
Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) , recently won the 2009 Wall
Street Journal global Technology Innovation Award in the Consumer Electronics
category.</P>
      <P>FleXpeaker is an array of tiny, bendable speakers that can be combined to
produce high-fidelity speaker systems of almost any size using standard
printing, making it the world's thinnest, lightest and most flexible speaker.</P>
      <P>It pioneers a new era in speakers and the electronic sound industry and allows
consumer electronic products of the future to become even lighter and slimmer.</P>
      <P>In a statement released Friday, the ITRI suggested that because the FleXpeaker
is lightweight and consumes little power, it could be attractive for use in cell
phones or in car sound systems.</P>
      <P>Other possible applications include giant banners that could be used to deliver
public-service announcements in train stations or advertising messages in
shopping malls. It can also be incorporated into wearable clothing and consumer
packaging, and can be cut with scissors into any shape.</P>
      <P>"ITRI is seeking to license the technology or create a spinoff company to
commercialize the product," the ITRI statement said.</P>
      <P>Yi-jen  Chan,  general  director  of ITRI's  Electronic  &amp; Optoelectronic
Research Laboratories, who led the speaker project, traveled to San Francisco to
receive the internationally acclaimed award Oct. 13.</P>
      <P>At the award presentation ceremony, The Wall Street Journal news editor John M.
Leger praised FleXpeaker as a revolutionary technology.</P>
      <P>"The judges  believe  that this looks  like a significant breakthrough in
speaker design. They haven't seen anything like this before," Leger said.</P>
      <P>The Wall Street Journal announced that the FleXpeaker had won the global
Technology Innovation Award on Sept.  14,  beating out high-profile companies
such as HP, Livescribe and Motorola.</P>
      <P>"To be recognized by an organization as prestigious and well- respected as The
Wall Street Journal is a great honor, " Chan said. "I am very proud of our team
that developed this groundbreaking technology and am pleased they earned such
recognition."</P>
      <P>In their ninth year, the 2009 Wall Street Journal Technology Innovation  Awards
received more than 500 entries spanning 12 categories, 180 of which were sent to
a team of 16 judges from research institutes, venture capital firms, and experts
and scholars from other reputed companies and organizations.</P>
      <P>Judges were instructed to consider the technology's applications,
commercialization and market potential in addition to its innovation.</P>

      <P>Some 50 percent of Taiwan's pregnant women are exposed to secondhand smoke at
home, according to the results of a survey on pregnant women released Friday.</P>
      <P>Most pregnant women exposed to secondhand smoke in Taiwan face it at home,
particularly at night, but others still must contend with secondhand smoke in
the workplace, according to the survey, the largest of its kind in 20 years.</P>
      <P>The survey, in which 2,346 pregnant women answered questionnaires and had their
blood tested periodically, was conducted by National Taiwan University Hospital
for the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH).</P>
      <P>The blood tests found that pregnant women in Taiwan lack iron, folic acid,
vitamin A and vitamin B in their diets, even in the initial stages of the their
pregnancies, and the situation gets worse as the pregnancy progresses.</P>
      <P>By the third trimester, many of the pregnant women had a 4 percent deficiency of
folic acid, a 37 percent deficiency of vitamin B, and a 14 percent deficiency of
vitamin B2. They also had major iron deficiencies, with some of the women in the
trial having iron levels 50 percent lower than accepted standards.</P>
      <P>The survey identified other flaws in the participants' diets. It found that
local pregnant women ingest only 52 percent of the daily recommended amount of
7.4 mg of Vitamin E and only half of the 522 mg of calcium recommended per day.</P>
      <P>The average amount of 4.9 c.c. of dietary fiber consumed every day by Taiwan's
pregnant females also falls short of the recommended amount by between 17
percent and 32 percent.</P>
      <P>As 60 percent of Taiwanese pregnant women also work and usually eat outside,
Shaw Ning-sing, the National Taiwan University professor who was in charge of
the survey, recommended they take fish oil and other mineral supplements to
complement the nutrients they get from their diets.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan hopes to be included in U.S. visa waiver program</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Timothy C.T. Yang said Friday that Taiwan and the United States
are discussing  the possibility of including Taiwan in a U.S. visa waiver
program, but he gave no specific timetable.</P>
      <P>Yang made the remarks in response to reporters' questions after attending an
international seminar titled "Taipei-Washington-Beijing Relations under the Ma
and Obama Administrations" that was held in Taipei by the non-government
Foundation on Asia-Pacific Peace Studies and the Pacific Forum of the Center for
Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a U.S. think tank.</P>
      <P>"Both Taiwan and the U.S. understand the importance of the visa waiver program
issue, which are already under discussion by the two sides. However, I cannot
tell you a certain timetable," Yang said.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Taiwan is concerned about U.S. President Barack Obama's visit to
China scheduled for mid-November, the foreign minister said he is confident that
Washington-Taipei relations will not be affected by the trip.</P>
      <P>With the great improvements in cross-Taiwan Strait relations, Yang said at the
international seminar, there are five facets of the new face of U.S.-Taiwan
relations in the current context.</P>
      <P>They include working on the inclusion of Taiwan in the U.S. visa waiver program,
enhancement of bilateral security cooperation, economic and investment ties, and
Taiwan's seeking of America's strong support for Taiwan's meaningful
participation in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and
International Civil Aviation Organization, according to Yang.</P>
      <P>Moreover, it would be of mutual benefit to both Taipei and Washington to expand
cooperation on issues of export control and counter-weapons  proliferation,  as
the two sides  have worked effectively together on the implementation of the
container security initiative, which entails a system of checking for illegal
goods shipping containers that leave Kaohsiung Port in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the trilateral relations between the U.S., Taiwan and China, Chao
Chun-shan, chairman of the Foundation on Asia-Pacific Peace Studies, said in his
opening remarks that this is probably the first time since 1949 that the three
parties had shared a path of mutual trust and cooperation.</P>
      <P>If such a relationship continues to develop, there might be a chance for
trilateral relations to reach a win-win-win situation, at which time Washington,
Beijing and Taipei should seize the moment.</P>
      <P>Ralph A. Cossa, president of the CSIS Pacific Forum, echoed Chao's view, saying
that there is an opportunity to move things forward because the leaderships of
all three are dedicated toward moving the relationship forward without a zero-
sum mentality.</P>
      <P>"The relations between the U.S., Taiwan and China are not and should not be a
zero-sum game, and the U.S. very much wants good relations both with China and
Taiwan," Cossa said.</P>

      <P>An even more spectacular light show and fireworks display will be staged this
year at Taipei 101 during the New Year's Eve party, the vice chairman of the
Taipei Financial Center Corp. (TFCC) that owns the tower said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wei Ying-jiao made the comment after it was reported that the Tourism Bureau,
the major sponsor of the Taipei 101 light show in the past two years, will not
be able to sponsor the show this year because it has put a lot of its financial
resources into boosting tourism business in areas hit by Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Wei told reporters at an award ceremony for Taiwan's top 10 international brands
that his group is very pleased with its investment in Taipei 101 and that "the
New Year countdown party will absolutely not disappoint anyone."</P>
      <P>Noting that the fireworks countdown is an important celebration that gives
international exposure to Taiwan, Wei said that the TFCC will not only organize
the event this year but also plans to make it bigger.</P>
      <P>Asked about whether the name of his family's food and beverage business, Ting
Hsin, will be displayed at the show, Wei said that his family prefers to keep a
low-profile, therefore the show will not highlight any characters related to the
company.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CIER forecasts -3.72% GDP growth for Taiwan this year</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER) in its latest forecast
Friday slightly adjusted downward Taiwan's economic growth this year from -3.56
percent to -3.72 percent.</P>
      <P>The CIER said that the downward adjustment was made due to the "weaker-than
expected" momentum of economic recovery seen in the second and third quarters of
this year.</P>
      <P>The CIER said that Taiwan's economy recorded a negative growth of 2.08 percent
in the third quarter, but it should gain momentum to register a 5.31 growth in
the fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>Peng Su-ling, a CIER associated research fellow, attributed the optimistic
outlook for the fourth quarter in Taiwan to the gradual stabilization of the
global economic situation.</P>
      <P>The CIER painted a gloomy picture of a 5.94 percent unemployment rate for Taiwan
for the fourth quarter, and a 5.88 percent rate for the whole of 2009 based on
what it said was a reluctance on the part of domestic enterprises to hire new
workers.</P>
      <P>However, the institution said the jobless rate will drop to 5.76 percent next
year, when the economy is expected to grow by 4.65 percent.</P>
      <P>The CIER also forecast growths of 1.91 percent and 8.16 percent, respectively,
next year for Taiwan's private sector consumption and private sector investment.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's commodity and services exports will increase by 9.72 percent and
imports will grow by 8.47 percent in 2010, while the commodity price index (CPI)
will climb 0.78 percent, it forecast.</P>
      <P>However, an executive of the Citibank Taiwan said that the CIER's forecast of
4.65 percent GDP growth for next year is "too optimistic. "</P>
      <P>Cheng Chen-mao, a Citibank vice president in charge of financial trading, said
that although the global economy is beginning to show signs of recovery, "the
crisis is not completely over".</P>
      <P>He added that currently governments of the world, by implementing economic
stimulus measures, are providing the biggest momentum for economic recovery, but
whether or not the recovery would be sustained will depend in large on private
investment.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, expressing concerns over the possible impact of a proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) between Taiwan and China, Wang Lee-Rong,
director of CIER's Center for Economic Forecasting, said that Taiwan workers who
are rendered jobless by the ECFA should be transferred to those sectors that
would benefit from the cross-strait agreement.</P>
      <P>Negotiators from Taiwan and China are expected to discuss the ECFA issue when
they meet in Taichung, central Taiwan in December for the next round of cross-
strait talks, and are likely to ink the agreement some time next year.</P>

      <P>Diplomatic personnel, particularly overseas mission chiefs and staff who are on
home visits, will embark on community outreach tours to learn more about
grassroots opinions, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Friday in a
statement.</P>
      <P>According to the statement, the ministry has come up with a comprehensive action
plan in response to President Ma Ying-jeou's directive that diplomatic and
national security personnel should have closer interaction with grassroots
communities.</P>
      <P>Ma gave the directive after Typhoon Morakot wreaked havoc in southern Taiwan in
early August. At the time, diplomatic and national security authorities were
criticized for initially turning down foreign offers of relief aid for typhoon
victims.</P>
      <P>During a post-typhoon review meeting, Ma said diplomatic and national security
officials should be in more frequent contact or have greater interaction with
grassroots people so that these officials  can better represent  domestic public
opinions  and situations in the countries to which they are posted.</P>
      <P>Acting on Ma's instructions, the MOFA statement said, the ministry decided to
arrange for overseas mission chiefs and staff to visit the regions hardest-hit
by Typhoon Morakot whenever they return home on consultation visits.</P>
      <P>"Through these kinds of outreach tours, diplomatic personnel are expected to
acquire a better understanding of the local people's needs, "the statement said.</P>
      <P>Overseas mission chiefs will also be required to meet with local government
heads, particularly those in central, southern and eastern Taiwan and on
outlying islands, before they depart to take up overseas posts or when they
return on visits, in order to learn more about what kind of assistance is most
needed to promote exports of local specialties and increase civilian exchanges.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the statement said achievements in boosting bilateral trade and
economic relations will become important criteria in evaluating the overall
performance of overseas diplomatic missions.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>William Stanton, the top United States envoy to Taiwan, expressed confidence
Friday in resolving or making progress on several important issues affecting
Taiwan-U.S. relations, which he said would further enhance their already close
ties.</P>
      <P>According to Stanton, outstanding issues include resuming the long-halted Trade
Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA)  talks, working on the inclusion of Taiwan
in the U.S. visa waiver program, evaluating the provision of more security
assistance to Taiwan, supporting Taiwan's participation in international
organizations, and strengthening other areas of cooperation.</P>
      <P>"Perhaps the most important vehicle we have for the trade agenda is the TIFA.
That has been stalled over the beef issue, but it looks like it's resolved,"
Stanton said.</P>
      <P>"We are looking to resuming the TIFA talks very soon. We hope before the end of
the year to review new areas for progress on our trade agenda, " the envoy said
in his speech at an international seminar in Taipei titled "Taipei-Washington-
Beijing Relations under the Ma and Obama Administrations."</P>
      <P>The TIFA talks, which are regularly held alternatively by Taiwan and the U.S.,
have been halted because of differences over Taiwan's continued restrictions on
U.S. beef imports.</P>
      <P>Another area in which the U.S. and Taiwan are looking to expand cooperation is
law enforcement, said Stanton, who noted that the U.S. has been very encouraged
by Taiwan's efforts in combatting human trafficking.</P>
      <P>He thinks that over the long term, there is great hope that Taipei and
Washington can ink an extradition agreement, which would serve mutual interests.</P>
      <P>On the issue of including Taiwan in the U.S. visa waiver program, Stanton said
Washington wants to make travel to the U.S. more secure and convenient for
Taiwanese visitors and is encouraging Taiwan to strengthen its document security
and how it issues its passports.</P>
      <P>"We hope (to work) toward the goal of bringing Taiwan into the visa waiver
program, which I certainly think is doable. I worked on the visa waiver program,
which was a success in Korea, and I don't see why it can't be done here,"
Stanton said.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's international participation, the diplomat said Taiwan has plenty to
offer to the international community, and he noted it hopes to join the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and International Civil Aviation
Organization.</P>
      <P>"We support Taiwan's meaningful participation in these and similar
organizations, and will do what we can to help that happen, " he said.</P>
      <P>Stanton said that the U.S. very much welcomes the improving relations between
Taipei and Beijing but indicated that Taiwan needs to feel secure to continue
that progress.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan needs friends, and I can say with assurance that the U.S. will continue
to be a dependable friend of Taiwan," he said.</P>

      <P>American scholars attending a seminar on Taipei-Washington-Beijing relations
said Friday in Taipei that the United States welcomed the positive development
in relations between Taipei and Beijing and it is unlikely that Washington would
play an intermediary role.</P>
      <P>At the seminar, some 200 scholars from think tanks in the United States and
Taiwan discussed the cross-strait factor in U.S. Asia policy and the U.S. role
in building cross-strait mutual trust mechanisms. The seminar was jointly
sponsored by the Foundation on Asia-Pacific Peace Studies (FAPPS) in Taipei and
the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>Ralph A. Cossa, CSIS Pacific Forum president, said that the administration of
President Barack Obama is "absolutely delighted that China and Taiwan are
talking over and working out their problems between them."</P>
      <P>Referring to the attitude of the U.S. government towards improved relations
between Taipei and Beijing, and in response to a question by Professor George W.
Tsai of the Chinese Culture University, Cossa said that the notion that the U.S.
is worried about the two sides getting too close "is truly a minority point of
view."</P>
      <P>Cossa's view was echoed by Professor David M. Lampton of John Hopkins
University, who said that most Americans would expect the cross-strait
reconciliation to continue and would love to see the signing of a cross-strait
peace agreement.</P>
      <P>As confidence building is deemed vital to the progress of cross- strait
relations, Professor Chen I-hsin of Tamkang University said, "Washington could
play a multi-dimensional role in and after the process of cross-strait
negotiations on the establishment of mutual trust mechanisms."</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the U.S. can play the role of a facilitator by providing
Taiwan with advice and suggestions, based on its own practical experience, when
issues such as formal exchange programs, direct military-to-military exchanges
and military liaison offices are discussed in the second track meetings.</P>
      <P>Professor Bau Tzong-ho of National Taiwan University  also suggested that the
U.S. could play a more constructive role as a counterbalance, partner and
deterrent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Techniques to build Wang Yeh's boat may soon disappear</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 16 (CNA)
10/16/09  21:10:22

    <TEXT>
      <P>As the eight-day Donggang Wang Yeh Festival heads toward its climax Saturday
when a multimillion Taiwan dollar boat is burned, a shipbuilding master worries
that one day soon the art of building the deity's wooden vessel will be lost.</P>
      <P>Young people today are not interested in learning how to put together the
ceremonial boat, lamented 65-year-old Hsieh Chung-sheng while walking on a beach
at Jhenhai Park to inspect the site where the highly anticipated triennial
ritual of burning Wang Yeh's boat takes place.</P>
      <P>The master craftsman said he began learning the skills needed to build wooden
fishing boats when he was 16 and he was in his twenties when he was recruited by
Donggang Township's Donglong Temple -- the center of Wang Yeh worship in
southwestern Taiwan -- to work on the Wang Yeh vessel.</P>
      <P>At the age of 48, he was promoted to head a team of more than 160 workers to
make the craft that carries Wang Yeh on his pilmigrage around the town to help
those who worship him eradicate disease and ward off evil.</P>
      <P>As wooden fishing vessels have gradually been replaced by modern boats made of
carbon fiber, the number of wooden boat craftsmen has also declined. Now there
are only 100 members on his team, and they average 60 years old.</P>
      <P>"We are a group of retired old men, " Hsieh says, and he is worried that a
tradition that dates back more than 300 years, when Donglong Temple organized
its first triennial Wang Yeh worshipping ceremony, could be without its main
prop.</P>
      <P>Wang Yeh's vessel, however, has not always been built completely with wood. In
the early days, the ceremonial boat had a bamboo frame and paper body. It was
not until 1973 that local residents had enough money to build a real boat, Hsieh
recalls.</P>
      <P>Wang Yeh's boat is actually modeled after an imperial boat in ancient China that
was prevalent in the Fujian and Shantou areas.</P>
      <P>"It wasn't as big as the one we build now, " Hsieh says, explaining that the
boat's size in the first festival in Taiwan was about 11.4 meters by 1.7 meters
and has expanded each time the ceremony has been held -- until 2009.</P>
      <P>Wang Yeh's boat this year measures the same size it did in 2006 -- 13.8m long by
3.65m wide by 1.75m high -- because if it were made any bigger, it could not be
carried through the streets of Donggang.</P>
      <P>But its price tag of NT$6.6 million this year was about 10 percent higher than
three years ago because of more expensive raw materials, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>On Friday, the colorful boat made of high quality Vietnamese juniper was pulled
by people for a "sail" on the streets of the fishing port. The procession
symbolizes the gods patrolling the Donggang area to expel evil spirits and
plagues.</P>
      <P>During the procession, the boat received offerings for Wang Yeh from local
worshippers. It was brought back to the temple at around 6 p.m. and will be
taken to Jhenhai Park at 2 a.m. Saturday for the burning ritual that ends the
week-long festival.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Acer heads list of top 10 Taiwan Global Brands in 2009</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16 (CNA)
10/16/09  21:49:25

    <TEXT>
      <P>Computer vendor Acer Inc. was unveiled Friday as Taiwan's leading brand on a
list of Taiwan's Top 10 Global Brands for the first time ever, with anti-virus
software maker Trend Micro and computer maker AsusTek close behind.</P>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew handed out awards to all of the companies on the top
10 list at Friday's awards ceremony, a component of the government's Branding
Taiwan program created in 2003 aimed at building globally popular brands.</P>
      <P>Acer headed the top 10 list with an estimated brand value of US$1.24 billion,
thanks to its mergers with Gateway and Packard Bell in 2007 and its successful
launch of netbook computers, according to officials from the event's co-sponsor,
the semi-official Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA).</P>
      <P>Acer is Taiwan's largest vendor of laptop computers, and the world's second
largest computer vendor after surpassing Dell in the third quarter of 2009.</P>
      <P>Its product lineup includes desktops, laptops, personal digital assistants
(PDAs), servers and storage, displays, peripherals, and e-business services for
business, government, education, and home users.</P>
      <P>Filling out the top 10 brand list were, in order, HTC, Master Kong, Want Want,
Maxxis, Giant, Synnex and Zyxel.</P>
      <P>Master Kong and Giant have made it into the top 10 every year since the list was
created, even though it has been traditionally dominated by high-tech companies.
Over the past seven years, Trend Micro has occupied the No. 1 spot five times.</P>
      <P>But the continued presence of conventional businesses such as food processor
Master Kong and bicycle maker Giant, along with rice snack maker Want Want was
worth noting, according to global brand consultancy Interbrand.</P>
      <P>The brand expert attributed  Master Kong's listing to its prevailing market
share in the Chinese market, which has spared the company from the adverse
effects of the global economic crunch and helped its brand value appreciate by
19 percent in 2009 to US$916 million.</P>
      <P>Want Want, which made the list for the first time, was estimated to have a brand
value of US$421 million, while Giant had a brand value of US$262 million.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Gov't plans to provide NT$1b to promote creative industries</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) plans to subsidize NT$1 billion in
discounts on student tickets for performances by local arts and cultural groups
to help foster cultural and creative industries, a council official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Fang Jy-Shiuh, director of the council's first department, said the government
hoped the trial program would expand the demand for arts and cultural events.</P>
      <P>A plan to offer tax incentives to encourage cultural consumption had originally
been considered but was eventually scrapped after taking into account other
potential consequences.</P>
      <P>The government therefore decided to provide NT$1 billion a year for the subsidy
program on a trial basis, Fang said in announcing the program at a seminar on
the development of Taiwan's cultural and creative industries organized by the
Taiwan Competitiveness Forum.</P>
      <P>Noting that the subsidy program falls under the provisions of the Cultural and
Creative Industry Development Draft Act, Fang said that although the act has yet
to be enacted, the CCA has begun mapping out the subsidy plan.</P>
      <P>Fang also said that one of the CCA's main objectives is to help creative
industries penetrate Chinese-speaking and international markets.</P>
      <P>In the initial stage, the two sides can start by jointly holding large scale
cultural and creative expositions and establishing a dialogue mechanism, she
suggested.</P>
      <P>She added that the CCA will work to promote industry cooperation between Taiwan
and China in the areas of investment protection, intellectual property rights
protection and joint ventures into international markets.</P>
      <P>The cultural and creative industries  of Taiwan and China complement each other,
Fang contended, citing China's huge market, abundant capital, vast land and a
sound cultural policy related to creative industries,  and Taiwan's strong
talent pool and its favorable and free environment to support the industry's
development.</P>
      <P>Kuo Su-chen, chief of a creative belly dance troupe and winner of the ninth
Ahlan Wa Sahlan Belly Dance Festival in July 2008 in Egypt, said at the seminar
that she believes the subsidy program will help expand arts and cultural
consumption.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that if performing groups are not famous enough, they usually find it
difficult to sell tickets to their shows. She also suggested  that the CCA
should first provide a platform  for performances to help boost performing
groups' popularity.</P>
      <P>Huang  Ching-lung,  president  of Want Daily,  one of the Taiwan-based China
Times Group's publications, said no industry can afford to neglect the massive
Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Huang cited the contrasting experiences of two singers, Taiwan's top female
Hoklo singer Chiang Huei and Hong Kong Jacky Cheung.</P>
      <P>Both singers sold 1 million copies of their hit albums in their home markets,
but Cheung's "Kiss Goodbye" sold 5 million copies in Chinese communities around
the world, while Chiang failed to sell her album outside Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's cultural and creative industries encompass the visual arts, music and
performing arts, cultural exhibitions and performance facilities, films, TV and
broadcasting, publishing, advertising, and product design.</P>
      <P>They also extend to fashion and architectural design, creative living, digital
leisure and amusement industries, according to the definition by the center for
promoting Taiwan's cultural and creative industries under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Progress in cross-strait ties expected ahead: U.S. academic</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct.16 (CNA)
10/16/09  22:26:18
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot and other extraneous factors have combined to frustrate progress
in relations across the Taiwan Strait recently but have not stifled positive
momentum, and progress in cross-strait ties is expected to resume in the coming
quarter, a U.S. scholar forecast in a recent report.</P>
      <P>The online quarterly report, titled China-Taiwan Relations: Temporarily in the
Doldrums, was authored by David G. Brown, a cross-strait affairs expert at the
Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.</P>
      <P>According to Brown, it is largely extraneous developments, rather than policy
changes, that have impeded progress in cross-strait ties in the July-September
quarter.</P>
      <P>"Typhoon Morakot consumed public and government attention on Taiwan for three
weeks in August and then led to Cabinet changes affecting some of the senior
officials handling cross-Strait economic issues," Brown wrote.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Morakot occasioned two positive developments, Brown argued.
First, Beijing was prompt and generous in providing financial and practical aid.
Second, the U.S. also provided aid, which included the first deployment of U.S.
military aircraft to Taiwan since 1979.</P>
      <P>"This potentially sensitive action was handled discreetly, with Beijing
portraying it as a humanitarian action, the U.S. planes leaving as soon as their
humanitarian work was concluded, and neither Taipei nor Washington gave the
action any broader significance, " Brown wrote.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu's decision to invite the Dalai Lama to console Morakot
victims presented a dilemma for Taiwan's President Ma Ying-jeou and for Beijing.</P>
      <P>"In the end, both sides handled the issue in a way that delayed some minor
cross-Strait events but did not significantly disrupt relations," Brown
observed.</P>
      <P>He predicted that progress in improving cross-strait relations should resume in
the coming months.</P>
      <P>Brown suggested, however, that the easy agreements were concluded in the first
three meetings between top officials of Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) and Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>More difficult issues involving the usual balancing of interests in bilateral
trade negotiations have affected the pace of talks on both the memorandums of
understanding (MOUs) covering banking, insurance and securities and the proposed
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA), Brown contended.</P>
      <P>The financial MOUs, which were to have been completed in late June, are still
pending. The financial regulatory systems to be defined in the MOUs must be in
place before the two sides can reciprocally approve operations by financial
services firms.</P>
      <P>The MOUs are expected to be signed before the end of the year, Brown said,
citing China's Taiwan Affairs Office.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Brown pointed out that the fourth round of SEF-ARATS talks is
scheduled to be held late this year and should result in additional  agreements,
possibly including  ones on fisheries, agricultural product standards, product
testing, double taxation and a discussion on ECFA.</P>
      <P>On cross-strait economic ties, Brown said bilateral trade is beginning to
recover from the precipitous decline caused by the global financial crisis and
the first group of Chinese investments in Taiwan, although small, have been
approved.</P>
      <P>Citing tallies compiled by Taiwan's Investment Commission, the report said eight
Chinese investments totaling US$769,000 were made during July and August with
Fujia Newland Computers making the largest single investment.</P>
      <P>With cross-strait relations proceeding constructively, the U.S. government's
role is limited. Nevertheless, Brown said arms sales are one important exception
that needs to be handled in a sophisticated way to support the long-term U.S.
interest in a peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>"It is in the U.S. interest to support a government in Taiwan that is working
constructively to consolidate a stable, peaceful cross-strait relationship,"
Brown argued.</P>
      <P>Taipei is requesting arms so it can maintain a "credible deterrent position"
from which to negotiate.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, as the Ma administration is being criticized at home for not doing
enough for Taiwan's defense, Brown wrote, the fact that there has been little
concrete evidence of support for Taipei from the Obama administration is calling
into question Ma's ability to successfully manage the all important U.S.-Taiwan
relationship.</P>
      <P>"With Beijing's deployments growing, there is a sound case for the U.S. to move
ahead with the Blackhawk sale and to respond favorably to Taiwan's request for
the F-16C/D aircraft, which are increasingly seen as a litmus test of U.S.
support," Brown wrote.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Continuity in store for future U.S.-Taiwan-China relations: Paal</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16 (CNA)
10/16/09  22:46:00
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Douglas Paal, former director of the American Institute in Taiwan, said Friday
in Taipei that "continuity" will characterize prospects for the short-term
strategic paths of the United States, Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>The proposition was reinforced by last year's election of a Taiwan
administration that seeks to eschew unnecessary friction with China and seek
areas of cooperation with Beijing, according to Paal.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan has at least two and a half years to seek success with its
approach, and Beijing still appears willing to cooperate, though always with a
wary eye to the downside risks.</P>
      <P>Paal, who is now vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, said at the seminar titled Taipei- Washington-Beijing
Relations under the Ma and Obama Administratopms" that both China and the U.S.
are also likely to continue their current tactics.</P>
      <P>He said China's direction, economically and otherwise, appears to enjoy what
passes for a consensus on the mainland, while the U.S., under the new Obama
administration, is actively seeking to accentuate the positive with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Obama has indentified the financial crisis, climate change, and non-
proliferation as his key themes and has been seeking and initially obtaining
Chinese cooperation in these areas, he added.</P>
      <P>Paal also argued that Obama would undoubtedly like to see Taiwan shoulder an
appropriate share of the burden of its own necessary defense.</P>
      <P>"Indications are that his (Obama's) administration will assess Taiwan's requests
with an eye to the actual situation rather than just the statements of China's
leaders," Paal said.</P>
      <P>"The friction that could result should be manageable within the broader positive
context in U.S.-China relations, and in Taiwan's own efforts to avoid clumsily
treading on sensitivities and to seek common interests," he added.</P>
      <P>In the long term, Paal said whether the U.S., Taiwan, and China will change
their strategic courses will depend on three factors that include the ability of
the Ma Ying-jeou administration to demonstrate to Taiwan's voters that his
policies are worth continuing.</P>
      <P>The other two factors are China's avoidance of a domestic crisis, driven by
factors such as a financial collapse, a failure to stimulate domestic
consumption, or an embarrassing international setback; and America's
readjustment of its economic trajectory from a capital importing to a capital
exporting country, the downsizing of its international exposure to conflict, and
fiscal responsibility, he added.</P>
      <P>"These are significant threats, if now remote, to the positive sum game the
triangular relationship has entered. The emergence of a significant change in
any one of them will have a negative impact on the other two," Paal said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The current global economic crisis has inflicted greater harm on Taiwan than
South Korea, scholars at a Taipei forum said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to a forecast by the Manila-based Asian Development Bank (ADB) in late
September, Taiwan's economy is expected to contract 4.9 percent this year,
compared to South Korea's 2 percent.</P>
      <P>Chou Chi, director of the Economics Department of the Shih Hsin University, said
that Taiwan outperformed South Korea in coping with the 1997 Asian financial
crisis, but since then South Korea has adopted an economic development approach
that has differed from Taiwan's and yielded a relatively satisfactory result.</P>
      <P>For example, Taiwan's average real wage (salary) has remained relatively
unchanged over the past 10 years and now accounts for only 60 percent of that of
South Korea, in part because of the latter's rising productivity.</P>
      <P>Echoing Chou, Hu Chung Ying, the vice chairman of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development, argued that Taiwan has put too much emphasis on the
development of export-oriented  high-tech industries, in sharp contrast to South
Korea's more diverse policy of pushing shipbuilding, transportation, the
automotive sector and high-tech industries as its development priorities.</P>
      <P>Hu urged the government to seek to break the "bottleneck" by accelerating the
development of the service sector over the next 10 years.</P>
      <P>You Chi-tsung, the deputy director of the Industrial Technology Research
Institute's Industrial Economics and Knowledge Center, attributed Taiwan's
lackluster performance to its relatively poor ability to create high value-added
goods.</P>
      <P>The decline in Taiwan's value-added rate from 27.8 percent in 1999 to 18.46
percent in 2008 stemmed in part from its industrial structure that was not
geared to increasing incomes and the quality of life.</P>

      <P>Grilled on the difficulties Taiwanese gold medalists at international sports
competitions are having finding jobs, Premier Wu Den-yih said Friday that the
central government had an obligation to secure jobs for athletes placing in the
top three of major sports events.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang Legislator Huang Chih-hsiung, a silver medalist in taekwondo at the
2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, raised the issue at a Legislative Yuan hearing
Friday.</P>
      <P>He said that in view of the problems faced by Taiwanese medal winners  at this
summer's  Kaohsiung  World Games  and Taipei Deaflympics, the government should
help outstanding athletes find ways to make a living.</P>
      <P>Wu said he will direct the Cabinet-level Sports Affairs Council to come up with
a plan to arrange for award-winning athletes in the recently concluded
competitions to serve as coaches in table tennis, swimming, baseball and other
relevant sports.</P>
      <P>Major state-owned enterprises are also willing to financially support local
baseball and basketball teams to hire medal-winning athletes to be their
coaches, Wu said.</P>
      <P>He also promised that the Executive Yuan would collaborate with local
governments in helping outstanding athletes find jobs.</P>
      <P>During the session, Huang also expressed concern that local students exercise
too and eat too much.</P>
      <P>Minister of Education Wu Ching-chi said his ministry has launched a "health
campus" campaign to encourage  students to exercise regularly and adequately
while adopting a balanced diet.</P>
      <P>"We will encourage local governments to suggest public schools in their
districts to provide full vegetarian lunches once a week for their students," Wu
said.</P>

      <P>Chairman Chiang Pin-kung of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Friday
that his Chinese counterpart, Chen Yunlin. is not scheduled to meet President Ma
Ying-jeou when he visits Taiwan for the coming round of talks in December.</P>
      <P>Chen, president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS), paid a brief and awkward courtesy call to Ma at the Taipei Guest House
last November, when he was in Taipei for the second round of cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>Chiang did not specify a reason why Chen and Ma will not meet.</P>
      <P>Both SEF and ARATS are authorized  by Taiwan  and China, respectively, to handle
cross-strait exchanges in the absence of formal contacts between the two sides.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou confirmed Friday that a controversial economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) will not be on the agenda of the fourth
round of talks.</P>
      <P>The topics of discussion will be cooperation on fishermen, agricultural
quarantine inspection, industrial product standards, inspection and
certification, and the avoidance of double taxation, Ma said.</P>
      <P>In a meeting with American scholars in Taiwan for a seminar on Taipei-Beijing-
Washington  relations,  Ma  reiterated  that  the government will secure the
country's sovereignty and interests while seeking to improve relations with
China.</P>
      <P>Ma said that over the past year or so, the government has made great efforts to
reduce hostility between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait with satisfactory
results, including nine agreements signed in the past three rounds of talks
between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Those pacts have made possible the establishment of air, trade and postal links
between Taiwan and China, visits to Taiwan by Chinese tourists, and cross-strait
judicial assistance.</P>
      <P>Defending his new diplomatic approach that seeks to avoid competition with China
over diplomatic allies, Ma said that a climate of reconciliation has been made
possible not only in the Taiwan Strait but also in the international arena.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was able to be represented by a retired high-ranking official at last
year's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit meeting, and to take part
in this year's World Health Assembly (WHA).</P>
      <P>On the nation's future diplomatic operation agenda, Ma told the visiting
scholars that the government will seek to take part in such international
agencies that are deeply related to the safety of the nation and people but have
no political significance, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the International Civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO).</P>

      <P>"This year we organized seven groups, who went to Nepal, Ghana, Indonesia's Aceh

province," Wang said.</P>
      <P>The Nepal group stayed there for over two weeks, the longest stay of any group.
The student volunteers lived in tents they erected on their own and went without
running water and electricity. They helped with free medical services in an
isolated mountain village that can be reached only on foot.</P>
      <P>You Chun-wei, a graduate student who grew up in metropolitain Taipei, said it

      <P>The decline in Taiwan's value-added rate from 27.8 percent in 1999 to 18.46
percent in 2008 stemmed in part from its industrial structure that was not
geared to increasing incomes and the quality of life.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chinese negotiator not to meet President Ma at upcoming talks</HEADLINE>

      <P>Chairman Chiang Pin-kung of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Friday
that his Chinese counterpart, Chen Yunlin. is not scheduled to meet President Ma
Ying-jeou when he visits Taiwan for the coming round of talks in December.</P>
      <P>Chen, president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS), paid a brief and awkward courtesy call to Ma at the Taipei Guest House
last November, when he was in Taipei for the second round of cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>Chiang did not specify a reason why Chen and Ma will not meet.</P>
      <P>Both SEF and ARATS are authorized  by Taiwan  and China, respectively, to handle
cross-strait exchanges in the absence of formal contacts between the two sides.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou confirmed Friday that a controversial economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) will not be on the agenda of the fourth
round of talks.</P>
      <P>The topics of discussion will be cooperation on fishermen, agricultural
quarantine inspection, industrial product standards, inspection and
certification, and the avoidance of double taxation, Ma said.</P>
      <P>In a meeting with American scholars in Taiwan for a seminar on Taipei-Beijing-
Washington  relations,  Ma  reiterated  that  the government will secure the
country's sovereignty and interests while seeking to improve relations with
China.</P>
      <P>Ma said that over the past year or so, the government has made great efforts to
reduce hostility between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait with satisfactory
results, including nine agreements signed in the past three rounds of talks
between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Those pacts have made possible the establishment of air, trade and postal links
between Taiwan and China, visits to Taiwan by Chinese tourists, and cross-strait
judicial assistance.</P>
      <P>Defending his new diplomatic approach that seeks to avoid competition with China
over diplomatic allies, Ma said that a climate of reconciliation has been made
possible not only in the Taiwan Strait but also in the international arena.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was able to be represented by a retired high-ranking official at last
year's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit meeting, and to take part
in this year's World Health Assembly (WHA).</P>
      <P>On the nation's future diplomatic operation agenda, Ma told the visiting
scholars that the government will seek to take part in such international
agencies that are deeply related to the safety of the nation and people but have
no political significance, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the International Civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Continuity in store for future U.S.-Taiwan-China relations: Paal</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Douglas Paal, former director of the American Institute in Taiwan, said Friday
in Taipei that "continuity" will characterize prospects for the short-term
strategic paths of the United States, Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>The proposition was reinforced by last year's election of a Taiwan
administration that seeks to eschew unnecessary friction with China and seek
areas of cooperation with Beijing, according to Paal.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan has at least two and a half years to seek success with its
approach, and Beijing still appears willing to cooperate, though always with a
wary eye to the downside risks.</P>
      <P>Paal, who is now vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, said at the seminar titled Taipei- Washington-Beijing
Relations under the Ma and Obama Administratopms" that both China and the U.S.
are also likely to continue their current tactics.</P>
      <P>He said China's direction, economically and otherwise, appears to enjoy what
passes for a consensus on the mainland, while the U.S., under the new Obama
administration, is actively seeking to accentuate the positive with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Obama has indentified the financial crisis, climate change, and non-
proliferation as his key themes and has been seeking and initially obtaining
Chinese cooperation in these areas, he added.</P>
      <P>Paal also argued that Obama would undoubtedly like to see Taiwan shoulder an
appropriate share of the burden of its own necessary defense.</P>
      <P>"Indications are that his (Obama's) administration will assess Taiwan's requests
with an eye to the actual situation rather than just the statements of China's
leaders," Paal said.</P>
      <P>"The friction that could result should be manageable within the broader positive
context in U.S.-China relations, and in Taiwan's own efforts to avoid clumsily
treading on sensitivities and to seek common interests," he added.</P>
      <P>In the long term, Paal said whether the U.S., Taiwan, and China will change
their strategic courses will depend on three factors that include the ability of
the Ma Ying-jeou administration to demonstrate to Taiwan's voters that his
policies are worth continuing.</P>
      <P>The other two factors are China's avoidance of a domestic crisis, driven by
factors such as a financial collapse, a failure to stimulate domestic
consumption, or an embarrassing international setback; and America's
readjustment of its economic trajectory from a capital importing to a capital
exporting country, the downsizing of its international exposure to conflict, and
fiscal responsibility, he added.</P>
      <P>"These are significant threats, if now remote, to the positive sum game the
triangular relationship has entered. The emergence of a significant change in
any one of them will have a negative impact on the other two," Paal said.</P>

      <P>Volunteer services in remote foreign countries have helped young students learn
to overcome barriers with perseverance and to treat different cultures and
ethnic groups with humility and sincerity, a National Tsinghua University
spokesman said Friday.</P>
      <P>Wang Chun-cheng, Tsinghua's deputy academic affairs chief who concurrently heads
the extracurricular affairs section, made the remarks at a news conference in
which a group of students shared their overseas service experiences during this
past summer.</P>
      <P>Wang said the university in northern Taiwan has organized overseas  volunteer
service programs  for students  for three consectuive years.</P>
      <P>"This year we organized seven groups, who went to Nepal, Ghana, Indonesia's Aceh
and Medan areas, Tanzania, and China's Qinghai province and Yinchuan in Ningxia
province," Wang said.</P>
      <P>The Nepal group stayed there for over two weeks, the longest stay of any group.
The student volunteers lived in tents they erected on their own and went without
running water and electricity. They helped with free medical services in an
isolated mountain village that can be reached only on foot.</P>
      <P>You Chun-wei, a graduate student who grew up in metropolitain Taipei, said it
was an unforgettable experience to work and live in such a primitive
environment.</P>
      <P>You and his classmates also helped teach locals public health knowledge and
establish a digitalized medical data system.</P>
      <P>As most Tsinghua students focus their studies on engineering and science,
volunteer  groups to Tanzania  and Ghana helped the communities they visited

    <HEADLINE>Gov't plans to provide NT$1 b. to promote creative industries</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) plans to subsidize NT$1 billion in
discounts on student tickets for performances by local arts and cultural groups
to help foster cultural and creative industries, a council official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Fang Jy-Shiuh, director of the council's first department, said the government
hoped the trial program would expand the demand for arts and cultural events.</P>
      <P>A plan to offer tax incentives to encourage cultural consumption had originally
been considered but was eventually scrapped after taking into account other
potential consequences.</P>
      <P>The government therefore decided to provide NT$1 billion a year for the subsidy
program on a trial basis, Fang said in announcing the program at a seminar on
the development of Taiwan's cultural and creative industries organized by the
Taiwan Competitiveness Forum.</P>
      <P>Noting that the subsidy program falls under the provisions of the Cultural and
Creative Industry Development Draft Act, Fang said that although the act has yet
to be enacted, the CCA has begun mapping out the subsidy plan.</P>
      <P>Fang also said that one of the CCA's main objectives is to help creative
industries penetrate Chinese-speaking and international markets.</P>
      <P>In the initial stage, the two sides can start by jointly holding large scale
cultural and creative expositions and establishing a dialogue mechanism, she
suggested.</P>
      <P>She added that the CCA will work to promote industry cooperation between Taiwan
and China in the areas of investment protection, intellectual property rights
protection and joint ventures into international markets.</P>
      <P>The cultural and creative industries  of Taiwan and China complement each other,
Fang contended, citing China's huge market, abundant capital, vast land and a
sound cultural policy related to creative industries,  and Taiwan's strong
talent pool and its favorable and free environment to support the industry's
development.</P>
      <P>Kuo Su-chen, chief of a creative belly dance troupe and winner of the ninth
Ahlan Wa Sahlan Belly Dance Festival in July 2008 in Egypt, said at the seminar
that she believes the subsidy program will help expand arts and cultural
consumption.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that if performing groups are not famous enough, they usually find it
difficult to sell tickets to their shows. She also suggested  that the CCA
should first provide a platform  for performances to help boost performing
groups' popularity.</P>
      <P>Huang  Ching-lung,  president  of Want Daily,  one of the Taiwan-based China
Times Group's publications, said no industry can afford to neglect the massive
Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Huang cited the contrasting experiences of two singers, Taiwan's top female
Hoklo singer Chiang Huei and Hong Kong Jacky Cheung.</P>
      <P>Both singers sold 1 million copies of their hit albums in their home markets,
but Cheung's "Kiss Goodbye" sold 5 million copies in Chinese communities around
the world, while Chiang failed to sell her album outside Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's cultural and creative industries encompass the visual arts, music and
performing arts, cultural exhibitions and performance facilities, films, TV and
broadcasting, publishing, advertising, and product design.</P>
      <P>They also extend to fashion and architectural design, creative living, digital
leisure and amusement industries, according to the definition by the center for
promoting Taiwan's cultural and creative industries under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Progress in cross-strait ties expected ahead: U.S. academic</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct.16 (CNA)
10/17/09  12:05:13
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot and other extraneous factors have combined to frustrate progress
in relations across the Taiwan Strait recently but have not stifled positive
momentum, and progress in cross-strait ties is expected to resume in the coming
quarter, a U.S. scholar forecast in a recent report.</P>
      <P>The online quarterly report, titled China-Taiwan Relations: Temporarily in the
Doldrums, was authored by David G. Brown, a cross-strait affairs expert at the
Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.</P>
      <P>According to Brown, it is largely extraneous developments, rather than policy
changes, that have impeded progress in cross-strait ties in the July-September
quarter.</P>
      <P>"Typhoon Morakot consumed public and government attention on Taiwan for three
weeks in August and then led to Cabinet changes affecting some of the senior
officials handling cross-Strait economic issues," Brown wrote.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Morakot occasioned two positive developments, Brown argued.
First, Beijing was prompt and generous in providing financial and practical aid.
Second, the U.S. also provided aid, which included the first deployment of U.S.
military aircraft to Taiwan since 1979.</P>
      <P>"This potentially sensitive action was handled discreetly, with Beijing
portraying it as a humanitarian action, the U.S. planes leaving as soon as their
humanitarian work was concluded, and neither Taipei nor Washington gave the
action any broader significance, " Brown wrote.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu's decision to invite the Dalai Lama to console Morakot
victims presented a dilemma for Taiwan's President Ma Ying-jeou and for Beijing.</P>
      <P>"In the end, both sides handled the issue in a way that delayed some minor
cross-Strait events but did not significantly disrupt relations," Brown
observed.</P>
      <P>He predicted that progress in improving cross-strait relations should resume in
the coming months.</P>
      <P>Brown suggested, however, that the easy agreements were concluded in the first
three meetings between top officials of Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) and Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>More difficult issues involving the usual balancing of interests in bilateral
trade negotiations have affected the pace of talks on both the memorandums of
understanding (MOUs) covering banking, insurance and securities and the proposed
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA), Brown contended.</P>
      <P>The financial MOUs, which were to have been completed in late June, are still
pending. The financial regulatory systems to be defined in the MOUs must be in
place before the two sides can reciprocally approve operations by financial
services firms.</P>
      <P>The MOUs are expected to be signed before the end of the year, Brown said,
citing China's Taiwan Affairs Office.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Brown pointed out that the fourth round of SEF-ARATS talks is
scheduled to be held late this year and should result in additional  agreements,
possibly including  ones on fisheries, agricultural product standards, product
testing, double taxation and a discussion on ECFA.</P>
      <P>On cross-strait economic ties, Brown said bilateral trade is beginning to
recover from the precipitous decline caused by the global financial crisis and
the first group of Chinese investments in Taiwan, although small, have been
approved.</P>
      <P>Citing tallies compiled by Taiwan's Investment Commission, the report said eight
Chinese investments totaling US$769,000 were made during July and August with
Fujia Newland Computers making the largest single investment.</P>
      <P>With cross-strait relations proceeding constructively, the U.S. government's
role is limited. Nevertheless, Brown said arms sales are one important exception
that needs to be handled in a sophisticated way to support the long-term U.S.
interest in a peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>"It is in the U.S. interest to support a government in Taiwan that is working
constructively to consolidate a stable, peaceful cross-strait relationship,"
Brown argued.</P>
      <P>Taipei is requesting arms so it can maintain a "credible deterrent position"
from which to negotiate.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, as the Ma administration is being criticized at home for not doing
enough for Taiwan's defense, Brown wrote, the fact that there has been little
concrete evidence of support for Taipei from the Obama administration is calling
into question Ma's ability to successfully manage the all important U.S.-Taiwan
relationship.</P>
      <P>"With Beijing's deployments growing, there is a sound case for the U.S. to move
ahead with the Blackhawk sale and to respond favorably to Taiwan's request for
the F-16C/D aircraft, which are increasingly seen as a litmus test of U.S.
support," Brown wrote.</P>

      <P>The periphery of Typhoon Lupit is likely to bring heavy rains to Taiwan next
week, although it remains uncertain whether the storm will hit Taiwan, the
Central Weather Bureau (CWB) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>As of Saturday morning, Lupit was centered 1,600 kilometers east-southeast  of
Hengchun,  Taiwan's  southernmost  tip,  CWB forecasters said.</P>
      <P>The storm's radius had expanded to 200 kilometers and was moving northwesterly
at 13 kph toward the northeastern part of the Philippines. It has maximum
sustained winds of 126 kph,  but forecasters expected the storm to intensify as
it moves closer to land.</P>
      <P>The forecasters said it is still too early to predict if Lupit will hit Taiwan,
but the storm's periphery will affect Hengchun and the northern and eastern

      <P>Taiwan's chief negotiator with China proposed Friday that a controversial cross-

his fifth round of talks with his Chinese counterpart, expected in the first
half of next year.</P>
      <P>Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)

Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>The upcoming meeting, the fourth in a series since June 2008, will take place in
December in the central city of Taichung. The two officials are expected to sign
four agreements regarding fishing crew cooperation, agricultural quarantine
inspection, industrial product standards, inspection and certification, and the
avoidance of double taxation.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Chiang and Chen will also discuss the proposed items to be
included on the agenda of the fifth round of talks.</P>
      <P>According to Chiang, in addition to the signing of the ECFA, the SEF also hopes
that an investment protection agreement can be signed at that time.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has been pushing for the signing of the ECFA with China
in an effort to reduce the impact of the new China-Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) free trade area on Taiwanese businesses.</P>
      <P>After the China-ASEAN economic integration, which begins Jan. 1, 2010,
petrochemical products,  textiles,  automobile parts and machinery exports from
ASEAN members to China will enjoy tariff-free treatment, which will seriously
undermine the competitiveness of similar products from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs has recently completed a tentative early-
harvest list that would be included in the proposed ECFA and is expected to

      <P>Critics of the proposed pact argue that it will undermine Taiwan's sovereignty

      <P>Taiwan's Taoyuan County was named as one of the Smart21 Communities of the year
for the second straight year by the Intelligent Community Forum (ICF) Friday for
its efforts to make its economy more robust and improve its quality of living
through information and communications technology.</P>
      <P>The Smart21 announcement is the first stage of the New York-based think tank's
annual Intelligent Community Awards' 12-month cycle. Taoyuan County hopes to be
selected to the Top Seven Intelligent Communities of the Year for 2010 in
January from the 21 nominees announced Friday.</P>
      <P>The 2010 Intelligent Community of the year will be named in May from the seven
finalists. Taipei grabbed the top prize in 2006 when President Ma Ying-jeou was
still mayor of the city.</P>
      <P>Sweden's Stockholm won the award for 2009, but Asian communities have garnered
the top spot three out of the past five years.</P>
      <P>The new Smart21 list represents 13 nations and includes 10 communities that
appeared on last year's list. None have populations over 2.5 million.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Taoyuan, Korea's Suwon, and China's Tianjin Binhai are the only three
Asian communities on the 2010 list.</P>
      <P>Taoyuan County was praised for taking action to offset its high sensitivity to
the business cycle and powerful competition from Taipei. The ICF cited its
"Aerotropolis" initiative to strengthen the local economy and its "M-Taoyuan"
program launched in 2007 to make e-government mobile.</P>
      <P>The M-Taoyuan program covers the core of the metro area and offers "real-time
traffic analysis,  remote monitoring,  mobile distribution of information to the
public and access to resources for government workers on the go," the ICF said.</P>
      <P>The think tank also anticipated the county's "U-Taoyuan" program that "will
focus on ubiquitous digital services for aviation, shipping  and other
businesses,  (and weave)  digital services seamlessly into the lives of all
residents."</P>
      <P>Taoyuan County first made it into the Smart21 in 2009, and won the 2009 ICF
Founders Awards for the "Aerotropolis" project, a broad and comprehensively
planned integration of digital infrastructure and support services for an
expanding aviation business cluster.</P>
      <P>In announcing the Founders Awards in March 2009, the ICF specifically
highlighted  the achievements  of Taoyuan  County Magistrate Eric Liluan Chu,
Taiwan's youngest magistrate who led Taoyuan for eight years and is now vice
premier.</P>
      <P>Taoyuan is hoping to become the second Taiwanese community to win the
Intelligent Community award after Taipei.</P>
      <P>The ICF said Taipei was the world's largest producer of laptop and notebook
computers and computer motherboards, and the city government had made it a
priority to reduce the time and resources needed to turn students into
productive knowledge workers.</P>

      <P>Ma said in his address that the assistance of Lien and Wu will be essential for
the party to overcome numerous challenges ahead.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that under Wu's leadership that ran two years and eight months, the KMT
sailed through its most difficult period and won the legislative and
presidential elections, and he said he expects Wu to continue to help the party
promote cooperation and exchanges with China.</P>
      <P>Also, Ma said he hopes Lien, who has made a "journey of peace" to China and
represented Taiwan in the leaders summit of the 2008 Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum in Peru, will continue his contribution in these areas.</P>
      <P>Ma stressed that the past era in which "the ruling party overrode the
government" has long past and that what prevails today is an era of "the party
supporting the government."</P>
      <P>Ma promised he will seek to strengthen the KMT Central Standing Committee's
function as a platform for party-government coordination.</P>
      <P>On the year-end local elections, Ma said whether the party can stand in
solidarity will decide whether it will achieve victory.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, the party must take disciplinary action against members
running in the elections  without the party's nomination to maintain its unity.
He also pledged to promote clean politics by strictly forbidding party members
from engaging in vote buying.</P>
      <P>He said the party will put forth a final plan by the end of this year on how to
deal with its controversial assets. He promised the KMT will stop any business
operations after selling the Central Investment Holding Co., and will rely on
fund-raising activities to obtain the money needed for election campaigns.</P>
      <P>On relations with China, Ma said the KMT will prioritize Taiwan's interests and
the well-being of its people in promoting cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>A five-point consensus reached by Lien and Communist Party of China (CPC)
General Secretary Hu Jintao during Lien's visit to China in 2005 will be
included in the KMT's platform, and the dialogue between the KMT and the CCP
will also continue, Ma said.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) should step up its efforts to persuade
areas and countries enjoying visa-free treatment to Taiwan to offer reciprocal
treatment, a report by the Legislative Yuan said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan offers visa-exemption  privileges to people from 38 countries and areas,
while only six of them afford the same treatment to Taiwan nationals, said the
report prepared by the Legislature's Budgetary Research Center after reviewing
the 2010 budget plan submitted by the MOFA's Bureau of Consular Affairs.</P>
      <P>Britain, Liechtenstein, Ireland, Japan, South Korea and Singapore allow Taiwan
visitors to enter without visas for a stay ranging from 30-180 days.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau, seeking reciprocal privileges from more of those 38
countries and areas, such as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand,
Germany, France and Italy, will be one of its main tasks next year.</P>
      <P>These countries and areas are destinations more frequently visited by outbound
Taiwanese tourists and businessmen than the 30 countries, principally in Central
and South America, that permit Taiwan passport holders to enter without applying
for visas in advance.</P>
      <P>The center, therefore, asked the MOFA to take measures targeting these countries
or areas to offer visa-free treatment to Taiwanese travelers.</P>

      <P>A mobile navigation services platform jointly developed by 11 Taiwanese
universities will allow travelers to travel light if they have a smart phone on
hand, developers of the platform  said Friday  after the first  year of the
system's development.</P>
      <P>The planned platform combines a wireless Internet network, GPS, an electronic
map navigation system, a Web 2.0 interface and a multimedia data bank, allowing
users to download data and information on a tourist attraction's cultural and
historic features and suggested itineraries.</P>
      <P>With the new platform, developed through the cooperation of teachers and
students in information engineering and cultural science departments around
Taiwan, users won't need tour guides and maps, according to a professor who
helped develop the system.</P>
      <P>"Are you planning to visit Fengtien village in Hualien County? You can download
related data before setting off, or let the GPS take you there before
downloading data that tells you about the history of the village, " National
Cheng Kung University (NCKU) professor Huang Chung-ming said.</P>
      <P>Travelers can also see photos that show old and modern faces of the historic
town that was once colonized by the Japanese in the first half of the 20th
century, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The developers of the project, however, would not reveal when the platform's
development will be completed and put on the market.</P>

      <P>Denmark's top envoy to Taiwan praised the country Saturday for demonstrating its
commitment to combatting climate change, not only through its intention to
attend a crucial meeting on the issue in Copenhagen in December but also with
policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      <P>Flemming Aggergaard, director of the Trade Commission of Denmark in Taipei, told
the Central News Agency that these efforts are important because "it shows that
Taiwan understands the situation."</P>
      <P>"They also show how they (Taiwan and the other countries) are willing to follow
up after the results in Copenhagen and make sure that changes will happen so
that the environment will benefit, " Aggergaard said.</P>
      <P>The international community will gather in Copenhagen in December to decide on
the future depth of reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by working out a new
international climate change agreement before the Kyoto Protocol expires in
2012.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will send a delegation comprised of members from the Ministry of Foreign

      <P>Noting that Taiwan produces around 1 percent of the world's total greenhouse gas
emissions, Aggergaard said that the number is high relative to the island's
relatively small population of 23 million people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Steeped in history, boat burning festival as big a draw as ever</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/17/09  19:19:28
(With reports by Kuo Chi-hsuan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The tradition of burning Wang Yeh's boat has persisted for 300 years, but the
100,000 people who flocked to the fishing port of Donggang in Pingtung County
for this year's eight-day  ritual demonstrated that the attachment to the local
deity has only grown stronger with time.</P>
      <P>The Donggang Wang Yeh festival, the largest temple activity of its kind in
Taiwan, came to its dramatic conclusion at around 5: 30 a.m. on Oct. 17 when
Wang Yeh's boat went up in flames, taking with it local evil spirits and
worshippers' problems.</P>
      <P>The ceremony's somber atmosphere reflected the area's deep-seated belief in this
local "god of pestilence, " whose ability to ward off evil has grown to near
mythic proportions.</P>
      <P>"It was out of fear and ignorance over plagues, typhoid, cholera and malaria
that people in the past put their faith in the god, thinking he can expel deadly
diseases, " says Lin Mao-hsien, an assistant professor of Taiwanese culture and
language at National Taichung University.</P>
      <P>Even today, Wang Yeh, who is believed to be a divine emissary patrolling the
world for the celestial realm, is evoked to expel the H1N1 virus, Lin says.</P>
      <P>This year's festival was the most expensive ever, with the management of the
more than 300-year-old Donglong Temple that runs the event estimating its cost
at NT$1 billion, 20 percent higher than the previous festival in 2006.</P>
      <P>Hank Lin, a Kaohsiung resident who spent the night standing on the beach waiting
for the boat to be burned, was attending the boat burning ceremony for the
second time. He was willing to sacrifice sleep to be there because of the
tradition and his own faith.</P>
      <P>"I believe in Wang Yeh. Since I was in junior high school, I've begun believing
in this faith. In many points of my life, I believe Wang Yeh was there to help
me. It's not just for expelling diseases."</P>
      <P>That faith in the deity over the centuries has been derived from "the desire for
peace and health, the punishment of evil and rewarding the good, along with
strong community cohesion formed around fear-based belief," Lin Mao-hsien
explained.</P>
      <P>Community cohesion has been particularly important because it has made Donggang
natives proud to be from the town along Taiwan's southwest coast.</P>
      <P>Local researcher Chen Chien-chien says that no matter how far away Donggang
natives move, they also return to fulfill their inherited obligations in the
triennial ceremony run by the more than 300-year-old Donglong Temple.</P>
      <P>Full-time residents also put aside their daily jobs to get involved in various
tasks, including building Wang Yeh's boat and helping organize specific rituals
related to the festival.</P>
      <P>"I'd feel bad if I did not get involved in this, particularly during the rituals
of evoking and seeing off Wang Yeh, " said 41-year-old Su Po-wen, who has served
in the festival as a "Ban Tou" -- the title of public officials responsible for
maintaining order during the rituals -- since he was five years old.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the Wang Yeh ceremony was initiated by seven communities of
early settlers in Donggang centuries ago and some of their descendants still
handle the same tasks in the traditional ceremony today.</P>
      <P>Huang Feng-chi, 61, said he inherited his job as a sedan carrier from his
grandfather at the age of six and has done the same job since then. He sees the
job as an honor that will earn him Wang Yeh's direct blessing.</P>
      <P>The eight-day festival opened this year as always with a mysterious and
complicated ritual on the beach of Jhenhai Park. Five Wang Yeh gods joined the
one enshrined at the temple for a four-day procession around Donggang before
they boarded their wooden ship on which they "sailed" around the fishing port's
streets to expel evil spirits and plagues.</P>
      <P>On the seventh day, the temple offered the gods a feast of 108 Chinese dishes
accompanied by fine wine and liquor to thank them for warding off evil during
the processions over the previous week.</P>
      <P>The ritual culminated on Oct. 17 when the elaborately carved wooden boat was set
on fire to symbolize the Wang Yehs setting off to heaven, taking with them the
evil spirits and diseases they absorbed during the processions.</P>
      <P>After Saturday's ceremony, there was only silence. No gongs and drums were
allowed to make a sound, nor were bells, drums, local opera music or fireworks
permitted, to prevent the "the gods from returning to Donggang" Chen said.</P>
      <P>He explained that any festive sounds might have misled the Wang Yehs into
thinking that the worshippers actually wanted them -- and the evil spirits
leaving with them -- to stay.</P>
      <P>Also, no fishing activities will be allowed in the three days following the
ceremony to "prevent fishing boats from colliding with Wang Yeh's boat, " Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Each ritual was performed strictly according to tradition because any planned
change must have the permission of Wang Yeh, said Donglong Temple chief
executive Hsiao Chih-lin.</P>
      <P>Like the Goddess of Mercy Matsu, Wang Yeh is one of Taiwan's most worshipped
local gods, particularly along the southwest coast. Thousands of Wang Yeh
temples dot the region, with several hundred situated in Pingtung alone where
most people live on fishing and agriculture, according to National Taichung
University's Lin.</P>
      <P>The worship of Wang Yeh can be traced back to the Song Dynasty, Lin says. People
in warm, muggy areas of southern China, where plagues often killed large groups
of people, decided to make model junks out of wood, straw and paper and then set
them out to sea or on rivers to symbolize sending away evil and disease.</P>
      <P>When inhabitants of southern China emigrated to Taiwan in the late 16th and 17th
centuries, they replicated the tradition to safeguard their health and peace of
mind.</P>
      <P>Because the symbolic  vessels they built were regarded as transporters of evil
spirits and disease spreaders, no one would go near them while they were being
taken to the water for them to drift away.</P>
      <P>When the ships failed to sink in the seas and drifted back to a local beach,
local residents felt compelled to pick them up and build a temple to enshrine
the gods of pestilence or perform worshipping rituals to comfort them.</P>
      <P>If the rule was not strictly followed, the people would face severe punishment
from the bad-tempered gods, which could result in the annihilation of their
entire village.</P>
      <P>As time passed, the great fear of disasters waned as the lives of the Wang Yeh
worshippers improved and their populations increased. The tradition of letting
Wang Yeh's boats drift away in the water evolved into burning them to avoid
creating panic in neighboring villages.</P>
      <P>Lin Mao-hsien believes that the feeling of ambivalence mixed with respect and
fear consolidated the belief in Wang Yeh in coastal fishing villages.</P>
      <P>"Thanks to the desire for peace of mind and many reported successful cases of
the gods' blessings, the triennial Donglong Temple's Wang Yeh festival has
expanded a little more each time."</P>

      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh called on the public Saturday to respect a
constitutional interpretation related to former President Chen Shui-bian's case
to ensure the rule of law in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Council of Grand Justices on Friday ruled in a constitutional interpretation
that the move by the Taipei District Court to switch the judges in its trial of
Chen's case was "constitutional."</P>
      <P>"Although many people may be unhappy with the result, we still have to respect
the (judicial) system, " Hsieh said while attending the inauguration of a
campaign office for the Democratic Progressive Party's nominee in December's
Changhua County magistrate election.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court decided late last year to have a three-judge panel led
by Tsai Shou-shun take charge of all cases involving the ex-president, instead
of the original panel hearing his case headed by Cho Chan-shun.</P>
      <P>Chen was indicted on several charges, including receiving bribes, money
laundering and embezzlement.</P>
      <P>The Taipei court said it decided to change judges because the Tsai panel was
responsible for the trial of Wu Shu-jen, Chen's wife, who was indicted on
charges of illegally siphoning NT$104 million from the president's discretionary
state affairs fund while her husband was in office, and that combining the cases
of Chen and Wu was appropriate.</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife were given life sentences and fines of NT$200 million and
NT$300 million respectively by the Taipei court on Sept. 11. They have both
appealed the verdict.</P>
      <P>The court's move prompted Chen to petition the Council of Grand Justices for an
interpretation on whether the change in judges was unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>Tsai, who on Dec. 31 ruled to detain Chen after taking into account the
seriousness of the crimes committed by the former president, and the possibility
that he might flee or collude with witnesses, have since then repeatedly acted
to keep Chen in custody.</P>
      <P>The Council also ruled that although detaining defendants because they committed
serious crimes is not unconstitutional, judges should also take into account
flight risks and the possibility of colluding with witnesses and other criteria,
to better protect the defendants' rights.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen and Chen Shui-bian's office Friday expressed regret
over the Council's constitutional interpretation, claiming it failed to clarify
the issue or end disputes.</P>
      <P>Chen's office asked the judges hearing his appeal to consider releasing him
while the appeal is being heard.</P>

      <P>Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) said Saturday it is likely that passengers
will be able to pick up tickets at convenience stores instead of train stations
by the Lunar New Year holiday in February 2010.</P>
      <P>THSRC chairman Ou Chin-der said the ticket issuing system at convenience stores
was still in the testing stage and therefore could not be activated by the end
of this year.</P>
      <P>But THSRC will try to achieve the goal by the new year holiday, Ou said in an
interview with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>THSRC said in 2007 it would issue tickets at convenience stores but has failed
to do so to date. According to the Bureau of High Speed Rail, which supervises
the high speed railway, the main obstacle is that the THSRC and convenience
stores have not been able to agree on the fee collected by the stores to provide
the service.</P>
      <P>Since THSRC became operational in 2007, passengers have only been able to pick
up tickets at ticket booths or automatic vending machines in its eight train
stations around the country.</P>
      <P>With more than 9,000 convenience stores on the island, Taiwan has among the
highest densities of convenience stores of any country in Asia, rivaled only by
Japan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) said it will try to achieve
the same goal of allowing passengers to collect their tickets at convenience
stores by mid-2010.</P>
      <P>Chang Ying-huei, deputy managing director of the TRA, said it will open a tender
for the ticket issuing system by the end of this year. If everything goes
smoothly, the system will start operations about four months after the tender's
winner is decided.</P>

holiday that marks the end of Ramadan, which ended Sept. 20 this year.</P>
      <P>Ramadan is a Muslim religious observance that takes place during the ninth month

anything from dawn until sunset. Fasting is meant to teach patience, sacrifice

      <P>Taiwan's top 10 brands of fine rice were unveiled Saturday at a ceremony
presided over by Council of Agriculture (COA) Minister Chen Wu-hsiung.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the ceremony held in the Taipei World Trade Center, Chen hailed the
high quality of locally grown rice and urged the public to consume more of it at
a time when the traditional dietary staple is gradually disappearing from the
regular meals of many Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>Farmers who were honored for their rice brands included Hsu Neng-fa from Miaoli
County, Chen Long-an and Tseng Yun-chung from Taichung County, Chang Mao-sheng
from Changhua County and Tsai Sheng-ping from Yunlin County, as well as others
from Chiayi, Tainan, Yilan, Hualien and Taitung counties.</P>
      <P>A 26-year-old woman, Cheng Shu-lin, was the youngest and the only female among
the 10 winners.</P>
      <P>A rice exposition was held at the same venue as the awards ceremony, with
farmers' associations displaying a wide range of rice-based products, such as
ice cream, cakes, facial masks, snacks, and cleaning products.</P>
      <P>In 2006, each Taiwan citizen consumed an average of 48 kilograms of rice per
year, 10.8 kgs. less than the average 10 years earlier, and 50 percent less than
in 1982, government statistics show.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently consumes about 1.3 million tons of rice each year, and exports
some 500 tons every year to countries such as Japan, Hong Kong, Canada and
Singapore.</P>

      <P>Former Vice President Lien Chan will be named as the special envoy of President
Ma Ying-jeou to the leaders summit of the 2009 Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum slated for Nov. 12-14 in Singapore, sources close to the president said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office is expected to announce the appointment after completing
consultations on related details with the host country, the sources said.</P>
      <P>This will be the second consecutive year that Lien, who is an honorary chairman
of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) , represents Taiwan at the APEC leaders summit.</P>
      <P>Lien also attended last year's summit held in Peru, which made him the highest-
ranking former Republic of China official ever allowed to take part in the
annual summit.</P>
      <P>Addressing the KMT's 18th National Congress after being sworn in as the party's
chairman Saturday morning, President Ma said Lien's attendance at the 2008 APEC
summit helped enhance Taiwan's status and image and that he expects Lien to

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou reiterated Saturday that his ruling Kuomintang (KMT) will
sell off its assets and halt all of its business operations, leaving election
campaigns to be financed by fund-raising activities.</P>
      <P>After formally becoming KMT chairman at the party's 18th National Congress, Ma
promised that the party would put forth a final plan by the end of the year on
how to handle the party's assets.</P>
      <P>He promised that after selling Central Investment Holding Co., the KMT would
keep only enough money needed to fund party worker pensions and day-to-day
expenses and development, with the rest being donated to charity.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen contended,
however, that the KMT's assets belong to the country rather than to the party
and should be returned to Taiwan's people.</P>
      <P>The KMT's assets have been the subject of persistent attacks by the DPP and
other opposition figures. They believe the party illicitly accumulated the
assets when the lines between it and the state were blurred.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Denmark's top envoy to Taiwan praised the country Saturday for demonstrating its
commitment to combatting climate change, not only through its intention to
attend a crucial meeting on the issue in Copenhagen in December but also with
policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      <P>Flemming Aggergaard, director of the Trade Commission of Denmark in Taipei, told
the Central News Agency that these efforts are important because "it shows that
Taiwan understands the situation."</P>
      <P>"They also show how they (Taiwan and the other countries) are willing to follow
up after the results in Copenhagen and make sure that changes will happen so
that the environment will benefit, " Aggergaard said.</P>
      <P>The international community will gather in Copenhagen in December to decide on
the future depth of reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by working out a new
international climate change agreement before the Kyoto Protocol expires in
2012.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will send a delegation comprised of members from the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA), the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Industrial Technology
Research Institute (ITRI) to attend the Copenhagen meeting in the capacity of a
nongovernmental organization.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan produces around 1 percent of the world's total greenhouse gas
emissions, Aggergaard said that the number is high relative to the island's
relatively small population of 23 million people.</P>
      <P>"This is why it is also important that the (Taiwan) authorities have agreed and
accepted that and decided to do something about it, " Aggergaard said.</P>
      <P>A top-level official of the MOFA told the CNA that by formulating policies and
taking an active role in complying with the world's standards on reducing
greenhouse gas emissions, Taiwan is sending the international community a clear
message that it is committed to global efforts on climate change mitigation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Steeped in history, boat burning festival as big a draw as ever</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/17/09  19:19:28
(With reports by Kuo Chi-hsuan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The tradition of burning Wang Yeh's boat has persisted for 300 years, but the
100,000 people who flocked to the fishing port of Donggang in Pingtung County
for this year's eight-day  ritual demonstrated that the attachment to the local
deity has only grown stronger with time.</P>
      <P>The Donggang Wang Yeh festival, the largest temple activity of its kind in
Taiwan, came to its dramatic conclusion at around 5: 30 a.m. on Oct. 17 when
Wang Yeh's boat went up in flames, taking with it local evil spirits and
worshippers' problems.</P>
      <P>The ceremony's somber atmosphere reflected the area's deep-seated belief in this
local "god of pestilence, " whose ability to ward off evil has grown to near
mythic proportions.</P>
      <P>"It was out of fear and ignorance over plagues, typhoid, cholera and malaria
that people in the past put their faith in the god, thinking he can expel deadly
diseases, " says Lin Mao-hsien, an assistant professor of Taiwanese culture and
language at National Taichung University.</P>
      <P>Even today, Wang Yeh, who is believed to be a divine emissary patrolling the
world for the celestial realm, is evoked to expel the H1N1 virus, Lin says.</P>
      <P>This year's festival was the most expensive ever, with the management of the
more than 300-year-old Donglong Temple that runs the event estimating its cost
at NT$1 billion, 20 percent higher than the previous festival in 2006.</P>
      <P>Hank Lin, a Kaohsiung resident who spent the night standing on the beach waiting
for the boat to be burned, was attending the boat burning ceremony for the
second time. He was willing to sacrifice sleep to be there because of the
tradition and his own faith.</P>
      <P>"I believe in Wang Yeh. Since I was in junior high school, I've begun believing
in this faith. In many points of my life, I believe Wang Yeh was there to help
me. It's not just for expelling diseases."</P>
      <P>That faith in the deity over the centuries has been derived from "the desire for
peace and health, the punishment of evil and rewarding the good, along with
strong community cohesion formed around fear-based belief," Lin Mao-hsien
explained.</P>
      <P>Community cohesion has been particularly important because it has made Donggang
natives proud to be from the town along Taiwan's southwest coast.</P>
      <P>Local researcher Chen Chien-chien says that no matter how far away Donggang
natives move, they also return to fulfill their inherited obligations in the
triennial ceremony run by the more than 300-year-old Donglong Temple.</P>
      <P>Full-time residents also put aside their daily jobs to get involved in various
tasks, including building Wang Yeh's boat and helping organize specific rituals
related to the festival.</P>
      <P>"I'd feel bad if I did not get involved in this, particularly during the rituals
of evoking and seeing off Wang Yeh, " said 41-year-old Su Po-wen, who has served
in the festival as a "Ban Tou" -- the title of public officials responsible for
maintaining order during the rituals -- since he was five years old.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the Wang Yeh ceremony was initiated by seven communities of
early settlers in Donggang centuries ago and some of their descendants still
handle the same tasks in the traditional ceremony today.</P>
      <P>Huang Feng-chi, 61, said he inherited his job as a sedan carrier from his
grandfather at the age of six and has done the same job since then. He sees the
job as an honor that will earn him Wang Yeh's direct blessing.</P>
      <P>The eight-day festival opened this year as always with a mysterious and
complicated ritual on the beach of Jhenhai Park. Five Wang Yeh gods joined the
one enshrined at the temple for a four-day procession around Donggang before
they boarded their wooden ship on which they "sailed" around the fishing port's
streets to expel evil spirits and plagues.</P>
      <P>On the seventh day, the temple offered the gods a feast of 108 Chinese dishes
accompanied by fine wine and liquor to thank them for warding off evil during
the processions over the previous week.</P>
      <P>The ritual culminated on Oct. 17 when the elaborately carved wooden boat was set
on fire to symbolize the Wang Yehs setting off to heaven, taking with them the
evil spirits and diseases they absorbed during the processions.</P>
      <P>After Saturday's ceremony, there was only silence. No gongs and drums were
allowed to make a sound, nor were bells, drums, local opera music or fireworks
permitted, to prevent the "the gods from returning to Donggang" Chen said.</P>
      <P>He explained that any festive sounds might have misled the Wang Yehs into
thinking that the worshippers actually wanted them -- and the evil spirits
leaving with them -- to stay.</P>
      <P>Also, no fishing activities will be allowed in the three days following the
ceremony to "prevent fishing boats from colliding with Wang Yeh's boat, " Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Each ritual was performed strictly according to tradition because any planned
change must have the permission of Wang Yeh, said Donglong Temple chief
executive Hsiao Chih-lin.</P>
      <P>Like the Goddess of Mercy Matsu, Wang Yeh is one of Taiwan's most worshipped
local gods, particularly along the southwest coast. Thousands of Wang Yeh
temples dot the region, with several hundred situated in Pingtung alone where
most people live on fishing and agriculture, according to National Taichung
University's Lin.</P>
      <P>The worship of Wang Yeh can be traced back to the Song Dynasty, Lin says. People
in warm, muggy areas of southern China, where plagues often killed large groups
of people, decided to make model junks out of wood, straw and paper and then set
them out to sea or on rivers to symbolize sending away evil and disease.</P>
      <P>When inhabitants of southern China emigrated to Taiwan in the late 16th and 17th
centuries, they replicated the tradition to safeguard their health and peace of
mind.</P>
      <P>Because the symbolic  vessels they built were regarded as transporters of evil
spirits and disease spreaders, no one would go near them while they were being
taken to the water for them to drift away.</P>
      <P>When the ships failed to sink in the seas and drifted back to a local beach,
local residents felt compelled to pick them up and build a temple to enshrine
the gods of pestilence or perform worshipping rituals to comfort them.</P>
      <P>If the rule was not strictly followed, the people would face severe punishment
from the bad-tempered gods, which could result in the annihilation of their
entire village.</P>
      <P>As time passed, the great fear of disasters waned as the lives of the Wang Yeh
worshippers improved and their populations increased. The tradition of letting
Wang Yeh's boats drift away in the water evolved into burning them to avoid
creating panic in neighboring villages.</P>
      <P>Lin Mao-hsien believes that the feeling of ambivalence mixed with respect and
fear consolidated the belief in Wang Yeh in coastal fishing villages.</P>
      <P>"Thanks to the desire for peace of mind and many reported successful cases of
the gods' blessings, the triennial Donglong Temple's Wang Yeh festival has
expanded a little more each time."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Respect grand justices' constitutional interpretation: Hsieh</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh called on the public Saturday to respect a
constitutional interpretation related to former President Chen Shui-bian's case
to ensure the rule of law in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Council of Grand Justices on Friday ruled in a constitutional interpretation
that the move by the Taipei District Court to switch the judges in its trial of
Chen's case was "constitutional."</P>
      <P>"Although many people may be unhappy with the result, we still have to respect
the (judicial) system, " Hsieh said while attending the inauguration of a
campaign office for the Democratic Progressive Party's nominee in December's
Changhua County magistrate election.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court decided late last year to have a three-judge panel led
by Tsai Shou-shun take charge of all cases involving the ex-president, instead
of the original panel hearing his case headed by Cho Chan-shun.</P>
      <P>Chen was indicted on several charges, including receiving bribes, money
laundering and embezzlement.</P>
      <P>The Taipei court said it decided to change judges because the Tsai panel was
responsible for the trial of Wu Shu-jen, Chen's wife, who was indicted on
charges of illegally siphoning NT$104 million from the president's discretionary
state affairs fund while her husband was in office, and that combining the cases
of Chen and Wu was appropriate.</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife were given life sentences and fines of NT$200 million and
NT$300 million respectively by the Taipei court on Sept. 11. They have both
appealed the verdict.</P>
      <P>The court's move prompted Chen to petition the Council of Grand Justices for an
interpretation on whether the change in judges was unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>Tsai, who on Dec. 31 ruled to detain Chen after taking into account the
seriousness of the crimes committed by the former president, and the possibility
that he might flee or collude with witnesses, have since then repeatedly acted
to keep Chen in custody.</P>
      <P>The Council also ruled that although detaining defendants because they committed
serious crimes is not unconstitutional, judges should also take into account
flight risks and the possibility of colluding with witnesses and other criteria,
to better protect the defendants' rights.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen and Chen Shui-bian's office Friday expressed regret
over the Council's constitutional interpretation, claiming it failed to clarify
the issue or end disputes.</P>
      <P>Chen's office asked the judges hearing his appeal to consider releasing him
while the appeal is being heard.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THSRC may allow ticket pick-up at convenience stores by Feb 2010</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) said Saturday it is likely that passengers
will be able to pick up tickets at convenience stores instead of train stations
by the Lunar New Year holiday in February 2010.</P>
      <P>THSRC chairman Ou Chin-der said the ticket issuing system at convenience stores
was still in the testing stage and therefore could not be activated by the end
of this year.</P>
      <P>But THSRC will try to achieve the goal by the new year holiday, Ou said in an
interview with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>THSRC said in 2007 it would issue tickets at convenience stores but has failed
to do so to date. According to the Bureau of High Speed Rail, which supervises
the high speed railway, the main obstacle is that the THSRC and convenience
stores have not been able to agree on the fee collected by the stores to provide
the service.</P>
      <P>Since THSRC became operational in 2007, passengers have only been able to pick
up tickets at ticket booths or automatic vending machines in its eight train
stations around the country.</P>
      <P>With more than 9,000 convenience stores on the island, Taiwan has among the
highest densities of convenience stores of any country in Asia, rivaled only by
Japan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) said it will try to achieve
the same goal of allowing passengers to collect their tickets at convenience
stores by mid-2010.</P>
      <P>Chang Ying-huei, deputy managing director of the TRA, said it will open a tender
for the ticket issuing system by the end of this year. If everything goes
smoothly, the system will start operations about four months after the tender's
winner is decided.</P>

      <P>The Czech Economic and Cultural Office in Taiwan opened a photo exhibition
Saturday to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Iron Curtain.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, which is being held at National Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall until
Nov. 29, features 70 posters highlighting the themes "A Europe of Values and
Ideas, " "20th Anniversary of the Fall of the Iron Curtain," and "Czech Gems."</P>
      <P>Jaroslav Dolecek, representative of the Czech Economic and Cultural Office in
Taiwan, said at the opening of the exhibition that this exhibition presents the
remarkable stories of some of the brave Czech people who attempted both
successfully and unsuccessfully to escape to the free world before the Iron
Curtain fell.</P>
      <P>"This should remind us all how important it is to be courageous and to keep
striving for democracy and for our individual freedoms, " Dolecek said.</P>
      <P>Vice Foreign Minister David Lin said that 1989 was a momentous year in European
history because of the nonviolent Velvet Revolution, which started in Prague
that year and later led to the overthrow of Communist governments in
Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria.</P>
      <P>"This exhibition offers the general public in Taiwan a glimpse into this period
of upheaval, and refreshes our memories of unselfish sacrifice and of a struggle
for international solidarity," Lin said.</P>
      <P>"It also revives our aspirations to preserve the democratic way of life and to
strive for freedom," he added.</P>

holiday that marks the end of Ramadan, which ended Sept. 20 this year.</P>
      <P>Ramadan is a Muslim religious observance that takes place during the ninth month
of the Islamic calendar, during which participating Muslims do not eat or drink
anything from dawn until sunset. Fasting is meant to teach patience, sacrifice

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top 10 brands of fine rice were unveiled Saturday at a ceremony
presided over by Council of Agriculture (COA) Minister Chen Wu-hsiung.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the ceremony held in the Taipei World Trade Center, Chen hailed the
high quality of locally grown rice and urged the public to consume more of it at
a time when the traditional dietary staple is gradually disappearing from the
regular meals of many Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>Farmers who were honored for their rice brands included Hsu Neng-fa from Miaoli
County, Chen Long-an and Tseng Yun-chung from Taichung County, Chang Mao-sheng
from Changhua County and Tsai Sheng-ping from Yunlin County, as well as others
from Chiayi, Tainan, Yilan, Hualien and Taitung counties.</P>
      <P>A 26-year-old woman, Cheng Shu-lin, was the youngest and the only female among
the 10 winners.</P>
      <P>A rice exposition was held at the same venue as the awards ceremony, with
farmers' associations displaying a wide range of rice-based products, such as
ice cream, cakes, facial masks, snacks, and cleaning products.</P>
      <P>In 2006, each Taiwan citizen consumed an average of 48 kilograms of rice per
year, 10.8 kgs. less than the average 10 years earlier, and 50 percent less than
in 1982, government statistics show.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently consumes about 1.3 million tons of rice each year, and exports
some 500 tons every year to countries such as Japan, Hong Kong, Canada and
Singapore.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT to help Taiwan continue developing ties with China: Ma</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  18 (CNA)
10/18/09  16:19:53
(By Y.L. Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday after assuming control of his ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) the previous day that the party will support the continuing
development of cross-Taiwan Strait ties as Taiwan inevitably maintains
appropriate relations with China in the future.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the party's 18th Central Advisory Council meeting, Ma reiterated
that the improvement of ties with China has had a significant impact on Taiwan
and that maintaining bilateral relations would be an indispensable part of
Taiwan's future development.</P>
      <P>Though there is still room for debate over how close Taiwan's relations with
China should be, there is no doubt that ties must be developed, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma also reiterated his support for using the "1992 Consensus" to "uphold basic
constitutional principles while developing cross-strait relations."</P>
      <P>The "1992 Consensus" refers to a supposed understanding reached during a meeting
in Hong Kong in 1992 between Taiwanese and Chinese representatives, under which
both sides acknowledged that there was only one China, with each side having its
own interpretation of that "one China" means.</P>
      <P>With thawing cross-strait relations over the past year giving people on both
sides of the strait hope for the future, "we hope the peaceful development  will
continue,  and the KMT will extend appropriate support for that development," Ma
said.</P>
      <P>Ma cited for example improved economic prospects created by closer economic ties
with China, pointing to an announcement Saturday by Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company Ltd. (TSMC) Chairman Morris Chang that the company will
pay each employee a special bonus equivalent to half-a-month's pay in November.</P>
      <P>Chang praised Ma for making an important contribution  to normalizing cross-
strait ties, which he said could create more opportunities for local businesses.</P>
      <P>"This is quite a great achievement, which I appreciate very much," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Ma said the government had adopted a moderate policy to cope with the financial
tsunami and economic recession to allow Taiwan's economy to rebound gradually.
He predicted the country's economic indicators would move into positive
territory in the fourth quarter this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Trend-setting concerts held at war relic for cross-strait peace</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen, Oct.18 (CNA)
10/18/09  18:18:47
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two special concerts were staged in a hidden waterway in Kinmen Sunday to mark
the 60th anniversary of the Battle of Kuningtou, in which Kuomintang forces
fought off invading Chinese communists to maintain control of the outlying
island.</P>
      <P>The  first-ever  concerts  on  the  waterway  in  the war-relic-turned-tourist
attraction  Zhaishan  Tunnel  featured performances by five musicians who wanted
to convey their hopes for lasting peace in the Taiwan Strait and an end to war
around the globe.</P>
      <P>Cellist Chang Cheng-chieh, soprano Lin Hui-chen, flutist Wu Chung-hsien,
violinist Chiang Chih-yi and harpist Hung Chi-mei either performed solo or
presented famous classics together on a floating stage that shuttled around the
A-shaped waterway in the tunnel.</P>
      <P>Each of the two concerts drew an audience of about 250 people packed onto a
walkway surrounding the waterway.</P>
      <P>Members of the audience were thrilled to have had the opportunity to be present
at the unprecedented musical performances.</P>
      <P>"I feel I'm so lucky to be able to enjoy music in this special setting. I
believe it is the first time in the world that a concert has taken place in such
an underground tunnel, " said an excited audience member.</P>
      <P>Chang, who performed on his 319-year-old Ruggieri cello, said he was amazed by
the marvelous acoustics during the concerts, which he described as "much, much
better" than what he had expected.</P>
      <P>"I have only one word -- terrific -- to portray today's concerts, " an emotional
Chang said, adding that he is determined to give another concert at the venue
next year.</P>
      <P>Sunday's  repertoire  forcused  on gentle,  delightful  and sentimental pieces,
as Chang said he wanted to turn the Zhaishan Tunnel into a romantic Venice-like
heaven.</P>
      <P>The concerts began with Gounod's "Ave Maria, " Saint-Saens' "The Swan - Carnival
of the Animals, " and Creisler's "Liebesleid" and ended with the pleasing melody
of Offenbach's "Barcarolle."</P>
      <P>Located  in the southwestern  part of Kinmen Island,  the underground Zhaishan
Tunnel -- about 100 meters long, 6 meters wide and 3.5 meters high -- is
connected to the Taiwan Strait, allowing water to flow in.</P>
      <P>Its waterway has a pier allowing small boats to dock.</P>
      <P>The tunnel performances followed a concert given by the Taipei Symphony
Orchestra at the Kinmen County Stadium the previous night, also to commemorate
the Battle of Kuningtou.</P>
      <P>The battle took place Oct. 25-27, 1949, when nearly 10,000 communist troops in
200 ships invaded the frontline island, which lies just kilometers off the coast
of China, as a prelude to seizing Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the ensuing fierce three-day battle, the invaders were utterly routed, losing
nearly 4,000 soldiers, with another 5,200 captured. The defeat brought a 10-year
halt to Beijing's attempts to take Kinmen, and consequently Taiwan, by force.</P>
      <P>In 1958, the communists began a protracted bombardment of Kinmen, but again
failed to seize any part of the island.</P>
      <P>With cross-strait relations improving, the number of Taiwanese troops stationed
in Kinmen has been largely reduced and the island has gradually been transformed
into a tourist stronghold, with war sites becoming major tourist draws.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Fate of planned DRAM company will be clearer Oct. 20: official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 18 (CNA)
10/18/09  19:10:13

    <TEXT>
      <P>The fate of a government plan to set up a company to consolidate Taiwan's ailing
dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chip industry will become clearer on
Tuesday, the deadline for companies to file funding request proposals to join
the company, an official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) proposed forming the state-run Taiwan
Memory Co. (TMC) in March as part of its efforts to restructure and bail out the
local DRAM sector, which was bleeding money at an alarming rate following the
global financial crisis because of oversupply and plummeting demand.</P>
      <P>John Hsuan, honorary vice chairman of United Microelectronics Corp.,  the
world's second-largest custom chipmaker, was named chairman of the company,
which was later renamed Taiwan Innovation Memory Co. (TIMC).</P>
      <P>The creation of the government-backed TMC hoped to secure badly needed core
technologies  and consolidate the fragmented local industry to upgrade the
island's competitiveness in the global DRAM market, which is currently dominated
by South Korean suppliers, according to the official.</P>
      <P>The consolidation plan failed to take root, however, because local DRAM makers
had their own strategies and split into two camps -- one represented by Hsuan-
led TIMC and the other led by Nanya Technology Co.</P>
      <P>TIMC has submitted an operational proposal requesting NT$5 billion in funds from
the government.</P>
      <P>Nanya and Inotera Memories, both affiliated with Taiwan's Formosa Plastics
Group, are still studying the feasibility of taking part in the project and have
yet to file proposals.</P>
      <P>"We will have to wait and see whether they file by Oct. 20, " the MOEA official
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an industry expert questioned the appropriateness of the government
continuing with the project now that the DRAM industry has gradually recovered
and top producers have seen improvements in their balance sheets since early in
the year.</P>
      <P>The government may have also changed its stance on the proposed company. In a
marked departure from its previous unconditional insistence on pushing TIMC
forward, MOEA Minister Shih Yen-shiang said that if the new company does not
promote restructuring in the sector, the government would not support it.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Displaced Tsou tribesmen move into prefab housing units</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  18 (CNA)
10/18/09  19:12:16
(By Huang Kuo-fang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The first batch of prefab housing units delivered to Alishan has been turned
over to 40 aboriginal Tsou families who were displaced from their homes in the
mountainous area during Typhoon Morakot that hit Taiwan in early August.</P>
      <P>The Chiayi County government said the 42 prefab housing units were constructed
by the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China at the 60-kilometer mark of
the Alishan Highway.</P>
      <P>The displaced families moved into 40 prefab housing units while the remaining
two units will serve as the makeshift office of the Red Cross Society,  enabling
it to offer on-the-spot psychological counseling, employment and reconstruction
advice to the victims.</P>
      <P>County government officials said that each of the housing units has a TV,
refrigerator, washing machine, furniture, beds, closets and kitchen equipment
provided by the Red Cross Society. All the Tsou families had to do was move in.</P>
      <P>A traditional Tsou tribe moving-in ceremony, which included praying for
blessings and the unveiling of a plaque, was held with Chiayi County Magistrate
Chen Ming-wen presiding.</P>
      <P>Red Cross Society Secretary-General Chen Shih-kwei and other officials also
attended the ceremony.</P>
      <P>The Tsou tribesmen prepared traditional dishes to share with the guests and sang
"We are a family" to express their appreciation for the reconstruction efforts
made on their behalf.</P>
      <P>Magistrate Chen said that considering the needs of the victims in Alishan
township, the county has actively worked with all sides to choose convenient
places for the construction of prefab housing units.</P>
      <P>"More such prefab housing units will be constructed, " Chen said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) predicted Sunday that people in northern  and
eastern  Taiwan and some mountainous areas in the south should be prepared for
heavy rains starting Oct. 21 due to the combined effects of Typhoon Lupit and a
northeast monsoon.</P>
      <P>Lupit, which was located about 1,380 kilometers east-northeast of Manila at 6
p.m. Sunday, is likely to strengthen into a super typhoon in the coming days,
said CWB forecaster Wang Yao-hua.</P>
      <P>The typhoon, the 20th typhoon in the West Pacific this year, was moving slowly
in a northeasterly direction under the influence of a front, but it is expected
to intensify as it moves faster toward the north of Luzon and the Bashi Channel
on Tuesday, according to Wang.</P>
      <P>The forecaster said it is still too early to predict if Lupit will hit Taiwan,
but the storm's periphery will bring occasional rains to the northern and
eastern parts of Taiwan Oct. 20.</P>
      <P>Downpours from Lupit's periphery and an intensifying northeast monsoon are
expected to start the following day and last until the weekend.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Blind, deaf man uses computer skills to build business, help others</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/18/09  20:28:12
(With reports by H.C. Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>CNA staff writer</P>
      <P>Lu Kuan-liang is like many other young entrepreneurs today, trying to build up
his business by aggressively marketing it online.</P>
      <P>Unlike most of his counterparts, however, he is hearing and visually impaired,
yet he has refused to allow his disabilities hold back his ambitions -- or his
desire to help others.</P>
      <P>With a special computer for the blind, the highly energetic Lu has operated a
massage parlor by vigorously promoting it through its Web site and other
channels while at the same time using his skills to help those who help others.</P>
      <P>Lu, who went completely blind at the age of 6 and became hearing-impaired during
his teenage years, headed to Taipei from his hometown in central Taiwan soon
after graduating from high school at the age of 18 to start a new life,
anticipating that "there are a lot of job and business opportunities in the
capital city."</P>
      <P>Lu and his girlfriend, 25-year-old Shih An-yu, who is also visually impaired,
soon set up a massage stand in night markets in the Taipei suburbs of Banciao
and Sinjhuang, hoping to drum up business.</P>
      <P>They often returned home empty-handed, but undaunted, Lu put to work his
Internet knowledge and skill at using computers for the visually impaired that
he learned in school, launching the Dab Hand Massage Studio with Shih's help and
creating his own blog and a Web site for the studio to market the business.</P>
      <P>He also started a community on the PTT Bulletin Board System -- arguably the
largest BBS in the world with more than 1.5 million registered users -- to
upgrade his operations online and to regularly update information on blind
masseurs around the country.</P>
      <P>His computer is a device with a talking terminal -- a speech synthesizer that
converts text to speech. With hearing aids in both his ears, Lu manages to
"read" the text and lines that appear on the display screen by hearing the
computer speak.</P>
      <P>Over 40,000 people have visited Dab Hand Massage Studio's Web site over the past
three years, helping Lu put his name on the map and the studio's business to
grow steadily, even during the economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Making money, however, is not his only aim.</P>
      <P>"While working to earn a living for myself, I also want to help more blind
people like me, " he told the Central News Agency during an interview at his
home in Sinjhuang.</P>
      <P>Despite their young age, Lu and Shih have demonstrated compassion and empathy
for the disadvantaged or those who go out of their way to help them.</P>
      <P>Via the online bulletin board, they have offered free massages over the past two
years to people who donated their receipts to charity. If the number printed on
the receipt, or uniform invoice, is selected in a monthly drawing, the holder of
the receipt wins a cash prize.</P>
      <P>The couple have also visited nursing homes around the country to chat with the
elderly and give them massages.</P>
      <P>After the devastating Typhoon Morakot that wreaked havoc in southern Taiwan in
August, Lu and Shih also offered free massages to volunteers who helped deliver
goods to the storm's victims or who traveled to the hardest-hit areas to help
clean the environment and take care of evacuees.</P>
      <P>They also donated a month of income to help storm survivors rebuild their homes.</P>
      <P>"I wasn't able to clean up the environment or deliver relief goods. All I could
do is to give massages to my Sinjhuang neighbors who had traveled to southern
Taiwan to work as volunteers in flood-affected areas," Lu said.</P>
      <P>In July, after reading a report from Lanyu (the Orchid Island) about families
who were living below subsistence levels and needed help urgently, Lu headed to
a discount mart and spent NT$10,000 (US$313) on 12 cartons of food and daily
necessities and mailed them to a church in Lanyu.</P>
      <P>"They are the people I want to help, " Lu said. "But currently my higher goal is
to help more of my visually impaired compatriots find jobs," he noted.</P>
      <P>His strategy is to use his talking terminal to start a "house call" massage
service -- hiring unemployed people who can see to transport visually impaired

    <HEADLINE>Riding on success of TV drama, Kaohsiung to step up publicity</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Oct. 18 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung City government hopes to cash in on the star power of a TV drama
series to promote its tourism industry after the production dominated the 2009
Golden Bell Awards, a municipal official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lin Kun-shan, director of the city's Tourism Bureau, made the comment after the
drama series "Black &amp;White" won five Golden Bell awards Friday, including
the most coveted best drama award.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung has encouraged local filmmakers to produce TV programs, movies and
commercials in the city as part of its efforts to enhance its profile and
attract tourists from home and abroad to help inject some vitality into its
sluggish economy.</P>
      <P>The city government has offered considerable administrative and financial
support to Black &amp; White's production team, and many of Kaohsiung's landmark
buildings, including major stations of its new mass rapid transit (MRT) lines,
have been featured in the popular drama series.</P>
      <P>Lin said his bureau has made the drama series a major theme in its tourism
promotion literature and programs since July.</P>
      <P>"A bike tour following the routes that leading Black &amp; White characters have
traveled have drawn large crowds of fans, including many from Hong Kong, before
the onslaught of Typhoon Morakot in early August," Lin said.</P>
      <P>"Riding on the fame brought by the Golden Bell awards to the drama, we will
provide more Black &amp; White-themed tour packages in cooperation with local
hotel operators," Lin said.</P>
      <P>As Chinese tourists have boycotted Kaohsiung over the city's screening of a
documentary featuring the Uighur activist Rebiya Kadeer, the city's tourism
sector has seen its business decline significantly in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>Lin said the city government will step up publicity drives to help its tourism
operators overcome their current plight.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsu Li-ming, director of the city's Department of Information,  said
the municipal government formally set up a filmmaking support center in June.</P>
      <P>To date, he said 16 of the 35 films produced in Taiwan this year have been shot
in Kaohsiung. "Many TV dramas and commercials have also been set and shot in our
city," Hsu said, adding that filmmaking personnel have so far contributed much
to the city's hotel and retail sectors.</P>
      <P>Hsu said his department will come up with complementary publicity programs if
the drama's production team stages promotional activities in other Asian
countries, including Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Malaysia.</P>
      <P>"We believe the series will be shown in other Asian countries, a development
that will definitely give us a windfall in promoting our international image and
tourist industry," Hsu added.</P>
      <P>He estimated that department stores, restaurants and places featured in "Black
&amp; White" saw their revenues grow 30 percent when it was screened earlier
this year on Public Television Service.</P>
      <P>The series is now being broadcast on another network.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by the rewarding results, Hsu said the city government will pull out
all the stops to render assistance and administrative support to film production
teams that are willing to shoot their films in the city.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese universities set sights on Chinese students</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.18  (CNA)
10/18/09  21:05:09
(By Lin Si-yu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Major Taiwanese universities, including those ranked at the top, have stepped up
preparations to attract Chinese students even though the government has yet to
enact related legislation.</P>
      <P>Chinese students cannot obtain any tertiary academic degrees from Taiwanese
institutions at present but are allowed to study at local universities for up to
one year on student exchange programs, with the total number of undergraduate
and graduate students and doctoral candidates not exceeding 1,000.</P>
      <P>Currently,  less than 300 Chinese students study at local universities or
colleges around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Local universities plan to offer scholarships to attract Chinese nationals, but
the Ministry of Education will ban local public academic institutions from
financing the grants with public funds.</P>
      <P>As a result, some prestigious schools, such as National Taiwan University (NTU)
and National Cheng Kung University, are planning to raise funds from private
donors or alumni for scholarships they hope will lure top-notch Chinese
students.</P>
      <P>"To enhance our competive edge in the world, it is important that we attract
outstanding students, including those from China, to study at our campus, " said
NTU Chief Secretary Liao Hsien-hao.</P>
      <P>"To realize that goal, we have to raise funds from the private sector to set up
scholarships for Chiense students, as financial incentives could be an important
appeal."</P>
      <P>Regardless of the incentives local schools offer, they will not be able to allow
Chinese nationals to enroll for full-time study until next September.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) has referred to the Legislative Yuan a draft
package of amendments to the University Act that would pave the way for Chinese
students to pursue academic degrees in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But even if the Legislative Yuan passes it in the present legislative session,
the government would still need another six months of preparations before the
doors could be opened to Chinese students pursuing a degree.</P>
      <P>According to MOE officials, China has about 10 million senior high school
graduates  intending  to enroll  in colleges  or universities, but its tertiary
education institutions can accommodate only about 5 million hopefuls.</P>
      <P>As a result, South Korea and Japan have launched all-out efforts to attract
Chinese students and many local schools are also following suit.</P>
      <P>MOE officials said Chinese students now account for 60 percent of foreign
students in Japanese tertiary institutions and 70 percent of foreign students in
South Korea.</P>
      <P>To uplift Taiwan's national competitivess and disseminate its values of
democracy and freedom, the officials said Chinese students should be welcome to
study in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT to help Taiwan continue developing ties with China: Ma</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  18 (CNA)
10/18/09  16:19:53

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday after assuming control of his ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) the previous day that the party will support the continuing
development of cross-Taiwan Strait ties as Taiwan inevitably maintains
appropriate relations with China in the future.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the party's 18th Central Advisory Council meeting, Ma reiterated
that the improvement of ties with China has had a significant impact on Taiwan
and that maintaining bilateral relations would be an indispensable part of
Taiwan's future development.</P>
      <P>Though there is still room for debate over how close Taiwan's relations with
China should be, there is no doubt that ties must be developed, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma also reiterated his support for using the "1992 Consensus" to "uphold basic
constitutional principles while developing cross-strait relations."</P>
      <P>The "1992 Consensus" refers to a supposed understanding reached during a meeting
in Hong Kong in 1992 between Taiwanese and Chinese representatives, under which
both sides acknowledged that there was only one China, with each side having its
own interpretation of that "one China" means.</P>
      <P>With thawing cross-strait relations over the past year giving people on both
sides of the strait hope for the future, "we hope the peaceful development  will
continue,  and the KMT will extend appropriate support for that development," Ma
said.</P>
      <P>Ma cited for example improved economic prospects created by closer economic ties
with China, pointing to an announcement Saturday by Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company Ltd. (TSMC) Chairman Morris Chang that the company will
pay each employee a special bonus equivalent to half-a-month's pay in November.</P>
      <P>Chang praised Ma for making an important contribution  to normalizing cross-
strait ties, which he said could create more opportunities for local businesses.</P>
      <P>"This is quite a great achievement, which I appreciate very much," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Ma said the government had adopted a moderate policy to cope with the financial
tsunami and economic recession to allow Taiwan's economy to rebound gradually.
He predicted the country's economic indicators would move into positive
territory in the fourth quarter this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Trend-setting concerts held at war relic for cross-strait peace</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen, Oct.18 (CNA)
10/18/09  18:18:47
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two special concerts were staged in a hidden waterway in Kinmen Sunday to mark
the 60th anniversary of the Battle of Kuningtou, in which Kuomintang forces
fought off invading Chinese communists to maintain control of the outlying
island.</P>
      <P>The  first-ever  concerts  on  the  waterway  in  the war-relic-turned-tourist
attraction  Zhaishan  Tunnel  featured performances by five musicians who wanted
to convey their hopes for lasting peace in the Taiwan Strait and an end to war
around the globe.</P>
      <P>Cellist Chang Cheng-chieh, soprano Lin Hui-chen, flutist Wu Chung-hsien,
violinist Chiang Chih-yi and harpist Hung Chi-mei either performed solo or
presented famous classics together on a floating stage that shuttled around the
A-shaped waterway in the tunnel.</P>
      <P>Each of the two concerts drew an audience of about 250 people packed onto a
walkway surrounding the waterway.</P>
      <P>Members of the audience were thrilled to have had the opportunity to be present
at the unprecedented musical performances.</P>
      <P>"I feel I'm so lucky to be able to enjoy music in this special setting. I
believe it is the first time in the world that a concert has taken place in such
an underground tunnel, " said an excited audience member.</P>
      <P>Chang, who performed on his 319-year-old Ruggieri cello, said he was amazed by
the marvelous acoustics during the concerts, which he described as "much, much
better" than what he had expected.</P>
      <P>"I have only one word -- terrific -- to portray today's concerts, " an emotional
Chang said, adding that he is determined to give another concert at the venue
next year.</P>
      <P>Sunday's  repertoire  forcused  on gentle,  delightful  and sentimental pieces,
as Chang said he wanted to turn the Zhaishan Tunnel into a romantic Venice-like
heaven.</P>
      <P>The concerts began with Gounod's "Ave Maria, " Saint-Saens' "The Swan - Carnival
of the Animals, " and Creisler's "Liebesleid" and ended with the pleasing melody
of Offenbach's "Barcarolle."</P>
      <P>Located  in the southwestern  part of Kinmen Island,  the underground Zhaishan
Tunnel -- about 100 meters long, 6 meters wide and 3.5 meters high -- is
connected to the Taiwan Strait, allowing water to flow in.</P>
      <P>Its waterway has a pier allowing small boats to dock.</P>
      <P>The tunnel performances followed a concert given by the Taipei Symphony
Orchestra at the Kinmen County Stadium the previous night, also to commemorate
the Battle of Kuningtou.</P>
      <P>The battle took place Oct. 25-27, 1949, when nearly 10,000 communist troops in
200 ships invaded the frontline island, which lies just kilometers off the coast
of China, as a prelude to seizing Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the ensuing fierce three-day battle, the invaders were utterly routed, losing
nearly 4,000 soldiers, with another 5,200 captured. The defeat brought a 10-year
halt to Beijing's attempts to take Kinmen, and consequently Taiwan, by force.</P>
      <P>In 1958, the communists began a protracted bombardment of Kinmen, but again
failed to seize any part of the island.</P>
      <P>With cross-strait relations improving, the number of Taiwanese troops stationed
in Kinmen has been largely reduced and the island has gradually been transformed
into a tourist stronghold, with war sites becoming major tourist draws.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Fate of planned DRAM company will be clearer Oct. 20: official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The fate of a government plan to set up a company to consolidate Taiwan's ailing
dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chip industry will become clearer on
Tuesday, the deadline for companies to file funding request proposals to join
the company, an official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) proposed forming the state-run Taiwan
Memory Co. (TMC) in March as part of its efforts to restructure and bail out the
local DRAM sector, which was bleeding money at an alarming rate following the
global financial crisis because of oversupply and plummeting demand.</P>
      <P>John Hsuan, honorary vice chairman of United Microelectronics Corp.,  the
world's second-largest custom chipmaker, was named chairman of the company,
which was later renamed Taiwan Innovation Memory Co. (TIMC).</P>
      <P>The creation of the government-backed TMC hoped to secure badly needed core
technologies  and consolidate the fragmented local industry to upgrade the
island's competitiveness in the global DRAM market, which is currently dominated
by South Korean suppliers, according to the official.</P>
      <P>The consolidation plan failed to take root, however, because local DRAM makers
had their own strategies and split into two camps -- one represented by Hsuan-
led TIMC and the other led by Nanya Technology Co.</P>
      <P>TIMC has submitted an operational proposal requesting NT$5 billion in funds from
the government.</P>
      <P>Nanya and Inotera Memories, both affiliated with Taiwan's Formosa Plastics
Group, are still studying the feasibility of taking part in the project and have
yet to file proposals.</P>
      <P>"We will have to wait and see whether they file by Oct. 20, " the MOEA official
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an industry expert questioned the appropriateness of the government
continuing with the project now that the DRAM industry has gradually recovered
and top producers have seen improvements in their balance sheets since early in
the year.</P>
      <P>The government may have also changed its stance on the proposed company. In a
marked departure from its previous unconditional insistence on pushing TIMC
forward, MOEA Minister Shih Yen-shiang said that if the new company does not
promote restructuring in the sector, the government would not support it.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The first batch of prefab housing units delivered to Alishan has been turned
over to 40 aboriginal Tsou families who were displaced from their homes in the
mountainous area during Typhoon Morakot that hit Taiwan in early August.</P>
      <P>The Chiayi County government said the 42 prefab housing units were constructed
by the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China at the 60-kilometer mark of
the Alishan Highway.</P>
      <P>The displaced families moved into 40 prefab housing units while the remaining
two units will serve as the makeshift office of the Red Cross Society,  enabling
it to offer on-the-spot psychological counseling, employment and reconstruction
advice to the victims.</P>
      <P>County government officials said that each of the housing units has a TV,
refrigerator, washing machine, furniture, beds, closets and kitchen equipment
provided by the Red Cross Society. All the Tsou families had to do was move in.</P>
      <P>A traditional Tsou tribe moving-in ceremony, which included praying for
blessings and the unveiling of a plaque, was held with Chiayi County Magistrate
Chen Ming-wen presiding.</P>
      <P>Red Cross Society Secretary-General Chen Shih-kwei and other officials also
attended the ceremony.</P>
      <P>The Tsou tribesmen prepared traditional dishes to share with the guests and sang
"We are a family" to express their appreciation for the reconstruction efforts
made on their behalf.</P>
      <P>Magistrate Chen said that considering the needs of the victims in Alishan

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) predicted Sunday that people in northern  and
eastern  Taiwan and some mountainous areas in the south should be prepared for
heavy rains starting Oct. 21 due to the combined effects of Typhoon Lupit and a
northeast monsoon.</P>
      <P>Lupit, which was located about 1,380 kilometers east-northeast of Manila at 6
p.m. Sunday, is likely to strengthen into a super typhoon in the coming days,
said CWB forecaster Wang Yao-hua.</P>
      <P>The typhoon, the 20th typhoon in the West Pacific this year, was moving slowly
in a northeasterly direction under the influence of a front, but it is expected
to intensify as it moves faster toward the north of Luzon and the Bashi Channel
on Tuesday, according to Wang.</P>
      <P>The forecaster said it is still too early to predict if Lupit will hit Taiwan,
but the storm's periphery will bring occasional rains to the northern and
eastern parts of Taiwan Oct. 20.</P>
      <P>Downpours from Lupit's periphery and an intensifying northeast monsoon are
expected to start the following day and last until the weekend.</P>

      <P>CNA staff writer</P>
      <P>Lu Kuan-liang is like many other young entrepreneurs today, trying to build up
his business by aggressively marketing it online.</P>
      <P>Unlike most of his counterparts, however, he is hearing and visually impaired,
yet he has refused to allow his disabilities hold back his ambitions -- or his
desire to help others.</P>
      <P>With a special computer for the blind, the highly energetic Lu has operated a
massage parlor by vigorously promoting it through its Web site and other
channels while at the same time using his skills to help those who help others.</P>
      <P>Lu, who went completely blind at the age of 6 and became hearing-impaired during
his teenage years, headed to Taipei from his hometown in central Taiwan soon
after graduating from high school at the age of 18 to start a new life,
anticipating that "there are a lot of job and business opportunities in the
capital city."</P>
      <P>Lu and his girlfriend, 25-year-old Shih An-yu, who is also visually impaired,
soon set up a massage stand in night markets in the Taipei suburbs of Banciao
and Sinjhuang, hoping to drum up business.</P>
      <P>They often returned home empty-handed, but undaunted, Lu put to work his
Internet knowledge and skill at using computers for the visually impaired that
he learned in school, launching the Dab Hand Massage Studio with Shih's help and
creating his own blog and a Web site for the studio to market the business.</P>
      <P>He also started a community on the PTT Bulletin Board System -- arguably the
largest BBS in the world with more than 1.5 million registered users -- to
upgrade his operations online and to regularly update information on blind
masseurs around the country.</P>
      <P>His computer is a device with a talking terminal -- a speech synthesizer that
converts text to speech. With hearing aids in both his ears, Lu manages to
"read" the text and lines that appear on the display screen by hearing the
computer speak.</P>
      <P>Over 40,000 people have visited Dab Hand Massage Studio's Web site over the past
three years, helping Lu put his name on the map and the studio's business to
grow steadily, even during the economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Making money, however, is not his only aim.</P>
      <P>"While working to earn a living for myself, I also want to help more blind
people like me, " he told the Central News Agency during an interview at his
home in Sinjhuang.</P>
      <P>Despite their young age, Lu and Shih have demonstrated compassion and empathy
for the disadvantaged or those who go out of their way to help them.</P>
      <P>Via the online bulletin board, they have offered free massages over the past two
years to people who donated their receipts to charity. If the number printed on
the receipt, or uniform invoice, is selected in a monthly drawing, the holder of
the receipt wins a cash prize.</P>
      <P>The couple have also visited nursing homes around the country to chat with the
elderly and give them massages.</P>
      <P>After the devastating Typhoon Morakot that wreaked havoc in southern Taiwan in
August, Lu and Shih also offered free massages to volunteers who helped deliver
goods to the storm's victims or who traveled to the hardest-hit areas to help
clean the environment and take care of evacuees.</P>
      <P>They also donated a month of income to help storm survivors rebuild their homes.</P>
      <P>"I wasn't able to clean up the environment or deliver relief goods. All I could
do is to give massages to my Sinjhuang neighbors who had traveled to southern
Taiwan to work as volunteers in flood-affected areas," Lu said.</P>
      <P>In July, after reading a report from Lanyu (the Orchid Island) about families
who were living below subsistence levels and needed help urgently, Lu headed to
a discount mart and spent NT$10,000 (US$313) on 12 cartons of food and daily
necessities and mailed them to a church in Lanyu.</P>
      <P>"They are the people I want to help, " Lu said. "But currently my higher goal is
to help more of my visually impaired compatriots find jobs," he noted.</P>
      <P>His strategy is to use his talking terminal to start a "house call" massage
service -- hiring unemployed people who can see to transport visually impaired
masseurs or masseuses via motorbike to the residences of customers who ordered a
massage online.</P>
      <P>"The business would benefit both the blind and those who can see," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Riding on success of TV drama, Kaohsiung to step up publicity</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Oct. 18 (CNA)
10/18/09  20:33:58
(By Cheng Chi-feng and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung City government hopes to cash in on the star power of a TV drama
series to promote its tourism industry after the production dominated the 2009
Golden Bell Awards, a municipal official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lin Kun-shan, director of the city's Tourism Bureau, made the comment after the
drama series "Black &amp;White" won five Golden Bell awards Friday, including
the most coveted best drama award.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung has encouraged local filmmakers to produce TV programs, movies and
commercials in the city as part of its efforts to enhance its profile and
attract tourists from home and abroad to help inject some vitality into its
sluggish economy.</P>
      <P>The city government has offered considerable administrative and financial
support to Black &amp; White's production team, and many of Kaohsiung's landmark
buildings, including major stations of its new mass rapid transit (MRT) lines,
have been featured in the popular drama series.</P>
      <P>Lin said his bureau has made the drama series a major theme in its tourism
promotion literature and programs since July.</P>
      <P>"A bike tour following the routes that leading Black &amp; White characters have
traveled have drawn large crowds of fans, including many from Hong Kong, before
the onslaught of Typhoon Morakot in early August," Lin said.</P>
      <P>"Riding on the fame brought by the Golden Bell awards to the drama, we will
provide more Black &amp; White-themed tour packages in cooperation with local
hotel operators," Lin said.</P>
      <P>As Chinese tourists have boycotted Kaohsiung over the city's screening of a
documentary featuring the Uighur activist Rebiya Kadeer, the city's tourism
sector has seen its business decline significantly in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>Lin said the city government will step up publicity drives to help its tourism
operators overcome their current plight.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsu Li-ming, director of the city's Department of Information,  said
the municipal government formally set up a filmmaking support center in June.</P>
      <P>To date, he said 16 of the 35 films produced in Taiwan this year have been shot
in Kaohsiung. "Many TV dramas and commercials have also been set and shot in our
city," Hsu said, adding that filmmaking personnel have so far contributed much
to the city's hotel and retail sectors.</P>
      <P>Hsu said his department will come up with complementary publicity programs if
the drama's production team stages promotional activities in other Asian
countries, including Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Malaysia.</P>
      <P>"We believe the series will be shown in other Asian countries, a development
that will definitely give us a windfall in promoting our international image and
tourist industry," Hsu added.</P>
      <P>He estimated that department stores, restaurants and places featured in "Black
&amp; White" saw their revenues grow 30 percent when it was screened earlier
this year on Public Television Service.</P>
      <P>The series is now being broadcast on another network.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by the rewarding results, Hsu said the city government will pull out
all the stops to render assistance and administrative support to film production
teams that are willing to shoot their films in the city.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese universities set sights on Chinese students</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.18  (CNA)
10/18/09  21:05:09
(By Lin Si-yu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Major Taiwanese universities, including those ranked at the top, have stepped up
preparations to attract Chinese students even though the government has yet to
enact related legislation.</P>
      <P>Chinese students cannot obtain any tertiary academic degrees from Taiwanese
institutions at present but are allowed to study at local universities for up to
one year on student exchange programs, with the total number of undergraduate
and graduate students and doctoral candidates not exceeding 1,000.</P>
      <P>Currently,  less than 300 Chinese students study at local universities or
colleges around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Local universities plan to offer scholarships to attract Chinese nationals, but
the Ministry of Education will ban local public academic institutions from
financing the grants with public funds.</P>
      <P>As a result, some prestigious schools, such as National Taiwan University (NTU)
and National Cheng Kung University, are planning to raise funds from private
donors or alumni for scholarships they hope will lure top-notch Chinese
students.</P>
      <P>"To enhance our competive edge in the world, it is important that we attract
outstanding students, including those from China, to study at our campus, " said
NTU Chief Secretary Liao Hsien-hao.</P>
      <P>"To realize that goal, we have to raise funds from the private sector to set up
scholarships for Chiense students, as financial incentives could be an important
appeal."</P>
      <P>Regardless of the incentives local schools offer, they will not be able to allow
Chinese nationals to enroll for full-time study until next September.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) has referred to the Legislative Yuan a draft
package of amendments to the University Act that would pave the way for Chinese
students to pursue academic degrees in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But even if the Legislative Yuan passes it in the present legislative session,
the government would still need another six months of preparations before the
doors could be opened to Chinese students pursuing a degree.</P>
      <P>According to MOE officials, China has about 10 million senior high school
graduates  intending  to enroll  in colleges  or universities, but its tertiary
education institutions can accommodate only about 5 million hopefuls.</P>
      <P>As a result, South Korea and Japan have launched all-out efforts to attract
Chinese students and many local schools are also following suit.</P>
      <P>MOE officials said Chinese students now account for 60 percent of foreign
students in Japanese tertiary institutions and 70 percent of foreign students in
South Korea.</P>
      <P>To uplift Taiwan's national competitivess and disseminate its values of
democracy and freedom, the officials said Chinese students should be welcome to
study in Taiwan.</P>

1987: Wall Street experiences the worst day in its history, known as "Black
Monday," with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeting a record 508.32

almost 10 percent greater than the stock market crash of 1929, which heralded
the Great Depression.

enthusiasm in providing assistance to Taiwan's earthquake victims.

      <P>Taiwan won nine gold, 13 silver and two bronze medals at the British Invention
Show 2009 that ended Saturday, scoring the highest winning rate among the 17
countries that participated in the exhibition.</P>
      <P>All 24 entries submitted by Taiwan won prizes at the exhibition, which is the
UK's largest innovation and technology expo.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's gold medal-winning inventions include an integrated Bluetooth and
landline telecommunication system,  an artificial translucent stone with pearl
luster, an on-vehicle surveillance camera/security mirror, a safe cane for the
blind, a ball collecting device and a step-on compression litter bin.</P>
      <P>The integrated Bluetooth and landline telecommunication system scored instant
marketing success, as British Telephone (BT) placed an initial order worth
NT$800 million (US$24.77 million) with its inventor, Cotron Corp., Saturday.</P>
      <P>The invention had previously won a gold medal at the 37th International
Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva in April this year.</P>
      <P>The pearl-luster artificial stone drew the attention of British interior
designers, who made extensive inquiries with its inventor, Rong Jih Enterprise,
during the show.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  all five  sets of the on-vehicle  surveillance cam/security mirror
that were displayed at the exhibition were sold out during the show. The device,
which was designed with the hope it would be adopted for use on the London
subway, was developed by a research team from National Formosa University in
Yunlin County.</P>
      <P>Kan Kramer, a serial inventor and founder of the British Inventors Society,
praised the exhibits from Taiwan, describing them as "refined and mature."</P>
      <P>He said of all the interesting and exquisite Taiwanese entries, he personally
liked the on-vehicle surveillance cam/security mirror the best.</P>
      <P>It was the second time that Taiwanese inventors were taking part in the show,
which was held this year Oct. 14-17 in London at Alexandra Palace where the
awards were also presented Saturday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NT$100m earmarked for industries threatened by Taiwan-China pact</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has set aside NT$100 million (US$3.09
million) to help industries that are likely to be affected by the proposed
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) next year with China, Minister
of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said Monday.</P>
      <P>The signing of the cross-Taiwan Strait economic pact could affect up to
80,000-100,000 Taiwanese workers, but considering the number of jobs that it
would help to create, Taiwan is expected to see a net increase of 260,000 jobs,
Shih said on the sidelines of a meeting of a Legislative Yuan committee.</P>
      <P>He said the Executive Yuan has asked MOEA and the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA)
to allocate more funds to deal with the imminent situation, and that the MOEA
has already put aside NT$100 million this year.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs has earmarked NT$35 billion for subsidies to
3,740 businesses that are likely to be affected by the ECFA, he said.</P>
      <P>CLA Minister Wang Ju-hsuan said last week that the council hopes affected
workers would also be eligible to receive assistance, and noted that it would
require an additional NT$10 billion to fund such subsidies for up to six months.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said last Friday that the ECFA will bring the greatest
benefits to the petrochemical,  machinery and textile industries, creating a
total of 350,000 jobs in these sectors.</P>
      <P>This will contribute to a net increase of 260,000 jobs after subtracting those
that are expected to be lost in the porcelain tile, home electrical appliance
and towel industries, which are likely to be threatened by the liberalization of
cross- strait trade, Wu said.</P>

      <P>The Presidential Office said Monday it will announce the name of President Ma
Ying-jeou's envoy to the leaders summit of the 2009 Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum after the host country Singapore has been formally informed of
the selection.</P>
      <P>According to sources close to the president, Kuomintang Honorary Chairman and
former Vice President Lien Chan will be named as Ma's special envoy to the APEC
summit that will be held Nov. 12-14 in Singapore.</P>
      <P>In keeping with past practice, the Presidential Office will announce the name
after it has formally notified Singapore via a special envoy who will return to
Taiwan soon, said Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi.</P>
      <P>In August, Singapore sent a special envoy to Taipei to deliver an invitation to
President Ma to attend this year's APEC forum. The Singaporean envoy is expected
to return to Taiwan soon to ascertain who will represent Taiwan at the summit.</P>
      <P>"This procedure shows respect for the host country," Wang added.</P>
      <P>If Lien is selected, he will be representing President Ma at the APEC leaders'
summit for the second consecutive year.</P>
      <P>Political observers said that Taiwan's choice of envoy to APEC this year will be
seen a litmus test for cross-strait relations and a chance to strengthen
Taiwan-U.S. relations, as he or she will have the opportunity to meet U.S.
President Barack Obama and Chinese President Hu Jintao.</P>

      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) said Monday that Typhoon Lupit has been
strengthening and that it could bring extremely torrential rain to northeastern
Taiwan's Yilan County Thursday and Friday.</P>
      <P>According to the weather bureau, the typhoon was centered some 1,450 km east-
northeast of the Philippines capital of Manila as of 8 a.m. Monday, moving in a
west-northwesterly direction at 16 kph.</P>
      <P>The storm was gaining strength and had been upgraded to the level of a strong
typhoon, the weather bureau said.</P>
      <P>The CWB meteorologists forecast that due to the combined effect of the typhoon
and the seasonal northeasterly monsoon, rainfall in northern  and eastern
regions of Taiwan would begin Wednesday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Although, the typhoon might not hit Taiwan directly, extremely torrential rain
-- which is classified as 350 mm of precipitation in 24 hours -- is likely to
affect Yilan County and mountainous northern areas Thursday and Friday, the
forecasters warned.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Volunteer holidays to clean environment become a hot trend</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/19/09  16:40:29</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Working holidays have long had a following in Taiwan, but environmentally
oriented working vacations have become the new fad in recent years, with growing
numbers of people choosing to spend their days off with their sleeves rolled up
working the land.</P>
      <P>Just recently, Capital Engineering Corp. (CEC) turned a company outing into an
eco-working holiday for the first time, with the company's vice general manager,
Shih Chi-yuan, leading 12 employees to volunteer at Yangmingshan National Park
in suburban Taipei.</P>
      <P>They took part in a program that has been organized by the Taiwan Environmental
Information Association (TEIA) every weekend from May to September over the past
five years to rid Yonglai Ecological Park of goose grass, an invasive alien
species, and Leersia hexandra, a dominant native grass, and preserve the
ecological balance of Yangmingshan's Lengshueikeng wetlands.</P>
      <P>Wearing wetsuits, they waded through the muddy wetlands and quickly found out
how difficult it was to pull their legs from the sticky mud.</P>
      <P>"It was more difficult pulling my legs from the mud than weeding out the grass,
" Shih said in an interview. "Only now have I come to realize how invasive this
pan-tropical species is and why it is so difficult to tame."</P>
      <P>Because environmental engineering is part of CEC's core business, Shih has often
read in environmental impact assessments how invasive aquatic plants encroach on
the habitats of indigenous species.</P>
      <P>But "through this volunteer service, we got first-hand experience and saw for
ourselves how goose grass has affected local aquatic plant growth, " Shih said.</P>
      <P>"In the future, we will use more eco-friendly and environmentally sound thinking
when preparing environmental impact assessments for our customers."</P>
      <P>CEC employee Hu Wen-hsing introduced the eco-working holiday program to Shih and
other colleagues after being a participant for three years.</P>
      <P>"We white-collar workers usually spend a lot of time in the office. The eco-
working holiday program allows us to get closer to the soil and Mother Nature, "
said the 20-something Hu. "You will be amazed by nature's strength and
wonders... and be driven to do more for it."</P>
      <P>The working holiday concept is not new. Taiwan has long had groups of volunteers
use their leisure time to build bridges for financially strapped townships or
repair houses for disadvantaged families.</P>
      <P>Eco-working holidays, however, focus on doing something for the environment.
Participants usually have to engage in manual labor, such as tree planting,
cleaning up scenic areas in the mountains or perhaps taking part in community
beautification projects.</P>
      <P>The TEIA took the initiative to introduce the eco-working holiday program to
Taiwan in August 2004.</P>
      <P>In its initial project, it enlisted volunteers from home and abroad to help
build an artificial wetland to recycle wastewater and plant millet in the
Taiping ecological farm along the famous Lijia Trail in eastern Taiwan's Taitung
County.</P>
      <P>The project  also entailed  bird watching,  river tracing, participation in
aboriginal festival celebrations and visits to prehistorical tribal sites.</P>
      <P>Sun Hsiu-ju, a TEIA department director, said the program allows participants to
become involved in local natural settings and culture, experience nature, relax
the body and mind, and help the natural environment.</P>
      <P>In the five years since the program's launch, the TEIA has organized  different
types of eco-working  holidays geared to maintained ecological balance in
diverse natural habitats, Sun says.</P>
      <P>More than 1,000 people have taken part in the programs, which have included
protecting sand in the Chiku wetlands in Tainan County, using traditional eco-
friendly building techniques to restore a historic tobacco facility in Hualien
County, and repairing and painting the walls of rundown buildings on the
outlying Orchid Island.</P>
      <P>This past summer, the association collaborated with the Taiwan Marine
Environmental Education Association and Academia Sinica's Biodiversity Research
Center to attack a new target: Taiwan's coral reefs.</P>
      <P>The group enlisted  diving volunteers  to work with local communities in
northeastern Taiwan, Green Island, Orchid Island, Siaoliouciou, Penghu County
and Taitung County's Shanyuan Beach in conducting underwater coral reef checks
and collecting data to help locals gain a better understanding of area waters.</P>
      <P>"All of our programs take a great deal of work... but the hardships have not
daunted the participants, " Sun says. "The number of people choosing this form
of vacation and registering for our programs has been increasing steadily."</P>
      <P>Given Taiwan's vulnerability to natural calamities, such as earthquakes and
typhoons, Sun said she believes there is still ample room for Taiwan to champion
environmental volunteerism through various well-designed eco-working holiday
options.</P>
      <P>In fact, some government agencies and private organizations have followed suit
in getting up similar opportunities.</P>
      <P>Lin Wen-min, director of the Kenting National Park's Nanjenshan mountain station
in southern Taiwan, said her office organized six two-day-one-night eco-working
holiday packages between August and September that attracted 137 volunteers to
clean up garbage in the park's Chufengpi protected area on the southeastern tip
of the Hengchun peninsula.</P>
      <P>The seven kilometers of coastline, which can only be reached by foot, are
shrouded in mystery because members of the public are barred from entry without
prior permission.</P>
      <P>The area boasts unusually shaped reef rock formations and biodiversity, but it
is often polluted by marine waste swept onto the beach by high waves.</P>
      <P>Each volunteer had to walk two to three hours to reach the beach and picked up
an average of two bags of marine trash, which originated from sources resembling
a "mini-United Nations," including China, Hong Kong and even Malaysia, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Despite the hardship, the reaction to the inaugural beach cleanup holiday
package was more enthusiastic than expected.</P>
      <P>"Ten senior high school students took part in the program along with their
parents, who encouraged their children's participation to enhance their
environmental awareness and altruism," Lin said.</P>
      <P>The package had some other more conventional perks, including a guided
ecological tour around the biologically diverse national park at night and a
stay in an eco-friendly inn offering a taste of the local cuisine, and Lin
believes this type of venture has the potential to generate more than simply
environmental benefits.</P>
      <P>"As well as providing a new vacation option, the working holiday also offers new
promise in helping revitalize local economies."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan never offered coast oceanographic data to Beijing: officials</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  19 (CNA)
10/19/09  16:48:22

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan government has denied an accusation by an opposition lawmaker that it
presented Beijing with coastal oceanographic data on Taiwan and thereby reduced
the island's status to a province of China.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi on Monday said the accusation  by
Legislator  Chai  Trong-Rong  of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was
unfounded.</P>
      <P>Wang said it is regrettable that a politician would start rumors to mislead the
public and dent the morale of government officials.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan Secretary-General Lin Join-sane said in response to media
questions on the issue that Taiwan did not pass on any coastal oceanographic
data to Beijing. In Taiwan, there are certain restrictions that apply to
research findings, he added.</P>
      <P>The media questions revolved around a local newspaper report earlier in the day
on Chai's accusation that National Security Council (NSC) Secretary-General Su
Chi had instructed an oceanic monitoring team under the Ministry of the Interior
(MOI) to hand over data on Taiwan's seabed and reefs to its Chinese counterpart.</P>
      <P>Chai claimed that over the past five years, monitoring vessels from China have
been spotted frequently in waters around Taiwan taking measurements and
collecting other data that they said would be used as reference in the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan government offered China data on Taiwan's seabed and reefs, including
classified information, in exchange for Beijing's support for Taiwan's bid to
join international bodies, Chai was quoted as saying in the report.</P>
      <P>Given that the lawmaker made the accusation in the media rather than in the
Legislative Yuan, NSC officials said, the council would probably bring a lawsuit
against him.</P>
      <P>Asked what the charges would be, the officials said they were "still discussing
that."</P>
      <P>In response to Chai's claims, MOI Vice Minister Chien Tai-Lang said he never
received any directive  to offer that type of information to China, and that
there are no such instructions in place, according to the news report.</P>
      <P>The pro-independent DPP has been critical of the cross-Taiwan Strait policies of
President Ma Ying-jeou's administration.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Monday:</P>
      <P>Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>China policy, DPP's feet of clay</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party held its national congress Sunday
afternoon, vowing to restore the party's clean image.</P>
      <P>We are glad the party is emerging from the shadow of ex-president Chen Shui-bian
who is standing trial for corruption, but the DPP lacks initiative in its China
policy. Its only approach is to criticize that of the ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Also, it lacks a vision for the island in terms of politics, the economy,
military, finance and science.</P>
      <P>The party seems not to realize that the election culture in the country is
changing after two consecutive transitions of power, and the DPP has not come up
with any policies  that take  into consideration the new political situation.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Prosecutor general's term should be guaranteed</P>
      <P>A newly-elected member of the Kuomintang's Central Standing Committee vowed to
get rid of Prosecutor-General Chen Tsung-ming by pushing for a law amendment
that would allow for the dismissal of unimpartial prosecutors general.</P>
      <P>We share the member's view that Chen has failed to live up to public
expectations, but we take issue with the idea of removing unimpartial
prosecutors general by any means.</P>
      <P>The fixed term for the prosecutor general is meant to shield him from any
interference and to enable him to investigate any crimes committed by senior
officials, without fear or favor.</P>
      <P>This approach has to take precedence over any public dislike of a particular
person who happens to be the country's chief prosecutor, and he could hardly be
expected to carry out his duties impartially if he not protected by law.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Ma's chairmanship of KMT signals misery for Taiwan people</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou  took over the helm of the ruling Kuomintang(KMT) on
Saturday, a move that we can forecast signals misery for the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>If past events are any indication, the more power Ma has, the greater the
disaster he produces.</P>
      <P>After two terms as mayor, he left his successor a mess at Taipei City Hall.</P>
      <P>When he previously served as KMT chairman between 2005 and 2007, he failed to
deliver on his promise to dispose of the party's controversial assets.</P>
      <P>He wants to double as chairman of the KMT, which he claims has not fully
supported his administration's policies.</P>
      <P>He also intends to set the stage for political negotiations with China through
the party, and push the island onto the path of eventual unification with China.</P>
      <P>We can therefore predict that Ma's assumption of control of the KMT apparatus
spells misery for the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Ma still has a long way to go to reform KMT</P>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou reassumed leadership of the Kuomintang Sunday after four years.</P>
      <P>He promised to push for party reform, clean governance and diligent performance
of political duties.</P>
      <P>The promises are similar to those he made but failed to fulfill during his first
term as party chairman.</P>
      <P>Four years ago, he was not held to his promises, as he quit the position one
year before his term expired due to his indictment for alleged misuse of public
funds.</P>
      <P>The major dereliction was his failure to dispose of KMT assets before 2008, as
promised.</P>
      <P>Now that Ma had taken over the party's helm again he will have to follow through
on his promises soon because the electorate's patience is running out.</P>

    <HEADLINE>`Green taxes' will be imposed gradually: vice premier</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 2 (CNA)
10/19/09  18:09:48
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Eric Lilun Chu said Monday that if the government decides to begin
levying "green taxes," including a carbon dioxide tax, they will be imposed
gradually.</P>
      <P>Speaking after a meeting on energy and environment taxes at the Ministry of
Finance, Chu, who doubles as convener of the Executive Yuan's Tax Reform
Commission, said the administration is likely to go ahead with the plan, as
protecting the Earth is "a common wish of all the people in the country."</P>
      <P>However, he went on, the amounts taxed will not be heavy at the beginning  to
avoid disturbing  the economics of the nation's households or the operations of
the business and industrial sectors.</P>
      <P>The vice premier declined to speculate on when exactly the green taxes will
begin to be levied, saying that a relevant law will first need to be passed to
serve as the legal basis for their implementation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Finance Minister Lee Sush-der said at a Legislative Yuan
interpellation session that the main goal of imposing such taxes is to increase
the cost of goods for consumers in the hope that they will adjust their
consumption behavior, which will in turn help cut greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      <P>Lee said the green taxes are expected to be levied in 2011 at the earliest.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the session, Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said
that a version of the planned energy tax that has been drafted by the Ministry
of Economic Affairs (MOEA) is much more "lenient" than one drafted by the
Ministry of Finance.</P>
      <P>"Lower or more lenient rates for the energy tax have been recommended in a bid
to reduce the effect on the international competitiveness of Taiwanese
industries and the consumption standards of the general consumer," Shih noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Minister of Finance Chang Sheng-ford said the energy tax and a
carbon tax, which are part of the planned environment tax, will be the first to
be levied, as consensus on them has already been reached by relevant government
agencies.</P>
      <P>"We expect that draft bills on the two taxation plans will be passed into law by
the Legislative Yuan by next year, paving the way for their implementation in
2011," Chang said.</P>
      <P>The energy tax will be imposed on gasoline, diesel, kerosene, aviation fuel,
liquefied natural gas, fuel oil and natural gas once an energy tax law has been
passed by the legislature, he added.</P>
      <P>For the environment tax, he said, the ministry intends to push for the
imposition of the carbon tax first, since controversy still exists regarding
other articles included in the environment tax.</P>
      <P>According to a tentative version drafted by the Tax Reform Commission, revenue
from an energy tax could reach NT$164.7 billion (US$5.09 billion) per year by
the 10th year of its imposition, while that expected to be generated from a
carbon tax will top NT$239 billion.</P>
      <P>In addition to the new taxes, other non-taxation methods will also be pushed to
save energy and cut carbon dioxide emissions, including measures to control
emission volumes, Chang added.</P>

      <P>Residents of the offshore Lienchiang County were not only surprised to find out
that some 67,000 people had applied for an online draw to be the county's
"magistrate for a day," but were even more astonished to find out that the
winner was an American.</P>
      <P>Josh Wenger, a New Yorker pursuing his doctoral degree at the National Taiwan
University Graduate Institute of National Development in Taipei, entered the
draw under his Chinese name Wen Chia-shu, so officials were not immediately
aware that the winner was foreign, although the draw was open to every
participant who was able to answer at least eight out of 10 questions on Matsu,
the main island of Lienchiang County.</P>
      <P>Wenger visited Matsu Monday, where he was greeted by the real Lienchiang
magistrate, Chen Hsueh-sheng, now serving his second term in office.</P>
      <P>"Matsu is really beautiful, I hope I can be a special envoy to promote Matsu and
attract more foreigners to visit, " Wenger said in fluent Chinese while
responding to a fake question-and-answer session at County Hall.</P>
      <P>In addition to attending the session, Wenger also visited the county's major
construction sites and sightseeing spots.</P>
      <P>The county's Project Planning Office said the winner of the "magistrate for a
day" contest is required to share his experience of Matsu on the county's Web
site and blog to give more people a better understanding of the changes and
development on Matsu over the years.</P>
      <P>The event, designed to promote Matsu at very limited cost, was declared a
success and the county government will consider a similar event next year,
according to county officials.</P>

      <P>The Presidential Office said Monday that President Ma Ying-jeou will deliver a
speech at a ceremony in Kinmen Sunday to commemorate the battle that kept the
outlying island out of the communists' hands.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said that since the Battle of
Kuningtou was of historical importance, President Ma wanted to visit Kuningtou
in person to highlight the significance of the Kuomintang government's
protection of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Battle of Kuningtou began on Oct. 25, 1949, when Chinese communist warships
carrying over 10,000 troops landed on Kuningtou, located on the northwestern tip
of the main island of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>On Oct. 27, after three days of battle, the nationalist army defeated the
communists after forcing the surrender of thousands of communist troops.</P>
      <P>The victory, which boosted the sagging morale of the nationalist forces, which
were on the retreat after losing the Chinese civil war, frustrated the communist
attempt to take control of Kinmen and its advance toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As part of its campaign to mark the battle, the Ministry of National Defense has
organized several activities leading up to the main event, the opening ceremony
for the Peace Memorial Square on Oct. 25. President Ma will be accompanied by

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan bill sets limits on health insurance for expatriates</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A draft bill to amend Taiwan's National Health Insurance Act would prevent
Taiwanese expatriates or students living or studying overseas from enjoying the
country's health insurance privileges, a Department of Health (DOH) official
said Monday.</P>
      <P>The draft amendment  rules that citizens  whose  household registration in
Taiwan has become invalid because of their long-term absence, must stay in the
country for at least four consecutive months to reclaim their right to join the
National Health Insurance (NHI) system, said Chu Tung-kuang, the deputy convener
of the DOH's NHI planning task force.</P>
      <P>Under existing regulations, Taiwanese citizens who live outside Taiwan for less
than six months a year can continue to be ensured under the health care system
as long as they pay their insurance premium.</P>
      <P>Those who live outside the country for more than six months can have their
insurance suspended to avoid paying premiums, but they are allowed to rejoin the
NHI system as long as they pay the premium upon their return, even if it's for a
short stay, according to the insurance act.</P>
      <P>Chu said many overseas Taiwanese and students studying abroad rejoin the
national insurance plan during their temporary stay in Taiwan to seek the
relatively low-cost medical treatment here. Such practices have triggered public
criticism for unfairly consuming the country's health insurance resources, Chu
added.</P>
      <P>Due to such practices, the DOH has decided to set a barrier to prevent the abuse
of national health insurance resources, Chu said.</P>
      <P>According to Bureau of National Health Insurance statistics, Taiwanese
expatriates' medical treatment here cost the country over NT$100 million (US$3
million) a year while the total premium they had paid amounted to only between
NT$60 million and NT$70 million a year.</P>
      <P>The amendment bill has been delivered to the Legislative Yuan for approval, Chu
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>All air force personnel involved in improperly maintaining a Mirage 2000-5 jet
fighter last month have been disciplined, the Air Force Command Headquarters
said Monday in a statement.</P>
      <P>The Apple Daily reported earlier Monday that a Mirage fighter at the Hsinchu air
base in northern Taiwan suffered an engine breakdown during a high-speed trail
run on a runway Sept. 21 because of faulty maintenance.</P>
      <P>A follow-up examination found that a fuel check valve was mistakenly installed
in the reverse direction in the fighter's fuel system, preventing fuel from
flowing to the aircraft's engine and eventually leading to the plane's
breakdown.</P>
      <P>The Air Force statement neither confirmed  nor denied the newspaper report, but
it acknowledged that the fighter's engine breakdown during "a regular
maintenance test run" was caused by the negligence of both mechanics and flight
staff.</P>
      <P>"Because of their negligence, the fuel delivery system could not operate
normally and ensure a sufficient flow of fuel to the fighter's engine," the
statement said.</P>
      <P>The Air Force blamed the incident on the failure of mechanics to precisely

    <TEXT>
      <P>An amateur astronomer who discovered an asteroid earlier this year presented a
model of his new discovery to Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu Monday to share it with
all residents of the southern Taiwan port city.</P>
      <P>Tsai Yuan-sheng discovered the asteroid along with an assistant at the Lulin
Observatory on Yushan, also known as Jade Mountain, March 20 and tentatively
named it "Kaohsiung" after his hometown.</P>
      <P>In August, the International Astronomical Union's Committee on Small Body
Nomenclature (IAU's CSBN) -- an international organization responsible for the
naming of asteroids and comets -- formally approved the designation and gave
Tsai's discovery a permanent number "215080."</P>
      <P>It was the first asteroid discovered by an amateur Taiwanese astronomy buff to
have won international recognition.</P>
      <P>The asteroid, located between Mars and Jupiter, is similar in size to Kaohsiung
International Airport. At perihelion, the closest point to the sun in its orbit,
the asteroid is 350 million kilometers from the sun and at aphelion, its most
distant point from the sun in its orbit, it is about 450 million kilometers from
the sun.</P>
      <P>It takes about four years for the newly identified asteroid to complete its
orbit around the sun.</P>
      <P>Tsai and Lin Chi-sheng, an astronomical observation assistant at Lulin
Observatory, spotted the asteroid using highly advanced digital equipment.</P>
      <P>Tsai recalled that he first detected that the body could both rotate around its
own axis and circle the Sun and that its position coordinates varied each day.</P>
      <P>"I then took photos of the object consecutively for analytical comparison and
finally came to the conclusion that it was an asteroid that had never been
documented before," Tsai recalled.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, most larger asteroids have been discovered and only small
asteroids that cannot be detected with the naked eye are still left to be
spotted with highly sophisticated instruments.</P>
      <P>Tsai, 40, began to develop his interest in observing the stars while studying at
a military preparatory school as a teenager. At the time, he was required to
stand guard at night, and the long hours with nothing to do led him to fall in
love with stargazing.</P>
      <P>He later dropped out of the naval academy to pursue his hobby more freely. He
now often takes his wife and children high into the mountains to observe the
stars at night.</P>
      <P>Tsai has documented 13 asteroids, but "Kaohsiung" is the only one to have been
recognized by the IAU's CSBN.</P>
      <P>"I was so jubilant to obtain international recognition of my latest discovery
and thus decided to name it 'Kaohsiung' to honor my beloved homeland," Tsai
said.</P>
      <P>"I also want to share my happiness in discovering the new body with all fellow
Kaohsiung residents, " Tsai said at the asteroid model presentation ceremony at
the city's Gangho Elementary School.</P>
      <P>For her part, Mayor Chen said the discovery of the asteroid and its designation
as "Kaohsiung" are not only the "pride of Kaohsiung" but also the "pride of
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Noting that Tsai's achievement has inspired a "star chasing" fad in the city,
Chen said the city government will step up efforts to promote astronomical
education and cultivate more talent in the field.</P>
      <P>Chen said she has directed the city's Bureau of Education to allocate NT$1
million (US$31,056) annually to help finance the operations of the Gangho
Elementary School's astronomy observatory.</P>
      <P>She also proposed that an astronomy-themed science park be established after
Kaohsiung City and Kaohsiung County merge next year.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ching-hua, director of the municipal education bureau, said the discovery
of the asteroid has set a good model for the city's astronomy education and
pledged to study the feasibility of setting up an astronomy theme park in the
new Kaohsiung municipality.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier assures public that energy tax will not be levied soon</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih assured the public Monday that a proposed energy tax will not
be levied soon, saying that "it would be imposed sometime after 2011 at the
earliest."</P>
      <P>Wu made the comment after the Executive Yuan's Tax Reform Commission, convened
by Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu, met to discuss energy and environment tax
proposals and eventually reached a consensus on pushing for an energy tax.</P>
      <P>Wu said the energy tax,  which would be assessed on the consumption of gasoline,
diesel, kerosene, aviation fuel, fuel oil, and natural gas, is currently still
on the drawing board, and that if it is imposed, there will be complementary
measures to ease its sting.</P>
      <P>"The fuel consumption fee and other taxes would be dropped, " the premier said.</P>
      <P>Even if the energy tax is put in place, "it will be a long process, " Wu said,
noting that the consensus reached at the meeting will be considered by related
government agencies and then discussed at public hearings.</P>
      <P>Amendments to existing laws would also have to be screened and approved by the
legislature, he added.</P>
      <P>Chu said participants in Monday's meeting could not reach a consensus on levying
an environment tax, so the commission will first push for an energy tax on
gasoline, based on the principle of not adding to the public's tax burden.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the influential  Chinese National Federation of Industries  (CNFI)
said that without reasonable  complementary measures, there could be an "exodus
of businesses."</P>
      <P>CNFI Chairman Preston Chen said the private sector is not opposed to the
government's plan to levy an energy tax to conserve energy and cut carbon
dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>But he urged the government to consider the country's industrial development and
competitiveness, and especially the approach of its rivals such as China, Japan
and South Korea, in its deliberations over an energy tax.</P>
      <P>"That way, it will mitigate the measure's impact on industry and help maintain
its competitiveness."</P>
      <P>Chen voiced strong opposition to the environment tax, which would focus on
taxing greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      <P>Citing a study conducted by the Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research,
Chen said that even though the proposed carbon tax had been lowered from
NT$2,000 per ton to NT$750 per ton, and projected revenues lowered from NT$800
billion to NT$435.1 billion, preliminary estimates show that manufacturers would
be forced to bear an additional NT$100 billion in higher taxes and electricity
bills.</P>
      <P>Even the energy bill, he argued could have dire consequences because once it is
imposed, businesses that use coal, fuel oil, and electricity will obviously
suffer, and if they cannot pass on the extra costs in the face of international
competition, their survival could be threatened.</P>
      <P>State-run utility Taiwan Power Co. estimated that under the proposed energy tax
plan, electricity costs would rise 40 percent over the next 10 years, to NT$3.54
per kwh.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Domestic aviation traffic continues downward spiral</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's domestic aviation passenger traffic volmue continued its steep decline
last year mainly because of the expansion of high-speed railway services and the
global economic slump, a civil aviation official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) official made the remarks after
legislators criticized southern Taiwan's Pingtung Airport as a white elephant
because of its low utilization rate.</P>
      <P>Except for flight routes linking Taiwan proper to its outlying islands,
passenger volume on all domestic routes began to drop substantially in 1998 when
National Freeway No. 3 was fully completed and opened to traffic.</P>
      <P>The number of passengers slid further in 2003 over a SARS scare and the downward
spiral became even more serious in 2007 when the high-speed railway was
partially opened to traffic, the official said.</P>
      <P>The expansion of high-speed rail services and the onset of the domestic economy
slump amid a global downturn in 2008 further cut into passenger traffic.</P>
      <P>According to CAA tallies, the 10 airports on Taiwan proper handled 40.21 million
passengers in 2006 before the inauguration of the high-speed rail system. That
total fell to 36.3 million in 2007 and to 31.47 million in 2008.</P>
      <P>Noting that the high-speed railway has lured away many air passengers, the
official said local carriers have successively suspended Taipei-Taichung,
Taipei-Chiayi and Taipei-Tainan flight services and the number of flights on the
Taipei-Kaohsiung route, previously one of the world's most traveled routes, has
fallen to three round-trip flights per week.</P>
      <P>In the first seven months of this year, passenger traffic volume handled by
Taiwan proper's 10 airports totaled 17.2 million, a year-on-year decline of 11.6
percent.</P>
      <P>Among them, only Chiayi Airport registered an increase in passenger traffic,
handling 25.5 percent more passengers than a year earlier, while Pingtung
Airport posted the biggest decrease, with passenger volumes falling 79 percent.</P>
      <P>Passenger traffic also fell 56.7 percent at Hengchun Airport, 47.3 percent at
Hualien Airport, 44.5 percent at Tainan Airport, 20.6 percent at Kaohsiung
International Airport, 9.9 percent at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport,  5.6
percent at Taipei Songshan Airport, 3.5 percent at Taichung Airport, and 2.2
percent at Taitung Airport.</P>
      <P>Both Pingtung and Hengchun airports handle only three flights from and to Taipei
each week, the lowest utilization rate among the 10 airports.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of foreign laborers at Taiwan's five export processing zones has
fallen 3.5 percent over the past year, a Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The official from the MOEA's Kaohsiung-based Export Processing Zone (EPZ)
Administration said the five EPZs under its jurisdiction had a total work force
of 55,972 at the end of August, of which 4,257, or 7.6 percent of the total,
were foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>In the same month of 2008, the five EPZs -- Nantze, Kaohsiung, Pingtung,
Taichung and Taichung harbor zone -- had 66,156 workers, with foreign nationals
accounting for 6,584, or 9.9 percent of the total, the official said.</P>
      <P>He attributed the 3.5 percent decline mainly to a global economic downturn that
has also impacted Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Following the ourtbreak of the global financial crisis last fall, the number of
workers at the five EPZs plunged from 66,649 to a low of 54,458 in March this
year, the official said, adding that the number has since rebounded slightly.</P>
      <P>The number of workers on unpaid leave reached a peak of more than 20,000 in
February, but has since declined steadily to 147 in September, the official
said, adding that the figure signaled a rebound in local economic fortunes.</P>

      <P>The Presidential Office said Monday that President Ma Ying-jeou will deliver a
speech at a ceremony in Kinmen Sunday to commemorate the battle that kept the
outlying island out of the communists' hands.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said that since the Battle of
Kuningtou was of historical importance, President Ma wanted to visit Kuningtou
in person to highlight the significance of the Kuomintang government's
protection of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Battle of Kuningtou began on Oct. 25, 1949, when Chinese communist warships
carrying over 10,000 troops landed on Kuningtou, located on the northwestern tip
of the main island of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>On Oct. 27, after three days of battle, the nationalist army defeated the
communists after forcing the surrender of thousands of communist troops.</P>
      <P>The victory, which boosted the sagging morale of the nationalist forces, which
were on the retreat after losing the Chinese civil war, frustrated the communist
attempt to take control of Kinmen and its advance toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As part of its campaign to mark the battle, the Ministry of National Defense has
organized several activities leading up to the main event, the opening ceremony
for the Peace Memorial Square on Oct. 25. President Ma will be accompanied by
Defense Minister Kao Hua-chu at the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Former Kinmen commanders and veterans of the battle have also been invited to
the ceremony to commemorate the battle.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan bill sets limits on health insurance for expatriates</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A draft bill to amend Taiwan's National Health Insurance Act would prevent
Taiwanese expatriates or students living or studying overseas from enjoying the
country's health insurance privileges, a Department of Health (DOH) official
said Monday.</P>
      <P>The draft amendment  rules that citizens  whose  household registration in
Taiwan has become invalid because of their long-term absence, must stay in the
country for at least four consecutive months to reclaim their right to join the
National Health Insurance (NHI) system, said Chu Tung-kuang, the deputy convener
of the DOH's NHI planning task force.</P>
      <P>Under existing regulations, Taiwanese citizens who live outside Taiwan for less
than six months a year can continue to be ensured under the health care system
as long as they pay their insurance premium.</P>
      <P>Those who live outside the country for more than six months can have their
insurance suspended to avoid paying premiums, but they are allowed to rejoin the
NHI system as long as they pay the premium upon their return, even if it's for a
short stay, according to the insurance act.</P>
      <P>Chu said many overseas Taiwanese and students studying abroad rejoin the
national insurance plan during their temporary stay in Taiwan to seek the
relatively low-cost medical treatment here. Such practices have triggered public
criticism for unfairly consuming the country's health insurance resources, Chu
added.</P>
      <P>Due to such practices, the DOH has decided to set a barrier to prevent the abuse
of national health insurance resources, Chu said.</P>
      <P>According to Bureau of National Health Insurance statistics, Taiwanese
expatriates' medical treatment here cost the country over NT$100 million (US$3
million) a year while the total premium they had paid amounted to only between
NT$60 million and NT$70 million a year.</P>
      <P>The amendment bill has been delivered to the Legislative Yuan for approval, Chu
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>All air force personnel involved in improperly maintaining a Mirage 2000-5 jet
fighter last month have been disciplined, the Air Force Command Headquarters
said Monday in a statement.</P>
      <P>The Apple Daily reported earlier Monday that a Mirage fighter at the Hsinchu air
base in northern Taiwan suffered an engine breakdown during a high-speed trail
run on a runway Sept. 21 because of faulty maintenance.</P>
      <P>A follow-up examination found that a fuel check valve was mistakenly installed
in the reverse direction in the fighter's fuel system, preventing fuel from
flowing to the aircraft's engine and eventually leading to the plane's
breakdown.</P>
      <P>The Air Force statement neither confirmed  nor denied the newspaper report, but
it acknowledged that the fighter's engine breakdown during "a regular
maintenance test run" was caused by the negligence of both mechanics and flight
staff.</P>
      <P>"Because of their negligence, the fuel delivery system could not operate
normally and ensure a sufficient flow of fuel to the fighter's engine," the
statement said.</P>
      <P>The Air Force blamed the incident on the failure of mechanics to precisely
follow standard operating procedures in installing parts and components,  and it
said all officers  involved had been disciplined, with punishments ranging from
a reprimand to two demerits.</P>
      <P>The statement also said the Air Force has revised its standard operating
procedures to beef up inspections, mutual checks and supervision to prevent the
recurrence of similar errors.</P>
      <P>Taiwan purchased 60 Mirage fighters from France in the 1990s that form the
backbone of the country's air force arsenal along with U.S.-built F-16s and

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih assured the public Monday that a proposed energy tax will not
be levied soon, saying that "it would be imposed sometime after 2011 at the
earliest."</P>
      <P>Wu made the comment after the Executive Yuan's Tax Reform Commission, convened
by Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu, met to discuss energy and environment tax
proposals and eventually reached a consensus on pushing for an energy tax.</P>
      <P>Wu said the energy tax,  which would be assessed on the consumption of gasoline,
diesel, kerosene, aviation fuel, fuel oil, and natural gas, is currently still
on the drawing board, and that if it is imposed, there will be complementary
measures to ease its sting.</P>
      <P>"The fuel consumption fee and other taxes would be dropped, " the premier said.</P>
      <P>Even if the energy tax is put in place, "it will be a long process, " Wu said,
noting that the consensus reached at the meeting will be considered by related
government agencies and then discussed at public hearings.</P>
      <P>Amendments to existing laws would also have to be screened and approved by the
legislature, he added.</P>
      <P>Chu said participants in Monday's meeting could not reach a consensus on levying
an environment tax, so the commission will first push for an energy tax on
gasoline, based on the principle of not adding to the public's tax burden.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the influential  Chinese National Federation of Industries  (CNFI)
said that without reasonable  complementary measures, there could be an "exodus
of businesses."</P>
      <P>CNFI Chairman Preston Chen said the private sector is not opposed to the
government's plan to levy an energy tax to conserve energy and cut carbon
dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>But he urged the government to consider the country's industrial development and
competitiveness, and especially the approach of its rivals such as China, Japan
and South Korea, in its deliberations over an energy tax.</P>
      <P>"That way, it will mitigate the measure's impact on industry and help maintain
its competitiveness."</P>
      <P>Chen voiced strong opposition to the environment tax, which would focus on
taxing greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      <P>Citing a study conducted by the Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research,
Chen said that even though the proposed carbon tax had been lowered from
NT$2,000 per ton to NT$750 per ton, and projected revenues lowered from NT$800
billion to NT$435.1 billion, preliminary estimates show that manufacturers would
be forced to bear an additional NT$100 billion in higher taxes and electricity
bills.</P>
      <P>Even the energy bill, he argued could have dire consequences because once it is
imposed, businesses that use coal, fuel oil, and electricity will obviously
suffer, and if they cannot pass on the extra costs in the face of international
competition, their survival could be threatened.</P>
      <P>State-run utility Taiwan Power Co. estimated that under the proposed energy tax
plan, electricity costs would rise 40 percent over the next 10 years, to NT$3.54
per kwh.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's domestic aviation passenger traffic volmue continued its steep decline
last year mainly because of the expansion of high-speed railway services and the
global economic slump, a civil aviation official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) official made the remarks after
legislators criticized southern Taiwan's Pingtung Airport as a white elephant
because of its low utilization rate.</P>
      <P>Except for flight routes linking Taiwan proper to its outlying islands,
passenger volume on all domestic routes began to drop substantially in 1998 when
National Freeway No. 3 was fully completed and opened to traffic.</P>
      <P>The number of passengers slid further in 2003 over a SARS scare and the downward
spiral became even more serious in 2007 when the high-speed railway was
partially opened to traffic, the official said.</P>
      <P>The expansion of high-speed rail services and the onset of the domestic economy
slump amid a global downturn in 2008 further cut into passenger traffic.</P>
      <P>According to CAA tallies, the 10 airports on Taiwan proper handled 40.21 million
passengers in 2006 before the inauguration of the high-speed rail system. That
total fell to 36.3 million in 2007 and to 31.47 million in 2008.</P>
      <P>Noting that the high-speed railway has lured away many air passengers, the
official said local carriers have successively suspended Taipei-Taichung,
Taipei-Chiayi and Taipei-Tainan flight services and the number of flights on the
Taipei-Kaohsiung route, previously one of the world's most traveled routes, has
fallen to three round-trip flights per week.</P>
      <P>In the first seven months of this year, passenger traffic volume handled by
Taiwan proper's 10 airports totaled 17.2 million, a year-on-year decline of 11.6
percent.</P>
      <P>Among them, only Chiayi Airport registered an increase in passenger traffic,
handling 25.5 percent more passengers than a year earlier, while Pingtung
Airport posted the biggest decrease, with passenger volumes falling 79 percent.</P>
      <P>Passenger traffic also fell 56.7 percent at Hengchun Airport, 47.3 percent at
Hualien Airport, 44.5 percent at Tainan Airport, 20.6 percent at Kaohsiung
International Airport, 9.9 percent at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport,  5.6
percent at Taipei Songshan Airport, 3.5 percent at Taichung Airport, and 2.2
percent at Taitung Airport.</P>
      <P>Both Pingtung and Hengchun airports handle only three flights from and to Taipei
each week, the lowest utilization rate among the 10 airports.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of foreign laborers at Taiwan's five export processing zones has
fallen 3.5 percent over the past year, a Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The official from the MOEA's Kaohsiung-based Export Processing Zone (EPZ)
Administration said the five EPZs under its jurisdiction had a total work force
of 55,972 at the end of August, of which 4,257, or 7.6 percent of the total,
were foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>In the same month of 2008, the five EPZs -- Nantze, Kaohsiung, Pingtung,
Taichung and Taichung harbor zone -- had 66,156 workers, with foreign nationals
accounting for 6,584, or 9.9 percent of the total, the official said.</P>
      <P>He attributed the 3.5 percent decline mainly to a global economic downturn that
has also impacted Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Following the ourtbreak of the global financial crisis last fall, the number of
workers at the five EPZs plunged from 66,649 to a low of 54,458 in March this
year, the official said, adding that the number has since rebounded slightly.</P>
      <P>The number of workers on unpaid leave reached a peak of more than 20,000 in
February, but has since declined steadily to 147 in September, the official
said, adding that the figure signaled a rebound in local economic fortunes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese amateur astronomer discovers new asteroid</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An amateur astronomer who discovered an asteroid earlier this year presented a
model of his new discovery to Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu Monday to share it with
all residents of the southern Taiwan port city.</P>
      <P>Tsai Yuan-sheng discovered the asteroid along with an assistant at the Lulin
Observatory on Yushan, also known as Jade Mountain, March 20 and tentatively
named it "Kaohsiung" after his hometown.</P>
      <P>In August, the International Astronomical Union's Committee on Small Body
Nomenclature (IAU's CSBN) -- an international organization responsible for the
naming of asteroids and comets -- formally approved the designation and gave
Tsai's discovery a permanent number "215080."</P>
      <P>It was the first asteroid discovered by an amateur Taiwanese astronomy buff to
have won international recognition.</P>
      <P>The asteroid, located between Mars and Jupiter, is similar in size to Kaohsiung
International Airport. At perihelion, the closest point to the sun in its orbit,
the asteroid is 350 million kilometers from the sun and at aphelion, its most
distant point from the sun in its orbit, it is about 450 million kilometers from
the sun.</P>
      <P>It takes about four years for the newly identified asteroid to complete its
orbit around the sun.</P>
      <P>Tsai and Lin Chi-sheng, an astronomical observation assistant at Lulin
Observatory, spotted the asteroid using highly advanced digital equipment.</P>
      <P>Tsai recalled that he first detected that the body could both rotate around its
own axis and circle the Sun and that its position coordinates varied each day.</P>
      <P>"I then took photos of the object consecutively for analytical comparison and
finally came to the conclusion that it was an asteroid that had never been
documented before," Tsai recalled.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, most larger asteroids have been discovered and only small
asteroids that cannot be detected with the naked eye are still left to be
spotted with highly sophisticated instruments.</P>
      <P>Tsai, 40, began to develop his interest in observing the stars while studying at
a military preparatory school as a teenager. At the time, he was required to
stand guard at night, and the long hours with nothing to do led him to fall in
love with stargazing.</P>
      <P>He later dropped out of the naval academy to pursue his hobby more freely. He
now often takes his wife and children high into the mountains to observe the
stars at night.</P>
      <P>Tsai has documented 13 asteroids, but "Kaohsiung" is the only one to have been
recognized by the IAU's CSBN.</P>
      <P>"I was so jubilant to obtain international recognition of my latest discovery
and thus decided to name it 'Kaohsiung' to honor my beloved homeland," Tsai
said.</P>
      <P>"I also want to share my happiness in discovering the new body with all fellow
Kaohsiung residents, " Tsai said at the asteroid model presentation ceremony at
the city's Gangho Elementary School.</P>
      <P>For her part, Mayor Chen said the discovery of the asteroid and its designation
as "Kaohsiung" are not only the "pride of Kaohsiung" but also the "pride of
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Noting that Tsai's achievement has inspired a "star chasing" fad in the city,
Chen said the city government will step up efforts to promote astronomical
education and cultivate more talent in the field.</P>
      <P>Chen said she has directed the city's Bureau of Education to allocate NT$1
million (US$31,056) annually to help finance the operations of the Gangho
Elementary School's astronomy observatory.</P>
      <P>She also proposed that an astronomy-themed science park be established after
Kaohsiung City and Kaohsiung County merge next year.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ching-hua, director of the municipal education bureau, said the discovery
of the asteroid has set a good model for the city's astronomy education and
pledged to study the feasibility of setting up an astronomy theme park in the
new Kaohsiung municipality.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) will not be able to issue child care
subsidies as planned this year or next because of the government's tight
financial situation, Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah said Monday.</P>
      <P>The government does not have the money to fund the program at present, Jiang
admitted, but he said his ministry would consider issuing the subsidies in the
future if the economy recovers.</P>
      <P>Jiang made the comments while answering questions from ruling Kuomintang
Legislator Chiang Nai-Shin on the government's plans to stem a drop in the
country's birth rate.</P>
      <P>The minister said the Executive Yuan proposed many concrete measures in its 2008
population policy white paper, including issuing child care subsidies and
reinforcing a community babysitter system.</P>
      <P>He pointed out, however, that financial hurdles are only one of many factors
affecting couples' willingness to have a child, with the deteriorating natural
environment and social conflicts also playing key roles.</P>
      <P>If these fundamental issues are not resolved, the measures outlined in the white
paper will only have a limited impact on increasing the low birth rate, Jiang
said.</P>
      <P>According to a 2009 survey by the U.S.-based Population Reference Bureau, Taiwan
has the world's lowest fertility rate, with an average of one child per woman.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Former aboriginal affairs head now targets hairy crab aquaculture</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The former head of Taiwan's aboriginal affairs has set his sights on raising
hairy crabs in Hualien County after finding that the high quality water in the
eastern county is ideal for the aquaculture industry.</P>
      <P>"Hairy crab aquaculture will be more lucrative than farming, " Walis Pelin,
former minister of the Council of Indigenous Peoples (CIP), said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Pelin formed an aboriginal company together with some aquaculture experts after
he stepped down from his post in 2007, and the firm established a model crab
farm in Yuli Township, Hualien County, early this year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan began hairy crab aquaculture around three years ago, mainly in western
and southern Taiwan, but after inspecting Hualien's environment with aquaculture
experts, Pelin believed the eastern county was a more viable location.</P>
      <P>"The water quality in the Huatung Valley is good, and the environment  is superb
for the development of the aquaculture industry, especially hairy crab and
sturgeon," he said.</P>
      <P>"After we made sure of the superior water and environmental conditions, we did a
cost analysis and found that demand was strong while the costs were low and the
potential profits high. That's why we've decided to help indigenous peoples
raise hairy crabs there," he said.</P>
      <P>The hairy crab model farm covers about three hectares. The company initially
released 150,000 fries, which have now grown to between three and four taels
(one tael is about 37.5 grams.)</P>
      <P>"The quality of the hairy crabs in Hualien will by no means be inferior to those
raised in western Taiwan, mainly because we have clean water and zero
pollution," Pelin said proudly.</P>
      <P>His model farm is now developing a feed formula and various types of aquatic
plants to boost survival rates and the weight of each crab.</P>
      <P>"A hairy crab has to weigh over five taels to have better market value, " the
former CIP chief said, confident that "the goal could be achieved in around
eight or nine months."</P>
      <P>He said the model farm will transfer aquaculture technology to local indigenous
peoples and devise a cooperation and marketing strategy to help them develop
hairy crab aquaculture farms.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Book about Chinese civil war a big draw at Frankfurt Book Fair</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan-born writer and University of Hong Kong professor Lung Ying-tai's latest
book, titled "Wide Rivers and Seas, Untold Stories of 1949, " proved to be a big
draw at the Frankfurt Book Fair Oct. 14-18.</P>
      <P>Though China has banned all Internet articles and discussions on the book --
published by Taiwan's CommonWealth Magazine and Hong Kong's Cosmos Books in
September -- Chinese publishers and exhibitors at the book fair scrambled to
gain the rights to publish her book in their country.</P>
      <P>Neue Zuercher Zeitung, a major daily newspaper in Switzerland, said in a
commentary Monday that China should be positively surprised by the "small but
attractive" Taiwan pavilion at the book fair, because visitors could realize
that "people will have a future only when there is a past, and emotional debts
from suppressed memories must be repaid."</P>
      <P>That was the essence of Lung's book about how the Chinese communists defeated
Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang troops in a civil war before declaring themselves
the new rulers of China on Oct. 1, 1949, the commentary said.</P>
      <P>It said Lung's speech on the book -- delivered at the book fair Oct. 15 and
titled "Salute to the losers" -- was a touching one.</P>
      <P>"China could learn from Taiwan,  a small island, and the loneliness of Chinese
dissident writers that true greatness comes from the willingness to face defeat
and failure, instead of physical or economic magnificence," it said.</P>
      <P>The German weekly Der Spiegel recently published a report filed by reporter
Juergen Kremb from Taipei that gave a detailed account of Lung's new book,
including why she wrote it and what she felt and discovered during her writing.</P>
      <P>Kremb described the book, which Lung said will hopefully make people in China
and Taiwan abandon long-held  suspicions  and prejudices of each other, as
unarguably the most important book that has been written in the Chinese-language
world in decades.</P>
      <P>He said Lung has not been spooked by the Chinese authorities, who have sheltered
its people from being influenced by the book.</P>
      <P>"Only when you see your enemy's wounds, will you be able to put your gun down, "
he quoted Lung as saying.</P>
      <P>In addition to TV appearances and radio interviews in Germany during the book
fair, Lung made the first of 10 blog reports launched by the Berlin-based daily
Die Tageszeitung, called "the forgotten victims in China."</P>
      <P>Lung's new book tells the story of the Chinese Civil War through the eyes of
ordinary people whose lives were forever changed by the event, focusing on the
many Chinese families that were broken apart by the fighting.</P>

      <P>With the approaching Typhoon Lupit expected to bring torrential rains to the
northern half of Taiwan, Premier Wu Den-yih said Tuesday that military
servicemen will be deployed to disaster-prone areas before the storm arrives.</P>
      <P>Military servicemen will be mobilized and deployed to vulnerable areas 36 hours
before a typhoon land warning is issued to get a better understanding of the
situation and help residents stay calm, Wu said while responding to questions at
the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The premier also indicated that Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau will help the
Philippines set up a weather station on the island of Luzon in the future so
that it can more closely monitor the direction of typhoons in the region and
enhance its ability to forecast storms' paths.</P>
      <P>Wu had visited the weather bureau Monday morning to be briefed on the
approaching storm. Weather bureau officials said he was the first premier ever
to visit the bureau prior to a typhoon land warning being issued.</P>
      <P>According to the weather bureau's latest forecast Tuesday, Typhoon Lupit has
been downgraded to a medium-strength typhoon, but it could still bring extremely
heavy rain to eastern and northeastern Taiwan and to mountainous areas in
northern Taiwan on Thursday and Friday.</P>
      <P>The typhoon was centered some 1,140 kilometers east-southeast of the
southernmost tip of Taiwan as of 2 a.m. Tuesday and was moving in a westerly
direction at 17 kph.</P>
      <P>Forecasters said that downpours from Lupit's periphery and an intensifying
northeast monsoon are expected to start dumping rain in eastern and northern
parts of Taiwan on Wednesday.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Tuesday the administration has continued to push the
development of renewable energies in a bid to cut consumption of fossil fuels
and reduce Taiwan's carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>During a hearing at the Legislative Yuan, Wu said the government has promoted
renewable energy development based on three principles -- offering incentives,
allowing renewable energy producers to make profits, and ensuring social
equality.</P>
      <P>Wu was responding to a question from ruling Kuomintang Lee Ching-hua on whether
the administration's plans to impose "green" taxes, including energy and carbon
taxes, were conceived to raise tax revenues or to conserve energy and reduce
green house gas emissions.</P>
      <P>The legislator contended that if the KMT administration was an able government,
it should provide renewable energy options for people to choose from rather than
increasing or levying new taxes to reduce energy consumption.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu reiterated that the government will not begin levying an energy
tax without sound planning and said there is no timetable for the measure at
present.</P>
      <P>The premier said that although the proposed energy tax is commendable and has
been implemented in several industrially advanced countries, the time is not
ripe yet to adopt it in Taiwan, especially "when the domestic economy has just
begun to bottom out from a year-long downturn and the people's lives are still
difficult."</P>
      <P>Wu assured the public on Monday that a proposed energy tax will not be levied
soon.</P>
      <P>He said the energy tax,  which would be assessed on the consumption of gasoline,
diesel, kerosene, aviation fuel, fuel oil, and natural gas, is still on the
drawing board, and that if it is imposed, complementary measures will be adopted
to ease its sting.</P>
      <P>"The fuel consumption fee and other taxes would be dropped, " the premier said.</P>
      <P>Amendments to existing laws would also have to be screened and approved by the
legislature before the tax could be implemented, he added.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Tuesday that President Ma Ying-jeou would meet Chinese
Communist Party Chairman Hu Jintao only with the approval of the Taiwan public
and in an environment of greater trust between the two sides.</P>
      <P>President Ma's guiding principle in cross-Taiwan Strait policy is to safeguard
national sovereignty and advance the people's welfare, therefore, such a meeting
would only take place amid greater mutual goodwill and trust and if there is
consensus among the Taiwan people, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Asked by a legislator to explain on President Ma's statement Monday that he
would not exclude the possibility of meeting with China's leaders, Wu said the
government's cross-strait policies must be implemented at a steady pace over the
long term, rather than being rushed or slowed down.</P>
      <P>For example, Wu said, if the Taiwan government does not allow some enterprises
to set up in China, they may lose their market share. However, enterprises that
move to China too soon may lose their bases in Taiwan and hurt the Taiwan
economy, he added.</P>
      <P>Wu said he cannot project a timetable for any meeting between Ma and Hu, as both
sides have to work to build greater trust and goodwill.</P>
      <P>In addition, if there is no public consensus on the matter, it would be
impossible to talk about a meeting between the two leaders any time soon, he
stressed.</P>
      <P>President Ma, who assumed chairmanship of his ruling Kuomintang (KMT) last
Saturday, told Reuters in an interview Monday that he would not exclude the
possibility of meeting Chinese leaders one day. "I won't exclude that
possibility, but there's no timetable for that yet," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait ties, which were strained when the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party was in power from 2000 to 2008, have warmed up since President
Ma took office in May 2008.</P>

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Tuesday:</P>
      <P>Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>Taiwan a hell for foreign workers</P>
      <P>Five Vietnamese caregivers complained at a news conference that they were
exploited and ill-treated by their bosses at a nursing home for the elderly
where they were employed. They said they were forced to work overtime, were paid
only a fraction of what they were promised and were locked in room.</P>
      <P>This nursing home has really tarnished Taiwan's image as a country that puts a
premium on human rights.</P>
      <P>How can a nursing home that is cruel to its foreign workers be kind to the
senior citizens in its care?</P>
      <P>It is a shame that this has happened in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>We do not understand what Chairman Ma is talking about</P>
      <P>Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou told Reuters that Taiwan is ready to conclude a
trade pact with China in hopes of diversifying Taiwan's export market so that it
not focused entirely on Europe or the United States.</P>
      <P>We really do not understand why Ma would make such remarks. Doesn't he know that
China already absorbs 40 percent of Taiwan's exports.</P>
      <P>Ma also said that he hopes Taiwan could treat China as a market for its products
rather than a factory that manufactures its products for re-export. But is this
something Taiwan can do unilaterally?</P>
      <P>Based on his remarks, Ma must either be lying or is an idiot.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Moving forward with cross-strait ties</P>
      <P>It is now a well-established view that the disputes between Taiwan and China
should be settled by peaceful means.</P>
      <P>China has moved from denying the existence of the Republic of China to
acknowledging its de-facto identity.</P>
      <P>Now both sides should consider the next step, which is acknowledgement of the
fact that there is only one China.</P>
      <P>However, this one China should be neither the Republic of China nor the People's
Republic of China, but something such as a confederate.</P>
      <P>Political pundits may dismiss this idea as absurd but they should consider the
next step because cross-strait relations cannot remain static forever.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>How can judiciary which cannot right its own wrongs right others' wrongs?</P>
      <P>After an investigation, the Control Yuan has asked the Judicial Yuan to
discipline Kinmen District Court president Chao Wen-yuan for sexually harassing
female judges.</P>
      <P>The Anti-corruption  Office of the Judicial  Yuan admitted afterward that it had
looked into the case last year but found no evidence to support the complaints.</P>
      <P>What a pity. The Control Yuan determined the complaints were true while the
Judicial Yuan found a lack of evidence.</P>
      <P>It seems that the judicial system adheres to the principle that people are
innocent until proven guilty only when it probes its own people, motivated by a
desire to keep skeletons in the closet.</P>
      <P>But how can the justice system maintain its credibility and address the
grievances of the people if it cannot address the grievances of its own workers.</P>

      <P>In its negotiations with China on an economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA), Taiwan will maintain its stance of not fully opening its market to
Chinese goods, despite Beijing's complaints about the restrictions, Bureau of
Foreign Trade (BOTF) Director-General Huang Chih-peng said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks one day after China's Ministry of Commerce released a
research report on the proposed cross-Taiwan Strait ECFA, which stated that
Taiwan's current restrictions on cross-strait trade and investment are hampering
the expansion of economic cooperation between the two sides and are unfavorable
to the promotion of the ECFA.</P>
      <P>Huang said he is not surprised at such reports because there are indeed more
than 2,000 items that Taiwan has kept on its restricted list. They include 830
agricultural products and some industrial products, which will remain banned
even after the signing of the ECFA, he said.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has been pushing for the signing of the ECFA with China
in an effort to reduce the impact on Taiwan of the new China-Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) free trade area.</P>
      <P>Critics of the proposed pact, however, argue that it will undermine Taiwan's
sovereignty and unleash a flood of cheap Chinese imports on the Taiwan market
and spur an exodus of capital that will worsen Taiwan's already record high
unemployment.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's most revered local goddess Matsu (or Mazu) will be given a higher
standing as there are plans to designate a day in her honor and include her in
National Day celebrations, Premier Wu Deng-yih said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>During a hearing at the Legislative Yuan, Wu said he will ask the Ministry of
the Interior to study whether the birthday of Matsu -- known as the guardian of
fishermen and sailors and the most popular folk deity in Taiwan -- should be
included as one of the memorial days in the country.</P>
      <P>There are also plans to include the worshipping and culture surrounding the
legendary maiden in National Day celebrations in 2011, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Quoting President Ma Ying-jeou,  Wu said Matsu worshipping originated from China
and has been popular in Taiwan's grass-roots communities, particularly townships
located near the sea.</P>
      <P>It has been fully localized with a strong Taiwanese essence, Wu said.</P>
      <P>He was responding to Non-Partisan Solidarity Union Legislator Yen Ching-piao who
said that Matsu worshipping has been recently approved as an intangible heritage
in need of urgent safeguarding by the UNESCO's intangible heritage committee.</P>
      <P>Yen asked whether the government could consider listing Matsu's birthday, March
23 on the lunar calendar, as a memorial day in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yen, currently chairman of the Taichung-based Jenn Lann Temple, which is one of
the pivotal temples in Taiwan for worshipping Matsu, said Matsu worshipping and
culture, stemming from fishing communities near China's southeastern coasts more
than 1,000 years ago, has been spread around the world, with the number of
followers exceeding hundreds of millions.</P>
      <P>The annual procession to honor Matsu has been held for over a century in Taiwan
and usually starts from Jenn Lann Temple, drawing thousands of followers.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese Matsu followers have also regularly made pilgrimages to Meizhou Island
of Fujian Province, which has for long been considered the "home" of Matsu.</P>
      <P>According to legend, Matsu was a young woman who was born into a fisherman's
family in Meizhou, in 960 AD (during the early Northern Song Dynasty). She was
deified later for sacrificing her life to save her father and brothers.</P>
      <P>Besides Taiwan, she is worshipped in areas of East Asia with a sea faring
tradition, including eastern China, especially Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong
provinces, as well as in Hong Kong and neighboring areas in Southeast Asia,
including Vietnam.</P>
      <P>She is also worshipped in places where Chinese people immigrated, including
Singapore, and Los Angeles.</P>
      <P>Although she was initially believed to just bless the sea for fishermen, as time
went by, people prayed to her for good health, a successful  career  or
business,  good  harvests,  and  smooth relationships.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will be very pleased to exhibit National Palace Museum (NPM) artworks in
Japan if the government there enacts anti-seizure legislation that would grant
immunity to artworks from abroad, President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ma made the comment at the Presidential Office during a meeting with a group of
Japanese parliamentarians from Japan's ruling Democratic Party and it major
opposition Liberal Democratic Party.</P>
      <P>According to the NPM, its collections are national assets protected by strict
laws and regulations that allow for overseas exhibitions only in countries that
adhere to international legal standards of protecting  artworks on loan from
abroad against forfeiture.</P>
      <P>Many countries have enacted anti-seizure legislation to guarantee immunity for
artworks and historic relics on loan from abroad for exhibitions.</P>
      <P>Japan and Belgium have both expressed interest in borrowing NPM pieces for
exhibitions, but the NPM has said that this would not be possible unless the two
countries enact the relevant anti-seizure laws.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in the meeting with the Japanese dietmen, President Ma reiterated
that he will continue to work towards strengthening Taiwan-Japan ties.</P>
      <P>Some of the achievements so far include the Taiwan-Japan talks in February on
fishery disputes, the launch in June of working holiday tours, and the opening
of Taiwan's new representative office in Sapporo, Japan, he noted.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan government plans to open a cultural center in Tokyo to promote
exchanges between the two sides, he added.</P>
      <P>The president also expressed thanks for Japan's generous relief donations for
Typhoon Morakot victims in southern Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Free vaccinations against swine flu, officially known as influenza A(H1N1), will
be kicked off nationwide on Nov. 1 and completed prior to the 2010 Chinese New
Year's Day, which falls on Feb. 14, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC)
reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A total of 12 million vials of the vaccine will be used up by that time, with
children under the age of 9 receiving a two-dose vaccine to be sourced from the
Swiss pharmaceutical firm Novartis and people aged above 9 receiving one dose,
the CECC said.</P>
      <P>The Novartis vaccine has been proven to be effective for the young and the old
in Taiwan as over 70 percent of those tested produced antibodies against the
A(H1N1) virus.</P>
      <P>"If the vaccine developed by Adimmune Corp., Taiwan's sole human vaccine
manufacturer, proves to have the same effectiveness, the Adimmune products will
also be distributed in the upcoming vaccination drive, " said Department of
Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has placed orders with Novartis for a total of 5 million doses. The first
batch of 370,000 vials are scheduled to arrive on Oct. 22.</P>
      <P>"Some 4 million people are set to benefit from the vaccination drive when all
the 5 million Novartis vaccine arrive, " Yaung said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Director-General Steve
Kuo, the DOH has purchased a total of 10 million doses of vaccine against the
A(H1N1) virus from Adimmune Corp. and delivery is expected to begin at the end
of October.</P>
      <P>Results of human trials of the Adimmune vaccine, which began on Sept. 23, are
expected to be known as early as this week, he added.</P>
      <P>The vaccine will be distributed in order of priority, starting with typhoon-
affected victims, medical personnel in charge of disease control and prevention,
and pregnant women.</P>
      <P>They will be followed by pre-school children, seriously ill patients,
elementary, junior and senior high school students, individuals in the 19-24 age
bracket and those over 25 at high risk of cardiopulmonary disease, healthy
people in the 25-49 age bracket, and those between 50 and 64.</P>
      <P>Statistics released by the CECC show that the total number of A(H1N1)
hospitalized patients in Taiwan since the outbreak began had reached 388 as of
late Monday. Of the total, 22 remain in the hospital, 342 have recovered and
been discharged, and 24 others have died.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a total of 536 classes in 316 schools around the country remain
suspended because of H1N1 infections among students. The number of affected
classes accounted for 0.36 percent of the total, according to the CECC.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday that it would welcome any
visits to Taiwan by high level U.S. officials, including Secretary of Veteran
Affairs Eric Shinseki, as such visits would serve to increase interaction
between Taipei and Washington.</P>
      <P>"The Foreign Ministry's stance is that it would be happy to have top-level U.S.
officials visit Taiwan and exchange opinions," said James Chang, deputy
spokesman of the MOFA.</P>
      <P>Tseng Jing-ling, minister of Taiwan's Veteran Affairs Commission, said Monday in
the Legislative Yuan that his commission has extended an invitation to Shinseki
and that the earliest possible time for him to visit Taiwan would be next
spring.</P>
      <P>However, Christopher Kavanagh, press officer at the American Institute in Taiwan
(AIT), told the Central News Agency that the AIT is not aware of the invitation
and that "no decisions have been made for him (Shinseki) to travel to Taiwan."</P>
      <P>There have also been media reports that Taiwan and the U.S. are negotiating on a
visit to Taiwan by a high-level U.S. official, believed to be Shinseki.</P>
      <P>If Shinseki does visit Taiwan, he will be the first Cabinet member from the U.S.
to do so in nearly a decade, and this could signal significant strengthening of
Taiwan-U.S. relations.</P>
      <P>A visit in 2000 by former U.S. Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater was the
most recent by a U.S. Cabinet member.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will handle the issue of naming the
economic cooperation agreement which the island hopes to sign with China,
Mainland Affairs Council Deputy Chairman Liu Te-shun said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Liu gave the explanation in response to media inquiries about the difference in
name given by Taiwan and mainland China for the pact, which Taiwan's government
hopes to sign by next year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has called it an "economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) " while
China has called it a "cross-strait economic cooperation agreement" without the
word framework.</P>
      <P>The debates on the designation arose after China's Ministry of Commerce used its
name for the accord in the Chinese-language abstract of a research report it
released on Monday on the planned accord.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, Taiwan's economic affairs ministry is the authority on the
subject since it has been promoting the agreement's signing and playing the role
of pushing for informal communications with China on the matter.</P>
      <P>And officials responsible for economic and trade affairs from the two sides will
be the ones responsible for jointly working out the content of the planned
agreement, Liu said.</P>
      <P>According to an MOEA position paper, the cross-strait agreement, temporarily
named ECFA, is a fundamental accord regulating economic cooperation activities
between the two sides.</P>
      <P>However, the word "framework" is used because the ECFA is only the guideline of
a formal agreement, according to the MOEA. Because it must take the two sides a
long time to complete the formal pact, the MOEA therefore has proposed signing
the "framework agreement" first to resolve urgent problems, the paper said.</P>
      <P>A formal agreement can not be decided without cross-strait talks, the paper
noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday that Japan will need to iron out relevant
legislation before a proposed exhibition on national treasures from the National
Palace Museum (NPM) can take place in Japan.</P>
      <P>Ma issued the call while receiving a group of dietmen of the ruling Democratic
Party of Japan and the opposition  Liberal Democratic Party during a meeting at
the Presidential Office, in response  to  an earlier  proposal  put  forward  by
Japanese parliamentarians.</P>
      <P>"Should Japan be able to iron out such a special law or revise its current
regulations to provide a safety guarantee to ensure that Taiwan's priceless
national artifacts will be free from judicial seizure while out of the country,
Taiwan will be very pleased to allow NPM treasures to be exhibited in Japan, "
Ma said.</P>
      <P>Prior to the 1990s, pieces from the NPM were rarely displayed in other
countries, and loans of items to complement exhibitions in foreign museums were
uncommon. The first time such a thing occurred was at the Galeries Nationales du
Grand Palais in Paris in 1998.</P>
      <P>Many countries are interested in borrowing pieces from the NPM to show in
exhibitions in their museums and galleries, but this is only possible for
countries in which laws on the guaranteed return of the pieces have been
established, NPM Director Chou Kung-shin said recently, adding that Taiwan has
already enacted such a law.</P>
      <P>Over the past decade, priceless NPM art works have been shown in Austria,
France, Germany and the United States, which all have the relevant laws in place
due to Taiwan's unique political status and concern that should such pieces
leave Taiwan, Beijing might otherwise make an ownership claim on them.</P>
      <P>To pave the way for an NPM exhibition to be staged in Berlin and Bonn in 2003,
for example, Taiwan and Germany clinched an agreement in 2002 after arrangements
had been made by both sides in 1998, shortly after the German parliament passed
a law regarding the protection of foreign art objects during exhibitions in
Germany.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier says alternative Suhua freeway plan ready by March 2010</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Tuesday that the Executive Yuan will complete a
feasibility study on the construction of an alternative to the dangerous
sections of the controversial Suhua freeway on Taiwan's east coast.</P>
      <P>The alternative, which will be 20 kilometers long, is expected to be located
farther from the planned coastal route of the proposed 86-k m Suhua freeway.</P>
      <P>Environmentalists  have said the construction of the Suhua freeway, which has 40
kilometers of tunnels, might be dangerous because of proximity to fault lines.</P>
      <P>Considering that the substitute freeway could have sensitive geological factors,
the government needs to evaluate the project cautiously and then decide whether
to build the alternative, Wu said, while responding to questions at the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Wu added that the alternative highway may cost up to tens of billions of Taiwan
dollars, so therefore it should be assessed carefully.</P>
      <P>However, the evaluation will not last more than two years and a feasibility
study is expected to be ready by March 2010, according to Wu.</P>
      <P>The disputed Suhua freeway was proposed more than a decade ago to connect
eastern Taiwan's Yilan and Hualien counties. It would be a new means of
transportation between Suao township and Hualien city, but due to environmental
protection issues, this project has been temporarily suspended.</P>
      <P>Environmentalists have raised strong objections against the project, saying it
could destroy the scenic beauty, as well as flora, fauna and ecological balance
of the area along the proposed route.</P>
      <P>Proponents of the expressway have argued it will boost the economy of the region
in eastern Taiwan, which is relatively undeveloped and consists mostly of
farming communities.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu said in Taoyuan on Tuesday that the
construction of northern Taiwan's Wugu-Yangmei viaduct on Freeway No. 1 and the
Taoyuan Aerotropolis will both begin in November.</P>
      <P>Chu, a former magistrate of Taoyuan county, said the construction of the viaduct
from Taipei county's Wugu to Taoyuan county's Yangmei was originally scheduled
to take place by the end of 2010, but considering the frequent and heavy traffic
jams on the freeway between Taoyuan and Taipei, he has been pushing for the
construction to start earlier.</P>
      <P>He also  said construction  of the blue  line of Taoyuan international airport's
Mass Rapid Transportation(MRT) connecting Gueishan township and Chungli city has
been undergoing quickly and smoothly.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Removal of missiles will help to build cross-strait trust: official</HEADLINE>

      <P>Any move by China to either dismantle or remove the missiles it has aimed at
Taiwan will be helpful to the establishment of confidence building measures
(CBMs) between the two sides, an official with the Ministry of National Defense
(MND) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Removal of the missiles by China would involve a sophisticated review of its
military system and would be deemed a positive step towards building trust
between Taiwan and China, " Lee Hsi-ming, an MND department chief said at a
press conference at which Taiwan's 2009 national defense report was released.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou in an interview Monday with Reuters urged China to scrap
the growing number of missiles it has aimed at Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"(There are) more than 1,000 (missiles) and they haven't changed that. The
number continues to go up. That is certainly a great concern for the people
here," Ma told Reuters.</P>
      <P>Responding to media questions about the number of missiles that are deployed
mostly along China's southeastern coast opposite Taiwan, Colonel Kao Chung-pang
of the MND's military information division said that his ministry "knows the
exact number of missiles but it cannot make that information public." He did not
elaborate further.</P>
      <P>David G. Brown, a U.S. expert on China affairs, said in Comparative Connections,
a quarterly published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies
(CSIS), that the number of missiles has grown to 1,500.</P>
      <P>Kao said the buildup of missiles is a long-term strategic policy for China and
an issue of deep concern among Japan, the United States and other Western
countries.</P>
      <P>Lee said China will send a goodwill message by acting to either scrap or remove
its missiles targeting Taiwan, which would be helpful to establishing cross-
strait CBMs.</P>
      <P>Saying that the MND will do its best to complete all necessary preparations for
the cross-strait CBMs, Lee added that it is currently collecting and studying
domestic and foreign reports on CBMs, especially those between China and its
neighbors like Russia, India and Kazakhstan.</P>

      <P>Hon Hai Group Chairman Terry Gou will act as an ambassador to promote Taipei's
participation in World Expo 2010 Shanghai, an official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The business group is a sponsor of the Taipei Pavilion that the Taipei City
Government will set up at the exhibition. The pavilion is expected to feature
the city's ubiquitous wireless Internet access and its garbage and recycling
policies.</P>
      <P>According to Huang Nan-hui, a consultant of the Hon Hai Education Foundation,
Gou decided to provide sponsorship  for the city government's participation in
the expo because the themes are consistent  with  Hon Hai's  corporate  values
that emphasize environmental protection and energy conservation.</P>
      <P>Gou will also take part in activities to be held by the city government as a
warm-up to the exhibition. The activities will include a creativity competition
to choose the smile, love letter, logo and image that best represent Taipei,
Huang said.</P>
      <P>Huang said Hon Hai has hired a renowned art consulting firm to help plan the
Taipei Pavilion exhibition and has commissioned an excellent exhibition designer
to build the pavilion.</P>
      <P>To achieve the goals of environmental protection and energy conservation, the
pavilion will be constructed in line with the "3R" principle of reduce, recycle
and reuse, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Tuesday that Taiwan has
benefited from its "gradual" dialogues with China.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan made the remarks in a speech delivered to students
at the National University of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>For example, Lai said, the number of Taiwan's diplomatic allies has remained at
23 since President Ma Ying-jeou adopted his pragmatic "modus vivendi" approach
to diplomacy by seeking not to compete with China over diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>This is in stark contrast to the record of former President Chen Shui-bian, who,
during his eight years in office, launched an "all-out fight" against China in
the diplomatic arena that resulted in Taiwan losing six of its diplomatic allies
to its neighbor on the other side of the Taiwan Strait, according to Lai.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been able to secure its national sovereignty in its dealing with
China, evidenced in the fact that neither Taiwan nor China deny either one's
existence, which Lai said represents major progress from the past formula of
"never recognizing each other's sovereignty."</P>
      <P>"We are now able to take part in the World Health Assembly (WHA) and other
international organizations " without the need to obtain China's approval, as
long as China does not actively oppose," Lai said.</P>
      <P>In the three rounds of talks held between them since Ma was inaugurated in May
last year, Taiwan and China have inked nine agreements to increase cross-strait
exchanges.</P>
      <P>On a proposed cross-strait  economic cooperation  framework agreement (ECFA),
Lai said such an agreement is essential in order to secure Taiwan's global
competitive edge in the face of the formation of free trade groupings among the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and other countries, including China.</P>
      <P>Regarding  the upcoming next round of cross-strait  talks, scheduled to take
place in December in Taichung, central Taiwan, Lai said the new round of
negotiations will mainly focus on technical aspects related to agriculture,
fishery and taxation issues.</P>
      <P>Addressing students' concerns over a government plan to allow Taiwanese colleges
and universities to recruit students from China, Lai said the incoming Chinese
students could serve as a stimulus to help upgrade Taiwan's academic levels, and
added that certain areas, such as medicine, will not be open to the Chinese
students.</P>

      <P>The European Chamber of Commerce Taipei (ECCT) has suggested that Taiwan carry
out overall tax reform and build a sound legal environment so as to lure
European investors back to Taiwan, from where they could break into the Chinese
market.</P>
      <P>Such reform will create a better business climate and will also spur Taiwan to
better develop its economy, the ECCT states in its 2009-2010 position papers
which will be made public on Oct. 30.</P>
      <P>In the annual report, the ECCT recommends that Taiwan slash customs rates and
remove trade barriers to strike a balance in bilateral trade and commerce and
effectively bolster such activity between Taiwan and the European Union (EU).</P>
      <P>The report stresses the importance of EU-Taiwan cooperation and advocates the
signing of a mutually beneficial agreement on Trade Enhancement Measures,
similar to a free trade agreement, to create more business opportunities.</P>
      <P>The ECCT also notes that Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organization's
Agreement  on Government  Procurement  and  the government's efforts to improve
cross-Taiwan Strait political and economic ties are moves in the right
direction.</P>
      <P>This year, a total of 20 ECCT committees have produced position papers that
offer suggestions to Taiwan on issues like building a more competitive taxation
system,  improving the legal system, upgrading infrastructure and offering

      <P>Two leading Taiwanese fuel cell companies said Tuesday that fuel cell
manufacture is a future "star" green industry in which Taiwan should move now in
order to take the lead.</P>
      <P>They added that the government will have to play a significant role in providing
more incentives and subsidies for the budding industry to develop.</P>
      <P>Chung-hsin Electric and Machinery Manufacturing (CHEM) ,  a mechanical-
electrical  enterprise,  and M-Field Energy Ltd.,  a manufacturer of back-up
power systems, made the remarks ahead of the first Taiwan International Green
Industry Show scheduled to open Oct. 21 with the aim of sharing Taiwan's
innovations with the global market.</P>
      <P>Company representatives told CNA that Taiwan should act now to retain the niche
market of fuel cells while the country still enjoys the advantage of producing
the products at a lower cost than Japan or Canada, which are also involved in
the field.</P>
      <P>"Without the government's  support,  both by investing  in production and
outlining a sensible subsidy scheme for consumers who opt for fuel cells,
individual companies will be fighting a very difficult battle to open markets
domestically and overseas, " said Mark Huang, marketing manager of M-Field.</P>
      <P>M-Field manufactures MF-UTH-10 to be an eco-friendly solution to replace
conventional diesel generators, as it consumes hydrogen from hydrogen cylinders
to produce sustainable electricity and heat with water as the only byproduct.</P>
      <P>Robert C. Wu, general director of CHEM's Renewable Energy R&amp;D Center, also
said the government plays a key role in the success of their product -- 1
kilowatt residential fuel cell combined heat and power (CHP) system that uses
natural gas as its fuel source.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the CHEM fuel cell system operates at an efficiency rate of 75
percent-85 percent, compared to traditional power plants, which lose 65 percent
of the generated power during transmission.</P>
      <P>"The system is the best eco-friendly solution for residential use, as it
produces 40 percent less, or 2.7 tons less carbon dioxide per year compared to
that generated by conventional coal fired power plants and water heaters," Wu
said.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the Taiwanese government should model Japan's practice, in
which people opting for fuel cell CHP systems pay 1 million yen (US$11,072)
toward the cost of the machine, while the Japanese government provides 1.2
million yen in subsidies.</P>
      <P>Each household using the fuel cells can then save 60,000 yen per year on
electricity and heating, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Noting that CHEM's fuel cell CHP systems will cost around the same as the
Japanese ones, Wu said his company is looking to partner with Japan's Hitachi
next year for production.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The quality of the irrigation water in Changhua County has been greatly improved
since regular inspections of factory wastewater and severe penalties imposed by
the authorities have forced electro-plating factories in the region to address
their water pollution  problems,  according  to an official  of the
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA).</P>
      <P>Chiang Chu-nung, an EPA inspector in central Taiwan, said that in recent years
the EPA has conducted frequent inspections on the over 100 electro-plating
factories in the county's coastal region, detecting heavy metals such as
cadmium, chromium, nickel, zinc and copper in their wastewater.</P>
      <P>Rice paddies and oyster farms polluted by heavy metals from factory wastewater
caused major losses to the agricultural sector several years ago when consumers
panicked over cadmium-contaminated rice and "green oysters" from the area.</P>
      <P>Chiang said,  however,  that between  2004 and 2008,  the qualification rate of
irrigation water in the region rose from 33 percent to 73 percent.</P>
      <P>Any factory reported to be violating the anti-water pollution regulations will
be fined NT$60,000, and if no improvement is made within a certain period, will
be fined another NT$60,000, according to Chiang.</P>

      <P>In a bid to demonstrate its determination to carry out party reforms, the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) revoked Tuesday the eligibility of two vote-buying members to

      <P>Juan Kang-meng, chairman of the KMT's disciplinary committee, said Yang Chi-

    <HEADLINE>MAC: Taiwan benefiting from dialogues with China</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung, Oct. 20 (CNA)
10/20/09  20:30:29
(By Cheng Chi-feng and Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Tuesday that Taiwan has
benefited from its "gradual" dialogues with China.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan made the remarks in a speech delivered to students
at the National University of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>For example, Lai said, the number of Taiwan's diplomatic allies has remained at
23 since President Ma Ying-jeou adopted his pragmatic "modus vivendi" approach
to diplomacy by seeking not to compete with China over diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>This is in stark contrast to the record of former President Chen Shui-bian, who,
during his eight years in office, launched an "all-out fight" against China in
the diplomatic arena that resulted in Taiwan losing six of its diplomatic allies
to its neighbor on the other side of the Taiwan Strait, according to Lai.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been able to secure its national sovereignty in its dealing with
China, evidenced in the fact that neither Taiwan nor China deny either one's
existence, which Lai said represents major progress from the past formula of
"never recognizing each other's sovereignty."</P>
      <P>"We are now able to take part in the World Health Assembly (WHA) and other
international organizations " without the need to obtain China's approval, as
long as China does not actively oppose," Lai said.</P>
      <P>In the three rounds of talks held between them since Ma was inaugurated in May
last year, Taiwan and China have inked nine agreements to increase cross-strait
exchanges.</P>
      <P>On a proposed cross-strait  economic cooperation  framework agreement (ECFA),
Lai said such an agreement is essential in order to secure Taiwan's global
competitive edge in the face of the formation of free trade groupings among the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and other countries, including China.</P>
      <P>Regarding  the upcoming next round of cross-strait  talks, scheduled to take
place in December in Taichung, central Taiwan, Lai said the new round of
negotiations will mainly focus on technical aspects related to agriculture,
fishery and taxation issues.</P>
      <P>Addressing students' concerns over a government plan to allow Taiwanese colleges
and universities to recruit students from China, Lai said the incoming Chinese
students could serve as a stimulus to help upgrade Taiwan's academic levels, and
added that certain areas, such as medicine, will not be open to the Chinese
students.</P>

Nov. 9, the 20th anniversary of the wall coming down, an official said Tuesday.</P>

segment in light of the foundation's rich international networks.</P>
      <P>Although Germany and Taiwan have no diplomatic relations, the gift is a token of
Germany's recognition of Taiwan's democratic achievements and proof that

    <TEXT>
      <P>The European Chamber of Commerce Taipei (ECCT) has suggested that Taiwan carry
out overall tax reform and build a sound legal environment so as to lure
European investors back to Taiwan, from where they could break into the Chinese
market.</P>
      <P>Such reform will create a better business climate and will also spur Taiwan to
better develop its economy, the ECCT states in its 2009-2010 position papers
which will be made public on Oct. 30.</P>
      <P>In the annual report, the ECCT recommends that Taiwan slash customs rates and
remove trade barriers to strike a balance in bilateral trade and commerce and
effectively bolster such activity between Taiwan and the European Union (EU).</P>
      <P>The report stresses the importance of EU-Taiwan cooperation and advocates the
signing of a mutually beneficial agreement on Trade Enhancement Measures,
similar to a free trade agreement, to create more business opportunities.</P>
      <P>The ECCT also notes that Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organization's
Agreement  on Government  Procurement  and  the government's efforts to improve
cross-Taiwan Strait political and economic ties are moves in the right
direction.</P>
      <P>This year, a total of 20 ECCT committees have produced position papers that
offer suggestions to Taiwan on issues like building a more competitive taxation
system,  improving the legal system, upgrading infrastructure and offering
incentives for green industry.</P>

      <P>In a bid to demonstrate its determination to carry out party reforms, the ruling

sit on its decision-making Central Standing Committee (CSC).</P>
      <P>Juan Kang-meng, chairman of the KMT's disciplinary committee, said Yang Chi-

    <TEXT>
      <P>The quality of the irrigation water in Changhua County has been greatly improved
since regular inspections of factory wastewater and severe penalties imposed by
the authorities have forced electro-plating factories in the region to address
their water pollution  problems,  according  to an official  of the
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA).</P>
      <P>Chiang Chu-nung, an EPA inspector in central Taiwan, said that in recent years
the EPA has conducted frequent inspections on the over 100 electro-plating
factories in the county's coastal region, detecting heavy metals such as
cadmium, chromium, nickel, zinc and copper in their wastewater.</P>
      <P>Rice paddies and oyster farms polluted by heavy metals from factory wastewater
caused major losses to the agricultural sector several years ago when consumers
panicked over cadmium-contaminated rice and "green oysters" from the area.</P>
      <P>Chiang said,  however,  that between  2004 and 2008,  the qualification rate of
irrigation water in the region rose from 33 percent to 73 percent.</P>
      <P>Any factory reported to be violating the anti-water pollution regulations will
be fined NT$60,000, and if no improvement is made within a certain period, will
be fined another NT$60,000, according to Chiang.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Call for government to help develop fuel cell systems</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 20 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two leading Taiwanese fuel cell companies said Tuesday that fuel cell
manufacture is a future "star" green industry in which Taiwan should move now in
order to take the lead.</P>
      <P>They added that the government will have to play a significant role in providing
more incentives and subsidies for the budding industry to develop.</P>
      <P>Chung-hsin Electric and Machinery Manufacturing (CHEM) ,  a mechanical-
electrical  enterprise,  and M-Field Energy Ltd.,  a manufacturer of back-up
power systems, made the remarks ahead of the first Taiwan International Green
Industry Show scheduled to open Oct. 21 with the aim of sharing Taiwan's
innovations with the global market.</P>
      <P>Company representatives told CNA that Taiwan should act now to retain the niche
market of fuel cells while the country still enjoys the advantage of producing
the products at a lower cost than Japan or Canada, which are also involved in
the field.</P>
      <P>"Without the government's  support,  both by investing  in production and
outlining a sensible subsidy scheme for consumers who opt for fuel cells,
individual companies will be fighting a very difficult battle to open markets
domestically and overseas, " said Mark Huang, marketing manager of M-Field.</P>
      <P>M-Field manufactures MF-UTH-10 to be an eco-friendly solution to replace
conventional diesel generators, as it consumes hydrogen from hydrogen cylinders
to produce sustainable electricity and heat with water as the only byproduct.</P>
      <P>Robert C. Wu, general director of CHEM's Renewable Energy R&amp;D Center, also
said the government plays a key role in the success of their product -- 1
kilowatt residential fuel cell combined heat and power (CHP) system that uses
natural gas as its fuel source.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the CHEM fuel cell system operates at an efficiency rate of 75
percent-85 percent, compared to traditional power plants, which lose 65 percent
of the generated power during transmission.</P>
      <P>"The system is the best eco-friendly solution for residential use, as it
produces 40 percent less, or 2.7 tons less carbon dioxide per year compared to
that generated by conventional coal fired power plants and water heaters," Wu
said.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the Taiwanese government should model Japan's practice, in
which people opting for fuel cell CHP systems pay 1 million yen (US$11,072)
toward the cost of the machine, while the Japanese government provides 1.2
million yen in subsidies.</P>
      <P>Each household using the fuel cells can then save 60,000 yen per year on
electricity and heating, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Noting that CHEM's fuel cell CHP systems will cost around the same as the
Japanese ones, Wu said his company is looking to partner with Japan's Hitachi
next year for production.</P>

      <P>A Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) official said Tuesday that
the first Taiwan International Green Industry Show (TiGiS) will serve as a first
step to bring Taiwan's innovations to the global market.</P>
      <P>Moses Yen, executive director of TAITRA's Exhibition Department, made the
remarks at a press conference a day before the show's opening, saying that the
exhibition will showcase Taiwan's green solutions and products under the themes
of Clean Energy, Green Environment, Water Technology and Eco-life.</P>
      <P>"Two messages we would like to convey are that green energy technologies are not
unattainable or unaffordable," Yen said.</P>
      <P>Organized by TAITRA and the Expo Union Corporation, the 2009 TiGiS is scheduled
for Oct. 21-24 at the Taipei World Trade Center and will feature some 150 local
and overseas exhibitors, including the American State Offices Association and
the Japan External Trade Organization, which will introduce their countries'
environmental protection efforts and results.</P>
      <P>In order to raise public awareness of and interest in applying green products to
their daily lives, a Green Tech Pavilion will be dedicated  to innovations  such
as a carbon  dioxide  garment dry-cleaning machine, awater free urinal, eco-
textiles and paper made from stone.</P>
      <P>Also in line with the trend of eco-protection, the show will focus on Taiwanese
companies producing fuel cell systems that use hydrogen as the fuel for
stationary power generators that can provide virtually continuous electricity
and heat with zero emissions of greenhouse gasses.</P>

      <P>Although most people are supportive of opening Taiwan's financial markets to
China, they generally think that strict controls should be imposed on financial
institutions from China, according to the results of a survey released Tuesday
by the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC).</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted Oct. 16-18 among 1,084 adults around Taiwan by the TVBS
Poll Center for the MAC. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent.</P>
      <P>The results revealed that 56.1 percent of respondents are in favor of
discussions between Taiwan and China on the issue of financial market
liberalization.</P>
      <P>However, 69.5 percent of respondents said Chinese financial institutions should
be subject to stricter controls than those from other countries if they are
allowed to set up operations in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Sixty percent  of respondents  think that the signing  of cross-Taiwan Strait
memorandums of understanding (MOUs) on financial regulation and supervision will
help provide a sound environment for financial exchanges between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Also, 53.2 percent of respondents believe the MOUs are favorable to the
development of Taiwan's financial sector.</P>
      <P>Financial authorities in Taiwan and China have engaged in months of negotiations
to pave the way for the establishment of three MOUs for cross-Taiwan Strait
cooperation in the supervision and regulation of banking, insurance, and
securities and futures.</P>
      <P>MAC officials said recently that the two sides have achieved significant
progress in their discussions, making it likely the agreements will be signed

    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials
Wednesday:</P>
      <P>LIBERTY TIMES: From Zhang Yuanyuan incident to President Ma's final
identification</P>
      <P>During a recent military parade in Beijing, a woman soldier named Zhang Yuanyuan
said that "to devote myself to the motherland is my biggest wish."</P>
      <P>Her words might not be a big deal. But she applied to become a permanent
resident of Singapore a few years ago, which has offended Singaporeans because
they were not happy to have someone who openly pledged allegiance to China to be
a new immigrant.</P>
      <P>There are many examples of people like Zhang in Taiwan. Some new immigrants came
to Taiwan around 1949 when China was lost to the communists in a civil war. But
even though they have lived in Taiwan for most of their lives, they do not treat
earlier immigrants as their compatriots, instead identifying with the communist
regime.</P>
      <P>Zhang's remarks have raised the alarm in Singapore. But Taiwan has not shown the
same alarm against the "my heart goes to the motherland" Ma administration. They
voted for Ma Ying-jeou in the presidential election even though he still had not
given a clear explanation of his possession of a U.S. green card.</P>
      <P>Both Taiwan and Singapore are independent, sovereign states, but Singapore is
clear on its national identification, while Taiwan is not, and this is why China
is able to infiltrate and divide Taiwan.</P>
      <P>UNITED DAILY NEWS: Does DPP dare say it doesn't want middle-ground voters?</P>
      <P>The disgraced former President Chen Shui-bian asked while being detained who in
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) dares to say that he or she
doesn't want ballots from pro-Chen voters,  meaning  the hard-core  green  and
Taiwan-independence advocates.</P>
      <P>But what the DPP should ask itself is "who in the party dares to say that he or
she doesn't want ballots from middle-ground voters?"</P>
      <P>Middle-ground voters have long been unhappy with the lack of self-examination
within the DPP related to the corruption of Chen's aides and confidants and
Chen's downgrading of Taiwan independence by contending in legal proceedings
that Taiwan actually belongs to the United States.</P>
      <P>In the runup to the 2012 presidential election, the DPP has to sort out its
discourse on Taiwan independence. During that time, two major things will have
taken place: closer cross-strait relations after the signing of an economic
cooperation framework agreement and the celebration of the 100th anniversary of
the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The ROC will have been in existence for a century by then, and Taiwan will have
lifted martial law rule on the island for 23 years. Will the DPP still want
Taiwan independence then?</P>
      <P>The relationship between the DPP and Chen is one between the party and Taiwan
independence. The relationship between the DPP and Taiwan independence will
hinge on the party and the middle-ground voters. If the party wants to preserve
the votes of those who support Chen, it cannot count on those in the middle to
vote for the party in 2012.</P>
      <P>CHINA TIMES:</P>
      <P>Planning celebration of ROC's 100th anniversary</P>
      <P>The government is reportedly forming an organizing committee for the celebration
of the 100th anniversary of the Republic of China. But we think the method and
content of the celebration are more important.</P>
      <P>China recently held a grand military parade to celebrate its 60th founding
anniversary. The parade aimed to demonstrate China's status as a "world power"
and in a sense reflect national emotions after hundreds of years of being
suppressed by foreign powers.</P>
      <P>If we use war memories or stances to interprete history, it is bound to evoke
different views on such issues as cross-strait relations and unification vs.
independence.</P>
      <P>However, if we think from the perspective of the people, it will not be hard to
forge consensus.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan is a mature democracy, we should organize the celebration based on
the concept and perspective of "by the people."</P>
      <P>The organizing committee should not dwell too much on power struggles or the
transfer of power but rather concern itself with people's lives in delineating
and recalling changes over the past 100 years.</P>
      <P>Taking medical development as an example, we could contrast world and ROC
timelines to track specific diseases, mortality rates, vaccine popularization
and when Taiwan and China caught up to East Asian medical standards. The record
will illustrate the ROC's progress in the world.</P>
      <P>There are many other areas, such as the arts, literature, technology,
agriculture, education, transportation, textiles and sports, where similar
progress has been made over the past 100 years.</P>
      <P>Focusing on the people will show the pluralistic facets of Taiwan and will
invite  people's  enthusiastic  participation  in the celebrations rather than
alienation from them.</P>
      <P>APPLE DAILY: (A) Re-election of KMT Central Standing Committee members</P>
      <P>Reports of vote-buying were rampant in the recent Kuomintang (KMT) Central
Standing Committee election.</P>
      <P>But in the end, the ruling party only invalidated the election of two Central
Standing Committee members.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has always touted his integrity, but despite his return
to the helm of the party recently, its election culture is still corrupt.</P>
      <P>The two were only stripped of their election victory but did not have their
party rights suspended or their party memberships canceled.</P>
      <P>Ma's integrity has been compromised. He should not be resigned to such lenient
discipline. It would be better to have another election for Central Standing
Committee members to serve as a warning to the party and improve Taiwan's
election culture. (B) Fickle policy</P>
      <P>The government announced Monday that it would levy an energy tax starting in
2011, resulting in a public outcry.</P>
      <P>Due to the strong opposition, Premier Wu Den-yih changed his tone, saying there
was no timetable for the levying of the tax and that it would wait until the
economy recovered and people's lives improved.</P>
      <P>Taiwan seems to be modern, but at its core retains the mind-set of a 19th
century government that has no regard for the public's feelings.</P>
      <P>Green policy involves many issues and requires careful and comprehensive
planning as well as public awareness education. Has the government known or done
anything about it? It would be better to invite experts from home and abroad to
give government officials some cram courses on the issue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>After 5 bus mishaps, foundation calls for safety tracking system</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  21  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) should establish a
traffic safety tracking system as soon as possible for passengers' well-being,
the Consumers' Foundation urged Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Enacting such a system has become urgent after five tragic accidents involving
large passenger buses took place in the past few weeks, " said Hsieh Tien-jen,
the nongovernmental foundation's chairman.</P>
      <P>Initial investigations of the accidents, which left a total of 12 people dead
and 36 injured, showed that two were related to driver fatigue and two others
were related to driver health, while the fifth resulted from mechanical failure.</P>
      <P>With these mishaps still fresh in people's minds, Hsieh said the MOTC could no
longer sit idly by and needed to create a safety tracking system that would not
only include vehicle maintenance records but also bus drivers'  health
situations  and working conditions.</P>
      <P>Hsieh bemoaned the ministry's failure to take precautionary measures  after four
of the 17 tour buses inspected  by the Cabinet-level Consumer Protection
Commission in April failed to meet applicable standards.</P>
      <P>"The 24 percent failure rate was alarmingly high, " Hsieh said, adding that the
MOTC should have taken a cue from such a figure.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Huang Yu-sheng, one of the foundation's  policy
advisers,  said the MOTC should  enhance information transparency on car
rentals.</P>
      <P>For instance, he said, operators should be required to provide the vehicle's
roll-off date,  maintenance records and accident history, and a list of its
drivers and travel records from the previous two days.</P>
      <P>"All relevant information should be included in car rental contracts," he added.</P>
      <P>On the management of passenger buses, Huang said every bus and not just randomly
selected vehicles should be inspected.</P>
      <P>At present, operators are only required to make available representative
vehicles for inspection,  along with a document assuring that all other vehicles
of the same model are of the same quality.</P>
      <P>"The recent spate of accidents involving large buses has proved that this kind
of quality control system has gaping black holes that should be plugged soon,"
Huang said.</P>
      <P>He recommended, moreover, that provisional inspection stations should be set up
at major tourist spots to facilitate roadside checks.</P>
      <P>Wu Chia-cheng, the foundation's secretary-general, said the government should
come up with legislation to restrict bus drivers' working hours.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that consumers browse the Directorate General of Highway's Web
site at www.thb.gov.tw to get more information about vehicles' conditions before
renting a tour bus.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan records 25th death from H1N1</HEADLINE>

      <P>Health authorities reported Wednesday that a 54-year-old man with underlying
conditions has died from influenza A (H1N1), the 25th person in Taiwan to die
from the virus.</P>
      <P>The patient, a resident of Keelung City, had suffered from hepatitis and kidney
disease, according to the Central Epidemics Command Center (CECC).</P>
      <P>CECC statistics showed that there were seven more patients hospitalized with the
H1N1 flu strain than a day earlier, including four children between seven months
and seven years old.</P>
      <P>The total number of such cases since the outbreak began has reached 395.</P>
      <P>While 25 of the patients remained in the hospital, 345 had recovered and been
discharged, the CECC said.</P>
      <P>As of 4 p.m. Tuesday, 639 classes in 367 schools around the country remained
closed because of H1N1 infections  among the students. The number of affected
classes account for 0.42 percent of the total, according to the CECC.</P>
      <P>Wang Chun-chuan, director-general of the Department of Physical Education under
the Ministry of Education, said the number of class closures on Tuesday was the
highest on record, which could be a sign that the H1N1 outbreak is escalating
again after a lull in late September.</P>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control under the Department of Health (DOH) recently
warned that a second wave of the H1N1 outbreak is emerging in Taiwan and is
likely to peak in November, after the previous wave peaked in early September.</P>
      <P>In an effort to contain the spread of the new flu strain, the DOH is scheduled
to launch a free nationwide inoculation program Nov. 1 that targets selected
groups considered at risk of developing serious complications from H1N1
infections.</P>
      <P>As the vaccines produced by local vaccine manufacturer Adimmune Corp. are not
expected to hit the market until mid-November, vaccines supplied by the Swiss-
based pharmaceutical firm Novartis will be used in the first weeks of the
program.</P>
      <P>Asked by lawmakers during a meeting of the legislature's Social Welfare and
Environmental Hygiene Committee about the performance of the locally produced
vaccine, DOH Minister Yaung Chih-liang said the initial results of human
clinical trials show that the Adimmune vaccine is not inferior to that made by
Novartis.</P>
      <P>Yaung said, however, that detailed results will only be made public after
related data are reviewed by a pharmaceutical screening committee under the DOH.</P>
      <P>According to Kang Chao-chou, chief of the DOH's Bureau of Pharmaceutical
Affairs, the committee is expected to meet Thursday night to review the results,
after which the conclusions will be forwarded to the CECC for its reference.</P>
      <P>However, a complete report on the protective effect and safety of the vaccine
will only be available in mid-November, he said.</P>

      <P>The number of Chinese nationals visiting Taiwan was largely up in the first nine
months of this year, reflecting measures taken by the government last year to
facilitate trips to Taiwan by Chinese travelers, National Immigration Agency
(NIA) Director General Hsieh Li-kung said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>A total of 426,782 Chinese nationals arrived in Taiwan between January and
September, far surpassing the 89,256 who visited in the first nine months of
2008, the NIA reported.</P>
      <P>Hsieh attributed the increase to several measures adopted by the government,
including opening Taiwan's doors wider to Chinese tourists in mid-July last year
and launching nonstop daily flights between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on border control strategies being held at Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport, Hsieh acknowledged, however, that the travel
liberalization  and more frequent cross-strait exchanges inevitably has had an
impact on national security.</P>
      <P>To learn from border control approaches adopted by advanced countries, experts
and immigration officials from 22 countries, including Australia, Britain,
Canada, Germany, and the Netherlands were invited by the NIA to give speeches on
the topic at the seminar.</P>
      <P>Speakers from Australia, Britain, Germany and the United States introduced how
they were applying new technologies to step up border control efforts, while
Canadian and Dutch officials focused on how to crack down on cross-border human
trafficking and on their preventive efforts to wipe out document forgery.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung city government has commissioned a video of fish fry being
released, to be distributed to students and faculty at schools around the city
with the aim of promoting the concept of marine resource conservation, city
officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>As Kaohsiung is a major fishery base, over the past 20 years the city government
has been releasing selected species of fry every year into the waters around the
city, according to officials of the city's Marine Bureau.</P>
      <P>This year, the coral reef areas of Chishan and neighboring regions were selected
for the release of some 22,000 orange-spotted groupers, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Weather and other conditions will be considered when deciding when to release
the fish, the officials went on, adding that for two consecutive years, orange-
spotted groupers have been selected for release because of their hardiness and
high economic value.</P>
      <P>Segments featuring researchers and experts instructing marine bureau officials
in how to properly implement the release will also be included in the video.</P>
      <P>Copies of the finished DVD will be distributed to 160,000 students and faculty

    <HEADLINE>Sun Yat-sen doll a top gift choice of Chinese tourists</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Because China sees Dr. Sun Yat-sen as a great Chinese revolutionary  and
political leader,  it is not surprising that items bearing his image at National
Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall have become highly popular items, especially Sun Yat-
sen dolls.</P>
      <P>The 10-centimeter-tall figurine has been the most popular item among Chinese
tourists at the facility's gift shop, said Cheng Nai-wen, the director of the
memorial hall, following a legislative committee meeting.</P>
      <P>Cheng estimated that the gift shop, which was reopened Oct. 5 after the hall
contracted the Taiwan Handicraft Promotion Center to run it, could generate
NT$2.76 million (US$85,235) annually in rights fees.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Sun Yat-sen dolls, which sell for NT$300 each, Chinese
tourists also like to buy documentary videos on the family of the late
Kuomintang (KMT) leader Chiang Kai-shek, stamps, Taiwan dollar bills,
commemorative coins and flags, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>"Mainland  tourists  often get excited  when they see the figurines, " said gift
shop manager Christine Chu, "And usually they don't just buy one doll."</P>
      <P>The souvenir shop also sells figurines of Chiang, his wife, and his son Chiang
Ching-kuo, communist Chinese figures such as Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, and
more recent figures such as President Ma Ying-jeou and Vice President Vincent
Siew, Chu added.</P>
      <P>She also noted that the Sun Yat-sen stamp collection, sold exclusively at the
memorial hall for NT$500, has been very popular among Chinese tourists since it
was launched a year ago.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the number of Chinese tourists visiting the facility has been steady
in recent months at about 1,000 per day, down from the peak in April and May
when 2,000-3,000 Chinese nationals visited the memorial hall.</P>
      <P>Sun Yat-sen is frequently referred to as the Father of the Nation as he played
an instrumental role in overthrowing the Qing Dynasty in 1911.</P>
      <P>He was the first provisional president when the Republic of China (ROC)  was
founded in 1912 and later co-founded  the Chinese Nationalist Party, or KMT, in
which he served as its first leader.</P>
      <P>Sun remains unique among 20th-century Chinese politicians for being widely
revered in both China and Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. state governor calls for cooperation on renewable energy</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kansas Governor Mark Parkinson said Wednesday in Taipei that Taiwan and the
United States should cooperate on renewable energy development, particularly in
wind and solar power, as it would serve the interests of both countries.</P>
      <P>Parkinson made the remarks in a meeting with local media after presiding over
the opening ceremony of the first Taiwan International Green Industry Show,
saying that he hoped his trip would create opportunities for Taiwan and Kansas
to work on developing wind power, as both have significant wind resources.</P>
      <P>"We are working toward developing wind power as a major source of electricity,
so we are hopeful that we can develop some relationships there as well,"
Parkinson said.</P>
      <P>Parkinson noted that wind power development in Kansas has grown significantly
over the past decade from two megawatts to 1,000 megawatts today, constituting
10 percent of the state's 10,000 megawatts of electrical capacity.</P>
      <P>The experience can serve as an example for Taiwan, which has a similar goal as
Kansas in that it wants to have 10 percent of its power generated from renewable
energy sources by 2010 and 20 percent by 2020, he said.</P>
      <P>The U.S. governor also suggested that Taiwan's engineers and researchers should
work on improving the storage of electricity, an area in which the U.S. is being
left behind.</P>
      <P>"If someone can make a breakthrough in battery storage, that will revolutionize
the use of wind power, making it much more prominent across the world,"
Parkinson said.</P>
      <P>Another area in which both sides can work is solar power, Parkinson went on,
noting that the use of solar power is very limited in Kansas, while many
Taiwanese companies have leading technologies in the area.</P>
      <P>Parkinson said he is looking forward to doing business with Taiwanese companies
seeking to supply solar panels to Kansas, as well as Taiwanese companies seeking
to establish production facilities in the state.</P>
      <P>Any company that employs more than 200 people and works on renewable energy is
eligible for significant tax incentives in Kansas, an offer that would also
apply to Taiwanese companies there, he added.</P>
      <P>Scheduled to leave Taiwan Oct. 25, Parkinson is visiting the country to mark 20
years of sister state relations between Taiwan and Kansas and to introduce the
green industry opportunities in his state.</P>

produced by Adimmune Corp, Taiwan's sole human vaccine manufacturer.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a meeting of the legislature's Social Welfare and

the Adimmune vaccine is in no way inferior  to  an H1N1  vaccine  marketed  by

      <P>Stressing that the initial results have been good, Yaung said, however, that the
final results will be made public in two days, after related data has been

      <P>Meanwhile, Ho Mei-shiang, head of Adimmune's R&amp;D department, told reporters
that the immunity effect of the swine flu vaccine is marvelous, as had been
expected, and she urged the public not to be worried about any ill-effects.</P>
      <P>According to Ho, the immunity effect of foreign-made H1N1 vaccines can reach 70
percent, while the mid-term results of the Adimmune vaccine's adult clinical
trials show that the local vaccine will not be any lower than that.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Folklore Museum (TFM) in Taichung City, central Taiwan, will launch a
unique exhibition Saturday, displaying more than 2,000 containers of locally
produced alcoholic drinks, including the oldest liquor found in Taiwan so far.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Exposition of Alcoholic Drinks, to be held in celebration of the
traditional Double Ninth Festival on the ninth day of the ninth lunar month,
will trace the history of Taiwanese wine, liquor and beer, TFM Director Chu
Chieh-yang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The exhibits will include Pai Lu liquor produced in 1941 during the era of
Japanese occupation. It is the oldest Taiwanese alcoholic drink that local
collectors have found so far, Chu said.</P>
      <P>Also on display will be a 1946 whiskey that was the first alcoholic drink to be
distilled by the Taiwan Provincial Monopoly Bureau after the island was claimed
by the Republic of China government.</P>
      <P>The most expensive local alcoholic drink at the exhibition will be a premium
Gaoliang liquor stored in a hand-painted porcelain jar, Chu said. It was brewed
at the Chiayi Distillery of the state-run Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corp and is
valued at NT$200,000 (US$6,180) per bottle, he added.</P>
      <P>More than 70 people have loaned their collections to the museum for the

the period after the Republic of China government took over Taiwan in 1945, and
the period after the monopoly on liquor was lifted in 2001.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, which will run through Jan. 9, 2010, will include workshops on

      <P>The government's recent decision to ban a planned visit by Uighur activist
Rebiya Kadeer had nothing to do with the issue of whether Taiwan is a democratic
country, a Presidential Office spokesman said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was exercising its sovereignty by making such a decision based on its
national interests, according to spokesman Wang Yu-chi.</P>
      <P>Wang made the statement after Kadeer, in an interview conducted in Tokyo with
the Taiwan-based Liberty Times, described the administration of President Ma
Ying-jeou as "undemocratic" for turning down her proposed visit.</P>
      <P>In September, Kadeer accepted an invitation for her to visit Taiwan in December,
which was extended by several Taiwanese pro-independence groups.</P>
      <P>Although Kadeer had not filed her visa application with the Taiwanese
authorities, the Cabinet decided on Sept. 25 that she should not be permitted to
visit on grounds that the World Uyghur Congress, of which Kadeer is president,
alleging that the group is closely associated with a terrorist group.</P>
      <P>Wang argued that it is unfair to call Taiwan "undemocratic" just because Kadeer
was denied access to the country.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the fact that "The 10 Conditions of Love, " a documentary
about the Kadeer's life, has been shown in Taiwan despite China's protest
demonstrates that Kadeer's freedom of speech is being protected in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Also, the fact that Kadeer's criticism of the head of state and the government
of Taiwan is allowed to be published in a local newspaper is evidence of
Taiwan's democracy, he said.</P>
      <P>He noted that not all individuals unwelcomed by China have been forbidden from
visiting Taiwan. The Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, for example, was
allowed entry despite Beijing's opposition, he added.</P>

      <P>The issue of press exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will not
be on the agenda of an upcoming fourth round of cross-strait talks, but Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) officials said Wednesday that when the time is ripe,
such discussions will be started.</P>
      <P>The fourth round of talks between SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his Chinese
counterpart  Chen Yunlin,  president  of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , is slated to take place in the
central Taiwan city of Taichung sometime in the second half of December.</P>
      <P>According to the SEF -- the semi-official intermediary body founded to deal with
cross-strait exchanges in the absence of official links -- Chiang has been
authorized by the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council to talk about four
major issues: a safety check and quality certification system for agricultural
products; moves to prevent double taxation; cooperation on fishery manpower
affairs; and cooperation on the promotion of standard product quality checking
and certification.</P>
      <P>All of these are problems that have emerged in the course of the increasingly
close trade and economic exchanges between the two sides, SEF officials said.</P>
      <P>In the future and at an appropriate time, the two sides will also consider talks
on the formation of a two-way investment guarantee agreement and a currency
clearing mechanism, intellectual property rights protection, the establishment
of a mechanism to handle economic and trade disputes, and cooperation and
exchanges in the fields of media, culture and education, they added.</P>
      <P>Addressing the issue of a widely anticipated proposed economic cooperation
framework agreement with China, the officials said Chiang and Chen might bring
the topic up during the Taichung talks, but will not sign an agreement at that
time.</P>

      <P>National Security Council (NSC) Secretary General Su Chi on Wednesday accused
opposition Legislator Chai Trong-Rong of slander for alleging that Su had
provided oceanographic data about Taiwan to China.</P>
      <P>Lai Su-ju, Su's attorney, on Wednesday filed a complaint against Chai with the
Taipei District Prosecutors Office. She said that Su will also launch a civil
suit against Chai, asking Chai to pay NT$3 million in compensation, and to carry
half-page notices of apology on the United Daily News, the China Times, the
Liberty Times and the Apple Daily, for infringing upon Su's rights.</P>
      <P>Chai, who is Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) whip at the Legislative Yuan,
claimed several days ago that Su had been suspected of leaking national secrets
by instructing the Ministry of the Interior to pass the oceanographic data on
Taiwan to "its counterpart under China's State Council".</P>
      <P>The DPP legislative caucus also said that it would not rule out the possibility
of charging President Ma Ying-jeou, who concurrently serves as NSC chairman, of
"offence of interference with relations with other states."</P>
      <P>Presidential spokesman Wang Yu-chi on Oct. 19 rejected Chai's allegation as
"totally groundless" and said the Presidential Office will consider filing a
lawsuit against Chai.</P>
      <P>The NSC in a press release Tuesday said that it will sue Chai for his untrue
accusations unless he apologizes within 24 hours upon receiving a legal letter
requesting rectification of a problem.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou vowed Wednesday to carry out a series of reforms to
pursue the goals of "an excellent ruling party and a powerful and efficient
government."</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while chairing a meeting of the Kuomintang's decision-making
Central Standing Committee, the first since he took over as chairman of the

      <P>To achieve excellence, he said, the KMT must uphold justice, be clean and well-
disciplined and always keep the people in mind.</P>
      <P>He said that the KMT has to transform itself into an "action party" so as to
enhance its cooperative relations with Premier Wu Den-yih's Cabinet, which Ma

    <TEXT>
      <P>An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) developed by National Cheng Kung University
(NCKU) successfully completed its maiden flight, which was a new milestone in
Taiwan's progress in the field, academic sources said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The unmanned aircraft, dubbed Spoonbill UAV, successfully flew 92 kilometers
from Taiwan proper to the outlying island of Penghu Tuesday on what was the
first flight of its kind across the Taiwan Strait, NCKU said in a press
statement.</P>
      <P>NUKU President Michael M.C. Lai, also an Academia Sinica scholar, was quoted in
the statement as saying that the unprecedented flight was not only an
achievement for the university but was also "Taiwan's pride."</P>
      <P>"It is also an important achievement in Asia, " Lai said, adding that NCKU's UAV
technology is the "cream of Taiwan" and also the "best of Asia."</P>
      <P>The NCKU research team arrived with the 30-kg aircraft early Wednesday morning
at an airstrip it had constructed on a salt flat in Cigu, Tainan County in
southwestern Taiwan to carry out the test.</P>
      <P>The team then installed the antenna and activated the mainframe computer in
preparation for the test.</P>
      <P>The Spoonbill UAV took off at 9: 20 a.m. under manual remote control, flying at
100 kph at an altitude of 300 meters toward Penghu's Dongji island.</P>
      <P>Ten minutes after takeoff it was beyond the team's field of vision and it
switched to automatic control.</P>
      <P>For about 30 minutes or so the team lost computer contact with the aircraft and
there was some anxiety over the success of the test.</P>
      <P>However,  at around 10 a.m., the mainframe computer began receiving information
from the aircraft again and the research team piloted the aircraft by remote
control to a landing at 10: 17 a.m. on Dongji islet, completing the 52-minute
historic flight.</P>
      <P>The NCKU's Remotely Piloted Vehicle &amp; Micro Satellite Research Laboratory
(RMRL) built the Spoonbill UAV in April this year after 20 years of research and
development.</P>
      <P>The aircraft measures 2.2 meters long, 3.7 meters wide and 0.9 meter high.</P>
      <P>In 2005, the team also completed a successful 16-km test flight of its Swan UAV
from Donggang in Pingtung County to the offshore Siaoliuchiu. The vehicle was
much smaller than the Spoonbill.</P>
      <P>According to Hsiao, a complete UAV should operate with the use of two major
systems -- on board systems and a ground station that allows researchers to
control the aerial vehicle's movement and monitor the video images transmitted
by the onboard camera.</P>
      <P>Hsiao said an UAV developed by Australian researchers more than a decade ago was
able to fly more than 1,000 kilometers, but the vehicle was not equipped with an
automatic flight system, onboard camera, a video transmitter or GPS aviation
system. "That vehicle lagged far behind the Spoonbill in terms of technology,"
he added.</P>
      <P>The Spoonbill's onboard systems include wireless module for wireless data link
between the aircraft and the ground control station (GCS) ; onboard surveillance
camera that takes aerial videos/images; and video transmitter that transmit
onboard video to the GCS in real time.</P>
      <P>Hsiao said that 80 percent of the Spoonbill's  parts and components were made in
Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Central Taiwan's Changhua County last week held a ceremony to celebrate the
anniversary of the believed ascension to heaven of the island's beloved goddess
Matsu, known as the protector of fishermen.</P>
      <P>The ceremony was part of the 2009 Matsu round-Changhua County blessing
procession organized by the county government to honor the widely-worshipped
goddess, and to promote the development of cultural and tourism business in the
county.</P>
      <P>Eleven local Matsu temples joined the 12-day procession which took place from
Oct. 5-16.</P>
      <P>County Magistrate Cho Po-Yuan, who presided over the religious ceremony at the
county's Fuhai Temple, expressed hope that the annual joint procession of Matsu
statues enshrined at the temples, which was first held in 2008, will continue
next year and in following years to become one of the county's cultural
features.</P>
      <P>He also reiterated the local government's determination to safeguard the rights
and benefits of local fishermen, farmers and breeders of fish and livestock.</P>
      <P>The religious event was attended by many folk arts performing troupes and groups
of sedan carriers. Their festive performances and unique ways of guarding the
goddess during the procession drew hundreds of spectators, county officials
said.</P>
      <P>According to legend, Matsu was born into a fisherman's family in Meizhou,
southern China's Fujian province in 960 AD (during the early Northern Song
Dynasty) . She was deified later for sacrificing her life to save her father and
brothers, who were fishermen.</P>
      <P>Although she was initially believed to just bless the sea for fishermen, as time
went by, people prayed to her for good health, a successful  career  or
business,  good  harvests,  and  smooth relationships.</P>
      <P>The date of Matsu's ascension to heaven is said to be on the ninth day of the
ninth lunar month, according to legend.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan will be firm on stance toward ECFA: economics minister</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan will stand firm when negotiating with China on a proposed cross-Taiwan
Strait economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) by seeking to exclude the
import of Chinese labor, agricultural products and some industrial goods from
the pact, Minister of Economic Affairs (MOEA) Shih Yen-shiang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"We will do everything possible to prevent the imports of Chinese workers as
well as China's 830 agricultural products and more than 1,000 industrial items
from being included in the accord, " Shih said when responding to lawmakers'
questions during a committee meeting of the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Citing the latest statistics compiled by China's Ministry of Commerce,
Legislator Su Chen-ching said China will benefit four times more than Taiwan if
the two sides clinch such an agreement.</P>
      <P>He accused the government of seeking to sign what he called "an unfair and
humiliating pact."</P>
      <P>But Shih refuted Su's argument, saying China's figures were assessed based on an
assumption of a full market opening by Taiwan. Shih added that his ministry has
worked out countermeasures to deal with the impact from China once an ECFA is
signed.</P>
      <P>According to the report by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, a Taiwan-China ECFA
will help China realize a 0.63 percent increase in its GDP (gross domestic
product) , or US$27 billion in value, while Taiwan will enjoy a 1.72 percent
growth in GDP, worth about US$6.9 billion.</P>
      <P>Critics of the economic agreement, which is similar to a free-trade agreement,
have said it will flood Taiwan with cheaper Chinese products and threaten
Taiwan's industries, putting many people out of work.</P>
      <P>Proponents of the agreement, including President Ma Ying-jeou, have insisted the
agreement is necessary in order to help Taiwan maintain its competitiveness, as
China is planning to sign similar trade pacts with other countries in East and
Southeast Asia, which would allow those countries to import items to China
tariff-free.</P>
      <P>In another matter, Shih reiterated that the government will not levy an energy
tax unless the economy recovers, echoing Premier Wu Den-yih's remarks in
response to a controversy arising from the planned tax.</P>
      <P>Wu said a day earlier that there would be no timetable for the proposed tax,
which is expected to double the price of gasoline products.</P>

      <P>The Higher Education Evaluation and Accreditation Council (HEEACT) of Taiwan on
Wednesday launched a personalized college search engine "College Navigator in
Taiwan, " which allows students to select the most suitable schools for them
from a list of 69 four-year comprehensive colleges and universities.</P>
      <P>HEEACT President C. Y. Chen announced the launch of the Web-based interactive
process, which took the council two years to develop. Experts from Germany,
France, the United States, Britain, Canada, and Spain, as well as Taiwanese
academicians, contributed to the effort.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the system uses a step by step process that allows users to pick
schools using 11 criteria, 24 academic indicators and 16 general information
data points.</P>
      <P>The general information includes history, enrollment, number of programs and Web
sites, student service, scholarships and tuition. The criteria cover academic
survey, student selectivity, student demographics,  faculty,  library
acquisitions,  research output, teaching quality, international outlook and
graduation rate.</P>
      <P>Indicators reflect enrollment rate,  proportion of graduate students, graduation
rate, proportion of faculty members above the position of assistant professors,
proportion of professors with advanced degrees, proportion of full-time faculty,
faculty-student ratio, total expenditure per student, number of articles
published, National Science Foundation grants per faculty,  proportion of
international students, proportion of international faculty and library
expenditure per student.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that all data was collected through academic surveys,
government databases, and directly from the 69 institutions. Users can also
select prospective schools by region, type, size and programs, according to
Chen.</P>
      <P>HEEACT was founded in 2005 under the initiative of the Ministry of Education
(MOE). With an aim to conduct MOE commissioned higher education evaluation and
accreditation, the council was formed with funding from all universities and
colleges in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>This year's program aims to present the diverse cultures in Taiwan and countries
around the world, while emphasizing environmental issues, such as global warming
and pollution in the ocean.</P>
      <P>Organizers said the 2010 TIF will try to broaden audience members' perspectives
on the arts, by offering performances by innovative groups and artists.</P>
      <P>World-famous composer Tan Dun will unveil "Crouching Tiger Double Concerto" a
symphony orchestra version of his Oscar-winning score for the movie "Crouching
Tiger, Hidden Dragon". The orchestra version will feature both oriental and
occidental instruments.</P>
      <P>The concert will also feature Tan's first internet symphony "Eroica," a piece
originally written for the YouTube network symphony project and performed by
musicians from all over the world gathered by YouTube in New York.</P>
      <P>His other piece "Earth Concerto-A Dialogue with Gustav Mahler" is considered
unique for its combination of sounds created with organic objects and the
ceramics from YiXin, China and Ying Ge, Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin Hwai-min, the founder and director of Taiwan's internationally renowned
Cloud Gate Dance Theater, will present his new work "Listening to the River,"
which was inspired by Taipei's Tamshui river.</P>
      <P>Also on the program are performances by the Taiwanese performance group Xin Xin
Nanguan, which will reinvent the emotional and poetic ancient Nanguan music with
poems written in the Song Dynasty.</P>

Staatstheaters Darmstadt dance troupe, will premiere her new work "Violett,
Lila, PurPur," a combination of Taiwanese music and literature presented in
dance theatre format.</P>
      <P>The organizer has also arranged a few programs in line with the global trend of
environmental protection and preservation of marine ecology, such as "Sirena a
la Plancha", a dance about a story of impossible love involving a woman who
transfigures into a mermaid in order to save the world but is caught by
fishermen and later seduced by a giant. The dance is staged by Sol Pico, a
modern dance company from Spain.</P>
      <P>Other highlights include an avant-garde adaptation of Shakespeare's "Hamlet" by
German director Thomas Ostermeier and French choreographer Angelin Preljocaj,
and "Drum Beat, Heart Beat!, " a performance of Mahler's Symphony No. 1 by the
National Symphony Orchestra, in collaboration with Taiwanese conductor Lu Shao-

    <HEADLINE>ECFA can create over 105,000 job opportunities in Taiwan: report</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  21 (CNA)
10/21/09  23:21:55

    <TEXT>
      <P>In a best-case senario, the proposed cross-strait economic agreement would
create 105,000 to 125,000 job opportunities in Taiwan, according to a report
released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Prof. Lin Kuo-jung, director of International Trade at the Chihlee Institute of
Technology that was commissioned by the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) to
conduct the study, weighed the impact on Taiwan if the economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) is signed and if it is not.</P>
      <P>Adopting the global trade analysis project (GTAP) model, Lin based his research
on four scenarios -- the formation of a free trade grouping among the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and China, South Korea and Japan (ASEAN
+three) without the ECFA; an ASEAN + three grouping with both Taiwan and China
denied access to each other's agricultural markets; an ASEAN + three grouping
with China opening its agricultural market and Taiwan's remaining closed; and an
ASEAN + three grouping with both Taiwan and China adopting an open market
policy.</P>
      <P>Under the third scenario, which Lin described as the most favorable to Taiwan,
the island's gross domestic product (GDP) would grow by 0.754 percent and the
number of job opportunities would increase by 125,000, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Among the various sectors, the services industry and the high-tech industry will
benefit most from a cross-strait ECFA, the study showed.</P>
      <P>However, if the ECFA is not signed, Taiwan will see its GDP drop by 0.179
percent and an additional 47,000 people would become jobless, the report stated.</P>
      <P>In this case, the most serious loss of jobs would occur in the garment, metal
and sports gear, and stationery and daily necessity industries, according to the
report.</P>
      <P>Under the second and fourth senarios, Taiwan would see a GDP growth of 0.7
percent and an increase of 100,000 job opportunities, the study showed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China are expected to discuss the ECFA issue in the upcoming talks
between the two sides in December before they formally ink such an agreement,
which aims to liberalize cross-strait trade and exchanges.</P>
      <P>The figures forecast by the CLA, however, were conservative compared to those in
a similar research report unveiled by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
July 29.</P>
      <P>The MOEA research, conducted by the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research
(CIER), put Taiwan's annual GDP growth at 1.72 percent and the increase in jobs
at between 257,000 and 263,000 if the ECFA is signed.</P>
      <P>Director Huang Zhi-peng of the MOEA's Foreign Trade Bureau, attributed the
differences in the forecasts to the methods used by the Chihlee Institute of
Technology and CIER to gauge the ECFA's impacts on Taiwan's economy.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with China will lead a high-profile Taiwanese media
delegation to visit China Oct. 28, a Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) official
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung will head the delegation of senior executives from
15 mainstream local media organizations on a five-day visit from Oct.28," said
SEF Deputy Secretary-General Ma Shao-chang.</P>
      <P>The group will spend most of its time in Beijing, visiting China's major state-
controlled media organs, such as China Central Television (CCTV), Xinhua News
Agency and People's Daily, and meeting with their management personnel, Ma said.</P>
      <P>The delegation will also hold informal meetings with China's State Council
officials  in charge of media affairs and with representatives of major Chinese
news media.</P>
      <P>Before wrapping up its visit, the group will travel to Shanxi to see historic
and cultural relics there, particularly the renowned Pingyao Old City -- a well-
preserved ancient city that has a grand city wall, residences and shops, and
even government offices all in the style of the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing
(1644-1911) dynasties. UNESCO declared Pingyao a World Cultural Heritage site in
1997.</P>
      <P>The group is scheduled to return to Taipei Nov. 1, Ma said.</P>
      <P>The SEF is a quasi-official intermediary organization authorized to handle
exchanges with China in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>The SEF's Chinese counterpart -- the Beijing-based association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait -- is helping to organize the Taiwan media group's
upcoming visit, Ma said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECFA can create over 105,000 job opportunities in Taiwan: report</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  21 (CNA)
10/21/09  23:21:55
( By Chen Shun-hsieh, Yang Shu-min &amp; Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In a best-case senario, the proposed cross-strait economic agreement would
create 105,000 to 125,000 job opportunities in Taiwan, according to a report
released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Prof. Lin Kuo-jung, director of International Trade at the Chihlee Institute of
Technology that was commissioned by the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) to
conduct the study, weighed the impact on Taiwan if the economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) is signed and if it is not.</P>
      <P>Adopting the global trade analysis project (GTAP) model, Lin based his research
on four scenarios -- the formation of a free trade grouping among the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and China, South Korea and Japan (ASEAN
+three) without the ECFA; an ASEAN + three grouping with both Taiwan and China
denied access to each other's agricultural markets; an ASEAN + three grouping
with China opening its agricultural market and Taiwan's remaining closed; and an
ASEAN + three grouping with both Taiwan and China adopting an open market
policy.</P>
      <P>Under the third scenario, which Lin described as the most favorable to Taiwan,
the island's gross domestic product (GDP) would grow by 0.754 percent and the
number of job opportunities would increase by 125,000, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Among the various sectors, the services industry and the high-tech industry will
benefit most from a cross-strait ECFA, the study showed.</P>
      <P>However, if the ECFA is not signed, Taiwan will see its GDP drop by 0.179
percent and an additional 47,000 people would become jobless, the report stated.</P>
      <P>In this case, the most serious loss of jobs would occur in the garment, metal
and sports gear, and stationery and daily necessity industries, according to the
report.</P>
      <P>Under the second and fourth senarios, Taiwan would see a GDP growth of 0.7
percent and an increase of 100,000 job opportunities, the study showed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China are expected to discuss the ECFA issue in the upcoming talks
between the two sides in December before they formally ink such an agreement,
which aims to liberalize cross-strait trade and exchanges.</P>
      <P>The figures forecast by the CLA, however, were conservative compared to those in
a similar research report unveiled by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
July 29.</P>
      <P>The MOEA research, conducted by the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research
(CIER), put Taiwan's annual GDP growth at 1.72 percent and the increase in jobs
at between 257,000 and 263,000 if the ECFA is signed.</P>
      <P>Director Huang Zhi-peng of the MOEA's Foreign Trade Bureau, attributed the
differences in the forecasts to the methods used by the Chihlee Institute of
Technology and CIER to gauge the ECFA's impacts on Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>CIER applied a dynamic GTAP model in its research, while the Chohlee institute
adopted a static one, Huang said.</P>
      <P>"If CIER had used the static method, it would have forecast an increase in job
opportunities of around 130,000, a figure not far from that projected by the
Chihlee institute," Huang explained.</P>

      <P>The 2010 Taiwan International Festival (TIF) will feature 15 productions from
nine countries which aim to amaze enthusiasts of performing arts and music in
Taiwan, the National Theater and Concert Hall (NTCH) said Wednesday,</P>
      <P>A total of 45 performances will be featured, with performance companies coming
from Spain, Denmark, Germany, France, Austria, Columbia, the United States and
the United Kingdom, in addition to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Six of the programs will be world premieres while another six will be Asian
premieres.</P>
      <P>"You will be able to witness the avant-garde works from Europe and reinvented
Taiwanese traditional art, as well as original productions that feature
'indigenous fashion' spirit," a statement on the NTCH's website said. "These
wonderful works represent the integration of artists from Taiwan and all over
the world."</P>
      <P>This year's program aims to present the diverse cultures in Taiwan and countries
around the world, while emphasizing environmental issues, such as global warming
and pollution in the ocean.</P>
      <P>Organizers said the 2010 TIF will try to broaden audience members' perspectives
on the arts, by offering performances by innovative groups and artists.</P>
      <P>World-famous composer Tan Dun will unveil "Crouching Tiger Double Concerto" a
symphony orchestra version of his Oscar-winning score for the movie "Crouching
Tiger, Hidden Dragon". The orchestra version will feature both oriental and
occidental instruments.</P>
      <P>The concert will also feature Tan's first internet symphony "Eroica," a piece
originally written for the YouTube network symphony project and performed by
musicians from all over the world gathered by YouTube in New York.</P>
      <P>His other piece "Earth Concerto-A Dialogue with Gustav Mahler" is considered
unique for its combination of sounds created with organic objects and the
ceramics from YiXin, China and Ying Ge, Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin Hwai-min, the founder and director of Taiwan's internationally renowned
Cloud Gate Dance Theater, will present his new work "Listening to the River,"
which was inspired by Taipei's Tamshui river.</P>
      <P>Also on the program are performances by the Taiwanese performance group Xin Xin
Nanguan, which will reinvent the emotional and poetic ancient Nanguan music with
poems written in the Song Dynasty.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-born Lin Mei Hong, the artistic director of Germany's Tanztheater des
Staatstheaters Darmstadt dance troupe, will premiere her new work "Violett,
Lila, PurPur," a combination of Taiwanese music and literature presented in
dance theatre format.</P>
      <P>The organizer has also arranged a few programs in line with the global trend of
environmental protection and preservation of marine ecology, such as "Sirena a
la Plancha", a dance about a story of impossible love involving a woman who
transfigures into a mermaid in order to save the world but is caught by
fishermen and later seduced by a giant. The dance is staged by Sol Pico, a
modern dance company from Spain.</P>
      <P>Other highlights include an avant-garde adaptation of Shakespeare's "Hamlet" by
German director Thomas Ostermeier and French choreographer Angelin Preljocaj,
and "Drum Beat, Heart Beat!, " a performance of Mahler's Symphony No. 1 by the
National Symphony Orchestra, in collaboration with Taiwanese conductor Lu Shao-
chia and Martin Grubinger, a percussionist from Austria.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, in his capacity as chairman  of the ruling  Kuomintang,
announced  Wednesday  an unconventional move to have the party's decision-making
Central Standing Committee (CSC) hold meetings around the island as a strategy
to mobilize grassroots support.</P>
      <P>The president said that as the elections for city mayor and county magistrates
are only about 40 days away, the KMT would demonstrate its flexibility as a
"mobilized party."</P>
      <P>He has instructed that the CSC hold meetings in five counties, namely Yilan and
Hsinchu in the northern Taiwan, Nantou in the central region, and Chiayi and
Pingtung in the south, in the coming weeks, to hear grassroots opinions and to
lend support to the KMT candidates' campaigns.</P>
      <P>The five counties were chosen because a tug of war is expected between the KMT
candidates and their opponents there, Ma said.</P>

      <P>Laborers must have a say in talks on a proposed cross-strait economic agreement,
as it would impact most heavily on blue-collar workers in Taiwan,
representatives of the country's labor sector insisted Thursday.</P>
      <P>The heads of the Labor Rights Association and Taiwan Labor Front pushed for
labor representatives to be included in talks on the economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) with China, saying that the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) has not made enough of an effort to have labor represented in the
negotiations.</P>
      <P>Labor Rights Association CEO Wang Chuan-ping said the ECFA would have the
greatest implications  for workers,  rather than for industries. However, no
member of any labor group has been invited by the MOEA, the key planner on the
Taiwan side, to take part in the meetings and seminars on the proposed
agreement, she complained.</P>
      <P>Even though some legislators have spoken out on behalf of domestic laborers
regarding the ECFA implications, Wang said, "they hardly represent the voice of
labor."</P>
      <P>She accused the MOEA and the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) of providing empty,
speculative data on the possible impact of the ECFA on laborers.</P>
      <P>"Only the forecast that some workers may face salary cuts or end up jobless is
thought to be accurate," she added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Sun You-lien, secretary-general of the Taiwan Labor Front, complained
that several labor groups have contacted the MOEA and CLA for assessment reports
and relevant data concerning the ECFA plan, but have been told that such
information is classified.</P>
      <P>Sun suggested that in addition to taking the "passive" approach of granting
subsidies to workers and industries, the government should devise more
"constructive" measures to help create employment for those laborers who will
lose their jobs as a result of the ECFA.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, the establishment of big nursing home communities around
the country can help create a large number of long-term jobs for people in that
field.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung  Harbor Bureau (KHB) Director-General Shieh Ming-hui is scheduled to
leave for China Thursday to discuss a plan to establish a new shipping route to
the port of Taicang.</P>
      <P>Shieh will take part in a cross-Taiwan Strait port logistics forum to be held in
Taicang, Jiangsu province and meet with Taicang officials to discuss possible
cooperation plans between Kaohsiung and Taicang.</P>
      <P>According to Shieh, the main purpose of the visit is to seek to expand cross-
strait shipping routes and capacity now that there are direct transportation
links between the two sides.</P>
      <P>In the process,  the port of Kaohsiung aims to become a cross-strait
transshipment and logistics center, Shieh said.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-yu, chief of the KHB's Business Department, who was already in
Taicang preparing for Shieh's visit, told the CNA that the proposed Kaohsiung-
Taicang route is intended for small, short sea shipping vessels of around 1,000
tons.</P>
      <P>The cargo shipped from Taicang to Kaohsiung can be transshipped to Southeast
Asia, and even Europe and Americas in the future, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Zhu Jiabao, an official at the Taicang Port Authority, expressed the hope that
the two sides can finalize the details of the proposed route next month to
facilitate its early launch.</P>
      <P>Such a route is badly needed because the shipping lanes between Taicang and the
Taiwan ports of Keelung and Taichung are near capacity, Zhu said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Typhoon Lupit continues to slow down, which will prolong its influence on
Taiwan, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>The typhoon's periphery, combined with the northeastern monsoon, brought rain to
northern and eastern Taiwan Wednesday and the wet weather is expected to
continue, although the storm is weakening, CWB meteorologists said.</P>
      <P>The northern and eastern parts of the island are expected to continue to
experience rain until Oct. 28, the bureau forecast.</P>
      <P>At 11 a.m. Thursday, the storm was centered about 540 km east-southeast of
Taiwan's southernmost tip of Eluanbi, moving at a speed of 9-5 kph in a west-
southwesterly direction toward the northern region of Luzon Island in the
Philippines, the forecasters said.</P>
      <P>As the Pacific high pressure system dissipates and the storm continues to slow
down, it could change course Friday or Saturday and move in a more northerly
direction toward Taiwan, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>If this happens, the CWB said, it will issue a sea warning against Lupit Friday,
at the earliest. However, the weather bureau said it may not have to issue any
warning if the storm continues to lose strength.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the CWB forecast that temperatures islandwide will drop to an average
low of 21 degrees Celsius Thursday, about 2 degrees lower than the average
recorded the day before. The highs Thursday are forecast at 25 degrees in the
north, 28 degrees in the east and 30 degrees in central and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In related news, officials in Lanyu, or Orchid Island, off Taiwan's eastern
county of Taitung, closed schools and offices Thursday afternoon after
hurricane-force winds whipped the island Thursday morning.</P>
      <P>The winds are expected to strengthen in the next few days as Typhoon Lupit's
periphery approaches the Bashi Channel and Taiwan, said Lanyu township chief
Chou Kuei-kuang.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Whiskered terns arrive in Tainan, expected to stay longer this year</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>As winter approaches, tens of thousands of whiskered terns have arrived in the
southern county of Tainan, but the county government  has decided  not to host
tern-watching activities this year in an effort to protect the birds, county
officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The birds' "sunset dance, " in which tens of thousands of black-bellied terns
fly in flocks over the ocean at sunset, last year attracted thousands of weekend
tourists to the rural township of Beimen.</P>
      <P>However, the convergence of large numbers of tourists on the area caused the
birds to leave sooner than usual.</P>
      <P>Hung Yu-chih, a local guide who is familiar with the birds' migratory habits,
said the whiskered terns, which normally would have stayed until April this
year, left Tainan at the end of last December.</P>
      <P>Last year, more than 10,000 people visited Tainan to watch whiskered terns, said
Hung, who also runs a guesthouse in Beimen for bird lovers. "The noisy crowds of
visitors seriously disturbed the terns," he said</P>
      <P>The black-bellied terns -- small marsh terns with a slightly forked tail --
migrate to the coastal areas around Tainan and Chiayi County every winter.
During their stay in the wetlands in Beimen near northern Tainan, they usually
fly out to sea early in the morning and rest on the oyster racks then return to
the wetlands at sunset.</P>
      <P>Some bird watchers said that in addition to watching the unique "tornado-like"
flight of the birds at sunset, they like to get up early to see them at dawn.</P>
      <P>"It was amazing...they were flying so low that it seemed like they were just
above our heads, " a bird watcher said, describing his experience.</P>
      <P>Hung said he was worried that the whiskered terns, which left early last year,
would not return this year. However, they began arriving in September and the
numbers are expected to grow to a peak in November, he noted.</P>
      <P>Although the first-ever tern-watching activity sponsored last year by the Tainan
County government drew lots of tourists to the area, many of them criticized the
lack of adequate facilities for bird watching.</P>
      <P>This year, the Tainan County government will focus on educating bird watchers
rather than on attracting visitors.</P>
      <P>Even so, Hung is worried that the birds migratory pattern might be disturbed
again.</P>
      <P>"I really hope the bird watchers will keep their voices down, " said Hung, "I
don't want to see the birds leaving early again."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The proposed signing of an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
between Taiwan and China will be a mutually beneficial move, rather than a zero-
sum game, the Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) Director-General Huang Chih-peng
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Huang made the comment in response to concerns that the ECFA would be
unfavorable to Taiwan because China would obviously benefit more from the
agreement.</P>
      <P>According to a report released recently by China's Ministry of Commerce, tariff
reductions resulting from the ECFA are expected to boost China's gross domestic
product (GDP) by 0.63 percentage points, or more than US$27 billion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a study commissioned by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and
conducted by Taiwan's Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research shows that the
ECFA could push up Taiwan's GDP by 1.72 percentage points, or US$6.9 billion.</P>
      <P>Huang said that while comparing the increase in GDP on the two sides, the public
should realize that these are extra benefits that would be non-existent without
the ECFA.</P>
      <P>Gains for Taiwan will not mean losses for China or vice versa, he said, adding
that Taiwan should go ahead and sign the agreement with China as long as it
would bring more benefits than disadvantages.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih on Thursday instructed relevant Cabinet agencies to take
measures to prepare early against approaching Typhoon Lupit, saying that the
more people prepare themselves, the less they will suffer.</P>
      <P>Wu has asked the National Disaster Prevention and Protection Commission to
maintain close contact with local governments for timely issuance of evacuation
orders or pre-warning against flooding and mudslides as the typhoon approaches,
according to Executive Yuan spokesman Su Jun-pin.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Underwater archaeology exhibition opens at Shihsanhang museum</HEADLINE>

      <P>An exhibition that promises to offer a fascinating insight into the world of
underwater archaeology and the history of ancient maritime links between Taiwan
and China is being held at the Shihsanhang Museum of Archaeology in Bali, Taipei
County until Dec. 13.</P>
      <P>Under the theme Diving into History, the exhibition is composed of six divisions
that feature a wide range of biological fossils from the Taiwan Strait that date
back 40,000 years, an array of underwater cultural and historic assets, and a
virtual underwater archaeological site, according to Lee Li-fang, a Council for
Cultural Affairs (CCA) official who is one of the organizers of the exhibition.</P>
      <P>Other highlights include 20 artifacts retrieved from a sunken Chinese Qianlong
period (1736-1796) vessel that was named General No. 1 after Penghu's General
Islet where it was discovered by fishermen in 1994, Lee said.</P>
      <P>According to unofficial statistics based on sunken ship records, there are an
estimated 500 sunken vessels in the Taiwan Strait, said Ho Chuan-kun, director
of the Department of Anthropology at the National Museum of Natural Science in
Taichung City, who is another exhibition organizer.</P>
      <P>However, only about 10 sunken vessels have been located in a recent marine
census conducted by the CCA, Ho added.</P>
      <P>Because Taiwan lacks expertise in underwater archaeology, the CCA has sought
international help in an effort to catch up with the more advanced countries in
this field, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>To this end, the CCA in 2007 signed a four-year cooperative memorandum of
understanding (MOU)  with France's Department of Underwater  and Undersea
Archaeological  Research (DRASSM)  for assistance in identifying and
authenticating what was believed to be an ancient sunken vessel that was
discovered during the dredging of Magong Harbor in Penghu, Lee said.</P>
      <P>However, no wreckage was found during the underwater exploration of the site by
local experts and seven DRASSM archaeologists, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>Under the MOU,  France will assist Taiwan with underwater archaeology projects
and the two sides have jointly published two books on the topic, Lee added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has had marine links with China for 400 years and there are a number of
sunken ships in the Taiwan Strait, said Wang Show-lai of the CCA's Headquarters
Administration of Cultural Heritage.</P>
      <P>The government should therefore seek to build underwater archaeology expertise
in the country, Wang urged.</P>
      <P>As historic heritage, artifacts and treasure recovered from sunken vessels are
all considered  as tourism resources,  the government  should  set up a marine
department  or underwater archaeology agency to preserve these treasures, Lee
suggested.</P>
      <P>The Shihsanhang Museum of Archaeology, which was constructed at a cost of NT$380
million, is a major archaeology museum in Taiwan and an education center.</P>
      <P>The museum was established with the aim of preserving and displaying artifacts
unearthed at the Shihsanhang site.</P>
      <P>Shihsanhang, which means "13 stores" in Chinese, was a port city that was known
for extensive commerce and trade during the Qing dynasty.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei's controversial new Muzha-Neihu MRT Line experienced a 47-minute shutdown
Thursday after a network failure happened at its Jiannan station at 9:17 a.m.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time that the 14.8-km Muzha-Neihu line had to suspend
services since the system upgrades carried out by the Canadian contractor
Bombardier were completed at the end of August.</P>
      <P>According to the MRT management company Taipei Rapid Transit Corp.'s (TRTC) Vice
President Chao Hsiung-fei, 34 trains were in operation when the halt in service
happened.</P>
      <P>Two trains were caught between stations and had to be manually driven into the
stations. The entire line resumed normal operations at 10:04 a. m.</P>
      <P>An initial investigation showed that the shut down might be caused by a network
failure at the Jiannan Station, Chao said, adding that the effect of network
optimization will be assessed further by the contractor Bombardier.</P>
      <P>He also said Bombardier will propose another long term network optimization
plan, in which another network system will be used to replace the existing one.
The replacement network system will begin operation as early as January 2010.</P>
      <P>Taipei's city government said in September that the system had become more
stable after a series of upgrades, including ATM ( asynchronous transfer mode)
network optimization, which confines problems to a specific section of the line
or a single station when a signal fails, instead of grounding the whole system.</P>
      <P>The new subway line, which combines the Muzha section that was built by French
contractor Matra Co. in the 1990s and the new Neihu section built by Bombardier,
has experienced eight major emergency shutdowns since its inauguration on July
4.</P>
      <P>The subway management company suspended operations over two weekends in August
to enable the contractor to fine tune the system's software and conduct tests.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The top United States envoy to Taiwan on Thursday clarified his recent comments
on the trial of former President Chen Shui-bian, saying that he has no intention
of interfering in Taiwans internal affairs.</P>
      <P>William Stanton, the director of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), which
represents U.S. interests in the country in the absence of official ties, for
the first time made public remarks about his comments on Chens trial in his
Sept. 30 meeting with Minister of Justice Wang Ching-feng.</P>
      <P>His comments triggered criticisms from some legislators, local media and
pundits, who accused him of interfering in Taiwans domestic matters.</P>
      <P>In the course of the discussion of many issues, I just simply noted that there
have been some people in the U.S. who commented about the trial of the former
president and expressed concern,said Stanton, in response to a reporters
question at his first official meeting with local media after taking office two
months ago.</P>
      <P>But it was not an extended discussion and I certainly didnt advocate any
particular view on the issue,he added.</P>
      <P>In his 31 years experience in foreign service, Stanton said, he has learnt that
diplomats should never interfere with other countries internal affairs.</P>
      <P>According to Stanton, Chens trial was not a principle topic during his
introductory meeting with Wang, but rather they focused on discussing the issue
of a Taiwan-U.S. extradition agreement and some bilateral training programs that
Taiwanese judges and prosecutors have participated in, he added.</P>
      <P>Both Chen and his wife Wu Shu-chen were sentenced on Sept. 11 by the Taipei
District Court to life in prison, in addition to receiving fines of NT$200
million (US$6.13 million) and NT$300 million, respectively, on several counts of
corruption, including embezzling from a presidential fund for state affairs,
taking bribes from local businessmen and money laundering.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court ruled Oct. 9 that Chen, who has been detained since Dec.
30 last year, should remain in custody, on the grounds that he might abscond if
released from detention.</P>
      <P>Overseas scholars and legal experts have raised concerns about the case, with
some saying Chen has been treated in an excessively harsh manner.</P>
      <P>The court and prosecutors, however, have argued Chen should simply face justice
for his crimes, while many Taiwanese people believe Chen should be punished if
found guilty, and some see Chen's conviction as an improvement in Taiwan's
justice system, as even a president can be convicted.</P>

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials
Thursday:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>The Constitutional Court, at the request of ex-President Chen, confirmed the
constitutionality of detention of suspects who were indicted for felony, but
added an extra condition that there should also be reason to believe that the
suspect might escape or coach witnesses to give false testimony.</P>
      <P>We affirm the court's decision to uphold the detention of felony suspects
although we do not see eye to eye with the court on condition it attached to
detention.</P>
      <P>However, we think this is an acceptable compromise as the court had to silence
the criticisms from ex-President Chen and his followers.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Prices of fuel and electricity should be raised but not be offset by cuts in
other taxes</P>
      <P>A tax-reforming panel under the Executive Yuan suggested on Oct. 19 the
imposition of energy taxes to push up the prices of fuel and electricity by 35
percent to 57 percent over 10 years.</P>
      <P>Finance minister said the expected hike in fuel and electricity prices would be
offset by a reduction in other taxes, such as income tax and commodity tax.</P>
      <P>We agree with the panel's view that the prices of fuel and electricity in Taiwan
are too low in comparison with that of other countries and should be raised.</P>
      <P>However, the unreasonable low prices are the results of the government's long-
term policy aimed at boosting economic development. The problem can be settled
by simply raising the prices which are under the government's control without
having to resort to imposing new taxes.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the new taxes which would be indirect taxes in nature should not be
offset by cuts in existing taxes, such as income tax, which is a kind of direct
tax.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>How could Ma try to replenish government coffers with new taxes?</P>
      <P>The Ma administration is floating the idea of new energy taxes which will be
imposed to replenish the government's empty coffers.</P>
      <P>Taiwan posted a tax revenue shortfall of NT$200 billion in the first eight
months of this year because of the sluggish economy and the squandering  of the
country's financial resources by Ma's administration.</P>
      <P>In addition, Ma has failed to deliver on his campaign promise of boosting the
country's economic growth to 6 percent per year, a failure that has contributed
to the tax revenue shortfall.</P>
      <P>It is a shame that the president is trying to fool the people and cover up his
administration's bungling by imposing new taxes.</P>
      <P>Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>Modernization of Taiwan's military is becoming difficult</P>
      <P>The obstacles  to Taiwan's moderation  of its military is increasing as the
United States is more reluctant to sell arms to Taiwan for the purpose of
pleasing Beijing.</P>
      <P>Local pacifists have advocated the reduction of the defense budget in favor of
budgets to improve people's livelihood, not to mention Beijing's opposition to
arms sales by whichever country to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Last but not the least is the deteriorating morale of the armed forces, which
undermine the country's war readiness.</P>

      <P>An earthquake measuring 4.6 on the Richter scale struck central and southern
Taiwan at 11: 36 a.m. Thursday, but no immediate damage was reported.</P>
      <P>According to the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) , the epicenter of the earthquake
was located 16 km south of central Taiwan's Chiayi City at a depth of 11 km.</P>
      <P>Although the quake had a magnitude of only 1.0 in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung
City, the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) temporarily suspended its traffic
service from Kaohsiung to Taichung City, as a precautionary measure.</P>
      <P>According to the THSRC, the company canceled two trains after the quake struck,
and stopped selling tickets for about 80 minutes. The ticket window resumed
normal operations at 12:55 p.m.</P>
      <P>The quake had an intensity of 2.0 in Chiayi City and Tainan City.
Coincidentally, a quake measuring 6.4 affected Chiayi on the same day 10 years
ago, with seven houses destroyed at that time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S., Taiwan to seek 'gradual approach' to beef issue: envoy</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 22 (CNA)
10/22/09  17:56:36
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States and Taiwan have agreed to seek a gradual approach to resolving
the long-running issue of Taiwan's restrictions on U.S. beef imports, William
Stanton, the top U.S. envoy to Taiwan, said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"I think the government is understandably  concerned about sensitivities,
people's concerns about beef, " Stanton said at his first official press
conference since he took office two months ago.</P>
      <P>Stanton said that the first step to strengthening economic and trade relations
between Taiwan and the U.S. would be to "get over the hurdle of beef."</P>
      <P>"I think there has been an interest in a gradual approach to the reopening of
the market. We want, in the most cooperative, detailed and careful way, to roll
out this decision," he added.</P>
      <P>Asked why Taiwan and the U.S. have not yet sealed the deal after months of
saying the issue is in final stages of discussion, Stanton said there has been
an agreement in principle for quite a while, as U.S. beef has met all the
criteria of international organizations that review beef safety.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks the discussions have been largely procedural, rather than
focused on the fundamental agreement, he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is expected to reopen its market soon to imports of U.S. bone-in beef,
according to recent statements by both President Ma Ying-jeou and Vice Premier
Eric Liluan Chu on the resolution of the issue.</P>
      <P>Taiwan at present allows importations of boneless U.S. beef from cattle younger
than 30 months, but the government is considering agreeing to a U.S. request to
allow imports of U.S. beef from all cattle younger than 30 months , and some
beef with bones, as long as the parts considered potentially risky are removed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan banned U.S. beef in 2003 when a case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE) -- also called mad cow disease -- was diagnosed in Seattle. The ban was
lifted in April 2005 to allow imports of U.S. de-boned beef from cattle under 30
months, but the Taiwan government reimposed the ban two months later when a
second BSE case was discovered in the U.S.</P>
      <P>In 2006, the DOH agreed to allow beef imports once again, but only boneless beef
from cattle younger than 30 months, produced by certified slaughterhouses and
without any risky parts, such as brains,  skulls,  eyes, spinal nerve roots,
tonsils and small intestines.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years, U.S. beef imports have been increasing year-on-year.
In 2008, imports of U.S. beef to Taiwan amounted to a record US$136 million
despite the restrictions on bone-in beef.</P>
      <P>At present, the U.S. supplies around 32 percent of Taiwan's beef, with the rest
coming mainly from New Zealand and Australia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Paiwan musicologist's passion breathes new life into tribal music</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/22/09  18:11:24
(With report by Chen Shun-hsieh)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Located in a remote mountainous  village,  the tiny Taiwu Elementary School in
southern Taiwan might have only 44 students, but it has nevertheless gained
international recognition through its 19-member choir that is dedicated to
singing the traditional songs of the Paiwan tribe.</P>
      <P>The choir, which is the brainchild and passion of choirmaster, schoolteacher and
musicologist Camake Valaule, was formed to raise cultural awareness and preserve
the musical heritage of the Paiwan, which with 86,000 people is the third most
populous of Taiwan's 14 recognized indigenous tribes.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's indigenous  peoples have lived on the island for thousands of years,
long before waves of Han settlers arrived from China.</P>
      <P>Now, however, there are fewer than 500,000 indigenous people among Taiwan's
population of 23 million, and modernization and assimilation into mainstream
society has led to the disappearance or near disappearance of many aboriginal
traditions, including their music.</P>
      <P>Many indigenous people today are unaware of their musical legacy, a problem
compounded in the Paiwan tribe by their lack of a written language, meaning that
songs have had to be handed down verbally from one generation to the next.</P>
      <P>But this is changing, thanks to the efforts of Camake and the school's choir,
who have preserved many of the old and almost forgotten Paiwan tunes, garnering
widespread attention for the Paiwan culture.</P>
      <P>The children from the tribe's Taiwu and Jiasing settlements in the southernmost
county of Pingtung first rose to prominence in 2003 when one of their songs
captured first prize in a national aboriginal singing contest.</P>
      <P>Three years later, in 2006, the Taiwu school choir was officially formed, and
since then, the choir's mission of maintaining the tribe's musical heritage has
drawn ever-increasing support and recognition.</P>
      <P>In addition to having their songs included in various music recordings, the
choir has also received numerous invitations to perform all over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This year, it traveled across the Taiwan Strait to Shanghai twice for cultural
exchanges with Chinese minority ethnic groups, and in June, the group earned a
rare opportunity to perform in Belgium, Luxembourg, France and Germany.</P>
      <P>"The choir won great acclaim for its performances, " Camake recalled in a recent
interview. "It is our adherence to tradition that distinguishes our choir from
others."</P>
      <P>Camake said the choir's rise to fame came as a bit of a surprise and was not
part of his original plan.</P>
      <P>"My principal aim was to collect and document our traditional songs so that our
youngsters could learn about their ancestors' musical legacy and way of life,"
the 30-year-old teacher said.</P>
      <P>Camake said the centuries-old ballads and songs presented by the choir can help
Paiwan children take pride in their identity, an attitude that he believes is
vital to success.</P>
      <P>"We are a tribe known for our rich heritage of mythology and artistry. We love
to sing and traditionally, music has imbued our everyday lives with color and
meaning," he said with obvious pride.</P>
      <P>For the Paiwan people, their songs are a means of expressing personal feelings
and narrating the tribe's history or tales of a settlement, a clan or social
class, Camake explained. In order to teach them to his choir, Camake first
needed to record them being sung by Paiwan elders, who are known in the tribal
language as vuvu.</P>
      <P>Each song, whether a love ballad or a ritual chant, should be sung with strict
adherence to certain tones, styles and traditions, he said.</P>
      <P>Take the song titled Bulaqa -- a piece that is usually sung by the daughter of a
chieftain in Jiasing settlement before her wedding ceremony. In the song, the
bride not only thanks her parents, but also narrates glorious aspects of her
family's history to inform the guests about her aristocratic bloodline.</P>
      <P>Sikiqeci, meanwhile, is sung by a homecoming warrior or hunter to chronicle his
clan's history and relate his acts of courage during his expedition.</P>
      <P>As the Paiwan tribe has no written history -- all tribal knowledge and folklore
is handed down orally -- Camake said it is not always easy to understand what
the lyrics of many of the tribal songs mean.</P>
      <P>With the patience and generous assistance of the Jiasing and Taiwu elders,
Camake said, he has managed over the past six years to document and record more
than 40 traditional songs, including love ballads, work songs, nursery rhymes,
warrior chants and festive melodies.</P>
      <P>However, he has also encountered some setbacks, as several clans with a
relatively higher status are not disposed to sharing their exclusive ancient
songs, a reluctance that Camake attributes to a "superiority complex."</P>
      <P>"They do not like to hear non-noble tribesmen singing their clan's exclusive
songs or to see those tunes disseminated outside their settlements," Camake said
with a sigh.</P>
      <P>Despite repeated lobbying, the Taiwu chieftain has not yet agreed to allow
Camake to document the traditional songs that belong exclusively to his clan.</P>
      <P>Another challenge lies in the fact that each Paiwan tribal settlement has its
own singing style and rhythm pattern, Camake went on.</P>
      <P>However, the young musicologist's strong sense of mission to preserve and pass
on his tribe's history and culture spurs him to continue with his efforts to
surmount the challenges he faces.</P>
      <P>Over the years, he has traveled extensively around the isolated village, which
sits on Beidawu Mountain at an elevation of 750 meters, visiting tribal elders
to record their songs. When he returns home, he practices the songs he has
recorded over and over again, a laborious process, but one that has produced
rewarding results.</P>
      <P>"Our choir members can now sing many ancient ballads that sadly, even their
parents do not know, " he said. "This has led a number of these parents to
reflect on their ignorance of their tribal musical heritage and to think about
what they can do to save and protect our indigenous culture."</P>
      <P>One of Camake's colleagues, Idis Chiu, who assists with teaching the choir the
tribal language, described Paiwan music as lusty and brilliant, fully reflecting
the tribe's vitality.</P>
      <P>"Our music is closely related to each tribal settlement's natural environment
and everyday life, and many of our tribal songs are richly melodious," she
noted.</P>
      <P>At first,  Chiu recalled,  some of the children were not particularly interested
in the old songs because they were so different from the modern pop tunes they
were more familiar with.</P>
      <P>"But after training and performing away from the school, their interest began to
grow and they are now enchanted with the music, " she said.</P>
      <P>The school has also arranged for tribal elders to practice and perform with the
children, Chiu went on, adding that some of the old vuvus have been moved to
tears by the experience, as they never thought the almost-forgotten songs would
come to life again and that they themselves would have the opportunity to play a
role in their revival.</P>
      <P>To better preserve and promote the ancient Paiwan songs, Camake said he has
begun cataloguing the music he has documented all these years in preparation for
asking friends familiar with musical theory to transcribe them into musical
notation.</P>
      <P>Camake said the 40-plus songs collected so far are just a beginning.  "The next
stage will focus on documenting the songs of festive rituals, as well as the
tunes chanted by tribal shamans when communicating with the ancestral spirits, "
he elaborated.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he said, he will try again to communicate with the Taiwu chieftain in
an effort to make him and his family understand that the purpose of documenting
and recording his clan's ancient tunes is not to take them away but rather to
save them for posterity.</P>
      <P>"I'll continue to champion the cause of restoring and promoting our musical
heritage, as we should not forget our culture and our traditions... and it is
the young people who will have to carry on my work," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Clinic doctor investigated over swine flu death</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A doctor at a clinic in Sanchong City in Taipei County came under investigation
by prosecutors Thursday after local health authorities accused him of
dereliction of duty in a fatal case of influenza A(HINI).</P>
      <P>Yang Yao-cheng, a department chief at the county's health bureau, said the case
has been handed over to the Bianciao Prosecutors' Office for investigation into
the Oct. 20 death of a 39-year-old female resident of Sanchong City.</P>
      <P>According to Yang, the investigation was launched because the relatives of the
woman accused the attending doctor, surnamed Tan, of failing to administer
proper treatment to the woman after she tested positive for influenza A(H1N1) at
the clinic Oct. 13.</P>
      <P>She was diagnosed two days after she developed fever and a cough, but instead of
being treated with anti-viral medication, she was given four bags of intravenous
fluids on Tan's orders, Yang said.</P>
      <P>The doctor claimed that the clinic had not been supplied with the anti-viral
drug Tamiflu, he added.</P>
      <P>Tan denied the accusation, and said that he suggested that the patient be
transferred to another institution for better treatment.</P>
      <P>But Yang said, the doctor did not issue a formal order until Oct. 15, when the
women's condition began to worsen.</P>
      <P>She was transferred to a hospital intensive care unit Oct. 16 after it was
confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that she had contracted the
A(H1N1) virus.</P>
      <P>The woman's husband also developed flu symptoms on Oct. 12, but he tested
negative for influenza A(H1N1).</P>
      <P>The woman's family members questioned why the doctor did not give her anti-viral
medication, and they filed a complaint with the health bureau seeking
compensation from the clinic.</P>
      <P>The woman, who had no history of chronic diseases, died on Oct. 20 -- the 26th
victim of influenza A(H1N1) in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The day before, the case of a 54-year-old man with underlying medical conditions
was recorded as the 25th H1N1 fatality in the country.</P>
      <P>According to the Central Epidemics Command Center (CECC) under the Cabinet-level
Department of Health, there have been a total of 401 hospitalized cases of H1N1
across Taiwan, and 25 patients are still in hospitals.</P>
      <P>As of Wednesday afternoon, 646 classes in 351 schools around the country had
remained closed because of H1N1 infections among the students. The number of
affected classes account for 0.43 percent of the total, according to the CECC.</P>
      <P>The CDC has recently warned that a second wave of H1N1 is looming in Taiwan and
the outbreak is expected to peak in November, after an earlier peak in
September.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the DOH is scheduled to launch a free nationwide inoculation program
from Nov. 1, targeting selected groups considered at risk of developing serious
complications from H1N1 infections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Defense ministry to consider proposal to mothball Mirage fighters</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of National Defense Kao Hua-chu promised Thursday to consider a
proposal to mothball the Air Force's Mirage fighter jets in light of their low
performance and high maintenance costs.</P>
      <P>Kao said the Ministry of National Defense (MND) will carefully evaluate issues
such as how to maintain the balance of combat capabilities across the Taiwan
Strait, before making a decision on the matter.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the Air Force will work with the French manufacturer in an
effort to fix the problems with the turbine blades of the jet engines so as to
upgrade the aircraft's performance, he said.</P>
      <P>The proposal to mothball the Mirage fighters was put forward by ruling
Kuomintang Legislator Lin Yu-fang during a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's
Foreign and National Defense Committee.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the rupture of the engine turbine blades on Mirage 2000
fighters in May resulted in a drop of pilots' average flight hours to six hours
that month, which was only 40 percent of the minimum 15 hours required by the
MND.</P>
      <P>Lin also pointed to the exorbitant costs involved in maintaining the Mirage
fleet.</P>
      <P>While the maintenance costs of the F-16 fighters and the Indigenous Defense
Fighter (IDF) are NT$160,000 and NT$250,000 per flight hour, respectively, it
costs NT$800,000 per flight hour to maintain the Mirage jets, he said.</P>
      <P>Also during the meeting, Kao denied an Apple Daily report that a F-5E aircraft
was almost shot down by an F-16 fighter in a recent aerial gunnery training
exercise.</P>
      <P>Kao told lawmakers that fire from the F-16 fighter hit only the cable to which
the aerial gunnery target on the F-5E jet was attached. The F-5E was serving as
a towing aircraft in the training exercise, he added.</P>
      <P>He said when the cable was hit, the F-16 fighter was 2,000 feet away from the
towing aircraft, and it is untrue to say that the F-5E "was almost shot down."</P>

      <P>Protests conducted legally will be allowed during the next round of talks
between top negotiators from Taiwan and mainland China, which are scheduled to
be held in Taichung City in December, Taiwan's top police officer said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF),
is scheduled to meet with his Chinese counterpart, Chen Yunlin, president of the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , in
December at a Taichung hotel yet to be finalized.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a hearing at the Legislative  Yuan,  Wang Cho-chiun, director-
general of the National Police Agency, said not only will legal protests be
allowed during the next Chiang-Chen talks, "the protesters will be seen and
heard" as well.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator William Lai complained that
the local police over-enforced their duties during the last Chiang-Chen meeting
held in Taiwan. The meeting took place in Taipei in November 2008.</P>
      <P>Lai accused the police of confiscating protesters' flags and of illegally
entering a road-side store during their enforcement.</P>
      <P>Thousands of police officers, including riot police, were mobilized in Taipei in
early November 2008 during Chen's historic visit to Taiwan when the opposition
party launched a series of protests against his visit.</P>
      <P>Chen and Chiang sealed four agreements in Taipei then on the expansion of direct
cross-strait flights, the launch of direct cross-strait shipping and postal
services and the establishment of a reporting mechanism for food safety issues.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, ruling Kuomintang Legislator Chi Kuo-tung suggested that in order to
prevent undesirable accidents from occurring during the ARATS head's upcoming
visit to Taichung, the Taiwan hosts should move the next Chiang-Chen meeting to
western Taiwan's Yunlin County.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the meeting be held at a Yunlin venue where there is only one
way in and one way out.</P>
      <P>"The police will be able to control the situation, even if thousands of
protesters swamp the venue since there will only be one entry and exit," he
noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan should not be worried about U.S.-China summit: envoy</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should not be concerned about the upcoming meeting between U.S. President
Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart Hu Jintao, as the two countries seeking
a more cooperative relationship is in the interests of the world, the top U.S.
envoy to Taiwan said Thursday.</P>
      <P>A simple fact is that China is clearly one of the most important countries in
the world. So its in everybodys interests, including Taiwan's as well, that the
U.S. try to have a cooperative relationship with China,said William Stanton,
director of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), at his first official
meeting with local media after assuming office two months ago.</P>
      <P>President Obama is scheduled to pay his first state visit to China on Nov. 15
after attending the Nov. 12-14 leaders summit of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum in Singapore. Some local Taiwanese media have raised concerns
about whether Obamas trip will affect Washington-Taipei relations.</P>
      <P>Noting that U.S. policies toward Taiwan under the Obama administration have not
changed and are still based on the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), Stanton said
although he believed the Taiwan issue would be raised during the meeting between
Obama and Hu, the two will focus on discussing global issues, such as climate
change and regional issues.</P>
      <P>I dont think we can expect any surprises in that regard, Stanton said, adding
that he has not heard any concerns about that meeting raised either by members
of the government or by the opposition in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under the Taiwan Relations Act, which was passed in 1979 after Washington
established diplomatic relations with Beijing and severed formal diplomatic ties
with Taipei, the U.S. is obliged to guarantee defensive arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the issue of Chinas growing military strength and influence in the region,
Stanton said its no secret that the U.S. government has been taking note of
Chinese military power in many of its own military assessments and reports, in
which the U.S. does not agree with Chinas assessment of what potential
international wars are, nor does it accept the definition of the economic zones.</P>
      <P>Stanton, the de facto U.S. ambassador to Taiwan in the absence of formal
diplomatic relations, reiterated the U.S. commitment under the TRA to provide
Taiwan with defensive weapons, but said that further arms sales is a matter that
is still under review.</P>
      <P>He, however, said that the U.S.-Taiwan military relationship should not be
judged only on weapons sales, as there are other military exchanges and training
programs between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The U.S. Defense Department notified Congress on Oct. 3, 2008 of its approval of
a US$6.46 billion arms package to Taiwan, which includes Apache attack
helicopters, Patriot PAC-3 missile batteries, Javelin anti-tank missiles and
sea-launched Harpoon missiles, as well as an upgrade of the E-2T aircraft to the
Hawkeye 2000 configuration, along with related support equipment.</P>
      <P>However,  the  approved  package  does  not  include  the diesel-electric
submarines and Black Hawk helicopters that Taiwan is seeking.  President  Ma
Ying-jeou  has  also  reiterated  his administration's desire to acquire
U.S.-built F-16 C/Ds and other weapons on many public occasions.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the U.S. could still carry out its commitments to Taiwan with a 30
-year-old TRA given the fact that both situations in the international arena and
across the Taiwan Strait have changed dramatically, Stanton said that the TRA
has served very well as the guideline for U.S. policy.</P>
      <P>That document reflects U.S. interests and reflects U.S. values. Those dont
change all that quickly. Interests and values are the bedrock of our
relationship with Taiwan,Stanton said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's jobless rate dropped to 6.04 percent in September, 0.09 percentage
points down from a record high recorded in the previous month, the Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics said Thursday.</P>
      <P>However, the seasonally adjusted rate hit a record high of 6.09 percent, up from
the 6.07 percent recorded in August, the agency said.</P>
      <P>In September, the number of unemployed people totalled 661,000, down 11,000 from
the previous month, when a record 6.13 percent was recorded, due mainly to new
graduates flooding the job market.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a survey released Thursday, some 48 percent of the
people who lost their jobs over the past year did so involuntarily, and the
unemployed were jobless for six months on average.</P>
      <P>The results of the survey conducted Oct. 8-21 by the online human resources
company 1111 Job Bank show that 21.34 percent of the unemployed were jobless for
more than a year, 12.23 percent were jobless for two or three months, and 11.03
percent took one month to find a new job.</P>
      <P>An executive in charge of public relations at 1111 Job Bank attributed the high
ratio of long-term job seekers to their lack of ability,  their  slim
competitive  edge and their  unrealistic expectations of their prospects.</P>
      <P>The number of job applications sent out by each unemployed person averaged 81,
for a total of just six interviews, according to the survey results.</P>
      <P>Since July, the number of jobs has been increasing month by month , but with the
influx of large numbers of new graduates into the job market, the unemployment
situation has not improved much, according to the executive.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,431 valid samples were collected for the survey, which had a margin
of error of 2.24 percent and a confidence level of 95 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan must improve passport procedures for visa-free US entry: envoy</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 22 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>William Stanton, director of the American Institute in Taiwan, said Thursday
that further steps need to be taken by Taiwan for it to be included in a U.S.
visa waiver program, including revising its procedure on issuing passports.</P>
      <P>The most important factor probably would be in the case of how passports are
issued here, as personal appearances are not always required to obtain a
passport and that is a central criterion that has to be met,said Stanton, the de
facto U.S. ambassador to Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>Because there have been cases where adults and children, for example, who are
not citizens of Taiwan, had been found with Taiwan passports. Our view is that
if personal appearances are required, this would be a big step forward, Stanton
added, describing the issue asthe initial largest hurdle.</P>
      <P>Stanton made the remarks in response to a reporters question at his first press
conference with local media after assuming office two months ago.</P>
      <P>According to Stanton,  other requirements, such as sharing information on stolen
passports and criminal records, need to be resolved before Taiwan can be
considered for the U.S. visa waiver program, under which citizens of member
countries may travel to the U.S. visa free for up to 90 days for business or
pleasure.</P>
      <P>The criteria for the visa waiver program are determined by U.S. law so its not a
political decision,Stanton said.</P>
      <P>In order to improve its passport security, last December Taiwan became the 60th
country in the world to begin issuingePassports, which contain a contactless
chip and antenna embedded in its back cover, with the bearer's biographical data
and facial image stored on the chip.</P>
      <P>As to local media reports that Taiwan has invited U.S. Secretary of Veteran
Affairs Eric Shinseki to visit Taiwan next year, Stanton said that he hasnt seen
such an invitation in any government channels and that there has been no
decision about a visit by anyone at this point, including General Shinseki.</P>
      <P>He, however, welcomes visits to Taiwan by U.S. Cabinet-level officials, as U.S.
policy allows such visits by Cabinet secretaries working in departments for
technical and commercial agencies.</P>
      <P>I certainly welcome visits in the future. There hasnt been one for a while so we
will see,Stanton said.</P>
      <P>If Shinseki does visit Taiwan, he will be the first incumbent Cabinet member
from the U.S. to do so in nearly a decade, and this could signal significant
strengthening of Taiwan-U.S. relations, according to some analysts.</P>
      <P>A visit in 2000 by former U.S. Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater was the
most recent by a U.S. Cabinet member.</P>

      <P>A fact-finding group of foreign envoys to Taiwan visited devastated Siaolin
township in Kaohsiung County Thursday to gain an understanding of the post-
typhoon recovery work being carried out there.</P>
      <P>The foreign envoys from Australia, Austria, Belgium, the United Kingdom, France,
Hungary, Malaysia, Switzerland and Thailand, who were there at the invitation of
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), were briefed by Kaohsiung
Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing at County Hall before heading for the township, which
was leveled by a mudslide triggered by Typhoon Morakot in early August.</P>
      <P>The damage caused by the typhoon in parts of southern Taiwan's counties of
Chiayi, Kaohsiung, and Pingtung and Taitung in eastern Taiwan was the worst in
50 years, with Siaolin township, which was totally wiped out, the hardest-hit
area.</P>
      <P>According to Yang, 575 Kaohsiung County residents were still missing and killed,
while almost all roads and bridges in the county's mountainous areas were
seriously damaged.</P>
      <P>According to estimates by experts, some 300 million square meters of silt and
rubble have been washed into rivers in the area, Yang said, adding that with
cooperation between the central and local governments and private rescue and
relief organizations, more than 6,000 refugees have been sheltered at temples
and military barracks while they await the completion of their new houses built
in safer areas.</P>

      <P>The United States is expected to approve a Taiwanese Black Hawk helicopter
procurement bid before either U.S. Thanksgiving Day in late November or
Christmas, Defense Minister Kao Hua-chu predicted Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The U.S. government is not likely to sanction any arms sales to Taiwan before
President Barack Obama's visit to China in November, but after that, there may
be a change in the U.S. attitude... and there may be good news on our Black Hawk
deal, " Kao said during a Legislative Yuan Foreign and Defense Affairs Committee
session.</P>
      <P>Noting that the U.S. Congress is screening Taiwan's chopper procurement plan,
Kao described the Ministry of National Defense (MND) as "cautiously optimistic"
about the prospects of success for the deal.</P>
      <P>On China's just-concluded National Day military parade, Kao said, the numbers
and types of weaponry systems on display were far greater than documented in
Beijing's annual defense white paper.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, he went on, Taiwan cannot afford to relax in its combat
preparedness, even though the possibility of an outbreak of war across the
Taiwan Strait "has been less in the past two years than it has been in the five
years prior to that."</P>
      <P>As part of the government's efforts to beef up its disaster response capacity in
the wake of Typhoon Morakot devastation, the MND is expected to assign 15 of the
60 Black Hawk helicopters it plans to purchase to the National Airborne Service
Corps under the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) , and Kao said maintenance of
these aircraft will be the responsibility of the MOI.</P>
      <P>On concern raised by opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Tsai
Hung-liang that President Ma Ying-jeou might turn the country's armed forces
into a "disaster relief army, " Kao said such worry is unwarranted.</P>
      <P>"The primary portion of the military's 2010 budget of NT$300.1 billion will
still go to defense and only NT$1.1 billion will be set aside for disaster
response, " Kao said, adding that while Ma has instructed the military to make
disaster response one of its core missions, it is not its only mission.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kao issued a clarification of recent speculation that Taiwan has
closed its submarine procurement office in the United States.</P>
      <P>"The speculation is groundless and the office remains in place, " he said.</P>
      <P>Chiang Lung-an, the navy's chief of staff, said the office has two staff members
responsible for the military's plan to purchase diesel-electric submarines,
with one handling submarine-related affairs and the other dealing with
administrative matters.</P>
      <P>"The MND also has a special panel tasked with maintaining contact with the
submarine procurement office in the United States, " Chiang added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has long been seeking to buy diesel-electric submarines, but the plan has
never borne fruit because of complex technical and political issues.</P>

      <P>With a government inoculation program slated to kick off Nov. 1 to contain the
spread of influenza A(H1N1), the first batch of the vaccine manufactured by the
Swiss-based pharmaceutical firm Novartis arrived in Taiwan Thursday.</P>
      <P>The first 370,000 doses of vaccine, part of the 5 million doses that Taiwan has
purchased from Novartis, will be distributed over the next few days to appointed
spots around the country where the public will be able to get shots, said
officials of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the Cabinet-level
Department of Health (DOH).</P>
      <P>The 5 million doses of vaccine will help meet local demand for about 12 million
doses.</P>
      <P>The DOH will use the Novartis vaccine in the initial stages of the inoculation
program, as locally produced vaccine will not be available until mid-November.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, DOH Minister Yaung Chih-liang hailed the mid-term results of
human clinical testing of H1N1 vaccine produced by Adimmune Corp., Taiwan's sole
human vaccine manufacturer, saying that the Adimmune vaccine is in no way
inferior to H1N1 vaccine marketed by foreign firms.</P>
      <P>According to Kang Chao-chou, chief of the DOH's Bureau of Pharmaceutical

      <P>Taiwan's birth rate has continued its downward trend, with the number of
newborns expected to drop to a new low this year, an official of the Ministry of
the Interior (MOI) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Only 137,967 babies were born in Taiwan in the first nine months of this year,
representing  a 3.4 percent decline  from the year-earlier level, the official
said.</P>
      <P>"Given this trend, the total number of this year's newborns could fall below
192,000, which would be a new low in the country's history, " the official
added.</P>
      <P>The number of newborns slid below the benchmark 200,000 for the first time in
2008, when only 198,733 babies were born.</P>
      <P>According to MOI tallies, northern Taiwan's Hsinchu City boasted the highest
crude birth rate of 9.4 births per 1,000 population for the January-September
period, while the northern port city of Keelung recorded the lowest birth rate
of 4.9.</P>
      <P>Compared with the same period of last year, the offshore Kinmen and Lienchiang
counties saw the largest growth in birth rate, both increasing 0.5 per 1,000
population, while the southern city of Chiayi posted the largest decline of 0.5
per 1,000.</P>
      <P>In terms of maternal nationality, 91.2 percent of the newborns were delivered by
Taiwanese nationals, 4.7 percent were born to women from China, Hong Kong and
Macau and 4.1 percent were born to people from other countries.</P>
      <P>Over the past six years, the MOI official said, the annual number of births to
women from the three Chinese areas has remained almost the same, but the number
of newborns delivered by spouses from elsewhere has been declining steadily.</P>
      <P>In terms of marital status, 132,450 newborns, or 96 percent of the total, were
born to married couples, while 5,489 or 3.98 percent were born out of wedlock,
and 28, or 0.02 percent, were deserted babies or orphans.</P>
      <P>Taitung County in eastern Taiwan had the highest number of illegitimate babies,
followed by neighboring Hualien County and then Keelung City.</P>
      <P>The number of babies born out of wedlock marked a 0.22 percent decrease from the
2008 level, but an increase of 1.06 percent from 1997, according to MOI tallies.</P>

      <P>The government will not consider legalizing gun ownership by the country's
citizens, Minister of the Interior Jiang Yi-huah said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Jiang said the disadvantages of allowing gun ownership outweigh the benefits and
that the ministry will only consider allowing security guards to carry firearms.</P>
      <P>He was responding to a call by opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Legislator Yu Tien to allow law-abiding citizens to own handguns to protect
themselves.</P>
      <P>Yu claimed that gun smuggling is "quite common" in Taiwan, which he said not
only enables gangsters and the wealthy to buy guns easily but also boosts the
price of illegal firearms on the black market.</P>
      <P>Possession of firearms by the general public would be a great deterrent for mob
activity, he said.</P>
      <P>In response, National Police Agency (NPA) Director-General Wang Cho-chiun
pointed out that social order in Taiwan is not so bad that people need guns to
protect themselves.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ye Yu-lan, an associate professor at Central Police University,
expressed opposition to allowing legal ownership of firearms by citizens,
including security guards.</P>
      <P>Although there is still controversy  over whether Taiwan's citizens should be
allowed to bear arms for self defense, there are nonetheless more than 5,000
legally privately owned handguns in the country, according to statistics
released that day by the NPA.</P>
      <P>Of the total privately owned guns, 1,000 are for self-defense and 4,000 are used
by aboriginal people for hunting, according to the agency.</P>
      <P>The number of privately owned guns has been decreasing year on year because of
strict domestic regulations on private ownership of firearms, an agency official
added.</P>
      <P>The Statute for Management  of Self-Defense  Firearms  was originally enacted as
many people brought guns with them when they retreated to Taiwan along with the
Kuomintang government in 1949 after losing the Chinese civil war to the
Communist Party of China.</P>
      <P>Under the statute, people who own private arms are required to receive a regular
inspection every two years as well as random inspections by the police.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will soon lift a ban on U.S. bone-in beef from cattle younger than 30
months, Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"We will formally announce new market-opening measures before the end of this
month or on Friday at the earliest, " Yaung said as bilateral negotiations on
the long-running issue were entering their final stages.</P>
      <P>U.S. bone-in beef to be allowed into Taiwan in the initial phase will include
T-bone and rib steak, while beef offal will remain on the off-limits list, Yaung
said.</P>
      <P>"As for ground beef, the two sides are still in talks on this issue," the
minister added.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years, the United States has continued pushing Taiwan to
open its market wider to U.S. beef and after many rounds of risk assessments and
intensive bilateral negotiations, Taiwan has finally decided to gradually ease
import restrictions on U.S. beef, Yaung explained.</P>
      <P>For health considerations, Yaung went on, beef offal will remain off the import
list in the initial stage.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he went on, local importers will be required to produce Quality System
Assessment (QSA) certificates issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>According to the DOH's Bureau of Food Safety, the QSA program provides suppliers
of agricultural  products and services the opportunity  to assure customers  of
their ability to provide consistent quality products or services.</P>
      <P>"This assurance is based on meeting product requirements through a documented
quality management system, " said Hsu Ching-hsin, a DOH food safety expert, who
added that a QSA program will allow beef from U.S. cattle to be eligible to
enter Taiwan and will certify through documentation, verification and
traceability that the meat is from cattle less than 30 months of age.</P>
      <P>Taiwan banned U.S. beef in 2003 when a case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE) -- also called mad cow disease -- was diagnosed in Seattle. The ban was
lifted in April 2005 to allow imports of U.S. de-boned beef from cattle under 30
months, but the government reimposed the ban two months later when a second BSE
case was discovered in the U.S.</P>
      <P>In 2006, the DOH agreed to allow beef imports once again, but only boneless beef
from cattle younger than 30 months, produced by certified slaughterhouses and
without any risky parts such as brains, skulls, eyes, spinal nerve roots,
tonsils and small intestines.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years, U.S. beef imports have been increasing steadily. In
2008, imports of U.S. beef amounted to a record US$136 million, despite the ban
on bone-in beef.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan must improve passport procedures for visa-free US entry: envoy</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 22 (CNA)
10/22/09  19:54:34
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>William Stanton, director of the American Institute in Taiwan, said Thursday
that further steps need to be taken by Taiwan for it to be included in a U.S.
visa waiver program, including revising its procedure on issuing passports.</P>
      <P>The most important factor probably would be in the case of how passports are
issued here, as personal appearances are not always required to obtain a
passport and that is a central criterion that has to be met,said Stanton, the de
facto U.S. ambassador to Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>Because there have been cases where adults and children, for example, who are
not citizens of Taiwan, had been found with Taiwan passports. Our view is that
if personal appearances are required, this would be a big step forward, Stanton
added, describing the issue asthe initial largest hurdle.</P>
      <P>Stanton made the remarks in response to a reporters question at his first press
conference with local media after assuming office two months ago.</P>
      <P>According to Stanton,  other requirements, such as sharing information on stolen
passports and criminal records, need to be resolved before Taiwan can be
considered for the U.S. visa waiver program, under which citizens of member
countries may travel to the U.S. visa free for up to 90 days for business or
pleasure.</P>
      <P>The criteria for the visa waiver program are determined by U.S. law so its not a
political decision,Stanton said.</P>
      <P>In order to improve its passport security, last December Taiwan became the 60th
country in the world to begin issuingePassports, which contain a contactless
chip and antenna embedded in its back cover, with the bearer's biographical data
and facial image stored on the chip.</P>
      <P>As to local media reports that Taiwan has invited U.S. Secretary of Veteran
Affairs Eric Shinseki to visit Taiwan next year, Stanton said that he hasnt seen
such an invitation in any government channels and that there has been no
decision about a visit by anyone at this point, including General Shinseki.</P>
      <P>He, however, welcomes visits to Taiwan by U.S. Cabinet-level officials, as U.S.
policy allows such visits by Cabinet secretaries working in departments for
technical and commercial agencies.</P>
      <P>I certainly welcome visits in the future. There hasnt been one for a while so we
will see,Stanton said.</P>
      <P>If Shinseki does visit Taiwan, he will be the first incumbent Cabinet member
from the U.S. to do so in nearly a decade, and this could signal significant
strengthening of Taiwan-U.S. relations, according to some analysts.</P>
      <P>A visit in 2000 by former U.S. Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater was the
most recent by a U.S. Cabinet member.</P>

      <P>A fact-finding group of foreign envoys to Taiwan visited devastated Siaolin
township in Kaohsiung County Thursday to gain an understanding of the post-
typhoon recovery work being carried out there.</P>
      <P>The foreign envoys from Australia, Austria, Belgium, the United Kingdom, France,
Hungary, Malaysia, Switzerland and Thailand, who were there at the invitation of
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), were briefed by Kaohsiung
Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing at County Hall before heading for the township, which
was leveled by a mudslide triggered by Typhoon Morakot in early August.</P>
      <P>The damage caused by the typhoon in parts of southern Taiwan's counties of
Chiayi, Kaohsiung, and Pingtung and Taitung in eastern Taiwan was the worst in
50 years, with Siaolin township, which was totally wiped out, the hardest-hit
area.</P>
      <P>According to Yang, 575 Kaohsiung County residents were still missing and killed,
while almost all roads and bridges in the county's mountainous areas were
seriously damaged.</P>
      <P>According to estimates by experts, some 300 million square meters of silt and
rubble have been washed into rivers in the area, Yang said, adding that with
cooperation between the central and local governments and private rescue and
relief organizations, more than 6,000 refugees have been sheltered at temples
and military barracks while they await the completion of their new houses built
in safer areas.</P>
      <P>At present, 132 prefabricated houses have been constructed to house some of
them, while other permanent residences will be completed within six months, Yang
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States is expected to approve a Taiwanese Black Hawk helicopter
procurement bid before either U.S. Thanksgiving Day in late November or
Christmas, Defense Minister Kao Hua-chu predicted Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The U.S. government is not likely to sanction any arms sales to Taiwan before
President Barack Obama's visit to China in November, but after that, there may
be a change in the U.S. attitude... and there may be good news on our Black Hawk
deal, " Kao said during a Legislative Yuan Foreign and Defense Affairs Committee
session.</P>
      <P>Noting that the U.S. Congress is screening Taiwan's chopper procurement plan,
Kao described the Ministry of National Defense (MND) as "cautiously optimistic"
about the prospects of success for the deal.</P>
      <P>On China's just-concluded National Day military parade, Kao said, the numbers
and types of weaponry systems on display were far greater than documented in
Beijing's annual defense white paper.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, he went on, Taiwan cannot afford to relax in its combat
preparedness, even though the possibility of an outbreak of war across the
Taiwan Strait "has been less in the past two years than it has been in the five
years prior to that."</P>
      <P>As part of the government's efforts to beef up its disaster response capacity in
the wake of Typhoon Morakot devastation, the MND is expected to assign 15 of the
60 Black Hawk helicopters it plans to purchase to the National Airborne Service
Corps under the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) , and Kao said maintenance of
these aircraft will be the responsibility of the MOI.</P>
      <P>On concern raised by opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Tsai
Hung-liang that President Ma Ying-jeou might turn the country's armed forces
into a "disaster relief army, " Kao said such worry is unwarranted.</P>
      <P>"The primary portion of the military's 2010 budget of NT$300.1 billion will
still go to defense and only NT$1.1 billion will be set aside for disaster
response, " Kao said, adding that while Ma has instructed the military to make
disaster response one of its core missions, it is not its only mission.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kao issued a clarification of recent speculation that Taiwan has
closed its submarine procurement office in the United States.</P>
      <P>"The speculation is groundless and the office remains in place, " he said.</P>
      <P>Chiang Lung-an, the navy's chief of staff, said the office has two staff members
responsible for the military's plan to purchase diesel-electric submarines,
with one handling submarine-related affairs and the other dealing with
administrative matters.</P>
      <P>"The MND also has a special panel tasked with maintaining contact with the
submarine procurement office in the United States, " Chiang added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has long been seeking to buy diesel-electric submarines, but the plan has
never borne fruit because of complex technical and political issues.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With a government inoculation program slated to kick off Nov. 1 to contain the
spread of influenza A(H1N1), the first batch of the vaccine manufactured by the
Swiss-based pharmaceutical firm Novartis arrived in Taiwan Thursday.</P>
      <P>The first 370,000 doses of vaccine, part of the 5 million doses that Taiwan has
purchased from Novartis, will be distributed over the next few days to appointed
spots around the country where the public will be able to get shots, said
officials of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the Cabinet-level
Department of Health (DOH).</P>
      <P>The 5 million doses of vaccine will help meet local demand for about 12 million
doses.</P>
      <P>The DOH will use the Novartis vaccine in the initial stages of the inoculation
program, as locally produced vaccine will not be available until mid-November.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, DOH Minister Yaung Chih-liang hailed the mid-term results of
human clinical testing of H1N1 vaccine produced by Adimmune Corp., Taiwan's sole
human vaccine manufacturer, saying that the Adimmune vaccine is in no way
inferior to H1N1 vaccine marketed by foreign firms.</P>
      <P>According to Kang Chao-chou, chief of the DOH's Bureau of Pharmaceutical
Affairs, the relevant data on the mid-term results will be published only after
being confirmed by a screening committee and conclusions will be submitted to
the CDC.</P>
      <P>A complete evaluation report on the efficacy and safety of the Adimmune vaccine
is expected to be available in mid-November, Kang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the number of deaths from influenza A(HIN1) had hit 26 in Taiwan as
of Wednesday, with a 39-year-old woman from Taipei County listed as the latest
victim.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's birth rate has continued its downward trend, with the number of
newborns expected to drop to a new low this year, an official of the Ministry of
the Interior (MOI) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Only 137,967 babies were born in Taiwan in the first nine months of this year,
representing  a 3.4 percent decline  from the year-earlier level, the official
said.</P>
      <P>"Given this trend, the total number of this year's newborns could fall below
192,000, which would be a new low in the country's history, " the official
added.</P>
      <P>The number of newborns slid below the benchmark 200,000 for the first time in
2008, when only 198,733 babies were born.</P>
      <P>According to MOI tallies, northern Taiwan's Hsinchu City boasted the highest
crude birth rate of 9.4 births per 1,000 population for the January-September
period, while the northern port city of Keelung recorded the lowest birth rate
of 4.9.</P>
      <P>Compared with the same period of last year, the offshore Kinmen and Lienchiang
counties saw the largest growth in birth rate, both increasing 0.5 per 1,000
population, while the southern city of Chiayi posted the largest decline of 0.5
per 1,000.</P>
      <P>In terms of maternal nationality, 91.2 percent of the newborns were delivered by
Taiwanese nationals, 4.7 percent were born to women from China, Hong Kong and
Macau and 4.1 percent were born to people from other countries.</P>
      <P>Over the past six years, the MOI official said, the annual number of births to
women from the three Chinese areas has remained almost the same, but the number
of newborns delivered by spouses from elsewhere has been declining steadily.</P>
      <P>In terms of marital status, 132,450 newborns, or 96 percent of the total, were
born to married couples, while 5,489 or 3.98 percent were born out of wedlock,
and 28, or 0.02 percent, were deserted babies or orphans.</P>
      <P>Taitung County in eastern Taiwan had the highest number of illegitimate babies,
followed by neighboring Hualien County and then Keelung City.</P>
      <P>The number of babies born out of wedlock marked a 0.22 percent decrease from the
2008 level, but an increase of 1.06 percent from 1997, according to MOI tallies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Legalization of gun ownership not considered: interior minister</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 22 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will not consider legalizing gun ownership by the country's
citizens, Minister of the Interior Jiang Yi-huah said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Jiang said the disadvantages of allowing gun ownership outweigh the benefits and
that the ministry will only consider allowing security guards to carry firearms.</P>
      <P>He was responding to a call by opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Legislator Yu Tien to allow law-abiding citizens to own handguns to protect
themselves.</P>
      <P>Yu claimed that gun smuggling is "quite common" in Taiwan, which he said not
only enables gangsters and the wealthy to buy guns easily but also boosts the
price of illegal firearms on the black market.</P>
      <P>Possession of firearms by the general public would be a great deterrent for mob
activity, he said.</P>
      <P>In response, National Police Agency (NPA) Director-General Wang Cho-chiun
pointed out that social order in Taiwan is not so bad that people need guns to
protect themselves.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ye Yu-lan, an associate professor at Central Police University,
expressed opposition to allowing legal ownership of firearms by citizens,
including security guards.</P>
      <P>Although there is still controversy  over whether Taiwan's citizens should be
allowed to bear arms for self defense, there are nonetheless more than 5,000
legally privately owned handguns in the country, according to statistics
released that day by the NPA.</P>
      <P>Of the total privately owned guns, 1,000 are for self-defense and 4,000 are used
by aboriginal people for hunting, according to the agency.</P>
      <P>The number of privately owned guns has been decreasing year on year because of
strict domestic regulations on private ownership of firearms, an agency official
added.</P>
      <P>The Statute for Management  of Self-Defense  Firearms  was originally enacted as
many people brought guns with them when they retreated to Taiwan along with the
Kuomintang government in 1949 after losing the Chinese civil war to the
Communist Party of China.</P>
      <P>Under the statute, people who own private arms are required to receive a regular
inspection every two years as well as random inspections by the police.</P>

      <P>Wage earners experienced a record decline in their real incomes during the first
eight months of 2009, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and

      <P>The average monthly income of local employees between January and August fell by
a record 6.79 percent year-on-year to NT$43,339, lower than the NT$43,388 posted
in 2000, said Liu Tien-si, a DGBAS deputy department chief.</P>
      <P>The average regular monthly wage also contracted during the same period by a

      <P>The average wage includes regular wages (salary and fixed monthly subsidies and

      <P>Taiwan will soon lift a ban on U.S. bone-in beef from cattle younger than 30
months, Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"We will formally announce new market-opening measures before the end of this
month or on Friday at the earliest, " Yaung said as bilateral negotiations on
the long-running issue were entering their final stages.</P>
      <P>U.S. bone-in beef to be allowed into Taiwan in the initial phase will include
T-bone and rib steak, while beef offal will remain on the off-limits list, Yaung
said.</P>
      <P>"As for ground beef, the two sides are still in talks on this issue," the
minister added.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years, the United States has continued pushing Taiwan to
open its market wider to U.S. beef and after many rounds of risk assessments and
intensive bilateral negotiations, Taiwan has finally decided to gradually ease
import restrictions on U.S. beef, Yaung explained.</P>
      <P>For health considerations, Yaung went on, beef offal will remain off the import
list in the initial stage.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he went on, local importers will be required to produce Quality System
Assessment (QSA) certificates issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>According to the DOH's Bureau of Food Safety, the QSA program provides suppliers
of agricultural  products and services the opportunity  to assure customers  of
their ability to provide consistent quality products or services.</P>
      <P>"This assurance is based on meeting product requirements through a documented
quality management system, " said Hsu Ching-hsin, a DOH food safety expert, who
added that a QSA program will allow beef from U.S. cattle to be eligible to
enter Taiwan and will certify through documentation, verification and
traceability that the meat is from cattle less than 30 months of age.</P>
      <P>Taiwan banned U.S. beef in 2003 when a case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE) -- also called mad cow disease -- was diagnosed in Seattle. The ban was
lifted in April 2005 to allow imports of U.S. de-boned beef from cattle under 30
months, but the government reimposed the ban two months later when a second BSE
case was discovered in the U.S.</P>
      <P>In 2006, the DOH agreed to allow beef imports once again, but only boneless beef
from cattle younger than 30 months, produced by certified slaughterhouses and
without any risky parts such as brains, skulls, eyes, spinal nerve roots,
tonsils and small intestines.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years, U.S. beef imports have been increasing steadily. In
2008, imports of U.S. beef amounted to a record US$136 million, despite the ban
on bone-in beef.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan agrees to lift ban on U.S. bone-in beef from young cattle</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan agreed to lift a ban on U.S. bone-in beef from cattle younger than 30
months Thursday by inking a protocol on Taiwan's new market-opening measures in
Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>According to the protocol, the U.S. bone-in beef to be allowed into Taiwan in
the initial phase will include T-bone and rib steak.</P>
      <P>U.S. beef offal will remain on the off-limits list, while further talks will
still be needed on imports of ground beef, according to the protocol.</P>
      <P>Senior Media Affairs Liaison Nefeterius Akeli McPherson of the Office of the
U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) expressed welcome to Taiwan's decision to
further open its market to U.S. beef based on scientific evidence and policies
that are in line with World Organization of Animal Health (OIE) standards.</P>
      <P>McPherson said U.S. beef exporters will follow a quality system assessment (QSA)
program of the Department of Agriculture to ensure that U.S. beef entering
Taiwan is from cattle less than 30 months of age and is certified through
documentation,  verification  and traceability.</P>
      <P>The OIE listed both the United States and Taiwan in 2007 as countries in which
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, are well under
control.</P>
      <P>It has continued to list cattle parts such as brains, skulls, eyes,  spinal
nerve roots,  tonsils and small intestines,  as "particularly risky" and these
items remain on lists of export or import bans.</P>
      <P>USTR officials said the United States will continue cooperating with Taiwan on
pushing exports of beef and related products that are carried in the protocol.</P>
      <P>The opening measures were expected to be announced by the Department of Health
(DOH) in Taipei later.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years, the United States has continued pushing Taiwan to
open its market wider to U.S. beef and after many rounds of risk assessments and
intensive bilateral negotiations, Taiwan finally decided to gradually ease
import restrictions.</P>
      <P>Taiwan banned U.S. beef in 2003 when a case of mad cow disease was diagnosed in
Seattle. The ban was lifted in April 2005 to allow imports of U.S. de-boned beef
from cattle under 30 months, but the government reimposed the ban two months
later when a second BSE case was discovered in the U.S.</P>
      <P>In 2006, the DOH agreed to allow beef imports once again, but only boneless beef
from cattle younger than 30 months, produced by certified slaughterhouses and
without any risky parts.</P>
      <P>Since then, U.S. beef imports have been increasing steadily. In 2008, imports of
U.S. beef amounted to a record US$136 million, despite the ban on bone-in beef.</P>

      <P>U.S.-Taiwan Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) talks are expected
to be resumed by the end of this year now that the issue of beef imports from
the U.S. has been resolved, Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's decision to further open its market to U.S. beef has paved the way for
a resumption of the annual TIFA talks, which have been stalled since 2007, Shih
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan agreed to lift a ban on U.S. bone-in beef from cattle younger than 30
months and inked a protocol on Taiwan's new market-opening measures in
Washington, D.C. on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Shih said he recently reported to Vice Premier Eric Lilun Chu about the
importance of renewing the TIFA talks and said that under the TIFA dialogue
framework this time, Taiwan will seek to talk about e-commerce, product
verification and other related issues.</P>
      <P>Shih's remarks echoed those made by William Stanton, the top U.S. envoy to
Taiwan, who said the previous day that the United States and Taiwan have agreed
to seek a gradual approach to resolving the long-running issue of Taiwan's
restrictions on U.S. beef imports.</P>
      <P>Stanton said that as soon as the "hurdle of the beef" was cleared, the TIFA
talks aimed at strengthening bilateral economic and trade relations between
Taiwan and the U.S. could be resumed soon, hopefully before the end of this
year.</P>
      <P>The U.S. side, meanwhile, is expected to bring forward issues including
pharmaceuticals, pricing of medical devices and ractopamine testing of
U.S.-exported pork in the next round of TIFA talks, according to an official
from the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the U.S. signed the TIFA in 1994 as a stepping stone to a Taiwan-U.S.
free trade agreement. Under this framework, meetings were held once or twice a
year since then until July 2007.</P>
      <P>Senior Media Affairs Liaison Nefeterius Akeli McPherson of the Office of the
U.S. Trade Representative expressed welcome that day to Taiwan's decision to
lift its ban on U.S. bone-in beef from young cattle.</P>
      <P>The latest development is conducive to a resumption of the TIFA talks, according
to McPherson.</P>
      <P>"We look forward to seeing both sides getting the opportunity to communicate,
since there are so many trade issues to be settled, " she said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a Washington, D.C.-based Taiwanese official cast doubt on whether the
new round of TIFA talks will take place this year, given that the U.S.
government is running a tight schedule for the rest of this year, including an
annual meeting of the China-U.S. Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT) ,
a visit to China by President Barack Obama and the leadership summit of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.</P>

      <P>Sergey Gubarev, Russia's top envoy to Taiwan, was conferred a diplomatic medal
Friday in recognition of his contributions to promoting relations between Taiwan
and Russia.</P>
      <P>Gubarev, the representative of the Moscow-Taipei Coordination Commission on
Economic and Cultural Cooperation in Taipei, is scheduled to leave Taiwan Nov. 7
after serving four years as the de facto Russian ambassador  to Taiwan in the
absence of formal diplomatic relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>"During his four-year tenure, Representative Gubarev has done an excellent job
of expanding Russia-Taiwan exchanges in such areas as the economy and trade,
technology, arts and culture, " said Foreign Minister Timothy C.T. Yang at the
ceremony to confer Gubarev the Friendship Medal of Diplomacy.</P>
      <P>"His dedication to this task has won him many friends from all walks of society
in Taiwan, and especially from the ministry."</P>
      <P>Describing Gubarev as an outstanding diplomat with a wealth of experience, Yang
said he promoted various projects beneficial to bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>They included arranging a visit to Taiwan last year by a delegation led by
Anatoly Chubais, Russia's former first prime minister and CEO of the state-run
nanotechnology company Rusnano, and a trip to Russia by Taiwan's vice minister
of economic affairs to attend the first International Forum on Nanotechnologies,
also last year.</P>
      <P>The top Russian envoy to Taiwan said that during his tenure in Taiwan, he did
his best to deepen the understanding between people in Taiwan and Russia.</P>
      <P>"The best side of (my) Taiwanese life was the Taiwanese people, who are very
friendly, cooperative, and open," according to Gubarev.</P>
      <P>He said he found the diplomatic medal precious because he received it from
people he loves.</P>
      <P>"Thanks to the attitude of the Taiwanese people, the four years that I spent
here in Taiwan (were) like one day for me," he said.</P>
      <P>As to promoting direct flights between Taipei and Moscow, Gubarev said it's an
ongoing effort by the two sides, but the main obstacles lie in the airlines
rather than the governments.</P>

representative to Taiwan, is scheduled to arrive Nov. 16.</P>

      <P>In 2006, the DOH agreed to allow beef imports once again, but they were
restricted to boneless beef from cattle younger than 30 months, produced by
certified slaughterhouses and without any risky parts.</P>
      <P>Since then, U.S. beef imports have steadily increased and totaled a record
US$136 million in 2008, despite the ban on bone-in beef.</P>

      <P>The American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei (AmCham) on Friday called on Taipei
and Washington to resume the long-stalled Trade and Investment Framework
Agreement (TIFA) talks now that the controversial issue of Taiwan's restrictions
on U.S. beef imports has been resolved.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued Friday, AmCham welcomed the announcement that Taiwan and
the United States have reached agreement on a protocol on the liberalization of
imports of U.S. beef products into the Taiwan market.</P>
      <P>"The protocol removes what had been a major irritant in the bilateral economic
relationship. AmCham now urges the two governments to quickly schedule the long-
delayed next round of TIFA talks, which should take place in Taipei," the AmCham
said.</P>
      <P>"TIFA talks have proven in the past to be a highly useful vehicle for the two
sides to discuss trade and investment-related issues in detail, moving bilateral
economic relations forward to the benefit of both economies," the statement
added.</P>
      <P>Shih Yen-shiang, Taiwan's minister of economic affairs, expressed confidence
Thursday that Washington and Taipei will resume TIFA talks -- stalled since 2007
-- by the end of this year now that the beef issue has been resolved.</P>
      <P>Taiwan agreed to lift a ban on U.S. bone-in beef from cattle younger than 30
months and inked a protocol on Taiwan's new market-opening measure in Washington
D.C. on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Shih's remarks echoed those made by William Stanton, the top U.S. envoy to
Taiwan, who said Thursday that as soon as the "hurdle of the beef" was cleared,
the TIFA talks, aimed at strengthening bilateral economic and trade relations
between Taiwan and the U.S., could be resumed soon, hopefully before the end of
this year.</P>

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials on
Friday:</P>
      <P>Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>No gag order</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan was criticized after a panel of experts commissioned by it to
revamp the country's tax system recommended imposing energy taxes.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the incident, President Ma Ying-jeou said in an interview with
the Apple Daily that scholars commissioned by the government to offer advice on
policy should be morally obliged to keep their suggestions confidential before
the government has had a chance to consider them.</P>
      <P>The president is wrong. What really matters is how the government makes its
decisions,  not stopping scholars from airing their opinions.</P>
      <P>Actually, the public should be prepared for any new policy through a public
debate, and only a public debate can convince the people to support the
government's policy.</P>
      <P>By gagging the scholars, the government will lose a valuable way to educate
public opinion.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Dismissing two vote-buyers is not enough</P>
      <P>Although Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou has dismissed two Central Standing
Committee members-elect because of vote-buying, it is not enough to wipe out the
practice altogether.</P>
      <P>The Central Standing Committee is no long the policy-making body of the
Kuomintang, and its members have no real political power.</P>
      <P>But there are still many people vying for membership on the commission and even
offering gifts to solicit votes, which is a kind of vote-buying.</P>
      <P>If this corrupt practice is to be wiped out, it is not enough to dismiss only
two members-elect. We urge Ma to get rid of all corrupt members-elect on the KMT
Central Standing Committee to show the public that he is determined to clear the
political arena of people who rig elections.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>People should choose carefully in upcoming elections to avoid</P>
      <P>being sold out</P>
      <P>By assuming leadership of the ruling Kuomintang, Ma Ying-jeou has achieved what
he called "complete governance" -- control of both the government and the ruling
party.</P>
      <P>He has tightened his control of the KMT by laying down rules that prevent party
lawmakers from criticizing his administration.</P>
      <P>Having muzzled his party's lawmakers, Ma will not only have absolute power but
will also be completely unaccountable for whatever he does.</P>
      <P>With Ma's growing power, the people's misery will also grow. How did the people
end up in such a plight? It is because they were tricked by Ma into electing him
as president and his party as the majority in the legislature.</P>
      <P>In order to stop Ma from selling them out, the people should carefully choose
who to vote for in the year-end elections.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Why should children's potential be inspired by outside stimulus?</P>
      <P>A local mental toughness-enhancing camp has been thrust into limelight in recent
days for its practice of toughening children up by forcing them to eat fire.</P>
      <P>The children were also reported to have been urged to walk on broken glass. What
are these training programs for? To train the students to be acrobats or
stuntmen?</P>
      <P>Why do the parents of these children sign them up for such camps? The answer is
because they are afraid that their children will be left behind on the starting
line.</P>
      <P>So it is the parents' desire to make their children more competitive against
their peers that is to be blamed for their foolishness in putting their kids
through such ridiculous training programs.</P>
      <P>Parents should know that each child is unique and should not be compared with
others, and that the most valuable gift they can give to their children is
unconditional love that will inspire their children to fulfill their potential.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Consumers' Foundation blasts decision on U.S. bone-in beef</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Consumers' Foundation condemned the government Friday for succumbing to
"the United States' political and economic bullying" by agreeing Thursday to
lift a ban on U.S. bone-in beef.</P>
      <P>Describing the decision as a "wrong policy" made at the cost of the health of
Taiwanese consumers, foundation Chairman Hsieh Tien-jen said his group will not
recognize or accept it.</P>
      <P>Taiwan agreed to lift a ban on U.S. bone-in beef from cattle younger than 30
months and inked a protocol on Taiwan's new liberalized approach in Washington,
D.C. on Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the protocol, the U.S. bone-in beef to be allowed into Taiwan in
the initial phase will include T-bone and rib steak.</P>
      <P>Beef considered to be contaminated by "specific risk materials" or from cattle
over 30 months of age will remain on the banned list, while further talks will
still be needed on ground beef imports, according to the protocol.</P>
      <P>Expressing extreme regret over the government's decision, Hsieh said the
foundation had tried to dissuade the government over the past five years from
beginning talks with the U.S. on further opening the country's doors to U.S.
beef before complementary measures were put in place.</P>
      <P>The foundation has often advocated measures such as "batch by batch offshore
inspection, " "meat tracking records, " and "warnings on labels" before Taiwan
engaged in talks on the issue with Washington, Hsieh stressed.</P>
      <P>He said no serious beef inspection system exists in the United States, and even
China has barred the import of U.S. beef and beef products for fear of infection
of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>"On the other hand,  Taiwan,  which calls itself a human rights-upholding
nation, has opened its doors so easily to U.S. beef," he lamented.</P>
      <P>Consumers' Foundation Secretary-General Gaston Wu suspected that the decision
was made rashly by people "upstairs, " as he discovered that relevant government
agencies, such as the Department of Health, were not aware of what was
happening.</P>
      <P>Wu attributed the decision to the fact that Taiwan needs to beg to exist in the
international community, thus creating opportunities for global political or
economic bullies to exploit the country.</P>
      <P>"Do innocent Taiwanese consumers need to swallow all of this simply because of
the global political and economic bullying? " he questioned.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Executive Yuan spokesman Su Jun-pin said Friday that the government
respects the decision and judgment made by the DOH on the opening.</P>
      <P>According to the DOH, the signing of the protocol inked in Washington, D.C.,
Thursday means that local importers can apply for import permits for their first
shipments of U.S. T-bone steak in mid-November at the earliest.</P>
      <P>In related news, Kuomintang Legislator Lu Hsueh-chang expressed his hope Friday
that U.S. bone-in beef will be allowed to enter Taiwan's market only after
details of the opening agreement are made known to the public and after
consumers' doubts on the meat and related products are dissipated.</P>
      <P>Legislator  Huang  Sue-ying  of the  opposition  Democratic Progressive Party
criticized the move, arguing that Taiwan's existing restrictions on U.S. beef
were not severe and in fact more lenient than those adopted in China, Australia,
Japan and Singapore.</P>
      <P>Huang said she suspected that the DOH had something to hide from consumers,
without elaborating.</P>
      <P>The United States has prodded Taiwan to open its market wider to U.S. beef over
the past three years.</P>
      <P>Taiwan first banned U.S. beef in 2003 when a case of mad cow disease surfaced in
Seattle. The ban was lifted in April 2005 to allow imports of U.S. de-boned beef
from cattle under 30 months, but the government reimposed the ban two months
later when a second BSE case was discovered in the U.S.</P>
      <P>In 2006, the DOH agreed to allow beef imports once again, but limited them to
boneless beef from cattle younger than 30 months produced by certified
slaughterhouses and without any risky parts.</P>
      <P>Since then, U.S. beef imports have steadily increasing, amounting to a record
high US$136 million in 2008, despite the ban on bone-in beef.</P>

      <P>Amid some negative responses to Taiwan's imminent opening to U.S. bone-in beef,
Executive Yuan spokesman Su Jun-pin said Friday that the government respects the
Department of Health's (DOH's) professional judgment on the matter.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks after Taiwan and the United States clinched a deal Thursday
in Washington D. C. to lift a partial ban on U.S. beef imports.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan only allows imports of U.S. boneless beef that contain no
specified risk materials (SRMs) and from cattle younger than 30 months.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the new accord, U.S. bone-in beef, ground beef, intestines
and processed beef that have not been contaminated with SRMs will also be
allowed to enter Taiwan with effect from Nov. 10.</P>
      <P>DOH Vice Minister Hsiao Mei-ling, and Hsu Tien-lai, chief of the Bureau of
Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine under the Council of
Agriculture, said at a news conference Friday that the scope of Taiwan's opening
to U.S. beef imports is on par with South Korea's.</P>
      <P>Thirty other countries allow the importation of U.S. beef from cattle older than
30 months, Hsiao noted.</P>
      <P>Only beef without SRMs, which include skulls, backbones, brain matter, and
certain intestine parts and organs, will be allowed into Taiwan, he stressed.</P>
      <P>To ensure the safety of U.S. bone-in beef, the DOH has twice sent experts to the
United States, where they made on-the-spot risk assessment of the quality of the
product, Hsu noted.</P>
      <P>Hsu said he "believes" that U.S. beef is free from health risks, and its
importation is not likely to cause contagious diseases in Taiwan's livestock
industry or squeeze local producers.</P>
      <P>"The move is not expected to impact on the local beef industry, given that the
market for local and foreign beef is well segmented in Taiwan," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan produces some 6,000 metric tons of beef every year, far less than the
imported amount of around 73,000 metric tons per year, he noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DOH officials said that a Taiwanese importer may submit an
application to import T-bone steaks from the United States as early as mid-
November.</P>
      <P>Taiwan first banned U.S. beef in 2003 after a case of mad cow disease was
confirmed in the United States. The ban was lifted in April 2005 to allow
imports of U.S. de-boned beef from cattle under 30 months, but the government
reimposed the ban two months later when a second mad cow case was detected in
the United States.</P>
      <P>In January 2006, Taiwan partially lifted the ban to allow U.S. boneless beef
from cattle younger than 30 months.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Scholar proposes "one China, two constitutions" formula</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A scholar on Friday proposed a "one China, two constitutions" formula for
settling political disputes between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"A peace agreement between Taiwan and China can be possible if both sides agree
to adopt this formula," said Professor Huang Kuang-kuo of National Taiwan
University, at a Taipei seminar on a possible cross-strait peace agreement.</P>
      <P>Under the formula, the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China
would each have their own constitution and exercise jurisdiction over their own
territory, while upholding the one-China principle.</P>
      <P>The territories would be recognized as the Chinese mainland for China, and
Taiwan, Penghu Kinsmen, and Matsu for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China, as two equal political entities, would then be able to
negotiate (on political issues) and thus contribute to building peaceful cross-
strait relations, while Taiwan would gain greater  participation  in the
international  community,  Huang suggested.</P>
      <P>Professor Chang Yia-chung of National Taiwan University said that President Ma
Ying-jeou's recent call for China to remove its missiles aimed at Taiwan before
both sides can move to talk about a peace agreement is tantamount to "using the
missiles issue to say 'no' to a peace agreement."</P>
      <P>"It would not be a smart strategy," Chang commented.</P>
      <P>He added that a cross-strait peace agreement is "an issue that Taiwan and China
have to face sooner or later" since it involves the definition and content of
"one China" and the political identities of Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Since President Ma took office last year, Taiwan and China have signed nine
agreements to increase cross-strait non-political exchanges, and Taiwan has been
insisting on an "economics first and then politics" strategy in dealing with
China.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the idea of a cross-strait peace agreement has been "demonized"
by the opposition camp, and the ruling Kuomintang "dare not mention it" for fear
of repercussions in future elections.</P>
      <P>Chairman Huang Kun-huei of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) has
criticized the proposed cross-strait peace agreement as "a matter of
capitulation".</P>
      <P>Echoing Chang's view, senior journalist Nan Fang-shuo said that President Ma and
his administration should not try to "shift the responsibility of a peace
agreement onto the public, or even onto the United States and Japan", but
instead, should deal with it seriously.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) unveiled Friday a draft plan to raise the income
ceiling on which health insurance premiums are calculated, which is expected to

      <P>The plan, which is expected to boost the National Health Insurance system's
annual revenue by NT$1.3 billion, is set to be implemented next year after it is
approved by the Executive Yuan, according to Chu Tung-kuang,  deputy convener of
a DOH panel overseeing the insurance program.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, the existing monthly ceiling of NT$131,700 will be raised to
NT$212,000, and 13 new income tiers will be created.</P>
      <P>That means, for example, that those making NT$212,000 or more per month will owe
an additional NT$3,654 in premiums per month, based on the existing premium rate
of 4.55 percent.</P>
      <P>Because employees are only required to contribute 30 percent of the premium,
they will only have to pay an additional NT$1,096 per month, while their
employers, who contribute 60 percent, will have to pay an additional NT$2,192

      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang was noncommittal Friday
about easing restrictions on Canadian beef imports after the department
announced earlier in the day that imports of U.S. beef and beef products will be
relaxed.</P>
      <P>According to the latest DOH announcement, Taiwan will open its market to U.S.
bone-in beef from cattle younger than 30 months under a protocol signed by the
two countries in Washington, D.C., Thursday.</P>
      <P>Yaung said the DOH will revise current regulations governing the importation of
U.S. beef and beef products in terms of the newly sealed agreement on beef
imports, and if all goes smoothly, the new regulations will be formally unveiled
Nov. 10 at the earliest.</P>
      <P>Since January 2006, Taiwan has only allowed the import of U.S. de-boned beef and
beef products from cattle younger than 30 months.</P>
      <P>In June 2007, Taiwan also opened its market to Canadian beef and beef products
under the same conditions as those imposed on U.S. products.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the new market-opening measures to U.S. beef will also be
applicable to Canadian beef, Yaung said it will depend on bilateral negotiations
in the future.</P>
      <P>Yaung revealed that Canada's top representative to Taiwan paid him a visit
Friday morning.</P>
      <P>"We did touch on beef trade issues, but did not come to any conclusions in our
discussion, " Yaung said, declining to disclose details of their conversation.</P>
      <P>Taiwan banned U.S. beef in 2003 when a case of mad cow disease surfaced in
Seattle. The ban was lifted in April 2005 to allow imports of U.S. de-boned beef
from cattle under 30 months, but the government reimposed the ban two months
later when a second BSE case was discovered in the U.S.</P>
      <P>In 2006, the DOH agreed to the resumption of beef imports, but limited them to
boneless beef from cattle younger than 30 months and produced by certified
slaughterhouses, without any risky parts.</P>
      <P>Since then, U.S. beef imports have steadily increased to a record high of US$136
million in 2008,, despite the ban on bone-in beef.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Mid-term test report on locally-produced H1N1 vaccine released</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese people may soon get shots of a locally-produced H1N1 vaccine, as a
mid-term report on its initial effects in protecting people against the new flu
virus was released Friday.</P>
      <P>Chou Jih-haw, deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control under the
Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH), said Friday that based on a mid-term
assessment of human clinical test results submitted by the vaccine maker
Adimmune Corp. a day earlier, the DOH is leaning toward a very possible
conclusion that adults will need only one dose of the vaccine produced by the
company.</P>
      <P>But Chou said that the DOH will only reach a conclusion later Friday, after a
screening committee has reviewed all relevant data contained in the assessment
report.</P>
      <P>Adimmune is Taiwan's sole human vaccine manufacturer, and its human clinic tests
about the efficacy and safety of its vaccine targeted at mainly adults aged over
18 years. Adimmune has claimed that its H1N1 vaccine has the ability to provide
70 percent immunity against the virus in men and women older than 18 years of
age.</P>
      <P>The dose of Adimmune vaccine for children younger than 9 years will be
determined after test results on children are completed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the first batch of H1N1 vaccine produced by the Swiss-based
pharmaceutical firm Novartis arrived in Taiwan Thursday.</P>
      <P>The first 370,000 doses of the vaccine, part of the 5 million doses that Taiwan
has purchased from Novartis, will be distributed over the next few days to
designated spots around the country where the public will be able to get shots,
DOH officials said.</P>
      <P>The 5 million doses of vaccine will help meet local demand for about 12 million
doses.</P>
      <P>For children under the age of 9 years old, they have to receive two shots of the
Novartis vaccine, DOH officials said, while others above that age only need one
shot.</P>
      <P>As of Wednesday afternoon, the number of deaths from influenza A(H1N1) has hit
26 in Taiwan, with a 39-year-old woman from Taipei County listed as the latest
victim.</P>

    <HEADLINE>25 foreign officials attending ICDF workshop on agriculture</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 25 officials from 21 countries around the world are taking part in a
workshop in Taipei to learn from Taiwan's experience in developing agricultural
enterprises, the organizer of the workshop said Friday.</P>
      <P>The workshop is introducing  Taiwan's  current agricultural emphasis on
balancing agricultural production, sustainable lifestyles and the environment,
the International Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF) , which is sponsoring
the 13-day conference that opened Thursday, said in a statement.</P>
      <P>Though Taiwan has amassed agricultural technology and experience, its
agricultural sector has had to overcome major challenges to remain viable today.</P>
      <P>Sustainable and creative agricultural policies and development were one of the
key factors in Taiwan's strong economic performance over the past half century,
but that progress was threatened when Taiwan joined the World Trade Organization
in 2002, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Admission to the world trade forced Taiwan to open its once restricted market to
intense competition, and its limited natural resources and the small scale of
its farms left local farmers poorly positioned to compete with cheaper imported
agricultural goods.</P>
      <P>To cope with the challenge, Taiwan has encouraged its farmers to streamline
their operations  by transforming  themselves  into "agricultural  enterprises,
" an approach  that  has achieved satisfactory results and is one the ICDF said
can serve as a model for the world's developing countries.</P>
      <P>Workship participants will have the opportunity to see this approach in action
when they visit the Taipei Agricultural Products Marketing Corp., the Taichung
Agricultural Research and Extension Station, the Hsinkang Farmers' Association
in Chiayi County in central Taiwan, and several flower and botanical gardens
around the island.</P>
      <P>The ICDF has organized 15-20 workshops annually to help Taiwan's diplomatic
allies  and friendly  countries  train  people  in international trade,
agriculture, fisheries, information technology, and community development over
the past 15 years.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Many kinds of camps exist in Taiwan, but none had allowed ordinary citizens who
have never committed a crime to get a taste of life behind bars until Friday,
when a local prison opened its doors to those seeking a new experience.</P>
      <P>The Taoyuan Women's Prison in northern Taiwan took the initiative to "imprison"
90 individuals for a few hours Friday, hoping to instill them with more accurate
concepts of correctional facilities.</P>
      <P>The people who registered for the unprecedented program came from around Taiwan
and spanned various age groups and professions, prison administrators said.</P>
      <P>One woman in her 70s, who was accompanied by her daughter and grandson, said she
wanted to experience life behind bars because one of her family members used to
be a prison warden.</P>
      <P>Like convicts, the participants were required to pass through three heavily
guarded iron gates, undergo health checks and have their mug shots taken soon
after they arrived at 10 a.m. before being locked up.</P>
      <P>Laughter rang out frequently as many participants said they felt funny about
having their heights checked and mug shots taken under such circumstances.</P>
      <P>They were then locked up in cells accommodating about 10-15 people for much of
the rest of their stay, until 2 p.m. in the afternoon.</P>
      <P>They did get a respite from their cells at noon when they were fed lunch. Just
as with incarcerated criminals, who are required to give their serial numbers
during roll calls held before each meal, the participants were also required to
call out the numbers they had been given before eating.</P>
      <P>Fear was the most common sensation experienced by members of the group, who felt
uncomfortable being locked up in a guarded cell.</P>
      <P>"I could not but feel paralyzed by fear and anxiety when I heard the heavy sound
of the cell's iron gate closing, " said a young woman working at a university in
central Taiwan who took part in the program with her boyfriend.</P>
      <P>Cheng Mei-yu, head of the Taoyuan Women's Prison in Lungtan, Taoyuan County,
said her facility is now holding 1,300-plus inmates, far exceeding its capacity
of 1,000 prisoners.</P>
      <P>"About 70-to-80 percent of our inmates were drug addicts or involved in drug
trafficking, " Cheng said, adding that 12 of the prisoners are now pregnant.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the program for noncriminals was designed to help the public obtain
accurate information about the true conditions and functions of correctional
facilities.</P>
      <P>"Prisons are not as dark or humid as depicted in some motion pictures. But while
prisons are well equipped, inmates are not allowed to have contact with the
outside world," she said.</P>
      <P>"Being in jail will truly inflict physical and psychological pain on inmates. We
hope participants in today's event will let others know their feelings to help
deter crime or serve an educational purpose."</P>

      <P>Former Vice President Lien Chan, who serves as honorary chairman of the ruling
Kuomintang, will be named for the second consecutive year as President Ma Ying-
jeou's special envoy to the leaders summit of the 2009 Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum, according to sources close to the president.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Timothy Yang on Friday praised the former vice president as an
ideal envoy to the summit. He said that Taiwan's envoy to the Nov. 12-14 APEC
summit in Singapore has been decided and an official announcement will be made
very soon.</P>
      <P>In keeping with past practice, the Presidential Office will announce the name
after it has formally notified the APEC summit's host country of the appointee
via a special envoy who will return to Taiwan soon, Presidential Office
spokesman Wang Yu-chi said Monday.</P>
      <P>Political observers said that Taiwan's choice of envoy to APEC this year will be
seen a litmus test for cross-strait relations and a chance to strengthen
Taiwan-U.S. relations, as he or she will have the opportunity to meet U.S.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Law enforcement authorities in the outlying Kinmen County on Friday found a
household that has four times as many "ghost" residents as actual residents, as
they crack down on people illegally registered there ahead of year-end
elections.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Chang Han-sheng of the Kinmen District Prosecutors Office and other
judicial officials found that only the house's owner, surnamed Fan, and her
family of four members, actually resided in Kinmen, while 19 others registered
there were Taiwanese businessmen working in China or their children.</P>
      <P>Fan contended that the Taiwanese businessmen operating in China are friends of
her and were registered there only because of the generous benefits enjoyed by
Kinmen residents and not because of the upcoming election for county magistrate.</P>
      <P>Fan explained that when the "mini three links" were launched in 2001, only
Kinmen residents were allowed to take the convenient ferries between Kinmen and
Xiamen, compelling her friends to register their residences at her address to
facilitate their travel to and from China.</P>
      <P>Direct flights between Taiwan and China were not launched until 2008, prior to
which travelers between the two countries had to transit in third countries or
territories.</P>
      <P>Fan said that her friends later found that Kinmen residents also received 20
percent discounts on air tickets between Kinmen and Taiwan proper and could also
purchase the county's popular Kaoliang liquor -- a kind of strong liquor made of
fermented sorghum -- at a discount during Chinese New Year, the Dragon Boat
Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival.</P>
      <P>"They just don't want to move away, but they have never voted in elections," Fan
insisted.</P>
      <P>She said she could not turn down the requests of friends to register in her
household, but if the benefits offered by the county government were scrapped,
she was sure her friends would leave.</P>
      <P>The raid Friday was part of the county government's concerted effort to
eliminate the "ghost" population from voter rolls to ensure fair year-end,
"three-in-one" -- county magistrate, councilor, and township head -- elections.</P>
      <P>Seven candidates have registered for the county magistrate race.</P>
      <P>The investigation, which began earlier this year, initially found that out of
90,000 people registered as residents of Kinmen, some 5,000 are suspected of not
actually living there.</P>
      <P>Chang urged people not to falsely register their households in Kinmen and that
he would continue to persuade the "ghost" population to remove their names from
household registration lists.</P>
      <P>Observers said that checking on this "ghost" population has been the focus of
the present anti-bribery campaign, because with the island's small population,
elections are often decided by close margins.</P>
      <P>If one candidate were to mobilize the "ghost" population, it could easily swing
the outcome of the election.</P>

      <P>Twenty-one members of the ruling Kuomintang's Central Standing Committee (CSC)
had offered to resign as of Friday night amid criticism that the election for
seats on the party's decision-making body was marred by rampant bribery.</P>
      <P>"Given this large number of resignations, our Central Standing Committee is
scheduled to hold an extraordinary meeting next Monday to discuss how to tackle
the issue, " KMT spokesman Lee Chien-jung said at an evening news conference.</P>
      <P>"A by-election may have to be held if so many seats are really vacated," Lee
added.</P>
      <P>According to the KMT charter, the CSC has 39 members, with 32 elected by the
party's Central Committee members and seven designated by the party's chairman.</P>
      <P>The decision-making committee would have difficulty meeting the minimum number
of members needed to convene a meeting as stipulated in the country's Civic
Organizations Law, after the resignation of the 21 CSC members takes effect.</P>
      <P>Two other CSC members had already been stripped of their seats after probes
showed they had showered Central Committee members with gifts in exchange for
their votes in the Oct. 17 election.</P>
      <P>The mass resignation was inspired by outspoken Legislator Chiu Yi, who offered
on a political talk show Thursday night to give up his CSC seat to express his
displeasure over what he called the bad precedent set by the just-concluded CSC
election, in which many hopefuls were accused of hosting feasts or presenting
gifts to solicit votes.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, who doubles as KMT chairman, was quoted as having said
Friday afternoon that he would be pleased to see CSC members follow suit in
order to rebuild the CSC's reputation and authority.</P>
      <P>After Ma's words were spread by the party's spokesman, many CSC members offered
to relinquish their seats to signify their integrity and defend the party's
reputation.</P>

      <P>Angry about the government's decision to allow in U.S. bone-in beef, lawmakers
across party lines demanded Friday that Department of Health (DOH) officials
deliver a report on the issue to the Legislative Yuan on Oct. 26.</P>
      <P>Lu Hsueh-chang, a whip of the governing Kuomintang's legislative caucus, said
KMT legislators may reluctantly agree to imports of some types of bone-in beef
from the United States but will not accept imports of beef offals, as the
protocal with Washington seems to allow.</P>
      <P>The DOH announced earlier Friday that Taiwan would expand market access for U.S.
beef after officials of the two countries clinched an accord Thursday in
Washington D. C. to lift a partial ban on U.S. beef imports.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the new accord, U.S. bone-in beef, ground beef, intestines,
brains, spinal cords and processed beef from cattle younger than 30 months and
that have not been contaminated with "specific risk materials" will be allowed
to enter Taiwan starting Nov. 10.</P>
      <P>Specific risk materials are defined in the protocal as the brain, skull, eyes,
trigeminal ganglia, spinal cord, vertebral column and dorsal root ganglia from
cattle 30 months of age and older, or tonsils and the distal ileum of the small
intestine from cattle of all ages.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan only allows imports of U.S. boneless beef from cattle younger
than 30 months that contain no specified risk materials (SRMs).</P>
      <P>Lu blasted the DOH for failing to report in advance to relevant legislative
committees on the issue, because "in compliance with a 2006 legislative
resolution, the DOH is required to provide detailed reports about the
importation of U.S. beef to the legislature."</P>
      <P>Lu said he was extremely dissatisfied with the government's compromise on the
issue and demanded that the DOH immediately halt all related operations.</P>
      <P>"Otherwise, we will freeze the DOH's budget, " Lu said, after being briefed by
DOH Deputy Minister Hsiao Mei-ling on the issue Friday afternoon at the KMT
caucus office in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>In response to Hsiao's efforts to convince Lu of the safety of U.S. beef, Lu
said he felt ashamed by Hsiao's attitude and threatened to have those who defend
the liberalization measure step down, including Premier Wu Den-yih and DOH
Minister Yaung Chih-liang.</P>
      <P>For her part, Hsiao acknowledged that the DOH did not report to the legislature
before announcing the promulgation of U.S beef imports from next month.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party also
called a news conference Friday afternoon, accusing the DOH of breaching the law
by yielding to the United States.</P>
      <P>The United States has been pressuring Taiwan to open its market wider to U.S.
beef over the past three years.</P>
      <P>Taiwan first banned U.S. beef in 2003 when a case of mad cow disease surfaced in
Seattle. The ban was lifted in April 2005 to allow imports of U.S. de-boned beef
from cattle under 30 months, but the ban was reimposed two months later when a

    <HEADLINE>MOEA urges increases in exports to U.S., Europe</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 23 (CNA)

(By Lin Yi-feng &amp; Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) on Friday called for redoubled efforts
to increase Taiwan' s exports to the United States and Europe, the nation' s
second and third largest external markets, respectively.</P>
      <P>The ministry made the call as it released a report on Taiwan's export orders for
September, which recorded an 11-month high of US$30.837 billion.</P>
      <P>The total was only 3 percent lower than in September 2008, the lowest year-on-
year monthly decline in the 11 months since the global economic crisis broke out
late last year.</P>
      <P>China (including Hong Kong) remained the largest source of export orders
received by Taiwan last month. Orders from China grew 9.44 percent from the same
period a year earlier to US$8.262 billion and approached the historical high of
US$8.74 billion registered in August of 2008.</P>
      <P>Orders received from the United States totaled US$6.606 billion, a decrease of
10.6 percent from the same month last year, and orders from Europe amounted to
US$5.708 billion, representing a year-on-year decline of 13.44 percent.</P>
      <P>Orders from Japan and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries
rose from a year earlier. Japan placed orders for US$3.574 billion, a rise of
3.56 percent, and ASEAN countries ordered US$2.748 worth of goods, an increase
of 8.79 percent.</P>
      <P>Painting an optimistic picture for the final quarter of the year, MOEA
statistics chief Huang Chi-shih said that an upturn in the global economic
climate, the coming Christmas holidays and China's recently concluded "Oct. 1"
National Day holidays were factors that could contribute to an increase in
Taiwan's export orders in the fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>Huang said, however, that there was still room for Taiwan to further explore
U.S.  and European markets since the island's September export orders from China
were near their highest level ever.</P>
      <P>Further breaking down the orders,  the ministry said that electronics,
information and communications technology (ICT) goods and precision instruments
topped the list of export orders received by Taiwan in September.</P>
      <P>September's orders for electronic products totaled US$7.716 billion, a slight
decrease of 0.25 percent from the same month last year, while orders for ICT
goods stood at US$7.695 billion, up 2.41 percent, and at US$3.061 billion for
precision instruments, 11.84 percent higher than a year earlier.</P>

the liberalization measure step down, including Premier Wu Den-yih and DOH
Minister Yaung Chih-liang.</P>
      <P>For her part, Hsiao acknowledged that the DOH did not report to the legislature
before announcing the promulgation of U.S beef imports from next month.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party also
called a news conference Friday afternoon, accusing the DOH of breaching the law
by yielding to the United States.</P>
      <P>The United States has been pressuring Taiwan to open its market wider to U.S.
beef over the past three years.</P>
      <P>Taiwan first banned U.S. beef in 2003 when a case of mad cow disease surfaced in
Seattle. The ban was lifted in April 2005 to allow imports of U.S. de-boned beef
from cattle under 30 months, but the ban was reimposed two months later when a
second BSE case was discovered in the United States.</P>
      <P>In 2006, the DOH agreed to allow beef imports once again, but limited them to
boneless beef from cattle younger than 30 months produced by certified
slaughterhouses and without any risky parts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA urges increases in exports to U.S., Europe</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) on Friday called for redoubled efforts
to increase Taiwan' s exports to the United States and Europe, the nation' s
second and third largest external markets, respectively.</P>
      <P>The ministry made the call as it released a report on Taiwan's export orders for
September, which recorded an 11-month high of US$30.837 billion.</P>
      <P>The total was only 3 percent lower than in September 2008, the lowest year-on-
year monthly decline in the 11 months since the global economic crisis broke out
late last year.</P>
      <P>China (including Hong Kong) remained the largest source of export orders
received by Taiwan last month. Orders from China grew 9.44 percent from the same
period a year earlier to US$8.262 billion and approached the historical high of
US$8.74 billion registered in August of 2008.</P>
      <P>Orders received from the United States totaled US$6.606 billion, a decrease of
10.6 percent from the same month last year, and orders from Europe amounted to
US$5.708 billion, representing a year-on-year decline of 13.44 percent.</P>
      <P>Orders from Japan and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries
rose from a year earlier. Japan placed orders for US$3.574 billion, a rise of
3.56 percent, and ASEAN countries ordered US$2.748 worth of goods, an increase
of 8.79 percent.</P>
      <P>Painting an optimistic picture for the final quarter of the year, MOEA
statistics chief Huang Chi-shih said that an upturn in the global economic
climate, the coming Christmas holidays and China's recently concluded "Oct. 1"
National Day holidays were factors that could contribute to an increase in
Taiwan's export orders in the fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>Huang said, however, that there was still room for Taiwan to further explore
U.S.  and European markets since the island's September export orders from China
were near their highest level ever.</P>
      <P>Further breaking down the orders,  the ministry said that electronics,
information and communications technology (ICT) goods and precision instruments
topped the list of export orders received by Taiwan in September.</P>
      <P>September's orders for electronic products totaled US$7.716 billion, a slight
decrease of 0.25 percent from the same month last year, while orders for ICT
goods stood at US$7.695 billion, up 2.41 percent, and at US$3.061 billion for
precision instruments, 11.84 percent higher than a year earlier.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Kinmen authorities continue investigation of 'ghost' population</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Law enforcement authorities in the outlying Kinmen County on Friday found a
household that has four times as many "ghost" residents as actual residents, as
they crack down on people illegally registered there ahead of year-end
elections.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Chang Han-sheng of the Kinmen District Prosecutors Office and other
judicial officials found that only the house's owner, surnamed Fan, and her
family of four members, actually resided in Kinmen, while 19 others registered
there were Taiwanese businessmen working in China or their children.</P>
      <P>Fan contended that the Taiwanese businessmen operating in China are friends of
her and were registered there only because of the generous benefits enjoyed by
Kinmen residents and not because of the upcoming election for county magistrate.</P>
      <P>Fan explained that when the "mini three links" were launched in 2001, only
Kinmen residents were allowed to take the convenient ferries between Kinmen and
Xiamen, compelling her friends to register their residences at her address to
facilitate their travel to and from China.</P>
      <P>Direct flights between Taiwan and China were not launched until 2008, prior to
which travelers between the two countries had to transit in third countries or
territories.</P>
      <P>Fan said that her friends later found that Kinmen residents also received 20
percent discounts on air tickets between Kinmen and Taiwan proper and could also
purchase the county's popular Kaoliang liquor -- a kind of strong liquor made of
fermented sorghum -- at a discount during Chinese New Year, the Dragon Boat
Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival.</P>
      <P>"They just don't want to move away, but they have never voted in elections," Fan
insisted.</P>
      <P>She said she could not turn down the requests of friends to register in her
household, but if the benefits offered by the county government were scrapped,
she was sure her friends would leave.</P>
      <P>The raid Friday was part of the county government's concerted effort to
eliminate the "ghost" population from voter rolls to ensure fair year-end,
"three-in-one" -- county magistrate, councilor, and township head -- elections.</P>
      <P>Seven candidates have registered for the county magistrate race.</P>
      <P>The investigation, which began earlier this year, initially found that out of
90,000 people registered as residents of Kinmen, some 5,000 are suspected of not
actually living there.</P>
      <P>Chang urged people not to falsely register their households in Kinmen and that
he would continue to persuade the "ghost" population to remove their names from
household registration lists.</P>
      <P>Observers said that checking on this "ghost" population has been the focus of
the present anti-bribery campaign, because with the island's small population,
elections are often decided by close margins.</P>
      <P>If one candidate were to mobilize the "ghost" population, it could easily swing
the outcome of the election.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Twenty-one members of the ruling Kuomintang's Central Standing Committee (CSC)
had offered to resign as of Friday night amid criticism that the election for
seats on the party's decision-making body was marred by rampant bribery.</P>
      <P>"Given this large number of resignations, our Central Standing Committee is
scheduled to hold an extraordinary meeting next Monday to discuss how to tackle
the issue, " KMT spokesman Lee Chien-jung said at an evening news conference.</P>
      <P>"A by-election may have to be held if so many seats are really vacated," Lee
added.</P>
      <P>According to the KMT charter, the CSC has 39 members, with 32 elected by the
party's Central Committee members and seven designated by the party's chairman.</P>
      <P>The decision-making committee would have difficulty meeting the minimum number
of members needed to convene a meeting as stipulated in the country's Civic
Organizations Law, after the resignation of the 21 CSC members takes effect.</P>
      <P>Two other CSC members had already been stripped of their seats after probes
showed they had showered Central Committee members with gifts in exchange for
their votes in the Oct. 17 election.</P>
      <P>The mass resignation was inspired by outspoken Legislator Chiu Yi, who offered
on a political talk show Thursday night to give up his CSC seat to express his
displeasure over what he called the bad precedent set by the just-concluded CSC
election, in which many hopefuls were accused of hosting feasts or presenting
gifts to solicit votes.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, who doubles as KMT chairman, was quoted as having said
Friday afternoon that he would be pleased to see CSC members follow suit in
order to rebuild the CSC's reputation and authority.</P>
      <P>After Ma's words were spread by the party's spokesman, many CSC members offered
to relinquish their seats to signify their integrity and defend the party's
reputation.</P>

      <P>Angry about the government's decision to allow in U.S. bone-in beef, lawmakers
across party lines demanded Friday that Department of Health (DOH) officials
deliver a report on the issue to the Legislative Yuan on Oct. 26.</P>
      <P>Lu Hsueh-chang, a whip of the governing Kuomintang's legislative caucus, said
KMT legislators may reluctantly agree to imports of some types of bone-in beef
from the United States but will not accept imports of beef offals, as the
protocal with Washington seems to allow.</P>
      <P>The DOH announced earlier Friday that Taiwan would expand market access for U.S.
beef after officials of the two countries clinched an accord Thursday in
Washington D. C. to lift a partial ban on U.S. beef imports.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the new accord, U.S. bone-in beef, ground beef, intestines,
brains, spinal cords and processed beef from cattle younger than 30 months and
that have not been contaminated with "specific risk materials" will be allowed
to enter Taiwan starting Nov. 10.</P>
      <P>Specific risk materials are defined in the protocal as the brain, skull, eyes,
trigeminal ganglia, spinal cord, vertebral column and dorsal root ganglia from
cattle 30 months of age and older, or tonsils and the distal ileum of the small
intestine from cattle of all ages.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan only allows imports of U.S. boneless beef from cattle younger
than 30 months that contain no specified risk materials (SRMs).</P>
      <P>Lu blasted the DOH for failing to report in advance to relevant legislative
committees on the issue, because "in compliance with a 2006 legislative
resolution, the DOH is required to provide detailed reports about the
importation of U.S. beef to the legislature."</P>
      <P>Lu said he was extremely dissatisfied with the government's compromise on the
issue and demanded that the DOH immediately halt all related operations.</P>
      <P>"Otherwise, we will freeze the DOH's budget, " Lu said, after being briefed by
DOH Deputy Minister Hsiao Mei-ling on the issue Friday afternoon at the KMT
caucus office in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>In response to Hsiao's efforts to convince Lu of the safety of U.S. beef, Lu
said he felt ashamed by Hsiao's attitude and threatened to have those who defend
the liberalization measure step down, including Premier Wu Den-yih and DOH

    <HEADLINE>British company to partner with local firm on developing wind power</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A leading British renewable energy development company is planning to enter a
partnership with a Taiwanese firm to further develop wind power in Taiwan,
according to a recent newsletter published by the British Trade and Cultural
Office (BTCO) in Taipei.</P>
      <P>SeaEnergy PLC and Taiwan Generations Corporation (TGC) will sign a memorandum of
understanding Oct. 27 to jointly develop offshore windfarm projects in Taiwan,
the newsletter said.</P>
      <P>"This joint project by SeaEnergy and TGC will be the first offshore windfarm
collaboration between the U.K. and Taiwan, which also demonstrates the
international and local business support for the government's policy," the BTCO
said.</P>
      <P>The British representative office was referring to the passage of a long-awaited
renewable energy development statute that cleared the legislative floor June 12.
The legislation lays down a legal framework for encouraging investment in
renewable energy production and offering incentives to local consumers who
install renewable energy equipment.</P>
      <P>In addition to permitting state-run Taiwan Power Co. to buy electricity
generated by private renewable energy investors, the bill also authorizes the
government to take measures to expedite the development of renewable energy
technologies.</P>
      <P>According to the BTCO, SeaEnergy is the only listed offshore wind energy company
in the U.K. and an expert in the field.</P>
      <P>TGC, which is a leading local offshore windfarm development company and one of
Taiwan's few energy project development firms, has conducted nearly 5 years of
feasibility studies for a Changhua offshore windfarm project and has already
secured 11 permits and approval from the central government and the local
authorities.</P>
      <P>TGC is attempting to establish a platform for international players to bring in
resources and successful development experience that can help Taiwan meet the
goal of renewable energy development and win global recognition in the field.</P>
      <P>According to the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) ,
installed local wind power capacity in 2008 reached 358,000 kilowatts, making
the country the world's 23rd-largest producer of wind power.</P>
      <P>Under a new government policy to develop green energy, Taiwan aims to boost wind
power capacity to 980,000 kilowatts by 2010, to 1.48 million kilowatts by 2015
and to 3 million kilowatts by 2025, the CEPD said.</P>

more public sector jobs available, CEPD Chairman Tsai Hsung-hsiung said in an
interview with CNA.</P>
      <P>"Although the economy has gradually started to recover, the overall jobless rate
will remain high if these people are unable to get back into the job market, and
the government has noted the significance of the problem," said Tsai, who took
office Sept. 10.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the CEPD will propose a new employment program after discussions with
the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA), which intends to increase the number of
short-term employment opportunities or enhance existing employment and
vocational training.</P>
      <P>It might also consider creating more jobs in the public sector or assisting the
private sector to cooperate with the government, Tsai went on.</P>
      <P>However, the government is also concerned that some jobless people will become
welfare-dependent, he continued, so that the CEPD will think the program through
more carefully before proposing it to the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's employment situation over the past five months has been
improving, so that Taiwan might be able to avoid a situation in which market
capital flows only into the local stock market or real estate market, which does
not provide much help in generating new jobs.</P>
      <P>"The government needs to expand private sector investment, which should become
our target, " Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Tsai said last month that Taiwan had passed through the darkest days of the
economic downturn. With the launch of public construction projects designed to
stimulate domestic demand, as well as post- flood restoration projects, more and
more jobs will be on offer, he said in his first report to the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's jobless rate dropped to 6.04 percent in September, 0.09 percentage
points down from a record high of 6.13 percent recorded in August.  The number
of unemployed  people totalled 661,000 in September, down 11,000 from the
previous month.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Pro-independence groups in southern Taiwan announced Saturday a plan to stage a
demonstration in Taichung in December to express their opposition to the
proposed signing of an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with
China.</P>
      <P>The organizations, led by the Southern Taiwan Society and Formosa News, said
such an agreement must be blocked because it will seriously impact Taiwan's
industrial sector and worsen the country's unemployment situation.</P>
      <P>The demonstration will take place at the same time as a fourth round of talks
between Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits President Chen
Yunlin, which will be held in the second half of December in the central city.</P>
      <P>According to Formosa News President Chen Chi-mai, although the administration of
President Ma Ying-jeou has said the ECFA will benefit 700,000 people in Taiwan,
another 1.6 million people will see their livelihoods threatened after the
establishment of the pact.</P>
      <P>Chen predicted that the agreement will bring more disadvantages than benefits
and will make Taiwan's economic situation even worse.</P>
      <P>Accusing the Ma administration of paying no attention to the voices against the
ECFA, Chen said the groups will mobilize 1 million people to take part in the
demonstration to display "the people's power."</P>
      <P>The pro-independence opposition Democratic Progressive Party, which fears the
ECFA will undermine Taiwan's sovereignty, has requested that the government hold
a referendum to allow the people to decide whether the agreement should be
signed.</P>
      <P>The request, however, has been refused.</P>

      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said Saturday that the city's garbage volume has dropped
by 56.2 percent in the 10 years since a compulsory garbage classification system
was enforced.</P>
      <P>Hu made the remarks when he attended the inauguration of a kitchen leftovers
processing zone at the city's garbage disposal facility.</P>
      <P>The first city in the country to enforce classified garbage collection system --
in 1999 -- Taichung also started to encourage households to separate kitchen
leftovers from their general garbage the following year.</P>
      <P>In 2003, a factory was set up in the garbage disposal facility to process
kitchen leftovers into fertilizer and chicken feed and today, with a subsidy of
NT$50 million from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Executive
Yuan, the city's environmental protection department has developed a special
zone for managing kitchen leftovers that includes the processing factory, a
chicken farm and an ecology park.</P>
      <P>According to Hu, the city's garbage recycling rate has been raised from 8.9
percent in 1999 to 43.5 percent in 2009.</P>
      <P>EPA statistics show that per capita daily garbage disposal in Taichung has
continued to drop in the past five years and that at 0.367 kg per person per
day, is the second-lowest among all cities and counties in the nation, behind
only the outlying island county of Kinmen.</P>

      <P>The secretary of the Jiangsu provincial committee of the Communist Party of
China (CPC), who is also a member of the party's Central Committee, will lead a
large purchasing delegation on a visit to Taiwan Nov. 9, one of the organizers
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) , Liang Baohua
will be the highest-level communist Chinese official to have visited Taiwan --
the Central Committee of the CPC is the party's top decision-making body.</P>
      <P>Political observers said Liang's visit signals that cross-Taiwan Strait
cooperation in the areas of economy and trade are back on track following the
hiccup caused by the Kaohsiung city government's decision to invite Tibet's
spiritual leader the Dalai Lama to visit Taiwan and the city's screening of a
documentary on exiled Uighur activist Rebiya Kadeer.</P>
      <P>More than 1,000 businessmen from the eastern province will be in the delegation
and are expected to spend more than US$1 billion, according to TAITRA.</P>
      <P>The delegation, which will be divided into more than 10 groups, also includes
some top management from around 50 well-known Jiangsu enterprises, including
Sinopec Yangzi Petrochemical Company and China Resources' Suguo Supermarket --
one of China's top chainstores.</P>
      <P>While in Taiwan, the delegation will engage in trade talks, visit a number of
Taiwanese companies and attend seminars. Liang will also meet various
politicians, TAITRA said.</P>
      <P>Prior to Liang's  visit,  another  two Chinese  purchasing delegations, one from
Sichuan Province and one from the city of Guangzhou, will arrive Nov. 2.</P>
      <P>The Sichuan group, which consists of representatives of 35 companies from a

group, will hold purchasing conferences and trade meetings Nov. 2 and Nov. 4,

      <P>The government will need at least NT$25 billion in the initial stage if nursing
care is to be included in the nation's universal health insurance coverage,
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) Chairman Tsai Hsung-hsiung
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Tsai told CNA that the CEPD has prepared an evaluation report on nursing care
insurance and that a draft of a nursing care bill will be submitted to the
Legislative Yuan at the end of the year.</P>
      <P>While the Department of Health under the Executive Yuan is working on a legal
framework for nursing care insurance, the CEPD has studied the possible
financial sources that would be needed to pay for the program, which is expected
to be realized in 2011.</P>
      <P>Tsai disclosed that the CEPD will suggest that the government, employers and
employees share the cost of the insurance premiums, although the ratio of
contributions has yet to be decided.</P>
      <P>Like many developed countries, Taiwan is facing the problem of an aging
population. CEPD statistics indicate that 22.5 percent of the population will be
aged 65 and over by 2028, while the number of the disabled will have increased

    <TEXT>
      <P>With the road leading to one of Taiwan's most popular tourist attractions -- the
Alishan Forest Recreation Area -- finally re-opened to small vehicles, the
minister of transportation and communications said Saturday that he wants the
highway further restored and open to medium-size buses by Nov. 20.</P>
      <P>Mao Chi-kuo said he has demanded further repairs so that the highway can be used
by 22-seater buses that can boost the tourist trade in the Alishan area, which
fell victim to Typhoon Morakot that battered southern Taiwan with massive
flooding and landslides in early August.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, a ceremony was held at Chiayi County's Chukou village, the
starting point of the Alishan Highway -- also known as Highway No. 18 -- to mark
the road's re-opening after over eight weeks of restoration work.</P>
      <P>Also that day,  the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications launched a free shuttle bus service on the highway, using nine-
seater mini-vans running every 30 minutes to take tourists to the recreation
area.</P>
      <P>The buses will stop at the Chiayi Station of the High-Speed Railway, the Chiayi
Railway Station, Xiding, Shizhao, Longtou and Fenchihu. Those who want to use
the service will need to book at least three days in advance using the toll-free
number 0800-210-589, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>Asked when the highway will be re-opened to large coaches, Mao said only that
"safety comes above all" and that large vehicles will not be allowed to use the
road until it is safe to do so.</P>
      <P>Chiayi Magistrate Chen Ming-wen has described the Alishan area as the county's
most important economic lifeline. The road closure meant that tourists were
unable to visit and even the transportation of agricultural products was
affected, he said.</P>
      <P>"Prices at the Fenchihu Hotel, which was once so popular it was difficult to get
a room, are down 90 percent, " one traveler from Taichung surnamed Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Chen drove to Fenchihu, a popular Alishan tourist destination, along with his
wife and four friends Friday, the first day the road was opened.</P>
      <P>Rooms were as cheap as NT$280 per night, according to Chen's wife. Besides, the
condition of the road is very good and the landscape of Alishan is the same as
it ever was -- "beyond perfect! " Chen said.</P>
      <P>The re-opening of the road was not just good news for local tourists, but also
those from China, who regard Alishan as one of the must-visit sightseeing spots
in Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) looks set to hold a by-election for members of its
Central Standing Committee (CSC) following a mass resignation of members of the
party's policy-making body, KMT spokesman Lee Chien-jung said Saturday.</P>
      <P>As of that day, 25 of the 32 elected CSC members had decided to step down over
criticism that the Sept. 11 CSC election was marred by rampant vote-buying.</P>
      <P>The party kicked two members out of the CSC Oct. 20 for their involvement in
vote-buying during the election, but the move failed to stop mounting calls from
party members for a new election of the CSC.</P>
      <P>Outspoken KMT Legislator Chiu Yi took the initial decision to give up his CSC
membership during a political talk show Oct. 22 to express his displeasure  over
what he described as "the evil precedent" in the CSC election in which many
candidates were accused of having hosted banquets or distributed gifts in
exchange for votes.</P>
      <P>Chiu was followed by several reform-minded committee members who asked for a new
CSC election in a bid to "re-build the KMT's image as a clean and reform-
orientated party."</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, who doubles as KMT chairman, said Friday that he would
be pleased to see other CSC members follow suit in a bid to improve the CSC's
integrity.</P>
      <P>After Ma's comments were spread by the party spokesman, more CSC members offered
to relinquish their seats to signify their integrity and defend the party's
reputation, making a new round of elections possible.</P>
      <P>With the resignations, the CSC would have difficulty meeting the minimum number
of members required to convene a meeting as stipulated under the nation's s
Civic Organization Law.</P>
      <P>Under the KMT charter, the CSC has 39 seats, 32 of which are elected by the
party's Central Committee members and the remaining seven designated by the
party chairman.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, two other CSC members had expressed their desire to step down,
while 13 of the 14 eligible alternatives had also agreed to renounce their
rights to fill the vacancies left by the resigning members, making it possible
that almost all of CSC's non-designated members will have to be decided upon
through the by-election.</P>
      <P>Lee said the KMT will convene an extraordinary CSC meeting Oct. 26 to decide how
to go ahead with the by-election,</P>

      <P>World acclaimed shoe designer Jimmy Choo shared his experience Saturday of
building his couture shoe-making empire at the Education U.K. Autumn Exhibition
in Taipei, saying that hard-work, devotion and gratitude are the keys to
success.</P>
      <P>"Young designers should never be afraid of challenges and hardship because hard-
working, devoutness and being grateful are what make one successful," Choo said.</P>
      <P>"Whatever you do, never wait until tomorrow. Finish your work today because
success will not waiting for you tomorrow," he added.</P>
      <P>Choo made the remarks at a forum on the sidelines of the Oct. 24-25 exhibition
being organized by the British Council,  an organization  that  promotes
education,  creative  ideas  and international cultural relations.</P>
      <P>Born in Penang, Malaysia into a family of shoemakers, Choo founded Jimmy Choo
Ltd. in 1996 with Tamara Mellon, an editor for Vogue magazine, and become one of
the world's most renowned shoe designers.</P>
      <P>Celebrity and royal patronage, such as that of Britain's late Princess Diana and
U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama, further boosted his image and in 2001, he sold
his 50 percent stake in the company to concentrate on his exclusive Jimmy Choo
Couture line.</P>
      <P>Recalling the time studying at London's Cordwainers Technical College, which is
now part of the London College of Fashion, Choo said he had to work part-time to
pay his tuition and that his career was not all smooth sailing after graduation.</P>
      <P>There was a time when he had to make 50 pairs of US$10 shoes per week just to
pay his expenses because his name was unknown, Choo said.</P>
      <P>Today, his couture shoes cost at least 10 times than much and there is a long
waiting list, he added.</P>
      <P>In 1988, his creations were featured in a record eight pages in the August
issue  of Vogue magazine,  bringing  international recognition to his
craftsmanship and designs.</P>
      <P>"I never blame the gods or anyone else for my hardships. I work hard and am
devoted to what I do because there is no shortcut to success," Choo said.</P>
      <P>Standing in front of a mini-exhibition of his shoes, Choo said he was very happy
to act as an education ambassador for the British Council.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) said Saturday that credit-based tuition fees for
Chinese students studying at local public universities have been finalized at
about NT$2,100 (US$65) per credit, which is 1.5 times that of the average
NT$1,400 charged by private universities.</P>
      <P>The credit fees were decided in a MOE meeting the previous day with
representatives of local universities and colleges,  Vice Minister of Education
Lin Tsong-ming said in an interview with CNA.</P>
      <P>Lin said the new tuition policy will not apply to Chinese students who have
already enrolled in local universities.</P>
      <P>He also said the MOE will respect student exchange programs signed between
universities on either side of the Taiwan Strait and that the new tuition rule
will not apply to such exchange students.</P>
      <P>The new measures mean that tuition fees for Chinese students enrolling will now
be closer to NT$80,000 per year, according to the MOE.</P>
      <P>In the past, the MOE has allowed each college and university decide individually
on the tuition fees for Chinese students, but it has questioned this practice as
some local schools have enrolled Chinese students at only NT$47,500 per year.</P>
      <P>Tuition fees at China's public universities vary from NT$23,700 to NT$47,500 per
year, according to a report from the China Youth and Children Research Center.</P>
      <P>The MOE also said it had no plans to revise the existing cap on the number of
Chinese  students  allowed  to enroll in local universities and colleges.</P>
      <P>According to MOE statistics, there are around 300 Chinese students enrolled in
local universities, much lower than the annual cap of 1,000 students.</P>

number 0800-210-589, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>Asked when the highway will be re-opened to large coaches, Mao said only that
"safety comes above all" and that large vehicles will not be allowed to use the
road until it is safe to do so.</P>
      <P>Chiayi Magistrate Chen Ming-wen has described the Alishan area as the county's
most important economic lifeline. The road closure meant that tourists were
unable to visit and even the transportation of agricultural products was
affected, he said.</P>
      <P>"Prices at the Fenchihu Hotel, which was once so popular it was difficult to get
a room, are down 90 percent, " one traveler from Taichung surnamed Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Chen drove to Fenchihu, a popular Alishan tourist destination, along with his
wife and four friends Friday, the first day the road was opened.</P>
      <P>Rooms were as cheap as NT$280 per night, according to Chen's wife. Besides, the
condition of the road is very good and the landscape of Alishan is the same as
it ever was -- "beyond perfect! " Chen said.</P>
      <P>The re-opening of the road was not just good news for local tourists, but also
those from China, who regard Alishan as one of the must-visit sightseeing spots
in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT set to hold by-election for decision making body</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) looks set to hold a by-election for members of its
Central Standing Committee (CSC) following a mass resignation of members of the
party's policy-making body, KMT spokesman Lee Chien-jung said Saturday.</P>
      <P>As of that day, 25 of the 32 elected CSC members had decided to step down over
criticism that the Sept. 11 CSC election was marred by rampant vote-buying.</P>
      <P>The party kicked two members out of the CSC Oct. 20 for their involvement in
vote-buying during the election, but the move failed to stop mounting calls from
party members for a new election of the CSC.</P>
      <P>Outspoken KMT Legislator Chiu Yi took the initial decision to give up his CSC
membership during a political talk show Oct. 22 to express his displeasure  over
what he described as "the evil precedent" in the CSC election in which many
candidates were accused of having hosted banquets or distributed gifts in
exchange for votes.</P>
      <P>Chiu was followed by several reform-minded committee members who asked for a new
CSC election in a bid to "re-build the KMT's image as a clean and reform-
orientated party."</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, who doubles as KMT chairman, said Friday that he would
be pleased to see other CSC members follow suit in a bid to improve the CSC's
integrity.</P>
      <P>After Ma's comments were spread by the party spokesman, more CSC members offered
to relinquish their seats to signify their integrity and defend the party's
reputation, making a new round of elections possible.</P>
      <P>With the resignations, the CSC would have difficulty meeting the minimum number
of members required to convene a meeting as stipulated under the nation's s
Civic Organization Law.</P>
      <P>Under the KMT charter, the CSC has 39 seats, 32 of which are elected by the
party's Central Committee members and the remaining seven designated by the
party chairman.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, two other CSC members had expressed their desire to step down,
while 13 of the 14 eligible alternatives had also agreed to renounce their
rights to fill the vacancies left by the resigning members, making it possible
that almost all of CSC's non-designated members will have to be decided upon
through the by-election.</P>
      <P>Lee said the KMT will convene an extraordinary CSC meeting Oct. 26 to decide how
to go ahead with the by-election,</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>World acclaimed shoe designer Jimmy Choo shared his experience Saturday of
building his couture shoe-making empire at the Education U.K. Autumn Exhibition
in Taipei, saying that hard-work, devotion and gratitude are the keys to
success.</P>
      <P>"Young designers should never be afraid of challenges and hardship because hard-
working, devoutness and being grateful are what make one successful," Choo said.</P>
      <P>"Whatever you do, never wait until tomorrow. Finish your work today because
success will not waiting for you tomorrow," he added.</P>
      <P>Choo made the remarks at a forum on the sidelines of the Oct. 24-25 exhibition
being organized by the British Council,  an organization  that  promotes
education,  creative  ideas  and international cultural relations.</P>
      <P>Born in Penang, Malaysia into a family of shoemakers, Choo founded Jimmy Choo
Ltd. in 1996 with Tamara Mellon, an editor for Vogue magazine, and become one of
the world's most renowned shoe designers.</P>
      <P>Celebrity and royal patronage, such as that of Britain's late Princess Diana and
U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama, further boosted his image and in 2001, he sold
his 50 percent stake in the company to concentrate on his exclusive Jimmy Choo
Couture line.</P>
      <P>Recalling the time studying at London's Cordwainers Technical College, which is
now part of the London College of Fashion, Choo said he had to work part-time to
pay his tuition and that his career was not all smooth sailing after graduation.</P>
      <P>There was a time when he had to make 50 pairs of US$10 shoes per week just to
pay his expenses because his name was unknown, Choo said.</P>
      <P>Today, his couture shoes cost at least 10 times than much and there is a long
waiting list, he added.</P>
      <P>In 1988, his creations were featured in a record eight pages in the August
issue  of Vogue magazine,  bringing  international recognition to his
craftsmanship and designs.</P>
      <P>"I never blame the gods or anyone else for my hardships. I work hard and am
devoted to what I do because there is no shortcut to success," Choo said.</P>
      <P>Standing in front of a mini-exhibition of his shoes, Choo said he was very happy
to act as an education ambassador for the British Council.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) said Saturday that credit-based tuition fees for
Chinese students studying at local public universities have been finalized at
about NT$2,100 (US$65) per credit, which is 1.5 times that of the average
NT$1,400 charged by private universities.</P>
      <P>The credit fees were decided in a MOE meeting the previous day with
representatives of local universities and colleges,  Vice Minister of Education
Lin Tsong-ming said in an interview with CNA.</P>
      <P>Lin said the new tuition policy will not apply to Chinese students who have
already enrolled in local universities.</P>
      <P>He also said the MOE will respect student exchange programs signed between
universities on either side of the Taiwan Strait and that the new tuition rule
will not apply to such exchange students.</P>
      <P>The new measures mean that tuition fees for Chinese students enrolling will now
be closer to NT$80,000 per year, according to the MOE.</P>
      <P>In the past, the MOE has allowed each college and university decide individually
on the tuition fees for Chinese students, but it has questioned this practice as
some local schools have enrolled Chinese students at only NT$47,500 per year.</P>
      <P>Tuition fees at China's public universities vary from NT$23,700 to NT$47,500 per
year, according to a report from the China Youth and Children Research Center.</P>
      <P>The MOE also said it had no plans to revise the existing cap on the number of
Chinese  students  allowed  to enroll in local universities and colleges.</P>
      <P>According to MOE statistics, there are around 300 Chinese students enrolled in
local universities, much lower than the annual cap of 1,000 students.</P>

      <P>National Taiwan University (NTU) President Lee Si-chen expressed hope Saturday
that the government will continue promoting a project to develop some of the
nation's universities into some of the best in the world, the first five-year
stage of which will expire at the end of 2010.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the project, NTU recently achieved 95th place in the Higher Education
league table of the London Times newspaper, up from 124th in 2008 and marking
the first time a Taiwanese school has ranked among the world's top 100
universities on such a list.</P>
      <P>Lee said he hopes the project will go on forever and that with funding, he
believes NTU can become one of the world's top 50 or even top 10 universities.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks at a ceremony to present the results of the five-year, NT$50
billion (US$1.54 billion) project aimed at boosting the quality of local
academic institutions. Minister of Education Wu Ching-chi, Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company Chairman Morris Chang and Ministry of Education (MOE)
Department of Higher Education Director Ho Cho-fey attended the event.</P>
      <P>NTU's new ranking is seen as an encouraging result, as one of the project's
goals is to cultivate top-level universities and research centers in global
terms.</P>
      <P>Under the program, the government has allocated NT$10 billion per year to
subsidize applied universities and research institutes in efforts to improve
their educational facilities and research quality.</P>
      <P>In response to Lee's call, Wu promised that the plan will indeed continue and
noted that it has the firm support of President Ma Ying-jeou.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President vows to sweep cross-strait hatred into history</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou vowed Sunday on the Taiwan-held island of Kinmen to
dissolve "the hatred" across the Taiwan Strait with the greatest sincerity so as
to sweep killing into history and secure eternal peace between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Addressing a ceremony to mark the 60th anniversary of the Battle of Kuningtou --
in which Kuomintang troops repulsed an attempted invasion by Chinese communist
forces of Kinmen in 1949 -- Ma said the battle rewrote modern Chinese history
and ushered in an era in which Taiwan and China are separate and ruled by
different governments.</P>
      <P>The battle occurred soon after the ROC government relocated its seat from China
to Taiwan after being defeated in the Chinese civil war in early 1949.</P>
      <P>Some 10,000 Chinese communist troops made shore on Kinmen's Kuningtou beach on
the night of Oct. 25, 1949 for a surprise attack, sparking a bitter conflict
that lasted for three days. Some 7,000 People's Liberation Army soldiers were
taken prisoner and around 3,000 were killed, while 1,200 ROC troops died.</P>
      <P>"We should offer our gratitude to the ROC soldiers who sacrificed their lives in
the battle to give Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu 60 years to develop in
peace," Ma said.</P>
      <P>He said the Battle of Kuningtou could easily be forgotten in comparison to other
much more turbulent periods since the early 20th Century, when millions of
people were killed in the Warlord Era, followed by the anti-Japanese war and the
ensuing rise of the Chinese communists, but the battle represents an important
and crucial page in modern Chinese history, as it changed the fate of both
Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>It marked a watershed in modern Chinese history, as it allowed two political and
economic entities with different ideologies to begin their differing experiments
on either side of the Taiwan Strait, he continued.</P>
      <P>Over the past 60 years, he went on, Taiwan first strived to exist in the
conflict  between  the  two facets  of democracy  and totalitarianism, and then
endeavored to develop itself into a democratic economy amid competition among
the United States, Japan and China.</P>
      <P>By comparison, he noted,  China has experienced a totally different 60 years,
with the first three decades witnessing the most turbulent, distressing era in
which many millions of people died, families were broken and societal core
values collapsed.</P>
      <P>"China experienced more trying, untold sufferings than Taiwan did in that
period," he said.</P>
      <P>However, in the most recent 30 years, China has continued conducting social and
economic reforms via its unique "socialism with Chinese characteristics, "
eventually leading to China's rise on the world stage, he said.</P>
      <P>The president traveled to Kinmen to attend the ceremony in the company of
Minister of National Defense Kao Hua-chu, National Security Council Secretary-
General Su Chi and other high-ranking officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan formally enters international prosecutors organization</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has recently  joined  the International Association of Prosecutors (IAP)
, the only global non-government organization of prosecutors, under the title of
Chinese Taipei, the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>After twists and turns regarding its title, Taiwan was finally notified by IAP
Secretary-General Henk Marquart Scholtz Oct. 20 that it had been admitted into
the body as an organizational member under the name Chinese Taipei, the MOJ
said.</P>
      <P>The membership will allow Taiwan's MOJ and public prosecutors to share with
other IAP members resources related to mutual judicial assistance and to host
international IAP meetings.</P>
      <P>The IAP was established by the United Nations in 1995 in Vienna due to rapid
growth in transnational crime such as drug trafficking, money laundering and
fraud. At present it has 130 organizational members and some 1,400 individual
members representing more than 130 countries.</P>
      <P>Due to China's  obstruction,  Taiwan  had previously  been represented in IAP
meetings and activities by public prosecutors who are individual members.</P>
      <P>Despite that setback,  Taiwan has persistently  pushed for organizational
membership over the years by filing applications via organizations like the
Prosecutors Association, Republic of China (Taiwan) and the Public Prosecutors
Office for the Taiwan High Court, MOJ officials said.</P>
      <P>In  February,  Taiwan's  application  to join  IAP  as an organizational member
was included on the agenda of an IAP Executive Committee meeting.</P>
      <P>Chang Chun-hui, a chief public prosecutor with the Taoyuan District Prosecutors
Office, along with several MOJ officials, attended the IAP 2009 annual meeting
held in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev Sept. 6-10.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Chang was conferred by the IAP with a special achievement
award for his long-term efforts in cracking down on human trafficking.</P>
      <P>Members of the IAP Executive Committee told Chang and his colleagues at that
time that Taiwan's prosecution system, with high-caliber public prosecutors, was
established well enough to assume the responsibility of mutual judicial
assistance, according to MOJ officials.</P>
      <P>The IAP Executive Committee also told the Taiwanese delegates that China had
expressed hope that the title Taiwan was using in its application -- the
Prosecutors Association, ROC (Taiwan) -- could be changed.</P>

effects had reduced significantly, according to CWB forecaster Luo Ya-yin.</P>
      <P>Although showers were still expected in northeastern and northern Taiwan due to
the northeast monsoon, the rainfall intensity and rainfall duration would
decrease drastically, Luo said, adding that central and southern regions would
see clear skies.</P>
      <P>Northeastern  and northern regions could experience  cooler weather, with
temperatures ranging from 22-26 degrees Celsius, he said.</P>
      <P>The CWB retained its warnings for high tides and strong winds on the northern

      <P>With temperatures getting cooler, large flocks of migrating birds have been seen
flying over the Dongsha Marine National Park in the South China Sea, with 11
bird species having been documented there for the first time, officials said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Conservation officials from the Marine National Park Headquarters and wildlife
experts from the Kaohsiung City Wild Bird Society conducted a field survey on
the Dongsha atoll earlier this month.</P>
      <P>An official from the Ministry of the Interior's Construction and Planning Agency
(CPA) , which is in charge of national park affairs, said the 11 species spotted
for the first time included merlin, migratory quail, crested tern, plaintive
cuckoo, Indian cuckoo, citrine wagtail, short-tailed bush warbler,  Gray's
grasshopper warbler, red-breasted flycatcher, paradise flycatcher and common
rosefinch.</P>
      <P>"These new additions have brought to 215 the number of bird species ever sighted
and documented in the Dongsha Marine National Park," said a CPA official.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of autumn, the official said, a large number of migratory
birds have passed or stopped over in the Dongsha Islands, including many
endangered or protected species, such as Chinese goshawk, hair-crested drongo,
chestnut-winged cuckoo, Indian cuckoo and ruddy kingfisher.</P>
      <P>"The marine national park will continue stepping up conservation efforts and
educational publicity to make the park a new wintering paradise for migratory
birds," the official added.</P>
      <P>Located 444 km southwest of the southern port city of Kaohsiung, the Dongsha
Islands, also known as the Pratas Islands, comprise Dongsha Island and two coral
reefs.</P>
      <P>The government made the area a marine national park in October 2007 as part of
its efforts to better protect its rich marine resources and biodiversity. The
park covers atolls and surrounding waters, with a total acreage of more than
350,000 hectares.</P>
      <P>A national monument was erected on Dongsha Island June 30, 1989, as well as an
adjacent structure to protect the monument May 18, 1993, to assert its
sovereignty over the archipelago.</P>
      <P>With an area three times that of Taipei City, the archipelago boasts the largest
and most unspoiled group of atolls in the West Pacific.</P>
      <P>The reefs surrounding the islands are also the best in Taiwan's territorial
waters. Dongsha's coastal waters are known for their biodiversity, with 489 fish
species and about 200 kinds of coral documented, as well as numerous other
marine species.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) is scheduled to hold a by-election Nov. 14 for
members of its Central Standing Committee (CSC) , as almost all elected members
of the body have decided to resign, a party official in charge of election
affairs said Sunday.</P>
      <P>As of Sunday, the number of CSC members who had resigned or had expressed the
desire to resign had increased to 29 amid criticism that the election for seats
on the party's decision-making body was marred by rampant bribery, according to
the official.</P>
      <P>The KMT revoked the elected status of Yang Chi-hsiung and Chiang Da-lung Oct. 20
for giving gifts to party delegates to solicit for votes.</P>
      <P>Outspoken Legislator Chiu Yi then took the initiative to tender his resignation
to express his displeasure over what he called the bad precedent set by the
just-concluded CSC election, in which many other hopefuls were also accused of
hosting banquets or distributing gifts for votes.</P>
      <P>The mass of resignations came after President Ma Ying-jeou, who doubles as KMT
chairman, voiced support Oct. 23 for the resignation of CSC members to regain
the integrity of the decision-making body.</P>
      <P>The official confirmed that KMT Taipei City Councilor Li Keng Kuei-fang and KMT
Legislator Lee Chuan-chiao, who had previously refused to resign, had said they
would offer their resignations at a provisional CSC meeting slated for the
following day.</P>
      <P>Taipei County Council Speaker Chen Hsin-ching was the only one to stay firm in
keeping his seat, a move apparently to prove his innocence.</P>
      <P>The official also said that in an effort to improve election procedures and stem
further incidents of vote buying, the KMT is considering shortening the polling
time from eight hours to four hours and counting all the votes at a designated
center.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier denies vacillating on U.S. beef import policy</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 25 (CNA)
10/25/09  19:37:34
(By Lin Heng-li, Yang Su-min, Chen Li-ting and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Sunday that the government has not vacillated on its
policy toward U.S. beef imports and will ensure that the new market opening
measures will not adversely impact local cattle raisers.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks amid ferocious criticism from opponents about the
government's decision to allow the entry of U.S. bone-in beef, ground beef, some
offal and processed beef from cattle younger than 30 months and that have not
been contaminated with "specific risk materials."</P>
      <P>During  an  inspection  tour  of  a  post-Typhoon  Morakot reconstruction site
in central Taiwan's Nantou County, Wu said the government has consistently
factored in public health and the interests of local cattle raisers in its
negotiations with the United States on beef trade issues.</P>
      <P>In addition to following World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) regulations
in deleting tonsils and the distal ileum of the small intestine from cattle of
all ages from the permitted import list, Wu said the government has further
imposed an import ban on brains, spinal cords, eyes and skulls.</P>
      <P>"One of our top guidelines in U.S. beef trade negotiations has been that we will
not relax restrictions beyond what have been applied in the U.S. proper, the
European Union, Canada and South Korea, " Wu argued, adding that the government
has not budged from this stance in the whole process.</P>
      <P>Asked about his views on a plan by Yunlin County cattle farmers to stage a
protest  at the Executive  Yuan against  the new market-opening measures, Wu
said he respects their right to express their opinions.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he pointed out, locally produced beef only accounts for about 7
percent of annual domestic beef consumption, far lower than South Korea's 30
percent.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the premier went on, the government's decision to allow
imports of U.S. bone-in beef should have even less of an impact on local cattle
farmers than that experienced by their South Korean counterparts.</P>
      <P>Wu further said the government will adopt measures to help tide local cattle
farmers over the challenges they might encounter after U.S. bone-in beef is
allowed to enter the local market next month.</P>
      <P>The premier also took advantage of the occasion to clarify reports that he said
during his tenure as a legislator that a decision to open the domestic market to
U.S. bone-in beef should be approved by the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>"What I said at the time was that the executive branch should consult with the
legislature before coming up with a decision on the beef trade," Wu argued.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) announced Oct. 23 that Taiwan would expand market
access for U.S. beef after officials of the two countries clinched an accord the
previous day in Washington, D.C. to lift a partial ban on U.S. beef imports.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the new accord, U.S. bone-in beef, ground beef, intestines,
brains, spinal cords and processed beef from cattle younger than 30 months and
that have not been contaminated with "specific risk materials" will be allowed
to enter Taiwan starting Nov. 10.</P>
      <P>Specific risk materials are defined in the protocol as the brain, skull, eyes,
trigeminal ganglia, spinal cord, vertebral column and dorsal root ganglia from
cattle 30 months of age and older, or tonsils and the distal ileum of the small
intestine from cattle of all ages.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan only allows imports of U.S. boneless beef from cattle younger
than 30 months that contain no specified risk materials.</P>
      <P>The new market opening decision has since drawn flak from opposition parties and
consumer rights activists.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party spokesman Tsai Chi-chang said Sunday
that President Ma Ying-jeou should be held accountable for the decision.</P>
      <P>Citing a newspaper report, Tsai said it was Ma who made the decision under
strong U.S. pressure to allow the expanded imports.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, Ma owes the public a detailed explanation of the reasons behind his
decision," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu Jia-cheng, secretary-general of the non-government Consumers
Foundation, said the decision will inflict permanent harm on Taiwan's
environment and public health.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he went on, the government has not been transparent in its decision-
making process.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the Presidential Office and the National Security Council had
interfered with the DOH's professional judgment about the issue, Wu said this
has violated the norms of a democratic country.</P>
      <P>Wu said the Consumers Foundation is planning to collaborate with other civic
groups in pushing the government to back off on its new market-opening stance in
order to better protect public health.</P>
      <P>Chen Shun-sheng, a Chang Gung University professor, said the government should
seek to add a provision to the newly signed beef trade accord that will demand
that the U.S. Department of Agriculture must offer damages or compensation if
its Quality System Assessment certificates are proved to be untruthful or wrong.</P>

      <P>China is ready for trade talks with Taiwan and may broach the issue in
forthcoming cross-Taiwan Strait talks later this year, Beijing's chief official
in charge of Taiwan affairs said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Wang Yi, chief of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said Beijing
hopes the two sides can exchange views on the issue in the fourth round of talks
between China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and
Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , the two intermediary bodies in the
absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks at a seminar sponsored jointly by the Taipei-based Chung-
Hua Institution for Economic Research and a think tank under the Taiwan Affairs
Office.</P>
      <P>"We are willing to negotiate with Taiwan on a trade pact and suggest the
completion of studies by experts from both sides, " he said.</P>
      <P>The seminar has drawn senior economic officials from Taiwan, including Deputy
Economic Minister Hwang Jung-chiou, and Council for Economic Planning and
Development Vice Minister San Gee.</P>
      <P>ARATS President Chen Yun-lin and SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung are slated to meet
in the central Taiwan city of Taichung on an as-yet unspecified date in December
for the fourth round of cross-strait negotiations.</P>
      <P>The trade pact,  called an economic cooperation  framework agreement, is
designed to promote trade and economic cooperation between the two sides and the
Taiwanese side hopes it will be concluded early next year.</P>
      <P>It has stirred up controversy in Taiwan as its opponents are worried that the
pact will undermine the country's sovereignty despite President Ma Ying-jeou's
repeated assurances that it will not change the status quo across the strait in
any way.</P>

      <P>The Taipei city government hosted an Indonesian culture festival at Daan Forest
Park Sunday to honor migrant workers and new immigrants from Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of Indonesian workers, caregivers and spouses of local citizens decked
out in folk costumes or stylish outfits attended the event held in the city's
largest park.</P>
      <P>Famous Indonesian pop signer Rossa and several Indonesian rock bands performed
at the event to make the participants feel at home, said Tsai Pei-chen, head of
the Foreign Workers Consultation Service Center under the city's Bureau of Labor
Affairs.</P>
      <P>The Indonesian pop vocalists also led the audience in performing traditional
Indonesian dances "Barong" and "Poco-Poco."</P>
      <P>Su Yin-guei, director of the city's Bureau of Labor Affairs, took part in a skit

      <P>Taiwan will negotiate with China on the signing of a comprehensive trade
agreement in a gradual manner, Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>He was responding to remarks made by China's top official in charge of Taiwan
affairs earlier the same day that Beijing is ready for talks with Taiwan on the
signing of an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA), similar to a free
trade agreement (FTA).</P>
      <P>Wang Yi, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of China's State Council of
Cabinet, said at a an economic seminar held in Chengdu in southwestern China,
that Beijing hopes the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can begin ECFA-related
talks within this year.</P>
      <P>If both sides agree, Wang Yi said, the two sides can exchange views on relevant
issues at the fourth rounds of high-level talks between the two intermediary
bodies scheduled for December.</P>
      <P>Wang Yi's statement marked the first official response from Chinese authorities
to Taiwan's recent call for striking the ECFA deal as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In the first official comment on Wang Yi's statement, Wang Yu-chi said Taiwan
will conduct ECFA-related talks with China at a pace as planned.</P>
      <P>He also cited President Ma Ying-jeou's speech delivered Sunday at a ceremony
commemorating the 60th anniversary of the Battle of Kuningtou -- in which
Kuomintang troops repulsed an attempted invasion by Chinese communist forces of
Kinmen in 1949 -- to signify Taiwan's stance on cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>"Just like what President Ma said today in Kinmen that the Taiwan Strait should
turn from a 'killing field' into a 'peace square, ' we look forward to seeing
the two sides of Taiwan Strait resolve their issues or disputes through peaceful
dialogue and negotiations, " said Wang Yu-chi.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Wang Yi's remarks, Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Liu Te-
shun said the timing for formal launch of ECFA talks will depend on the results
of informal talks between the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) and China's
Ministry of Commerce.</P>
      <P>Officials from both sides have held three rounds of informal talks and a fourth
round of informal talks is scheduled to take place later this month.</P>
      <P>If all goes smooth, MOEA officials said recently, formal talks on the much-
anticipated ECFA deal may get underway soon.</P>
      <P>When Taiwan's top negotiator with China -- Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman
Chiang Pin-kun --  meets with his Chinese counterpart, Chen Yunlin, president of
Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, in Taichung in
December, ECFA issues are expected to be formally discussed following Wang Yi's
Sunday statement.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government has argued that an ECFA agreement with China should be
signed as soon as possible to reduce the impact on Taiwanese businesses once
economic integration of China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) comes into force next year.</P>
      <P>After the China-ASEAN free trade agreement takes effect on Jan. 1, 2010,
petrochemical products, textiles, automobile parts and machinery exports from
ASEAN states to China will enjoy tariff-free treatment, which government
officials said will seriously undermine the competitiveness of similar products
from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But critics said signing an ECFA pact with China could hurt some of Taiwan's
labor-intensive industries and even make Taiwan more reliant on China
economically.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou vowed Sunday on the Taiwan-held island of Kinmen to
dissolve "the hatred" across the Taiwan Strait with the greatest sincerity so as
to sweep killing into history and secure eternal peace between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Addressing a ceremony to mark the 60th anniversary of the Battle of Kuningtou --
in which Kuomintang troops repulsed an attempted invasion by Chinese communist
forces of Kinmen in 1949 -- Ma said the battle rewrote modern Chinese history
and ushered in an era in which Taiwan and China are separate and ruled by
different governments.</P>
      <P>The battle occurred soon after the ROC government relocated its seat from China
to Taiwan after being defeated in the Chinese civil war in early 1949.</P>
      <P>Some 10,000 Chinese communist troops made shore on Kinmen's Kuningtou beach on
the night of Oct. 25, 1949 for a surprise attack, sparking a bitter conflict
that lasted for three days. Some 7,000 People's Liberation Army soldiers were
taken prisoner and around 3,000 were killed, while 1,200 ROC troops died.</P>
      <P>"We should offer our gratitude to the ROC soldiers who sacrificed their lives in
the battle to give Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu 60 years to develop in
peace," Ma said.</P>
      <P>He said the Battle of Kuningtou could easily be forgotten in comparison to other
much more turbulent periods since the early 20th Century, when millions of
people were killed in the Warlord Era, followed by the anti-Japanese war and the
ensuing rise of the Chinese communists, but the battle represents an important
and crucial page in modern Chinese history, as it changed the fate of both
Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>It marked a watershed in modern Chinese history, as it allowed two political and
economic entities with different ideologies to begin their differing experiments
on either side of the Taiwan Strait, he continued.</P>
      <P>Over the past 60 years, he went on, Taiwan first strived to exist in the
conflict  between  the  two facets  of democracy  and totalitarianism, and then
endeavored to develop itself into a democratic economy amid competition among
the United States, Japan and China.</P>
      <P>By comparison, he noted,  China has experienced a totally different 60 years,
with the first three decades witnessing the most turbulent, distressing era in
which many millions of people died, families were broken and societal core
values collapsed.</P>
      <P>"China experienced more trying, untold sufferings than Taiwan did in that
period," he said.</P>
      <P>However, in the most recent 30 years, China has continued conducting social and
economic reforms via its unique "socialism with Chinese characteristics, "
eventually leading to China's rise on the world stage, he said.</P>
      <P>The president traveled to Kinmen to attend the ceremony in the company of
Minister of National Defense Kao Hua-chu, National Security Council Secretary-
General Su Chi and other high-ranking officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan formally enters international prosecutors organization</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   25  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has recently  joined  the International Association of Prosecutors (IAP)
, the only global non-government organization of prosecutors, under the title of
Chinese Taipei, the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>After twists and turns regarding its title, Taiwan was finally notified by IAP
Secretary-General Henk Marquart Scholtz Oct. 20 that it had been admitted into
the body as an organizational member under the name Chinese Taipei, the MOJ
said.</P>
      <P>The membership will allow Taiwan's MOJ and public prosecutors to share with
other IAP members resources related to mutual judicial assistance and to host
international IAP meetings.</P>
      <P>The IAP was established by the United Nations in 1995 in Vienna due to rapid
growth in transnational crime such as drug trafficking, money laundering and
fraud. At present it has 130 organizational members and some 1,400 individual
members representing more than 130 countries.</P>
      <P>Due to China's  obstruction,  Taiwan  had previously  been represented in IAP
meetings and activities by public prosecutors who are individual members.</P>
      <P>Despite that setback,  Taiwan has persistently  pushed for organizational
membership over the years by filing applications via organizations like the
Prosecutors Association, Republic of China (Taiwan) and the Public Prosecutors
Office for the Taiwan High Court, MOJ officials said.</P>
      <P>In  February,  Taiwan's  application  to join  IAP  as an organizational member
was included on the agenda of an IAP Executive Committee meeting.</P>
      <P>Chang Chun-hui, a chief public prosecutor with the Taoyuan District Prosecutors
Office, along with several MOJ officials, attended the IAP 2009 annual meeting
held in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev Sept. 6-10.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Chang was conferred by the IAP with a special achievement
award for his long-term efforts in cracking down on human trafficking.</P>
      <P>Members of the IAP Executive Committee told Chang and his colleagues at that
time that Taiwan's prosecution system, with high-caliber public prosecutors, was
established well enough to assume the responsibility of mutual judicial
assistance, according to MOJ officials.</P>
      <P>The IAP Executive Committee also told the Taiwanese delegates that China had
expressed hope that the title Taiwan was using in its application -- the
Prosecutors Association, ROC (Taiwan) -- could be changed.</P>

      <P>Seven government-led urban regeneration projects slated to be launched next year
are expected to attract private investment of about NT$61.4 billion (US$1.89

      <P>With temperatures getting cooler, large flocks of migrating birds have been seen
flying over the Dongsha Marine National Park in the South China Sea, with 11
bird species having been documented there for the first time, officials said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Conservation officials from the Marine National Park Headquarters and wildlife
experts from the Kaohsiung City Wild Bird Society conducted a field survey on
the Dongsha atoll earlier this month.</P>
      <P>An official from the Ministry of the Interior's Construction and Planning Agency
(CPA) , which is in charge of national park affairs, said the 11 species spotted
for the first time included merlin, migratory quail, crested tern, plaintive
cuckoo, Indian cuckoo, citrine wagtail, short-tailed bush warbler,  Gray's
grasshopper warbler, red-breasted flycatcher, paradise flycatcher and common
rosefinch.</P>
      <P>"These new additions have brought to 215 the number of bird species ever sighted
and documented in the Dongsha Marine National Park," said a CPA official.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of autumn, the official said, a large number of migratory
birds have passed or stopped over in the Dongsha Islands, including many
endangered or protected species, such as Chinese goshawk, hair-crested drongo,
chestnut-winged cuckoo, Indian cuckoo and ruddy kingfisher.</P>
      <P>"The marine national park will continue stepping up conservation efforts and
educational publicity to make the park a new wintering paradise for migratory
birds," the official added.</P>
      <P>Located 444 km southwest of the southern port city of Kaohsiung, the Dongsha
Islands, also known as the Pratas Islands, comprise Dongsha Island and two coral
reefs.</P>
      <P>The government made the area a marine national park in October 2007 as part of
its efforts to better protect its rich marine resources and biodiversity. The
park covers atolls and surrounding waters, with a total acreage of more than
350,000 hectares.</P>
      <P>A national monument was erected on Dongsha Island June 30, 1989, as well as an
adjacent structure to protect the monument May 18, 1993, to assert its
sovereignty over the archipelago.</P>
      <P>With an area three times that of Taipei City, the archipelago boasts the largest
and most unspoiled group of atolls in the West Pacific.</P>
      <P>The reefs surrounding the islands are also the best in Taiwan's territorial
waters. Dongsha's coastal waters are known for their biodiversity, with 489 fish
species and about 200 kinds of coral documented, as well as numerous other
marine species.</P>

      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) is scheduled to hold a by-election Nov. 14 for
members of its Central Standing Committee (CSC) , as almost all elected members
of the body have decided to resign, a party official in charge of election
affairs said Sunday.</P>
      <P>As of Sunday, the number of CSC members who had resigned or had expressed the
desire to resign had increased to 29 amid criticism that the election for seats
on the party's decision-making body was marred by rampant bribery, according to
the official.</P>
      <P>The KMT revoked the elected status of Yang Chi-hsiung and Chiang Da-lung Oct. 20
for giving gifts to party delegates to solicit for votes.</P>
      <P>Outspoken Legislator Chiu Yi then took the initiative to tender his resignation
to express his displeasure over what he called the bad precedent set by the
just-concluded CSC election, in which many other hopefuls were also accused of
hosting banquets or distributing gifts for votes.</P>
      <P>The mass of resignations came after President Ma Ying-jeou, who doubles as KMT
chairman, voiced support Oct. 23 for the resignation of CSC members to regain
the integrity of the decision-making body.</P>
      <P>The official confirmed that KMT Taipei City Councilor Li Keng Kuei-fang and KMT
Legislator Lee Chuan-chiao, who had previously refused to resign, had said they
would offer their resignations at a provisional CSC meeting slated for the
following day.</P>
      <P>Taipei County Council Speaker Chen Hsin-ching was the only one to stay firm in
keeping his seat, a move apparently to prove his innocence.</P>
      <P>The official also said that in an effort to improve election procedures and stem
further incidents of vote buying, the KMT is considering shortening the polling
time from eight hours to four hours and counting all the votes at a designated
center.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier denies vacillating on U.S. beef import policy</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 25 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Sunday that the government has not vacillated on its
policy toward U.S. beef imports and will ensure that the new market opening
measures will not adversely impact local cattle raisers.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks amid ferocious criticism from opponents about the
government's decision to allow the entry of U.S. bone-in beef, ground beef, some
offal and processed beef from cattle younger than 30 months and that have not
been contaminated with "specific risk materials."</P>
      <P>During  an  inspection  tour  of  a  post-Typhoon  Morakot reconstruction site
in central Taiwan's Nantou County, Wu said the government has consistently
factored in public health and the interests of local cattle raisers in its
negotiations with the United States on beef trade issues.</P>
      <P>In addition to following World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) regulations
in deleting tonsils and the distal ileum of the small intestine from cattle of
all ages from the permitted import list, Wu said the government has further
imposed an import ban on brains, spinal cords, eyes and skulls.</P>
      <P>"One of our top guidelines in U.S. beef trade negotiations has been that we will
not relax restrictions beyond what have been applied in the U.S. proper, the
European Union, Canada and South Korea, " Wu argued, adding that the government
has not budged from this stance in the whole process.</P>
      <P>Asked about his views on a plan by Yunlin County cattle farmers to stage a
protest  at the Executive  Yuan against  the new market-opening measures, Wu
said he respects their right to express their opinions.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he pointed out, locally produced beef only accounts for about 7
percent of annual domestic beef consumption, far lower than South Korea's 30
percent.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the premier went on, the government's decision to allow
imports of U.S. bone-in beef should have even less of an impact on local cattle
farmers than that experienced by their South Korean counterparts.</P>
      <P>Wu further said the government will adopt measures to help tide local cattle
farmers over the challenges they might encounter after U.S. bone-in beef is
allowed to enter the local market next month.</P>
      <P>The premier also took advantage of the occasion to clarify reports that he said
during his tenure as a legislator that a decision to open the domestic market to
U.S. bone-in beef should be approved by the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>"What I said at the time was that the executive branch should consult with the
legislature before coming up with a decision on the beef trade," Wu argued.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) announced Oct. 23 that Taiwan would expand market
access for U.S. beef after officials of the two countries clinched an accord the
previous day in Washington, D.C. to lift a partial ban on U.S. beef imports.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the new accord, U.S. bone-in beef, ground beef, intestines,
brains, spinal cords and processed beef from cattle younger than 30 months and
that have not been contaminated with "specific risk materials" will be allowed
to enter Taiwan starting Nov. 10.</P>
      <P>Specific risk materials are defined in the protocol as the brain, skull, eyes,
trigeminal ganglia, spinal cord, vertebral column and dorsal root ganglia from
cattle 30 months of age and older, or tonsils and the distal ileum of the small
intestine from cattle of all ages.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan only allows imports of U.S. boneless beef from cattle younger
than 30 months that contain no specified risk materials.</P>
      <P>The new market opening decision has since drawn flak from opposition parties and
consumer rights activists.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party spokesman Tsai Chi-chang said Sunday
that President Ma Ying-jeou should be held accountable for the decision.</P>
      <P>Citing a newspaper report, Tsai said it was Ma who made the decision under
strong U.S. pressure to allow the expanded imports.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, Ma owes the public a detailed explanation of the reasons behind his
decision," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu Jia-cheng, secretary-general of the non-government Consumers
Foundation, said the decision will inflict permanent harm on Taiwan's
environment and public health.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he went on, the government has not been transparent in its decision-
making process.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the Presidential Office and the National Security Council had
interfered with the DOH's professional judgment about the issue, Wu said this
has violated the norms of a democratic country.</P>
      <P>Wu said the Consumers Foundation is planning to collaborate with other civic
groups in pushing the government to back off on its new market-opening stance in
order to better protect public health.</P>
      <P>Chen Shun-sheng, a Chang Gung University professor, said the government should
seek to add a provision to the newly signed beef trade accord that will demand
that the U.S. Department of Agriculture must offer damages or compensation if
its Quality System Assessment certificates are proved to be untruthful or wrong.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will negotiate with China on the signing of a comprehensive trade
agreement in a gradual manner, Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>He was responding to remarks made by China's top official in charge of Taiwan
affairs earlier the same day that Beijing is ready for talks with Taiwan on the
signing of an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA), similar to a free
trade agreement (FTA).</P>
      <P>Wang Yi, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of China's State Council of
Cabinet, said at a an economic seminar held in Chengdu in southwestern China,
that Beijing hopes the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can begin ECFA-related
talks within this year.</P>
      <P>If both sides agree, Wang Yi said, the two sides can exchange views on relevant
issues at the fourth rounds of high-level talks between the two intermediary
bodies scheduled for December.</P>
      <P>Wang Yi's statement marked the first official response from Chinese authorities
to Taiwan's recent call for striking the ECFA deal as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In the first official comment on Wang Yi's statement, Wang Yu-chi said Taiwan
will conduct ECFA-related talks with China at a pace as planned.</P>
      <P>He also cited President Ma Ying-jeou's speech delivered Sunday at a ceremony
commemorating the 60th anniversary of the Battle of Kuningtou -- in which
Kuomintang troops repulsed an attempted invasion by Chinese communist forces of
Kinmen in 1949 -- to signify Taiwan's stance on cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>"Just like what President Ma said today in Kinmen that the Taiwan Strait should
turn from a 'killing field' into a 'peace square, ' we look forward to seeing
the two sides of Taiwan Strait resolve their issues or disputes through peaceful
dialogue and negotiations, " said Wang Yu-chi.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Wang Yi's remarks, Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Liu Te-
shun said the timing for formal launch of ECFA talks will depend on the results
of informal talks between the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) and China's
Ministry of Commerce.</P>
      <P>Officials from both sides have held three rounds of informal talks and a fourth
round of informal talks is scheduled to take place later this month.</P>
      <P>If all goes smooth, MOEA officials said recently, formal talks on the much-
anticipated ECFA deal may get underway soon.</P>
      <P>When Taiwan's top negotiator with China -- Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman
Chiang Pin-kun --  meets with his Chinese counterpart, Chen Yunlin, president of
Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, in Taichung in
December, ECFA issues are expected to be formally discussed following Wang Yi's
Sunday statement.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government has argued that an ECFA agreement with China should be
signed as soon as possible to reduce the impact on Taiwanese businesses once
economic integration of China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) comes into force next year.</P>
      <P>After the China-ASEAN free trade agreement takes effect on Jan. 1, 2010,
petrochemical products, textiles, automobile parts and machinery exports from
ASEAN states to China will enjoy tariff-free treatment, which government
officials said will seriously undermine the competitiveness of similar products
from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But critics said signing an ECFA pact with China could hurt some of Taiwan's
labor-intensive industries and even make Taiwan more reliant on China
economically.</P>

      <P>A group of 70 heavyweights from China's business, industrial and academic
sectors are due to arrive in Taiwan Monday for a cross-strait conference on the
retail and logistics service industries, according to a Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) source.</P>
      <P>Prominent figures among the mainland Chinese delegates are expected to include
Liang Chunxiao, vice president of Alibaba.com. -- the world's largest online
consumers marketplace -- and executives from Guo Mei Appliance  Company which is
China's 3C business locomotive, according to an official from the MOEA
Department of Industrial Technology.</P>
      <P>Other heavyweights on the Chinese delegation will include heads of several
national logistics service industry associations in China and executives from
the five largest retail franchise groups in Shanghai, including Lianhua Quickly
Mall and Hualian Lawson.</P>
      <P>Chi Lihua, deputy director of Shanghai Business School's Chain Management
Institute, and Li Xu,  deputy director of Tsinghua University's Institute for
Internet Behavior, are also expected to attend, according Ruida Global
Marketing, the commissioned organizer of the conference.</P>
      <P>The two-day cross-strait logistics service industry conference, which will open
at Grand Hotel in Taipei Tuesday, is one of the programs under the "Bridge-
Building Project" devised by the MOEA Department of Industrial Technology to
bolster industrial exchanges and cooperation across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>On the Taiwan side, more than 200 delegates are expected to take part in the
conference, with prominent figures including Chang Ping-chao, chairman of the
General Chamber of Commerce of the ROC, President Chain Store Corp. Managing
Director Hsu Chung-jen and PC Home Online Chairman Chan Hung-chi, being keynote
speakers, according to Ruida.</P>
      <P>With a view to implementing President Ma Ying-jeou's policies of "launching a
new era of cross-strait economic and trade negotiation" and "promoting Taiwan's
interests and advancing global connections, " the MOEA devised the "Bridge-
Building Project" in 2008 and it was approved by the Executive Yuan in August
that year.</P>
      <P>The goal of the project is to set up exchange platforms for each industry and to
hold a series of cross-strait conferences on exchanges in individual industries
as a way of building bridges between the two sides, the MOEA Department of
Industrial Technology said.</P>
      <P>The value of Taiwan's logistics service industry was 27 percent of the country's
gross domestic product (GDP) in 2008 and is expected to top NT$1.5 trillion
(US$46.3 billion) this year, according to the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 1,500 volunteers mobilized by environmental protection groups assembled in
Changhua County Sunday, forming the shape of a Chinese white dolphin, to call
for the scrapping of a plan to build a petrochemical plant on the county's
southwestern coast.</P>
      <P>The project has been proposed  by Kuo Kuang Petrochemical Technology Co., an
incorporated joint venture between the state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp. and six
other Taiwanese companies.</P>
      <P>The volunteers, from schools and various environmental groups led by the
Changhua Environmental Protection Alliance, gathered at Putien Temple in the
central county and some of them formed the shape of a Chinese white dolphin.</P>
      <P>Other members of the groups, holding red, white and black open umbrellas, formed
the letters S.O.S. to symbolize that the dolphins are in danger of extinction
and there is critical need to protect the habitats of the species.</P>
      <P>Led by Taiwan Environmental Protection Union President Wang Chin-shou, the
volunteers read a statement vowing to protect the Changhua coast, reject the
entry of high energy consumption and high pollution industries into the county,
and protect the sustainability of local farming  and fishery  industries  and
the ecological environment.</P>
      <P>The Chinese white dolphin lives mainly in the waters along Taiwan's western
coast but its population has been dwindling and there only about 70 left in the
area, Wang said.</P>
      <P>If Kuo Kuang's plan to set up a plant on the Changhua coast materializes, it
could result in the extinction of the Chinese white dolphin and damage to the
marine ecology, Wang added.</P>
      <P>To protect the survival rights of the endangered dolphin species, several
conservation groups will file a lawsuit against the Changhua County government
and Kuo Kuang Co., demanding that they halt the plans for the petrochemical
business in the area, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Penghu to make Hujing Taiwan's first low-carbon island</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 26 (CNA)
10/26/09  16:15:38
(By Kao Mao-hsiung and Fanny Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The offshore county of Penghu has decided to make the county's Hujing Island the
nation's first low-carbon island  by  promoting  electric  motorcycles,
offering  free battery-charging services, county officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>Penghu County has long been planning to develop a low-carbon environment, with
Hujing identified as the best place to become the first island using only
electric motorcycles, as it is relatively small, said Yeh Kuo-ching, director-
general of Penghu County's Economic Affairs Bureau.</P>
      <P>The short range of the vehicles before recharging is required and the dearth of
recharging stations are two major problems in promoting electric motorcycles,
local officials said. However, these will not be a problem on Hujing.</P>
      <P>Yeh noted that a fully charged electric motorcycle can run for up to 50
kilometers.</P>
      <P>"You could ride an electric scooter around the entire island more than 10 times,
" Yeh added. He did not mention a specific timetable for the implementation of
the plan.</P>
      <P>Hujing Island is located seven nautical miles off the coast of the county seat
of Magong City. With an area of just 2.133 square kilometers,  it is the
seventh-largest  island  in the Penghu archipelago and is most famous for its
distinctive basalt rock formations.</P>
      <P>It has a permanent population of around 400, and around 75 percent of its 160
motorcycles are rental machines for visiting tourists, according to borough
chief Chen Da-chuan.</P>
      <P>Chen cited the results of a recent survey showing that up to 68 percent of
Hujing's residents would be willing to replace their gasoline-powered
motorcycles with electric ones.</P>
      <P>"We hope the government can provide more subsidies for purchasing new electric
motorcycles," Chen added.</P>
      <P>After a casino construction proposal was defeated by Penghu's residents in a
referendum last month, Penghu Magistrate Wang Chien-fa turned to the possibility
of developing along the path of green energy, making Penghu a low-carbon county.</P>
      <P>His plan echoed remarks by former Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, who said in July that
the government will launch a "low-carbon community" that will involve the
selection of an outlying island that will become a model for a low-carbon
lifestyle, with at least 50 percent of the electricity on the island supplied
from renewable sources.</P>

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Monday:</P>
      <P>Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>Strengthening military to mark Kuningtou Battle</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has vowed to turn Kinmen from a killing field into a
peace square, during activities to mark the 60th anniversary of the Kuningtou
Battle.</P>
      <P>But this is not a goal that can be achieved unilaterally, as it requires
cooperation from the other side.</P>
      <P>Ma is right to replace war with peace, but Taiwan's victory in the Battle of
Kuningtou demonstrated that only a powerful military can repel invaders and
safeguard peace.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Time's up, TMC project should be scrapped</P>
      <P>Applications for assistance under the economic ministry's DRAM industry
reorganization project have closed and it seems that only Taiwan Memory Corp.
will be eligible for subsidization under the program.</P>
      <P>However, we have to point out that the crisis in the DRAM industry, which was
caused by the global financial meltdown, is almost over, and there is no longer
need for government intervention to help the industry recover.</P>
      <P>The project to offer billions in aid to a specific industry at the discretion of
the government is riddled with legal controversies and is doomed to fail. It
should therefore be scrapped.</P>
      <P>Officials who ignore this warning and go ahead with the project could end up
facing probes by the Control Yuan or prosecutors on the suspicion  of
inappropriately  steering  profits  to  specific businessmen.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>How can the Ma administration rely on China's false economic</P>
      <P>growth?</P>
      <P>China, which is struggling to maintain 8 percent economic growth this year,
claimed that its economy expanded by 8.9 precent in the third quarter.</P>
      <P>We doubt the accuracy of that figure, as China is known for cooking the books to
support political forecasts.</P>
      <P>Gordon Chang, a U.S. lawyer and author of the 2001 book, The Coming Collapse of
China, said in an article in Forbes that China's statistics show three
conflicting phenomena, namely booming sales of consume goods, easy supplies of
money, and deflation.</P>
      <P>The only explanation for this is that the statistics were manipulated.</P>
      <P>We do not deny that there are business opportunities in China for Taiwan
businessmen, but China is far less important than the markets of Europe and the
U.S, and China's economic strength cannot rival the U.S., Europe or Japan's.</P>
      <P>President Ma's policy of allowing the free movement of people and goods between
China and Taiwan is nothing more than a transfusion to China which will result
in the regression of Taiwan's economy and lead to a political dead end.</P>

      <P>The government caused an uproar Friday day when it announced the lifting of a
ban on imports of U.S. bone-in beef.</P>
      <P>The public was astounded by the government's decision for three reasons. First
the lifting of the restrictions on beef produts went to far with the inclusion
of offal, which could expose consumers to mad cow disease. Second, the
department of health was sidelined while the National Security Council pulled
the strings behind the scenes. Third, the government did not do enough to
convince the people to support its decision.</P>
      <P>The only option Taiwan has left with now is to strictly implement the import
rules to ensure that all U.S. beef on the local market is healthy and safe for
consumption.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Grilled by lawmakers of all political persuasion on the results of the recent
U.S.-Taiwan beef talks that led to relaxed import restrictions on U.S. beef,
Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang said Monday that the
government had managed to secure its bottom line on the issue and that the
results were no inferior to those secured by South Korea.</P>
      <P>Although  he admitted  that the results are not the most satisfactory, he
maintained that they are acceptable.</P>
      <P>Legislators from both the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) expressed disapproval during a session at the
Legislative Yuan to the government's decision to allow the entry of U.S. bone-in
beef, ground beef, some offal and processed beef from cattle younger than 30
months and that have not been contaminated with "specific risk materials" from
Nov. 10.</P>
      <P>Yaung said he was disappointed that Taiwan was not able to secure its entire
defense line that would have seen its market open only to bone-in beef from
cattle younger than 30 months, even though the U.S. wanted all beef and beef
products to be allowed access to the Taiwan market.</P>
      <P>The two sides managed to reach consensus on the issue in June, agreeing that
further talks should be resumed based on a South Korean formula, he added.</P>
      <P>The DOH announced Oct. 23 that Taiwan would expand market access for U.S. beef
after officials of the two countries clinched a protocol the previous day in
Washington, D.C. to lift a partial ban on such imports.</P>
      <P>"All negotiations involve concession," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lin Hung-chih said Yaung should step down to take political
responsibility for the new market-opening measures.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Huang Sue-ying said the Taiwanese negotiators, led by DOH Vice
Minister Hsiao Mei-ling, fought a losing battle, pointing out that when Taiwan
agreed in 2006 to open its doors to U.S. boneless beef, it had attached the
proviso that should a single case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or
mad cow disease, occur in the United States, Taiwan would immediately shut its
doors to U.S. beef imports.</P>
      <P>This time around, however, Taiwan made concessions that in addition to bone-in
beef, it will also allow imports of ground beef, intestines, brains, spinal
cords and processed beef from cattle younger than 30 months that have not been
contaminated with "specific risk materials."</P>
      <P>In addition, she went on, under the terms of the new accord, Taiwan cannot stop
importing U.S. beef and beef products even if BSE is reported in America unless
the World Organization for Animal Health declares the United States an affected
area.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Wang Hsin-nan said President Ma Ying-jeou and National Security
Council Secretary-General Su Chi should be held accountable, accusing them of
interfering with the decision-making process.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Council of Agriculture (COA) Minister Chen Wu-hsiung said at another
legislative hearing that he and his family would eat U.S.-imported beef and beef
products, but would not exhort the public to consume it.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lu Shiow-yen questioned Chen as to how the government will be
able to screen the safety of offal if Taiwan traders apply to import brains,
skulls, eyes and spinal cords as there are technical difficulties involved.
"Japan has barred imports of such offal on the grounds that there are technical
difficulties in screening their safety," Lu added.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen said the COA "will make every effort to keep such offal at
bay." He declined to elaborate.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's decision to relax its restrictions against U.S. beef imports has
nothing to do with any attempt to resume trade talks with the United States
under the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) , Vice Premier Eric
Lilun Chu said Monday.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan needs to step forward for the sake of its overall trade," Chu said in
response to questions from the media on the government's recent decision to lift
a ban on U.S. bone-in beef and other controversial beef products.</P>
      <P>Taiwan cannot rely solely on the proposed economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China and must therefore maintain the TIFA with the U.S.,
forge free trade agreements (FTAs) with its neighbors in Southeast Asia, and
seek trade partnership with other countries, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan must promote trade in every possible area, Chu stressed.</P>
      <P>Asked whether or not the government's decision on U.S. beef would be used as a
bargaining chip in its attempt to resume trade talks with Washington under the
TIFA, Chu said "it has nothing to do with the TIFA."</P>
      <P>The TIFA between the U.S. and Taiwan was established in September 1994 to
resolve bilateral  trade issues and enhance  economic cooperation.</P>
      <P>It was also regarded as a stepping stone to an FTA between Taiwan and the U.S.,
and under its framework, meetings were held once or twice a year but were
suspended in July 2007 after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on U.S.
beef imports to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, speaking on the planned ECFA with China, the vice premier said the
issue will be raised in the fourth round of talks between the two sides later
this year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with China, Chairman Chiang Pin-kung of the Straits
Exchanges Foundation (SEF), and his Chinese counterpart, Chen Yunling, president
of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , are
scheduled to meet in Taichung City, central Taiwan later this year for talks on
financial cooperation between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Chu said he could not forecast when the two sides would seal the ECFA because
Taiwan must have the support of the public and the approval of the legislature
before it can sign the agreement.</P>
      <P>Chu promised that the government will stick tightly to its policies such as
maintaining its restrictions on some agricultural products from China, and that
the ECFA will reflect Taiwan's best interests.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan indigenous algae strain rich in DHA content: NCKU</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) research team has discovered an
indigenous algae that is rich in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) , containing 10
times as much of the omega-3 fatty acid as existing DHA supplements such as fish
oil.</P>
      <P>The indigenous DHA-rich algae strain, called BL10, was discovered after the team
isolated, cultivated and identified marine microalgae from 10 marine  habitats
around  Taiwan,  Yang Huey-lang,  a distinguished professor in NCKU's Institute
of Biotechnology.</P>
      <P>"BL10 proved to have the highest DHA yield among all studied algae strains and
could become an excellent source of microbial DHA," Yang said at a news
conference held in Taipei.</P>
      <P>DHA is thought to benefit human health,  particularly  in preventing
cardiovascular  disease,  reducing inflammation  and improving cognitive
functions.</P>
      <P>Chen Yi-min, an assistant professor in the NCKU's Research Center of Ocean
Environment and Technology and one of the managers of the research project, said
that after the BL10 algae is dried into a powder, it has a DHA content of 0.3
grams per gram of powder, a concentration that is 10 times higher than the DHA
found in deep sea fish such as salmon and tuna.</P>
      <P>If the BL10 algae is used to extract an algae oil, the oil's DHA concentration
can reach 50 percent, far higher than the 5 to 10 percent found in deep sea fish
oil, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The BL10 algae also has the advantage of not having the pungent smell of fish,
making it more acceptable to consumers as an additive to yogurt drinks and
infant milk formulas or as a supplement.</P>
      <P>At Monday's news conference, the research team announced that the know-how
related to BL10 has been transferred to local biotech firm Vedan Biotechnology
for commercialization.</P>
      <P>Vedan Biotechnology President Yang Shih-an said the company is expected to start
commercial production or a related product line in two years and hopes to
generate sales of between NT$1 billion and NT$2 billion within three to five
years.</P>

      <P>It will take a while for Chinese investment in Taiwan to bear fruit and the
government will come up with an assessment report later this year, a Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has long allowed its businessmen to invest in many industries in China,
but it did not open its doors to Chinese investment in a limited number of
sectors until June this year.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun said the government has been using the six months
following  the June 30 implementation  of the regulations governing Chinese
investment in Taiwan as a period for publicity, promotion and experimentation.</P>
      <P>"We believe it will take a while for this new market opening policy to come to
fruition or for the effects to become apparent, " Liu said, adding that the MAC
is scheduled to conduct an overall review of the relevant measures late this
year, with the conclusions of the study serving as a basis for further
improvement of government policy toward Chinese investment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks a day after China's top official in charge of Taiwan
affairs urged Taiwan to further liberalize its regulations on investment from
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Wang Yi, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under China's State Council, said
at a seminar on cross-strait relations held in Chengdu in China's Sichuan
Province that China welcomes Taiwan's opening to Chinese investors but hopes
that the scope of the permitted areas for investment can be expanded.</P>
      <P>"We also hope that Taiwan will offer our investors a more fair and more
reasonable business environment and provide our Taiwan-based management
personnel with greater convenience, " Wang said.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released by the Investment Commission under the Ministry
of Economic Affairs, 15 Chinese investment projects totaling NT$190 million
(US$5.9 million) have been approved since the new regulations governing Chinese
investment in Taiwan took effect June 30.</P>

      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun said Monday that if the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait decide the time is right, they can exchange views
on the signing of an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) at a fourth
round of high-level cross-strait talks scheduled for December.</P>
      <P>However, he stressed that the main aim of the next round of talks will be
signing off on four major issues that have already been identified and
discussed.</P>
      <P>Liu said the Ministry of Economic Affairs and relevant Chinese officials have
completed their respective studies on the proposed trade pact and have been
informally exchanging views before entering a stage of joint research  to create
the best platform  for negotiations.</P>
      <P>"If both sides are ready, ECFA discussions will not be ruled out during the
fourth round of cross-strait talks," said Liu.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks after China's top official in charge of Taiwan affairs said
a day earlier that Beijing hopes the two sides can begin ECFA-related talks
within this year.</P>
      <P>Wang Yi, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of China's State Council, said at
an economic seminar in China that if both sides agree, they can exchange views
on ECFA-related issues during the fourth round of cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>Wang's statement marked the first official response from the Chinese authorities
to Taiwan's recent call for striking an ECFA deal as soon as possible. His
remarks suggested that ECFA issues are expected to be formally discussed at the
fourth round of talks.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office, in the first official comment on Wang's remarks, said
Taiwan will conduct ECFA-related talks with China as originally planned.</P>
      <P>The fourth round of talks between Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman
Chiang Pin-kung and his Chinese counterpart Chen Yunlin, president of the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , is
slated to take place in the central Taiwan city of Taichung sometime in the
second half of December.</P>
      <P>According to the SEF -- the semi-official intermediary body founded to deal with
cross-strait exchanges in the absence of official links -- Chiang has been
authorized by the Cabinet- level MAC to talk about four major issues: a safety
check and quality certification system for agricultural products; moves to
prevent double taxation; cooperation on fishery manpower affairs;  and
cooperation on the promotion of standard product quality checking and
certification.</P>
      <P>Chiang mentioned earlier that the signing of an ECFA is expected to take place
during a fifth round of SEF-ARATS talks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Broadband Taiwan 2009 opens with focus on WiMAX</HEADLINE>

      <P>With WiMAX technologies attracting the most attention at Broadband Taiwan 2009,
President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday at the opening of the show that it proves he
made the "right decision" as Taipei mayor to build a WiFLY network that was
later transformed to WiMax.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the opening day of the three-day trade show, Ma said the Taipei City
government began working with Intel Corp. and Taipei-based Chunghwa Telecom Co.
in 2002 to first construct an outdoor wireless communication network in the
upscale Xinyi district, from which the network was expanded to cover an area of
230 square kilometers.</P>
      <P>More than 4,000 access points were eventually established in the 271.8 sq. km.
city to realize his initiative of turning Taiwan's capital into a wireless city,
Ma noted.</P>
      <P>Citing a study which estimated that there will be 700 million WiMAX users
worldwide by 2013, Ma said the assessment shows his policy of building a
wireless city was on the right course.</P>
      <P>Describing his WiMAX experience, Ma said he once used WiMAX on a running metro
train and found that he could surf the Internet as quickly in an environment
moving at high speed as in a static building.</P>
      <P>That advantage, and WiMAX's edge in terms of construction cost and efficiency
relative to other broadband technologies means Taiwan could use WiMAX as the
core technology in developing its service sector.</P>
      <P>Broadband Taiwan 2009 is taking place in conjunction with several international
conferences,  including  the WiMAX Forum  Member Conference, WiMAX Summit Taiwan
2009, the IPTV Development Forum, and the Broadband  Forum  Taiwan  2009,
making  WiMAX  (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) the theme of
the trade show.</P>
      <P>The event, co-organized by the semi-official Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA) and the Taiwan Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers'
Association (TEEMA) ,  is hosting 132 exhibitors at the Taipei World Trade
Center to showcase broadband products ranging from parts and components to
software.</P>
      <P>At the opening ceremony, TAITRA Chairman Wang Chih-kang described 2009 as the
beginning of the WiMAX era in both Taiwan and the world, as businesses around
the globe are gearing up to fight for a share of multibillion US dollar WiMAX
market.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, six local WiMAX operators -- including Tatung InfoComm and Global
Mobil Corp. -- will launch commercial services at the end of this year and next
year.</P>
      <P>According to a report by Taiwan's nongovernmental Institute of Information
Industry, the global production value of WiMAX devices and equipment for users
will reach US$9.33 billion in 2012, and that Taiwan's WiMAX equipment output is
expected to grow by 162-fold between 2006 and 2012 to US$3.78 billion.</P>
      <P>At the trade show, local telecommunication operators introduced many WiMAX
technology applications, including Internet yellow cabs that offer online and
multimedia services.</P>
      <P>WiMAX is a telecommunications technology that provides wireless transmission of
data using a variety of transmission modes, from point-to-multipoint links to
portable and fully mobile internet access</P>

      <P>In an unprecedented move, the Ministry of National Defense (MND) has prepared a
comic-book version of its latest defense White Paper as part of its efforts to
cultivate interest in military service among young readers, an official said
Monday.</P>
      <P>The ministry will host a news conference Tuesday to introduce this new version
of its newly released 2009 National Defense White Paper, the MND official said.</P>
      <P>In addition to expounding on various national defense programs, the official
said, the new comic book will also provide answers to many frequently asked
questions about national defense and military service.</P>
      <P>Two of the leading characters -- an armored vehicle captain and a navy frogwoman
-- featured in the special edition of the defense White Paper will appear at the
news conference, the official said, and they will be joined by the three
cartoonists who worked on the project.</P>
      <P>The official said the publication represented a bold step for the traditionally
staid and conservative ministry to reach out to the younger generation in a
lively, animated style.</P>
      <P>"The new approach is part of our efforts to attract more youngsters to sign up
for military service, as the government is set to establish an all-volunteer
military by 2015," the official said.</P>
      <P>While the ministry's regularly published defense White Papers could be good
material to help students grasp what military service is like, they may be too
difficult, complex and boring for young readers, the official said.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, we have decided to break with tradition and publish a comic-book
version of our defense White Paper, " he said, adding that the traditional form
of the 2009 defense White Paper was released Oct.20.</P>
      <P>The ministry has published 10,000 copies of the comic book, which will mainly
target junior high school students, who tend to be avid fans of the medium. The
comic books will sell for NT$100 (US$3.12) apiece.</P>
      <P>"Through an illustrated  and animated dialogue style,  the comic-book version of
our defense White Paper is expected to inspire teen readers to opt for a
military career when they reach the right age, " the official said.</P>
      <P>The publication contains seven chapters that explain in detail the functions and
duties of military service personnel as well as the country's major combat
arsenals, the official said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>20 percent of Taiwan's people have contemplated suicide: survey</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 20 percent of Taiwan's people have thought of committing suicide during
their lifetimes, and about one-sixth of them have actually tried to kill
themselves, a survey showed Monday.</P>
      <P>According to this year's results of the annual survey on attitudes toward
suicide conducted by the Taiwan Suicide Prevention Center (TSPC) among citizens
above the age of 15, 19.7 percent of respondents said they had at some point
contemplated committing suicide, and 4.4 percent admitted to having such
thoughts over the past year.</P>
      <P>The 20 percent figure, consistent with past surveys, indicates there is a
considerable proportion of people who have been troubled by suicide issues, the
TSPC said at a press conference.</P>
      <P>The center also found that among people who have emotional problems, 17.22
percent were found to have suicidal thoughts, a sign that emotional problems
were a risk factor for suicide.</P>
      <P>Treating emotional disabilities early, therefore, could help mitigate suicidal
behavior, the center contended.</P>
      <P>Lee Ming-pin, director of the center under the Department of Health (DOH) ,
suggested people can use a simple online symptoms rating scale to assess the
level of emotional distress.</P>
      <P>If people find their emotional problems exceed a predetermined level, they
should seek professional advice or therapy to avoid being susceptible to
suicidal behavior, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's suicide mortality rate increased by 3.3 percent in 2008 from the
previous year -- a trend some believe may have been linked to financial problems
caused by the slumping economy.</P>
      <P>Suicides by both men and women claimed 4,128 lives last year, making it the
ninth leading cause of death in Taiwan, up one spot from 2007, a DOH report
showed.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Prosecutors have launched an investigation into allegations of game fixing
during the 2009 regular season of Taiwan's professional baseball league, dealing
another harsh blow to the professional league's already tainted image.</P>
      <P>The Banciao District Prosecutors Office issued summons Monday to 17 people for
questioning in connection with the investigation, including three witnesses, and
29 raids on underground betting parlors and players around the country were also
conducted.</P>
      <P>The main focus of the probe, which covers the alleged fixing of games in
Taiwan's Chinese Professional Baseball League from May to September, is an
underground bookie with the family name of Tsai, who goes by the nickname
"Windshield Wiper."</P>
      <P>Prosecutors believe Tsai enticed players to throw games or manipulate the final
score in ways to help the bookie's syndicate cash in on illicit bets.</P>
      <P>According to evidence collected by the Taipei branch of the Ministry of
Justice's Investigation Bureau, the players rigged games in a number of ways,
including grooving easy pitches to hit, walking batters, purposely committing
errors or deliberately striking out.</P>
      <P>Once the gambling syndicate run by Tsai cashed in on its bets as a result of the
players' actions, it would then pay off the players through intermediaries, the
Investigation Bureau believes.</P>
      <P>Though the investigation  has been underway  for a while, prosecutors  wanted
to wait for the league's  showcase,  the best-of-seven Taiwan Series, to
conclude before summoning persons of interest for questioning and conducting
raids.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Series ended Sunday, with the Uni-President Lions defeating the
Brother Elephants 5-2 in Game 7 to win its third consecutive CPBL title.</P>
      <P>Though the seven-game series is not within the scope of the investigation, a
number of Elephant players have been implicated in the case.</P>
      <P>On Monday, Elephants general manager Hung Rei-ho confirmed that searches had
been conducted on the dorm rooms or residences of six of the team's players --
pitchers Tsao Chin-hui, Liu Yu-chan, Wu Bau-hsien,Wang Chin-li, and Li Hao-jen
and catcher Wang Chun-tai. The six players will also be summoned for questioning
on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hung said the three players he was able to reach after receiving news of the
raids -- Tsao, Liu and Wang Chun-tai -- all stressed that they were not involved
in the case and found the raids bizarre.</P>
      <P>Tsao, the first Taiwanese pitcher to ever compete in the U.S. Major Leagues,
became particularly agitated at one point over the issue, according to Hung.</P>
      <P>In a statement released Monday, Tsao insisted that he was clean and that after
fighting repeated arm injuries and pressure to get back on the field, he was
perplexed over being searched and wrongly implicated in the case.</P>
      <P>"After playing overseas for nine years, there were still some overseas teams
that I could have joined, but I decided to come home, expecting to continue
fighting and contributing in front of my family and friends," Tsao said.</P>
      <P>"Little did I expect that after my teammates and I played hard for a full season
that I would be summoned for questioning about a controversy I know nothing
about. I feel angry and disappointed."</P>
      <P>He wondered in the statement if, after being caught up in allegations that had
yet to be substantiated with proof, he had made the right choice to play in
Taiwan this year.</P>
      <P>Hung, who vowed last year during a similar game-fixing scandal to disband his
team if any of his players were involving in gambling and game fixing, said he
chose to believe his players' professions of innocence, pending the results of
the investigation.</P>
      <P>The Chinese Professional Baseball League nearly imploded at the height of its
popularity in 1996 and 1997 because of a massive gambling scandal in which
players were accosted by gangsters and forced in some cases to throw games.</P>
      <P>That resulting in the disbanding of three teams between 1997 and 1999 and
charges brought against a number of players and officials.</P>
      <P>In December 2004, a total of 22 players were convicted of fraud for game fixing
related to the charges, but their sentences ranging from seven to 22 months were
suspended. The players, however, were blacklisted from the league in any
capacity.</P>
      <P>Another gambling scandal that erupted in 2005, implicating a number of foreign
players, dealt another blow to the league just as it seemed to be regaining its
credibility with fans.</P>
      <P>The problem was compounded in 2008 when the management of one of the CPBL's
franchises,  the dmedia T-Rex,  was alleged to be cooperating with local
gangsters in fixing games.</P>
      <P>The team was immediately expelled and when the Chinatrust Whales pulled out a
month later, only four teams were left in the league.</P>
      <P>Hung voiced his impatience over the inability of the government and the league
to crack down over the past decade on illegal gambling syndicates and the
gangsters who approach the players to throw games in exchange for favors or
cash.</P>
      <P>He urged the government to show some determination in providing a clean
environment in which the game can grow.</P>
      <P>But Lin Chi-feng, the chief prosecutor of the Tainan District Prosecutors Office
who oversees the supervision of CPBL games in Tainan, said the latest scandal
could be the last straw.</P>
      <P>"If the players really were involved in rigging games again, the only baseball
fans will be able to watch in the future is Little League," he said.</P>
      <P>Lin said his supervision group did not detect any abnormalities in 45 games this
year and hoped that the investigation will exonerate the players.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan, China to exchange 'early harvest' lists for free trade pact</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan and China will soon take a critical step forward toward their goal of
signing an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) , as they will
exchange "early harvest" lists next week, officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang, Taiwan and China will
hold a fourth round of informal talks on the ECFA deal in Beijing Nov. 3-4,
during which they will touch on "early harvest" issues for the first time.</P>
      <P>The "early harvest" lists refer to industries or services that each side will
open for immediate tariff concessions or more liberal trade terms under the
ECFA, similar to provisions under a free trade agreement.</P>
      <P>"During the forthcoming round of talks, the two sides will exchange their 'early
harvest' lists and discuss each listed item, but we do not think that a
consensus can be reached immediately at the meeting," Shih said.</P>
      <P>On a recent statement made by Wang Yi, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office
under China's State Council, that Beijing hopes ECFA-related talks can get
underway this year, Shih said Taiwan welcomes China's positive attitue toward
the deal.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government hopes to seal an ECFA agreement with China as soon as
possible to reduce the impact on Taiwanese businesses of the economic
integration of China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),
which comes into force next year.</P>
      <P>After the China-ASEAN free trade agreement takes effect on Jan. 1, 2010,
petrochemical products, textiles, automobile parts and machinery exports from
ASEAN states to China will enjoy tariff-free treatment, which Taiwan's officials
said will seriously undermine the competitiveness of similar products from
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shih said Huang Chih-peng, director of the Bureau of Foreign Trade under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), is scheduled to depart for Beijing Nov. 2
at the head of a delegation of officials for the informal round of ECFA talks.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the ECFA issue will be discussed further at a high-level meeting
of the two cross-strait intermediary bodies in Taiwan in December, Shih said the
topic could be put on the agenda for senior negotiators from both sides to
exchange views.</P>
      <P>Shih was referring  to a meeting between Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman
Chiang Pin-kung and his Chinese counterpart, Chen Yunlin, president of the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>The forthcoming Chiang-Chen meeting, the fourth in a series since June 2008, has
a broad range of issues on its agenda and agreements are expected to be signed
on fishing crew cooperation, agricultural quarantine inspection, industrial
product standards, inspection and certification, and the avoidance of double
taxation.</P>
      <P>As the ECFA agreement involves complex market opening issues, Shih said it's
hard to predict  at the moment when relevant negotiations can be concluded.</P>
      <P>Noting that the three previous informal rounds of ECFA talks proceeded smoothly,
Shih said the government is optimistic that a formal deal can be struck next
year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, MOEA officials said the ministry has finalized a tentative "early
harvest" list of industries and services for immediate tariff concession or
market opening.</P>
      <P>The  list  will  cover  banking  and securities  services, computer-related
services,  research and development  services, logistics services and commercial
aircraft maintenance services as well as upper- and mid-stream textiles,
petrochemicals, machine tools and flat panels, according to the officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Businesses look to emerging markets in developing WiMAX market</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 26 (CNA)
10/26/09  22:00:56
(By Anita Pan &amp; Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There is plenty of room for WiMAX operators and manufacturers of devices and
equipment for WiMAX end users to explore commercial opportunities in emerging
markets, said Ron Resnick, president and chairman of the WiMAX Forum, on Monday.</P>
      <P>At the WiMAX Summit Taiwan 2009 that opened Monday at the Taiwan International
Convention Center in Taipei, Resnick said that as of the second quarter of 2009,
broadband networks reached 433 million people around the world, a number that is
expected to expand to 800 million by the end of 2010.</P>
      <P>Resnick said broadband coverage was widest in the Asia-Pacific region, Africa
and Latin America.</P>
      <P>One study has projected that as of Dec. 31, 2010, there will be nearly 205
million WiMAX users in the Asia-Pacific region, 52 million in Africa and 49.5
million in Latin America. The figures indicate WiMAX will be a star product in
emerging markets, Resnick said.</P>
      <P>Introducing the benefits of WiMAX technology, the business leader said it can
narrow the digital gap between urban and rural areas and between rich and poor
countries.</P>
      <P>It can also  facilitate  the acquisition  of medical  and education-related
information and knowledge and should also help boost economic development,
Resnick argued.</P>
      <P>Citing a recent World Bank report, Resnick said that every 10 percent of growth
in the broadband coverage rate in a country could contribute a 1.3 percentage
point increase in gross domestic product (GDP), an indication of broadband
technology's potential to generate economic growth.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that there are currently 500 WiMax networks in 145
countries, and that the worldwide number of WiMAX networks has been increasing
at a monthly double-digit growth rate.</P>
      <P>In his address, Resnick revealed the WiMAX Forum's Taiwan office has begun WiMAX
roaming tests in Taiwan through the U.S.-based roaming exchange operator Aicent
to help cut short the time that local WiMAX operators need to their launch
commercial services.</P>
      <P>They have completed tests on domestic roaming and international roaming between
Taiwan and the United States, he added.</P>
      <P>The WiMAX Forum is an industry-led, not-for-profit organization formed to
certify and promote the compatibility and interoperability of broadband wireless
products.</P>
      <P>Its goals include taking measures to accelerate the introduction of WiMAX
systems  into  the  marketplace,  promoting  product certification, and pushing
for educational training in the relevant industries and industrial cooperation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei City to form alliance against imports of U.S. beef offals</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.26 (CNA)
10/26/09  23:09:35
(By Sun Cheng-wu, Lee Shu-hua and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In a rare rebuke of the central government, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-pin voiced
outright opposition Monday to the government's latest decision to allow imports
of U.S. beef offals and ground beef, saying the city government will take active
steps to boycott the decision.</P>
      <P>Hau said the city government will encourage the city's 15,000 hotels, department
stores, hypermarts and restaurants to form an alliance whose members will reject
sales of U.S. beef offals, ground beef and spinal cords or their use as
ingredients over health concerns.</P>
      <P>"We have also tentatively decided that city officials will intensify inspection
of shops that have not joined the alliance after U.S. beef offals, ground beef
and spinal cords are formally allowed to enter Taiwan next month," Hau added.</P>
      <P>Yeh Ching-yuan, director of the city's Rules and Regulations Commission, said
the municipal government has the authority to conduct spot checks or regular
checks on products that are likely to harm human health or personal property in
accordance with the country's Consumers Protection Act.</P>
      <P>Under the law, Yeh said, the city government is also authorized to slap fines
ranging between NT$30,000 and NT$300,000 on companies that do not cooperate in
investigations or spot checks.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the city government plans to issue "self-management" certificates to
companies that agree to join the alliance.</P>
      <P>According to the Consumers Protection Law, Yeh said, alliance members who are
found to have broken their promise and used the banned U.S. beef products as
ingredients in their dishes will be asked to stop such practices within a
specified period of time.</P>
      <P>"Those who fail to improve within the deadline can be fined between NT$60,000
and NT$1.5 million in line with the law," Yeh said, adding that the fine can
also be imposed consecutively.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) announced Oct. 23 that Taiwan would
expand market access for U.S. beef after officials of the two countries clinched
an accord the previous day in Washington, D.C., to lift a partial ban on U.S.
beef imports.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the new accord, U.S. bone-in beef, ground beef, intestines,
brains, spinal cords and processed beef from cattle younger than 30 months that
have not been contaminated with "specific risk materials" will be allowed to
enter Taiwan starting Nov. 10.</P>
      <P>Specific risk materials are defined in the protocol as the brain, skull, eyes,
trigeminal ganglia, spinal cord, vertebral column and dorsal root ganglia from
cattle 30 months of age and older, or tonsils and the distal ileum of the small
intestine from cattle of all ages.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan only allows imports of U.S. boneless beef from cattle younger
than 30 months that contain no specified risk materials.</P>
      <P>The new market opening decision has since drawn flak from opposition parties and
consumer rights activists.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau was the first local government chief to announce a boycott
plan.</P>
      <P>Response from his counterparts in other cities and counties were mixed, with
some saying they will consider following suit after getting more information
about Taipei's measures while others showing no interest in taking similar
moves.</P>
      <P>Taipei County's health authorities said the county government will demand that
beef traders or retailers clearly identify the origin of their products so that
consumers will be able to knowingly make choices on their own.</P>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said he will consider following suit after the Taipei
city government unveils detailed measures.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung  City said it will not follow Taipei's lead in boycotting the central
government's decision to offer access to U.S. beef offals, but it urged the
central government to review its latest decision.</P>
      <P>But neighboring Kaohsiung County said it will take cue from Taipei City's
measures to boycott U.S. beef offals.</P>
      <P>Commenting on local governments' boycott plans, Presidential Office spokesman
Wang Yu-chi said the government will make every possible effort to prevent U.S.
beef offals with specific risk materials from entering Taiwan after the new
market opening measures take effect.</P>
      <P>In fact, Wang said, the government has already applied standards that are
stricter than the requirements set forth by the World Organization for Animal
Health and the European Union in beef import negotiations with the United
States.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office Minister Su Jun-pin also said relevant
administrative agenices will "exhaust all means" and apply the most stringent
criteria to protect public health in dealing with U.S. beef import applications.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Resignation of CSC members helps party reforms: KMT chair</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 26 (CNA)
10/26/09  23:14:31
(By Lee Shu-hua and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that he was touched to see so many KMT
Central Standing Committee (CSC) members resign in a bid to show their support
for reforms.</P>
      <P>The president, who doubles as KMT chairman, made the remarks at a KMT
provisional meeting that was held to deal with the by-election of the CSC
members.</P>
      <P>All 32 CSC members decided to step down amid criticism that the Oct. 11 CSC
election was marred by rampant vote-buying.</P>
      <P>The party kicked two members out of the CSC Oct. 20 for their involvement in
bribery during the election, but the move failed to stop mounting calls from
party members for a new election of the committee.</P>
      <P>The newly elected CSC members began the unprecedented mass stepdown after Ma
openly said that he would encourage them do so.</P>
      <P>Ma said vote-buying allegations undermine the CSC's image and credibility and
stressed that he had to deal with the matter "quickly and cautiously."</P>
      <P>He said that he was "moved to see so many CSC members willing to offer to resign
in support of reforms."</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that the by-election, both through its process and
results, will make people sense that the KMT has changed, which he said will not
only help the party's chance to win in the Dec. 5 local chief elections, but
will also benefit the long-term development of the party.</P>
      <P>During the time between now and the scheduled by-election in mid-November, the
public will watch closely how the by-election is being conducted, and the
performance of all candidates will affect the party's image and the CSC's
credibility, Ma said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan indigenous algae strain rich in DHA content: NCKU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26 (CNA)
10/26/09  18:38:18
(By Liu Kwang-yin and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) research team has discovered an
indigenous algae that is rich in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) , containing 10
times as much of the omega-3 fatty acid as existing DHA supplements such as fish
oil.</P>
      <P>The indigenous DHA-rich algae strain, called BL10, was discovered after the team
isolated, cultivated and identified marine microalgae from 10 marine  habitats
around  Taiwan,  Yang Huey-lang,  a distinguished professor in NCKU's Institute
of Biotechnology.</P>
      <P>"BL10 proved to have the highest DHA yield among all studied algae strains and
could become an excellent source of microbial DHA," Yang said at a news
conference held in Taipei.</P>
      <P>DHA is thought to benefit human health,  particularly  in preventing
cardiovascular  disease,  reducing inflammation  and improving cognitive
functions.</P>
      <P>Chen Yi-min, an assistant professor in the NCKU's Research Center of Ocean
Environment and Technology and one of the managers of the research project, said
that after the BL10 algae is dried into a powder, it has a DHA content of 0.3
grams per gram of powder, a concentration that is 10 times higher than the DHA
found in deep sea fish such as salmon and tuna.</P>
      <P>If the BL10 algae is used to extract an algae oil, the oil's DHA concentration
can reach 50 percent, far higher than the 5 to 10 percent found in deep sea fish
oil, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The BL10 algae also has the advantage of not having the pungent smell of fish,
making it more acceptable to consumers as an additive to yogurt drinks and
infant milk formulas or as a supplement.</P>
      <P>At Monday's news conference, the research team announced that the know-how
related to BL10 has been transferred to local biotech firm Vedan Biotechnology
for commercialization.</P>
      <P>Vedan Biotechnology President Yang Shih-an said the company is expected to start
commercial production or a related product line in two years and hopes to
generate sales of between NT$1 billion and NT$2 billion within three to five
years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to review effects of Chinese investment later this year</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>It will take a while for Chinese investment in Taiwan to bear fruit and the
government will come up with an assessment report later this year, a Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has long allowed its businessmen to invest in many industries in China,
but it did not open its doors to Chinese investment in a limited number of
sectors until June this year.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun said the government has been using the six months
following  the June 30 implementation  of the regulations governing Chinese
investment in Taiwan as a period for publicity, promotion and experimentation.</P>
      <P>"We believe it will take a while for this new market opening policy to come to
fruition or for the effects to become apparent, " Liu said, adding that the MAC
is scheduled to conduct an overall review of the relevant measures late this
year, with the conclusions of the study serving as a basis for further
improvement of government policy toward Chinese investment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks a day after China's top official in charge of Taiwan
affairs urged Taiwan to further liberalize its regulations on investment from
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Wang Yi, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under China's State Council, said
at a seminar on cross-strait relations held in Chengdu in China's Sichuan
Province that China welcomes Taiwan's opening to Chinese investors but hopes
that the scope of the permitted areas for investment can be expanded.</P>
      <P>"We also hope that Taiwan will offer our investors a more fair and more
reasonable business environment and provide our Taiwan-based management
personnel with greater convenience, " Wang said.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released by the Investment Commission under the Ministry
of Economic Affairs, 15 Chinese investment projects totaling NT$190 million
(US$5.9 million) have been approved since the new regulations governing Chinese
investment in Taiwan took effect June 30.</P>

      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun said Monday that if the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait decide the time is right, they can exchange views
on the signing of an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) at a fourth
round of high-level cross-strait talks scheduled for December.</P>
      <P>However, he stressed that the main aim of the next round of talks will be
signing off on four major issues that have already been identified and
discussed.</P>
      <P>Liu said the Ministry of Economic Affairs and relevant Chinese officials have
completed their respective studies on the proposed trade pact and have been
informally exchanging views before entering a stage of joint research  to create
the best platform  for negotiations.</P>
      <P>"If both sides are ready, ECFA discussions will not be ruled out during the
fourth round of cross-strait talks," said Liu.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks after China's top official in charge of Taiwan affairs said
a day earlier that Beijing hopes the two sides can begin ECFA-related talks
within this year.</P>
      <P>Wang Yi, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of China's State Council, said at
an economic seminar in China that if both sides agree, they can exchange views
on ECFA-related issues during the fourth round of cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>Wang's statement marked the first official response from the Chinese authorities
to Taiwan's recent call for striking an ECFA deal as soon as possible. His
remarks suggested that ECFA issues are expected to be formally discussed at the
fourth round of talks.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office, in the first official comment on Wang's remarks, said
Taiwan will conduct ECFA-related talks with China as originally planned.</P>
      <P>The fourth round of talks between Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman
Chiang Pin-kung and his Chinese counterpart Chen Yunlin, president of the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , is
slated to take place in the central Taiwan city of Taichung sometime in the
second half of December.</P>
      <P>According to the SEF -- the semi-official intermediary body founded to deal with
cross-strait exchanges in the absence of official links -- Chiang has been
authorized by the Cabinet- level MAC to talk about four major issues: a safety
check and quality certification system for agricultural products; moves to
prevent double taxation; cooperation on fishery manpower affairs;  and
cooperation on the promotion of standard product quality checking and
certification.</P>
      <P>Chiang mentioned earlier that the signing of an ECFA is expected to take place
during a fifth round of SEF-ARATS talks.</P>

      <P>With WiMAX technologies attracting the most attention at Broadband Taiwan 2009,
President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday at the opening of the show that it proves he
made the "right decision" as Taipei mayor to build a WiFLY network that was
later transformed to WiMax.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the opening day of the three-day trade show, Ma said the Taipei City
government began working with Intel Corp. and Taipei-based Chunghwa Telecom Co.
in 2002 to first construct an outdoor wireless communication network in the
upscale Xinyi district, from which the network was expanded to cover an area of
230 square kilometers.</P>
      <P>More than 4,000 access points were eventually established in the 271.8 sq. km.
city to realize his initiative of turning Taiwan's capital into a wireless city,
Ma noted.</P>
      <P>Citing a study which estimated that there will be 700 million WiMAX users
worldwide by 2013, Ma said the assessment shows his policy of building a
wireless city was on the right course.</P>
      <P>Describing his WiMAX experience, Ma said he once used WiMAX on a running metro
train and found that he could surf the Internet as quickly in an environment
moving at high speed as in a static building.</P>
      <P>That advantage, and WiMAX's edge in terms of construction cost and efficiency
relative to other broadband technologies means Taiwan could use WiMAX as the
core technology in developing its service sector.</P>
      <P>Broadband Taiwan 2009 is taking place in conjunction with several international
conferences,  including  the WiMAX Forum  Member Conference, WiMAX Summit Taiwan
2009, the IPTV Development Forum, and the Broadband  Forum  Taiwan  2009,
making  WiMAX  (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) the theme of
the trade show.</P>
      <P>The event, co-organized by the semi-official Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA) and the Taiwan Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers'
Association (TEEMA) ,  is hosting 132 exhibitors at the Taipei World Trade
Center to showcase broadband products ranging from parts and components to
software.</P>
      <P>At the opening ceremony, TAITRA Chairman Wang Chih-kang described 2009 as the
beginning of the WiMAX era in both Taiwan and the world, as businesses around
the globe are gearing up to fight for a share of multibillion US dollar WiMAX
market.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, six local WiMAX operators -- including Tatung InfoComm and Global
Mobil Corp. -- will launch commercial services at the end of this year and next
year.</P>
      <P>According to a report by Taiwan's nongovernmental Institute of Information
Industry, the global production value of WiMAX devices and equipment for users
will reach US$9.33 billion in 2012, and that Taiwan's WiMAX equipment output is
expected to grow by 162-fold between 2006 and 2012 to US$3.78 billion.</P>
      <P>At the trade show, local telecommunication operators introduced many WiMAX
technology applications, including Internet yellow cabs that offer online and
multimedia services.</P>
      <P>WiMAX is a telecommunications technology that provides wireless transmission of
data using a variety of transmission modes, from point-to-multipoint links to
portable and fully mobile internet access</P>

      <P>In an unprecedented move, the Ministry of National Defense (MND) has prepared a
comic-book version of its latest defense White Paper as part of its efforts to
cultivate interest in military service among young readers, an official said
Monday.</P>
      <P>The ministry will host a news conference Tuesday to introduce this new version
of its newly released 2009 National Defense White Paper, the MND official said.</P>
      <P>In addition to expounding on various national defense programs, the official
said, the new comic book will also provide answers to many frequently asked
questions about national defense and military service.</P>
      <P>Two of the leading characters -- an armored vehicle captain and a navy frogwoman
-- featured in the special edition of the defense White Paper will appear at the
news conference, the official said, and they will be joined by the three
cartoonists who worked on the project.</P>
      <P>The official said the publication represented a bold step for the traditionally
staid and conservative ministry to reach out to the younger generation in a
lively, animated style.</P>
      <P>"The new approach is part of our efforts to attract more youngsters to sign up
for military service, as the government is set to establish an all-volunteer
military by 2015," the official said.</P>
      <P>While the ministry's regularly published defense White Papers could be good
material to help students grasp what military service is like, they may be too
difficult, complex and boring for young readers, the official said.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, we have decided to break with tradition and publish a comic-book
version of our defense White Paper, " he said, adding that the traditional form
of the 2009 defense White Paper was released Oct.20.</P>
      <P>The ministry has published 10,000 copies of the comic book, which will mainly
target junior high school students, who tend to be avid fans of the medium. The
comic books will sell for NT$100 (US$3.12) apiece.</P>
      <P>"Through an illustrated  and animated dialogue style,  the comic-book version of
our defense White Paper is expected to inspire teen readers to opt for a
military career when they reach the right age, " the official said.</P>
      <P>The publication contains seven chapters that explain in detail the functions and
duties of military service personnel as well as the country's major combat
arsenals, the official said.</P>

themselves, a survey showed Monday.</P>
      <P>According to this year's results of the annual survey on attitudes toward
suicide conducted by the Taiwan Suicide Prevention Center (TSPC) among citizens
above the age of 15, 19.7 percent of respondents said they had at some point
contemplated committing suicide, and 4.4 percent admitted to having such
thoughts over the past year.</P>
      <P>The 20 percent figure, consistent with past surveys, indicates there is a
considerable proportion of people who have been troubled by suicide issues, the
TSPC said at a press conference.</P>
      <P>The center also found that among people who have emotional problems, 17.22
percent were found to have suicidal thoughts, a sign that emotional problems
were a risk factor for suicide.</P>
      <P>Treating emotional disabilities early, therefore, could help mitigate suicidal
behavior, the center contended.</P>
      <P>Lee Ming-pin, director of the center under the Department of Health (DOH) ,
suggested people can use a simple online symptoms rating scale to assess the
level of emotional distress.</P>
      <P>If people find their emotional problems exceed a predetermined level, they
should seek professional advice or therapy to avoid being susceptible to
suicidal behavior, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's suicide mortality rate increased by 3.3 percent in 2008 from the
previous year -- a trend some believe may have been linked to financial problems
caused by the slumping economy.</P>
      <P>Suicides by both men and women claimed 4,128 lives last year, making it the
ninth leading cause of death in Taiwan, up one spot from 2007, a DOH report
showed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New game-fixing scandal rocks CPBL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 26 (CNA)
10/26/09  21:54:37
(By Huang Hsu-sheng, Cheng Chi-feng and Luke Sabatier)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Prosecutors have launched an investigation into allegations of game fixing
during the 2009 regular season of Taiwan's professional baseball league, dealing
another harsh blow to the professional league's already tainted image.</P>
      <P>The Banciao District Prosecutors Office issued summons Monday to 17 people for
questioning in connection with the investigation, including three witnesses, and
29 raids on underground betting parlors and players around the country were also
conducted.</P>
      <P>The main focus of the probe, which covers the alleged fixing of games in
Taiwan's Chinese Professional Baseball League from May to September, is an
underground bookie with the family name of Tsai, who goes by the nickname
"Windshield Wiper."</P>
      <P>Prosecutors believe Tsai enticed players to throw games or manipulate the final
score in ways to help the bookie's syndicate cash in on illicit bets.</P>
      <P>According to evidence collected by the Taipei branch of the Ministry of
Justice's Investigation Bureau, the players rigged games in a number of ways,
including grooving easy pitches to hit, walking batters, purposely committing
errors or deliberately striking out.</P>
      <P>Once the gambling syndicate run by Tsai cashed in on its bets as a result of the
players' actions, it would then pay off the players through intermediaries, the
Investigation Bureau believes.</P>
      <P>Though the investigation  has been underway  for a while, prosecutors  wanted
to wait for the league's  showcase,  the best-of-seven Taiwan Series, to
conclude before summoning persons of interest for questioning and conducting
raids.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Series ended Sunday, with the Uni-President Lions defeating the
Brother Elephants 5-2 in Game 7 to win its third consecutive CPBL title.</P>
      <P>Though the seven-game series is not within the scope of the investigation, a
number of Elephant players have been implicated in the case.</P>
      <P>On Monday, Elephants general manager Hung Rei-ho confirmed that searches had
been conducted on the dorm rooms or residences of six of the team's players --
pitchers Tsao Chin-hui, Liu Yu-chan, Wu Bau-hsien,Wang Chin-li, and Li Hao-jen
and catcher Wang Chun-tai. The six players will also be summoned for questioning
on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hung said the three players he was able to reach after receiving news of the
raids -- Tsao, Liu and Wang Chun-tai -- all stressed that they were not involved
in the case and found the raids bizarre.</P>
      <P>Tsao, the first Taiwanese pitcher to ever compete in the U.S. Major Leagues,
became particularly agitated at one point over the issue, according to Hung.</P>
      <P>In a statement released Monday, Tsao insisted that he was clean and that after
fighting repeated arm injuries and pressure to get back on the field, he was
perplexed over being searched and wrongly implicated in the case.</P>
      <P>"After playing overseas for nine years, there were still some overseas teams
that I could have joined, but I decided to come home, expecting to continue
fighting and contributing in front of my family and friends," Tsao said.</P>
      <P>"Little did I expect that after my teammates and I played hard for a full season
that I would be summoned for questioning about a controversy I know nothing
about. I feel angry and disappointed."</P>
      <P>He wondered in the statement if, after being caught up in allegations that had
yet to be substantiated with proof, he had made the right choice to play in
Taiwan this year.</P>
      <P>Hung, who vowed last year during a similar game-fixing scandal to disband his
team if any of his players were involving in gambling and game fixing, said he
chose to believe his players' professions of innocence, pending the results of
the investigation.</P>
      <P>The Chinese Professional Baseball League nearly imploded at the height of its
popularity in 1996 and 1997 because of a massive gambling scandal in which
players were accosted by gangsters and forced in some cases to throw games.</P>
      <P>That resulting in the disbanding of three teams between 1997 and 1999 and
charges brought against a number of players and officials.</P>
      <P>In December 2004, a total of 22 players were convicted of fraud for game fixing
related to the charges, but their sentences ranging from seven to 22 months were
suspended. The players, however, were blacklisted from the league in any
capacity.</P>
      <P>Another gambling scandal that erupted in 2005, implicating a number of foreign
players, dealt another blow to the league just as it seemed to be regaining its
credibility with fans.</P>
      <P>The problem was compounded in 2008 when the management of one of the CPBL's
franchises,  the dmedia T-Rex,  was alleged to be cooperating with local
gangsters in fixing games.</P>
      <P>The team was immediately expelled and when the Chinatrust Whales pulled out a
month later, only four teams were left in the league.</P>
      <P>Hung voiced his impatience over the inability of the government and the league
to crack down over the past decade on illegal gambling syndicates and the
gangsters who approach the players to throw games in exchange for favors or
cash.</P>
      <P>He urged the government to show some determination in providing a clean
environment in which the game can grow.</P>
      <P>But Lin Chi-feng, the chief prosecutor of the Tainan District Prosecutors Office
who oversees the supervision of CPBL games in Tainan, said the latest scandal
could be the last straw.</P>
      <P>"If the players really were involved in rigging games again, the only baseball
fans will be able to watch in the future is Little League," he said.</P>
      <P>Lin said his supervision group did not detect any abnormalities in 45 games this
year and hoped that the investigation will exonerate the players.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan, China to exchange 'early harvest' lists for free trade pact</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and China will soon take a critical step forward toward their goal of
signing an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) , as they will
exchange "early harvest" lists next week, officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang, Taiwan and China will
hold a fourth round of informal talks on the ECFA deal in Beijing Nov. 3-4,
during which they will touch on "early harvest" issues for the first time.</P>
      <P>The "early harvest" lists refer to industries or services that each side will
open for immediate tariff concessions or more liberal trade terms under the
ECFA, similar to provisions under a free trade agreement.</P>
      <P>"During the forthcoming round of talks, the two sides will exchange their 'early
harvest' lists and discuss each listed item, but we do not think that a
consensus can be reached immediately at the meeting," Shih said.</P>
      <P>On a recent statement made by Wang Yi, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office
under China's State Council, that Beijing hopes ECFA-related talks can get
underway this year, Shih said Taiwan welcomes China's positive attitue toward
the deal.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government hopes to seal an ECFA agreement with China as soon as
possible to reduce the impact on Taiwanese businesses of the economic
integration of China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),
which comes into force next year.</P>
      <P>After the China-ASEAN free trade agreement takes effect on Jan. 1, 2010,
petrochemical products, textiles, automobile parts and machinery exports from
ASEAN states to China will enjoy tariff-free treatment, which Taiwan's officials
said will seriously undermine the competitiveness of similar products from
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shih said Huang Chih-peng, director of the Bureau of Foreign Trade under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), is scheduled to depart for Beijing Nov. 2
at the head of a delegation of officials for the informal round of ECFA talks.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the ECFA issue will be discussed further at a high-level meeting
of the two cross-strait intermediary bodies in Taiwan in December, Shih said the
topic could be put on the agenda for senior negotiators from both sides to
exchange views.</P>
      <P>Shih was referring  to a meeting between Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman
Chiang Pin-kung and his Chinese counterpart, Chen Yunlin, president of the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>The forthcoming Chiang-Chen meeting, the fourth in a series since June 2008, has
a broad range of issues on its agenda and agreements are expected to be signed
on fishing crew cooperation, agricultural quarantine inspection, industrial
product standards, inspection and certification, and the avoidance of double
taxation.</P>
      <P>As the ECFA agreement involves complex market opening issues, Shih said it's
hard to predict  at the moment when relevant negotiations can be concluded.</P>
      <P>Noting that the three previous informal rounds of ECFA talks proceeded smoothly,
Shih said the government is optimistic that a formal deal can be struck next
year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, MOEA officials said the ministry has finalized a tentative "early
harvest" list of industries and services for immediate tariff concession or
market opening.</P>
      <P>The  list  will  cover  banking  and securities  services, computer-related
services,  research and development  services, logistics services and commercial
aircraft maintenance services as well as upper- and mid-stream textiles,
petrochemicals, machine tools and flat panels, according to the officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Businesses look to emerging markets in developing WiMAX market</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>There is plenty of room for WiMAX operators and manufacturers of devices and
equipment for WiMAX end users to explore commercial opportunities in emerging
markets, said Ron Resnick, president and chairman of the WiMAX Forum, on Monday.</P>
      <P>At the WiMAX Summit Taiwan 2009 that opened Monday at the Taiwan International
Convention Center in Taipei, Resnick said that as of the second quarter of 2009,
broadband networks reached 433 million people around the world, a number that is
expected to expand to 800 million by the end of 2010.</P>
      <P>Resnick said broadband coverage was widest in the Asia-Pacific region, Africa
and Latin America.</P>
      <P>One study has projected that as of Dec. 31, 2010, there will be nearly 205
million WiMAX users in the Asia-Pacific region, 52 million in Africa and 49.5
million in Latin America. The figures indicate WiMAX will be a star product in
emerging markets, Resnick said.</P>
      <P>Introducing the benefits of WiMAX technology, the business leader said it can
narrow the digital gap between urban and rural areas and between rich and poor
countries.</P>
      <P>It can also  facilitate  the acquisition  of medical  and education-related
information and knowledge and should also help boost economic development,
Resnick argued.</P>
      <P>Citing a recent World Bank report, Resnick said that every 10 percent of growth
in the broadband coverage rate in a country could contribute a 1.3 percentage
point increase in gross domestic product (GDP), an indication of broadband
technology's potential to generate economic growth.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that there are currently 500 WiMax networks in 145
countries, and that the worldwide number of WiMAX networks has been increasing
at a monthly double-digit growth rate.</P>
      <P>In his address, Resnick revealed the WiMAX Forum's Taiwan office has begun WiMAX
roaming tests in Taiwan through the U.S.-based roaming exchange operator Aicent
to help cut short the time that local WiMAX operators need to their launch
commercial services.</P>
      <P>They have completed tests on domestic roaming and international roaming between
Taiwan and the United States, he added.</P>
      <P>The WiMAX Forum is an industry-led, not-for-profit organization formed to
certify and promote the compatibility and interoperability of broadband wireless
products.</P>
      <P>Its goals include taking measures to accelerate the introduction of WiMAX
systems  into  the  marketplace,  promoting  product certification, and pushing
for educational training in the relevant industries and industrial cooperation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei City to form alliance against imports of U.S. beef offals</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.26 (CNA)
10/26/09  23:09:35

    <TEXT>
      <P>In a rare rebuke of the central government, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-pin voiced
outright opposition Monday to the government's latest decision to allow imports
of U.S. beef offals and ground beef, saying the city government will take active
steps to boycott the decision.</P>
      <P>Hau said the city government will encourage the city's 15,000 hotels, department
stores, hypermarts and restaurants to form an alliance whose members will reject
sales of U.S. beef offals, ground beef and spinal cords or their use as
ingredients over health concerns.</P>
      <P>"We have also tentatively decided that city officials will intensify inspection
of shops that have not joined the alliance after U.S. beef offals, ground beef
and spinal cords are formally allowed to enter Taiwan next month," Hau added.</P>
      <P>Yeh Ching-yuan, director of the city's Rules and Regulations Commission, said
the municipal government has the authority to conduct spot checks or regular
checks on products that are likely to harm human health or personal property in
accordance with the country's Consumers Protection Act.</P>
      <P>Under the law, Yeh said, the city government is also authorized to slap fines
ranging between NT$30,000 and NT$300,000 on companies that do not cooperate in
investigations or spot checks.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the city government plans to issue "self-management" certificates to
companies that agree to join the alliance.</P>
      <P>According to the Consumers Protection Law, Yeh said, alliance members who are
found to have broken their promise and used the banned U.S. beef products as
ingredients in their dishes will be asked to stop such practices within a
specified period of time.</P>
      <P>"Those who fail to improve within the deadline can be fined between NT$60,000
and NT$1.5 million in line with the law," Yeh said, adding that the fine can
also be imposed consecutively.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) announced Oct. 23 that Taiwan would
expand market access for U.S. beef after officials of the two countries clinched
an accord the previous day in Washington, D.C., to lift a partial ban on U.S.
beef imports.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the new accord, U.S. bone-in beef, ground beef, intestines,
brains, spinal cords and processed beef from cattle younger than 30 months that
have not been contaminated with "specific risk materials" will be allowed to
enter Taiwan starting Nov. 10.</P>
      <P>Specific risk materials are defined in the protocol as the brain, skull, eyes,
trigeminal ganglia, spinal cord, vertebral column and dorsal root ganglia from
cattle 30 months of age and older, or tonsils and the distal ileum of the small
intestine from cattle of all ages.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan only allows imports of U.S. boneless beef from cattle younger
than 30 months that contain no specified risk materials.</P>
      <P>The new market opening decision has since drawn flak from opposition parties and
consumer rights activists.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau was the first local government chief to announce a boycott
plan.</P>
      <P>Response from his counterparts in other cities and counties were mixed, with
some saying they will consider following suit after getting more information
about Taipei's measures while others showing no interest in taking similar
moves.</P>
      <P>Taipei County's health authorities said the county government will demand that
beef traders or retailers clearly identify the origin of their products so that
consumers will be able to knowingly make choices on their own.</P>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said he will consider following suit after the Taipei
city government unveils detailed measures.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung  City said it will not follow Taipei's lead in boycotting the central
government's decision to offer access to U.S. beef offals, but it urged the
central government to review its latest decision.</P>
      <P>But neighboring Kaohsiung County said it will take cue from Taipei City's
measures to boycott U.S. beef offals.</P>
      <P>Commenting on local governments' boycott plans, Presidential Office spokesman
Wang Yu-chi said the government will make every possible effort to prevent U.S.
beef offals with specific risk materials from entering Taiwan after the new
market opening measures take effect.</P>
      <P>In fact, Wang said, the government has already applied standards that are
stricter than the requirements set forth by the World Organization for Animal
Health and the European Union in beef import negotiations with the United
States.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office Minister Su Jun-pin also said relevant
administrative agenices will "exhaust all means" and apply the most stringent
criteria to protect public health in dealing with U.S. beef import applications.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Resignation of CSC members helps party reforms: KMT chair</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that he was touched to see so many KMT
Central Standing Committee (CSC) members resign in a bid to show their support
for reforms.</P>
      <P>The president, who doubles as KMT chairman, made the remarks at a KMT
provisional meeting that was held to deal with the by-election of the CSC
members.</P>
      <P>All 32 CSC members decided to step down amid criticism that the Oct. 11 CSC
election was marred by rampant vote-buying.</P>
      <P>The party kicked two members out of the CSC Oct. 20 for their involvement in
bribery during the election, but the move failed to stop mounting calls from
party members for a new election of the committee.</P>
      <P>The newly elected CSC members began the unprecedented mass stepdown after Ma
openly said that he would encourage them do so.</P>
      <P>Ma said vote-buying allegations undermine the CSC's image and credibility and
stressed that he had to deal with the matter "quickly and cautiously."</P>
      <P>He said that he was "moved to see so many CSC members willing to offer to resign
in support of reforms."</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that the by-election, both through its process and
results, will make people sense that the KMT has changed, which he said will not
only help the party's chance to win in the Dec. 5 local chief elections, but
will also benefit the long-term development of the party.</P>
      <P>During the time between now and the scheduled by-election in mid-November, the
public will watch closely how the by-election is being conducted, and the
performance of all candidates will affect the party's image and the CSC's
credibility, Ma said.</P>

      <P>There is plenty of room for WiMAX operators and manufacturers of devices and
equipment for WiMAX end users to explore commercial opportunities in emerging
markets, said Ron Resnick, president and chairman of the WiMAX Forum, on Monday.</P>
      <P>At the WiMAX Summit Taiwan 2009 that opened Monday at the Taiwan International
Convention Center in Taipei, Resnick said that as of the second quarter of 2009,
broadband networks reached 433 million people around the world, a number that is
expected to expand to 800 million by the end of 2010.</P>
      <P>Resnick said broadband coverage was widest in the Asia-Pacific region, Africa
and Latin America.</P>
      <P>One study has projected that as of Dec. 31, 2010, there will be nearly 205
million WiMAX users in the Asia-Pacific region, 52 million in Africa and 49.5
million in Latin America. The figures indicate WiMAX will be a star product in
emerging markets, Resnick said.</P>
      <P>Introducing the benefits of WiMAX technology, the business leader said it can
narrow the digital gap between urban and rural areas and between rich and poor
countries.</P>
      <P>It can also  facilitate  the acquisition  of medical  and education-related
information and knowledge and should also help boost economic development,
Resnick argued.</P>
      <P>Citing a recent World Bank report, Resnick said that every 10 percent of growth
in the broadband coverage rate in a country could contribute a 1.3 percentage
point increase in gross domestic product (GDP), an indication of broadband
technology's potential to generate economic growth.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that there are currently 500 WiMax networks in 145
countries, and that the worldwide number of WiMAX networks has been increasing
at a monthly double-digit growth rate.</P>
      <P>In his address, Resnick revealed the WiMAX Forum's Taiwan office has begun WiMAX
roaming tests in Taiwan through the U.S.-based roaming exchange operator Aicent
to help cut short the time that local WiMAX operators need to their launch
commercial services.</P>
      <P>They have completed tests on domestic roaming and international roaming between
Taiwan and the United States, he added.</P>
      <P>The WiMAX Forum is an industry-led, not-for-profit organization formed to
certify and promote the compatibility and interoperability of broadband wireless
products.</P>
      <P>Its goals include taking measures to accelerate the introduction of WiMAX
systems  into  the  marketplace,  promoting  product certification, and pushing
for educational training in the relevant industries and industrial cooperation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei City to form alliance against imports of U.S. beef offals</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.26 (CNA)
10/27/09  09:39:15
(By Sun Cheng-wu, Lee Shu-hua and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In a rare rebuke of the central government, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-pin voiced
outright opposition Monday to the government's latest decision to allow imports
of U.S. beef offals and ground beef, saying the city government will take active
steps to boycott the decision.</P>
      <P>Hau said the city government will encourage the city's 15,000 hotels, department
stores, hypermarts and restaurants to form an alliance whose members will reject
sales of U.S. beef offals, ground beef and spinal cords or their use as
ingredients over health concerns.</P>
      <P>"We have also tentatively decided that city officials will intensify inspection
of shops that have not joined the alliance after U.S. beef offals, ground beef
and spinal cords are formally allowed to enter Taiwan next month," Hau added.</P>
      <P>Yeh Ching-yuan, director of the city's Rules and Regulations Commission, said
the municipal government has the authority to conduct spot checks or regular
checks on products that are likely to harm human health or personal property in
accordance with the country's Consumers Protection Act.</P>
      <P>Under the law, Yeh said, the city government is also authorized to slap fines
ranging between NT$30,000 and NT$300,000 on companies that do not cooperate in
investigations or spot checks.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the city government plans to issue "self-management" certificates to
companies that agree to join the alliance.</P>
      <P>According to the Consumers Protection Law, Yeh said, alliance members who are
found to have broken their promise and used the banned U.S. beef products as
ingredients in their dishes will be asked to stop such practices within a
specified period of time.</P>
      <P>"Those who fail to improve within the deadline can be fined between NT$60,000
and NT$1.5 million in line with the law," Yeh said, adding that the fine can
also be imposed consecutively.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) announced Oct. 23 that Taiwan would
expand market access for U.S. beef after officials of the two countries clinched
an accord the previous day in Washington, D.C., to lift a partial ban on U.S.
beef imports.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the new accord, U.S. bone-in beef, ground beef, intestines,
brains, spinal cords and processed beef from cattle younger than 30 months that
have not been contaminated with "specific risk materials" will be allowed to
enter Taiwan starting Nov. 10.</P>
      <P>Specific risk materials are defined in the protocol as the brain, skull, eyes,
trigeminal ganglia, spinal cord, vertebral column and dorsal root ganglia from
cattle 30 months of age and older, or tonsils and the distal ileum of the small
intestine from cattle of all ages.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan only allows imports of U.S. boneless beef from cattle younger
than 30 months that contain no specified risk materials.</P>
      <P>The new market opening decision has since drawn flak from opposition parties and
consumer rights activists.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau was the first local government chief to announce a boycott
plan.</P>
      <P>Response from his counterparts in other cities and counties were mixed, with
some saying they will consider following suit after getting more information
about Taipei's measures while others showing no interest in taking similar
moves.</P>
      <P>Taipei County's health authorities said the county government will demand that
beef traders or retailers clearly identify the origin of their products so that
consumers will be able to knowingly make choices on their own.</P>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said he will consider following suit after the Taipei
city government unveils detailed measures.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung  City said it will not follow Taipei's lead in boycotting the central
government's decision to offer access to U.S. beef offals, but it urged the
central government to review its latest decision.</P>
      <P>But neighboring Kaohsiung County said it will take cue from Taipei City's
measures to boycott U.S. beef offals.</P>
      <P>Commenting on local governments' boycott plans, Presidential Office spokesman
Wang Yu-chi said the government will make every possible effort to prevent U.S.
beef offals with specific risk materials from entering Taiwan after the new
market opening measures take effect.</P>
      <P>In fact, Wang said, the government has already applied standards that are
stricter than the requirements set forth by the World Organization for Animal
Health and the European Union in beef import negotiations with the United
States.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office Minister Su Jun-pin also said relevant
administrative agenices will "exhaust all means" and apply the most stringent
criteria to protect public health in dealing with U.S. beef import applications.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Resignation of CSC members helps party reforms: KMT chair</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 26 (CNA)
10/27/09  09:40:07

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that he was touched to see so many KMT
Central Standing Committee (CSC) members resign in a bid to show their support
for reforms.</P>
      <P>The president, who doubles as KMT chairman, made the remarks at a KMT
provisional meeting that was held to deal with the by-election of the CSC
members.</P>
      <P>All 32 CSC members decided to step down amid criticism that the Oct. 11 CSC
election was marred by rampant vote-buying.</P>
      <P>The party kicked two members out of the CSC Oct. 20 for their involvement in
bribery during the election, but the move failed to stop mounting calls from
party members for a new election of the committee.</P>
      <P>The newly elected CSC members began the unprecedented mass stepdown after Ma
openly said that he would encourage them do so.</P>
      <P>Ma said vote-buying allegations undermine the CSC's image and credibility and
stressed that he had to deal with the matter "quickly and cautiously."</P>
      <P>He said that he was "moved to see so many CSC members willing to offer to resign
in support of reforms."</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that the by-election, both through its process and
results, will make people sense that the KMT has changed, which he said will not
only help the party's chance to win in the Dec. 5 local chief elections, but
will also benefit the long-term development of the party.</P>
      <P>During the time between now and the scheduled by-election in mid-November, the
public will watch closely how the by-election is being conducted, and the
performance of all candidates will affect the party's image and the CSC's
credibility, Ma said.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese delegation is expected to visit the United States in November to
make preparations for the resumption of Trade and Investment Framework Agreement
talks between the two countries, a Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) official
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The delegation,  to be led by Yang Jen-ni,  deputy chief representative of the
Office of Trade Negotiations under the MOEA, will meet with the U.S. side to
discuss technical details of pending trade issues such as rice imports and
pesticide residues in food, the official said.</P>
      <P>He said, however, that it remains uncertain when the TIFA talks will officially
be resumed because there are other more imminent items on the U.S. trade agenda,
which include the ministerial meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum slated for mid-November  in Singapore  and the World  Trade
Organization Ministerial Conference scheduled for Nov. 3 to Dec. 2 in Geneva.</P>
      <P>To give a push to the restoration of the dialogue, Vice Minister of Economic
Affairs Hwang Jung-chiou will also call on officials in Washington D.C. when
visiting the U.S. next month to attend the annual conference of the ROC-USA
Economic Council, set for Nov. 27-28 in New York, the official said.</P>
      <P>The TIFA talks have become the most important channel of Taiwan-U.S.
communication on trade and economic issues since the severance of diplomatic
ties between the two countries in 1979. The event is hosted by Taiwan and the
United States every year on a rotational basis.</P>
      <P>The dialogue has been suspended since 2007, however, because of differences
between the two sides on various issues, including U.S. beef exports.</P>
      <P>Last week, the two sides reached agreement on a protocol on the liberalization
of U.S. beef products into the Taiwan market, removing a major irritant in
bilateral trade relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Palace Museum praised for rejecting controversial bronzes</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 27 (CNA)
10/27/09  12:59:34

    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Palace Museum (NPM)'s caution in pursuing two bronze statues
removed from China some 150 years ago, harshly condemned by local lawmakers, has
been praised by the International Council of Museums (ICOM).</P>
      <P>The NPM reportedly declined to purchase or accept for free Qing dynasty bronze
rat and rabbit heads from a French collector earlier this year. They were once
the property of the Imperial summer palace in Beijing, and China insists they be
treated as stolen property.</P>
      <P>NPM Director Chou Kung-shin denied that French businessman Pierre Berge ever
offered the works to her museum, but she told legislators the museum would never
accept artifacts that are controversial, stolen or of unknown origin, a stance
lauded by ICOM.</P>
      <P>"The Ethics Committee considers that (Chou), showed her care for museum ethics
issues internationally, and demonstrated a positive relation to the position of
the National Palace Museum, when it recently refrained from any move to purchase
the Qing bronze rat and rabbit head sculptures, " Bernice Murphy, chairperson of
the ICOM's Ethics Committee, told the Central News Agency in an e-mail Monday.</P>
      <P>According to Murphy, the ICOM's Ethics Committee addressed the bronze sculpture
matter recently at a meeting in Paris and was well aware of the controversy
surrounding the auctioning of the sculptures by Christie's in Paris in February
this year.</P>
      <P>Chou has reiterated twice at the Legislative Yuan this year that the NPM, as one
of the world's most famous museums, should follow professional ethics and uphold
its international image in not pursuing the pieces.</P>
      <P>Berge, partner of the late French fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent, said in a
radio interview in early October that he would never offer the works to China
and had hoped to give them to others.</P>
      <P>"I wanted to give them to the Taiwan Museum, which did not want to create a bone
of contention of such importance with mainland China. Or to the Musee Guimet,
but I don't think that France is any more interested in a quarrel with China,"
Berge said.</P>
      <P>During a legislative session in early October, Chou said that when she met Berge
in Paris in June, he told her that he "would neither sell nor donate the two
pieces, " but even if he had offered to donate the sculptures, the NPM would not
accept them based on professional ethics.</P>
      <P>Her stance drew the ire of lawmakers, who accused the government of kowtowing to
China and surrendering Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Murphy also praised Chou's visit to the Beijing Palace Museum in February and
her partnership venture to seek loans and prepare an exhibition in Taiwan that
will reunite objects from both museums.</P>
      <P>"This is aligned with other progressive projects of much interest and relevance
to principles supported by ICOM's Code of Ethics for Museums, and related ICOM
policies encouraging greater cooperation throughout the museums sector
internationally," Murphy said.</P>
      <P>"While museums around the world... continue to care for their long-developed
collections responsibly, there has been a progressive opening of negotiations by
many museums in recent years to evolve new ways of working -- especially on
joint exhibition projects -- across state and national borders," Murphy added.</P>
      <P>These initiatives  signal  a greater  awareness  of shared responsibilities in
caring for and interpreting cultural heritage internationally, she contended.</P>
      <P>The controversy that cast the NPM in the spotlight surfaced in February, when
Berge's two bronze sculptures were auctioned by Christie's.</P>
      <P>The bronzes of the Chinese zodiac animals were seized in 1860 from Beijing's
imperial summer palace, Yuanmingyuan, by invading French and British forces, and
China has demanded their return.</P>
      <P>China's Lost Cultural Relics Recovery Fund, an activist group, filed a petition
in France in an attempt to stop the auction, but a Paris tribunal rejected the
petition.</P>
      <P>The two pieces were sold at the Paris auction for 15.7 million euros each to a
telephone buyer who at the time remained anonymous. A few days later, Chinese
collector Cai Mingchao said that he was the successful bidder but would refuse
to pay for the statues, claiming that his bid was a "patriotic act" to sabotage
the auction.</P>
      <P>The two statues have since been sitting in a safe room at Christie's auction
house.</P>
      <P>According to a Reuters report, Berge has said he will return the two pieces to
China only if the country guarantees human rights and allows the exiled Tibetan
spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, to return home.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's consumer confidence in October rose to its highest level in 17 months,
another indication that the country's economy may be pulling out of a prolonged
slump set off by the global economic meltdown.</P>
      <P>The consumer confidence index for October stood at 60.56, up 4.11 points from
the September level and the highest since June 2008, according to the results of
the monthly survey released Tuesday by National Central University's Research
Center for Taiwan's Economic Development (RCTED).</P>
      <P>In October, all six sub-indices of the index rose, with the largest increase
seen in the sub-index for domestic economic outlook over the next six months,
which rose 9.5 points to 53.55.</P>
      <P>Judging from the numbers, however, the center said consumers were still
pessimistic about Taiwan's overall economic prospects, given that all six CCI
sub-indices were below 100.</P>
      <P>Consumers are said to be optimistic only when the index or sub-indices range
between 100 and 200.</P>
      <P>The sub-index posting the second largest increase in October was for projected
employment opportunities for the next six months, which rose 6.3 points from
September to 38.9, marking the greatest monthly surge in five years.</P>
      <P>The sub-index for projected family finances edged up 4.6 points to 56.95, while
that for projected durable good purchases over the next six months rose 1.85
points to 84.5.</P>
      <P>The sub-index for projected stock market investing over the next six months rose
1.8 points to 85.2, while that for projected domestic consumer prices over the
next six months climbed 0.6 points to 44.25.</P>
      <P>After dropping for 10 consecutive months from May 2008 to February 2009, when it
bottomed out at 48.42, the CCI began to climb in March, before falling slightly
in August and surging again in September and October.</P>
      <P>The survey of 2,400 adults randomly  selected  nationwide, conducted by Fu Jen
Catholic University for the RCTED, was carried out Oct. 19-22. It had a margin
of error of plus or minus two percentage points.</P>

      <P>Kuo said she felt nervous but also amazed to be one of the project's leading
characters and gave the comic book a score of 99 out of 100.</P>
      <P>"A comic-book version of the defense white paper can be more accessible to
people. I feel very honored to have taken on this mission," the short-haired Kuo
said at the press conference.</P>
      <P>Another leading character, Chen Shih-lin, who is an armored vehicle captain and
participated the rescue work after typhoon Morakot, said he hopes his
contribution can help attract more youngsters to sign up for military service.</P>
      <P>MND officials said the comic book project was completed in house with the help
of three cartoonists who graduated from the department of applied arts at Fu
Hsing Kang College under National Defense University.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the publication represented a bold step for the
traditionally staid and conservative ministry to reach out to the younger
generation in a lively, animated style.</P>
      <P>"The new approach is part of our efforts to attract more youngsters to sign up
for military service, as the government is set to establish an all-volunteer
military by 2015, " a MND official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The ministry has published 10,000 copies of the comic book, which will mainly
target junior high school students, who tend to be avid fans of the medium. The
comic books will sell for NT$100 (US$3.12) apiece.</P>

    <HEADLINE>British company partners with local firm to develop wind power</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  27  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>A leading British renewable energy development company has entered into a
partnership with a Taiwanese firm to further develop wind power in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>SeaEnergy PLC and Taiwan Generations Corp. (TGC) signed a Heads of Terms
Agreement to jointly develop TGC's pipeline of offshore windfarm projects. It is
the first offshore windfarm collaboration between the U.K. and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>David Campbell, director of the Taipei-based British Trade and Cultural Office
(BTCO) , said at the signing ceremony Tuesday that climate change is a global
issue, and Taiwan, which is a major importer of energy, has every incentive to
look to develop renewable resources.</P>
      <P>"Both the U.K. and Taiwan are islands, long coast lines, and we have lots of
offshore wind. So this looks to be a very important source of renewable energy
for the U.K. and Taiwan to exploit, " Campbell said.</P>
      <P>"We are delighted to witness this agreement between SeaEnergy and TGC. Both
partners bring tremendous expertise and knowledge on this sector."</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, the two companies will jointly plan, construct and operate
offshore windfarms in Taiwan, commencing with TGC's NT$40 billion (US$1.23
billion) Changhua offshore windfarm project that will have an installed capacity
of up to 600 megawatts.</P>
      <P>Joel Staadecker, CEO of SeaEnergy Renewables Ltd., the only listed offshore wind
energy company in the U.K. and an expert in the field, said the partnership is a
perfect way for his company to take its unique expertise overseas and explore
new opportunities at relatively low risk.</P>
      <P>"Renewable energy is one of the most important and rapidly growing industrial
sectors on the planet and it's exceedingly important that Taiwan recognize this
as an industrial sector, " Staadecker said.</P>
      <P>To Taiwan, developing wind power means not only power generation, but also
security of energy supply and price confidence, he added.</P>
      <P>According to TGC President Lin Sin-yu, his company conducted a nearly five-year
feasibility study on the project and has secured 11 permits and approvals from
the central and local governments.</P>
      <P>TGC, a leading local offshore windfarm development company and one of Taiwan's
few energy project development firms, hopes to establish a platform for
international players to bring their resources and successful development
experience to Taiwan to help it develop renewable energy and win global
recognition in the field.</P>
      <P>"However,  the government's  determination  to support  the development of
renewable energy and a good economic framework that will lead to a bankable
project structure are the keys to success, " Lin said.</P>
      <P>According  to Taiwan's  Council for Economic Planning  and Development (CEPD) ,
installed local wind power capacity in 2008 reached 358 MW, making the country
the world's 23rd largest producer of wind power.</P>
      <P>Under a new government policy to develop green energy, Taiwan aims to boost wind
power capacity to 980 MW by 2010, to 1,480 MW by 2015 and to 3,000 MW by 2025,
the CEPD said.</P>

      <P>U.S. beef and beef products are not expected to appear on tables at the nation's
military bases, at least not before the end of 2010, the Ministry of National
Defense (MND) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The MND recently signed contracts with suppliers of frozen beef from Australia
and New Zealand and those contracts will not expire until the end of 2010, said
MND spokesman Yu Sy-tue.</P>
      <P>"It means that the MND will not buy U.S. beef during that period," Yu said.</P>
      <P>The MND will continue to pay attention to the origin of meat products that are
served at military bases, which have a combined population of over 200,000
people, and will also carry out random inspection of meat products in
cooperation with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and other relevant government
agencies, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yang Chiu-hsing, magistrate of the southern county of Kaohsiung,
issued a directive Tuesday for the exclusion of U.S. ground beef and offal from
meals at the county's schools. The order came on the heels of a recent decision
by the central government to allow the importation of U.S. bone-in beef, offal,
ground beef and spinal cords with effect from next month.</P>
      <P>Yang also instructed Kaohsiung county government officials to make sure that
beef and beef products in restaurants and supermarket chain stores in Kaohsiung
County are properly labeled to show the country of origin.</P>
      <P>Yang dissuaded Kaohsiung residents from consuming U.S. bone-in beef, ground beef
and offal, saying this is a health precaution.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) announced Oct. 23 that Taiwan would
expand market access for U.S. beef, after officials of the two countries
clinched a protocol the previous day in Washington, D.C. to lift a partial ban
on U.S. beef imports.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the new protocol, U.S. bone-in beef, ground beef, intestines,
brains, spinal cords and processed beef, from cattle younger than 30 months and
which have not been contaminated with specific risk materials (SRMs), will be
allowed to enter Taiwan starting Nov. 10.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan only allows imports of U.S. boneless beef from cattle younger
than 30 months and which contain no SRMs.</P>
      <P>Yang said he hopes that the Legislative Yuan will vote against the DOH decision.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-chung, director of the Kaohsiung County Health Bureau, said the
United States was declared an affected area of bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE), or mad cow disease, in 2003 and the declaration has not been lifted
since.</P>
      <P>He said the BSE protein is difficult to detect and cannot be completely
destroyed by cooking. Ground beef, offal, brains and spinal cords are at high
risk for contamination with the BSE protein, he said.</P>
      <P>Mad cow disease has a long incubation period and infected patients usually shows
no symptoms in the initial stage, he said, adding that diagnosis could take
three or five years.</P>
      <P>"So far, the disease is incurable," he noted.</P>

      <P>Over 200 stores and restaurants in Taipei City have signed up for an alliance to
reject sales of U.S. beef offal, ground beef and spinal cords or their use as
ingredients, over health concerns, a city government official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Just a day after the Taipei City Office of Commerce initiated a plan to
encourage the city's 15,000 restaurants, supermarket chains, hotels and
department stores to form an alliance whose members will boycott the sale or use
of U.S. beef offal, ground beef and spinal cords, more than 200 stores had
already signed up, said Liu Chia-chun, director of the office.</P>
      <P>Liu said his office will accept applications between Nov. 11 and Dec. 31 by
these stores for an alliance badge they can display in their stores to indicate
that they do not supply or use U.S. beef offal, ground beef or spinal cords.</P>
      <P>If stores carrying the alliance badge are found to be selling or using these
products, they will be stripped of their certificates and fined in accordance
with the Consumers Protection Law, he said.</P>
      <P>Stores and restaurants that do not join the alliance will be checked randomly
and required to indicate on their packaging or menus the country of origin of
their beef, he continued.</P>
      <P>In related news, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-pin, who in a rare rebuke of the central
government the day before in which he voiced outright opposition to the
government's decision to allow imports of U.S. beef offal and ground beef, said
Tuesday that his opposition was not politically motivated.</P>
      <P>Hau said the city government's decision to boycott the protocol inked recently
by the Department of Health (DOH) with the U.S. on opening Taiwan's doors wider
to U.S. beef imports was made purely over health concerns.</P>
      <P>The mayor said he fully understands the dilemma that the government was facing
when it signed the protocol, but he agreed with a senior government official who
said recently that "opening the market does not mean that the government will
push sales."</P>
      <P>Hau said he supports the boycott drive simply because he is the mayor of Taipei
and responsible for overseeing the health of city residents and based on
professional knowledge that he learned as a student and professor of food
science and nutrition.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level DOH announced Oct. 23 that Taiwan would expand market access
to U.S. beef after officials clinched an accord the previous day in Washington,
D.C., to lift a partial ban on U.S. beef imports imposed after cases of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease were recorded there.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the new accord, U.S. bone-in beef, ground beef, intestines,
brains, spinal cords and processed beef from cattle younger than 30 months that
have not been contaminated with "specific risk materials" will be allowed to
enter Taiwan starting Nov. 10.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Prosecutors detain persons of interest in CPBL game-fixing case</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   27  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Six individuals  implicated in a professional  baseball  game-fixing  scandal
were detained  by prosecutors early Tuesday morning after being questioned in a
case that threaten's the future of Taiwan's Chinese Professional Baseball League
(CPBL).</P>
      <P>The individuals detained included the suspected ringleader of the suspected
gambling syndicate, bookmaker Tsai Cheng-yi, two former professional  baseball
players  believed  to have  served  as intermediaries with active players to get
them to fix games, and three others involved in Tsai's gambling operation.</P>
      <P>The two former players were identified as Chuang You-lin, who played for the
Brother Elephants, and Kevin Huang, a Boston Red Sox pitching prospect who
pitched briefly for the La New Bears in 2008 after he failed to make it to the
Major Leagues.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors are also expected on Wednesday to question eight active players
implicated in the case Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Six are members of the Brother Elephants -- pitchers Tsao Chin-hui, Liu Yu-chan,
Wu Bau-hsien, Wang Chin-li, and Li Hao-jen and catcher Wang Chun-tai -- and the
two others are both prominent players, power hitter Hsieh Chia-hsien of the
Sinon Bulls and pitcher Chuang Chih-chia of the La New Bears.</P>
      <P>Investigators also searched the residences of players from the three teams on
Monday. Only players from one of the four CPBL teams -- the Uni-President Lions
-- have yet to be implicated in the case.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice's Investigation Bureau said it had gathered evidence
indicating that the suspected players accepted cash payments to either throw
games on purpose or manipulate the score in at least nine regular season games
between May and September to allow Tsai's gambling syndicate to win bets.</P>
      <P>Local newspaper reports, citing investigative sources, indicated that starting
pitchers  were paid NT$3 million and relievers NT$500,000 to cooperate with the
scheme that was said to earn the Tsai and his cohorts over NT$100 million.</P>
      <P>Tsao, Taiwan's first pitcher to perform in the Major Leagues, adamantly denied
any involvement in the gambling scheme.  But conflicting media reports citing
investigators said that he met with Tsai on either one or multiple occasions.</P>
      <P>Having just completed its 20th season, the CPBL could face extinction if the
charges prove true.</P>
      <P>Reeling from a major gambling scandal in the mid-1990s that drove average
attendance from 6,878 at its peak in 1992 to a historical low of 1,676 in 2000,
the league had regained some momentum in the middle part of this decade after
Taiwan's national team performed well at the Baseball World Cup in 2001 and
competing professional leagues were merged in 2003.</P>
      <P>Average attendance peaked at 3,505 in 2004 but was then driven to below 2,000 in
2008 after gambling scandals erupted in 2005 and 2008.</P>
      <P>With the return to Taiwan of Tsao Chin-hui, who pitched for the Elephants, and
the streamlining of the CPBL to four established franchises in 2009, attendance
set a 13-year high at 3,742, but the investigation will only reinforce the
league's credibility problem.</P>
      <P>CPBL Secretary-General Wayne Lee and Elephants general manager Hung Rei-ho
expressed their disappointment Monday that prosecutors launched searches and
issued subpoenas without first notifying them.</P>
      <P>They demanded that judicial authorities provide evidence to back up their
suspicions,  fearful  that even if the charges  go unsubstantiated, the league
will suffer severe repercussions.</P>
      <P>Hung, however, reiterated a commitment he made last year to disband the team if
any players were proven to have engaged in game-fixing, an action that would
surely mean the end of the CPBL.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said Tuesday that Taiwan has applied
standards that are stricter than those of South Korea on U.S. beef imports and
denied that the government has taken a weaker stance on the issue.</P>
      <P>"The offers we were seeking while discussing the beef imports with the U.S. were
the same as or better than those sought by South Korea, " said Wang, in response
to a question from an opposition legislator.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, in a rare rebuke of the central government, Taipei Mayor Hau
Lung-pin voiced outright opposition to the government's decision to allow
imports of U.S. beef offal, ground beef and spinal cords, saying the city
government will take steps to boycott the decision by encouraging the city's
15,000 hotels, department stores, hypermarts and restaurants to form an alliance
whose members will reject sale of such products or their use as ingredients,
over health concerns.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the boycott plan, Wang said that if Hau and other local
governments are aiming to protect public health, "our stance is actually the
same."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee Ching-lung, former Minister of the Council of Agriculture (COA)
said Taiwan has been wrongly classified by the World Organization for Animal
Health (OIE) as a "controlled risk" country for bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE) , or mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has no mad cow disease, so should not be classified as a controlled risk
country just because it imports U.S. beef, " Lee said at a press conference held
by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Lee added that only 0.12 percent of U.S. cattle are screened for mad cow disease
before slaughter -- much lower than the rate of 33 percent in the European Union
and 100 percent in Japan.</P>
      <P>DPP whip Wang Hsing-nan said the DPP will propose that the government resume
talks with the U.S. on beef imports, and that all imports of U.S. beef products
should be approved by the Legislative Yuan before implementation.</P>
      <P>In addition, Control Yuan ombudsman Cheng Jen-hung said he will start an
investigation on his own accord into the government's decision to lift its
partial ban on U.S. beef imports.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) announced Oct. 23 that Taiwan would
expand market access for U.S. beef after officials of the two countries clinched
an accord the previous day in Washington, D.C., to lift the ban.</P>

brains, spinal cords and processed beef from cattle younger than 30 months that
have not been contaminated with " specific risk materials" will be allowed to
enter Taiwan starting Nov. 10.</P>
      <P>Specific risk materials are defined in the protocol as brains, skulls, eyes,
trigeminal ganglia, spinal cords, vertebral columns and dorsal root ganglia from
cattle 30 months of age and older, or tonsils and the distal ileum of the small
intestine from cattle of all ages.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan only allows imports of U.S. boneless beef from cattle younger
than 30 months that contain no such risky materials.</P>
      <P>The new market opening decision has drawn flak from opposition parties and

      <P>The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) touted the safety of U.S. beef Tuesday
after a recent Taiwan-U.S. agreement to open the Taiwan market wider to U.S.
beef imports sparked a bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or mad cow disease
scare among local consumers.</P>
      <P>William Stanton, director of the AIT's Taipei Office, told reporters that such
concern is unnecessary because the meat has been certified by the World
Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as safe to consume.</P>
      <P>While more than 50 countries and regions, including the European Union, South
Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines, have already established similar
liberalization protocols with the United States, nobody in any of those
countries have contracted Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease from eating U.S. beef,
Stanton said.</P>
      <P>Also, he continued, since 1997there have not been any cases of BSE recorded
among U.S. cattle, which totals more than 9.4 million head.</P>
      <P>According to Stanton, riding a motorcycle in Taiwan is much more dangerous than
eating U.S. beef, given the fact that 1,034 people died in motorcycle accidents
in 2008 alone.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the new accord, U.S. bone-in beef, ground beef, intestines,
brains, spinal cords and processed beef from cattle younger than 30 months that
have not been contaminated with "specific risk materials" will be allowed to
enter Taiwan starting Nov. 10.</P>
      <P>Specific risky materials are defined in the protocol as brains, skulls, eyes,
trigeminal ganglia, spinal cords, vertebral columns and dorsal root ganglia from
cattle 30 months of age and older, or tonsils and the distal ileum of the small
intestine from cattle of all ages.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan only allows imports of U.S. boneless beef from cattle younger
than 30 months that contain no such risky materials.</P>
      <P>The new market opening decision has drawn flak from opposition parties and
consumer rights activists.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile Tuesday, Wang Chun-chuan, director-general of the Department of
Physical Education under the Ministry of Education, said the ministry will not
encourage schools around the country to use U.S. beef when preparing meals for
students until its safety is certified by the health authorities, while
Kaohsiung Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing said schools in the county will be
forbidden from preparing meals with U.S. ground beef or offal.</P>
      <P>Yang also demanded that restaurants and supermarkets disclose the origin of
their beef products to allow consumers to make their own choices.</P>
      <P>Expressing strong opposition to the liberalization move, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-
bin a day earlier encouraged the city's 15,000 hotels, department stores,

      <P>The decision of Ma's administration to lift a six-year ban on imports of U.S.
bone-in beef, including risky offal and ground beef has shown that it is unable
to defend the country's interests.</P>
      <P>It bent to U.S. pressure in exchange for Washington's promise to resume long-

      <P>The Kuomintang has finally decided to elect the whole members of its Central
Standing Committee again, and mark the beginning of the party's first silent
revolution in history.</P>
      <P>We call it coup because the party chief negated the results of democratic
election because of vote-buying allegations and engineered a new election that
means he impose his personal will on the whole party.</P>
      <P>The coup has been successful thus far but it is uncertain that it will result in
a new lineup of the party policy makers who are clean, powerful and capable of
helping the party's governance.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, our government has not done enough to convince the public that
U.S. beef is safe for consumption.</P>
      <P>The health minister even gave the press a misleading briefing on the eve of the
conclusion of the agreement, claiming that beef offal and ground beef would be
excluded from the agreement, only to be exposed to the public with the discovery
that these items were also given a green light.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, Taiwan's people have risen up in arms, vowing to shield themselves
from risky beef offal. Several local government chiefs, notably Taipei Mayor Hau
Lung-bin, have urged restaurant owners in Taipei to refrain from selling the
controversial U.S. beef.</P>
      <P>It is a bright spot for democracy that the people can say "no" to Washington
when the government cannot.</P>

      <P>It is the fifth time in the league's 20-year history that it has been tarnished
by game-fixing allegations and may be the largest in terms of the number of
players involved.</P>
      <P>The allegations have disappointed fans, although the players involved could be
said to be more victims than sinners. They can be forgived for two reasons.</P>
      <P>They are paid far less than their U.S. and Japanese counterparts, leaving them
vulnerable to temptation, and they may have trouble saying no to bookmakers who
are often gangsters and are willing to use violence to get what they want.</P>
      <P>How can the vicious cycle be broken? It is not only up to team managements but
also law enforcement officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cross-strait meeting on logistics services opens in Taipei</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and China opened a two-day Conference on Cross-Strait Cooperation and
Exchange in the Logistics Services Industry in Taipei Tuesday, with the aim of
creating more business opportunities for both sides.</P>
      <P>The meeting, sponsored by the Taipei-based China Productivity Center, the
Institute for Information Industry (III) and the Taipei Computer Association
under a project initiated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) called
Building Bridges, has drawn more than 300 representatives and CEOs, including 40
from China.</P>
      <P>Chang Pen-tsao, chairman of the Taipei-based General Chamber of Commerce of the
R.O.C., and Hsu Chung-jen, general manager of the 7-11 convenience store chain,
are among the participants.</P>
      <P>During the first day of the conference, Lee Mei, deputy director of the MOEA's
Commerce Department, described the logistics services industry as one of
Taiwan's key sectors because its production value accounted for nearly 30
percent of the Gross Domestic Product last year. He predicted that the
industry's output will hit NT$1.5 trillion (US$46.3 billion) this year.</P>
      <P>"Through the conference, the MOEA hopes to build a bridge of communication for
companies of the two sides in one year and to forge business opportunities in
two years that will lead to cooperative ventures in the third year," Lee
explained.</P>
      <P>Kung Jen-wen, deputy CEO of the III, contended that it will be a "win-win"
situation if Taiwan can fully take advantage of China's large cyber-population
and its vast retail market to create new horizons for Taiwan's own retail,
e-commerce and logistics services.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is strong in e-commerce services such as online convenience
stores and online banks, Kung said the local market has become saturated due to
its small scale, while at present, the value of China's e-commerce market is
around NT$275 billion -- three times that of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Should Taiwan get the opportunity to apply its e-commerce experience and retail
sales expertise in the Chinese market, it would create a mutually beneficial
situation," he said.</P>
      <P>Both Chang and Hsu expressed optimism about the prospects for cross-strait
cooperation in online service businesses at a time when Taiwan is facing the
challenge of upgrading its service quality and the need to expand its scope into
fresh fields.</P>

    <HEADLINE>More extreme rainfall as a result of global warming predicted</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 27 (CNA)
10/27/09  18:16:56
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Academia Sinica researchers have published a study that shows the risk of
extreme rainfall due to global warming is substantially greater than estimated
in current climate models and that the situation is even graver in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Professor Shaw Chen Liu, director of Academia Sinica's Research Center for
Environmental Changes, and his research team published their findings in the
September issue of Geophysical Research Letters.</P>
      <P>The research paper states that for each degree Kelvin increase in global mean
temperature, the intensity of rain increases by about 110 percent for the top 10
percent heaviest rain, and decreases by about 20 percent for the bottom 40
percent lightest rain.</P>
      <P>The researchers found that the global average precipitation intensity increases
by about 23 percent per Kelvin of temperature change. This result is
qualitatively consistent with a recent hypothesis that precipitation intensity
would increase by more than the accepted 7 percent per Kelvin of water vapor
temperature rise because of the additional latent heat released from the
moisture.</P>
      <P>The findings in the Taiwan team's research show a far higher estimate than that
obtained from an ensemble of 17 latest generation climate models. The models
indicate an increase in precipitation intensity of only about 2 percent per
Kelvin of temperature change.</P>
      <P>Based on the observations of the researchers, as torrential rainfall gets
heavier and monsoons get lighter, there will be a sharp increase in the risk of
floods and mudslides, as well as more severe and frequent droughts.</P>
      <P>In a press release from Academia Sinica, Professor Liu points out that over the
last 45 years, the global temperature has increased by about 0.7 Kelvin,
implying that the top 10 percent area of precipitation intensity in Taiwan has
increased by about 100 percent and the bottom 20 percent of light precipitation
has decreased by about 50 percent.</P>
      <P>Since the global temperature is expected to increase by another 0.7 Kelvin in
the next 25 years, another round of similar changes can be expected, he adds.</P>
      <P>Predicting  higher risk of floods and mudslides and worse droughts, Liu suggests
that adaptation strategies, such as flood control, water resource policy and
land use plans, are urgently needed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECFA might exclude agricultural products from tariff concessions</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and China might not include agricultural products on a list of items that
will be subject to tariff concessions upon the signing of an economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA), officials and experts said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is concerned about the impact of opening to Chinese labor and
agricultural products, China is likely to respect Taiwan's requests that
agricultural products should be excluded from the list for tariff concessions,
the officials said while attending an economic seminar that ended the previous
day in the city of Chengdu in China's Sichuan Province.</P>
      <P>"So far during the discussions of the proposed economic pact, the Chinese side
has not only shown its understanding of and respect for most of Taiwan's
requests, it has even tried to agree to them, " said Pang Chien- kuo, a former
adviser to Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and a professor at Chinese
Culture University.</P>
      <P>Pang said the ECFA will not need to specify that Chinese agricultural products
cannot enter Taiwan, but merely exclude them from the list of items for which
tariff concessions will be allowed.</P>
      <P>Wang Yi, chief of the Taiwan Affairs Office of China's State Council, said China
understands Taiwan's difficulties, as opening its market to Chinese agricultural
products would have a great impact on Taiwan's own industries.</P>
      <P>Some Taiwanese business executives who attended the seminar also predicted that
China will not take action to boost Chinese labor exports to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hua Xiaohong, dean of the Institute for International Economics at China's
University of International Business and Economics, said the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait should think about how to balance the interests of both sides.</P>
      <P>She said China has adopted a positive attitude toward signing the ECFA and that
Chinese scholars and experts have also reached consensus on the issue.</P>
      <P>The seminar, sponsored by the Taipei-based Chung-Hua Institution for Economic
Research and a think tank under the Taiwan Affairs Office, drew senior economic
officials from Taiwan, including Deputy Economic Minister Hwang Jung-chiou, and
Council for Economic Planning and Development Vice Minister San Gee.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said a day earlier that Taiwan and
China will hold a fourth round of informal talks on the ECFA deal in Beijing
Nov. 3-4, during which they will touch on "early harvest" issues for the first
time.</P>
      <P>The "early harvest" lists refer to industries or services that each side will
open for immediate tariff concessions or more liberal trade terms under the
ECFA, similar to provisions under a free trade agreement.</P>
      <P>The government hopes to seal an ECFA agreement with China as soon as possible to
reduce the impact on Taiwanese businesses of the economic integration of China
and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which will come into
force next year.</P>

      <P>Chinese reporters assigned to Taiwan are to be allowed more flexibility in their
on-site news coverage and will no longer require to pre-register  their field
work with the Government Information Office, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Deputy Minister Chao Chien-min said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chao made the announcement prior to his departure for China with a group of
Taiwanese media representatives to visit media organizations there.</P>
      <P>At present, Chinese news organizations are permitted to send reporters across
the strait for special news coverage for a maximum period of three months each
time, a reciprocal measure that means Taiwanese news organizations can assign
reporters to China for the same period of time.</P>
      <P>The MAC official revealed that after detailed reviews by the relevant
authorities, the government has decided to allow Chinese reporters more
flexibility when they are assigned to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>While each Chinese news organization at present can only assign a team of two
reporters, in the future, up to five reporters working for the same organization
will be allowed to stay at the same time, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Elderly palanquin builder strives to keep craft alive</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/27/09  21:27:01</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wang Yung-chuan still works every day, despite the fact that he is 77 years old.
People passing by his home in an old mansion in Tainan City might take him for
just another elderly man trying to occupy his time. But Wang is in fact a master
craftsman in a highly specialized field.</P>
      <P>In the mansion on the intersection of Shennung and Haian streets in the southern
city's downtown area, he has a workshop where he makes palanquins.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, palanquins are used to carry the statues of Taoist gods in religious
parades and on pilgrimages.</P>
      <P>The sedan chairs, as they are also known, vary in size and are usually carried
by four to 12 male Taoist followers. They are essentially elaborate wooden
carriages on poles, and date back hundreds of years in Asia.</P>
      <P>Wang has been building these vehicles for 50 years.</P>
      <P>Although they are now being made commercially with the use of modern equipment
and techniques, there is still a market for the exquisite handcarved palanquins
that Wang turns out.</P>
      <P>In his hometown, some 80 percent of the local temples contain palanquins or
wooden sculptures made by Wang. He also receives orders for the chairs from
temples outside Tainan City.</P>
      <P>Wang began learning his craft at an early age. When he was 15, he started
working alongside his father, learning carpentry to help his family make a
living.</P>
      <P>A smart and diligent apprentice, he soon learned to make simple pieces such as
tables, cupboards, shelves and tool racks.</P>
      <P>By the 1970s he had acquired solid skills as a craftsman and a good reputation
in southern Taiwan and he began applying his expertise to the crafting of
palanquins.</P>
      <P>Within a decade, he had built a business that at its peak employed over 20
workers.</P>
      <P>"No matter how many orders were flowing in, my workers never dared to cut
corners to save time. They were required to pay strict attention to detail,
regardless of how busy they were," Wang said.</P>
      <P>This approach was observed throughout the entire process, from selection of the
materials to design and assembly of the pieces.</P>
      <P>These days, business is much slower. Wang gets about 10 orders per year and has
a team of some 10 craftsmen, including his son, his son-in-law and his grandson,
who work to fill the orders.</P>
      <P>Wang says he always uses the best quality Taiwanese camphor wood to make the
sedan chairs. He employs traditional techniques to build and carve them. Not a
single nail is used in the process. The pieces are fitted together by means of
precise joinery, and natural glue is used to secure them.</P>
      <P>"Treating  the wood with care and sticking to traditional techniques is a life-
long passion of mine," he said.</P>
      <P>The results of Wang's meticulousness and his adherence to his principles are
elaborate and exquisitely crafted works of art that are also sturdy and durable.</P>
      <P>"The palanquins must be able to bear the weight of the statues that they are
meant to carry, must be resistant to all sorts of weather, and at the same time
must be light enough and precisely balanced so that they could be carried
easily," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Amid the competition that he is now facing from China, Wang said, the key to
holding on to his niche is to maintain quality.</P>
      <P>"Although China-made wooden sculptures are rampant on the local market, we are
not afraid of the competition," he said. "We can stand out as long as our
products are of top quality."</P>
      <P>However, what concerns Wang is the possibility of traditional skills like his
dying. As master craftsmen like him grow older, the art of carving sedan chairs
by hand will also disappear, he fears.</P>
      <P>Some other famed master craftsmen in Tainan City who make sedan chairs were
taught by Wang.</P>
      <P>"I am fully prepared to pass on my skills to anyone who is willing to learn, "
he said.</P>
      <P>His family believes that the tradition of making palanquins, which was born
among the people, must be preserved and can take root again.</P>
      <P>"That belief is what keeps grandpa going," said his grandson.</P>
      <P>However, in addition, Wang finds satisfaction in doing something that has
brought him public recognition as well as personal joy.</P>
      <P>He has been selected as one of the 13 winners of this year's Global Chinese
Culture and Arts Award -- Taiwan's highest honor for outstanding achievements
across the arts spectrum.</P>
      <P>The award will be presented to him by the Ministry of Education Saturday in
Taipei County for his passion in preserving the palanquin art and his efforts to
pass on his skills to the younger generation.</P>
      <P>"It makes me really happy that I can keep working with a chisel and stay
connected to my craft," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officials said Tuesday that Taiwan would work
hard on participating in an East Asian trade bloc if such a body were to be
established, given the fact that the country plays a role in the global economy
and should not be excluded from such an economic grouping.</P>
      <P>Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama has recently proposed the concept of a
trade bloc called the East Asian Community (EAC) , modeled on the European
Union, to expand regional cooperation in trade, finance, currency and other
issues.</P>
      <P>Asked about Taiwan's opinion of the proposal, Charles T.H. Chen, secretary-
general of the MOFA's Association of East Asian Relations, said at a regular
press briefing that the bloc, if established, would benefit countries in the
region, including Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"If an EAC is established, Taiwan would hope to be part of it and would look for
ways to make contributions in the bloc. In principle, we very much welcome the
idea of forming an EAC," Chen said.</P>
      <P>However, MOFA spokesman Henry Chen said it is too early to talk about the issue,
as an EAC is only a concept at present. He added that it would be better to
express Taiwan's stance on the issue only after consensus is reached among the
governments in the region.</P>
      <P>The spokesman also said Taiwan's economic strength means it should not be
ignored in the establishment of an EAC, given that the country is the world's
18th-biggest  trading nation,  the 20th-largest economy and holds the world's
4th-largest foreign currency reserves.</P>
      <P>"It would be unreasonable to exclude Taiwan from an EAC and we would try our
best to become part of the trade bloc and to make contributions, to it," he
said.</P>

      <P>Five major beef importers and four leading foreign trade organizations vowed
Tuesday that "they will never import disputed U.S. beef products until public
concerns in this regard have been fully assuaged."</P>
      <P>The five importers announced in a news conference that they have decided to
stand by Taiwan's people because the health of the public is the foundation of
all commercial activities.</P>
      <P>"We will not import disputed parts such as cattle intestines or ground beef
before all the ripples arising from the issue have cleared, " said Huang Shih-
yen, a spokesman for the groups.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, Taiwan imported some 15,000 tons of beef for the whole of
last year, 7,000 tons of which came from the United States.</P>
      <P>"Consumer choice decides what we import into Taiwan, " he said, adding that the
government needs to clarify all related information to the public, as many local
consumers are gravely concerned about the safety of U.S. ground beef and beef
intestines in terms of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or mad cow
disease.</P>
      <P>Earlier that same day, four major foreign trade groups, including the Importers
and Exporters Association of Taipei and the Importers and Exporters Association
of Kaohsiung, issued a joint statement saying that they will not rush to import
those U.S. beef products when the ban is lifted.</P>
      <P>Out of concern for food safety, the four organizations said they will wait until
public misgivings in this regard are fully addressed and resolved.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health announced Oct. 23 that several types of
bone-in beef and offal from the United States will be allowed into Taiwan from
Nov. 10, sparking strong criticism from consumers and lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the new accord that Taiwan and the United States clinched a
day earlier in Washington, D.C. to lift a partial ban on U.S. beef imports, U.S.
bone-in beef, ground beef, intestines, brains, spinal cords and processed beef
from cattle younger than 30 months and that have not been contaminated with
"specific risk materials" will be permitted to enter Taiwan starting Nov. 10.</P>
      <P>Specific risk materials are defined in the protocol as brains, skulls, eyes,
trigeminal ganglia, spinal cords, vertebral columns and dorsal root ganglia from
cattle 30 months of age and older, or tonsils and the distal ileum of the small
intestine from cattle of all ages.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan only allows imports of U.S. boneless beef from cattle younger
than 30 months that contain no specified risk materials.</P>

      <P>Wu Chia-cheng, secretary-general of the Consumers' Foundation, called on
lawmakers and the public to boycott U.S. beef to force the government to reverse
its beef import policy.</P>
      <P>Noting the grave consequences of consuming beef contaminated with bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, Wu said the Consumers' Foundation
might appeal to Consumers International in the hope that this will pressure
Washington and Taipei into reversing the decision, which he described as

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Tuesday:</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>How can Ma's administration which bungles beef talks with Washington succeed in
trade talks with China?</P>
      <P>The decision of Ma's administration to lift a six-year ban on imports of U.S.
bone-in beef, including risky offal and ground beef has shown that it is unable
to defend the country's interests.</P>
      <P>It bent to U.S. pressure in exchange for Washington's promise to resume long-
stalled bilateral trade talks that are of insignificance to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It is reported that the decision was finalized by Ma and his national security
aides while the opinion of health officials were ignored.</P>
      <P>Judging from the administration's performance in talks with the U.S. we cannot
really hope for too much from it in its pending trade talks with China. So let's
cripple the president by ignoring his orders.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>KMT's coup has not yet completed, chairman has to push for it vigorously</P>
      <P>The Kuomintang has finally decided to elect the whole members of its Central
Standing Committee again, and mark the beginning of the party's first silent
revolution in history.</P>
      <P>We call it coup because the party chief negated the results of democratic
election because of vote-buying allegations and engineered a new election that
means he impose his personal will on the whole party.</P>
      <P>The coup has been successful thus far but it is uncertain that it will result in
a new lineup of the party policy makers who are clean, powerful and capable of
helping the party's governance.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the chairman has to continue to push for it and drive home the coup.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>U.S. beef and people's self-management</P>
      <P>The question of safety should be paramount when deciding whether or not imports
of U.S. bone-in beef should be permitted.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, our government has not done enough to convince the public that
U.S. beef is safe for consumption.</P>
      <P>The health minister even gave the press a misleading briefing on the eve of the
conclusion of the agreement, claiming that beef offal and ground beef would be
excluded from the agreement, only to be exposed to the public with the discovery
that these items were also given a green light.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, Taiwan's people have risen up in arms, vowing to shield themselves
from risky beef offal. Several local government chiefs, notably Taipei Mayor Hau
Lung-bin, have urged restaurant owners in Taipei to refrain from selling the
controversial U.S. beef.</P>
      <P>It is a bright spot for democracy that the people can say "no" to Washington
when the government cannot.</P>
      <P>Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>Baseball league beyond salvation</P>
      <P>Prosecutors raided the residences of several leading professional baseball
players in connection with a game-rigging scandal one day after the end of the
season's title game.</P>
      <P>It is the fifth time in the league's 20-year history that it has been tarnished
by game-fixing allegations and may be the largest in terms of the number of
players involved.</P>
      <P>The allegations have disappointed fans, although the players involved could be
said to be more victims than sinners. They can be forgived for two reasons.</P>
      <P>They are paid far less than their U.S. and Japanese counterparts, leaving them
vulnerable to temptation, and they may have trouble saying no to bookmakers who
are often gangsters and are willing to use violence to get what they want.</P>
      <P>How can the vicious cycle be broken? It is not only up to team managements but
also law enforcement officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cross-strait meeting on logistics services opens in Taipei</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  27  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and China opened a two-day Conference on Cross-Strait Cooperation and
Exchange in the Logistics Services Industry in Taipei Tuesday, with the aim of
creating more business opportunities for both sides.</P>
      <P>The meeting, sponsored by the Taipei-based China Productivity Center, the
Institute for Information Industry (III) and the Taipei Computer Association
under a project initiated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) called
Building Bridges, has drawn more than 300 representatives and CEOs, including 40
from China.</P>
      <P>Chang Pen-tsao, chairman of the Taipei-based General Chamber of Commerce of the
R.O.C., and Hsu Chung-jen, general manager of the 7-11 convenience store chain,
are among the participants.</P>
      <P>During the first day of the conference, Lee Mei, deputy director of the MOEA's
Commerce Department, described the logistics services industry as one of
Taiwan's key sectors because its production value accounted for nearly 30
percent of the Gross Domestic Product last year. He predicted that the
industry's output will hit NT$1.5 trillion (US$46.3 billion) this year.</P>
      <P>"Through the conference, the MOEA hopes to build a bridge of communication for
companies of the two sides in one year and to forge business opportunities in
two years that will lead to cooperative ventures in the third year," Lee
explained.</P>
      <P>Kung Jen-wen, deputy CEO of the III, contended that it will be a "win-win"
situation if Taiwan can fully take advantage of China's large cyber-population
and its vast retail market to create new horizons for Taiwan's own retail,
e-commerce and logistics services.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is strong in e-commerce services such as online convenience
stores and online banks, Kung said the local market has become saturated due to
its small scale, while at present, the value of China's e-commerce market is
around NT$275 billion -- three times that of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Should Taiwan get the opportunity to apply its e-commerce experience and retail
sales expertise in the Chinese market, it would create a mutually beneficial
situation," he said.</P>
      <P>Both Chang and Hsu expressed optimism about the prospects for cross-strait
cooperation in online service businesses at a time when Taiwan is facing the
challenge of upgrading its service quality and the need to expand its scope into
fresh fields.</P>

    <HEADLINE>More extreme rainfall as a result of global warming predicted</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 27 (CNA)
10/27/09  18:16:56
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Academia Sinica researchers have published a study that shows the risk of
extreme rainfall due to global warming is substantially greater than estimated
in current climate models and that the situation is even graver in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Professor Shaw Chen Liu, director of Academia Sinica's Research Center for
Environmental Changes, and his research team published their findings in the
September issue of Geophysical Research Letters.</P>
      <P>The research paper states that for each degree Kelvin increase in global mean
temperature, the intensity of rain increases by about 110 percent for the top 10
percent heaviest rain, and decreases by about 20 percent for the bottom 40
percent lightest rain.</P>
      <P>The researchers found that the global average precipitation intensity increases
by about 23 percent per Kelvin of temperature change. This result is
qualitatively consistent with a recent hypothesis that precipitation intensity
would increase by more than the accepted 7 percent per Kelvin of water vapor
temperature rise because of the additional latent heat released from the
moisture.</P>
      <P>The findings in the Taiwan team's research show a far higher estimate than that
obtained from an ensemble of 17 latest generation climate models. The models
indicate an increase in precipitation intensity of only about 2 percent per
Kelvin of temperature change.</P>
      <P>Based on the observations of the researchers, as torrential rainfall gets
heavier and monsoons get lighter, there will be a sharp increase in the risk of
floods and mudslides, as well as more severe and frequent droughts.</P>
      <P>In a press release from Academia Sinica, Professor Liu points out that over the
last 45 years, the global temperature has increased by about 0.7 Kelvin,
implying that the top 10 percent area of precipitation intensity in Taiwan has
increased by about 100 percent and the bottom 20 percent of light precipitation
has decreased by about 50 percent.</P>
      <P>Since the global temperature is expected to increase by another 0.7 Kelvin in
the next 25 years, another round of similar changes can be expected, he adds.</P>
      <P>Predicting  higher risk of floods and mudslides and worse droughts, Liu suggests
that adaptation strategies, such as flood control, water resource policy and
land use plans, are urgently needed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECFA might exclude agricultural products from tariff concessions</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and China might not include agricultural products on a list of items that
will be subject to tariff concessions upon the signing of an economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA), officials and experts said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is concerned about the impact of opening to Chinese labor and
agricultural products, China is likely to respect Taiwan's requests that
agricultural products should be excluded from the list for tariff concessions,
the officials said while attending an economic seminar that ended the previous
day in the city of Chengdu in China's Sichuan Province.</P>
      <P>"So far during the discussions of the proposed economic pact, the Chinese side
has not only shown its understanding of and respect for most of Taiwan's
requests, it has even tried to agree to them, " said Pang Chien- kuo, a former
adviser to Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and a professor at Chinese
Culture University.</P>
      <P>Pang said the ECFA will not need to specify that Chinese agricultural products
cannot enter Taiwan, but merely exclude them from the list of items for which
tariff concessions will be allowed.</P>
      <P>Wang Yi, chief of the Taiwan Affairs Office of China's State Council, said China
understands Taiwan's difficulties, as opening its market to Chinese agricultural
products would have a great impact on Taiwan's own industries.</P>
      <P>Some Taiwanese business executives who attended the seminar also predicted that
China will not take action to boost Chinese labor exports to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hua Xiaohong, dean of the Institute for International Economics at China's
University of International Business and Economics, said the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait should think about how to balance the interests of both sides.</P>
      <P>She said China has adopted a positive attitude toward signing the ECFA and that
Chinese scholars and experts have also reached consensus on the issue.</P>
      <P>The seminar, sponsored by the Taipei-based Chung-Hua Institution for Economic
Research and a think tank under the Taiwan Affairs Office, drew senior economic
officials from Taiwan, including Deputy Economic Minister Hwang Jung-chiou, and
Council for Economic Planning and Development Vice Minister San Gee.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said a day earlier that Taiwan and
China will hold a fourth round of informal talks on the ECFA deal in Beijing
Nov. 3-4, during which they will touch on "early harvest" issues for the first
time.</P>
      <P>The "early harvest" lists refer to industries or services that each side will
open for immediate tariff concessions or more liberal trade terms under the
ECFA, similar to provisions under a free trade agreement.</P>
      <P>The government hopes to seal an ECFA agreement with China as soon as possible to
reduce the impact on Taiwanese businesses of the economic integration of China
and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which will come into
force next year.</P>

      <P>Chinese reporters assigned to Taiwan are to be allowed more flexibility in their
on-site news coverage and will no longer require to pre-register  their field
work with the Government Information Office, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Deputy Minister Chao Chien-min said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chao made the announcement prior to his departure for China with a group of
Taiwanese media representatives to visit media organizations there.</P>
      <P>At present, Chinese news organizations are permitted to send reporters across
the strait for special news coverage for a maximum period of three months each
time, a reciprocal measure that means Taiwanese news organizations can assign
reporters to China for the same period of time.</P>
      <P>The MAC official revealed that after detailed reviews by the relevant
authorities, the government has decided to allow Chinese reporters more
flexibility when they are assigned to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>While each Chinese news organization at present can only assign a team of two
reporters, in the future, up to five reporters working for the same organization
will be allowed to stay at the same time, he added.</P>

      <P>The United States' top envoy to Taiwan said Tuesday that the U.S. supports
Taiwan's "meaningful participation" in U.N. specialized agencies and expects
better bilateral relations between America and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>William Stanton, director of the American Institute in Taiwan, reiterated that
the U.S. will continue to adhere to the terms of the Taiwan Relations Act and on
cross-Taiwan Strait issues, will respect Taiwan's attitude toward China.</P>
      <P>Stanton, who assumed office two months ago, make the remarks in a speech on
U.S.-Taiwan Relations at National Chengchi University's Institute of
International Relations.</P>
      <P>Following Taiwan's success in its bid to attend the World Health Assembly -- the
World Health Organization's decision-making body -- as an observer for the first
time in May this year, the government has recently announced that the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the International Civil
Aviation Organization will be the country's next targets for "meaningful
participation" in U.N. specialized agencies.</P>
      <P>Stanton said the U.S. backs President Ma Ying-jeou's "modus vivendi" diplomatic
strategy, which favors a moderate and pragmatic approach.</P>
      <P>He said the U.S. also supports Taiwan's efforts to provide professional advice
in specialized fields and make a contribution on reducing greenhouse gas and
carbon emissions.</P>
      <P>Stanton added that U.S.-Taiwan relations will be strengthened as mutual
exchanges  between  non-profit  organizations,  academic institutions, think
tanks and youth groups will help more people understand Taiwan and experience
the warmth of the Taiwanese people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Elderly palanquin builder strives to keep craft alive</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/27/09  21:27:01</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wang Yung-chuan still works every day, despite the fact that he is 77 years old.
People passing by his home in an old mansion in Tainan City might take him for
just another elderly man trying to occupy his time. But Wang is in fact a master
craftsman in a highly specialized field.</P>
      <P>In the mansion on the intersection of Shennung and Haian streets in the southern
city's downtown area, he has a workshop where he makes palanquins.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, palanquins are used to carry the statues of Taoist gods in religious
parades and on pilgrimages.</P>
      <P>The sedan chairs, as they are also known, vary in size and are usually carried
by four to 12 male Taoist followers. They are essentially elaborate wooden
carriages on poles, and date back hundreds of years in Asia.</P>
      <P>Wang has been building these vehicles for 50 years.</P>
      <P>Although they are now being made commercially with the use of modern equipment
and techniques, there is still a market for the exquisite handcarved palanquins
that Wang turns out.</P>
      <P>In his hometown, some 80 percent of the local temples contain palanquins or
wooden sculptures made by Wang. He also receives orders for the chairs from
temples outside Tainan City.</P>
      <P>Wang began learning his craft at an early age. When he was 15, he started
working alongside his father, learning carpentry to help his family make a
living.</P>
      <P>A smart and diligent apprentice, he soon learned to make simple pieces such as
tables, cupboards, shelves and tool racks.</P>
      <P>By the 1970s he had acquired solid skills as a craftsman and a good reputation
in southern Taiwan and he began applying his expertise to the crafting of
palanquins.</P>
      <P>Within a decade, he had built a business that at its peak employed over 20
workers.</P>
      <P>"No matter how many orders were flowing in, my workers never dared to cut
corners to save time. They were required to pay strict attention to detail,
regardless of how busy they were," Wang said.</P>
      <P>This approach was observed throughout the entire process, from selection of the
materials to design and assembly of the pieces.</P>
      <P>These days, business is much slower. Wang gets about 10 orders per year and has
a team of some 10 craftsmen, including his son, his son-in-law and his grandson,
who work to fill the orders.</P>
      <P>Wang says he always uses the best quality Taiwanese camphor wood to make the
sedan chairs. He employs traditional techniques to build and carve them. Not a
single nail is used in the process. The pieces are fitted together by means of
precise joinery, and natural glue is used to secure them.</P>
      <P>"Treating  the wood with care and sticking to traditional techniques is a life-
long passion of mine," he said.</P>
      <P>The results of Wang's meticulousness and his adherence to his principles are
elaborate and exquisitely crafted works of art that are also sturdy and durable.</P>
      <P>"The palanquins must be able to bear the weight of the statues that they are
meant to carry, must be resistant to all sorts of weather, and at the same time
must be light enough and precisely balanced so that they could be carried
easily," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Amid the competition that he is now facing from China, Wang said, the key to
holding on to his niche is to maintain quality.</P>
      <P>"Although China-made wooden sculptures are rampant on the local market, we are
not afraid of the competition," he said. "We can stand out as long as our
products are of top quality."</P>
      <P>However, what concerns Wang is the possibility of traditional skills like his
dying. As master craftsmen like him grow older, the art of carving sedan chairs
by hand will also disappear, he fears.</P>
      <P>Some other famed master craftsmen in Tainan City who make sedan chairs were
taught by Wang.</P>
      <P>"I am fully prepared to pass on my skills to anyone who is willing to learn, "
he said.</P>
      <P>His family believes that the tradition of making palanquins, which was born
among the people, must be preserved and can take root again.</P>
      <P>"That belief is what keeps grandpa going," said his grandson.</P>
      <P>However, in addition, Wang finds satisfaction in doing something that has
brought him public recognition as well as personal joy.</P>
      <P>He has been selected as one of the 13 winners of this year's Global Chinese
Culture and Arts Award -- Taiwan's highest honor for outstanding achievements
across the arts spectrum.</P>
      <P>The award will be presented to him by the Ministry of Education Saturday in
Taipei County for his passion in preserving the palanquin art and his efforts to
pass on his skills to the younger generation.</P>
      <P>"It makes me really happy that I can keep working with a chisel and stay
connected to my craft," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan would work to join East Asian bloc: Foreign Ministry</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  27  (CNA)
10/27/09  21:58:34
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officials said Tuesday that Taiwan would work
hard on participating in an East Asian trade bloc if such a body were to be
established, given the fact that the country plays a role in the global economy
and should not be excluded from such an economic grouping.</P>
      <P>Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama has recently proposed the concept of a
trade bloc called the East Asian Community (EAC) , modeled on the European
Union, to expand regional cooperation in trade, finance, currency and other
issues.</P>
      <P>Asked about Taiwan's opinion of the proposal, Charles T.H. Chen, secretary-
general of the MOFA's Association of East Asian Relations, said at a regular
press briefing that the bloc, if established, would benefit countries in the
region, including Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"If an EAC is established, Taiwan would hope to be part of it and would look for
ways to make contributions in the bloc. In principle, we very much welcome the
idea of forming an EAC," Chen said.</P>
      <P>However, MOFA spokesman Henry Chen said it is too early to talk about the issue,
as an EAC is only a concept at present. He added that it would be better to
express Taiwan's stance on the issue only after consensus is reached among the
governments in the region.</P>
      <P>The spokesman also said Taiwan's economic strength means it should not be
ignored in the establishment of an EAC, given that the country is the world's
18th-biggest  trading nation,  the 20th-largest economy and holds the world's
4th-largest foreign currency reserves.</P>
      <P>"It would be unreasonable to exclude Taiwan from an EAC and we would try our
best to become part of the trade bloc and to make contributions, to it," he
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Five major beef importers and four leading foreign trade organizations vowed
Tuesday that "they will never import disputed U.S. beef products until public
concerns in this regard have been fully assuaged."</P>
      <P>The five importers announced in a news conference that they have decided to
stand by Taiwan's people because the health of the public is the foundation of
all commercial activities.</P>
      <P>"We will not import disputed parts such as cattle intestines or ground beef
before all the ripples arising from the issue have cleared, " said Huang Shih-
yen, a spokesman for the groups.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, Taiwan imported some 15,000 tons of beef for the whole of
last year, 7,000 tons of which came from the United States.</P>
      <P>"Consumer choice decides what we import into Taiwan, " he said, adding that the
government needs to clarify all related information to the public, as many local
consumers are gravely concerned about the safety of U.S. ground beef and beef
intestines in terms of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or mad cow
disease.</P>
      <P>Earlier that same day, four major foreign trade groups, including the Importers
and Exporters Association of Taipei and the Importers and Exporters Association
of Kaohsiung, issued a joint statement saying that they will not rush to import
those U.S. beef products when the ban is lifted.</P>
      <P>Out of concern for food safety, the four organizations said they will wait until

    <TEXT>
      <P>Five major beef importers and four leading foreign trade organizations vowed
Tuesday that "they will never import disputed U.S. beef products until public
concerns in this regard have been fully assuaged."</P>
      <P>The five importers announced in a news conference that they have decided to
stand by Taiwan's people because the health of the public is the foundation of
all commercial activities.</P>
      <P>"We will not import disputed parts such as cattle intestines or ground beef
before all the ripples arising from the issue have cleared, " said Huang Shih-
yen, a spokesman for the groups.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, Taiwan imported some 15,000 tons of beef for the whole of
last year, 7,000 tons of which came from the United States.</P>
      <P>"Consumer choice decides what we import into Taiwan, " he said, adding that the
government needs to clarify all related information to the public, as many local
consumers are gravely concerned about the safety of U.S. ground beef and beef
intestines in terms of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or mad cow
disease.</P>
      <P>Earlier that same day, four major foreign trade groups, including the Importers
and Exporters Association of Taipei and the Importers and Exporters Association
of Kaohsiung, issued a joint statement saying that they will not rush to import
those U.S. beef products when the ban is lifted.</P>
      <P>Out of concern for food safety, the four organizations said they will wait until
public misgivings in this regard are fully addressed and resolved.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health announced Oct. 23 that several types of
bone-in beef and offal from the United States will be allowed into Taiwan from

    <HEADLINE>President urges Australia to upgrade ties with Taiwan</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Sydney,  Oct. 28 (CNA)
10/28/09  12:17:00
(By Derek Chen and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has urged Australia to strengthen its substantive
relations with Taiwan in light of improved ties across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Raising the issue in a recent interview with The Australian newspaper, Ma said
Taiwan's peaceful engagement with China over the past 18 months since his
inauguration "has changed history, not just of this country but of this region."</P>
      <P>"If Beijing is willing to improve relations with us, why couldn't Australia?" Ma
asked.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan's past competition  with China for diplomatic partners among
Pacific nations led to a worsening of relations with Australia, Ma told the
newspaper that there is now "some kind of tacit understanding" between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait on a diplomatic truce.</P>
      <P>"So given the changed circumstances, I'm sure Canberra should have a new policy
-- not in the sense of changing its previous one-China policy, but to enhance
the substantive relationship with Taiwan, of trade and investment, education and
tourism," he said.</P>
      <P>The president expressed support for Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's
initiative for the formation of an "Asia-Pacific community" by 2020 and said he
hopes Taiwan could also be included in the regional organization.</P>
      <P>Also, Ma said he looks forward to meeting Rudd and receiving more visits from
officials in Rudd's Cabinet.</P>
      <P>The content of the interview  was published Tuesday in a commentary titled
"We've left Taiwan out in the cold" written by Rowan Callick, Asia-Pacific
editor of the newspapar.</P>
      <P>Callick wrote that the question raised by Ma is "fair."</P>
      <P>Callick noted that Taiwan is one of the few countries that Australia has not
approached when lobbying for regional support for Rudd's vision, although Taiwan
has a slightly higher population than Australia and is Australia's eight-largest
export market.</P>
      <P>"If China can engage so fully with Taiwan -- in business, tourism, education and
culture -- why should Australians remain so coy, leaving aside the necessity to
observe the usual diplomatic niceties?" Callick questioned, echoing Ma's call.</P>

10/28/09  13:25:48
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials
Wednesday:</P>
      <P>UNITED DAILY NEWS:</P>
      <P>U.S. beef imports flap: Taipei mayor and McDonald's</P>
      <P>There are two things that are inspiring after the recent flap over the easing of
import restrictions on U.S. beef.</P>
      <P>The first one is Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin's campaign to encourage the city's
15,000 hotels, department stores, hypermarts and restaurants to form an alliance
whose members will reject the sales of U.S. beef offal, ground beef and spinal
cords or their use as ingredients over health concerns.</P>
      <P>The other is the announcement by U.S. fast food chain McDonald's that it will
not use U.S. beef.</P>
      <P>We regret the Ma administration's lack of skill and communication in announcing
its decision on an issue as important and sensitive as U.S. beef imports.</P>
      <P>Has the administration's rhetoric over the past few days assured the public on
the safety of imported U.S. beef?</P>
      <P>Hau and McDonald's have reflected the public's feelings in their latest moves,
and the Ma administration should be ashamed of itself for its lack of
sensitivity and failing in its duty.</P>
      <P>CHINA TIMES:</P>
      <P>Look at ECFA from broad, economic perspective</P>
      <P>Following an estimate by China's Ministry of Commerce that the signing of an
economic cooperation framework agreement with Taiwan would provide it with
greater economic  benefits than Taiwan, opposition against signing such an
agreement is again mounting.</P>
      <P>The reason for signing such a pact is obvious. The ASEAN plus one (China) free
trade zone, to take effect on Jan. 1, 2010, will form the world's largest free
trade zone in which tariffs for almost all goods moving within the zone will be
reduced to zero.</P>
      <P>Excluded from the block, Taiwan's products will be subject to higher tariffs
when exported to the countries in the block.</P>
      <P>Some might wonder why Taiwan does not ink a free trade agreement (FTA) with the
countries in the group to achieve the same purpose of avoiding marginalization.</P>
      <P>But Taiwan has been unable to persuade other countries to do so due to political
realities. In fact, some are waiting to see Taiwan ink an ECFA with China before
agreeing to an FTA.</P>
      <P>From a broader perspective, Taiwan cannot postpone signing the agreement any
longer.</P>
      <P>Some have opposed the pact, citing China's estimate that the deal would boost
China's gross domestic product (GDP) by US$27 billion and Taiwan's GDP by US$6.9
billion.</P>
      <P>This is an unworthy fallacy, because Taiwan benefits from such an agreement, and
without it, its GDP could fall and unemployment could increase.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the figures should be seen in the context of economic scale. The pact
will help Taiwan's GDP grow by 1.72 percentage points, compared to only 0.63
percent for China.</P>
      <P>APPLE DAILY: Central Committee and Central Standing Committee should be
disbanded</P>
      <P>If the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou has the determination to
persuade the party to hold a re-election of its Central Standing Committee (CSC)
members, why not eliminate Central Committee and Central Standing Committee
members altogether.</P>
      <P>Such a move will save the party the trouble of a re-election, make the relation
between the Cabinet and the party simple, and even have the party lead the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in becoming an internally
democratic party.</P>
      <P>Some who are concerned about the development of the KMT have recently made
numerous suggestions on the CSC election.</P>
      <P>But we think a re-election in the wake of reported rampant vote-buying could
only be staged once. If the same senario repeats itself, it will become a farce.</P>
      <P>Simplifying party affairs is the inevitable trend of a democratic political
party.</P>
      <P>On the way toward a democratic party, the Central Committee or CSC members of
both the KMT and DPP have become positions offered to return a favor. If the
positions have lost their real functions, why not phase them out?</P>
      <P>LIBERTY TIMES: Does President Ma have any credibility left after CSC election?</P>
      <P>A week ago, the governing Kuomintang (KMT) invalidated the election of two
Central Standing Committee members over vote-buying. The incident led to the
mass resignation of committee's elected member and eventually a full by-
election.</P>
      <P>Ma said such a by-election was a grave matter, as it had never occurred since
the party was established or elections of CSC members were first held.</P>
      <P>Chairman Ma has used "party reform" as a mantra, but the by-election has
highlighted one truth: the internal corruption of the party.</P>
      <P>Some who had been elected as CSC members said they tendered their resignation to
"implement Ma's will, " but what is Ma's will? In a nutshell, he is trying hard
to project an "integrity" image.</P>
      <P>If there was a stain in the CSC election, he would rather have a new election to
go with the image he is trying to project.</P>
      <P>We would like to remind Ma the problems he faces are not just his image, but the
nation's welfare. Even if the re-election will restore some of his image, if he
continues to act headstrong on matters such as relaxing restrictions on U.S.
beef imports, or stick to his China-leaning policy, then he will be taught a
lesson in the year-end elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Family organic food business struggles to make comeback</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/28/09  14:35:41</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>When Lin Chung-chih and his wife decided 14 years ago to go into organic
farming, neither of them had any experience in the field. He was a new
Industrial Design graduate and she was an art and design worker.</P>
      <P>They started by leasing 0.6 hectares of land in Chiali, Tainan County and
borrowing NT$500,000. Then Lin and Shih Na-li, better known as Tomo and Nono,
set about learning the business of organic farming from the ground up.</P>
      <P>"Because we had never worked on a farm before, we had to start from scratch to
learn about agriculture, and had to do so in very short time," Lin said.</P>
      <P>They spent the first year on the farm experimenting with various exotic crops in
an effort to find those that were best suited to local conditions. They did all
the manual work themselves and sought the advice of experts from several
agricultural research institutes and improvement stations.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Chun-shi of the Council of Agriculture, one of the main
concerns for organic farmers is that the work is more time consuming and the
yield is less than if conventional farming practices are used.</P>
      <P>Another major challenge is pest control, as pests thrive in Taiwan' s hot humid
summers and its winters are not cold enough to stop the proliferation of
insects.</P>
      <P>"Under  normal conditions,  only one third of the organic vegetables planted are
harvested. The rest of the crop is more often than not destroyed by insects, and
if the weather is unfavorable, there is usually nothing left to harvest," Tomo
confirmed.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, Tomo and Nono gradually acquired expertise in growing organic
crops. But they soon faced another challenge, as they had to apply their minds
to the business of selling their produce in an uncertain market.</P>
      <P>In 1996, there were 160 hectares of land organically farmed in Taiwan. By 2008,
nearly 1,000 households in the country had become involved in organic farming,
and 2,386 hectares, or less than 1 percent of the nation's farmlands, were
dedicated to organic crops, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>Tomo and Nono, who were trying to break into the business in the late 1990s, had
to first assess the market.</P>
      <P>"I conducted a market survey and we forged partnerships with department stores,
supermarkets and hypermarkets that agreed to distribute our produce," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Within a few years, the couple had gained a reputation as expert growers of
organic vegetables, and the business, which they called Genki Home, had earned
profits of NT$10 million.</P>
      <P>Having gained momentum, Tomo and Nono decided to expand the business by buying
the land they were farming and leasing other plots close by.</P>
      <P>They also contracted some of the cultivation to other farmers in an effort to
meet the growing demand for their organic vegetables, and that's when the
trouble started for Genki Home.</P>
      <P>A batch of vegetables grown by the contract farmers was found to contain
pesticide residues and this led to a series of returns and cancellation of
orders.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, when farmers decide to shift to organic farming, they have to
let their fields lie fallow for three years in order to get rid of the chemicals
in the soil.</P>
      <P>The crops are then planted and fertilized with natural organic fertilizers such
as soybean residue, grain powder, and rice bran, he said. There is no use of
pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, or genetically modified organisms, he added.</P>
      <P>In the case of Genki Home, pesticides had probably leeched from nearby plots
into the soil on the land that the contract farmers in northern Taiwan used to
plant the vegetables, Tomo said.</P>
      <P>However, he added, he also questioned the methods used by the relevant agencies
and consumers' groups to detect the pesticide levels in the products.</P>
      <P>Because of the blow to its reputation, Genki Home suffered losses amounting to
NT$20 million. Tomo and Nono were forced to sell their farm machinery and food
production  equipment to offset their deficits.</P>
      <P>"We had worked so hard in the business for nine years, and suddenly everything
was gone," Tomo said.</P>
      <P>However, with the encouragement of their friends and reaffirming their
dedication to eco-friendly agriculture, Tomo and Nono soon decided to try to
revive the business.</P>
      <P>"Food grown without intensive use of synthetic chemicals is better for people's
health and the environment, " Tomo said."We decided to stay in the business,
despite the huge amount of money we had lost."</P>
      <P>Amid growing competition from other organic food companies owned by big
businesses, Genki Home has adopted a strategy of diversifying into products such
as colorful vegetables rarely seen in Taiwan, and it now contracts cultivation
only to reputable farmers.</P>
      <P>On their small holding, Tomo and Nono grow green vegetables, red- and-white
radishes, cherry tomatoes, fennel, purple broccoli, leek, and oakleaf lettuce,
which are all hugely popular among health conscious consumers.</P>
      <P>Nono set up a blog site on which she posts photos  and descriptions of their
produce and recipes that feature organic products. In the two years since it was
launched, the site has had 370,000 hits and has won an award.</P>
      <P>A year ago, Nono began organizing camps that offer people the opportunity to
gain farming experience and she has been distributing free organic food samples
at department stores in Taipei, Tainan and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>"We're just trying to keep our farm viable, find our niche and use direct
marketing to convince our customers that we are supplying them with safe healthy
products from a clean wholesome environment, " Tomo said.</P>
      <P>The company is still struggling to make ends meet because sales are shrinking in
the wake of several typhoons and amid the economic downturn, according to Nono.</P>
      <P>"Consumers are reluctant to pay the premium prices associated with many organic
products," she said.</P>
      <P>However, Genki Home will continue its struggle to bring to the market food
products that are healthy and free from chemicals, the couple said.</P>
      <P>"Once our customers like what we supply, we know we're on the right track," Tomo
said.</P>
      <P>He thinks that sticking to pesticide-free farming is "a matter of conscience"
and sees organic farming as much more than just a means of earning a living.</P>
      <P>"In our use of the land, we need to love it and protect it, " he said. "We also
need to instill environmentally friendly habits in our children and let them
know that organic farmers are guardians of the earth because this type of
farming helps to restore the land."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Number of 'National Day' birds passing through Kenting sets record</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Pingtung, Oct. 28 (CNA)
10/28/09  15:03:31
(By Kuo Chih-hsuan and Fanny Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 50,000 gray-faced buzzard eagles have passed through southern Taiwan's
Kenting National Park this year, the most since their numbers were first
recorded 20 years ago, as environmental education and controls on illegal
hunting have taken hold.</P>
      <P>Tsai Yi-jung, a senior technician who worked in Kenting National Park for 25
years, said the number gray-faced buzzard eagles passing through the park on
their migration routes has grown threefold in the past decade, and after
reaching 43,515 in 2008 and 49,600 in 2009 is likely to break 50,000 next year.</P>
      <P>Gray-faced buzzard eagles, also known as the "National Day Bird," are listed in
Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
(CITES) , which includes species for which trade must be controlled to "avoid
utilization incompatible with their survival."</P>
      <P>The number of gray-faced buzzards stopping in Kenting has grown by about 3,000
per year since 1998, said Tsai, who attributed the growth in part to the support
of local police in investigating and controlling illegal hunting.</P>
      <P>"Since the Pingtung District Prosecutors Office began asking local police
departments to supplement efforts by park police in strengthening the
investigation and arrest of illegal hunters of the birds seven years ago, the
situation has really changed, " Tsai asserted.</P>
      <P>Four cases of illegal hunting of gray-faced buzzards have been reported so far
this year, according to local police.</P>
      <P>Tsai also noted that as police have cracked down on illegal hunting of the
species, its selling price has reached NT$1,000 to NT$1,200, more than double
the NT$300 to NT$500 the bird fetched more than a decade ago.</P>
      <P>This rare species of migratory bird may be the most famous of 200 bird species
that transit through Kenting National Park every year as they migrate, and
because its migration period usually comes around Oct. 10, Taiwan's national
day, it is nicknamed the "National Day Bird."</P>
      <P>Gray-faced buzzards usually rest in Kenting for about 20 days from early to mid-
October and can be seen flying in groups above the ocean.</P>
      <P>Kenting National Park holds an annual eagle-watching event that includes
various  bird-watching  and  environmental  education activities.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Following the dispute arising from the government's decision to allow imports of
U.S. bone-in beef and offal to Taiwan, new concern that genetically modified
U.S. rice might be next to gain permission to enter Taiwan prompted a denial
from the head of the Council of Agriculture (COA) Wednesday.</P>
      <P>COA Minister Chen Wu-hsiung issued the denial to reporters following a news
report the previous night that quoted an official of the Department of Health
(DOH) as saying that Taiwan is ready to open its market to genetically
engineered rice from the United States.</P>
      <P>"The COA will not take the liberalization measure that would allow such rice
from the United States to enter Taiwan, " Chen said, adding that "I will step
down if imports of U.S. genetically engineered rice are permitted."</P>
      <P>"The COA has `absolutely no plans' to allow such opening, " he stressed.</P>
      <P>Any foreign country hoping to export long grain rice to Taiwan will be required
to submit official documents to verify its genetic footprint, Chen said.</P>
      <P>In response to the news report, the COA's Agriculture and Food Agency (AFA)
issued a statement later that same day to clarify that the government will not
open the market to foreign imports of genetically modified rice, nor has it
approved any such products to enter Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although  the DOH is making preparations  to include some genetically engineered
food in its food safety assessment operations, the statement said this does not
mean that Taiwan has allowed them to hit the local market.</P>
      <P>It also pointed out that Taiwan's development of genetically altered crops will
prioritize grain that will not be used for food.</P>
      <P>AFA Director-General Chen Wen-teh said the government does not favor imports of
foreign genetically altered rice, although it has to abide by the regulations of
the World Trade Organization (WTO), which allocates a quota every year for
Taiwanese imports of foreign rice.</P>
      <P>At present,  Taiwan only allows imports of non-genetically modified rice from
Vietnam, Japan and the United States, Chen noted.</P>

      <P>A 19-year-old girl in Taipei County has died of influenza A(H1N1), the 27th
fatality from the new flu strain recorded in Taiwan, the Central Epidemics
Command Center (CECC) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The victim, who had suffered from lupus and cardiomyopathy, could have been
infected with the virus in a hospital, according to officials of Taipei County's
Public Health Bureau.</P>
      <P>The girl was first hospitalized Sept. 22 suffering from low blood pressure, the
officials said. During the hospital stay, however, she was diagnosed with kidney
stones and developed a urinary tract infection, which led to bacterial
septicemia and a fungal infection.</P>
      <P>She was later also diagnosed with influenza A and died Oct. 24, they said.</P>
      <P>The results of tests released Oct. 27 show that she was infected with the H1N1
virus.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, CECC statistics show that there were 10 more patients hospitalized
with the flu strain than a day earlier.</P>
      <P>The total number of such cases since the outbreak began had reached 447, with 36
of the patients remaining in hospital, the CECC said.</P>
      <P>As of Tuesday, 809 classes in 427 schools around the country remained closed
because of H1N1 infections among the students. The number of affected classes
accounted for 0.54 percent of the total, according to the CECC.</P>
      <P>Chou Jih-haw, deputy director-general of the Centers for Disease Control, said
there has recently been an obvious increase in the number of students infected
with the flu strain, especially in junior high and elementary schools.</P>
      <P>Over the past several weeks, the number has been rising at a rate of 10 percent
to 20 percent per week, Chou said.</P>
      <P>Chou reminded the public that schools and parents who fail to comply with
measures adopted by the government to contain the H1N1 outbreak can be fined up
to NT$15,000 under the Communicable Disease Control Act.</P>
      <P>These measures include closing a class for five days whenever two students in
the class are diagnosed with flu-like symptoms in three days.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President denies trade deal behind expansion of U.S. beef imports</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that the government's decision to lift a
ban on imports of U.S. bone-in beef products is not linked to any broader trade
deal, and gave the assurance that his administration would not sacrifice
people's health for economic benefits.</P>
      <P>In an interview with a local weekly, The Journalist, Ma said that the lifting of
the ban on U.S. beef represented the removal of a major barrier between Taiwan
and the United States.</P>
      <P>He denied allegations that the government decided to lift the restrictions in
exchange for the resumption of U.S.-Taiwan Trade and Investment Framework
Agreement (TIFA) talks.</P>
      <P>Asked about the rationale behind the decision, Ma said that as a member of the
World Trade Organization  (WTO)  and the World Organization for Animal Health
(OIE) , Taiwan cannot disregard other members' requests for reciprocity.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the restrictions were lifted after taking into account the
health and safety of the Taiwan people. Taiwan still maintains stricter
standards for U.S beef imports than South Korea, he noted.</P>
      <P>Ma said the easing of the restrictions on U.S. beef imports is expected to help
boost relations between Taiwan and the United States.</P>
      <P>"Our greatly improved relations with China have raised concerns that our policy
is particularly favorable to China, but this time, we have removed a major
barrier between Taiwan and the U.S," he said.</P>
      <P>"The relaxation of the import restrictions on U.S. beef products does not mean
that the government is obliged to promote the products," the president added.</P>
      <P>He also said that if Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin opts to adopt stricter measures
in the city regarding U.S. beef imports, that would be his choice.</P>
      <P>"However, I guarantee there would be no problem if he eats U.S. beef products,"
Ma said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he noted, a health insurance measure will be introduced to help allay
pubic fears.</P>
      <P>"We have never said there is zero risk involved in easing the ban, but the level
of risk is acceptable from a professional standpoint," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Touching on the possible impact of the decision on the local beef industry, the
president said that in light of the fact that domestic beef accounts for 7
percent of the market share in Taiwan, the expansion of U.S. imports would not
impact significantly on local beef producers. However, it could affect imports
of New Zealand and Australian beef, he added.</P>
      <P>Ma said the U.S. had hoped that Taiwan would open its market fully to U.S. beef
imports, but after all-out efforts by the negotiators, it was decided that only
bone-in beef, ground beef and offal from cattle younger than 30 months would be
allowed to enter Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At an election campaign rally Wednesday for Kuomintang candidates in the year-
end local elections, Ma, in his capacity as KMT chairman, gave the assurance
that all U.S. beef imports are safe because they must meet domestic and
international health safety standards.</P>
      <P>He said the expansion of U.S beef imports is also proof that Taiwan is
conforming to the rules and norms of the international community and the process
of bilateral negotiations between WTO members.</P>

      <P>Following the lead of Amway China Co., another large Chinese direct-marketing
company has selected Taiwan as the incentive tour destination for its elite
staff members, tourism officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Pro-Health Group, one of China's three largest direct-marketing firms, will send
nearly 10,000 of its outstanding employees on incentive tours to Taiwan for
sightseeing and learning, starting Friday, the officials said.</P>
      <P>"The Pro-Health Group employees will visit Taiwan in seven batches on six-day
tours that will focus on major tourist attractions in central and northern
Taiwan, " said Yuan Kai-chih, a section chief at Taiwan's Tourism Bureau.</P>
      <P>The Pro-Health tour groups are expected to bring an estimated NT$600 million
(US$18.63 million) in tourism revenues to Taiwan, he added.</P>
      <P>According to Yuan, the company had originally selected Japan as this year's
incentive tour destination, but changed its plan and switched to Taiwan after a
strong lobby from Taiwan's tourism authorities and tour operators.</P>
      <P>Pro-Health Group Chairman Li Dao said at a news conference in Taipei Wednesday
that one of the major factors in the company's choice of Taiwan was its
employees' rising interest in and curiosity about Taiwan since cultural and
commercial exchanges across the Taiwan Strait began to grow a couple years ago.</P>
      <P>Praising Taiwan as having achieved many "world's firsts" in various fields, Li
said he believes that the Pro-Health employees will be able to learn something
from the Taiwan people's attitude to work and life and their perseverance.</P>
      <P>Li said that although the staff members will be unable to tour the famous
Alishan mountain resort because of damage wrought by Typhoon Morakot in August,
they can visit Taipei 101 tower, which he described as one of the world's
tallest buildings that symbolizes Taiwan's imagination and spirit of endurance.</P>
      <P>In addition to visiting popular tourist spots, Li said, the Pro-Health tour
groups will also visit a factory run by the Children Are Us Foundation and which
employs people suffering from Down's Syndrome,  cerebral  palsy,  multiple
dysfunction  and  other disabilities.</P>
      <P>"We believe the inclusion of the factory in our itinerary will make our Taiwan
trip even more meaningful," Li added.</P>
      <P>He further said his company is studying the feasibility of launching a venture
in Taiwan and that Taiwan's technology and management talent pool are attractive
factors.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Tourism Bureau Director-General Janice Lai said
Chinese authorities have approved the Pro-Health Group's large-scale Taiwan tour
plan on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>For their part, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council and National Immigration
Agency are giving their best efforts to accommodating the visits by the Pro-
Health tour groups, which they see as "seeds" to help promote Taiwan's tourist
attractions in the future, Lai said.</P>
      <P>To the best of her knowledge, Lai said, many large Chinese enterprises are
watching how the Pro-Health Group's Taiwan tours turn out.</P>
      <P>"If the tours turn out to be successful and delightful, we believe more Chinese
companies will follow suit," Lai said.</P>
      <P>Amway China Co. picked Taiwan as its incentive tour destination in March this
year and its employees made the trip aboard cruise liners.</P>
      <P>"Those tour packages were easier to arrange, but the Pro-Health Group's travel
packages are more complex, " Lai said, adding that the Tourism Bureau has
devoted much manpower  to assist with the arrangements.</P>
      <P>From Oct. 30 through Nov. 24, some 10,0000 Pro-Health Group employees will visit
Taiwan in seven batches of three groups each time on six-day-five-night tours
that will take them to renowned sightseeing spots such as Citou, Lugang, Sun
Moon Lake and Yehliu.</P>

      <P>Acer Inc, the world's No. 2 personal computer maker, expects its shipments of
portable PCs -- which include notebooks and netbooks -- to reach 40 million
units next year, making it the world's biggest portable PC maker, Acer Chairman
J.T. Wang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to Acer Chief Executive Gianfranco Lanci, the Taiwanese company is
expected to ship more than 30 million portable PCs this year.</P>
      <P>Wang also forecast that the company's revenue will grow 15 percent in 2010, with
shipments of personal computers rising 13 percent-15 percent next year.</P>
      <P>Following an Acer report of record numbers for both consolidated revenue and net
operating profit in the third quarter of this year, Wang said he also expects
the company's shipments to grow another 10 percent in Q4.</P>
      <P>Acer announced that consolidated revenues for Q3 should reach NT$167 billion
(US$5.19 billion) , up 40 percent from Q2 and up 5 percent from same time last
year, with a net operating profit of NT$4.7 billion.</P>
      <P>The company, which is due to hold its Q3 investor conference Friday, overtook
Dell as the world's No. 2 PC maker by shipment behind only Hewlett Packard (HP)
as of Q3, according to analysts.</P>
      <P>Wang also told reporters he expects the global portable PC market to grow by 50
percent next year, with Acer's shipments set to outperform the overall market.</P>
      <P>Although Acer is unlikely to beat HP's shipments of large notebooks, Wang said
Acer can exceed HP on shipments of netbooks and medium-size ultra-low voltage
notebooks.</P>
      <P>He added that emerging markets will be the company's major growth force next
year. Acer has performed well in India and Brazil and has kept ahead in Russia,
but still has much room for development in China, he said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lanci added that the company aims to be the No. 3 PC brand in China

      <P>The government has no timetable for conducting talks on cross-Taiwan Strait
confidence-building measures, a spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense
(MND)  said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Yu Sy-tue made the remarks after Qian Lihua, director of the Foreign Affairs
Office of China's Defense Ministry, said earlier in the day that China is happy
to see an easing of cross-strait tension and that it is willing to discuss
cross-strait confidence-building measures.</P>
      <P>But Qian said that it seems that Taiwan has yet to forge a substantive view on
the matter and he urged an early coordination of Taiwanese views on the issue.</P>
      <P>Responding to Qian's words, Yu noted that the government's current cross-strait
policy is based on three principles: the economy before politics; easy parts
before difficult parts; and urgent issues ahead of non-urgent issues.</P>
      <P>"The subjective and objective conditions have not yet ripened to the point that
talks can be conducted  on confidence-building measures, " he said, adding that
"the government has no timetable for embarking on such talks at present."</P>

      <P>Taiwanese nationals are expected to be granted visa-free privileges by the
European Union (EU) at some point between April and June 2010, an official of
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chiu Jong-jen, MOFA's director-general for European affairs, made the remarks
after Charles Tannock,  a member of the European Parliament (MEP) who chairs a
pro-Taiwan group in the parliament, said earlier in the day that Taiwanese
people will be able to enter EU nations without a visa in early 2010 at the
earliest.</P>
      <P>Tannock, who is making his first trip to Taiwan with eight other MEPs on a six-
day visit that started Oct. 25, made the remarks in a speech on the Taiwan-EU
partnership at the National Taiwan University International Convention Center in
Taipei City.</P>
      <P>In the speech, the British MEP revealed that he is working to persuade the EU to
grant visa-free privileges to Taiwanese visitors.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is an important trade partner of many European countries, Tannock said,
noting that although the EU maintains diplomatic ties with China, its friendship
toward Taiwan remains strong.</P>
      <P>He praised President Ma Ying-jeou for adopting his pragmatic "modus vivendi"
diplomatic policy that has gradually resulted in the reconciliation of the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait, even though Beijing, which sees Taiwan as part of
China, has always tried to suppress Taiwan in its bids to join influential
international organizations.</P>
      <P>Tannock also reiterated his support for Taiwan's meaningful participation in
United Nations-affiliated agencies.</P>
      <P>In 2008, Tannock used the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the World Health
Organization and the April 8 World Health Day to call for Taiwan to be admitted
as a full member of the global health body.</P>

      <P>A memorandum of understanding (MOU) on financial cooperation between Taiwan and
China will not be signed any later than New Year's Day, 2010, Financial
Supervisory Commission (FSC) Chairman Sean Chen said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while answering questions from lawmakers during a
legislative committee meeting, although he declined to confirm the venue for the
signing of the pact.</P>
      <P>"Judging from precedent, the signing of a cross-Taiwan Strait MOU will not be
carried out later than the beginning of next year, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the FSC submitted the issues relevant to the deal's signing
in mid-March to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, which has included them in its
"early harvest" list to be exchanged with China next week, paving the way for
the next round of informal two-way negotiations on a planned economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) set for Nov. 3-4 in Beijing.</P>
      <P>The list refers to industries or services that each side will open for immediate
tariff concessions or more liberal trade terms under the ECFA, similar to
provisions under a free trade agreement.</P>
      <P>Chen, however, said he did not agree to a proposal that the MOU be signed during
the fourth round of cross-Taiwan Strait talks between the Taipei-based  Straits
Exchange Foundation  and the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits -- slated to be held in Taichung in mid-December.</P>
      <P>Such an MOU should be inked by the financial supervisory authorities of the two
sides, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile that day, a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office under Beijing's
State Council, said that "in response to Taiwan's concern over the issue, we
hope to clinch the deal as soon as possible."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Exchange invitations from China reach fever pitch: Taipei official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China's invitations for cultural exchanges with Taipei have reached fever pitch,
the city's deputy mayor said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"China's demand for cultural exchanges with us far outpaces what we can provide,
" said Lee Yong-ping, who concurrently heads the city's Department of Cultural
Affairs. "If I were to accept every invitation from various Chinese cities, I
would have to spend a whole year in China," she added.</P>
      <P>Lee attributed the phenomenon mainly to the fact that Taiwan still has
advantages over China in the cultural field.</P>
      <P>"When people  my age in Taiwan were reading  freely  and extensively, pursuing
self-cultivation, China was engulfed in the disaster of the Cultural Revolution,
" she said in an interview with the Central News Agency, pointing out that
during the 1960s and 1970s, China was closed to the world.</P>
      <P>Even though China's present leadership is working hard to mend the scars of that
dark period in history, China still lags behind Taiwan to some extent as far as
cultural development is concerned, Lee said.</P>
      <P>"As a consequence, China is very interested in embarking on cultural exchanges
with Taiwan, and many Chinese groups have visited Taipei for that purpose," Lee
went on.</P>
      <P>In the face of the floods of invitations from China, Lee continued, the Taipei
city government's limited resources for such activities means it has to be
selective about which ones it accepts.</P>
      <P>"Taipei has limited space and its population is only one-tenth that of Shanghai,
so we must therefore be choosy in terms of the manpower and resources we can
commit," Lee said.</P>
      <P>During President Ma Ying-jeou's tenure as mayor of Taipei, Lee said, the city
laid a solid foundation for cultural exchanges with Beijing, while at present,
she noted, the city government under the leadership of Mayor Hau Lung-bin is
focusing on exchanges with Shanghai.</P>
      <P>After the Shanghai World Expo concludes at the end of October next year, Lee
said, the city government will then turn its attention to major southern Chinese
cities such as Guangzhou and Shenzhen.</P>

Altair that the two parties signed two days earlier in which advanced 4G
cellular communication chips developed by Altair will be installed in Mitac's

      <P>A Tainan city councilor said Wednesday that he will appeal a court' s decision
to sentence him to four months in prison after convicting him of harassing a
visiting Chinese official in an incident that erupted in the city last year and
was widely watched on television in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I have decided to appeal against the sentence handed down to me by the Tainan
District Court, because I did not tussle Zhang Mingqing to the ground," Wang
Ding-yu told reporters.</P>
      <P>The Tainan District Court announced its verdict against Wang on Sept. 21 this
year.</P>
      <P>When the incident occurred on Oct. 21, 2008, Zhang, vice president of the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , was
visiting Taiwan to attend an academic seminar in southern Taiwan's Tainan City
in his private capacity as a scholar.</P>
      <P>Wang was accused of pushing Zhang to the ground in a protest against Zhang when
he was on a private tour of the city's Confucius Temple that day. Zhang led a
group of pro-Taiwan independence protesters who accosted Zhang.</P>
      <P>Zhang, who suffered minor bruises and injuries, was rushed to a Tainan hospital.
He filed a compliant with the local police authorities and immediately returned
to China next day, cutting short his visit in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang has insisted he did not push Zhang and that Zhang simply lost his balance.</P>
      <P>Six other accomplices were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 40 days to
four months after being indicted on charges of hindering personal freedom, but
all of the six have the option of paying a fine instead of serving their prison
terms.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, he has been soliciting cash donations for his six companions
and he will use the money to help them pay the fines so they will not have to
serve their prison sentences.</P>
      <P>The incident happened as Taiwan,  under the government of President Ma Ying-
jeou, was actively trying to improve relations with China.</P>
      <P>Zhang's visit preceded that of Chen Yunlin, the highest ranking Chinese envoy to
visit Taiwan in years and the head of ARATS.</P>
      <P>Partly as a result of the incident involving Zhang, Taiwanese authorities
stepped up security measures during Chen's visit.</P>

      <P>Banciao prosecutors on Wednesday listed eight local baseball players as
defendants in a case of game fixing and took one of them into custody and
released two others on bail.</P>
      <P>Chang Chih-chia, formerly of Japan's Seibu Lions and now a La New Bears player,
and former Colorado Rockies and Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Tsao Chin-hui, were
released after being questioned by prosecutors from the Banciao District
Prosecutors Office in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Wang Chin-li of Brother Elephants was taken into custody on charges of fraud in
the investigation into the latest game-fixing scandal to hit Taiwan's
professional baseball league.</P>
      <P>The players have been accused of throwing games of their own free will and so
far, no evidence of violence or threats has surfaced, the prosecutors said. In
previous similar cases it was found that organized crime figures had threatened
players to force them to throw games.</P>
      <P>The players in the current case allegedly colluded with bookmaker Tsai Cheng-yi,
the alleged head of a gambling syndicate, and accepted cash payments to either
throw games or manipulate the score in at least nine regular season games
between May and September, according to evidence obtained by the prosecutors.</P>
      <P>Before he was questioned by prosecutors,  Tsao, the first Taiwanese player to
compete in U.S. Major League Baseball, vehemently denied to the press that he
had taken bribes or thrown games.</P>
      <P>The other defendants are Lee Hao-jen, Liu Yu-chan, Wang Chun-tai and Wu Pau-
hsien, who are all members of Brother Elephants, and Hsieh Chia-hsien of Sinon
Bulls.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chung-yu of La New Bears was also questioned as a witness. Local newspaper
reports, citing investigative sources, claimed that starting pitchers were paid
NT$3 million and relievers NT$500,000 to cooperate in the scheme, which

      <P>China's spokeswoman for the Taiwan Affairs Office said Wednesday that the
authorities have cracked down on a number of Chinese companies that have
illegally used Taiwanese-registered trademarks, such as "Alishan" or "Gukeng
coffee."</P>
      <P>Fan Liqing said that the authorities have revoked the trademark registrations of
companies that illegally used the names of a number of Taiwan's agricultural
products and geographic landmarks.</P>
      <P>Those names are registered trademarks of Taiwanese businesses, national parks or
local governments. They include names such as "Alishan" -the famous mountain in
central Taiwan; the scenic spot Sun Moon Lake; the Spring at Wushe, an area in
central Taiwan's Nantou county, which is well known for its gorgeous mountain
scenery, as well as Chihshang and Hsilo, areas in Taiwan which are famous for
growing high quality rice.</P>
      <P>A trademark registration of the name of "Gukeng coffee" - a brand of Taiwanese
coffee grown in an area called Gukeng - was also revoked, according to Fan, who
was speaking at a regularly scheduled news conference.</P>
      <P>Fan, however, did not immediately provide information on when the crackdown
occurred or how the thefts of Taiwanese trademarks were punished.</P>
      <P>She said that since 2006, China has intensified its crackdown and punishment of
trademark counterfeiting and amended laws to strengthen protection of Taiwan's
registered trademarks of geographic landmarks and agricultural products in order
to safeguard the rights and interests of Taiwanese businesses.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwanese companies, like other foreign companies doing business in
China, have complained that not enough is being done and punishment should be
stiffer.</P>
      <P>Trademark infringement is a widespread problem in China and a headache for
companies doing business in the mainland.</P>
      <P>More Taiwanese companies, however, are registering their trademarks in China.</P>
      <P>Fan indicated that between 2002 and the end of September this year, Taiwanese
companies or individuals had filed 72,658 trademark registrations in China, of
which, 46,850 were granted.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese companies and individuals owned a total of around 63,000 valid
registered trademarks in China by the end of September, Fan said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  eight Taiwan-owned trademarks had been accorded well-known trademark
status in China. The trademarks are Giant, the best selling brand of bicycles in
Taiwan;  Uni-President food products; Girdear clothing, BENQ electronics
products, Mingtien coffee house chain, Nature Beauty body care products, Acer
laptops, and Want Want snacks, Fan said.</P>

      <P>Riding on its success in promoting Taiwan's creative industry in China at an
annual cultural fair in Beijing in the past few years, Taipei will join forces
with Shanghai to organize a similar event next year, an official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Taipei Deputy Mayor Lee Yong-ping said in an interview with the Central News
Agency that the city has had a theme hall at the annual Beijing International
Cultural and Creative Industry Exposition every year since 2007, which has
turned out to be a very useful sales channel for local companies in the sector.</P>
      <P>"At the height of the global financial crisis last autumn, Taiwanese exhibitors
managed to obtain nearly NT$100 million (US$3.12 million) in orders at the 2008
Beijing cultural fair, " said Lee who also heads Taipei's Department of Cultural
Affairs.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by the continued spike in sales, local operators in the cultural and
creative industry have been very keenly registering for this year's fair
scheduled for December, Lee added.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, she said, the city government is planning to collaborate
with Shanghai to organize a cultural and creative industry exposition in the
largest Chinese city next year to give people there a better understanding of
Taipei's many attributes.</P>
      <P>Lee said a series of cultural forums on a variety of themes will be held
simultaneously to promote Taiwan's capital city.</P>
      <P>Lee, who will travel to Shanghai Thursday for a dedication ceremony for the two
Taipei halls at World Expo 2010, further said the city government is planning to
organize a Taipei Culture Week in Shanghai next year as part of its efforts to
attract Chinese tourists to an international flower show in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The Taipei International Garden and Horticulture Exposition will take place
between Nov.6, 2010 and April 25, 2011, Lee said, adding that she will take
advantage of her upcoming trip to Shanghai to convince city authorities to help
promote the event among Chinese citizens in the coming year.</P>
      <P>The planned Taipei Culture Week in Shanghai will feature many activities,
including a painting exhibition, theatrical and musical performances and a film
festival that will include outdoor screenings of Taiwanese movies, Lee added.</P>
      <P>In addition to attending the dedication of the 375-square- meter area for the
two Taipei halls at the Shanghai World Expo, Lee will also preside over a
ceremony to mark the start of the interior decoration of the two Taipei halls.</P>
      <P>The displays in the two Taipei halls will highlight Taipei's achievements in
building a ubiquitous broadband wireless network and in resources recycling, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>Saying that few cities in the world can match Taipei in terms of resources
recycling, Lee promised that the city government will use the 2010 Shanghai
World Expo to tout its success in waste reduction achieved by means
comprehensive garbage classification and resources recycling.</P>
      <P>"We have been so successful in waste reduction that our existing incinerators
have not even reached their capacity and we will realize the goal of 'zero
landfill' by the end of this year, " Lee said proudly.</P>
      <P>In addition to its well-known tourist attractions such as night markets, Taipei
101 tower and the National Palace Museum, Lee said, Taipei has many other
advantages that include a low crime rate, convenient public transportation
system, many convenience stores and 24-hour Eslite bookstores.</P>
      <P>"The city government will highlight our advantages at the Shanghai World Expo to

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan did not give in to the U.S. on beef imports: official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 28 (CNA)
10/28/09  22:50:44</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Secretary General of the National Security Council (NSC) said Wednesday
that the government's decision to allow previously banned U.S. beef products to
be imported to the island resulted from negotiations with Washington that have
proven that Taiwan is capable of negotiating, which is significant as Taiwan
will soon engage in a series of negotiations.</P>
      <P>Su Chi made the remarks at a news conference convened to clear public doubts
regarding the government's decision-making process and negotiation capability in
the aftermath of its decision on U.S. beef.</P>
      <P>The government's decision this month to allow U.S. bone-in beef, ground beef and
offal to be imported to Taiwan after they had been banned due to fears of mad
cow disease has generated criticism from the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), as well as members of the ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Refuting the claim that the government has totally given in by relaxing
restrictions on the beef imports, Su asserted that by reaching the agreement
with the U.S., Taiwan has established its credibility in negotiations.</P>
      <P>He stressed the significance of the negotiations over beef imports, saying
"Taiwan will soon enter into an era of negotiations."</P>
      <P>Many issues need to be resolved through negotiations with the U.S., Japan, the
European Union, Southeast Asian countries, and mainland China, Su elaborated.</P>
      <P>As South Korea was able to achieve the signing of a free trade agreement with
the United States and the U.S. began allowing Korean visitors to enter the U.S.
without visas after Seoul eased restrictions on U.S. beef imports, many people
in Taiwan are expecting that the Korean model can be applied to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But Su was reluctant to make such an assumption.</P>
      <P>He said that the past eight years of governing by the DPP had pushed Taiwan to
the brink of war with China, but that thanks to efforts by current President Ma
Ying-jeou's administration, Taiwan has been able to recover mutual trust with
the U.S., Japan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Su explained that the decision of relaxing restrictions on U.S. beef imports was
reached after a long process of 17 months of review and three stages of
discussions.</P>
      <P>The government will review the implementation of the relaxation of the ban on
U.S. beef products after the new practice is put into force for 180 days, Su
said. (By Carfie Li and Lillian Lin)/cs</P>

      <P>In late 2010, Taiwan will begin efforts to convert the status of its main
international airport and four harbor bureaus from administrative agencies to
corporations in the hope of improving their global competitiveness, an official
at the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Yin Cheng-peng, director of the MOTC's Department of Aviation and Navigation,
said this would allow for more flexibility in expanding business at Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport and the harbors in Kaohsiung, Taichung, Keelung
and Hualien.</P>
      <P>They will be able to open branch companies based on their operational needs and
make overseas investments, he added.</P>
      <P>The airport company will be set up by the end of 2010, while the four harbor
corporations will come into effect the following year, Yin said.</P>
      <P>The decision was prompted by a drop in the international rankings of the airport
and harbors in terms of their operational volumes over the past years, which Yin
said signaled that Taiwan was losing its edge as a transportation hub in the
Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>According to Containerisation International statistics, Kaohsiung Harbor,
Taiwan's largest, ranked 12th globally in 2008 in terms of container loading and
unloading volumes, dropping from eighth place in 2007. It was the harbor's
lowest ranking ever, and its first fall from the top-10 list.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taoyuan airport dropped from 14th place in 2007 in terms of
passenger volume to 18th in 2008 among the 136 international airports in the
Asia-Pacific region, the MOTC said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Go prodigy defeated her Japanese opponent Wednesday to successfully
defend her women's Honinbo title for the second consecutive year.</P>
      <P>This is the third year in a row that Hsieh Yi Min has captured the coveted
title. The 19-year-old Go ace now holds two of the three principal titles on
Japan's professional women's Go scene.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also succeeded in defending her women's Meijin title in June this year.</P>
      <P>In the Honinbo competition, Hsieh lost the first match but won the ensuing three
games to retain her title.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said she originally did not expect to emerge as the victor because her
opponent, Kikuyo Aoki, was a veteran player.</P>
      <P>Aoki, 41, is very brilliant and experienced, Hsieh said, adding that she learned
much from her opponent throughout the four rounds of the contest.</P>
      <P>"As a matter of fact, I encountered many tough challenges in the whole process
and I believe that these demanding encounters will help me to perfect my skills,
" Hsieh said, adding that she will continue her pursuit of excellence in order
to secure a good rating in international competitions in the future.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, from northern Taiwan's Miaoli County, began to play Go at the age of 5.
She went to Japan in 2002 and became a professional player in 2004, formally
registering with the Japan Go Association at the age of 14. She was the youngest
player ever to enter Japan's professional Go circuit.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China's spokeswoman for the Taiwan Affairs Office said Wednesday that the
authorities have cracked down on a number of Chinese companies that have
illegally used Taiwanese-registered trademarks, such as "Alishan" or "Gukeng
coffee."</P>
      <P>Fan Liqing said that the authorities have revoked the trademark registrations of
companies that illegally used the names of a number of Taiwan's agricultural
products and geographic landmarks.</P>
      <P>Those names are registered trademarks of Taiwanese businesses, national parks or
local governments. They include names such as "Alishan" -the famous mountain in
central Taiwan; the scenic spot Sun Moon Lake; the Spring at Wushe, an area in
central Taiwan's Nantou county, which is well known for its gorgeous mountain
scenery, as well as Chihshang and Hsilo, areas in Taiwan which are famous for
growing high quality rice.</P>
      <P>A trademark registration of the name of "Gukeng coffee" - a brand of Taiwanese
coffee grown in an area called Gukeng - was also revoked, according to Fan, who
was speaking at a regularly scheduled news conference.</P>
      <P>Fan, however, did not immediately provide information on when the crackdown
occurred or how the thefts of Taiwanese trademarks were punished.</P>
      <P>She said that since 2006, China has intensified its crackdown and punishment of
trademark counterfeiting and amended laws to strengthen protection of Taiwan's
registered trademarks of geographic landmarks and agricultural products in order
to safeguard the rights and interests of Taiwanese businesses.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwanese companies, like other foreign companies doing business in
China, have complained that not enough is being done and punishment should be
stiffer.</P>
      <P>Trademark infringement is a widespread problem in China and a headache for
companies doing business in the mainland.</P>
      <P>More Taiwanese companies, however, are registering their trademarks in China.</P>
      <P>Fan indicated that between 2002 and the end of September this year, Taiwanese
companies or individuals had filed 72,658 trademark registrations in China, of
which, 46,850 were granted.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese companies and individuals owned a total of around 63,000 valid
registered trademarks in China by the end of September, Fan said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  eight Taiwan-owned trademarks had been accorded well-known trademark
status in China. The trademarks are Giant, the best selling brand of bicycles in
Taiwan;  Uni-President food products; Girdear clothing, BENQ electronics
products, Mingtien coffee house chain, Nature Beauty body care products, Acer
laptops, and Want Want snacks, Fan said.</P>

      <P>Riding on its success in promoting Taiwan's creative industry in China at an
annual cultural fair in Beijing in the past few years, Taipei will join forces
with Shanghai to organize a similar event next year, an official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Taipei Deputy Mayor Lee Yong-ping said in an interview with the Central News
Agency that the city has had a theme hall at the annual Beijing International
Cultural and Creative Industry Exposition every year since 2007, which has
turned out to be a very useful sales channel for local companies in the sector.</P>
      <P>"At the height of the global financial crisis last autumn, Taiwanese exhibitors
managed to obtain nearly NT$100 million (US$3.12 million) in orders at the 2008
Beijing cultural fair, " said Lee who also heads Taipei's Department of Cultural
Affairs.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by the continued spike in sales, local operators in the cultural and
creative industry have been very keenly registering for this year's fair
scheduled for December, Lee added.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, she said, the city government is planning to collaborate
with Shanghai to organize a cultural and creative industry exposition in the
largest Chinese city next year to give people there a better understanding of
Taipei's many attributes.</P>
      <P>Lee said a series of cultural forums on a variety of themes will be held
simultaneously to promote Taiwan's capital city.</P>
      <P>Lee, who will travel to Shanghai Thursday for a dedication ceremony for the two
Taipei halls at World Expo 2010, further said the city government is planning to
organize a Taipei Culture Week in Shanghai next year as part of its efforts to
attract Chinese tourists to an international flower show in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The Taipei International Garden and Horticulture Exposition will take place
between Nov.6, 2010 and April 25, 2011, Lee said, adding that she will take
advantage of her upcoming trip to Shanghai to convince city authorities to help
promote the event among Chinese citizens in the coming year.</P>
      <P>The planned Taipei Culture Week in Shanghai will feature many activities,
including a painting exhibition, theatrical and musical performances and a film
festival that will include outdoor screenings of Taiwanese movies, Lee added.</P>
      <P>In addition to attending the dedication of the 375-square- meter area for the
two Taipei halls at the Shanghai World Expo, Lee will also preside over a
ceremony to mark the start of the interior decoration of the two Taipei halls.</P>
      <P>The displays in the two Taipei halls will highlight Taipei's achievements in
building a ubiquitous broadband wireless network and in resources recycling, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>Saying that few cities in the world can match Taipei in terms of resources
recycling, Lee promised that the city government will use the 2010 Shanghai
World Expo to tout its success in waste reduction achieved by means
comprehensive garbage classification and resources recycling.</P>
      <P>"We have been so successful in waste reduction that our existing incinerators
have not even reached their capacity and we will realize the goal of 'zero
landfill' by the end of this year, " Lee said proudly.</P>
      <P>In addition to its well-known tourist attractions such as night markets, Taipei
101 tower and the National Palace Museum, Lee said, Taipei has many other
advantages that include a low crime rate, convenient public transportation
system, many convenience stores and 24-hour Eslite bookstores.</P>
      <P>"The city government will highlight our advantages at the Shanghai World Expo to
let Chinese citizens know Taipei has one of the best living and travel
environments for backpackers, young students and intellectuals," she added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan did not give in to the U.S. on beef imports: official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 28 (CNA)
10/28/09  22:50:44</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Secretary General of the National Security Council (NSC) said Wednesday
that the government's decision to allow previously banned U.S. beef products to
be imported to the island resulted from negotiations with Washington that have
proven that Taiwan is capable of negotiating, which is significant as Taiwan
will soon engage in a series of negotiations.</P>
      <P>Su Chi made the remarks at a news conference convened to clear public doubts
regarding the government's decision-making process and negotiation capability in
the aftermath of its decision on U.S. beef.</P>
      <P>The government's decision this month to allow U.S. bone-in beef, ground beef and
offal to be imported to Taiwan after they had been banned due to fears of mad
cow disease has generated criticism from the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), as well as members of the ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Refuting the claim that the government has totally given in by relaxing
restrictions on the beef imports, Su asserted that by reaching the agreement
with the U.S., Taiwan has established its credibility in negotiations.</P>
      <P>He stressed the significance of the negotiations over beef imports, saying
"Taiwan will soon enter into an era of negotiations."</P>
      <P>Many issues need to be resolved through negotiations with the U.S., Japan, the
European Union, Southeast Asian countries, and mainland China, Su elaborated.</P>
      <P>As South Korea was able to achieve the signing of a free trade agreement with
the United States and the U.S. began allowing Korean visitors to enter the U.S.
without visas after Seoul eased restrictions on U.S. beef imports, many people
in Taiwan are expecting that the Korean model can be applied to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But Su was reluctant to make such an assumption.</P>
      <P>He said that the past eight years of governing by the DPP had pushed Taiwan to
the brink of war with China, but that thanks to efforts by current President Ma
Ying-jeou's administration, Taiwan has been able to recover mutual trust with
the U.S., Japan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Su explained that the decision of relaxing restrictions on U.S. beef imports was
reached after a long process of 17 months of review and three stages of
discussions.</P>
      <P>The government will review the implementation of the relaxation of the ban on
U.S. beef products after the new practice is put into force for 180 days, Su
said. (By Carfie Li and Lillian Lin)/cs</P>

    <HEADLINE>Main airport, harbors to be converted into corporations: official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In late 2010, Taiwan will begin efforts to convert the status of its main
international airport and four harbor bureaus from administrative agencies to
corporations in the hope of improving their global competitiveness, an official
at the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Yin Cheng-peng, director of the MOTC's Department of Aviation and Navigation,
said this would allow for more flexibility in expanding business at Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport and the harbors in Kaohsiung, Taichung, Keelung
and Hualien.</P>
      <P>They will be able to open branch companies based on their operational needs and
make overseas investments, he added.</P>
      <P>The airport company will be set up by the end of 2010, while the four harbor
corporations will come into effect the following year, Yin said.</P>
      <P>The decision was prompted by a drop in the international rankings of the airport
and harbors in terms of their operational volumes over the past years, which Yin
said signaled that Taiwan was losing its edge as a transportation hub in the
Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>According to Containerisation International statistics, Kaohsiung Harbor,
Taiwan's largest, ranked 12th globally in 2008 in terms of container loading and
unloading volumes, dropping from eighth place in 2007. It was the harbor's
lowest ranking ever, and its first fall from the top-10 list.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taoyuan airport dropped from 14th place in 2007 in terms of
passenger volume to 18th in 2008 among the 136 international airports in the
Asia-Pacific region, the MOTC said.</P>

scheduled for December, Lee added.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, she said, the city government is planning to collaborate
with Shanghai to organize a cultural and creative industry exposition in the
largest Chinese city next year to give people there a better understanding of
Taipei's many attributes.</P>
      <P>Lee said a series of cultural forums on a variety of themes will be held
simultaneously to promote Taiwan's capital city.</P>
      <P>Lee, who will travel to Shanghai Thursday for a dedication ceremony for the two
Taipei halls at World Expo 2010, further said the city government is planning to
organize a Taipei Culture Week in Shanghai next year as part of its efforts to
attract Chinese tourists to an international flower show in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The Taipei International Garden and Horticulture Exposition will take place
between Nov.6, 2010 and April 25, 2011, Lee said, adding that she will take
advantage of her upcoming trip to Shanghai to convince city authorities to help
promote the event among Chinese citizens in the coming year.</P>
      <P>The planned Taipei Culture Week in Shanghai will feature many activities,
including a painting exhibition, theatrical and musical performances and a film
festival that will include outdoor screenings of Taiwanese movies, Lee added.</P>
      <P>In addition to attending the dedication of the 375-square- meter area for the
two Taipei halls at the Shanghai World Expo, Lee will also preside over a
ceremony to mark the start of the interior decoration of the two Taipei halls.</P>
      <P>The displays in the two Taipei halls will highlight Taipei's achievements in
building a ubiquitous broadband wireless network and in resources recycling, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>Saying that few cities in the world can match Taipei in terms of resources
recycling, Lee promised that the city government will use the 2010 Shanghai
World Expo to tout its success in waste reduction achieved by means
comprehensive garbage classification and resources recycling.</P>
      <P>"We have been so successful in waste reduction that our existing incinerators
have not even reached their capacity and we will realize the goal of 'zero
landfill' by the end of this year, " Lee said proudly.</P>
      <P>In addition to its well-known tourist attractions such as night markets, Taipei
101 tower and the National Palace Museum, Lee said, Taipei has many other
advantages that include a low crime rate, convenient public transportation
system, many convenience stores and 24-hour Eslite bookstores.</P>
      <P>"The city government will highlight our advantages at the Shanghai World Expo to
let Chinese citizens know Taipei has one of the best living and travel
environments for backpackers, young students and intellectuals," she added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan did not give in to the U.S. on beef imports: official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 28 (CNA)
10/29/09  09:27:42</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Secretary General of the National Security Council (NSC) said Wednesday
that the government's decision to allow previously banned U.S. beef products to
be imported to the island resulted from negotiations with Washington that have
proven that Taiwan is capable of negotiating, which is significant as Taiwan
will soon engage in a series of negotiations.</P>
      <P>Su Chi made the remarks at a news conference convened to clear public doubts
regarding the government's decision-making process and negotiation capability in
the aftermath of its decision on U.S. beef.</P>
      <P>The government's decision this month to allow U.S. bone-in beef, ground beef and
offal to be imported to Taiwan after they had been banned due to fears of mad
cow disease has generated criticism from the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), as well as members of the ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Refuting the claim that the government has totally given in by relaxing
restrictions on the beef imports, Su asserted that by reaching the agreement
with the U.S., Taiwan has established its credibility in negotiations.</P>
      <P>He stressed the significance of the negotiations over beef imports, saying
"Taiwan will soon enter into an era of negotiations."</P>
      <P>Many issues need to be resolved through negotiations with the U.S., Japan, the
European Union, Southeast Asian countries, and mainland China, Su elaborated.</P>
      <P>As South Korea was able to achieve the signing of a free trade agreement with
the United States and the U.S. began allowing Korean visitors to enter the U.S.
without visas after Seoul eased restrictions on U.S. beef imports, many people
in Taiwan are expecting that the Korean model can be applied to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But Su was reluctant to make such an assumption.</P>
      <P>He said that the past eight years of governing by the DPP had pushed Taiwan to
the brink of war with China, but that thanks to efforts by current President Ma
Ying-jeou's administration, Taiwan has been able to recover mutual trust with
the U.S., Japan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Su explained that the decision of relaxing restrictions on U.S. beef imports was
reached after a long process of 17 months of review and three stages of
discussions.</P>
      <P>The government will review the implementation of the relaxation of the ban on
U.S. beef products after the new practice is put into force for 180 days, Su
said. (By Carfie Li and Lillian Lin)/cs</P>

    <HEADLINE>Main airport, harbors to be converted into corporations: official</HEADLINE>

(By Wang Chu-fen &amp; Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In late 2010, Taiwan will begin efforts to convert the status of its main
international airport and four harbor bureaus from administrative agencies to
corporations in the hope of improving their global competitiveness, an official
at the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Yin Cheng-peng, director of the MOTC's Department of Aviation and Navigation,
said this would allow for more flexibility in expanding business at Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport and the harbors in Kaohsiung, Taichung, Keelung
and Hualien.</P>
      <P>They will be able to open branch companies based on their operational needs and
make overseas investments, he added.</P>
      <P>The airport company will be set up by the end of 2010, while the four harbor
corporations will come into effect the following year, Yin said.</P>
      <P>The decision was prompted by a drop in the international rankings of the airport
and harbors in terms of their operational volumes over the past years, which Yin
said signaled that Taiwan was losing its edge as a transportation hub in the
Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>According to Containerisation International statistics, Kaohsiung Harbor,
Taiwan's largest, ranked 12th globally in 2008 in terms of container loading and
unloading volumes, dropping from eighth place in 2007. It was the harbor's
lowest ranking ever, and its first fall from the top-10 list.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taoyuan airport dropped from 14th place in 2007 in terms of
passenger volume to 18th in 2008 among the 136 international airports in the
Asia-Pacific region, the MOTC said.</P>

feet, they regard him as their belly and heart; when he regards them as dogs and
horses, they regard him as a common citizen; when he regards them as dirt and
grass, they regard him as a robber and enemy."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>Israeli orchestra pays tribute to late ROC diplomat</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 29 (CNA)
10/29/09  10:57:01
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A leading Israeli symphony orchestra in the city of Raanana on Wednesday night
dedicated a special piece of music to alate diplomat of the Republic of China
(ROC) in recognition of his courage in helping many Jews to escape the Nazis in
Austria during World War II.</P>
      <P>Raphael Gamzou, the head of the Israel Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei
(ISECO) , told the Central News Agency that Raanana Symphonette Orchestra on
Wednesday night premiered six special compositions, including one dedicated to
late ROC diplomat Ho Feng-shan. The event was held to pay tribute to several
awardees of the Righteous Among the Nations -- a title bestowed on non-Jews who
risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust.</P>
      <P>"This is an important act that will also remain for generations to come because
it will become part of the cultural treasures of Israel," said Gamzou.</P>
      <P>"Silent Skies: a tribute to Feng-shan Ho" was written by leading Israeli
composer Michael Wolpe to express his gratitude to the people who saved his
family and by whose efforts he could live peacefully in a free land, according
to Gamzou.</P>
      <P>It was part of a special project between the orchestra and Yad Vashem -- the
Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority -- in which six leading
Israeli composers were commissioned to write original pieces of music for the
Righteous Among the Nations, he added.</P>
      <P>The six compositions will performed at the Raanana orchestra's 2009-2010 season
concerts and after which the music and the presentations will be available on
the Web sites of Yad VaShem and the orchestra at http: //www.yadvashem.org and
http://www.symphonette.co.il.</P>
      <P>Representative Gamzou told CNA that he would be pleased if the orchestra was
invited to Taiwan to perform the new piece of music because it carries a
message.</P>
      <P>"Indeed I believe that this hero (Ho Feng-shan) should be put on a pedestal and
should be a role model for young Taiwanese and for generations to come, as this
is more than a chapter of the Israel's history but a great lesson for humanity,"
Gamzou said.</P>
      <P>Ho Feng-shan was posted to the Austrian capital of Vienna in 1937 and was
promoted to the post of consul-general there the following year, when Austria
was annexed by Nazi Germany.</P>
      <P>The Jews in Austria were desperate to flee the country, but had difficulty
getting visas, as 32 countries refused to accept Jewish immigrants because they
feared Germany.</P>
      <P>Out of sympathy for the plight of the Jews, Ho issued visas to many of them in
defiance of a ban from the ROC Ambassador to Berlin Chen Jie, providing them
with opportunities to escape to other countries via China.</P>
      <P>It is unclear how many visas he issued to the Jewish refugees at the time, but
the number is believed to be around 2,000.</P>
      <P>Ho retired from the diplomatic service in 1973 and died in San Francisco in
1997.</P>
      <P>His actions in Vienna went unnoticed until his bereaved children revealed them
in his obituary, which was published in the Boston Globe, prompting the Israeli
group Yad VaShem -- Israel's national Authority for the Remembrance of the
Martyrs and Heroes of the Holocaust -- to bestow upon him in 2001 the title of
Righteous Among the Nations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Obama will have to deal soon with arms sales to Taiwan: scholars</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct. 28 (CNA)
10/29/09  12:56:43
(By Zep Hu and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. President Barack Obama will soon have to face the issue of whether the U.S.
should continue arms sales to Taiwan, after he visits Beijing in mid November,
scholars in Washington said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Obama is scheduled to pay his first state visit to China on Nov. 15 after
attending the Nov. 12-14 leaders summit of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum in Singapore.</P>
      <P>At an academic colloquium in Washington, Alan Romberg, director of the East
Asian Studies division of the Henry L. Stimson Center, speculated that Beijing
will strongly protest if President Obama authorizes a new round of arms sales to
Taiwan, even if the package does not include the high performance F-16C/Ds jet
fighters that Taiwan is eager to acquire.</P>
      <P>The worst reaction from China in the past was its suspension of military
exchanges with the U.S. over Washington's decisions on arms sales to Taiwan,
Romberg said at the seminar hosted by George Washington University's Center for
Asian Studies.</P>
      <P>However, it's uncertain how strong Beijing's protest would be this time, he
added.</P>
      <P>At the colloquium, titled U.S. Policy Directions on Taiwan, another panelist,
National Defense University professor Bernard Cole, estimated that President
Obama would have to deal with the arms sales issue in 2010 at the latest.</P>
      <P>However, Cole said, the most worrying factors would be the Taiwan leadership's
apparent lack of interest in modernizing the island's military and the impact of
an aging society on the Taiwan armed forces.</P>
      <P>Another panelist, Georgetown University professor Nancy Tucker, said she noticed
that there are voices in Taiwan arguing against spending a fortune to acquire
weapons now that cross-Taiwan Strait relations  have  improved  under  President
Ma  Ying-jeou's administration.</P>
      <P>Others in Taiwan are worried that improved cross-strait ties may lead Washington
to become too complacent (about cross-strait ties) to sell weapon systems to
Taiwan, Tucker added.</P>
      <P>She said the Pentagon will probably not consider selling F-16C/Ds to Taiwan, but
in reality, the Taiwan Air Force does not have many choices in its efforts to
acquire more advanced fighters to maintain its defense capability. The F-16C/Ds
are one of the options, she said.</P>
      <P>The scholars agreed that the Obama administration should continue to provide
Taiwan with defensive weapons under the terms of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA).</P>
      <P>On one hand, this would demonstrate the United States' commitment to Taiwan, and
on the other would avoid criticism of President Ma by Taiwan's opposition
parties, they said.</P>
      <P>Under the Taiwan Relations Act, which was passed in 1979 after Washington
severed formal diplomatic ties with Taipei in favor of Beijing, the U.S.
guarantees defensive arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The U.S. Defense Department notified Congress on Oct. 3, 2008 of its approval of
a US$6.46 billion arms package to Taiwan, which includes Apache attack
helicopters, Patriot PAC-3 missile batteries, Javelin anti-tank missiles and
sea-launched Harpoon missiles, as well as an upgrade of the E-2T aircraft to the
Hawkeye 2000 configuration, along with related support equipment.</P>
      <P>The  approved  package,  however,  does  not  include  the diesel-electric
submarines, Black Hawk helicopters and F-16C/Ds that Taiwan was seeking.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Official denies Taiwan's traffic fatality rate highest in the world</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation  and Communication (MOTC) denied Thursday reports
in the local media that Taiwan's traffic accident fatality rate was the highest
in the world.</P>
      <P>The latest statistics from the International Road Federation (IRF) showed that
the number of deaths per 10,000 vehicles in Taiwan was 1.56, compared to 7.92 in
China, 3.77 in Canada, 2.65 in South Korea, 2.52 in France, 2.44 in Singapore,
2.38 in Hong Kong, and 1.71 in the United States, the MOTC said.</P>
      <P>The rate was relatively lower in some European countries -- 1.57 in Italy, 1.0
in the U.K., and 0.97 in Germany, said Hsieh Shu-yi, executive secretary of the
MOTC's Road Traffic Safety Commission (RTSC).</P>
      <P>Local media reports on Thursday quoted a traffic official as saying at a seminar
Wednesday that Taiwan's fatality rate from traffic accidents was higher than the
U.S, Japan, South Korea, Germany and France's.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that the official had quoted the data incorrectly, explaining that
the IRF only collects vehicle data.</P>
      <P>He said it would be misleading to compare Taiwan's motorcycle accident rate with
that of the U.S. or European countries, as there are far fewer motorcycles in
those countries than in Asia.</P>
      <P>The motorcycle fatality rates in Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam are
definitely higher than in Taiwan, but those southeast Asian countries do not yet
have a database of such statistics, he added.</P>

      <P>Taipei Deputy Mayor Lee Yong-ping departed Taipei Thursday for Shanghai to
promote the Taipei International Garden and Horticulture Exposition that will be
held in Taipei City between Nov.6, 2010 and April 25, 2011.</P>
      <P>Lee took with her the official mascot of the Taipei flora expo, which will be
one of the biggest international events to be organized by the city.</P>
      <P>The mascot -- called Yabi the Seed Baby -- proved to be an instant eye catcher
and crowd puller at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport. EVA Airways provided a
ticket for the mascot to have a seat in the passenger cabin on the flight to
Shanghai.</P>
      <P>In addition to promoting the Taipei flora expo, Lee and her group will attend a
groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of the two Taipei pavilions at
Shanghai World Expo 2010.</P>
      <P>Construction of the 375-square-meter area for the two Taipei pavilions, which
will highlight Taipei's achievements in building a ubiquitous broadband wireless
network and in trash recycling, is scheduled to begin Friday.</P>
      <P>Lee described her trip to Shanghai as an endeavor to link the Taipei flora expo
and the Shanghai World Expo.</P>
      <P>"The city government will highlight our advantages at the Shanghai World Expo to
let Chinese citizens and people around the world know Taipei has one of the best
living and travel environments for backpackers, young students and
intellectuals," she said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, she said, Yabi the Seed Baby is expected to meet Haibao -- the
official mascot of Shanghai World Expo 2010 -- during the visit in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Both mascots were designed by Taiwanese, Lee disclosed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Sculpture park keeps memory of Chiang Kai-shek alive</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/29/09  15:57:51</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than three decades after his death, Chiang Kai-shek, the man, the legend,
the hero or the villain, may have become irrelevant to the majority of young
people in a vastly changed Taiwan. But the Taoyuan County government has been
working to preserve the memory of the late president by establishing a park that
features scores of his sculptures.</P>
      <P>"I didn't know much about President Chiang Kai-shek until I joined the staff of
the county government," said 26-year-old Liu Ya-ping who works in the Taoyuan
County government's press liaison section.</P>
      <P>Cihu Sculpture Memorial Park, close to Chiang's final resting place and the site
of what was known as his favorite holiday resort, was established in Taoyuan
County in 1997.</P>
      <P>Scattered throughout the park are more than 150 statues of Chiang in full
figure, bust, seated, standing, and one astride a horse. They were collected
from schools, cultural centers, government offices, military bases and business
establishments around the island.</P>
      <P>They had been pulled down between 2006 and 2007 by the then government of the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in a campaign to get rid of the vestiges of
Chiang's legacy in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"When it was established, the park at first did not attract much attention until
after 2000 when the new DPP government launched its anti- Chiang movement and
many statues of the late president were removed from schools and government
establishments to the Cihu park," said Liu as she gave a guided tour of the
area.</P>
      <P>Pointing to the largest seated statue in the park, Liu said the cracks in the
bronze piece look like wounds all over Chiang's body and symbolize the political
reality in Taiwan over the past years.</P>
      <P>The giant statue had occupied a prominent spot in the lobby of the Kaohsiung
Cultural Center for years, but in February 2000 the Kaohsiung County Government
decided it should be removed.</P>
      <P>The statue was dismantled by the city government, under the leadership of
incumbent Mayor Chen Chu, in the wee hours of March 14, 2007 and it was agreed
that it would be sent to the Cihu park.</P>
      <P>"The Taoyuan County Government was more than happy to accept the statue, but did
not expect that it would arrive in Cihu years later in more than 200 pieces,"
said Liu.</P>
      <P>When  the  8-meter  high  piece  was  dismembered,  fierce confrontations broke
out between those who cherished the memory of the late president as a strong
leader who helped the people of Taiwan weather many storms and those who saw him
as a symbol of totalitarian rule.</P>
      <P>"The dismemberment, even of a statue, was considered much too cruel and it
attracted immense media coverage," Liu said.</P>
      <P>However, the media blitz afforded greater publicity for Cihu Sculpture Memorial
Park, which was to be the new home of the statue, she added.</P>
      <P>When the Taoyuan County Government received the pile of scrap metal in 2007, it
set about finding the technical expertise and financial support to restore the
piece.</P>
      <P>One year later, on March 15, 2008, the reassembled statue was unveiled at the
sculpture park, but the cracks in the metal were apparent, rendering the look of
a severely wounded Chiang.</P>
      <P>"This is the most photographed statue in the park, probably because of its size,
and probably because of the 'scars' it bears, " said Liu.</P>
      <P>The park has been drawing increasing numbers of visitors from around the island,
and also tourists from abroad, including many from mainland China.</P>
      <P>"In much the same way that the Berlin Wall was a symbol of the Cold War, the
sculpture park and its surroundings signify some very important years in
contemporary Chinese history, " said Eddy Chang, director-general of Taoyuan
County government's Tourism Promotion Department.</P>
      <P>For more than two decades, the "Cave Hotel" in Back Cihu, hidden among the
trees, was where Chiang and his family celebrated his birthday each year, Chang
noted.</P>
      <P>The late president named the area Cihu -- which means compassionate lake -- in
memory of his mother and because it reminded him of his hometown in Zhejiang
Province in China.</P>
      <P>Back Cihu was also a command post from which Chiang planned to launch a
counterattack against the Chinese Communists and stage his return to the
mainland, declassified documents have revealed.</P>
      <P>Chiang and his Kuomintang forces withdrew from the Chinese mainland to Taiwan in
1949 after they lost the Chinese civil war to the communists.</P>
      <P>The Chiang residence on a small hill in Back Cihu and the nearby pond and forest
paths are now open to the public, although only 600 visitors per day are allowed
to enter the resort.</P>
      <P>In the Cultural Resort of the Chiangs, "from the sculpture park to the Back Cihu
residence, memories of Chiang Kai-shek abound, and Taoyuan County will try to
preserve them in the hope that visitors will appreciate their importance," Chang
said.</P>

      <P>Riding on its success in showing off an innovative temple fair dance at the
opening of the Kaohsiung World Games 2009, the government of Taiwan's southern
port city Kaohsiung is now planning to promote the dance at the world-renowned
Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the biggest arts festival in the world.</P>
      <P>The innovative temple fair dance involves "Seven-Star" steps that used to be
danced by Taoist deity sedan-chair carriers during religious festivals and is
accompanied by loud traditional temple tunes and dazzling neon lights.</P>
      <P>It was an instant attention grabber during the opening ceremony of the World
Games in Kaohsiung City on July 16.</P>
      <P>The more than 50,000 audience members, many of whom were foreigners, were amazed
by the dance, billed by the city government as the "Taike Dance" because of the
strong Taiwanese folklore characteristics surrounding it, said Shih Jhe,
director-general of the Kaohsiung City Bureau of Cultural Affairs.</P>
      <P>The bureau is planning to organize a Taike Dance company and have it trained
regularly so that it can represent Kaohsiung City at the next Edinburgh Festival
Fringe, to be held in August 2010, Shih said.</P>
      <P>To further attract interest in the dance, Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu is inviting
Kaohsiung residents and people from other cities and counties to join her for a
record-setting event where some 100,000 people are expected to be dancing the
"Taike Dance" at Kaohsiung's Lotus Pond around 2 p.m. on Nov. 1, according to

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou vowed Thursday to find a balance between Taiwanese
people's health and the country's international creditability after the
government decided last week to open its door wider to U.S. beef products, to
the criticism of some people in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Finding a balance between the Taiwan people's health and the country's efforts
to participate in the international arena is the government's top mission," Ma
stressed.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks at the Presidential Office when receiving a group of
Taiwanese business people and Taiwan-based foreign trade officials recognized as
outstanding this year.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the controversy arising from the U.S. beef issue, Ma said the
government fully respects the initiatives launched by the private sector to
boycott some of the U.S. beef products that will soon be allowed into Taiwan in
line with a protocol inked by Taiwan and the United States on Oct. 22 in
Washington, D.C. to lift a partial ban on U.S. beef imports.</P>
      <P>"If the private sector can take the initiative to screen the stuff they want, it
will help spare the government from re-opening the talks with the United States
and help avoid hurting Taiwan's international creditability," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Still, Ma tried reassured the public about the safety of the beef products from
the United States.</P>
      <P>According to the president, the U.S. side will control its beef product quality
from the origin, while Taiwan's veterinarians are entitled to conduct checkups
at designated slaughterhouses in the United States.</P>
      <P>"The United States will be responsible for effective management of its beef in
the very beginning, while the Taiwan government will be accountable for the same
issue on the borderland, " the president explained.</P>
      <P>"This sort of quality control mechanism  is the strictest management ever seen."</P>
      <P>Ma said Taiwan could not turn down the United States' demand to hold
negotiations on the issue in abidance of the norms of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) , but throughout the whole negotiation process, government
officials did stick to the principle of security and safety.</P>
      <P>"The terms obtained in the negotiating table should be enough to help protect
Taiwan nationals' health, " he said. "This is the reason behind the government's
decision to relax restrictions on the importation of U.S. beef."</P>
      <P>Under the new pact, U.S. bone-in beef, ground beef, offal, brains, and processed
beef from cattle younger than 30 months and that have not been contaminated with
"specific risk materials" will be permitted to enter Taiwan starting Nov. 10.</P>
      <P>Specific risk materials are defined in the protocol as brains, skulls, eyes,
trigeminal ganglia, spinal cords, vertebral columns and dorsal root ganglia from
cattle 30 months of age and older, or tonsils and the distal ileum of the small
intestine from cattle of all ages.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan only allows imports of U.S. boneless beef from cattle younger
than 30 months that contain no specified risk materials.</P>
      <P>Turning to foreign affairs, Ma hailed the results of a flexible diplomacy
strategy adopted by his administration after he assumed the presidency in May
last year, to increase Taiwan's international presence and improve ties with
China.</P>
      <P>Citing as an example, the president said it is possible that the European Union
will grant visa-free treatment to Taiwanese citizens next year. Ma also
expressed hope of seeing concrete results next year from an economic cooperation
framework  agreement  being negotiated between Taiwan and China.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Thursday that U. S. beef offal and ground beef will not
appear in Taiwan's markets, despite the government's decision last week to open
its door wider to U.S. beef products.</P>
      <P>According to Executive Yuan spokesperson Su Jun-pin, Premier Wu asked DOH Bureau
of Food Safety at a Cabinet meeting Thursday to assist U.S. beef importers to
form an association as a second tier regulator to enhance supervision and
control of the beef imports.</P>
      <P>Su also quoted Wu saying that the issue regarding U.S. beef imports is not
necessarily about just health risks or food safety, it is all about consumer
concerns, so the government needs to face it seriously.</P>
      <P>However, Wu said the government has no plans to resume talks with the United
States on beef imports for now, Su added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's Health Minister Yaung Chih-liang said that the government
will immediately stop U.S. beef imports if even just one case of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) , or mad cow disease, is found in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yaung made the remarks while responding to a question by ruling Kuomingtang
(KMT) legislator at a legislative committee meeting.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang meanwhile also clarified at the
legislative meeting that during talks with the U.S. on beef imports, there were
no other terms or conditions attached to the deal.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level DOH announced on Oct. 23 that Taiwan would expand market
access for U.S. beef after officials of the two countries clinched an accord the
previous day in Washington, D.C., to lift a ban.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the new accord, U.S. bone-in beef, ground beef, intestines,
brains, spinal cords and processed beef from cattle younger than 30 months that
have not been contaminated with "specific risk materials" will be allowed to
enter Taiwan starting Nov. 10.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Recycling of polylactic acid containers to be introduced in 2010</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) will implement a system next
March to recycle polylactic acid (PLA) containers in order to cut down on
pollution, EPA Minister Stephen Shu-hung Shen said Thursday.</P>
      <P>At a question-and-answer session in the legislature, Shen said that the EPA will
ask drink manufacturers to clearly mark bottles and containers made from PLA, so
that recyclers would be able to identify and differentiate between PLA
containers and other recyclable items.</P>
      <P>Ho Shun-chin,  director of the EPA's Department  of Waste Management, said that
by the end of November the EPA will officially list PLA containers as recyclable
items and will complete arrangements for a PLA recycling system by March 1,
2010.</P>
      <P>Noting that the current production volume of PLA is 15 million tons a year, Ho
said that the EPA will urge PLA manufacturers to set up recycling centers for
the material in cities and counties around the country.</P>
      <P>The officials were responding  to a comment by opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) Legislator Huang Sue-ying that since the EPA launched a green policy
in 2003, it has asked supermarkets and hypermarkets to reduce the use of plastic
bags and conventional plastic containers, which has led to a significant
increase in the use of the fully biodegradable PLA.</P>
      <P>So far, more than 70 percent of the containers on the market are made from PLA,
but there is no recycling system in place for that material, according to Huang.</P>
      <P>PLA, a plastic substitute made from fermented corn starch, is usually used to
make transparent containers for food, and looks like the petroleum-based
plastics.</P>
      <P>PLA is biodegradable, but can only be broken down under specific temperature
conditions and cannot be recycled along with other items, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Another major problem is the lack of recycling symbols on PLA containers for
their disposal, Huang said, noting that they are usually incinerated or buried.</P>

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials
Thursday:</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>It is time to pierce the bubble about the trade pact with China</P>
      <P>Ma's administration is speeding up its negotiations with China on the proposed
economic cooperation framework agreement as the domestic opposition to it is
mounting.</P>
      <P>Beijing is responding favorably to Ma's approach by claiming that it is ready
for such talks during the forthcoming cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>If Ma's negotiations on beef with Washington is anything to go by, we are sure
the people will be sold out again in his negotiations on the trade pact with
China.</P>
      <P>For example, Chinese banks can easily squeeze their Taiwan counterparts out of
the market through their strong economic strength, if they were allowed to
operate in Taiwan. It will be the holocaust of Taiwan's financial institutions.</P>
      <P>So it's time for the public to rise in arms to stop Ma from concluding a trade
pact with China.</P>
      <P>Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>The most imperious AIT chief in history</P>
      <P>William Stanton, head of the American Institute in Taiwan Taipei Office, claimed
that 1,034 Taiwanese were killed in motorcycle accidents in Taiwan in last year,
far more than the number of people who have died from mad cow disease worldwide,
therefore Taiwanese should stop riding motorcycles because it far more dangerous
than eating U.S. beef.</P>
      <P>Stanton obviously is not aware that what matters is not death, but the fear that
U.S. beef could present a risk of mad cow disease. Isn't freedom from fear a
right advocated by the U.S.' late President Franklin Roosevelt?</P>
      <P>The diplomat's argument smacks of U.S. arrogance and hemogony and has offended
even the members of Democratic Progressive Party who are the U.S.' most staunch
supporters in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma's administration should not be blamed for agreeing to import of U.S. bone-in
beef, if the decision was meant obtain U.S. concessions on other fronts.</P>
      <P>Stanton's arrogant defense of U.S. beef would only disgust and repel local
consumers.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Is the U.S. trying to take advantage of Taiwan's situation to make money?</P>
      <P>Taiwan authorities' decision to lift the ban on imports of U.S. bone-in beef is
threatening to mushroom into a crisis, as several local governments have vowed
to boycott the controversial beef imports.</P>
      <P>Although the Taiwan authorities have only themselves to blame for failing to
inform the public clearly of their negotiations with Washington, the U.S. is the
real culprit for forcing Taiwan to lift the ban.</P>
      <P>It would be understandable if Taiwan gave in to the U.S. request in exchange for
Washington's promise to resume trade talks with Taiwan, which would be a step
toward a free trade agreement.</P>
      <P>In a related development, Washington has raised the price of some of the
weaponry system that Taiwan is eager to buy, which puts the already debt-ridden
Taiwan government under heavy financial pressure.</P>
      <P>We won't blame Washington for trying to make money, but if its selfish approach
forces Taiwan to move closer to China and tilt the balance between Washington
and Beijing, will that serve the U.S.' interests?</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>If Brother Elephants are resolved....</P>
      <P>What a disappointment to local baseball fans who had seen with enthusiasm the
17-inning showdown between Brothers Elephants and Uni-President Lions for the
season's title only to find that several top players were probed for game-
rigging.</P>
      <P>It is the fifth game-rigging scandal which has tarnished the image of the
Chinese Professional Baseball League in its 20-year history.</P>
      <P>All the fans are now waiting for is that the scandal is groundless, and the
players involved in the allegations will tell them soundly that they had never
thrown games.</P>
      <P>This is an annus mirabilis for Taiwan baseball fans who had seen their hero Wang
Chien-ming withdrawing from the New York Yankees for injuries and the scandal
shrouding the Chinese Professional Baseball League.</P>
      <P>It is the onus of the government to protect the baseball players from being
intimated by gangsters, and the onus of the players to reject gangsters
pecuniary temptations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is hardly big enough to afford a professional baseball league, but for
the enthusiasm of local fans. If the players of Brother Elephants being
investigated are found guilty of match fixing, that could spell the demise of
Brother Elephants and would be tantamount to the death of the league.</P>
      <P>Has Taiwan debased itself to this extent?</P>

Association, on behalf of the Shanghai Municipal Tourism Administration, signed
a "strategic cooperative partnership" agreement with Cheng Kuang-yuan, president
of Eva Air, Thursday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement stimulus measures will be introduced to encourage tours to
the Shanghai Expo, the Yangtze River Delta area and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that Eva Air, together with its affiliate Uni Air, are leading all
Taiwanese air companies by operating 50 weekly flights to 14 destinations in
China. He noted that 24 of those flights are between Taiwan and the mainland
cities of Shanghai, Hangzhou, Ningbo in the delta area.</P>
      <P>Besides, he added, the Eva group operates 42 two-way flights between Taiwan and
North America area every week, which makes it easy for tourists from that area
to link China and Taiwan in their travel itineraries.</P>
      <P>Su said that the Shanghai Expo, scheduled to be held May 1 through Oct. 31 next
year, is expected to attract around 70 million visitors, and the Eva group has
been chosen as a strategic partner of the event because of its excellent flight
safety record.</P>
      <P>The package tour will become available in the first quarter of next year. (By

      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) will be one of the exhibitors at
the Taipei International Travel Fair 2009 which opens this week, as it hopes to
promote leisure travel to Taiwan's farms and rural attractions.</P>
      <P>At its booth at the Oct. 30-Nov. 2 travel fair -- to be held in Hall 1 of the
Taipei World Trade Center -- the COA will put forth 19 tour packages to allow
visitors to tour farms and savor signature agricultural products in rural areas.</P>
      <P>The tours will allow visitors to take forest walks to breathe in the smell of
plants, take trips to the wild to appreciate the beauty of Mother Nature and
gain a better understanding of wildlife, COA officials said.</P>
      <P>Of the 19 packages, five will be tours to areas hardest hit by the typhoons this
year. The tours, at a bargain price of NT$168 (US$5.2) per person, are aimed at
allowing the visitors to better understand the impact that typhoon victims have
sustained on one hand and to help revive the local economies on the other, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>A total of 15 agricultural areas and six farming communities around the country
have pitched in to support the COA programs aimed at bolstering local economies
through tourism.</P>
      <P>Taking weekend or longer trips to farms and other areas in Taiwan's countryside
has grown in popularity in recent years.</P>
      <P>According to COA tallies, the number of people in Taiwan making leisure tours to
farms and rural areas has increased by 50 folds from 1,300 in 2004 to some
63,700 in 2008.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan mulling ways to stop internal party election bribery</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Ministry of the Interior (MOI) will push for passage of a "political
party law" to regulate internal party elections, Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah
said Thursday in the wake of alleged rampant vote-buying during the ruling
Kuomintang's recent election.</P>
      <P>The minister made the declaration after President Ma Ying-jeou said in a recent
interview with a local magazine "The Journalist" that he supports developing
legislation for a political party law to incriminate those who commit vote-
buying or bribery in elections for political party positions.</P>
      <P>Before the enactment of a political party law, Ma said the government may also
consider revising the existing Public Officials Election and Recall Law to
regulate intraparty elections in order to prevent  such elections  from being
tarnished  by bribery  or vote-buying.</P>
      <P>The president further said in the interview that regardless of whether the new
regulations will be integrated into the proposed Political Party Act or in the
revised election and recall law, prison terms should be included as punitive
measures for those who are convicted of vote-buying in elections for political
party posts.</P>
      <P>Ma, who doubles as chairman of the KMT, said that without clear legal
regulations to incriminate those who commit vote-buying in elections inside
political parties, his administration's lofty goals of political reform and
elimination of official corruption cannot be realized.</P>
      <P>Ma's statement came amid criticism that the latest elections for the KMT's
decision-making Central Standing Committee (CSC) was marred by rampant bribery.</P>
      <P>Echoing Ma's call, some lawmakers have also proposed that elections for
political party positions and party primaries for public office elections be put
under regulations of the planned Political Party Act or the existing Public
Officials Election and Recall Law.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Jiang noted that the Public Officials Election and Recall Law
already stipulates that no bribery is allowed in party primaries for public
office elections.</P>
      <P>As to elections for political party chairmanship and other party posts, Jiang
said, relevant regulations should be incorporated into the proposed Political
Party Act which he said his ministry is still working on.</P>
      <P>"Interior ministry officials are studying relevant legislation and legal
revision  issues and will keep close contact  with legislative caucuses of the
ruling and opposition parties in the process, " Jiang said, adding that his
ministry will endeavor to seek a social consensus on the anti-vote-buying cause.</P>
      <P>Responding to complaints by opposition Democratic Progressive Party legislators
at a legislative session later in the day that some police officers helped with
vote canvassing before the KMT's Oct. 11 CSC elections, Jiang said such acts
were not done during police officers' working hours.</P>
      <P>"The proposed Political Party Act will strictly prohibit such acts and before
the law is enacted, I will issue official letters to ask all ministry staff to
refrain from being involved in any political party elections," Jiang added.</P>
      <P>In an indication of its determination to wipe out corruption and establish clean
politics, the KMT kicked two members from the CSC for their involvement in vote-
buying during the election and all of the remaining members of the committee
have decided to relinquish their CSC posts following Ma's open encouragement.</P>
      <P>As a result, the KMT has decided to elect new CSC members on Nov. 14 and 75
hopefuls have registered their candidacy for the election. But only 73 of the
hopefuls meet all requirements to run in the election, according to party
sources.</P>

      <P>The friendship between Taiwan and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has become
ever-stronger after many years of cooperation between the two countries, Prime
Minister Ralph Gonsalves said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Addressing the inauguration  of a national library in the Caribbean country
constructed using funds from Taiwan, Gonsalves said the biggest public library
in the Caribbean region is the best testimony to the friendship between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>Gonsalves also expressed his thanks to Taiwan for its assistance with several
other infrastructure projects, including the country's Youth Empowerment Service
(YES) program, which has been rated as the best model program worthy of
emulation by other countries in the region by the Inter-American Development
Bank and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's
(UNESCO's) Latin American regional office.</P>
      <P>The program is geared toward the economic and personal skills and the social
enhancement of unemployed young people.</P>
      <P>Examination Yuan President John Kuan, who was visiting Saint Vincent and the
Grenadines for the country's 30th anniversary of independence, also attended the
ceremony.</P>
      <P>Kuan said that assisting Taiwan's allies in strengthening the development of
their human resources has been included in his government's white paper on
foreign aid policy published in May and that the library's establishment marks
the fulfillment of the principles covered in the white paper.</P>
      <P>Kuan also said that Taiwan will stick to its promise to continue with bilateral
cooperative programs.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih Thursday ordered the establishment of a new energy promotion
committee in a bid to turn Taiwan into a leading country in the development of
new energy.</P>
      <P>The premier issued the instruction at a weekly Cabinet meeting after hearing a
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) report on an action  plan for the green
energy  industry,  said Government Information Office Minister Su Jun-pin
following the meeting.</P>
      <P>Wu said that Taiwan, with a solid foundation paved by its powerful semiconductor
industry, has a great advantage for developing green and other new energies.</P>
      <P>However, the premier said there is still a great challenge for Taiwan if it
wants to achieve the goal set for the country's new energy industry of attaining
over NT$1 trillion (US$31.3 billion) in production value over the next six
years, which currently stands at around NT$169 billion.</P>
      <P>Wu said the new committee, to be headed by Minister Without Portfolio Liang Chi-
yuan, should work toward excluding all the obstacles to make Taiwan a leading
country in terms of new energy technology and new energy production.</P>
      <P>The MOEA action plan lists sonar-optic, hydrogen and wind energy, ecological
fuels, energy information and communication technology and electric vehicles as
the major items for priority development, with the aim of "leading Taiwan's
industry to transfer to areas with lower carbon emissions and high value."</P>
      <P>The MOEA hopes that with breakthroughs in expertise, increased investment,
enlarged exports and domestic demand, the production value of the new energy
industry will have reached NT$1.15 trillion by 2015. (By Lee Ming-tsung and Bear

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih told the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) Thursday to consider
setting up a grandparents day as a "national holiday."</P>
      <P>According to Executive Yuan spokesman Su Jun-pin, Premier Wu Den-yih asked the
MOI at a Cabinet meeting to select a non-work day for a grandparents day so that
it will not affect production and industrial development.</P>
      <P>Wu said the day should be differentiated from the existing traditional Chong
Yang festival for the elderly, which is celebrated on the ninth day of the ninth
lunar month.</P>
      <P>Education Minister Wu Ching-chi also said at the meeting that setting up such a
day would not only help enhance family ethics but also help boost consumption
and domestic demand, Su added.</P>
      <P>In a move to enhance care for the elderly, the Executive Yuan approved in
September a budget of NT$7.5 billion (US$230 million) for an elderly care
program.</P>
      <P>Under the program, the MOI plans to have implemented 63 projects by the end of
2011 to improve services to low-income elderly, strengthen the health care
system and the "friendly environment" for the elderly, and encourage the elderly
to participate in social activities.</P>
      <P>The population of citizens aged 65 and above had reached over 2.4 million by the
end of 2008 -- 10.43 percent of the overall population of the country --
according to the MOI. By 2025, Taiwan is expected to be classed as a "super-aged
society, " by which time the population of senior citizens will have reached
4.81 million -- about 20 percent of the country's population.</P>

      <P>Although more and more classes around the country are being suspended amid the
rapid spread of influenza A(H1N1) , the Central Epidemics Command Center (CECC)
said Thursday that the guidelines regulating class closures will not be changed.</P>
      <P>Based on the "325" guidelines published on Aug. 18, classes at kindergartens,
primary schools, and junior and senior high schools, as well as cram schools and
day-care centers, must be closed for five days to prevent cluster infections if
any two students in the same class are diagnosed with H1N1 within three days,
the CECC said in a press release.</P>
      <P>Institutes or facilities caught failing to follow the guidelines will be subject
to disciplinary action by local governments, the CECC said.</P>
      <P>According to CECC statistics, a total of 919 classes at 439 schools nationwide
had been closed as of the previous day, accounting for 0.67 percent of the
total. To date, there have been 454 hospitalization cases of influenza A(H1N1),
or swine flu, including 27 deaths and 33 people remaining in hospital.</P>
      <P>As of Tuesday, 809 classes at 427 schools around the country had remained closed
due to H1N1 infections among the students.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Pin-lin Elementary School in northern Taiwan's Taipei County
announced that the whole school had been shut down for five days a day earlier,
making it the second school to do so on the orders of the county's education
bureau following the closure of the Pin-lin Junior High School.</P>
      <P>Twenty eight of the 223 students at the Pin-lin Elementary School had been
confirmed as having contracted H1N1.</P>
      <P>The increased spread of swine flu among students has led to mounting pressure on
parents, many of whom are having to take time off work to take care of their
children, while teachers are also facing greater pressure to conduct make-up
classes on holidays.</P>

      <P>With China leading the global economic recovery, two-way trade across the Taiwan
Strait is regaining momentum steadily and Taiwan's export reliance on China has
risen correspondingly, government sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>In August, Taiwan's exports to China reached US$6.09 billion, an 11-month high
since the global financial crisis hit its peak last September, the Bureau of
Foreign Trade (BOFT) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs said in a press
statement.</P>
      <P>Despite a rebound in shipments to China month-on-month, August's export amount
still marked a 17.7 percent  decline  from the year-earlier level because of an
export boom that ran until August 2008, the statement said, adding that the
year-on-year export decrease for the month was the smallest in 11 months.</P>
      <P>China's fast economic recovery has led to an increase in Taiwan's exports to
China, the statement went on, adding that China accounted for 32 percent  of
Taiwan's  total  exports  in August,  the second-highest in cross-strait trade
history. The highest rate was registered in September 2007, when the ratio hit
32.5 percent.</P>
      <P>The BOFT statement further said that although Taiwan's overall exports to China
showed negative growth in August, some key export items posted gains. For
instance, IC chip sales marked a 15 percent increase compared with the previous
month.</P>
      <P>In August, Taiwan's trade surplus with China hit a 12-month high of US$3.93
billion, the statement added.</P>

      <P>Guy Ledoux, head of the Taipei-based European Economic and Trade Office, told

      <P>A wide range of special offers will be offered at the Taipei International
Travel Fair (ITF) 2009 set to open at the Taipei World Trade Center Friday, as
local tourism operators attempt to reverse the downturn in the sector due to the
swine flu epidemic and the effects of Typhoon Morakot, an event organizer said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>This year, a record high of 1,206 booths will be set up by operators from 58
countries during the four-day fair, according to Stanley Chang-shou Yen.</P>
      <P>Of the total, 256 booths will be promoting the World Expo 2010 Shanghai, Yen
added.</P>
      <P>The fair offers a good opportunity for visitors to hunt for bargains and get
first-hand information and tips on travel in various countries, he added.</P>
      <P>In recent years, individual tours have become an increasingly popular form of
travel among young people worldwide, Yen noted, while encouraging those
interested in planning this form of tourism to visit the fair to gather
information for their travel plans.</P>
      <P>Between last July and this July, the number of Taiwanese tourists visiting China
reached about 4.75 million, more than half of a total of 8 million overseas
visits made last year by Taiwanese people, Taiwan Visitors Association Chairman
Chou Ching-hsiung said.</P>
      <P>Between last July, when restrictions on visits to Taiwan by people from China
were relaxed, and the end of September, Chinese people made more than 885,000
visits to Taiwan, making China Taiwan's second-biggest source of visitors,
second only to Japan, according to statistics.</P>
      <P>In addition, the number of Hong Kong tourists visiting Taiwan has reached
540,000 so far this year, up 15 percent year-on- year, according to Yen.</P>
      <P>Backpackers form the largest group of visitors to Taiwan, who are attracted by

      <P>Two professional baseball players of the Brother Elephants team admitted
Thursday to being involved in game-fixing.</P>
      <P>Wang Chin-li and Wu Pau-hsien made their confessions while being questioned by
prosecutors of the Banciao District Prosecutors Office in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>An investigation into professional baseball game-fixing had been snowballing
over the past few days since nine players were summoned and eight named as
defendants after questioning a day earlier. More players were summoned Thursday
evening.</P>
      <P>Wang and Wu were the only two detained for further questioning and were released
early Thursday after confessing their involvement.</P>
      <P>Among the eight defendants, six are members of the Brother Elephants, including
Wang, Wu, Tsao Chin-hui, Liu Yu-chan, Li Hao-jen and Wang Chun-tai. Hsieh Chia-
hsien of the Sinon Bulls and Chang Chih-chia of the La New Bears have also been
implicated.</P>
      <P>Brother Elephants manager Hung Jui-he suggested last year that the team would be
disbanded if any players were proven to have engaged in game-fixing. With six
players listed as defendants by prosecutors, the future of Brother Elephants is
of grave concern of baseball fans, as Hung reiterated his comments after his
players were summoned by prosecutors.</P>
      <P>Minister of Sports Affairs Dai Hsia-ling also expressed concern about Hung's
decision. Noting the team's contributions to Taiwan's professional baseball

      <P>If Taiwan's newly signed protocol with the United States on opening its market
wider to U.S. beef from cattle younger than 30 months is an international
treaty, it should be approved by the Legislative Yuan before it takes effect, a
legislative official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Liu Han-ting, head of the Legislative Yuan's Organic Laws and Statutes Bureau,
made the remarks while fielding questions at a legislative committee session.</P>
      <P>During the session, ruling Kuomintang Legislator Lu Hsueh-chang said that as the
new Taiwan-U.S. beef trade protocol is closely related to the people's rights
and health, it should be screened by the legislature.</P>
      <P>According to a previous ruling by the Council of Grand Justices, Liu said,
written documents signed with a foreign country, regardless of its designation
or name, should be screened by the legislature if its provisions are related to
the people's rights or concern national interests and major affairs.</P>
      <P>Even if the new protocol is merely an administrative accord, it should still be
sent to the legislature, according to Liu.</P>
      <P>"But so far, we have not yet received any document or notice from the executive
branch," Liu added.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) announced Oct. 23 that Taiwan would
expand market access for U.S. beef after officials of the two countries clinched
an accord the previous day in Washington, D.C., to lift a partial ban on U.S.
beef imports.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the new accord, U.S. bone-in beef, ground beef, intestines,
brains, spinal cords and processed beef from cattle younger than 30 months that
have not been contaminated with "specific risk materials" will be allowed to
enter Taiwan starting Nov. 10.</P>
      <P>Specific risk materials are defined in the protocol as brains, skulls, eyes,
trigeminal ganglia, spinal cords, vertebral columns and dorsal root ganglia from
cattle 30 months of age and older, or tonsils and the distal ileum of the small
intestine from cattle of all ages.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan only allows imports of U.S. boneless beef from cattle younger
than 30 months that contain no specified risk materials.</P>
      <P>The new market-opening decision has since drawn flak from opposition parties,
consumer rights activists, lawmakers and even city and county officials.</P>
      <P>In the face of mounting criticism, Premier Wu Den-yih said Thursday that the
government will see to it that U.S. beef offal and ground beef does not appear
on Taiwan's market, but he did not elaborate on technical details.</P>
      <P>DOH Minister Yaung Chih-liang also said the same day that if U.S. beef offal and
ground beef is shipped to Taiwan, his department will inspect each case to check
whether the products are contaminated with any bacteria or viruses and said any
products that fail the inspections will not be allowed to enter the local
market.</P>

      <P>The chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) proposed Thursday that
cross-Taiwan Strait media exchanges be included on the agenda of talks between
Taiwan and China next year.</P>
      <P>Chiang Pin-kung, who was in Beijing as the head of a Taiwanese media delegation,
made the call while meeting Wang Yi, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under
China's State Council.</P>
      <P>Wang in return said that for the foreseeable future, cross-strait talks should
remain focused on economic issues, but he added that issues related to news and
cultural exchanges could be "gradually" included in the agenda of future talks.</P>
      <P>The SEF and its Chinese counterpart,  the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , are semi-official intermediary bodies set up
respectively by Taiwan and China to deal with cross-strait affairs in the
absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS have held three rounds of talks over the past year or so and
have reached nine agreements aimed at increasing cross-strait trade and economic
exchanges.</P>
      <P>A fourth round of talks will take place in December in Taichung, central Taiwan,
when both sides are expected to sign four agreements regarding  fishing  crew
cooperation,  agricultural  quarantine inspection,  industrial  product
standards,  inspection  and certification, and the avoidance of double taxation.</P>
      <P>The media delegation is comprised of executives from 15 Taiwanese news media
outlets, as well as officials of the SEF and the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC).</P>
      <P>Earlier  in the day,  the delegation  visited the General Administration of
Press and Publication, the Xinhua news agency and the People's Daily for
exchanges of views on cross-strait news coverage.</P>
      <P>The delegation also visited Jia Qinglin, chairman of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference, ARATS President Chen Yunlin, and the State
Administration of Radio, Film and Television (SARFT) soon after its arrival in
Beijing the previous day.</P>
      <P>The delegation was scheduled to visit the city of Shanxi Friday before returning
to Taiwan Sunday.</P>
      <P>In related news, MAC Vice Chairman Liu Te-hsun urged China to consider
reciprocal treatment for Taiwan's TV stations while asking Taiwan to allow
programs of China Central Television (CCTV) to be broadcast in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks in response to reports that MAC Vice Chairman Chao Chien-
min, who is a member of the media delegation in his capacity as a SEF board
director, said while meeting SARFT officials that CCTV will have no problem
gaining a Taiwanese audience.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou instructed the education authorities Thursday to make
efforts to retain Taiwan's excellent students in domestic colleges and
universities.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while meeting a group of winners of the 2009 International
Olympiad competitions in physics and mathematics at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>He was referring to recent moves by the University of Hong Kong and the City
University of Hong Kong to recruit Taiwanese students by offering a series of
privileges including free tuition and dormitory accommodation, as well as
subsidized living costs.</P>
      <P>Saying that many other universities in France and the United States are
following suit, Ma told the Ministry of Education to address the issue to
prevent an exodus of Taiwan's best students.</P>
      <P>"We are not opposed to studying abroad, but we just cannot let most of our
excellent  youngsters  pursue studies  in foreign countries," said Ma.</P>
      <P>He added that despite budget constraints, the government still allocated NT$10
billion for 2010 to help domestic universities upgrade their academic levels in
a bid to push them into the ranks of the world's top universities.</P>
      <P>Although the investment is still far less than that made by the governments of
Japan, South Korea and Singapore, it is still enough to prevent Taiwan's
universities from lagging too far behind their foreign counterparts, according
to Ma.</P>

      <P>Officials from Taiwan's animal health inspection bureau said Thursday that the
bureau will post officials in the United States to check the quality of U.S.
beef and beef products that are to be delivered to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine under the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture came up with the decision after the
Legislative Yuan's Economics Committee passed a resolution earlier in the day
that the quarantine bureau and the Cabinet-level Department of Health should
post officials in the United States.</P>
      <P>Those  officials  should  carry  out  regular  checks  of slaughterhouses and
other meat product facilities whose beef and beef products will be sold to
Taiwan to ensure that their products are free from bacterial or viral
contamination.</P>
      <P>The bureau said in a press statement that one of its staff members already
stationed in the United States is in fact a veterinarian who is qualified to
check the quality of U.S. beef and related products before they are delivered to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If he finds that the meat processing plants do not meet the requirements set
forth in the trade protocol signed by the two countries, the veterinarian is
under instructions to report the case back to Taiwan, the statement added.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih told the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) Thursday to consider
setting up a grandparents day as a "national holiday."</P>
      <P>According to Executive Yuan spokesman Su Jun-pin, Premier Wu Den-yih asked the
MOI at a Cabinet meeting to select a non-work day for a grandparents day so that
it will not affect production and industrial development.</P>
      <P>Wu said the day should be differentiated from the existing traditional Chong
Yang festival for the elderly, which is celebrated on the ninth day of the ninth
lunar month.</P>
      <P>Education Minister Wu Ching-chi also said at the meeting that setting up such a
day would not only help enhance family ethics but also help boost consumption
and domestic demand, Su added.</P>
      <P>In a move to enhance care for the elderly, the Executive Yuan approved in
September a budget of NT$7.5 billion (US$230 million) for an elderly care
program.</P>
      <P>Under the program, the MOI plans to have implemented 63 projects by the end of
2011 to improve services to low-income elderly, strengthen the health care
system and the "friendly environment" for the elderly, and encourage the elderly
to participate in social activities.</P>
      <P>The population of citizens aged 65 and above had reached over 2.4 million by the
end of 2008 -- 10.43 percent of the overall population of the country --
according to the MOI. By 2025, Taiwan is expected to be classed as a "super-aged
society, " by which time the population of senior citizens will have reached
4.81 million -- about 20 percent of the country's population.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Number of classes shut down over swine flu shows sharp rise</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although more and more classes around the country are being suspended amid the
rapid spread of influenza A(H1N1) , the Central Epidemics Command Center (CECC)
said Thursday that the guidelines regulating class closures will not be changed.</P>
      <P>Based on the "325" guidelines published on Aug. 18, classes at kindergartens,
primary schools, and junior and senior high schools, as well as cram schools and
day-care centers, must be closed for five days to prevent cluster infections if
any two students in the same class are diagnosed with H1N1 within three days,
the CECC said in a press release.</P>
      <P>Institutes or facilities caught failing to follow the guidelines will be subject
to disciplinary action by local governments, the CECC said.</P>
      <P>According to CECC statistics, a total of 919 classes at 439 schools nationwide
had been closed as of the previous day, accounting for 0.67 percent of the
total. To date, there have been 454 hospitalization cases of influenza A(H1N1),
or swine flu, including 27 deaths and 33 people remaining in hospital.</P>
      <P>As of Tuesday, 809 classes at 427 schools around the country had remained closed
due to H1N1 infections among the students.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Pin-lin Elementary School in northern Taiwan's Taipei County
announced that the whole school had been shut down for five days a day earlier,
making it the second school to do so on the orders of the county's education
bureau following the closure of the Pin-lin Junior High School.</P>
      <P>Twenty eight of the 223 students at the Pin-lin Elementary School had been
confirmed as having contracted H1N1.</P>
      <P>The increased spread of swine flu among students has led to mounting pressure on
parents, many of whom are having to take time off work to take care of their
children, while teachers are also facing greater pressure to conduct make-up
classes on holidays.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With China leading the global economic recovery, two-way trade across the Taiwan
Strait is regaining momentum steadily and Taiwan's export reliance on China has
risen correspondingly, government sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>In August, Taiwan's exports to China reached US$6.09 billion, an 11-month high
since the global financial crisis hit its peak last September, the Bureau of
Foreign Trade (BOFT) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs said in a press
statement.</P>
      <P>Despite a rebound in shipments to China month-on-month, August's export amount
still marked a 17.7 percent  decline  from the year-earlier level because of an
export boom that ran until August 2008, the statement said, adding that the
year-on-year export decrease for the month was the smallest in 11 months.</P>
      <P>China's fast economic recovery has led to an increase in Taiwan's exports to
China, the statement went on, adding that China accounted for 32 percent  of
Taiwan's  total  exports  in August,  the second-highest in cross-strait trade
history. The highest rate was registered in September 2007, when the ratio hit
32.5 percent.</P>
      <P>The BOFT statement further said that although Taiwan's overall exports to China
showed negative growth in August, some key export items posted gains. For
instance, IC chip sales marked a 15 percent increase compared with the previous
month.</P>
      <P>In August, Taiwan's trade surplus with China hit a 12-month high of US$3.93
billion, the statement added.</P>

      <P>The top European Union envoy to Taiwan said Thursday that the European
Commission is working hard with the Taiwanese authorities to establish visa-free
privileges for Taiwanese nationals entering the Schengen area, but added that
there is no timetable on the issue.</P>
      <P>Guy Ledoux, head of the Taipei-based European Economic and Trade Office, told
CNA that "we are working towards making a proposal before the end of the year,
but whether it can be done I'm not sure."</P>
      <P>He noted that the incumbent EU Commission's term will expire at the end of
October, with a new commission coming into office in January.</P>
      <P>"Before that, I don't know whether any new initiative will be made," Ledoux
said.</P>
      <P>Ledoux's remarks came in response to comments made by Charles Tannock, a member
of the European Parliament (MEP) and chairman of a pro-Taiwan group in the
European parliament, who said a day earlier in Taipei that he hopes Taiwanese
people will be able to enter EU nations without a visa by early 2010.</P>
      <P>Although Chiu Jong-jen, director-general of the department of European Affairs
under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) , said later that day that
Taiwanese nationals are expected to be granted visa-free privileges at some
point between April and June next year, MOFA spokesman Henry Chen pointed out
that in fact there is no timetable for the issue, saying only that things are
moving in a positive direction.</P>

      <P>A wide range of special offers will be offered at the Taipei International
Travel Fair (ITF) 2009 set to open at the Taipei World Trade Center Friday, as
local tourism operators attempt to reverse the downturn in the sector due to the
swine flu epidemic and the effects of Typhoon Morakot, an event organizer said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>This year, a record high of 1,206 booths will be set up by operators from 58
countries during the four-day fair, according to Stanley Chang-shou Yen.</P>
      <P>Of the total, 256 booths will be promoting the World Expo 2010 Shanghai, Yen
added.</P>
      <P>The fair offers a good opportunity for visitors to hunt for bargains and get
first-hand information and tips on travel in various countries, he added.</P>
      <P>In recent years, individual tours have become an increasingly popular form of
travel among young people worldwide, Yen noted, while encouraging those
interested in planning this form of tourism to visit the fair to gather
information for their travel plans.</P>
      <P>Between last July and this July, the number of Taiwanese tourists visiting China
reached about 4.75 million, more than half of a total of 8 million overseas
visits made last year by Taiwanese people, Taiwan Visitors Association Chairman
Chou Ching-hsiung said.</P>
      <P>Between last July, when restrictions on visits to Taiwan by people from China
were relaxed, and the end of September, Chinese people made more than 885,000
visits to Taiwan, making China Taiwan's second-biggest source of visitors,
second only to Japan, according to statistics.</P>
      <P>In addition, the number of Hong Kong tourists visiting Taiwan has reached
540,000 so far this year, up 15 percent year-on- year, according to Yen.</P>
      <P>Backpackers form the largest group of visitors to Taiwan, who are attracted by
the country's culture and natural scenery and the convenience of travel,
according to Yen, who added that Taiwan therefore should promote its tourism
attractions and expand its international tourist sources.</P>

      <P>Two professional baseball players of the Brother Elephants team admitted
Thursday to being involved in game-fixing.</P>
      <P>Wang Chin-li and Wu Pau-hsien made their confessions while being questioned by
prosecutors of the Banciao District Prosecutors Office in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>An investigation into professional baseball game-fixing had been snowballing
over the past few days since nine players were summoned and eight named as
defendants after questioning a day earlier. More players were summoned Thursday
evening.</P>
      <P>Wang and Wu were the only two detained for further questioning and were released
early Thursday after confessing their involvement.</P>
      <P>Among the eight defendants, six are members of the Brother Elephants, including
Wang, Wu, Tsao Chin-hui, Liu Yu-chan, Li Hao-jen and Wang Chun-tai. Hsieh Chia-
hsien of the Sinon Bulls and Chang Chih-chia of the La New Bears have also been
implicated.</P>
      <P>Brother Elephants manager Hung Jui-he suggested last year that the team would be
disbanded if any players were proven to have engaged in game-fixing. With six
players listed as defendants by prosecutors, the future of Brother Elephants is
of grave concern of baseball fans, as Hung reiterated his comments after his
players were summoned by prosecutors.</P>
      <P>Minister of Sports Affairs Dai Hsia-ling also expressed concern about Hung's
decision. Noting the team's contributions to Taiwan's professional baseball
development, Dai called on Hung not to disband the team.</P>
      <P>She pointed out that the Brother Elephants has been the country's most popular
team, the future of Taiwan's professional baseball is closely related to the

      <P>If Taiwan's newly signed protocol with the United States on opening its market
wider to U.S. beef from cattle younger than 30 months is an international
treaty, it should be approved by the Legislative Yuan before it takes effect, a
legislative official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Liu Han-ting, head of the Legislative Yuan's Organic Laws and Statutes Bureau,
made the remarks while fielding questions at a legislative committee session.</P>
      <P>During the session, ruling Kuomintang Legislator Lu Hsueh-chang said that as the
new Taiwan-U.S. beef trade protocol is closely related to the people's rights
and health, it should be screened by the legislature.</P>
      <P>According to a previous ruling by the Council of Grand Justices, Liu said,
written documents signed with a foreign country, regardless of its designation
or name, should be screened by the legislature if its provisions are related to
the people's rights or concern national interests and major affairs.</P>
      <P>Even if the new protocol is merely an administrative accord, it should still be
sent to the legislature, according to Liu.</P>
      <P>"But so far, we have not yet received any document or notice from the executive
branch," Liu added.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) announced Oct. 23 that Taiwan would
expand market access for U.S. beef after officials of the two countries clinched
an accord the previous day in Washington, D.C., to lift a partial ban on U.S.
beef imports.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the new accord, U.S. bone-in beef, ground beef, intestines,
brains, spinal cords and processed beef from cattle younger than 30 months that
have not been contaminated with "specific risk materials" will be allowed to
enter Taiwan starting Nov. 10.</P>
      <P>Specific risk materials are defined in the protocol as brains, skulls, eyes,
trigeminal ganglia, spinal cords, vertebral columns and dorsal root ganglia from
cattle 30 months of age and older, or tonsils and the distal ileum of the small
intestine from cattle of all ages.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan only allows imports of U.S. boneless beef from cattle younger
than 30 months that contain no specified risk materials.</P>
      <P>The new market-opening decision has since drawn flak from opposition parties,
consumer rights activists, lawmakers and even city and county officials.</P>
      <P>In the face of mounting criticism, Premier Wu Den-yih said Thursday that the
government will see to it that U.S. beef offal and ground beef does not appear

      <P>DOH Minister Yaung Chih-liang also said the same day that if U.S. beef offal and

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou instructed the education authorities Thursday to make
efforts to retain Taiwan's excellent students in domestic colleges and
universities.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while meeting a group of winners of the 2009 International
Olympiad competitions in physics and mathematics at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>He was referring to recent moves by the University of Hong Kong and the City
University of Hong Kong to recruit Taiwanese students by offering a series of
privileges including free tuition and dormitory accommodation, as well as
subsidized living costs.</P>
      <P>Saying that many other universities in France and the United States are
following suit, Ma told the Ministry of Education to address the issue to
prevent an exodus of Taiwan's best students.</P>
      <P>"We are not opposed to studying abroad, but we just cannot let most of our
excellent  youngsters  pursue studies  in foreign countries," said Ma.</P>
      <P>He added that despite budget constraints, the government still allocated NT$10
billion for 2010 to help domestic universities upgrade their academic levels in
a bid to push them into the ranks of the world's top universities.</P>
      <P>Although the investment is still far less than that made by the governments of
Japan, South Korea and Singapore, it is still enough to prevent Taiwan's
universities from lagging too far behind their foreign counterparts, according
to Ma.</P>

      <P>Officials from Taiwan's animal health inspection bureau said Thursday that the
bureau will post officials in the United States to check the quality of U.S.
beef and beef products that are to be delivered to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine under the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture came up with the decision after the
Legislative Yuan's Economics Committee passed a resolution earlier in the day
that the quarantine bureau and the Cabinet-level Department of Health should
post officials in the United States.</P>
      <P>Those  officials  should  carry  out  regular  checks  of slaughterhouses and
other meat product facilities whose beef and beef products will be sold to
Taiwan to ensure that their products are free from bacterial or viral
contamination.</P>
      <P>The bureau said in a press statement that one of its staff members already
stationed in the United States is in fact a veterinarian who is qualified to
check the quality of U.S. beef and related products before they are delivered to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If he finds that the meat processing plants do not meet the requirements set
forth in the trade protocol signed by the two countries, the veterinarian is
under instructions to report the case back to Taiwan, the statement added.</P>

      <P>A wide range of special offers will be offered at the Taipei International
Travel Fair (ITF) 2009 set to open at the Taipei World Trade Center Friday, as
local tourism operators attempt to reverse the downturn in the sector due to the
swine flu epidemic and the effects of Typhoon Morakot, an event organizer said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>This year, a record high of 1,206 booths will be set up by operators from 58
countries during the four-day fair, according to Stanley Chang-shou Yen.</P>
      <P>Of the total, 256 booths will be promoting the World Expo 2010 Shanghai, Yen
added.</P>
      <P>The fair offers a good opportunity for visitors to hunt for bargains and get
first-hand information and tips on travel in various countries, he added.</P>
      <P>In recent years, individual tours have become an increasingly popular form of
travel among young people worldwide, Yen noted, while encouraging those
interested in planning this form of tourism to visit the fair to gather
information for their travel plans.</P>
      <P>Between last July and this July, the number of Taiwanese tourists visiting China
reached about 4.75 million, more than half of a total of 8 million overseas
visits made last year by Taiwanese people, Taiwan Visitors Association Chairman
Chou Ching-hsiung said.</P>
      <P>Between last July, when restrictions on visits to Taiwan by people from China
were relaxed, and the end of September, Chinese people made more than 885,000
visits to Taiwan, making China Taiwan's second-biggest source of visitors,
second only to Japan, according to statistics.</P>
      <P>In addition, the number of Hong Kong tourists visiting Taiwan has reached
540,000 so far this year, up 15 percent year-on- year, according to Yen.</P>
      <P>Backpackers form the largest group of visitors to Taiwan, who are attracted by
the country's culture and natural scenery and the convenience of travel,
according to Yen, who added that Taiwan therefore should promote its tourism
attractions and expand its international tourist sources.</P>

      <P>Two professional baseball players of the Brother Elephants team admitted
Thursday to being involved in game-fixing.</P>
      <P>Wang Chin-li and Wu Pau-hsien made their confessions while being questioned by
prosecutors of the Banciao District Prosecutors Office in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>An investigation into professional baseball game-fixing had been snowballing
over the past few days since nine players were summoned and eight named as
defendants after questioning a day earlier. More players were summoned Thursday
evening.</P>
      <P>Wang and Wu were the only two detained for further questioning and were released
early Thursday after confessing their involvement.</P>
      <P>Among the eight defendants, six are members of the Brother Elephants, including
Wang, Wu, Tsao Chin-hui, Liu Yu-chan, Li Hao-jen and Wang Chun-tai. Hsieh Chia-
hsien of the Sinon Bulls and Chang Chih-chia of the La New Bears have also been
implicated.</P>
      <P>Brother Elephants manager Hung Jui-he suggested last year that the team would be
disbanded if any players were proven to have engaged in game-fixing. With six
players listed as defendants by prosecutors, the future of Brother Elephants is
of grave concern of baseball fans, as Hung reiterated his comments after his
players were summoned by prosecutors.</P>
      <P>Minister of Sports Affairs Dai Hsia-ling also expressed concern about Hung's
decision. Noting the team's contributions to Taiwan's professional baseball
development, Dai called on Hung not to disband the team.</P>
      <P>She pointed out that the Brother Elephants has been the country's most popular
team, the future of Taiwan's professional baseball is closely related to the
future of the Brother Elephants.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Wayne  Lee,  secretary-general  of the  Chinese Professional
Baseball League (CPBL) , said that any players detained would be banned from
playing and suspended from the payroll. The teams to which they belong will be
left to decide on whether to terminate their contracts, he added.</P>

      <P>If Taiwan's newly signed protocol with the United States on opening its market
wider to U.S. beef from cattle younger than 30 months is an international
treaty, it should be approved by the Legislative Yuan before it takes effect, a
legislative official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Liu Han-ting, head of the Legislative Yuan's Organic Laws and Statutes Bureau,
made the remarks while fielding questions at a legislative committee session.</P>
      <P>During the session, ruling Kuomintang Legislator Lu Hsueh-chang said that as the
new Taiwan-U.S. beef trade protocol is closely related to the people's rights
and health, it should be screened by the legislature.</P>
      <P>According to a previous ruling by the Council of Grand Justices, Liu said,
written documents signed with a foreign country, regardless of its designation
or name, should be screened by the legislature if its provisions are related to
the people's rights or concern national interests and major affairs.</P>
      <P>Even if the new protocol is merely an administrative accord, it should still be
sent to the legislature, according to Liu.</P>
      <P>"But so far, we have not yet received any document or notice from the executive
branch," Liu added.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) announced Oct. 23 that Taiwan would
expand market access for U.S. beef after officials of the two countries clinched
an accord the previous day in Washington, D.C., to lift a partial ban on U.S.
beef imports.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the new accord, U.S. bone-in beef, ground beef, intestines,
brains, spinal cords and processed beef from cattle younger than 30 months that
have not been contaminated with "specific risk materials" will be allowed to
enter Taiwan starting Nov. 10.</P>
      <P>Specific risk materials are defined in the protocol as brains, skulls, eyes,
trigeminal ganglia, spinal cords, vertebral columns and dorsal root ganglia from
cattle 30 months of age and older, or tonsils and the distal ileum of the small
intestine from cattle of all ages.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan only allows imports of U.S. boneless beef from cattle younger
than 30 months that contain no specified risk materials.</P>
      <P>The new market-opening decision has since drawn flak from opposition parties,
consumer rights activists, lawmakers and even city and county officials.</P>
      <P>In the face of mounting criticism, Premier Wu Den-yih said Thursday that the
government will see to it that U.S. beef offal and ground beef does not appear
on Taiwan's market, but he did not elaborate on technical details.</P>
      <P>DOH Minister Yaung Chih-liang also said the same day that if U.S. beef offal and
ground beef is shipped to Taiwan, his department will inspect each case to check
whether the products are contaminated with any bacteria or viruses and said any
products that fail the inspections will not be allowed to enter the local
market.</P>

      <P>A record 86 percent of businesses did not adjust their employees' wages in 2008
due to the economic downturn triggered by the global financial crisis, according
to the results of an annual survey released Thursday by the Directorate General
of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The results show that only 10.9 percent of businesses gave pay increases, the
lowest level recorded since the survey was launched 12 years ago.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 4.1 percent of businesses imposed pay cuts, the highest level since
2003.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese yacht builders take part in Fort Lauderdale boat show</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Leading Taiwanese yacht builders are taking part in the Fort Lauderdale
International Boat Show 2009, the world's largest exhibition of its kind, slated
for Oct. 29-Nov. 2 in the Florida city known as "the yachting capital of the
world."</P>
      <P>The local builders are taking the opportunity to probe whether the world's yacht
market is about to rebound from the global economic meltdown of the past year,
said Chien Hung-yi, sales manager of Johnson Yachts, one of the leading OEM
builders for foreign big-name yacht companies.</P>
      <P>Chien, who has been in the trade for 24 years, said that "2009 has been the
slowest year ever."</P>
      <P>The boat show -- celebrating its 50th anniversary this year -- will feature US$3
billion-worth of boats, yachts, super yachts, electronics, engines and boating
accessories from every major marine manufacturer and boat builder worldwide.</P>
      <P>John Lu, founder and CEO of Horizon Yachts -- the largest yacht builder in Asia
and sixth-largest in the world -- said orders of his group dropped by 70 percent
in 2009, making it the only year since 2006 to witness sliding business.</P>
      <P>Lu, however, said he feels that the group's business is just about to sail out
of the danger zone.</P>
      <P>According to tallies from the Industrial Development Bureau under the Ministry
of Economic Affairs, yacht building revenue in Taiwan amounted to NT$9.2 billion
(US$285 million) in 2007 and further expanded to US$10.8 billion in 2008, but
the figure totaled only some US$6 billion this year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's yacht industry is a 30-year veteran in the yacht building world, said
Lu, even though yachting is non-existent in the country as a result of
restrictive regulations.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan is the only country in the world in which yacht builders build
yachts on land, and the only yacht building country in the world in which
yachting has until recently not been permitted.</P>
      <P>It is not impossible for Taiwan to turn into a yachting country if the
government lifts a ban on the development of marinas and yachting, as well as
adding new statutes governing yachting, he said.</P>
      <P>"Once bans are lifted and regulations put in place, the domestic yacht building
business will boom," he predicted.</P>
      <P>Horizon Yachts, which has been in the business for over 20 years, is at present
building  several  136-meter  luxury yachts for international buyers.</P>
      <P>Although the sector's production value cannot be on par with that of the high-
technology industry, Lu said, it could be an influential force diplomatically,
as buyers of luxury yachts from abroad are mostly business or industrial leaders
in rich and influential countries.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin Kun-chi, general manager of a Horizon subsidiary, said China is
catching up with Taiwan in yacht building. "Despite a shabby, backwater start,
the Chinese builders are catching up fast and they are building marinas," he
added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 100 fishermen from central Taiwan's Changhua County held a sit-in protest
against the fourth stage of construction of the Central Taiwan Science Park
(CTSP) Friday, claiming that the construction will cause serious pollution of
some of Taiwan's most important aquaculture areas and fishing grounds.</P>
      <P>Demanding that the government dismiss the project, Changhua fishermen  and
aquaculturists  staged the protest  outside the Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) , which was holding a meeting of a panel of experts to
assess the project's environmental impact.</P>
      <P>Lin Lien-tsung, leader of an anti-pollution group from Changhua's Fangyuan
township, said the decision to choose Erlin as the location for the project is
totally wrong.</P>
      <P>"Erlin is far from water sources, so water intake and waste water processing
will be problematic, " said Lin, as he urged the government to change the
location.</P>
      <P>Referring to an Oct. 20 statement by Premier Wu Den-yih that waste water from
the park will be routed to an outflow three kilometers off the coast of Changhua
County, Lin said that even if it is piped offshore, it will still flow back with
the tides to coastal areas.</P>
      <P>Changhua Fishery Development Association President Lin Chi-min said the waste
water problem will have a serious  effect on aquaculturists and farmers in the
area.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the production value of Changhua's fishery is about NT$2
billion (US$61.6 million) a year, while the production value of the area's
commercial oyster beds reaches over NT$1 billion ayear.</P>
      <P>Lin said local residents might agree to support the CTSP project only if the EPA
can guarantee to keep monitoring the science park's pollution status and to
suspend its operations whenever necessary.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP filibusters legislative session over U.S. beef</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)  legislators filibustered Friday's
legislative session in protest of the government's decision to lift Taiwan's
partial import ban on U.S. beef and beef products.</P>
      <P>Members of the DPP legislative  caucus demanded  that the administration
renounce the protocol that Taiwan recently signed with the United States on
opening its market to U.S. beef offal and ground beef and re-open negotiations
between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The DPP lawmakers  forcibly  occupied  the rostrum on the legislative floor and
prevented bills on the day's agenda from being screened.</P>
      <P>If the filibuster continues throughout the day, as the DPP caucus has
threatened, confirmation of the Central Election Commission's chairman, vice
chairman and seven to nine members nominated by Premier Wu Den-yih will be
forcibly postponed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  DPP Chairwoman  Tsai Ing-wen  said Friday that re-starting the
U.S.-Taiwan beef talks is the only option for the Ma Ying-jeou administration
now that a majority of Taiwan's people do not accept the results of the protocol
on beef signed between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) announced Oct. 23 that Taiwan would
expand market access for U.S. beef after officials of the two countries clinched
a protocol on Oct. 22 in Washington, D.C., to lift a partial ban on such
imports.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the protocol, U.S. bone-in beef, ground beef, intestines,
brains, spinal cords and processed beef from cattle younger than 30 months that
have not been contaminated with "specific risk materials" will be allowed to
enter Taiwan starting Nov. 10.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that according to the latest public opinion poll conducted by the DPP,
nearly 80 percent of Taiwan's people agreed that Taiwan should re-open
negotiations with the U.S. and 70 percent of the respondents  said the results
of the latest round of U.S.-Taiwan talks were unacceptable to them.</P>
      <P>Judging from current situation, she said, President Ma Ying-jeou has no grounds
on which to persuade the public to accept the protocol.</P>
      <P>Also on Friday, DPP spokesman Tsai Chi-chang questioned the professionalism of
DOH Minister Yaung Chih-liang for a comment he made on the issue a day earlier.</P>
      <P>"If only one single case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or mad cow
disease occurs in Taiwan because of the opening to U.S. beef imports, imports
will be halted immediately," Yaung said.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that when Taiwan agreed in 2006 to open its doors to U.S. boneless
beef, it had attached the proviso that Taiwan would suspend U.S. beef imports if
a single case of BSE occurred in the United States.</P>
      <P>Noting that if a case of BSE occurs in Taiwan, Taiwan would be a mad cow disease
affected area, a scenario too scary to be faced by Taiwan's people, Tsai argued.</P>
      <P>"How, as the country's top health official, could Yaung set such low standards
on imported beef?" the spokesman asked.</P>
      <P>Taiwan relies heavily on imports for beef and beef products as less than 10
percent of domestic consumption is sourced locally.</P>

      <P>China's semi-official Cross-Strait Tourism Exchange Association (CTEA) is
expected to begin work in late November to open an office in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>CTEA Director Fang Guishan, who is in Taiwan for a cross-strait travel fair,
said Friday that he will remain until late November to begin work on the plans
to set up the office.</P>
      <P>CTEA and its Taiwan counterpart, the Taiwan Strait Tourism and Travel
Association (TSTTA) , have already held talks in Hong Kong at the executive
level and have exchanged  applications  for the reciprocal opening of tourism
offices, Fang said.</P>
      <P>The two organizations will need time to review and approve the applications,
after which CTEA will begin work on its Taiwan office, he added.</P>
      <P>Fang did not specify when the CTEA Taiwan office will be opened or where exactly
it will be located, but said it will initially have a staff of 10, most of whom
will be from China's tourism sector.</P>
      <P>The staff will be expanded based on the scale of business at the office, he
added.</P>
      <P>CTEA and TSTTA will be the first semi-official organizations on both sides to

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou on Friday became Taiwan's first head of state to appear
at the opening of the Taipei International Travel Fair (ITF) in the show's
23-year history, voicing optimism over the prospects of the country's  tourism
industry.</P>
      <P>Ma said that despite the swine flu outbreak, Typhoon Morakot, and the economic
slump, total international visitor arrivals in the first nine months of 2009
were up 11 percent and international tourist arrivals were up 28 percent from
the same period a year earlier.</P>
      <P>The president attributed the growth to the relaxation  of restrictions on visits
to Taiwan by Chinese nationals in July 2008, citing the 885,000 visits made by
Chinese citizens to Taiwan between July 2008 and the end of September this year.</P>
      <P>The number of tourists from Hong Kong and Macau visiting Taiwan has also
increased significantly, he added.</P>
      <P>Ma also addressed issues related to Taiwanese nationals traveling abroad, saying
the government is working to put an end to visa restrictions imposed by other
countries on local travelers.</P>
      <P>Because the number of Taiwanese arrivals in Ireland and Britain have risen after
the two countries began granting visa-free treatment to them earlier in the
year, the European Union (EU) is expected to grant visa-free entry to Taiwanese
visitors next year, Ma believed.</P>
      <P>The president said that aside from offering visa-exemption privileges to
Taiwanese passport holders, Japan has engaged in negotiations with Taiwan on
setting up four round-trip flights daily between Tokyo's Haneda Airport and
Taipei's Songshan Airport in October 2010.</P>
      <P>The two airports are located much closer to the two cities' centers than the
international airports -- Narita Airport and Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport -- that usually serve them, and the flights could cut door-to-door
travel times by at least four hours.</P>
      <P>Tourism is one of the six major emerging industries  the government has slated
for priority development, and Ma estimated that with the joint efforts of the
government and the tourism sector, more than 4.1 million people will visit
Taiwan this year.</P>
      <P>This year, the Taipei ITF, one of the biggest annual travel industry events in
the Asia-Pacific region, is being held at the Taipei World Trade Center with 58
countries manning a total of 1,206 booths.</P>

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Friday:</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Beware of China's attempts to manipulate Taiwan's media</P>
      <P>The chief of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation is visiting China at the head
of a delegation of Taiwanese media executives with the hope of promoting press
exchanges with China.</P>
      <P>China does not have press freedom, and Taiwan's press freedom will be downgraded
from 36th spot to 59th worldwide next year, according to a rating conducted by
Reporters Sans Frontieres.</P>
      <P>So what is the purpose of Taiwanese journalists visiting China? To prepare them
for the country's further downgrading in ranks of press freedom?</P>
      <P>Taiwan has allowed Chinese reporters to be stationed in Taiwan to cover stories
about the country, only to find them skewing their stories about Taiwan to serve
China's political purposes.</P>
      <P>China's leaders have claimed that they will step up penetration of Taiwan's mass
media to sell China's political schemes. Their trick is beginning to work, as
some local TV channels broadcast live Beijing's Oct. 1 National Day military
parade.</P>
      <P>No government ought to be without censors, and a free press is obliged to
monitor the government. It is pointless to promote press exchanges with Beijing
before the press in China becomes an independent fourth estate.</P>
      <P>We have to caution our Taiwan press colleagues to guard against China's plot to
use them and not allow themselves to be debased as China's mouthpiece.</P>
      <P>Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>Ex-president's mess-up, people's disaster</P>
      <P>Ma Yung-cheng, the former deputy chief aide to ex-President Chen Shui-bian, said
in an interview with a local biweeky that Chen was wrong to transfer huge
amounts of funds overseas and transferring them among various bank accounts, and
also wrong in failing to address the problem after learning that his wife had
stashed huge funds overseas without his knowledge.</P>
      <P>Ma said he could not believe by any stretch of the imagination that Chen and his
family members had accumulated such a big fortune, and said Chen should separate
himself from his family members to make them realize what a big mistake they
made.</P>
      <P>Ma expressed regret that the Democratic Progressive Party's entire legacy after
eight years in power is a "mess-up."</P>
      <P>We have to regret that the people have been left to clean up Chen's mess.
However, Chen lacks the stuff of a head of state, but it was the people of
Taiwan who swept him to the peak of power nonetheless and so they well deserve
to carry the can.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>'Pseudo' DPP and KMT members</P>
      <P>A group of DPP followers branded DPP Chiayi County Magistrate Chen Ming-wen and
DPP Chiayi County magistrate candidate Chang Hwa-kuan as pseudo DPP members
because they formerly belonged to the Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the DPP has voiced its support for Chang Chih-min in his bid for
Hualien County magistrate, because Chang, who was groomed by incumbent KMT
magistrate Hsieh Shen-shan as his successor, is running against Du Li-hua, the
KMT's official candidate in Hualien.</P>
      <P>We wouldn't be surprised if Hsieh, who was elected four years ago on the KMT
ticket, cooperates with the DPP to help Chang Chih-min.</P>
      <P>Furthermore,  Hsinchu County Magistrate Cheng Yung-chin was expelled by the KMT
for supporting in public a former member of the KMT who is running for the
office in defiance of the party.</P>
      <P>There are many individuals in Taiwan who are political turncoats. They change
their party affiliation not out of political beliefs but for personal interests.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Time for government to reorganize professional baseball league</P>
      <P>The image of Taiwan's professional baseball league has again been tarnished by a
game-fixing scandal, for the fifth time in its 20-year history.</P>
      <P>With only four teams in the league, it is on the brink of collapse as eight
players of one leading team are reportedly involved in the scandal.</P>
      <P>We urge the government to weigh in on reorganizing the league rather than
letting it go down the drain after it is deserted by its fans, as it will deal a
hard blow to the people's confidence and make them more cynical.</P>
      <P>The government's involvement should come in the form of bringing the offenders
to justice, encouraging large enterprises to sponsor professional baseball
teams, and charge the president of the league with managing it.</P>
      <P>The administration should consider the reorganization of the baseball league as
part of its reform program for the whole country and make it one of the plan's
most eye-catching elements.</P>

    <HEADLINE>2010 Taipei Intl Flora Expo to make Taipei proud: mayor</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/30/09  18:28:56</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Following the success of the Deaflympics in September, during which Taiwan
showcased the theme "Power in Me" to the city's residents and people around the
world, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin now envisions bringingPower of Beautyto Taipei
with the 2010 Taipei International Gardening and Horticulture Exposition (Taipei
Intl Flora Expo).</P>
      <P>Entering its final one-year countdown, Hau vowed that the expo, which will give
Taipei City a face-lift by upgrading its software and hardware facilities, will
once again take the capital to the international limelight and make its citizens
proud.</P>
      <P>Scheduled to be held for the first time in Taiwan from Nov. 6, 2010 to April 25,
2011, the Taipei Intl Flora Expo is the first category A2B1 world exposition for
Taiwan to host under the authorization of the Netherlands-based International
Association of Horticultural Producers (AIPH). Taipei is the seventh city in
Asia to host international players in the horticulture industry.</P>
      <P>2010 Flora Expo: Taipeis new interaction with the world</P>
      <P>Managing to squeeze time out of his busy schedule, Hau paid an inspection tour
to major exhibitions halls of the expo Thursday. Hau stood in front of the EXPO
Hall and mapped out his vision, saying that the main objective of the expo is
tolet the world see Taipei, and let Taipei embrace the world.</P>
      <P>Noting that the test operation of the expo will kick off in September 2010, Hau
estimated that the 171-day event will attract over 6 million visitors from home
and abroad, and with a total investment of NT$3.529 billion, the expo will
create a minimum economic benefit of NT$11.7 billion (US$360 million) -- roughly
1.5 to 3 times the investment amount based on statistics of previous events held
worldwide.</P>
      <P>Business or industries such as horticulture, tourism and travel, restaurants and
bio-technology are also expected to benefit, which Hau said would be a great
boost in revitalizing Taiwans economy.</P>
      <P>Hau noted that Taiwan has always enjoyed a great reputation for and  taken
pride  in  its  advancement  in horticulture  and bio-technology,  with  world-
acclaimed  orchid  productions  and celebrated rice and fruit growing
technologies.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Taipei is a modern city rich in cultural and natural resources, Hau
said, citing as examples the city's annual output value of US$50 billion in the
high-tech industry; the more than 640,000 pieces of historic and cultural
treasures housed in the National Palace Museum, as well as hot spring sites and
volcanic geography in Yangmingshan National Park.</P>
      <P>All of these features will be showcased in the expo not only to increase Taipeis
international profile but also to promote global understanding of Taiwan,Hau
said.</P>
      <P>Support of Taipei citizens key to the success</P>
      <P>Hau admitted that there were obstacles and frustrations over the past two years
in preparing for the expo because unlike previous flora expos held in Europe,
Japan or China, the 2010 Taipei expo will be the first of its kind to be held in
a city center.</P>
      <P>High population density, frequent industrial and commercial activities,  and
great transportation volume made it extremely difficult to find permanent sites
for constructing the pavilions, Hau said.</P>
      <P>Minimizing the impacts on traffic and how to move the temporary pavilions for
future use, all posed great challenges to the city government, according Hau,
adding that therefore,reduce, reuse and recycleare the key concepts when
designing the pavilions.</P>
      <P>I, however, have good faith in our citizens. While the city government is doing
all it can to accomplish the arduous task, I believe that everybody will offer
his or her greatest support to help us market Taipei and create a first-class
international image, Hau said.</P>
      <P>When 2010 Taipei Intl Expo meets ROC Centennial anniversary</P>
      <P>With world-class exhibition scale, content and participants, Hau said the Taipei
flora expo will be of special meaning given the fact that the Republic of China
will also be celebrating its centennial birthday in 2011, as many other
countries did when they hosted the event, such as Italy, Canada and Australia.</P>
      <P>Featuring a theme ofFlower, River, New Horizon, the Taipei Expo will include 14
unique exhibition pavilions, eight of which are remodeled  from  existing
buildings  while  the rest are new constructions, to bring about the
characteristics offlora and horticulture, culture and arts, environmental
ecologyand pioneering technology.</P>
      <P>Hau said there is no better stage than the 2010 Taipei expo for Taiwan to
showcase its strength in horticulture and flora industry, as the event is the
most prestigious professional horticultural exposition in the world.</P>
      <P>Five pavilions are dedicated for this purpose, including the EXPO Dome and
Pavilion of Culture located in the Yuanshan Park Area, and Pavilion of Future,
Pavilion of Life and Palace of Floral Teas located in Xinsheng Park Area, he
added.</P>
      <P>Environmental ecology also plays a significant part in the expo, Hau said, not
only because environmental protection is a common responsibility of human
beings, but also because of the fact that global warming has become an
international hot issue.</P>
      <P>Concepts of ecological conservation and resources recycling were embodied in the
design of the EXPO Theater, a three-dimensional theater which will be showing a
film titledFace the Reality of the Earthto increase awareness of ecological
crisis in Taiwan, he added.</P>
      <P>In addition, five pavilions are designed to demonstrate Taiwans diversified
cultures and arts, including Celebritys House, Pavilion of New Fashion Pavilion
of Aroma of Flowers and the EXPO Hall, while Pavilion of Future, Pavilion of
Dreams and Pavilion of Life will showcase Taiwans excellent pioneering
technologies.</P>
      <P>Taipei Expo expected to create immense business opportunities</P>
      <P>The calculations of Taipei city governments Department of Economic Development
show that the 2010 Taipei flora expo is expected to attract six million
visitors, including 300,000 from abroad. It is also expected to generate NT$11.7
billion in economic benefits and create 63,000 jobs.</P>
      <P>Promising to purchase the planned use of more than 40 million flowers and plants
for the exposition from local floriculture industry and producers, Hau said the
event also provides a great opportunity to display Taiwans native flower and
plant species on the international stage and show to the world Taiwans vitality.</P>
      <P>According to Hau, the flora expo will not only bring economic benefits to the
floriculture producers, but will also help promote growth in industries such as
green architecture, landscaping, and exhibition and convention.</P>
      <P>Public participation and international propaganda</P>
      <P>Entering the final year of preparation, how to increase the publics
participation and enthusiasm for the event and how to promote international
propaganda are two major challenges of the Taipei city government, according to
Hau.</P>
      <P>In response to the challenges, his team will establish morecity gardensand
install large green sculptures at major railway stations to trumpet up public
interests in the event, Hau said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the mayor said the city government will model its successful
experience  in holding the Deaflympics  to recruit volunteers from the private
sectors, such as schools, companies and non-governmental organizations, so as to
show foreign visitors the warmth of Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>As to international propaganda, Hau specifically mentioned the series of reports
by CNA, which come in Chinese, English and Spanish, as part of the city
governments efforts to increase international awareness of the expo.</P>
      <P>He added that the government is also working on boosting the profile  of the
2010 expo  by participating  in international activities, holding marketing
events, visiting AIPH member cities to exchanges experiences and seeking
assistance from Taiwans foreign representative and trade offices.</P>
      <P>It is no doubt that the Taipei city government has long been thinking out of the
box of holding anexpo, but rather it attaches a deeper meaning to the entire
project by motivating citizens of Taipei to participate in the event to increase
their appreciation for a green environment.</P>
      <P>Under the leadership of Mayor Hau, the Taipei city government has made
tremendous efforts in building Taipei as acity gardenthrough encouraging  the
private sectors and civil groups to beautify buildings and public spaces with
renovations or art displays. It is through such an endeavor that the green
concept of the 2010 Taipei International Flora Expo has been expanding to the
entire city.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu, whose popularity rose after the city successfully
staged the 2009 World Games, has emerged  as one of the favored  campaigners
among Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) hopefuls ahead of the year-end city and
county chief elections.</P>
      <P>Chen has been invited to campaign for DPP county magistrate candidates Chang
Hwa-kuan in Chiayi, Cheng Wen-tsang in Taoyuan, and Tsao Chi-hung in Pingtung
and for mayoral candidate Twu Shiing-jer in Chiayi City.</P>
      <P>She will also be visiting Yilan County for a weekend election rally for
magistrate candidate Lin Tsong-shyan.</P>
      <P>DPP candidates in the past have tended to seek public support from heavyweights
like former President Chen Shui-bian, former Vice President Annette Lu, and
former premiers Frank Hsieh and Su Tseng-chang, but Chen has emerged from their
shadows to become a popular campaign draw.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung mayor said she hopes she can offer warm support for party comrades
during this low period for the DPP and regain voters' confidence in the party.</P>
      <P>A survey of Kaohsiung City residents published by the city's Research,
Development and Evaluation Commission (RDEC) on Sep. 24 found that 82 percent of
those surveyed said they felt proud to be a resident of the southern Taiwan
city, and Mayor Chen had a 78 percent approval rating.</P>
      <P>RDEC attributed Chen's rising approval rate, which was 10 percent higher than
the poll conducted a year ago, to the World Games held in July.</P>
      <P>The year-end "three-in-one" elections for mayors and magistrates, city and
county councilors, and city and township heads will be held Dec. 5.</P>
      <P>As six cities and counties -- Taipei County, Taitung City and County, Tainan
City and County, Kaohsiung County -- will be upgraded or merged into
municipalities that will not elect new chiefs until late in 2010, this year's
elections will be held in only 17 cities and counties.</P>

      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) joined local cattle farmers and traders Friday
in promoting Taiwanese beef in anticipation of competition from U.S. beef, after
Taiwan's government lifted a ban this month on previously-banned U.S. beef
products.</P>
      <P>COA Minister Chen Wu-hsiung stressed that local beef is safer and fresher than
imports, and he urged consumers to buy local products when shopping for the
meat.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is expected to open its market wider to U.S. beef starting Nov. 10,
allowing in items such as bone-in beef, ground beef, intestines and processed
beef that were previously banned out of concerns over bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) , or mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>The local beef sector fears that the imports, which cost less than their
domestically-produced counterparts, may hurt the market for Taiwanese beef.</P>
      <P>Hsu Chien-hung,  president  of the Taiwan Beef Development Association, called
consumers' attention to the fact that Taiwanese cattle is free of BSE infection
and that their meat is "definitely safe" to eat.</P>
      <P>According to Lo Chiu-ying, an associate professor at National Taiwan
University's Department of Animal Science and Technology, although the
government has to liberalize Taiwan's market to U.S. beef for various reasons,
consumers must learn to select products that are relatively safe.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several local and foreign manufacturers of plastic shoes sold in Taiwan were
ordered Friday to recall and destroy their products because of a health risk
from excessive levels of plasticizers.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Standards, Meteorology and Inspection under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs issued the order, saying that 30 percent of the plastic shoes
on the domestic market were found to contain excessive amounts of various toxic
chemicals.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau, 10 of the 30 items that it tested in a random  sampling
August  to September  were found to contain plasticizers in excess of the 0.1
percent permitted level.</P>
      <P>The standards  bureau demanded  that manufacturers  of the substandard shoes
immediately remove their products from store shelves and destroy them.</P>
      <P>It also urged parents to be on guard against young children putting plastic
shoes in their mouths.</P>
      <P>Nine of the shoe samples tested by the standards bureau contained DEHP, while
another one contained DBP -- two substances defined as phthalates, which are
widely used as additives in a range of plastics and other materials.</P>
      <P>DBP and DEHP have been classified as environmental hormones by the World Health
Organization  and as toxic chemicals by the Cabinet-level Environmental
Protection Administration (EPA).</P>
      <P>Exposure to excessive levels of the chemicals can affect the health of both
adults and children, according to the EPA.</P>
      <P>The bureau's order came in the wake of a warning issued by the Consumers'
Foundation, which found in an inspection in July and August that as many as 40
percent of the plastic shoes sold on the domestic market contained excessive
amounts of plasticizer.</P>
      <P>The foundation released the results of its findings earlier this month and asked
the government to take swift action to protect the public's health.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DRAM maker Powerchip reports improved earnings picture in Q3</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 30 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Powerchip Semiconductor, Taiwan's largest DRAM maker prior to the economic
downturn, reported Friday a large drop in net losses in the third quarter, while
rival ProMOS posted bigger losses as revenues remained weak.</P>
      <P>Powerchip's results were more representative of the industry as a whole, as DRAM
prices recover from December 2008 lows and demand for chips, mostly for
computers, picks up.</P>
      <P>The company reported a net loss of NT$4.766 billion in Q3, down 63.3 percent
from the second quarter. Though it posted a bigger loss than rivals Nanya
Technology and Inotera Memories, its loss per share of NT$0.53 was the lowest
among local DRAM vendors.</P>
      <P>Powerchip's revenues rose 60.4 percent quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter
to NT$7.428 billion, exceeding losses in a quarter for the first time this year.</P>
      <P>The company expected that Q4 results would improve further and could even see a
profit if DRAM prices hold their current levels.</P>
      <P>In an earnings call earlier this month, Nanya's reported that its Q3 net loss
had fallen 41 percent from the second quarter to NT$3.888 billion, or NT$1.51
per share.</P>
      <P>Inotera reported on Oct. 21 that its net loss fell 39 percent to NT$2.524
billion, or NT$0.73 per share, on revenues of NT$9.54 billion.  The  company
said  its  revenues  rose  28 percent quarter-on-quarter on higher average
selling prices and lower idle capacity costs.</P>
      <P>Improving prices and market conditions have given a slight reprieve to Taiwan's
debt-ridden DRAM industry, which overinvested in capacity when global demand was
still strong and has had trouble filling it.</P>
      <P>The fragmented nature of the local DRAM sector has also made it harder  for
companies  to develop  or invest  in competitive technologies, putting them at a
disadvantage compared to larger Korean  competitors  and  leading  to
speculation  of  market consolidation.</P>
      <P>Though the industry shows signs of recovery, ProMOS has benefited less than its
rivals as its sales continued to be dwarfed by losses.</P>
      <P>The company on Friday reported a net loss of NT$6.82 billion in Q3, or NT$1.16
per share, nearly three times as high as the company's NT$1.73 billion net loss
reported in Q2, though lower than the NT$9.4 billion net loss in Q1.</P>
      <P>ProMOS had a net loss of NT$17.96 billion in the first nine months of 2009, far
exceeding net sales of NT$6.7 billion, and the gap only narrowed marginally in
Q3.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government tried to launch Taiwan Memory Company (now called Taiwan
Innovation Memory) earlier this year to restructure the industry. It was to
consolidate Powerchip, ProMOS, and Rexchip Electronics  and incorporate
technology from Japan-based Elpida Memory.</P>
      <P>But that venture's fate remains uncertain, as some question its need with the
market picking up again.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The decisions made by leaders at this year's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) summit following their expected discussions of the global economic crisis
and the influenza A(H1N1)  threat will impact on the economic situation in the
Asia-Pacific region, experts said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to Chiang Chi-cheng, deputy director of the Chinese Taipei APEC Study
Center (CTASC) , the APEC summit this year has greater significance because of
the many problems, including the global economic downturn, the spread of
influenza A (H1N1), climate change and energy issues, that have been evident in
2009.</P>
      <P>These problems brought a lot of uncertainties to the region, and the leaders at
the APEC summit would have to come up with some responses, Chiang said at a
seminar.</P>
      <P>To avoid being marginalized, Chiang suggested, Taiwan should channel more
attention and resources to adapting to the structural changes in the region.</P>
      <P>Chiang also noted that the summit in Singapore will focus on economic and trade
issues, particularly how to ensure economic growth that is both environmentally
friendly and considerate of the society.</P>
      <P>He added that one of the highlights of the 2009 APEC summit Nov. 12-14 will be
U.S. President Barack Obama's participation for the first time.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang Honorary Chairman and former Vice President Lien Chan is expected to
represent Taiwan at the summit as President Ma Ying-jeou's special envoy.
Foreign Minister Timothy Yang said last week that the Taiwan envoy has been
selected and an official announcement will be made soon.</P>

      <P>The government has not eased restrictions on U.S. beef imports as a quid pro quo
for visa-free treatment for Taiwan's citizens from the United States, Foreign
Affairs Minister Timothy C. T. Yang said Friday.</P>
      <P>Yang said the recent decision to open U.S. bone-in beef, ground beef and offal
and the pursuit of visa-free treatment are "two totally unrelated issues."</P>
      <P>Talks on easing U.S. imported beef had been in progress for two years, starting
even before President Ma Ying-jeou's inauguration on May 20, 2008, he said.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Taipei and Washington are conducting talks on many issues,
including U.S. granting visa-free treatment to Taiwanese nationals and the
resumption of the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA), Yang added.</P>
      <P>The TIFA talks have become the most important channel of Taiwan-U.S.
communication on trade and economic issues since the severance of diplomatic
ties between the two countries in 1979. The event is hosted by Taiwan and the
United States every year on a rotational basis.</P>
      <P>The dialogue has been suspended since 2007, however, because of differences
between the two sides on various issues, including U.S. beef exports.</P>
      <P>"There are many common issues related to Taiwan-U.S. relations and interests, "
and U.S. beef imports should not be linked to them, Yang said.</P>
      <P>He also tried to calm fears that imported offal or ground beef from the U.S
would trigger bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, in Taiwan,
saying the government adopted a "cautious and responsible approach" during the
talks and that the criteria under which U.S. beef will enter the country is
stricter than in other countries.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's most popular professional baseball team will decide next week whether
to disband after 12 of its players have been implicated in game-fixing  during
the just-concluded baseball season, a government official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Concerned about the future of the Brother Elephants in the wake of the game-
fixing scandal, Sports Affairs Council Minister Tai Hsia-ling met with the
team's general manager, Hung Rei-ho, earlier Monday.</P>
      <P>"Despite the scandal, I remain confident in the strength of the Brother
Elephants, and I encouraged Hung to continue operating the team," Tai said of
her meeting with Hung.</P>
      <P>Noting that the team has been in operations for 25 years and has the largest
number of fans of any of the professional league's four franchises, Tai said her
council does not want to see the Elephants disband.</P>
      <P>"I told Hung that many players are disciplined and focused and should not be
forced to leave their beloved profession and beloved team simply because of some
players'  alleged involvement  in game-fixing," Tai said.</P>
      <P>According to the minister, Hung will decide on the Elephants' fate after he
meets with Chao Shou-po, president of Taiwan's Chinese Professional Baseball
League (CPBL), next week when Chao returns home from an overseas visit.</P>
      <P>Tai said the government will convene an interministerial meeting next Tuesday to
discuss issues regarding professional baseball development.</P>
      <P>"At the upcoming meeting, I will convey Hung's request that law enforcement
authorities adopt preventive strategies to help resolve the gambling and game-
fixing issues that have often cast a pall on our professional baseball
development, " Tai said.</P>
      <P>She added that criminal investigators and prosecutors should address the issues
from a preventive perspective to avoid impeding the development of the pro game
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If the Elephants' management eventually decides to disband the team, Tai said
her council will help seek other corporations to sponsor a team in the league.</P>
      <P>"Anyway, we will make every possible effort to keep the CPBL afloat," Tai said.</P>
      <P>Hung vowed last year during a similar game-fixing scandal to disband his team if
any of his players were involved in gambling and game fixing, but he now seems
to be having second thoughts.</P>
      <P>He was quoted by a local newspaper as saying that despite his debilitating pain
over his players' betrayal of his trust, he could not ignore his team's social
responsibility.</P>
      <P>"I felt heartbroken... Our reputation and image which we have been working so
hard to cultivate over a quarter of century were destroyed overnight... I could
not but feel despondent," Hung said.</P>
      <P>The alleged involvement of Elephants players, including Tsao Chin-hui -- the
first Taiwanese pitcher to ever compete in the U.S. Major Leagues -- dealt yet
another harsh blow to the CPBL's already tarnished image.</P>
      <P>Since 1996, five major game-fixing scandals have been reported, but it marked
the first time that Elephants players were involved.</P>
      <P>Hung said that if the government does not take active steps to resolve the
baseball-related gambling issue once and for all, it would be meaningless for
his team to continue operations, as new scandals are likely to occur every one
or two years.</P>
      <P>Hung said earlier in the day his team has decided not to extend its contracts
with Tsao and the team's Japanese manager Nakakomi Shin.</P>
      <P>It will also discontinue its contracts with four players -- pitchers Wang Chin-
li, Wu Bau-hsien, and Li Hao-jen and infielder Ju Hung-suen -- all of whom have
confessed to prosecutors their involvement in game-fixing.</P>
      <P>In an effort to alleviate concerns that the latest scandal could become the last
straw for the demise of Taiwan's professional baseball, Vice Premier Eric Liluan
Chu said Friday the government will not stand idly by as the CPBL collapses.</P>
      <P>Chu stressed  that the investigation  into the game-fixing allegations are not
aimed at wiping out professional baseball but rather at promoting its
development in the right direction, and he pledged that the government will
cooperate with teams and the league to resurrect the sport after the
investigation is concluded.</P>
      <P>"Baseball will not come to its demise in Taiwan. We should have confidence. The
government will endeavor to create a clean and secure environment for baseball
players and baseball fans, " Chu pledged.</P>

      <P>The government's immunization program for influenza A (H1N1) , or swine flu,
will kick off Nov. 1 across the country, and the public will be entitled to take
shots at designated spots based on a priority list, the Central Epidemics
Command Center (CECC) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Steve Kuo, director of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the Cabinet-
level Department of Health (DOH) , said HIN1 vaccinations will be given in
several stages to individuals in 12 vulnerable groups based on a DOH-set
priority list to avoid possible chaos.</P>
      <P>Some 6,000 people displaced by Typhoon Morakot in early August, who are being
housed at 22 shelters,  and medical  personnel responsible for disease control
and prevention, will be the first in line to be immunized, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>They will be followed by pregnant women, pre-school children above one year of
age and seriously ill patients, in that order.</P>
      <P>Some 3.6 million elementary, junior and senior high school students will be the
next group to be vaccinated, beginning Nov. 12.</P>
      <P>To complete the immunization program, which is expected to extend until the
Chinese New Year holiday early next year, the DOH has purchased a total of 15
million H1N1 doses of the vaccine from local and foreign companies -- a level
sufficient to cover the anticipated local demand of 12 million doses.</P>
      <P>According to the DOH plan, 5 million doses of H1N1 vaccine manufactured by
Swiss-based pharmaceutical firm Novartis will be first used for high-risk
individuals, while 10 million doses to be supplied by local manufacturer
Adimmune Corp. will be in place in early November.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-chung, public health bureau chief of southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung
County, said 2,100 Morakot typhoon refugees housed at four shelters will be
vaccinated from Nov. 1.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung County, the area hardest hit by the storm, has initially been
allocated more than 30,000 doses of H1N1 vaccine by the central government,
Huang noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the offshore Kinmen County will begin immunizing medical personnel on
Nov. 2. It will get 40,500 doses of HIN1 vaccines from the central government,
compared to some 60,000 people who permanently reside there.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Education (MOE) warned that the H1N1 virus is
expected to reach its peak in November, and urged schools nationwide to suspend
large-scale activities during that month and to swiftly cancel classes in line
with a set of MOE guidelines as necessary.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several local civic groups have recently launched a campaign to seek public
endorsement of a planned "NGO consensus memorandum" on a proposed cross-Taiwan
Strait peace agreement, drawing considerable online interest.</P>
      <P>Ho Tsung-hsun, the executive director of the Taipei-based Citizen Congress Watch
and one of the initiators of the campaign, said Friday there have been many
online responses to the idea since the Taiwan Grassroots Alliance for Peace
(TGAP) organized the first preparatory meeting for the planned memorandum in
Taipei Oct. 26.</P>
      <P>"Most people online supported the idea, with some even proposing their own
versions of articles" in the alliance's cross-strait peace agreement, Ho said.</P>
      <P>Eight  representatives  of the  participating  nongovernment organizations,
which support a range of causes including women's rights, environmental
protection, human rights, peace and education, joined the meeting to discuss the
content of the memorandum.</P>
      <P>Ho said the memorandum will be Taiwan's grassroots voice on the widely discussed
peace accord between Taiwan and China, and that its existence is to safeguard
the fundamental civil rights of Taiwan's people in the political, economic,
social and cultural spheres.</P>
      <P>The TGAP anticipates that the governing Kuomintang (KMT) will put forth in 2011
the idea of signing a peace agreement that was first proposed in the historic
talks in 2005 between then KMT Chairman Lien Chan and Communist Party of China
(CPC) General Secretary Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>The alliance explained that it believes President Ma Ying-jeou is more likely to
meet Hu before his first term ends in 2012 since Ma took office as KMT chairman
on Oct. 17.</P>
      <P>While it is expected the two sides will reach agreement to sign a cross-strait
memorandum of understanding on cooperation in financial supervision, and an
economic cooperation framework agreement by mid-2010, the alliance contended
that Ma and Hu will promote the peace agreement during their anticipated meeting
in 2011.</P>
      <P>It is questionable, however, whether the cross-strait peace agreement proposed
by the two political parties will be in the best interests of the two sides, or
whether the KMT and CPC will take into account opinions of civic organizations
and different ethnic groups in structuring the deal.</P>
      <P>Based on those concerns, Taiwanese NGOs have decided to outline their version of
a blueprint for the peaceful development of cross-strait ties, the TGAP said.</P>
      <P>According to the alliance, the NGOs have planned to complete and publicize its
memorandum before President Ma celebrates his second anniversary in office on
May 20, 2010.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan on Friday promised to submit the new Taiwan-U.S. beef trade
protocol to the Legislative Yuan for reference in a month, ruling Kuomintang
(KMT) Legislator Lu Hsueh-chang has confirmed.</P>
      <P>Cabinet Secretary-General Lin Jhong-shen made the promise after reaching a
consensus with the KMT legislative caucus, Lu said.</P>
      <P>The legislator also expected that the Department of Health (DOH) should brief
relevant legislative committees on the issue, because "in compliance with a 2006
legislative resolution, the DOH is required to provide detailed reports about
the importation of U.S. beef to the legislature."</P>
      <P>The KMT legislative caucus would not rule out the possibility of sending the
document for committee review, Lu said.</P>
      <P>The new protocol is an administrative accord that would normally take effect
after being approved by the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Under the Exercise of Powers by Legislative Yuan Law, any administrative order
enacted by government agencies is then delivered to the legislature and put up
for discussion in a legislative committee meeting.</P>
      <P>If more than 15 legislators attending the meeting agree, the administrative
order will then be handed to related legislative committees for review, Lu said.</P>
      <P>That is not likely in the KMT-controlled legislature, but Lu would not rule out
the possibility. He added that if the protocol were sent to related committees,
its screening should be completed within three months.</P>
      <P>If the deadline expires, the protocol will be considered approved by default, Lu
said.</P>
      <P>After the Department of Health announced Oct. 23 the relaxation of import
restrictions on U.S. beef products, effective from as early as Nov. 2, the KMT
legislative caucus has asked the Cabinet to devise measures on quarantine
inspection of U.S. beef imports before that date.</P>
      <P>Under the announcement, U.S. bone-in beef, ground beef and affal that have not
been contaminated with "specific risk materials" will be allowed to enter
Taiwan, while other cattle parts, such as brains, skulls, eyes, spinal nerve
roots from cattle over 30 months of age will remain on the banned list.</P>
      <P>The new market-opening decision has since drawn flak from opposition parties,
consumer rights activists, lawmakers and even city and county officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Prosecutors to sponsor baseball teams to deter game-fixing</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan's prosecutors offices will be encouraged to "adopt" various local
professional baseball teams to help deter gambling and game-fixing, a Ministry
of Justice (MOJ) official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Jui-chung, director of the MOJ's Department of Prosecutorial Affairs, said
that the Tainan Prosecutors Office in southern Taiwan has forged a close
cooperative relationship with the Uni-President Lions since 2007 to help with
the Tainan City-based professional baseball team's management.</P>
      <P>During his tenure as chief prosecutor of the Tainan office, Tsai said he was
responsible for direct contact with the Lions' general manager.</P>
      <P>"Through our cooperative mechanism, our office sent a prosecutor to watch every
game held in Tainan City and organized legal courses for the team's management
personnel and players regularly, " Tsai elaborated.</P>
      <P>"In so doing, we have not only helped deter gangsters or crime syndicates from
trying to tempt players into gambling or throwing games but also has allowed the
prosecutors office to use its judicial resources to help the team's management,"
he added.</P>
      <P>The program has proved successful as the Uni-President Lions are the only team
in Taiwan's Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) that has not seen any of
its players implicated in the recent game-fixing scandal, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>He said the MOJ will suggest at next week's interministerial meeting that local
prosecutors offices be encouraged to forge close cooperative ties with the three
other CPBL teams to help prevent the recurrence of game-fixing or gambling
scandals in the future.</P>
      <P>Sports Affairs Council Minister Tai Hsia-ling said earlier in the day that the
government will convene a cross-agency meeting next Tuesday to discuss how to
help keep the CPBL afloat after dozens of players, including 12 from the
country's most popular team the Brother Elephants, were allegedly involved in
game-fixing during the just-concluded baseball season.</P>
      <P>Prosecutorial authorities in Taipei have formally listed eight players as
suspects in the latest game-fixing case and at least four Elephants players have
confessed to prosecutors their involvement in the case.</P>
      <P>After meeting with Elephants general manager Hung Rei-ho, Tai said both she and
Hung  hope that  prosecutors  and criminal investigators can adopt preventive
strategies to address gambling and game-fixing issues that have often cast a
pall on the local professional baseball development.</P>
      <P>Since 1996, five major game-fixing scandals have been reported.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Hung  criticized  both the government  and law enforcement
authorities for their failure to take effective steps in the past to prevent
underworld crime syndicates from rigging baseball games.</P>
      <P>Hung also expressed strong displeasure with prosecutors' failure to inform his
team's management when they detected his players' contacts with underground
bookmakers in the first place.</P>
      <P>"They should have alerted us earlier instead of waiting until the conclusion of
the baseball season, " Hung complained, adding that the prosecutorial
authorities' work style would only hinder the CPBL's development.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of economic crimes in Taiwan are down slightly so far this year
mainly because of the dramatic decrease in intellectual property right (IPR)
infringements, the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) said Friday.</P>
      <P>The authorities cracked down on 8,314 economic crime cases during the first nine
months of this year, 52 fewer than during the same period last year, the MOI
said.</P>
      <P>To protect legal businesses and the rights of consumers, the authorities have
regularly cracked down on IPR infringement and counterfeit goods.</P>
      <P>The authorities also tracked 12,033 suspects, up 1,139 from the same period last
year, mainly because of an increase in financial violation suspects.</P>
      <P>The MOI said that of the economic crime cases investigated during the first nine
months of year, IPR infringements (47.5 percent) account for the biggest number
followed by financial crimes (31.5 percent).</P>
      <P>Economic crimes involved a total of NT$16.2 billion (US$498.46 million) in the
first nine months, with financial crimes accounting for 47.3 percent of the
total, while the IPR violations accounted for 43.6 percent.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou Friday told candidates running for seats of the
Kuomintang's Central Standing Committee (CSC) that the party needs to prove to
the world it can run a clean election.</P>
      <P>In his capacity as chairman of the ruling party, President Ma stressed that the
by-election of 32 CSC members on Nov. 14 is a matter vital to CSC credibility as
well as party image.</P>
      <P>Ma spoke of how unbearable it was for the KMT to be accused of being a vote-
buying party and how hard it was to refute since four KMT-affiliated legislators
were forced to step down after being convicted of vote-buying charges over the
past few months.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the KMT Disciplinary Committee was determined to eliminate
vote-bribery because the nation's politics was closely related to the integrity

    <HEADLINE>U.S. urged to address local consumers' concerns over beef safety</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  30 (CNA)
10/30/09  23:40:18
(By George Liu &amp; Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several American experts in Taiwan affairs urged the United States Friday to
give assurances to Taiwanese consumers on the safety of U.S. beef products with
scientific evidence.</P>
      <P>Criticism has been mounting against a Taiwanese government decision to open its
doors wider to imports of U.S. beef products because of the concerns over the
safety risk of U.S. beef.</P>
      <P>Officials of the Taiwan and the U.S. on Oct. 22 clinched an accord in Washington
to lift a partial ban on U.S. beef products.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the new accord, U.S. bone-in beef, ground beef, intestines,
brains, spinal cords and processed beef from cattle younger than 30 months that
have not been contaminated with "specific risk materials" will be allowed to
enter Taiwan starting Nov. 10.</P>
      <P>Specific risk materials are defined in the protocol as brains, skulls, eyes,
trigeminal ganglia, spinal cords, vertebral columns and dorsal root ganglia from
cattle 30 months of age and older, or tonsils and the distal ileum of the small
intestine from cattle of all ages.</P>
      <P>Alan Romberg, a former U.S. State Department deputy spokesman and now a
distinguished fellow with the Henry L. Stimson Center, told the Central News
Agency that it was no surprise that Taiwan's people are nervous about the import
of U.S. beef, since food safety is a sensitive issue in almost all countries of
the world.</P>
      <P>He added that it's understandable that Taiwan's public ask its government to
strictly screen imports of foreign products, including vehicles, toys, cosmetics
and beef.</P>
      <P>Romberg suggested  that authorities  of both nations apply scientific evidence
to convince Taiwanese consumers that U.S. beef products are safe.</P>
      <P>Vincent Wei-cheng Wang, director of the Department of Political Science at the
University of Richmond, urged the U.S. government, especially the American
Institute in Taiwan, which represents U.S. interests in Taiwan in the absence of
formal relations, to give a guarantee to Taiwan's people that the U.S. will not
allow any of its beef products with safety risks to be exported to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang said many Taiwanese people, while worried about the safety of U.S. beef,
believe the island was forced to open its beef market because of intense
pressure from the U.S., and that Taiwan did not receive any obvious U.S.
concessions in return.</P>
      <P>He suggested that Taiwan make good use of the "opposition strength (among its
people) " by asking the U.S. to give something in return,  such as resuming
Taiwan-U.S. talks on the trade and investment framework agreement (TIFA),
signing a free trade agreement (FTA), and sending Cabinet officials to visit
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>That would help convince Taiwan's people that their government did not get the
short end of the deal in negotiations with the U.S., Wang said.</P>
      <P>On Premier Wu Den-yih's remarks the previous day that his government will not
allow U.S. ground beef and offal to appear in Taiwan's market, as it will not
approve applications for imports of such products, Romberg said that it would
not be appropriate for Taiwan to resort to "technical" means to boycott the
imports so as to avoid unnecessary worries about safety on the part of
consumers.</P>
      <P>Wang said that under WTO regulations, such a technical boycott is not
acceptable, and what Taiwan can do now is to enhance food safety checks, which
he said would force U.S. beef exporters to care more about the safety of their
products.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taiwan only allows imports of U.S. boneless beef from cattle younger
than 30 months that contain no specified risk materials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>H1N1 immunization campaign to kick off Nov. 1</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's immunization program for influenza A (H1N1) , or swine flu,
will kick off Nov. 1 across the country, and the public will be entitled to take
shots at designated spots based on a priority list, the Central Epidemics
Command Center (CECC) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Steve Kuo, director of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the Cabinet-
level Department of Health (DOH) , said HIN1 vaccinations will be given in
several stages to individuals in 12 vulnerable groups based on a DOH-set
priority list to avoid possible chaos.</P>
      <P>Some 6,000 people displaced by Typhoon Morakot in early August, who are being
housed at 22 shelters,  and medical  personnel responsible for disease control
and prevention, will be the first in line to be immunized, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>They will be followed by pregnant women, pre-school children above one year of
age and seriously ill patients, in that order.</P>
      <P>Some 3.6 million elementary, junior and senior high school students will be the
next group to be vaccinated, beginning Nov. 12.</P>
      <P>To complete the immunization program, which is expected to extend until the
Chinese New Year holiday early next year, the DOH has purchased a total of 15
million H1N1 doses of the vaccine from local and foreign companies -- a level
sufficient to cover the anticipated local demand of 12 million doses.</P>
      <P>According to the DOH plan, 5 million doses of H1N1 vaccine manufactured by
Swiss-based pharmaceutical firm Novartis will be first used for high-risk
individuals, while 10 million doses to be supplied by local manufacturer
Adimmune Corp. will be in place in early November.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-chung, public health bureau chief of southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung
County, said 2,100 Morakot typhoon refugees housed at four shelters will be
vaccinated from Nov. 1.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung County, the area hardest hit by the storm, has initially been
allocated more than 30,000 doses of H1N1 vaccine by the central government,
Huang noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the offshore Kinmen County will begin immunizing medical personnel on
Nov. 2. It will get 40,500 doses of HIN1 vaccines from the central government,
compared to some 60,000 people who permanently reside there.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Education (MOE) warned that the H1N1 virus is
expected to reach its peak in November, and urged schools nationwide to suspend
large-scale activities during that month and to swiftly cancel classes in line
with a set of MOE guidelines as necessary.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cabinet to submit U.S. beef import protocol to legislature</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Executive Yuan on Friday promised to submit the new Taiwan-U.S. beef trade
protocol to the Legislative Yuan for reference in a month, ruling Kuomintang
(KMT) Legislator Lu Hsueh-chang has confirmed.</P>
      <P>Cabinet Secretary-General Lin Jhong-shen made the promise after reaching a
consensus with the KMT legislative caucus, Lu said.</P>
      <P>The legislator also expected that the Department of Health (DOH) should brief
relevant legislative committees on the issue, because "in compliance with a 2006
legislative resolution, the DOH is required to provide detailed reports about
the importation of U.S. beef to the legislature."</P>
      <P>The KMT legislative caucus would not rule out the possibility of sending the
document for committee review, Lu said.</P>
      <P>The new protocol is an administrative accord that would normally take effect
after being approved by the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Under the Exercise of Powers by Legislative Yuan Law, any administrative order
enacted by government agencies is then delivered to the legislature and put up
for discussion in a legislative committee meeting.</P>
      <P>If more than 15 legislators attending the meeting agree, the administrative
order will then be handed to related legislative committees for review, Lu said.</P>
      <P>That is not likely in the KMT-controlled legislature, but Lu would not rule out
the possibility. He added that if the protocol were sent to related committees,
its screening should be completed within three months.</P>
      <P>If the deadline expires, the protocol will be considered approved by default, Lu
said.</P>
      <P>After the Department of Health announced Oct. 23 the relaxation of import
restrictions on U.S. beef products, effective from as early as Nov. 2, the KMT

    <HEADLINE>European trade group urges Taiwan to sign trade deals with China</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei-based European Chamber of Commerce (ECCT) has called on Taiwan to
embrace trade agreements with China and the European Union, contending that such
deals will secure its position in the new economic world order.</P>
      <P>ECCT Chairman Philippe Pellegrin said that as economies across the world begin
to bounce back from recession, Taiwan needs to respond to the competitive threat
posed by the network of free trade agreements in Asia.</P>
      <P>"Signing the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) with China is vital
to the continuing competitiveness of Taiwan's export industries and therefore
essential to foreign investment in Taiwan, " Pellegrin said.</P>
      <P>"By reintegrating into the global and regional economy, Taiwan will be able to
secure its position as an important link between China and Europe," he added.</P>
      <P>Pellegrin was speaking at an ECCT monthly luncheon held the previous day in
which the trade group released its 2009-2010 Position Papers, centered around
the theme "Bouncing back -- finding a place in the new economic world order:
EU-Taiwan --  a spirit of cooperation."</P>
      <P>The first copy of the report was officially handed over to the government's
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) at the luncheon.</P>
      <P>Pellegrin argued that the sooner Taiwan signs an ECFA with China, the quicker
political impediments to other countries, including the EU, signing economic
agreements with Taiwan will be removed.</P>
      <P>"An ECFA would provide Taiwan with new business opportunities and help to create
much needed jobs," he contended.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China will hold informal talks on the ECFA deal in Beijing Nov. 3-4.
Taiwan hopes to seal an ECFA agreement with China as soon as possible to reduce
the impact on Taiwanese exporters of the economic integration of China and the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which will come into force next
year.</P>
      <P>The ECCT also called on the Cabinet to take ownership of and commit to a Trade
Enhancement Measures (TEM) agreement with Europe, especially given the current
tough economic times.</P>
      <P>The combination of the global recession and the after effects of Typhoon Marakot
have left Taiwan's economy in a weakened state, according to the ECCT, citing
Taiwan's declining imports and exports, 6 percent unemployment, and a 51 percent
year-on-year decline in foreign direct investment in Taiwan during the first
eight months of the year.</P>
      <P>The European trade group estimates that TEM trade liberalization measures would
boost the EU's gross domestic product (GDP) by 2 billion euros (US$2.95 billion)
and Taiwan's GDP by 3.8 billion euros, creating more jobs and output for both
sides.</P>
      <P>The ECCT,  founded in 1988,  is the foremost organization championing the
business interests of European companies in Taiwan. It represents  around  700
members  from  420 companies  and organizations.</P>

conference are to give information on Taiwanese and  French  engineering
studies  systems,  performances  and international strategies; to help Taiwanese
and French engineering studies  institutions  building  partnerships;  and  to
promote engineering studies and international mobility among the students, " the
statement said.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan's Ministry of Education,  around 9,000 Taiwanese students
chose European countries for advanced studies in 2008, representing a quarter of
the Taiwanese studying abroad. In the last 10 years, the number of Taiwanese
students in France has tripled and the number in Germany has doubled.</P>

      <P>A huge LED panel on the banks of Shanghai's Huangpu River flashes the Chinese
characters "Taipei welcomes you."</P>
      <P>The greeting is followed by information  about the Taipei International Flora
Exposition, which is slated to open in Taipei next year.</P>
      <P>The 6,000 square-meter LED panel on the exterior wall of a building is one of
the most eye-catching advertising boards in Shanghai, especially at night when
its colorful light is reflected on the surface of the Huangpu River, and Taipei
Mayor Hau Lung-bin hopes it will pay dividends for his city.</P>
      <P>The huge advertisement, which made its debut in Shanghai Friday night,
symbolizes the mayor's ambitious campaign to draw 6 million visitors to the 2010
fair, the first major international exposition to be held in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tuo Chung-hwa, chief of the city's Department of Information and Tourism, was in
Shanghai to promote the expo and witnessed the advertisement's debut.</P>
      <P>He told a group of journalists aboard a boat on the river that Taipei hopes to
tap into this potential market of Chinese and foreign visitors to the flora show
by sending a greeting to residents of Shanghai first.</P>
      <P>The electronic ad will run 65 times a day and 15 seconds each time for 15 days,
Tuo said.</P>
      <P>"We chose the most dazzling spot in China's most populous city to run the ad and
extend our invitation to Chinese people as well as foreigners visiting the
city," Tuo said.</P>
      <P>The LED panel display is only one element in Taipei's campaign to sell the expo
in China. Taipei has also placed advertisements on the sides of Shanghai buses
running on 14 routes in the city's bustling areas, according to Tuo.</P>
      <P>Tuo said his office has also approached Taiwanese and Chinese airlines that fly
between Shanghai and Taipei to offer discounted tickets and tours to expo
visitors.</P>
      <P>The 2010 Taipei International Flora Exposition will be held from November 6,
2010 to April 25, 2011. This is the first time the event will be held in Taiwan.
Taipei is the seventh city in Asia to host such a gardening expo.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has been ranked second in Asia in business sophistication, enhancing the
country's productivity and competitiveness, the Council for Economic Planning
and Development (CEPD) said Saturday, citing a report by the World Economic
Forum (WEF).</P>
      <P>Taiwan's business sophistication scored 5.22 on a scale of 1-7 in the WEF's
Global Competitiveness  Report 2009-2010 released in September, the 13th highest
worldwide and the best ranking Taiwan has obtained since 2005.</P>
      <P>In Asia, Taiwan's business sophistication finished second only to Japan but was
ahead of Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea and China.</P>
      <P>The criteria used by the WEF to evaluate business sophistication include local
supplier quantity and quality, state of cluster development, nature of
competitive advantage and value chain breadth.</P>
      <P>Others are control of international distribution, production process
sophistication, extent of marketing and willingness to delegate authority.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's overall competitiveness ranking was up five notches to 12th place,
compared to last year.</P>
      <P>The report attributes Taiwan's significant progress to the fact that the country
has fully developed into an innovation-driven economy -- the third and most
advanced stage of development as defined by the Global Competitiveness Index
framework.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The normally reserved Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (JCCI) in Taipei
recently called on Taiwan and Japan to establish a channel for direct talks
between officials at the ministerial level.</P>
      <P>In its first-ever annual white paper released Oct. 23, the JCCI said government-
level dialogue was necessary to deal with trade disputes and marketing problems
challenging Japanese businesses operating in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Such dialogue is difficult at present, however, because of the lack of
diplomatic ties between Taiwan and Japan.</P>
      <P>Over the past 33 years, Taiwan's Association of East Asia Relations has been
commissioned to handle trade and economic issues with its Japanese counterpart,
the Interchange Association, through an annual working-level meeting.</P>
      <P>A new opportunity may have arisen, however, since President Ma Ying-jeou took
office on May 20, 2008. Cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges have been greatly boosted
and expanded, which consequently have also led to more exchanges between Taiwan
and East Asian and Southeast Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Those trends could have a positive influence on relatively cold Taiwan-Japan
exchanges, the paper said, and for businesses to adjust to the anticipated
change, the JCCI urged the two countries to pursue higher-level dialogue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Japanese business group also expressed the hope that Taiwan's
government and people will send more information on Taiwan to Japan through a
wide range of different channels.</P>
      <P>The white paper pointed out that there is little information transmitted to
Japan on daily life and economic activity in Taiwan, leading to a general lack
of understanding of Taiwan's leading businesses and the generally pro-Japanese
attitudes of its people.</P>
      <P>The more Japanese businesses know about Taiwanese companies, such as Hon Hai
Precision Industry, Quanta Computer and ASUSTek Computer, which were among
China's top 10 exporters in 2008, the better the chance they will seek
cooperation with them, including in the mainland market, the JCCI said.</P>
      <P>Unlike the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei or the European Chamber of
Commerce Taipei, the JCCI in Taipei, founded in 1971, has been relatively
inactive, rarely delivering opinions and making suggestions to the government
agencies here.</P>
      <P>The low-profile approach changed, however,  as cross-strait relations have
improved under Ma's administration. Prior to issuing the white paper, the JCCI,
which now represents 420 Japanese businesses  in  Taiwan,  presented  a proposal
containing  42 recommendations to Taiwan's government last September.</P>
      <P>The 2009  white  paper  further  expanded  the number  of recommendations to 59
on topics ranging from regional peace to medical treatment systems that the
group said fully conveys its members' opinions.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chao Shou-po, the head of Taiwan's professional baseball league, said Saturday
in Kuala Lumpur that he will try to convince the general manager of the Brother
Elephants not to disband  his team for the sake of pro baseball's  future
development.</P>
      <P>Elephants general manager Hung Rei-ho is considering disbanding the team -- one
of only four in Taiwan's Chinese Professional Baseball League -- after 12 of his
players have been implicated in colluding with gambling syndicates to throw
games in the recently concluded CPBL regular season.</P>
      <P>Four have reportedly confessed to accepting money in exchange for throwing
games.</P>
      <P>As one of the two teams that have been in the league since it was founded 20
years ago and the franchise with the strongest fan base, the Elephants'
disappearance could spell the demise of the CPBL, as Chao acknowledged.</P>
      <P>"How can the professional baseball league carry on with only three teams? " Chao
said in an interview with the Central News Agency in Malaysia, where he is
attending the Asia Pacific Boy Scouts Jamboree.</P>
      <P>But Chao, who was speaking publicly for the first time since the scandal
erupted, believed the Brother Elephants could still be salvaged.</P>
      <P>"Even with half of the players involved, the team can fire them and recruit new
members. Besides, the problem has only involved players, not management," he
said.</P>
      <P>Chao suggested that fans would recover their confidence in the Brother Elephants
if they added good players with integrity, comparing the challenge to companies
restoring their images after suffering serious debacles.</P>
      <P>The CPBL president also criticized prosecutors for their handling of the case,
arguing that they had violated the principle of confidentiality during the
investigation.</P>
      <P>He accused them of leaking information that "destroyed players' lives and
sacrificing the reputation of the league and the teams."</P>
      <P>"They not only released names but also said that more than half the players on
the Elephants were involved. Isn't that violating confidentiality? They also
said pro baseball has played its last game," an agitated Chao scoffed.</P>
      <P>He was particularly irked by prosecutors' comments that the players "willingly"
engaged in the game-fixing scheme.</P>
      <P>"If there had not been anybody tempting the players, would they have contacted
the bookies on their own?" Chao asked.</P>
      <P>He urged judicial authorities and the government to crack down on the gambling
syndicates that have been behind five major scandals in the league's 20-year
history but have rarely been convicted for their crimes or had seen their cases
drag on for nearly a decade.</P>
      <P>"The fundamental solution is for the government to show real determination in
prosecuting and punishing illegal syndicates, " Chao said.</P>

      <P>When studying at National Taiwan University (NTU) , Wu was received by late

      <P>The corps was established by Chiang in 1952 with the initial purpose of
providing quasi-military training for youngsters before they were conscripted
into the military, but it gradually shifted its focus to providing educational

      <P>Several of Taiwan's diplomatic allies from Central America and the Caribbean are
participating in the Taipei International Travel Fair (ITF), offering
information and incentives to attract local residents to their countries.</P>
      <P>"The thing about Saint Kitts is that you can have the natural and exclusive
vacation and in that it is still very unspoiled, both Saint Kitts and Nevis. We
still have maintained our natural environment, " Jasmine  Huggins,  charge
d'affaires  of the Embassy of Saint Christopher and Nevis in Taipei, told the
Central News Agency at the fair Saturday.</P>
      <P>"We are not so overrun with tourists yet, so the person who travels to Saint
Kitts can enjoy a peaceful and relaxing vacation, " she added.</P>
      <P>Huggins said she hopes to attract more Taiwanese tourists to her country,  which
is rich in natural,  cultural  and historical attractions, ranging from
Brimstone Hill Fortress National Park -- a United Nations Educational,
Scientific, and Cultural Organization World Heritage Site -- to hot spring and
crystal clear water along the coastline.</P>
      <P>The best time for Taiwanese tourists to visit the Caribbean country is during
winter, when there are Christmas celebrations, carnivals and other activities,
Huggins said.</P>
      <P>Several Central American allies, including Panama, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Belize,
Honduras and El Salvador, are also participating in the fair.</P>
      <P>Lucas Yeh, assistant director of the Central America Trade Office in Taipei,
told CNA that due to a lack of knowledge of the area and language barriers,
travel packages to Central America are not as attractive as those to Europe,
which are priced in a similar range.</P>
      <P>Yeh noted, however, that these Central American countries should be of interest
to experienced travelers and cultural enthusiasts.</P>
      <P>Guatemala and Honduras are rich in Mayan civilization relics, while Nicaragua
and Costa Rica are known for their volcanic geography, according to Yeh.</P>
      <P>For those who are interested in natural scenery, the world's second largest
barrier reef is located along the coast of Belize and Honduras.</P>
      <P>In recent years, individual tours have become an increasingly popular form of
travel among young people worldwide, Yeh said, and he encouraged those
interested in planning this form of tourism to visit the fair to gather
information for their travel plans.</P>
      <P>Organized by the Taiwan Visitors Association, this year's ITF, which will run

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou reiterated Saturday his promise that he will not
compromise on funding for education, even though Taiwan's economy remains weak.</P>
      <P>The education budget for 2010 will be NT$15.9 billion (US$487 million) higher
than the previous year, at a time when the overall central government budget
will remain flat due to the economic slowdown, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"Education should not be compromised by poverty, and children should not be
affected by adversity. Education is so important to a country that no
investments should be delayed," he said.</P>
      <P>Ma underlined his support for education during a visit to National Chung Hsing
University in the central Taiwan city of Taichung, where he attended a
celebration of the school's 90th birthday.</P>
      <P>The NT$15.9 billion increase, however, is lower than the 0.2 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP) -- or about NT$24 billion -- that Ma pledged during his
election campaign would be added to the government's education budget every
year.</P>
      <P>At the time, Ma promised to raise the share of the education budget from 4.4
percent to 6 percent of GDP if he served as president for eight years.</P>
      <P>He fulfilled the promise in 2009 by increasing spending on education by NT$26
billion, but is likely to fall short this year.</P>
      <P>But Ma explained that education funding will still rise despite budget
constraints due to potentially large fiscal deficits resulting from the economic
slump and the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>He apologized for not being able to fulfill his promise on education in 2010 but
reiterated he will do his utmost to satisfy the needs of the education sector

artists cannot be eligible for standard retirement and other insurance benefits.</P>
      <P>Many artists, for example, are currently defined as unemployed, which means they
will only receive a pension of NT$3,000 per month after turning 65, far less
than the maximum amount of around NT$9,000 for other individuals under Taiwan's
existing national pension program.</P>
      <P>Tang urged the government to follow the example of Germany, which recognized art
creators as professionals by setting up an artist insurance system in 1983 to
include them in pension, health insurance and other welfare systems.</P>
      <P>At a time when the government is claiming that it is putting a greater emphasis
on creative industries, Tang said a better social safety net is urgently needed
to better protect workers in the arts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Vice premier promotes travel to Taoyuan's Cihu</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31 (CNA)

      <P>Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu on Saturday returned to Taoyuan County where he
served as county chief to promote the Cihu Travel Festival, which the local
government organized to boost tourism.</P>
      <P>Chu touted a cultural park in the Cihu area built near the mausoleum of the late
President Chiang Kai-shek, saying the park has undergone many renovations in
recent years to expand its scale and should attract more Chinese and foreign
tourists in the future.</P>
      <P>The latest renovation was performed on the Touliao ecological footpath, which
links together the key tourist attractions in the park, including the CKS
Memorial Sculpture Park, the Cihu Mausoleum and the scenic "Back Cihu" area
situated behind the mausoleum.</P>
      <P>On Saturday,  the 1.2 kilometer-long footpath was formally reopened after the
renovation.</P>
      <P>Cihu -- also spelled Tzuhu -- is located in Taoyuan County's Dasi township and
refers to a lake located near Chiang Kai-shek's mausoleum.</P>
      <P>Originally called "Horn South Pond" because of its shape, the lake was renamed
by Chiang Kai-shek in memory of his mother because the scenery in the area
reminded him of his hometown of Sikou in eastern China's Zhejiang Province.</P>
      <P>Chiang built one of his residences there in 1959, which became his favorite. The
building was converted into a temporary mausoleum after his death on April 5,
1975 and opened to visitors.</P>
      <P>The neighboring Touliao Mausoleum, called the Touliao Guest House when it was
built in 1966, was renamed when Chiang Ching-kuo passed away on Jan. 13, 1988
and was entombed there on Jan. 30 of the same year.</P>
      <P>Realizing the tourism value of the venues, the Taoyuan County government has in
recent years created the Chiang Family Culture Park in Dasi, which integrates
period pieces and buildings related to the two late presidents, while Back Cihu
-- which was previously closed to the public -- has been converted into a site
for concerts and other public events.</P>

    <HEADLINE>H1N1 immunization program may suffer from health worker shortage</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Local public health offices around the island are worried that there will be too
few medical workers available to carry out the H1N1 flu immunization program
that is expected to begin Sunday.</P>
      <P>An official with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said Saturday that so far
only 500 contracted hospitals have registered to participate in the H1N1
inoculation program, compared to 3,500 hospitals that signed up to offer free
shots for seasonal flu.</P>
      <P>Yet while only 2.99 million doses of the seasonal flu vaccine are being
distributed, the CDC is expecting to give 12 million shots of the H1N1 vaccine
by the Chinese New Year holiday early next year.</P>
      <P>That has led health authorities to conclude that health care workers at the 500
contracted hospitals will definitely be far from sufficient to carry out the
immunization program, according to the official.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ho Mei-hsiang, director of the research department of domestic
vaccine manufacturer Adimmune, said Saturday that the company is still waiting
for the Department of Health (DOH) to pick up H1N1 vaccine that the company has
already produced, even though the vaccine's certification process has almost
been completed.</P>
