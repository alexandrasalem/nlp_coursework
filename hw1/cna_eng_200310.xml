    <HEADLINE>DPP TO FORM CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM PANEL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will form a special panel to flesh out President Chen
Shui-bian's appeal to introduce a new constitution for Taiwan in
2006, a party official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung told a news conference
that the decision to form a constitutional reform panel was reached
at a meeting of senior officials from the Presidential Office, the
Cabinet and DPP headquarters a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Chang said the new panel, to be jointly headed by himself and
Chiou I-jen, President Chen's chief of staff, will be composed of
scholars, experts, and DPP heavyweights.</P>
      <P>The panel will study 11 major topics concerning Taiwan's
constitutional reform, including a 50 percent cut of the seats in the
Legislative Yuan, the legislative electoral system, the central
government system -- a parliamentary system or an outright
presidential system -- and a three-level or two-level administrative
system, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Addressing a Sunday rally in Taichung marking the Democratic
Progressive Party's 17th founding anniversary, President Chen said in
his capacity as the ruling party's chairman that in 2006, when the
DPP turns 20 years old, he hopes all of the 23 million people of
Taiwan will push for a new constitution.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks have drawn broadsides from opposition parties at
home and caused concern among U.S. authorities about whether the "new
constitution" call is a move to promote Taiwan's de jure independence
which could provoke a military attack from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chang said Chen's call for a new constitution was mainly aimed at
spearheading a process of constitutional reform to craft a political
framework that would fit Taiwan's present realities.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Chang paid a visit to the DPP's legislative
caucus to brief its members on the party headquarters' new decision.
He said after meeting with DPP legislative whips that the party
headquarters and the legislative caucus shared views on
constitutional reform issues. He said the DPP legislative caucus will
also form a nine-member task force to push for constitutional reform.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP Deputy Secretary-General Lee Ying-yuan said the
"pan-blue alliance's" presidential and vice presidential candidates
for next year's election -- Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and People
First Party Chairman James Soong -- should present their views on
three major constitutional reform issues for public discussion.</P>
      <P>The three issues are whether they support a presidential system
or a dual-leadership system, whether they would resurrect the already
marginalized Taiwan provincial government should they win the 2004
election, and whether they think that the vice president should be
allowed to concurrently serve as premier.</P>
      <P>"Constitutional reform is by no means 'boring' as claimed by the
'pan-blue' leaders. They should face up to all relevant issues
squarely because these topics are critical to our nation's future
development," Lee said.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT) is not opposed to
revising the ROC Constitution; however, it has its own proposals
which will be put forward after listening to public opinion and
consulting with other political parties, KMT Chairman Lien Chan said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Three days after President Chen Shui-bian sending shockwaves
through political circles by pledging to draw up a new constitution
for the country by 2006, Lien said the key to revising the
constitution lies in negotiations rather than a unilateral
declaration.</P>
      <P>However, the KMT chief, who will run for president in the 2004
election, said his party wants to address the problem that the public
is most concerned about, which is not if the country should unite
with the mainland, but how to boost the nation's sagging economy and
improve the lives of its people.</P>
      <P>Many of the current economic problems result from the fact that
the government's economic policy was dictated by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's political preferences and its desire
to win the 2004 presidential election, Lien claimed.</P>
      <P>As a way to win support for his presidential bid, Lien said the
KMT and its political ally in the presidential election, the People
First Party, will come up with a program to better the country's
investment environment, sharpen its competitiveness, reform the
financial system and protect the interests of farmers and laborers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE YUAN APPROVES TAIWAN-PANAMA FREE TRADE AGREEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan approved a free trade
agreement (FTA) Wednesday signed by Taiwan and Panama, making the
accord the first of its kind for Taiwan after the country entered the
World Trade Organization (WTO) in Jan. 2002.</P>
      <P>However, a resolution was attached to the passage because of its
"flawed signing process" despite praise and encouragement by
lawmakers from various political parties who expressed the hope that
the pact would boost bilateral trade and economic exchanges between
the two countries and help lay a sound foundation for similar
agreements between Taiwan and other friendly nations.</P>
      <P>The resolution requires that all agencies under the Executive
Yuan must first gain legislative approval from now on in compliance
with a constitutional requirement before they clinch bilateral or
multilateral accords with other countries. The Executive Yuan also is
required to make reports to legislative committees when encountering
contradictory cases.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Shu Yuan-kuo of the opposition People First Party said
the legislature was forced to accept the pact previously inked by
President Chen Shui-bian and Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso on
Aug. 21 in Taipei, while Chiang Yi-wen claimed that she also felt the
Legislative Yuan was "looked down upon, " despite her happiness about
the agreement.</P>
      <P>Legislator Sun Kuo-hua of the major opposition Kuomintang hailed
the Taiwan-Panama FTA as an encouraging breakthrough, and said he
deeply hoped that the pact will set a framework for Taiwan to obtain
such accords with other states.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan-Panama FTA, which is to become effective on Jan. 1,
2004, is composed of 21 chapters, focusing on market access, service,
investment and technical cooperation.</P>
      <P>During the next 10-year period from the beginning of the next
year, 97 percent of Taiwan-made industrial product items will be
available to enter the Panamanian market on a zero-tariff basis,
while 95 percent from Panama will be allowed to be imported into
Taiwan under the same treatment.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Taiwan's shipping, telecommunications and
financial service industries will be given a boost to explore the
Panamanian market, which is an ideal springboard to make inroad into
American and international markets.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLITICAL PARTIES TO BE FINED IF THEIR NOMINEES ARE CONVICTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Political parties will be fined if their
nominees for public elections are convicted of vote-buying, organized
crime or other felonies, according to a draft package of amendments
to the existing election and recall law.</P>
      <P>The package, drafted by the Ministry of the Interior, stipulates
that parties will be slapped with a fine of between NT$500,000 and
NT$5 million if any of their candidates is convicted of vote-buying,
use of violence in the campaign process, candidacy fixing, organized
crime or other felonies subject to a minimum 10-year prison term.</P>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said after the Cabinet approved the basket of
amendments to the Public Officials Election and Recall Law at its
weekly meeting that the new penal regulation is aimed at pushing
political parties to be more prudent in nominating their
standard-bearers in public elections and thereby allowing the
establishment of clean politics.</P>
      <P>Yu said that although the election and recall law has undergone
several small rounds of revisions since its enactment in 1980, it is
still insufficient to cope with changing political and economic
conditions.</P>
      <P>"The newly drafted package marks the largest-ever amendments to
the law, " Yu said. "The package will be referred to the Legislative
Yuan for deliberation and I hope the legislature can complete
screening as soon as possible to help speed up political reform."</P>
      <P>In addition to strengthening the mechanism to prevent those with
links to organized crime from entering politics, the package also
proposes penalties for vote-buying in intraparty primary elections.</P>
      <P>Moreover, those involved in vote-buying in the elections of
speakers and deputy speakers of legislative councils at central and
local levels could be given prison terms ranging between three and 10
years plus fines ranging between NT$1 million and NT$10 million.</P>
      <P>The draft package also lifts a controversial ban that prohibits
police officers and students from becoming candidates for public
elections. Once the package clears the legislature, police officers
and adult students will be eligible to run for public office.</P>
      <P>In addition, the package clearly forbids political parties or
individuals from publishing, reporting or quoting the results of
election public opinion polls within 10 days of a political election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE  TO COVER  HEPATITIS B, C PATIENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Bureau of National Health Insurance
(BNHI) started a new program Wednesday to cover the treatment of
hepatitis B and C.</P>
      <P>BNHI officials said that both new and existing sufferers will be
covered under the new program.</P>
      <P>The officials said an annual budget of NT$1.2 billion (US$ 5.5
million) has been appropriated for the new program, but as there are
only three months left of this year, the budget for the remainder of
the year will be NT$400 million.</P>
      <P>Liver disease is sometimes called Taiwan's "national disease"
because of the large number of people with liver afflictions. It is
estimated that the number of hepatitis B carriers in Taiwan is
between 2.5 million and 3 million, and that the number of hepatitis C
carriers is around 300,000.</P>
      <P>As the medicines are expensive and the national health insurance
previously has refused to provide coverage for treatment, few people
receive treatment and the hepatitis usually deteriorates into
cirrhosis and eventually liver cancer.</P>
      <P>At the repeated urging of the medical profession, the BNHI has
finally decided to cover the cost of the medicine, including
expensive drugs such as lamivudine and ribavirin.</P>
      <P>BNHI officials said that after a three-month trial period, the
program will be reviewed to decide if the scale needs to be further
expanded.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the bureau will also set up a
registration system to monitor the condition of patients receiving
medication.</P>
      <P>The officials said that at present, 84 hospitals are eligible to
join the new program, all of which are regional-level or higher.
Patients will be able to receive a one-month supply of medication at
a time.</P>
      <P>Doctors have said that the combination of the drug interferon
with ribavirin has shown dramatic effects in curing hepatitis C,
although the medication is less effective in the treatment of
hepatitis B.</P>

      <P>The prototype of the vessel completed its sea trials last
September and the first of the craft was delivered to the navy in

in Taiwan, was demonstrated during the Hankuang 19 live-fire combined

missiles.</P>
      <P>The new generation fast attack boat, is 34.2 meters long, 7.6
meters wide, four meters high and has a maximum speed of 33 knots.

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Bird conservationists said Wednesday that
they might have to wait for the arrival of the next cold front to see
alarge number of black-faced spoonbills coming to their main
wintering habitat in Tainan County, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The first of the endangered birds arrived at the Chiku wetlands
Sept. 26, to the excitement of bird watchers, but no others have been
spotted as yet.</P>
      <P>Experts said that the lone bird came to Chiku early and suspect
that the seven-year-old adult might not have found a partner and had
therefore migrated earlier.</P>
      <P>Although the black-faced spoonbills have yet to arrive en masse,
the Tainan county government has made preparations for the winter
guests in an effort to prevent the mass die-offs from botulism that
occurred last winter.</P>
      <P>In addition to a "save the black-faced spoonbill" drill over the
weekend, the government is also mapping out plans for various
agencies to save the endangered birds in case of emergency.</P>
      <P>The Tainan County Livestock Disease Control Center has stepped up
monitoring of the Chiku habitat for traces of botulism. As tests
between June and August showed four feeding sites to be contaminated,
the center sent workers to turn the soil in order to letting the sun
kill off the botulin pathogen. The results of testing at 16 sites in
September have yet to be released.</P>
      <P>Each year, a large proportion of the world's remaining
black-faced spoonbills migrate from the Korean peninsula and
northeastern mainland China to the Chiku wetlands to spend the
winter. More than 700 arrived last year, and the die-off of 71 last
year was the first of its kind.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Over 30 percent of Taiwan's Internet users
look for work online each month, with female job-seekers outnumbering
males, according to the results of a recent survey.</P>
      <P>The poll conducted by Insight Xplorer, a market consulting
company based in Taipei, found that each executive search Web site
received more than 30 percent of Internet users per month during the
June-August period.</P>
      <P>For instance in August, some 3.47 million users -- or 36 percent
of the Taiwan's total 10 million cyber population -- logged on to the
Internet to seek jobs, according to the survey results.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of this year's summer vacation, over 3
million Internet users sought jobs per month on line, with school
students and graduates accounting for the largest portion of 34
percent of the total. Online female job seekers outnumbered their
male counterparts by around 10 percent, an Insight Xplorer official
said.</P>
      <P>Each online job seeker visited executive search Web sites nine
times per month, spending an average 38 minutes during each visit and
browsing 52 pages, he went on.</P>
      <P>Men and women aged between 20 and 30 accounted for the largest
age group of nearly 40 percent of the online job seekers, followed by
24 percent made up of visitors aged between 30 and 40, the survey
discovered.</P>
      <P>In terms of occupation, school students and this year's graduates
accounted for about 34 percent, while white-collar workers came in
second with 22 percent.</P>
      <P>104.com.tw was the most visited executive search site in August,
luring 2.58 million online visitors -- more than 70 percent of the
total job seekers that month in the domestic employment market. 1111.
com.tw, career.com.tw and a site run by the Employment and Vocational
Training Administration under the Council of Labor Affairs were also
popular, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
reported that the number of Taiwan's jobless workers totaled 529,000
in August, representing an unemployment rate of 5.21 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXECUTIVE YUAN PASSES BILL FURTHER LOWERING LAND INCREMENT TAX</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan approved an amendment to
the land laws Wednesday, allowing the increment tax on land value to
be further lowered in a bid to rekindle the domestic real estate and
housing market.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the existing implementation of halved
land value increment taxes is scheduled to expire Jan. 31, 2004, the
Cabinet passed the amendment to lower the increment taxes on land
value to 40 percent, 30 percent and 20 percent, respectively, from
the current levels of 60 percent, 50 percent and 40 percent.</P>
      <P>The amendment is expected to be implemented after it is submitted
to the Legislative Yuan and approved.</P>
      <P>In the first year of the implementation of halved land value
increment taxation, between Feb. 1, 2002 and Jan. 31, 2003, more than
330,000 pieces of land changed hands in transactions, up 40 percent
-- or some 90,000 cases -- over the year-earlier levels, according to
Ministry of Finance (MOF) officials.</P>
      <P>During this period, revenues generated from those transactions
reached NT$50.2 billion (US$14.76 billion), representing an increase
of 26 percent, or NT$10.4 billion, over the year-earlier levels, the
officials added.</P>
      <P>MOF officials said that the halved land value increase taxation
design has had a noticeable effect in rejuvenating Taiwan's real
estate and housing business over the past year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAX REBATE SYSTEM FOR FOREIGN TOURISTS LAUNCHED TO BOOST TOURISM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan launched a tax rebate system for
foreign tourists Wednesday as part of its efforts to rev up its
tourism industry.</P>
      <P>Customs official said that foreign tourists who make one-stop
purchases totalling NT$3,000 (US$88.75) or more at selected shops
during their stay can apply for a 5-percent tax rebate upon their
departure from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Foreign tourists who spend NT$3,000 or more in a shop displaying
the "tax return shopping (TRS) " logo and take the goods out of the
country within 30 days will be eligible to apply for the tax rebate
at the airport upon departure.</P>
      <P>More than 20 department stores around the island have been
selected as TRS shops so far.</P>
      <P>Customs authorities said the new tax rebate measure will cost the
national coffers an estimated NT$700 million (US$20.6 million) in
business tax revenues annually.</P>
      <P>The tax rebate scheme is part of an ambitious tourism promotion
project aimed at doubling the number of tourist arrivals by 2008,
government officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tourism Bureau Director Su Chen-tien said the
government has decided to designate 2004 as Taiwan's "tourism year, "
during which a series of cultural activities, street carnivals and
folk arts exhibitions will be held to attract foreign and overseas
Chinese visitors.</P>
      <P>The programs will include an expanded lantern festival,
carnival-style trade fairs and traditional operatic performances, Su
said, adding that many new tour packages, including ecotours and
trips to new tourist farms, will be presented.</P>
      <P>Su said that although the severe acute respiratory syndrome
outbreaks between March and June this year dealt a severe blow to the
local tourism industry, the number of tourist arrivals has rebounded
since July.</P>
      <P>"In July, more than 154,000 foreign tourists visited Taiwan,
increasing to 206,000 in August. We believe that tourist arrivals
will continue rise in the months ahead," Su said confidently.</P>
      <P>He said the Tourism Bureau will send a delegation of local chefs
to various U.S. cities later this month to demonstrate their culinary
arts and introduce newly developed Chinese cuisine menus as part the
bureau's efforts to attract visitors looking for a taste of delicious
Chinese food.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINESE BATTERIES POISONING TAIWAN: LAWMAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Substandard batteries from mainland China
are increasingly poisoning Taiwan with mercury and other hazardous
mineral waste, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Hsu
Chung-hsiung claimed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference that he organized in conjunction
with the non-profit Environmental Quality Protection Foundation, Hsu
said the mainland dumps about 20,000 tons of substandard batteries in
Taiwan annually without attracting notice from the Taiwan
authorities.</P>
      <P>The batteries, with an average mercury content that is 360 times
larger than those of legally controlled batteries, are posing an
appalling threat to Taiwan's environment and the people's lives,
according to Hsu.</P>
      <P>Hsu called for the Cabinet-level Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) to step up the inspection and interception of
the mainland batteries while raising the retrieval rate of all
batteries disposed of in Taiwan by at least 10 percent.</P>
      <P>The mainland batteries -- many of which are produced in
underground factories and illegally smuggled into Taiwan -- are
easily available on the shelves of NT$10-per-item stores, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>He added that most of them have also been dumped in the Taiwan
market at lower-than-normal prices and carry fake EPA quality
certification marks.</P>
      <P>Hsu also called for the EPA to accelerate the retrieval of
disposed batteries of all kinds, particularly those that are
poisonous or hazardous to the environment.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the disposed battery retrieval rate was about 6.3
percent two years ago. Although the rate had been raised to 10.5
percent in the first four months of this year, the retrieval rate is
still relatively low in comparison with the rates in most
industrially advanced countries.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the EPA set forth and publicize a clear battery
retrieval policy and set a retrieval goal of 30 percent in the first
year of implementation, gradually increasing to 60 percent in three
years.</P>
      <P>Hsu said one tiny button battery can pollute 6,000 tons of water,
equivalent to the amount that a single person consumes in 60 years,
while a lead-acid car battery is capable of causing one square foot
of land to become too toxic to farm forever.</P>
      <P>He warned that some 10,000 tons of used batteries are thrown into
Taiwan's incinerators or landfills each year, polluting an
immeasurable volume of water and air with mercury, lead, chromium and
other depleting elements.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liu Ming-long, secretary-general of the Environmental
Quality Protection Foundation, said mainland batteries are commonly
dumped in Taiwan packed together with cheap toys and games.</P>
      <P>Liu urged the government to strengthen controls on these
products, charging that they not only constitute a hazard to Taiwan's
environment, they also adversely affect the interests of Taiwan's
traders and consumers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene Chien has
returned to Taipei after a visit to the United States, diplomatic
sources said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Chien returned home earlier in the day after presiding over a
working meeting in Baltimore, Maryland, of Taiwan officials stationed
in the United States, " said a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
official who asked to remain anonymous.</P>
      <P>According to the official, Chien took advantage of his visit to
brief U.S. officials on President Chen Shui-bian's idea to push for
the introduction of a new constitution for Taiwan in 2006.</P>
      <P>Addressing a Sunday rally in Taichung marking the Democratic
Progressive Party's 17th founding anniversary, President Chen said in
his capacity as the ruling party's chairman that in 2006, when the
DPP turns 20 years old, he hopes all of the 23 million people of
Taiwan will push for a new constitution.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks have drawn broadsides from opposition parties at
home and caused concern among U.S. authorities about whether the "new
constitution" call is a move to promote Taiwan's de jure independence
which could provoke a military attack from mainland China.</P>
      <P>The MOFA official said Chien explained to U.S. authorities the
main reasons behind Chen's call for a new constitution.</P>
      <P>"Chien told relevant U.S. officials that Taiwan needs to largely
amend its current constitution or enact a new one in order to fit the
island's present realities and facilitate its reforms on various
fronts, including a conscription system overhaul and a reduction in
the number of seats in the Legislative Yuan, " the official said.</P>
      <P>He added that after hearing Chien's explanations, the U.S.
authorities have a better understanding of President Chen's stance.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLAR CLAIMS ORCHID ISLAND ABORIGINES MIGHT HAIL FROM TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taitung, Taiwan, Oct. 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A local archaeologist said Thursday
that the theory that the Tao aborigines residing on Orchid Island
hail from the Philippines island of Bataan is questionable.</P>
      <P>Tsang Chen-hua, curator of the National Museum of Prehistory in
Taitung, eastern Taiwan, said the available archaeological evidence
shows that the Tao people are more likely to have originated from
Taiwan rather than Bataan.</P>
      <P>Tsang said that although the possibility of the Tao people
immigrating from Bataan to Orchid Island -- located some 42
kilometers off the coast of Taitung -- cannot be completely ruled
out, the facts reflected by the evidence should also not be ignored.</P>
      <P>Quoting archaeological documents, Tsang said, people from Taiwan
began traveling to Orchid Island during what is known as the Fine
Corded-Pottery Culture Period more than 4,000 years ago.</P>
      <P>Artifacts unearthed on Orchid Island and Taitung also show that
people from Taiwan continued traveling to Orchid Island during the
Peinan Culture Period some 2,500 years ago, Tsang said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he went on, the Tao people's jar burial tradition more
likely originated in Taiwan. Relics of jars containing human remains
have been excavated at the site for the Tainan Science-based
Industrial Park in southern Taiwan and at several areas in the
eastern counties of Hualien and Taitung.</P>
      <P>According to Tsang, the Tao culture emerged after the Fine
Corded-Pottery Culture Period and the Peinan Culture Period and he
said he has completed an academic paper suggesting that the ancestors
of Tao aborigines came from Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC CHAIRWOMAN HOPES FOR PASSAGE OF DRAFT AMENDMENTS TO KEY LAW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 2 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman
Tsai Ing-wen said Thursday that she hopes revisions to a key law
governing relations between the people of Taiwan and mainland China
will clear the legislature next week.</P>
      <P>Tsai's remarks came one day after negotiations among legislators
on the draft amendments to seven key laws, including the Statute
Governing the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the
Mainland Area, the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and
Recall Law and the Organic Law of the Judicial Yuan collapsed.</P>
      <P>Attributing the break-up of the negotiations to the lack of
consensus, the MAC chairwoman said she will do her best to assert her
stance in favor of the passage of the amendments in order to gain
support from opponents, mainly lawmakers of the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU).</P>
      <P>Following a discussion of more than an hour with the opponents
after the negotiations broke up Wednesday, Tsai told a conference
later the same day that lawmakers of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) accepted her explanation and agreed to her
plan to maintain the eight-year threshold, which will be imposed in
the future with complementary measures based on control quotas.</P>
      <P>Tsai promised to adopt a quota-based control system in
conjunction with her plan to continue allowing mainland Chinese
spouses of Taiwan residents to receive ID cards after having lived in
Taiwan for eight years -- one of the major disputes in which TSU
lawmakers have demanded prolonging the wait period to 11 years out of
their concern over national security and social order.</P>
      <P>These quotas will be decided in compliance with the government's
demographic policy, she explained, adding that she will continue
negotiations with the TSU legislators to seek their backing on the
issue.</P>
      <P>TSU Chairman Huang Chu-wen claimed that his party insists that
the wait period be prolonged to 11 years and added that the TSU is
also firmly opposed to amendments that would permit mainland-based
colleges to recruit students in Taiwan and allow the opening of
direct cross-strait transport links.</P>
      <P>Earlier Thursday, Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng announced
that legislators had agreed to resume negotiations and screening on
these disputed amendments Oct. 9.</P>
      <P>Chen Chung-hsin, director of the DPP's mainland affairs
department, called for quick passage of the long-awaited law
revisions, especially those to the Statute Governing the Relations
Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, despite
the fact that sharp differences remain in the way.</P>

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
it will not be in Taiwan's interest if mainland China's economy is
developed to pay for military expansion.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in a meeting with Poul Nodgaard, deputy
speaker of Denmark's parliament, who is making his second visit to
Taiwan since 2000 at the head of a pro-Taiwan group of Danish
parliamentarians.</P>
      <P>In addition to expressing gratitude to the parliamentarians for
what they have done for Taiwan, Chen said he also hopes that the
Danish Parliament can pass a resolution demanding that Beijing
dismantle the more than 500 missiles along its southeastern coast
targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Nodgaard and Chen also talked about issues of mutual concern,
including human rights, the impact of mainland China's economic
development on Taiwan, the prevention of the severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) and Taiwan's participation in the World Health
Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>Chen said the impact of SARS on Taiwan would have been less if
the island had been a WHO member and he urged the Danish Parliament
to show its support for Taiwan's WHO bid as did the European
Parliament.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen added that he feels it ironic that due to
pressure from Beijing, Denmark, a democratic country, did not allow
him to receive the 2001 Prize for Freedom of the Liberal
International at a ceremony held in Copenhagen.</P>
      <P>Instead, Chen's wife had to travel to Strasbourg, France, to
receive the award on Chen's behalf.</P>
      <P>Despite the unpleasant past, Chen said, Taiwan and Denmark have
maintained close economic and trade relations, with bilateral trade
reaching US$457 million last year, leaving a trade surplus of US$83
million in Taiwan's favor.</P>
      <P>Chen hailed Denmark's achievements in high technology, design and
biotechnology and expressed the hope that the two countries can have
more exchanges in these areas in the future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OB-GYN CLINICS CLOSING DUE TO DECLINING BIRTH RATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  2  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>About one-third of Taiwan's private
obstetric clinics have been forced to change their service fields or
close altogether because of the ever-declining birth rate, medical
sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lee Mao-sheng, president of the Society of Obstetrics and
Gynecology (SOG) in Taiwan, said the birth rate has been declining by
10 percent annually in recent decades, forcing many ob-gyn clinics to
scale down or suspend operations.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, more than 410,000 babies were born in 1981, but
the number dropped to slightly more than 320,000 in 1991 and plunging
further to about 260,000 in 2001 and 247,000 in 2002. The number of
infants to be born this year is estimated at 210,000.</P>
      <P>Lee said major local associations of obstetricians and
gynecologists have discussed this downward trend many times.
Rising tuition fees and the sluggish economy might be discouraging
people from having babies, Lee said, adding that the SOG
is watching to see whether the trend will continue deteriorating.</P>
      <P>A few years ago, Lee said, Taiwan still had 1,800 private
obstetric clinics. "Nowadays, only about 1,200 of them are still
operating, marking a 33 percent decline, " he said, adding that some
600 professional obstetricians or gynecologists have transferred to
family medicine or other medical fields, or have simply retired.</P>
      <P>To the best of his understanding, Lee said, many clinics now
focus on treating women's diseases or disorders related to the
reproductive system or menopause.</P>
      <P>Of the clinics in the four cities and counties of central Taiwan,
fewer than 15 can deliver more than 10 babies a month, Lee said. With
the number of pregnant women declining, he said, SOG members are
treating only 27 outpatients per day. "Ob-Gyn doctors can hardly make
a living on such a small number of patients," he noted.</P>
      <P>As a result, many local ob-gyn clinics have adopted promotional
strategies to attract customers, including offering gifts to newborns
or free specially prepared meals for new mothers.</P>
      <P>According to government tallies, each Taiwan woman now gives
birth to an average of just 1.3 children. The Ministry of the
Interior has proposed a package of 12 measures to encourage marriage
and birth, with a view to raising the number of children born to each
local woman to 1.6 in 30 years.</P>
      <P>Later this year, the ministry will also come up with a report on
problems that might arise from an aging population and declining
birth rate. Ministry officials said they will push the Cabinet to
offer more incentives or subsidies to encourage childbirth.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A local welfare organization began training
a seeing eye dog Thursday as part of its efforts to enhance the
independence, dignity and self-confidence of Taiwan's blind people.</P>
      <P>The Institute for the Blind of Taiwan said the country's first
internationally licensed seeing eye dog trainer has begun to train an
eight-month-old Labrador from New Zealand.</P>
      <P>The institute was the first Taiwan welfare organization to
introduce specially bred and trained seeing eye dogs to help people
who are blind or visually impaired to travel safely and
independently.</P>
      <P>Since 1993, the institute has imported 10 professionally trained
seeing eye dogs from Japan, Australia and New Zealand. The oldest one
retired earlier this year after 10 years of service.</P>
      <P>Because of significant differences in the general living
environment in Taiwan and the three advanced countries from which the
animals come, the foreign-trained dogs have had difficulty adapting
to life in Taiwan. In some cases, an institute spokesman said, they
are scared by the undisciplined swarms of motorcycles on local
streets, resulting in injuries to their blind masters.</P>
      <P>The institute therefore decided to send local pet training
experts to New Zealand to study advanced seeing eye training skills
and gaining expertise in preparation for training professional guide
dogs in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen Ya-fang is the first to obtain an international license to
enter the guide dog training profession.</P>
      <P>Chen said she has endured many daunting challenges and tests
during her three-and-a-half years of study in New Zealand. "My love
of dogs has helped me overcome all the difficulties and complete my
studies," she said.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Labradors make the best guide dogs as they are
docile and interact well with their masters.</P>
      <P>In advanced countries, Chen said, there is one seeing eye dog for
every 100 blind people. "In terms of this ratio, Taiwan should have
500 guide dogs, as the nation has about 50,000 blind or visually
impaired persons. At the moment, we have only 10 dogs, so we still
have a long way to go," she added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The qualified foreign institutional investor
(QFII) mechanism that has regulated foreign investments in Taiwan's
securities and future market for 13 years was abolished Thursday,
according to Wu Tang-chieh, vice chairman of the Securities and
Futures Commission (SFC).</P>
      <P>Wu said that a foreign investor needs to state in the
registration document whether the nature of the investment is for the
purpose of actual investment or hedging.</P>
      <P>If the investor is not a fund, the declaration shall state that
the investment capital in Taiwan is not, and shall not, be funded
from mainland China or Taiwan and that the investor shall not use
unjust methods to manipulate the financial market.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) announced in July that the foreign
investment regulations would be amended and the QFII registration
replaced by a single registration with the Central Bank and the
Taiwan Stock Exchange (TSE), with no investment quota for new foreign
institutional investors.</P>
      <P>While Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) is expected to
elevate the weightings of the Taiwan index constituents in November,
the SFC has anticipated that the timing for suspending the QFII
mechanism will have some effect on the MSCI decision, according to
Wu.</P>
      <P>Norman Villamin, Asia-Pacific strategist at Morgan Stanley, said
that as the announcement in July has induced a capital flow into
Taiwan's stock market over the past few months and has stimulated
stock prices, the suspension of the QFII mechanism might not have
much impact on Taiwan's stock market.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, some market observers have suggested that
anticipation that the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI)
would elevate the current Limited Investability Factor (LIF) applied
to the MSCI Taiwan Index constituent might induce another US$30
billion to US$35 billion foreign capital into the Taiwan stock
market.</P>
      <P>The MSCI has applied the LIF in Taiwan as an instrument to
reflect market restrictions and obstacles to foreign investment.
At present, the MSCI applies to LIF of 0.55 to the free
float-adjusted market capitalization of all constituents in the MSCI
Taiwan index.</P>
      <P>Statistics released by the MOF indicate that foreign capital
inflows into Taiwan's stock market reached a single-month height in
August, totaling US$4.218 billion. Between January 2000 and Sept. 5,
2003, foreign capital inflows amounted to US$57.324 billion.</P>
      <P>Since the government allowed qualified foreign institutional
investors to invest in Taiwan stocks in 1991, a total of 719 QFIIs
have operated in the Taiwan Stock Exchange, according to MOF
statistics.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OFFICIAL LANGUAGE CHOICE SHOULD TRANSCEND POLITICS: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
the establishment of official languages should be based on the
respect of differences among various ethnic groups and cultures, and
should transcend stereotypes and political ideology.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in an essay on the beauty and diversity of
Taiwan's languages in his electronic newspaper.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that when he was small, he talked with his parents in
Taiwanese and it was not until he entered school that he started to
learn mandarin Chinese. In Junior high school, he studied English and
heard a lot of classmates speaking Hakka and aboriginal languages.</P>
      <P>"Although my wife Wu Shu-chen often laughs at me for speaking
`Taiwanese mandarin,'" the president said, the purpose of talk is to
communicate and although his is not standard usage, the listener can
understand and the purpose of communication is served.</P>
      <P>The president also said that he speaks Hakka and aboriginal
languages now on occasion and even though he is far from fluent, it
helps to "bridge the gap between him and his audiences."</P>
      <P>Chen said that "everyone" knows that the languages spoken in
Taiwan are the result of historical development and social structure,
adding that the Japanese colonists and later the Kuomintang regime
invariably used high-handed methods to impose their languages on the
people, which he said seriously damaged the development of other
cultures.</P>
      <P>Chen said that there are 29 languages spoken in Taiwan,
including Taiwanese, mandarin, Hakka and more than a dozen aboriginal
languages. According to UNESCO statistics, however, there are
only 22 languages left in Taiwan and the other seven have
disappeared.</P>
      <P>Chen said: "We should pay more attention to ensure the continued
passing on of the languages of minor ethnic groups."</P>
      <P>The president also said that the establishment of official
languages should be based on the principles of respect, linguistics,
education and ethnic relations.</P>
      <P>The establishment of official languages should serve as a tool
for communication and that priority should be given to the
convenience of the majority, the president added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  2 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The administrator of the Cabinet-level
Environmental Protection Administration, Hau Lung-bin, who tendered
his resignation Wednesday, said Thursday that he is determined to
quit despite pleas from Premier Yu Shyi-kun.</P>
      <P>Hau made the statement during a visit to an environmental
protection supervisory unit in Taichung, central Taiwan. He said he
went to say goodbye to his colleagues.</P>
      <P>Hau is the only Cabinet member who belongs to an opposition party
-- the New Party. He is also a popular figure among high-ranking
government officials. Hau decided to resign after his suggestion that
environmental issues should not be subject to a vote in referendums
was not accepted by Premier Yu, who maintained that the views of
experts should not prevail over democracy.</P>
      <P>Hau made his suggestion after residents of Pinglin, a rural
township in Taipei County, held a non-binding referendum last month
to urge the central government to open a ramp linking the town to a
freeway, despite a decision made by Hau's specialists on the issue
that such a move would damage the environment of Pinglin, located
near a catchment for a reservoir that supplies drinking water to the
metropolitan Taipei area.</P>
      <P>Hau said he was afraid that accepting these sorts of referendums
would trigger a domino effect in other areas of Taiwan that would
seriously damage the island's environment.</P>
      <P>Not to Hau's surprise, several non-binding referendums are
planned for other townships around the island, with the subjects
focusing on whether the residents should have an incinerator or
crematorium in the area.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, Hau encouraged his colleagues to continue their
fight for the protection of the environment of the island.</P>
      <P>Stressing that he will not be involved in political affairs in
the short term, Hau said he may serve as a volunteer worker in the
future for the welfare of the country.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Democratic Progressive Party government is still
trying to convince Hau to stay, with Premier Yu going to Hau's
residence Thursday to make one final attempt to dissuade Hau from
stepping down.</P>
      <P>Hau, who assumed his post in March 2001, grabbed the spotlight by
his successful implementation of a policy limiting the use of plastic
bags around the island.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian promised Thursday
that his administration will not phase out vocational high schools,
saying that students should have a wider range of options in Taiwan's
diversified and pluralistic society.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at the opening of a two-day national

vocational high schools across Taiwan together.</P>
      <P>In an effort to allay their concern over the issue, Chen said
vocational high schools are not affiliated with normal high schools
and stressed that the government in turn will devote more energy and
resources to develop vocational education facilities instead of
abolishing them.</P>
      <P>The government should build a good environment in which Taiwan's
children and youth should be provided with more options and channels
to develop their interests, potential and dispositions, the president
said, expressing the hope that the current meeting will help create
more favorable conditions for the normal development of elementary
school and junior high school education.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's education environment must be more flexible and
multitudinous, and a sound and high-quality vocational high school

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
expressed the hope Thursday that Bosnia would respect the new version
of Republic of China passports as effective travel documents for the
people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Richard Shih made the remarks after reports from
travel agents said the East European country had refused to issue
visas to Taiwan citizens holding the new version of the passport.</P>
      <P>Chu Chien-sung, deputy director of MOFA's Department of European
Affairs, said that the ministry is checking on the matter through
appropriate channels.</P>
      <P>Chu said that the ministry was surprised when travel agents
alerted them to the matter, since Taiwan tourists seldom travel to
Bosnia, and the government has no missions stationed there.</P>
      <P>The ministry further learned that a particular travel agent had
applied for visas through the Bosnia embassy in Slovenia. As the ROC
government also has no missions stationed in Slovenia, it has to
check on the matter through other channels.</P>
      <P>Chu said the ministry is trying to learn whether the rejection
was because of the new version of the passport or because of the
Taiwan tourists themselves.</P>
      <P>But Chu said that before the launch of the new version of the
passport last month, the ministry had asked all missions overseas to
communicate with governments of their hosting countries, and Bosnia
falls under the jurisdiction of Taipei's representative office in
Hungary.</P>
      <P>Chu noted that Rock Leng, ROC representative to Hungary, has
notified the Bosnian embassy in Hungary about the new version of the
passport, and did not receive an unfavorable response.</P>
      <P>The MOFA launched the new version of passport Sept. 1, with the
word "Taiwan" in capitalized Roman script added to the official name
of the Republic of China to the cover.</P>
      <P>The MOFA said the new ROC passport will make it more
distinguishable from the one issued by the People's Republic of China
(PRC) -- mainland China's official name.</P>

survey released Thursday saying that they like Japanese pop culture
most.</P>
      <P>Twenty-three percent of Taipei youths said they like European and
American pop culture, followed by local pop culture at 19 percent.</P>
      <P>Though Korean TV series's are popular in Taiwan, only 6 percent
of the youths polled said they like Korean pop culture.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by the Taipei Youth Activity Center under
the Taipei City Government, investigated the current developments and
trends on four aspects -- the Internet, music and dance, dress, and
idols.</P>
      <P>The results showed that youths look most to the Internet for pop
culture information, or 58 percent, followed by music and dance
performance (42 percent), dress and info on idols accounted for 37
percent and 33 percent respectively.</P>
      <P>Tchen Yu-chiou, chairwoman of the Council for Cultural Affairs,

and chat with others; 44 percent said they use the Net for homework.</P>

result in relationship alienation, with the youths only concerned
about their own enjoyment without any enthusiasm for the outside
world.</P>
      <P>On which music and dance will best represent the chic culture of
the youths, 46 percent cited hip-hop; 26 percent said performance by
entertainers.</P>
      <P>Fifty-four percent of the youths polled said that their parents
don't understand the chic culture, but 82 percent also said that the
pursuit of pop culture has not created a confrontation with their
parents.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted between Sept. 19-24 on youths between 15
and 18 in the greater Taipei area. A total of 1,003 effective samples
were collected, with a margin of error of 3.16 percent.</P>

    <TEXT>The New York Times: Officials Say Bush Seeks
$600 Million to Hunt Iraq Arms.

The Bush administration is seeking more than $600 million from Congress
to continue the hunt for conclusive evidence that Saddam Hussein's
government had an illegal weapons program, officials said Wednesday.
The money comes on top of at least $300 million that has already been
spent on the weapons search, officials said.

The Wall Stree Journal: Filtering Process: Longer Dialysis Raises
Hopes, but Poses Dilemma. Who Gets Costly Treatment? Personality,
Persistence and Housekeeping Count.

In 2001, New York's Rogosin Institute was about to start an unusual new
program for dialysis patients. It would give them a blood-cleansing
machine to use at home for six nights a week, eight hours each night.
The "intensive" treatment had shown excellent results elsewhere. But
because both Medicare and private insurers wouldn't pay for it, the
nonprofit dialysis center could only afford to make it available to a
handful of patients.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>PAN-PURPLE ALLIANCE URGES LAWMAKERS TO FOCUS ON LEGISLATIVE WORK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Alliance of Fairness and Justice issued
an open letter to the ruling and opposition parties Thursday urging
them to focus on legislative work in order to craft a comprehensive
social security net.</P>
      <P>The alliance, also known as the pan-purple alliance, said the
opposition parties should not drag their feet while advising the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to refrain from adopting
radical, extremist strategies or spurring a meaningless debate on
whether Taiwan should declare independence or unify with mainland
China.</P>
      <P>"We hope both the ruling and opposition parties will push their
lawmakers to devote their full energies to legislative work, " Chien
Hsi-chieh, the alliance's convener, said at a news conference.</P>
      <P>If the ruling and opposition parties fail to respond to the
alliance's appeal, Chien said, the alliance will launch a campaign
against those parties or individual politicians during next year's
legislative election.</P>
      <P>According to Chien, the alliance has sent duplicate copies of the
letter to Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, Premier Yu
Shyi-kun as well as the headquarters and legislative caucuses of the
ruling and opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Chien said the alliance has outlined a series of priorities in
its letter. "We hope the Legislative Yuan can complete law revisions
or new legislation in four areas during its current session to
strengthen social security benefits and eliminate unfairness and
injustices in our current taxation system," he explained.</P>
      <P>The four areas of legislation singled out by the alliance include
those related to overhauling the taxation system, introducing a
national pension system, bettering the healthcare system, and
establishing an immigration administration and revising immigration
regulations.</P>
      <P>Chien said the alliance looks forward to seeing a quick passage
of amendments to immigration rules to give full civil rights to
mainland Chinese spouses of local citizens equal to those offered to
spouses from other countries.</P>
      <P>The pan-purple alliance is composed of nine major local social
welfare groups that promote fair and just welfare services and speak
for the underprivileged.</P>

      <P>Mainland China could present a trade

States by Premier Wen Jiabao towards the end of the year, the Far
Eastern Economic Review has reported.</P>
      <P>In its latest issue published Thursday, the magazine quoted a

U.S. concerns about whether mainland China is implementing
market-opening and other pledges it made on joining the World Trade

      <P>U.S. officials, the report said, also hope that Beijing will make
some gesture to lower its trade surplus with the United States when
U.S. Commerce Secretary Don Evans visits Beijing later this month,
such as purchasing more passenger jets from Boeing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STUDENT SMOKING A SERIOUS PROBLEM AT TAIPEI SCHOOLS: CITY COUNCILOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taipei city councilman on Friday called
attention to the serious problem of junior and senior high school
student smoking and urged the city government to adopt necessary
measures to deal with the problem.</P>
      <P>Taipei Councilor Wang Shih-chien of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party pointed out that school authorities have caught
more than 6,500 students smoking over the past 30 months.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that even more shocking is the fact that elementary
school students down to Grade 4 have been caught smoking.</P>
      <P>Noting that there are currently more than 234,600 students at
Taipei junior and senior high schools, Wang said that on average,
there are over seven students under the age of 18 discovered smoking
on school grounds each day.</P>
      <P>"This figure could very well be just the tip of the iceberg, "
Wang pointed out. He said that judging from the fact that schools
have not reported all cases of students caught smoking and that many
students may be smoking off school grounds after having been caught
doing so on campus, the actual figure could be more staggering.</P>
      <P>Wang asked the Education Department of Taipei City Government to
work out feasible measures within two months to solve the problem. He
also asked that the total ban on smoking on campus be rigorously
enforced to prevent students from imitating teachers that smoke.</P>
      <P>He said that between the start of 2001 and June 2003, nearly 70
percent of the 127 public and private schools in Taipei had reported
students smoking alone or with their fellow classmates in restrooms,
stadiums or other sites on school grounds.</P>
      <P>He also noted that more than 90 percent of the students who smoke
get their cigarettes from convenience stores, grocery stores, or even
betel nut vendors, and that only a few get their cigarettes from
their friends or from home.</P>
      <P>Noting that only a total of NT$470,000 (US$13,905) in fines have
been issued to only 157 shops over the past 30 months for selling
cigarettes to youths under 18, Wang lashed out at the relevant
government agencies for failing to rigorously enforce the tobacco
control law.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER FORECASTS GROWTH OF 3.8 PERCENT FOR 2004</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun forecast Friday that
Taiwan's economy will grow by 3.8 percent for 2004 in his report at
the Legislative Yuan on the government's 2004 general budget plan.</P>
      <P>Briefing the Legislature, Yu said growth of 3.8 percent for next
year is likely in view of the expanded public investment projects,
both in scale and scope, at home, and the steady recovery of
economies worldwide.</P>
      <P>According to the budget plan already presented to the
Legislature, the government's total outlay will be NT$1.61 trillion
(US$48.07 billion) for 2004, representing an increase of NT$61
billion over that for 2003.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, total government revenue for next year has been
estimated at NT$1.35 trillion, which means there will be a shortfall
of NT$257.4 billion that will have to be raised through borrowing,
according to the budget plan.</P>
      <P>Yu said the NT$1.6l trillion outlay is primarily designed for the
financing of public investment projects which are part of the 2008
National Development Plan. Of the total outlay, NT$78.4 billion has
been allocated exclusively to science and technology development,
marking an increase of 11.3 percent over the level for 2003, he
noted.</P>
      <P>Other major expenditures listed in the budget are for education,
at NT$200.9 billion, defense and weaponry systems procurement, and
subsidies to senior citizens and farmers, according to Yu.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The next big challenge for Singapore's
education system is to turn out young people geared to succeed in a
changing work environment, employers have told Acting Education
Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam.</P>
      <P>Shanmugaratnam, delivering his first major speech on education
Thursday, polled several employers and industry leaders for a sense
of the challenges facing schools in Singapore.</P>
      <P>Employers told him that straight As alone are no guarantee of
career success. They said they want employees who speak well, think
on their feet, ask good questions, and have stretched themselves
through co-curricular activities (CCA) or community work.</P>
      <P>Speaking to about 1,200 school principals, teachers and education
specialists at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Shanmugaratnam said that there
are important gaps to be plugged but that there is no need to
overhaul the system.</P>
      <P>According to the employers, Singaporean students emerge from the
rigorous, competitive system with top grades, but still lack critical
skills that are valued in the workplace. The system needs to produce
people who have more than outstanding academic results, they added.</P>

      <P>Contrary to a newspaper report, there is no
sign that the mainland Chinese military is planing to conduct
exercises in the southern province of Fujian, according to the
Ministry of National Defense Friday.</P>
      <P>In spite of a story published in Friday's Straits Times in

      <P>The Straits Times said Beijing will stage a rapid-strike military
exercise on Oct. 10, the Republic of China's National Day, in an
attempt to jangle the nerves of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The paper said the exercise is meant as a show of Beijing's anger
over Taiwan leader Chen Shui-bian's recently revealed plan to write a
new constitution.</P>
      <P>Beijing's Xinhua news agency, however, reported from Hong Kong

      <P>Modernizing Taiwan's outdated education
system will not be easy, but the government must not shy away from
its responsibilities simply because of the challenge, President Chen
Shui-bian said Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking to a group of students who had won awards in various
international academic competitions, the president affirmed his
commitment to the 10-year-old education reforms, which have
encountered strong opposition because of the problems in making
substantial changes.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan's education system used to be a tool of the
rulers who used it to turn out loyal followers. Although it produced
some worthy persons in the past, the system has dampened -- even
smothered -- students' creativity and blunted the country's

an education system which is more open, more liberal, and more likely
to meet the needs of society, the president said.</P>
      <P>"The process of transformation is not trouble-free, but we can't
retreat and give up our efforts to attain our goals because of the
difficulty of the tasks," Chen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESS CREDIT GUARANTEE FUND TO BE INCREASED: CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Sept. 3 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian announced Friday
that the government will donate an additional NT$50 billion (US$1.38
billion) to the Small and Medium Business Credit Guarantee Fund
(SMBCGF) over the next five years.</P>
      <P>Addressing the award presentation ceremony of the 12th National
Awards of Small and Medium Enterprises and the fifth National Awards
of Overseas Taiwanese Businesses, Chen said that small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) form the main force in creating the
so-called Taiwan economic miracle. They account for 97.72 percent of
Taiwan enterprises in terms of numbers and offer 78 percent of the
country's job opportunities, he explained.</P>
      <P>The government will donate NT$10 billion each year in the next
five years to the SMBCGF to increase the capital supply for SMEs and
to further consolidate their development, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Chen encouraged the SMEs to join government efforts in improving
the country's economy. More than one year after the government
launched its six-year national development plan, "Challenge 2008," he
said, more than 10 multinational enterprises have decided to
establish their research and development centers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It is expected that some 250 Taiwan businesses will set up their
operational hubs in Taiwan by the end of this year, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Founded in 1974 with donations from central and local
governments, contracted financial institutions and other agencies,
the SMBCGF provides credit guarantees to SMEs which are promising but
short of collateral necessary to obtain financing from contracted
financial institutions. The amount of the fund's net worth was
NT$13.049 billion at the end of last year.</P>

      <P>The vice chairman of the Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) denied reports Friday that mainland
China's Peking University and Taiwan's National Chengchi University
will each recognize academic credits awarded by the other.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-tong pointed out that the government at present allows
Taiwan universities to open classes on the mainland, but only
recognizes the credits awarded if the teachers and the students are
from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said that this is tantamount merely to using mainland
facilities as classrooms, which he said is different from recognizing
credits awarded by the universities on each side of the Taiwan

      <P>Referring to the reports, Chen said: "These are only media

      <P>He said that according to the regulations governing cultural and

students can study here, although Taiwan does not give them any

credits even if Taiwan were to award them, "would be their business,"

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN FISHING BOAT CAPTAIN RETURNS FROM DETENTION IN PHILIPPINES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The captain of a Taiwan fishing boat
detained by the Philippines for 18 months returned to Taiwan Friday.</P>
      <P>Upon arrival at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, Huang
Chi-huang, captain of the Pingtung-registered Man Chi Tsai No. 2,
headed straight for Tungkang in Pingtung County to be reunited with
his wife and four children, whom he had not seen for more than 500
days.</P>
      <P>On the way to Tungkang, Huang said that on April 15, 2002, he
sailed to the Philippines to pick up a Filipino crew to fish for
black tuna in the Pacific, but was detained by the Philippine
authorities when he was navigating through Philippines' waters.</P>
      <P>Huang dismissed as "rubbish" reports that he was poaching in the
Philippines' waters.</P>
      <P>He expressed his gratitude toward all those who had assisted him
over the past 18 months in securing his release, especially the
Republic of China mission in Manila.</P>
      <P>Huang said that one Taiwanese and three mainland Chinese crewmen
were detained along with him, but the Taiwanese and two of the
mainlanders were able to escape after they boarded another detained
Taiwanese ship that was swept out of Abali Port in northern Luzon
Province during a typhoon earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Huang said that he will try to secure the release of the
remaining mainland Chinese fisherman and added that Captain Hung
Hsin-san and Chief Engineer Peng Fei-lung of another Taiwan fishing
ship, Chin Sheng Ta, are still detained in the Philippines and
awaiting their chance to return to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Earlier in Manila, the ROC representative to the Philippines saw
Huang off at the airport.</P>
      <P>Wu Hsin-hsing, director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in the Philippines, said that from the experiences of Huang
and other detained fishermen, it is evident that the lives, property
and human rights of Taiwan fishermen must be ensured.</P>
      <P>Wu said that his office will do everything possible to promote
fishery cooperation between Taiwan and the Philippines, and will seek
to find a lasting solution to fishery disputes between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>Many Pingtung fishing boats have cooperated with the private
Philippine fishing sector through brokerage house to allow them to
operate in waters overlapping the economic zones of Taiwan and the
Philippines. Should a Taiwanese vessel be detained by the Philippine
authorities, the Taiwan shipowner and the brokerage house should each
pay half the fine for the ship's release. Those who do not join the
cooperative project have to pay the fines on their own.</P>
      <P>The period from mid-April through mid-July is a peak season for
black tuna, whose firm, meaty flesh is a costly delicacy. During the
season, hundreds of Taiwan fishing vessels, mostly from Pingtung and
Kaohsiung, operate in fishing grounds that overlap the economic zones
of Taiwan and the Philippines near the Bashi Channel and the
Philippine Sea to catch black tuna.</P>
      <P>Philippine fishery authorities began to pay close attention to
Taiwan fishing boats in 2002 after some Pingtung fishermen made a
fortune from black tuna sales the previous year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Yu Cheng-hsien was
reprimanded by Premier Yu Shyi-kun Thursday for hiring two masseuses
at the expense of a business friend, but will not receive any further
punishment, Executive Yuan spokesman Lin Chia-lung said Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin said an investigation by the Executive Yuan found that Yu did
not behave appropriately in receiving a massage from the two women,
who are not blind and are therefore unlicensed masseuses. However,
the investigation determined that the massage did not count as
asexual service and the minister did not return the favor from his
business friend, so the premier decided not to punish him other than
by warning him to mend his ways. There is no question that he will be
asked to resign, Lin added.</P>
      <P>The spokesman quoted the premier as telling Yu Cheng-hsien that
public officials are government workers and should be held to higher
standards of behavior than members of the public.</P>
      <P>The incident was reported by a local newspaper and triggered an
uproar in political circles, as local massage parlors are often
thinly veiled fronts for the sex industry.</P>
      <P>Yu apologized for accepting the massage, but claimed not to know
that massage is a profession reserved for the blind.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The economies of mainland China, Taiwan,
Hong Kong and Singapore have been the ones most affected by the
outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), according to a
report by the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The 2003 trade and development report released by the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said that
mainland China's first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) was
stagnate, while the Q1 GDP growth of Taiwan and Hong Kong fell
noticeably. Singapore's Q1 GDP growth was even in red, according to
the report.</P>
      <P>SARS might have a greater economic impact in the second quarter
on these badly affected areas, with their transportation and tourism
industries suffering bigger losses, in addition to the foreign trade
sector, the report said.</P>
      <P>The transportation and tourism industries in these countries and
areas account for 10 percent of their GDP, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Citing an assessment by the Asian Development Bank, the report
said the negative effects of SARS on these East Asian economies' Q2
GDP growth could drop to a range between 0.2 percent and 2 percent,
affecting Hong Kong and Singapore the most and mainland China and
South Korea the least, at a time when the epidemic had been
effectively contained.</P>
      <P>The report claimed that SARS might bring down the GDP by 0.5
percent for the whole region in 2003 and it estimated that Taiwan
will post 3.2 percent economic growth for the whole of this year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the UNCTAD listed Taiwan and South Korea as
first-grade newly industrialized economies (NIEs) , or
industrializers, in the report because of their successful advances
into the hi-tech field under the model set up by developed countries.</P>

      <P>The county magistrate of the Republic of
China-controlled island of Kinmen called Friday for attention to be
paid to mainland Chinese vegetables and fruit that he said might have
been polluted with excessive amounts of pesticide.</P>
      <P>Lee Chu-feng said that since the opening of the "mini three
links, " large amounts of mainland-originating vegetables and fruit
have found their way to Kinmen, mainly through the illegal "beach
trade."</P>
      <P>However, Lee claimed that most of the mainland produce that
arrives in Kinmen via the "beach trade" is found by customs and
health authorities to contain excessive amounts of agricultural
chemicals.</P>
      <P>Lee said consumption of the polluted produce on a long term basis
would be harmful to the health of Kinmen residents.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee also called for Kinmen farmers to refrain from
using excessive amounts of pesticide on their farms.</P>
      <P>Citing his own personal experiences as an example, Lee said that
when he was a child, he used to see many palang turtle and huashen
fish -- common endemic species in Kinmen -- which are found no
longer, most likely as a result of excessive use of pesticide.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks during a workshop on the safe use of
agricultural chemicals sponsored by the Kinmen county government,

    <HEADLINE>TSU TO PROPOSE REGULATION OF FORMER MILITARY, SECURITY PERSONNEL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
said Friday that it will propose an amendment to suspend pension
payments to former military and security personnel who violate
regulations that prohibit them from traveling to mainland China
without permission.</P>
      <P>The TSU legislative caucus expressed the views after listening to
a report delivered by the National Security Bureau (NSB).</P>
      <P>TSU legislators were very upset that Pan Hsi-hsien -- a former
head of the NSB's personnel department who went to work at a friend's
factory in Shenzhen, mainland China, three days after his retirement
in June 2000 -- is still claiming his pension through his wife and
that more than 100 retired army generals have settled on the
mainland.</P>
      <P>NSB Vice Director Huang Lei reported that Pan has been detained
by the mainland security authorities and has been forbidden to leave
the mainland.</P>
      <P>Another NSB official, former Chief Accountant Liu Kuan-chun, is
still at large after embezzling more than NT$192 million (US$5.68
million) and sneaking out of Taiwan in September 2000, Huang
reported.</P>
      <P>Liao Ben-yan, TSU caucus whip, said that according to Huang's
report, the government has no way to regulate retired military and
security officials who travel to the mainland. He added that Pan's
continued claiming of his pension is "incredible."</P>
      <P>He said that many retired generals have not followed the
regulations that state that if their work involved national security,
they should obtain approval from the Ministry of the Interior and
other related government agencies if they want to travel to the
mainland within three years of their retirement.</P>
      <P>He said regulations for former military and security officials
should be more strict and that those who ignore the regulations
should be severely punished.</P>
      <P>TSU Legislator Lo Jhih-ming said that based on a calculation of
more than 100 retired generals traveling to the mainland, the money
Taiwan remits each year to the mainland in pensions amounts to more
than NT$1 billion.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lo said, those people might reveal national secrets
or expose intelligence networks.</P>
      <P>The TSU will motion an amendment to a revised draft of the
Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area
and the Mainland Area next week to regulate retired military and
security officials.</P>
      <P>If they are found to have violated the regulations by traveling
to the mainland, they should be fined, sentenced to two years of
imprisonment and have their pensions suspended, Lo said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO INFLUENCE PEDDLING INVOLVED IN TAIPEI BANK-FUBON MERGER: MA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that
he guaranteed with his personal reputation that there was no
influence peddling nor "insiders' deal" involved in the merger of the
private Fubon Holding Co. and the city-run Taipei Bank.</P>
      <P>He vowed to step down from his post as mayor if he were found to
have been involved in interest-peddling or collusion with the Fubon
Group as claimed by some ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
city councilors.</P>
      <P>Ma said he has felt "depressed and stressed" over the accusations
that the DPP councilors have made against him over the past two days.</P>
      <P>He said he had visited Fubon's private club several times, but
that these visits all occurred after the merger deal was completed.
He said he went there primarily to socialize with the Fubon Group
members in the hopes that the "daughter" Taipei Bank would fare well
after its "marriage."</P>
      <P>Denying accusations that he had visited Fubon's private club
seven times, Ma said he only went there three times, with one visit
being hosted by an investment and securities firm while the Fubon
executives were also present.</P>
      <P>He said he had met with Fubon executives for a fourth and fifth
time for casual talks, but that neither of these meetings were at the
Fubon club.</P>
      <P>Ma offered his apology for the confusion caused by the city
government not initially releasing accurate information regarding how
many times he had met the Fubon people.</P>
      <P>"I have also directed all city government employees, including
myself, to stop going to private companies' clubs in the future for
business socializing purposes," he said.</P>
      <P>Ma pointed out Friday, however, that it is unfair to accuse the
Taipei City Government of committing collusion simply because its
personnel met with private business groups. "This runs counter to the
spirit of the development of a modern society," he added.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Saturday he
hopes to pick a thoughtful, capable and experienced person to head
the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA).</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks while attending the inauguration of a new
highway linking the northeastern city of Ilan to other parts of
Taiwan a day after he accepted the resignation of EPA Administrator
Hau Lung-pin.</P>
      <P>Praising Hau as an outstanding EPA chief, Yu said he wants to
name an equally qualified person to assume the post left vacant by
Hau.</P>
      <P>Yu also outlined the terms for selecting Hau's successor. "The
new environmental chief must have contributed to Taiwan's
environmental protection drive in the past years and have experience,
ideas and the capability to implement the government's environmental
protection policies and all relevant projects, " he explained, adding
that it may take a few more days for him to select a suitable
replacement.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, Legislator Chao Yung-ching of the
Democratic Progressive Party is a likely candidate for the top EPA
post. But Chao, who has been active in promoting environmental
protection programs in recent years, said nobody has talked about he
issue with him.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yu said the Peiyi Expressway, which will link Ilan to
metropolitan Taipei, will be completed by the end of 2005 as
scheduled.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Peiyi project's most challenging section -- the
Shueishan (Mount Snow) tunnel -- is now 80 percent complete, Yu said
he is confident that construction of the remaining part of the
expressway will proceed smoothly. When the new expressway opens to
traffic, it will take only 40 minutes to travel from Ilan to Taipei.</P>

      <P>Singapore Airlines (SIA) says that by
Nov. 1all its planes will have surveillance cameras installed to
allow the pilot to view the cabin area just outside the cockpit.</P>
      <P>This is just one of the stepped up security measures which the
airline has undertaken.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a media briefing on Friday, SIA spokesperson Rick

on baggage and improved plane surveillance on the ground.</P>
      <P>Since April 1, all SIA planes have had bullet-proof reinforced

    <DATELINE>Singapore, Oct.4 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Singapore government has set up a
committee to allocate the country's air traffic rights among local
carriers.</P>
      <P>Singapore has taken a major step to pave the way for the
potential entry of new carriers like the proposed budget airlines
ValuAir.</P>
      <P>Singapore has an air services agreement with over 90 countries,
and so far, all air traffic rights are used only by its national
carrier -- Singapore Airlines (SIA).</P>
      <P>But with potential new local carriers taking to the skies next
year, that won't be the case anymore.</P>
      <P>SIA will be able to keep its existing air traffic rights for 10
years, before it has to renew them for up to five years.</P>
      <P>New carriers won't be at a disadvantage when competing with SIA
for air traffic rights.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Transport says there are ample rights for the new
carriers to countries like Australia, Hong Kong, and Thailand.</P>
      <P>To apply for the rights, airlines will first need to obtain a
valid Air Operators Certificate, fulfill the conditions under the Air
Services Agreement and must have sufficient financial resources.</P>
      <P>If there are competing requests, the airlines will be judged
according to how their services can contribute to Singapore's air hub
and consumer benefits.</P>
      <P>All new rights are valid for a maximum of five years.</P>
      <P>If any right isn't used for more than six months, it will be
suspended. SIA isn't exempted on this.</P>
      <P>The fee for each city is SIN$2,000 (US$1,142) a year.</P>
      <P>But in light of the weak global aviation industry, these charges
will be waived till the end of next year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CALL FOR NEW CONSTITUTION AIMED AT MAKING TAIWAN GREAT COUNTRY: CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 4 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday
promoting introduction of a new constitution is a necessary step to
build Taiwan into a normal, complete and great country.</P>
      <P>Addressing a meeting of Taiwanese Christians, Chen said his
appeal to introduce a new constitution for Taiwan in 2006 is by no
means "boring" campaign rhetoric as claimed by opposition parties.</P>
      <P>"The call touches on an important topic worthy of study and
discussion," Chen said, adding that he hopes that the call
can spur a process of constitutional reform to craft a
political framework that would fit Taiwan's realities and deepen its
democratic system.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, former President Lee Teng-hui
seconded Chen's view, saying that his efforts to push for a
"Call Taiwan, Taiwan" movement is aimed at reminding local people to
make Taiwan a normal country through legislating a new
constitution.</P>
      <P>More than 3,000 Taiwanese Christian followers, including those
residing abroad, attended the conference at the Taipei International
Convention Center. They joined Chen and Lee in praying for Taiwan's
well-being during the conference.</P>
      <P>Chen brought up the idea of introducing a new constitution for
Taiwan for the first time at a rally last Sunday marking the
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) 17th founding anniversary in his
capacity as the ruling party's chairman. He said that in 2006, when
the DPP turns 20 years old, he hopes all of the 23 million people of
Taiwan will push for a new constitution.

    <HEADLINE>CHICHI TOWNSHIP RESIDENTS VOTE AGAINST INCINERATOR CONSTRUCTION PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Nantou,  Taiwan, Oct. 4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Residents in Nantou County's Chichi
township in central Taiwan overwhelmingly voted Saturday against
construction of a garbage incinerator in their neighborhood.</P>
      <P>The mountainous township has 9,419 eligible voters and 68 percent
of them, including many senior citizens, turned out to vote.</P>
      <P>With firecrackers exploding in the background, Chichi township
Chief Lee Chung-ching said 97.88 percent of those who voted in his
town rejected the incinerator in a non-binding referendum. He said he
would relay the results to the Nantou County Government. As the
nation has not yet enacted a referendum law, the Chichi vote was
consultative in nature. But Lee said he hopes the county government
and the central government should not ignore Chichi residents'
mainstream opinions.</P>
      <P>Some residents said they may travel to Taipei to file an appeal if
the county government disregards the referendum result and goes ahead
with the project.</P>
      <P>Nantou County Magistrate Lin Chung-nan said he respects the
result of the Chichi referendum, but he added that the plan to build
an incinerator in the mountainous township will be carried out as
scheduled.</P>
      <P>Lin said the county government has passed an environmental impact
assessment on the proposed incinerator construction site and will
hold an open tender before the end of this month to pick a qualified
contractor.</P>
      <P>Lin said prospective bidders must present detailed water and soil
conservation plans. "The county government will closely monitor the
proceedings to allay public misgivings about the incinerator's
possible adverse impact on the environment and water resources, " he
added.</P>
      <P>Nantou is Taiwan's only county that doesn't border seas and 80
percent of its area is slopelands or valleys. "It's no easy task to
select a piece of land to accommodate an incinerator, " Lin said,
adding that more than half of the county's 13 townships and villages
have been plagued by garbage issues.</P>
      <P>If the new incinerator, which will be able to handle 500 tons of
garbage a day, cannot be built as scheduled, Lin said, Chichi
township and its nearby areas will be faced with serious garbage
disposal problems.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Cabinet-level Environmental Protection
Administration said its respect for the Nantou County Government's
environmental impact evaluation will not be affected by the
nonbinding Chichi referendum results.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW EPA HEAD TO BE DECIDED NEXT WEEK AT EARLIEST: SPOKESMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will decide on who to replace
Hau Lung-bin, administrator of the Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA), next week at the earliest, a spokesman of the
Executive Yuan said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Spokesman Lin Chia-lung also said that Premier Yu Shyi-kun is
"still making an overall assessment, " and has yet to begun the
inquiry process for possible candidates.</P>
      <P>"Professionalism, personal image and substantial working
experience" will be the major considerations for the future head of
the EPA, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Liu Shih-fang, secretary-general of the Executive Yuan, and Yeh
Chun-jung, minister without portfolio, have been tipped to be the two
top choices to succeed Hau, but there are also reports that the
premier relies greatly on them in their present capacities and is
unwilling to let them move to other posts.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the reports are "only speculations," as the premier
has yet to begin the process of narrowing down or ruling out any
possible candidates.</P>
      <P>Lin said that DPP Legislator Jao Yung-ching, who was recommended
by ruling Democratic Progressive Party lawmakers, is a very qualified
candidate for his long-term concern for various environmental issues.</P>
      <P>He said the premier will definitely include Jao for
consideration, although he will need some time to make a final
decision.</P>
      <P>The premier accepted the resignation of Hau Friday night after
last-ditch efforts failed to persuade him to change his mind, and EPA
Vice Administrator Chang Juu-en is now acting on Hau's behalf, whose
resignation will take effect Oct. 6.</P>
      <P>Hau tendered his resignation on Wednesday because he didn't see
eye to eye with the premier on referendum issues.</P>
      <P>Hau said the premier rejected his suggestion to exclude
environment related issues which had already passed environmental
impact assessments from issues which could be put to a referendum.</P>
      <P>Hau, a scholar-turn-legislator, was recruited by former Premier
Chang Chun-hsiung to take the helm of the EPA in March 2001 and has
become one of the most popular Cabinet members.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN NEEDS TO DEVELOP KNOWLEDGE-BASED ECONOMY: THINK TANK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan needs to develop a knowledge-based
economy so that it is not easily outpaced in global economic
competition, the head of a local think tank said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen Po-chih, chairman of Taiwan Thinktank, made the remarks at a
seminar sponsored by the Taiwan Economic Association on the effects
of cross-strait trade on the development of Taiwan's economy and
industrial structure.</P>
      <P>Chen said that because of increased cross-Taiwan Strait trade and
investment, Taiwan's wages and prices have drifted down towards the
level of that of mainland China, adding that the effect is especially
evident in the labor wages of the manufacturing sector.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan needs to develop a knowledge-based economy which mainland
China could not match, and reverse the adverse situation, " Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that Taiwan and other three Asian dragons, meaning
Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea, were able to achieve rapid
economic growth and enjoy prosperity in the 1980s because then the
world economy and its main international trade were made up of
high-income countries and a few small countries in Asia.</P>
      <P>But then Vietnam, India and other East Asian countries joined the
same development pattern. Using only one-tenth the wages offered by
the four Asian dragons, they took away business and then labor wages
in the manufacturing sectors of the four dragons began to drift
downwards.</P>
      <P>Chen said that as the drifting lower of labor wages is
inevitable, if Taiwan wants to maintain its high income, it will have
to develop non-trade properties, such as service, a more ideal living
environment, and hardware and software facilities, he added.</P>

      <P>The number of railway accidents in
Taiwan has reduced substantially in recent years after the

at railway crossings reduced from 129 in 1998 and 116 in 1999 to
77 in 2001 and 82 in 2002. The TRA spent NT$400 million (US$11.85
million) for the installation of the emergency warning device.</P>
      <P>He said railway accidents could be further reduced in Taiwan,
because the TRA has asked the Taipei-based China Traffic Signal

dangerous conditions along the railroad and at railway crossings. The
monitoring system could provide video information to alert locomotive
drivers to dangerous conditions in ample time to avoid accidents.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN INVESTMENT ENVIRONMENT REMAINS ATTRACTIVE: BUSINESS LEADERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  5 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's investment environment remains
attractive, a group of business leaders said Sunday at a symposium.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the symposium titled "Invest in Taiwan, Access the
World" sponsored by the Executive Yuan, Leslie Lok, president of
Siemens Ltd. Taiwan, said that Taiwan has a free, convenient,
comfortable and beautiful living environment that is attractive to
the talented individuals who are the core value of an enterprise's
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of a survey carried out among his company's
employees as example, he said that 87 percent of the respondents
would choose to stay in Taiwan given the option of working in Taiwan,
Mainland China, Hong Kong or Malaysia.</P>
      <P>Lok said his company is expected to have an annual revenue of
946.9 million euros (US$1.106 billion) this year, enjoying a growth
rate of 110 percent over that of five years ago, when it registered
450 million euros.</P>
      <P>The figures show that Taiwan remains a place worthwhile to do
business, he said.</P>
      <P>For his part, Y.T. Du, chairman of Citigroup Global Markets
Taiwan Ltd., said that Taiwan is more attractive to international
capital markets every day and that international capital inflow to
the country is increasing.</P>
      <P>Foreign capital accounted for more than 22 percent of the total
value of stocks listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange at the end of
September, up from 16 percent registered in May 2000, Du noted.</P>
      <P>Based on the fact that the total value of stocks listed on
Taiwan's bourse increased from between NT$8 trillion and NT$9
trillion to NT$11.1 trillion during the period between 2000 and
September 2003, foreign capital in Taiwan has increased by 60 percent
in less than three years, he went on.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, he went on, Taiwan's enterprises had lured a total
of US$11.1 billion-worth of foreign capital through issuing deposit
receipts or bonds overseas as of the end of September, up 60 percent
on a year-to-year basis. The capital channeled into Taiwan using
these methods reached only US$4.8 billion in 2000, he added.</P>
      <P>Apart from Japan, Du noted, Taiwan is the largest absorber of
foreign capital of all the Asian nations.</P>
      <P>For his part, Day Sheng-tong, president of the Republic of China
Small and Medium Business Association and chairman of San Sun Hat and
Cap Co., said that the creativity and fast delivery of products
ordered are two advantages that Taiwan businesses have in the
international market.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan is becoming a stronger option for
manufacturers, as the profits in the mainland China manufacturing
sector are falling due to an increasing volume of production.</P>
      <P>The government should make use of the advantages that Taiwan
businesses have for soliciting foreign investment, he suggested.</P>
      <P>Walt Cheng, chairman of DuPont Taiwan, said that his company has
confidence in Taiwan in light of the fact that it has been in Taiwan
for 35 years.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is now the third-largest country in terms of the value of
DuPont investment, which now amounts to US$1 billion, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has a good geographic position to be a regional operation
hub, he added.</P>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun also attended the symposium, which was
jointly organized by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the China
External Trade Development Council and Central News Agency and was
presided over by CNA President Hu Yuan-hui.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NOW IS RIGHT TIME TO INVEST IN TAIWAN: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 5 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Now is the right time to invest in Taiwan,
Premier Yu Shyi-kung said at a symposium with business leaders
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Exchanging views with chief executives and officials of a group
of leading companies in Taiwan, the premier said the country's
economy is recovering strongly in the second half of this year,
citing a 5.4 percent expansion forecast for next year by the
Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) , part of the organization that
publishes the Economist magazine in Britain.</P>
      <P>In order to prompt a worldwide wave of investment in Taiwan, Yu
said the Executive Yuan is pushing forward with various projects to
improve infrastructure and increase the country's investment
incentives.</P>
      <P>The symposium, sponsored by the Executive Yuan, and organized
jointly by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the China External Trade
Development Council and the Central News Agency, is a prelude to a
high-profile investment promotion conference -- the 2003 Taiwan
Business Alliance Conference -- slated to take place from Oct. 19-22.</P>
      <P>Noting that the international economy is turning the corner in
the second half of this year and is predicted to grow by 3.2 percent
this year and 4.1 percent next year, compared to 2 percent in 2002,
the premier said that now is the right time to invest in Taiwan,
which he claimed is leading the world in terms of economic recovery.</P>
      <P>The government predicted 3.06 percent economic growth for this
year and 3.81 percent, or even more than 4 percent for 2004, while
the EIU forecasts an even more optimistic 5.4 percent for 2004, Yu
said.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the premier said, the risk of investment in Taiwan
has been reduced significantly thanks to the country's increasing
globalization and integration with the regional economy, as well as
the increasing transparency of business operations.</P>
      <P>As a result, various international consultancy companies, such as
the Switzerland-based International Institute for Management
Development, World Economic Forum and Business Environment Risk
Intelligence, and the Hong Kong-based Political and Economic Risk
Consultancy Ltd., are giving Taiwan high ranks in surveys about
worldwide investment environments.</P>
      <P>Pointing to a survey issued by the International Institute for
Management Development in May, the premier said Taiwan has moved from
seventh place in the world last year to sixth this year in terms of
competitiveness, because of its "marvelous economic performance and
government efficiency."</P>
      <P>The Business Environment Risk Intelligence ranks Taiwan's
investment environment at 1A -- representing a country with low risk
and therefore suitable for investment.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the World Economic Forum, which rates countries
worldwide according to their economic potential for the next five to
eight years, advanced Taiwan from 10th place in the world in 2000 to
third place in the world this year. All these surveys show that
Taiwan is an ideal place for investment, the premier said.</P>
      <P>He said the Executive Yuan is pressing ahead with plans to boost
investment by reducing the rent for land used by industry, offering
tax credits to investors, lifting the ceiling on foreign investment
in local stock markets, and streamlining finance regulations.</P>
      <P>The government's efforts have borne fruit, Yu went on, pointing
out that 159 companies had chosen Taiwan as their business operation
centers as of September and saying that the number is estimated to
hit 1,000 within 10 years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PASSAGE OF KEY LAW REVISIONS REMAINS UNCERTAIN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 5 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The passage of various major revisions to a
key law governing relations between the people of Taiwan and mainland
China remains uncertain, despite a lawmakers' decision to negotiate
and screen them in the Legislative Yuan again Thursday after
party-to-party talks broke up last week.</P>
      <P>Cheng Chen-long, legislative whip of the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) , said Sunday that his party will never give
way to the draft amendments to the seven key laws, especially those
relating to the Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of
the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the TSU lawmakers are determined to voice their
opposition to the passage of the revisions that would keep in place
an eight-year waiting period for mainland spouses of Taiwan residents
to apply for ID cards, would allow the recruitment of students in
Taiwan by mainland-based colleges and would permit the opening of
direct transport links across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Cheng, who claimed that approving the amendments would be
tantamount to "surrender, " said the TSU is resolved to seeking a
vote to decide the issues and make clear the party's firm stance,
despite the fact that its lawmakers already know what the result will
be -- the TSU controls only 12 seats in the 223-seat legislature.</P>
      <P>In the face of the many difficulties over the much-delayed
passage of the disputed draft amendments to the Statute Governing the
Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area
due to boycotts by the TSU and some members of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen
said she was disappointed but by no means desperate.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Thursday's extra session might be the last chance
for legislators to reach a final agreement over the law revisions
prior to the next presidential election in March 2004, she said the
timing for making the amendments will become increasingly sensitive
in the run-up to the presidential race.</P>
      <P>Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, however, was a little more
positive, saying that "the revisions might smoothly clear the
Legislative Yuan on Thursday. " He based his optimism on planned
negotiation efforts to bridge the differences between the various
political parties.</P>
      <P>He urged the ruling and opposition forces to repair their
year-long divisions over the legislation with wisdom and rationality
in order not to damage the public's interests.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI CITY OFFICIAL DENIES WRONGDOING IN SELLING CITY BANK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  5 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A financial official in the Taipei city
government denied any wrongdoing in incorporating the Taipei Bank, a
bank virtually controlled by the city government, into the private
Fubon Financial in August 2002.</P>
      <P>Lee Sush-der, director of the Financial Bureau, told a news
conference that Fubon was chosen by a panel of experts out of five
private financial companies that were interested in taking over
Taipei Bank.</P>
      <P>The process was carried out under the vigilant eyes of the
Ministry of Finance and the board of directors of the Taipei Bank,
and the regulations were followed to the letter, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors from the Taipei District Court have investigated the
process twice -- in August of last year and again in March this year
-- and the Control Yuan opened an investigation into the process in
October of last year, but none of these investigations have turned up
any evidence of wrongdoing, Lee said.</P>
      <P>He made the statement after former Taipei Bank Chairman Liao
Cheng-ching claimed the city government committed serious mistakes by
letting Fubon, which has assets of only NT$100 billion (US$2.97
billion), take over Taipei Bank, which has assets of more than NT$600
billion.</P>
      <P>The city government suffered losses of tens of billions of new
Taiwan dollars in the process, said Liao, who was forced to leave his
post at the bank by Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou in 2001 after he became
embroiled in a public quarrel with Taipei Bank General Manager Ting
Yu-kang at the city council.</P>
      <P>Liao's accusation came at the time when many Taipei city
councilors were accusing Ma of favoring Fubon by trying to sell back
to Fubon the city government's stock in the company at unreasonably
low prices. The city government got Fubon's stock through the
incorporation of Taipei Bank into Fubon Finance.</P>
      <P>Lee dismissed as "a layman's view" Liao's claims that Taipei Bank
is bigger than Fubon in terms of assets, saying that Taipei Bank's
gross assets were NT$658.7 billion before the acquisition took place
in August 2002, but most of its assets were deposits belonging to
depositors, so that its net assets were NT$45.8 billion.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Fubon Finance, which acquired the Taipei Bank,
is the parent company of Fubon Bank and others. It has gross assets
of NT$1.15 trillion and net assets of NT$138.8 billion, which is
almost three time larger than that of Taipei Bank.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Taipei Bank is facing the problem of shrinking
profits, which have decreased from NT$1.5 billion before it was
privatized in 1991 to less than NT$1 billion in the last two years
because its relatively small business scale has seriously limited its
competitiveness. The problem would not be solved unless it merged
with a bigger financial group that could complement its ability to
make a profit, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Measured by stock prices as of Thursday, the combined value of
Taipei Bank's stock has increased by NT$13.64 billion since it
entered into an incorporation agreement with Fubon Aug. 8,
2002. This is the best proof that Taipei Bank has benefited
from the incorporation, Lee argued.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Ching-hsiou, director of the city government's
Rules and Regulations Commission, said Liao's "false accusation" has
seriously hurt the city government's image and those of the related
officials, and that he should be held accountable for libel and
damage prompted by his "groundless" accusation.</P>
      <P>Liao could not be reached for comment Sunday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PEIYI RAILWAY BOT PROJECT TO BE FINALIZED BY YEAR-END: MOTC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   5   (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) officials said Sunday that they will know later
this year whether a direct railway line can be built linking Taipei
City with the northeastern county of Ilan.</P>
      <P>The MOTC Railway Engineering Bureau has contracted a private
engineering consultation firm to carry out a comprehensive assessment
of the feasibility of building a direct line through the mountainous
Peiyi area and of the development's impact on the environment, MOTC
officials said.</P>
      <P>The feasibility and environmental impact assessment of the BOT
(build-operate-transfer) project in which private investors will be
allowed to construct and operate the railway for a given period
before handing it over to the government -- is expected to be
available by the end of the year, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>In addition to the environmental impact, other factors, including
geological conditions, drilling capacity and protection of water
conservation are also major points to be included in the assessment
report, they added.</P>
      <P>The Peiyi railway, which will be about 42 kilometers long, could
be developed in two ways -- either from Taipei City's Nankang
District to Chiaohsi Township of Ilan County, or from Nankang to
Chiaohsi via Toucheng, another Ilan township located nearer to the
coast.</P>
      <P>The railway would be built in 10 years with a budget of around
NT$26.5 billion (US$0.79 billion), the officials noted.</P>
      <P>The MOTC began planning the project after residents of Ilan
appealed to the government that a direct line is needed to help the
northeastern county prosper, even though the highly publicized Peiyi
Freeway is 85 percent complete and scheduled to open to traffic by
the end of 2005.</P>
      <P>The Peiyi Freeway -- which links Taipei City and Ilan County --
has been called one of the most challenging road construction
projects in the world and was 85 percent complete as of
mid-September.</P>
      <P>Construction had been delayed because of the special geological
formation of Shueishan, the mountain through which the 12.9-km
Shueishan Tunnel will pass.</P>
      <P>More than a decade has passed since construction of the freeway
began in 1991. Boring work has often been halted due to the frequent
welling up of water at the construction site, as well as frequent
mudslides.</P>

assurances Sunday should he win a second term from 2004 through 2008,
saying that he will do his utmost to achieve the objectives if he is

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHIEF: TAIWAN SHOULD TRY TO JOIN U.N.-SPONSORED ORGANIZATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  5 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Instead of joining the United Nations,
Taiwan should first try to join working organizations sponsored by
the United Nations, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan
has said in an interview with the Washington Post.</P>
      <P>A statement issued Sunday by the KMT quoted Lien, who has served
in the past as foreign minister, as saying that Taiwan has had
difficulty returning to the United Nations because of its feud with
mainland China, which strongly opposes the country's access to the
world body, membership of which requires statehood.</P>
      <P>However, Lien pointed out, there are many U.N.-sponsored working
organizations which do not require statehood and therefore should be
easier for Taiwan to join.</P>
      <P>As a country with an advanced economy, Taiwan would be a valuable
member of such organizations, most of which are formed for the
purposes of improving weather forecasting, medical care, crime
fighting, the environment and coordinating monetary policies.</P>
      <P>Citing Taiwan's exclusion from the World Health Organization,
Lien noted that the island had to fight the severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) outbreaks alone earlier this year and became an
loophole in the worldwide defenses against the epidemic.</P>
      <P>Lien said the example serves as evidence that the absence of
Taiwan from these United Nations-sponsored working groups is a loss
not only to Taiwan but also to the whole world.</P>
      <P>The KMT statement did not say when and where the interview was
conducted, or whether it has been published or not.</P>

Vela's entourage.</P>
      <P>Chen welcomed the Central American parliamentarians to Taiwan and
thanked them for a resolution they adopted to support Taiwan's bid to
join the United Nations and the World Health Organization.</P>
      <P>Chen also voiced his appreciation for various recent activities
held jointly by the Republic of China and its diplomatic allies in

      <P>Vela also expressed great admiration for Chen's long-term efforts

    <HEADLINE>DPP ADMINISTRATION SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN PREVIOUS ONE: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun expressed pride in the
performance of his administration since the political transfer in
2000, claiming that its capacity to implement various projects was
several times better than that of the previous administration under
the Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Chun-yi of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) said in a general interpellation session at the legislature
that the DPP administration "is not afraid to make comparisons with
the previous one."</P>
      <P>Yu also expressed confidence in his administration when he spoke
of its performance over the past three years.</P>
      <P>The premier said that a 25-year contract for the Tatan power
plant in Taoyuan will lead to savings of NT$150 billion (US$4.437
billion) , while the government saved NT$250 billion on the
construction of the second north-south freeway.</P>
      <P>"The DPP government has make the best use of each penny, " Yu
claimed.</P>
      <P>He also said that state-owned enterprises have started to operate
in the black because of the efforts of the government. Between 1995
and 2001, China Shipbuilding Corp. and Tang Eng Iron Works Co. lost
NT$35 billion, but both began to make money last year, he said.</P>
      <P>The government also has helped the Kaohsiung region improve its
tap water system and residents will have clean piped water from the
end of this month, he added.</P>
      <P>He also cited the Taichung Science-based Industrial Park, at 304
hectares and with manufacturers having built plants there within just
one year, as a victory for his administration.</P>
      <P>The annual progress of the Beiyi Freeway was 3.8 percent on
average during the previous administration, but the ratio has jumped
to 21 percent since the DPP came to power, Yu said, adding that he is
confident the project can be completed as scheduled in 2005.</P>
      <P>He described the DPP's performance as "excellent" and said the
Cabinet is doing a good job in implementing various projects. He also
claimed that the difference before and after the 2000 political
transfer "is not double, but several fold."</P>
      <P>On the government's debts, the premier said that when President
Chen Shui-bian assumed office, the government was already NT$2,400
billion in debt, thanks to the KMT. As of the end of 2004, it will
have incurred interest payments of NT$500 billion, which will have to
be shouldered by the DPP.</P>

      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun denied Monday that his
Cabinet has a scheme to "frame" opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
Lien Chan and People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong in the
run-up to the March 2004 presidential election.</P>
      <P>In an interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan, the premier
dismissed as "groundless" an accusation made a day earlier by PFP
official Chang Hsien-yao that the Executive Yuan is brewing a scheme
codenamed "August 18" to set Lien and Soong up by delving into their
past government service in the hope of finding material with which to
smear them.</P>
      <P>Lien is set to pair up with Soong in the election, with Lien
running for president and Soong running for the vice presidency.</P>
      <P>Chang also accused the Democratic Progressive Party
administration of setting aside NT$100 billion for pork barrel
politics in an attempt to court DPP followers.</P>
      <P>Yu also denied these allegations.</P>
      <P>Also Monday, Executive Yuan spokesman Lin Chia-lung condemned
whoever spread the allegations, blasting them as irresponsible.</P>
      <P>"Anyone who claims the Executive Yuan is trying to tarnish their
image should come up with evidence rather than making unsubstantiated

      <P>The Sixth Asia-Pacific Intelligent
Transportation Systems (ITS) Forum opened Monday at the Taipei
International Convention Center, with Vice President Annette Lu
addressing the opening.</P>
      <P>Billing ITS as the leading and core technology in the current
service- and knowledge-based society that allows people to easily
navigate through intelligent transportation infrastructures, Lu said
the innovative technology is expected to trigger a social revolution
in the same way that IC technology led to the birth of the
information industry.</P>
      <P>Lu described ITS as a seamless entity that integrates
transportation and management information systems, saves time and
lives and reduces all types of resource-wasting, as well as helping
strike a balance in regional development and upgrading social
competitiveness and living standards.</P>
      <P>ITS will become the most essential infrastructure in terms of
national security and persistent development, she said, adding that
this is the reason behind the U.S. government's efforts to initiate
the National Intelligent Transportation Infrastructure (NITI) as far
back as the 1990s to seek to continue the country's economic
progress.</P>
      <P>The vice president expressed her hope that Taiwan and other
countries in the Asia-Pacific region will closely cooperate in
promoting ITS to secure the region's security and prosperity.</P>
      <P>It is the first time that Taiwan has hosted an international

that a wide range of commercial ITS applications are already in use,

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The consumer price index (CPI) has a chance
of returning to positive growth in the fourth quarter of this year
and the pressure of deflation could ease, Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that the annual CPI growth was down 0.22
percent in September, marking a fall for the third consecutive
quarter.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the positive forecast is based on the
economic recovery and a brisk stock market coupled with a lower base
for comparison last year.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the new Taiwan dollar's appreciation against the
U.S. dollar -- and the consequent lower import costs -- will trigger
more deflation, the officials said that although the domestic
currency has appreciated against the greenback, it has depreciated
against the yen and the euro, so that the prices of some imported
electronics have risen and therefore deflation will not necessarily
occur.</P>
      <P>The CPI was 99.46 in September, up 0.30 percent from the previous
month, the officials added.</P>
      <P>They attributed the increase largely to price rises for fresh
vegetables, fruit and meat in the run-up to the Sept. 11 Mid-Autumn
Festival, parents buying presents for babysitters, and tuition hikes
and other fees for the new academic year.</P>
      <P>The CPI in September was down 0.22 percent from the same month of
last year and the average CPI in the first nine months of this year
was 0.3 percent lower than the same period of last year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER TO ORDER PROBE INTO WATER SHORTAGES IN ABORIGINAL VILLAGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said he will order the
Cabinet's ethics division to investigate whether there have been any
irregularities involved in water supply construction projects in
several aboriginal villages in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yu was responding to complaints by independent Legislator May
Chin's that a number of mountainous tribal villages in Nantou County
have been plagued by serious water shortages.</P>
      <P>Chin said at a Legislative Yuan plenary session that over the
past two months she headed a team of aboriginal culture researchers
to survey the living conditions of indigenous people in Nantou's
several aboriginal townships, including Lona, Nanao, Tatung and
Fuhsing.</P>
      <P>"We were saddened when we found that many of the residents of
these villages did not have any piped water," Chin said.</P>
      <P>Chin said the village of Lona used to be Taiwan's largest
aboriginal village. During its heyday, the village had a population
of more than 2,700 people. Their ancestors built a dam more than 50
years ago to resolve their water supply problems but this was
destroyed in 1996 when Typhoon Herb swept through central Taiwan. The
government then spent NT$18 million and five years rebuilding a water
supply system.</P>
      <P>"The costly project only allowed Lona residents to enjoy piped
water for seven months. The system was destroyed again in 2001 when
Typhoon Toraj hit the area. Although the Nantou county government
spent NT$8.5 million building a new water supply system, Lona
residents still have no tap water," Chin claimed.</P>
      <P>She said the government should conduct a comprehensive review to
determine whether there have been any flaws or irregularities in
carrying out the reconstruction projects.</P>
      <P>In response, Yu admitted that there might have been some
drawbacks in implementing the projects. "I will ask the ethics
department to look into the cases and will also make an overall
review of water supply problems in mountainous aboriginal villages, "
he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Council of Aboriginal Affairs said natural
disasters have damaged water supply systems in the tribal villages
and that the council has launched a four-year plan to improve water
supplies for aboriginal people.</P>
      <P>"When the project is completed next year, the tap water supply
rate will reach 70 percent in those areas, " a council spokesman
claimed, adding that the council will draw up another improvement
project after the first plan is completed.</P>

budget for a national consultative referendum will be appropriated
according to law, although the operation of such a referendum have
not been finalized.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks in the Legislative Yuan when he was
addressing the concerns of an opposition legislator about the budget
for the proposed referendum.</P>
      <P>Legislator Kuo Chun-tsai of the opposition Kuomintang said that
by his estimate, the budget for a consultative referendum would be
between NT$400 million and NT$500 million (US$11.83 million and
US$14.79 million) . He wondered if this issue deserved the high

      <P>The premier replied that the Executive Yuan has yet to flesh out
the details of the referendum.</P>
      <P>Liu San-chi, director of the Directorate General of Budget,

agencies had not included a budget for the consultative referendum
in their 2004 proposed budget.</P>
      <P>But the premier reaffirmed that the related budget will be
appropriated "within legal bounds and will be according to law."</P>
      <P>The administration has said that it will push for a national
consultative referendum by next year's presidential election March
20, 2004, although Central Election Commission Chairman Huang
Hsih-cheng said last week that the commission has no money and

residues found in green soy beans and spinach imports from mainland
China since last year.</P>
      <P>Japan's customs officials have now further heightened their
scrutiny and control of mainland Chinese farm and dairy imports by
lifting their inspection rate from 5 percent to 20 percent, which has
resulted in a large decline in mainland exports to Japan, Chen
explained.</P>
      <P>Japanese consumers' grave concerns about the safety of mainland
Chinese produce has created a big advantage for similar Taiwan
products in the Japanese market and has led to greater Taiwan exports
to Japan, Chen pointed out.</P>
      <P>Chao Yung-chuan, secretary-general of the semi-official China
External Trade Development Council (CETRA) , said the good image of
Taiwan-made agricultural and farm products in Japan, although more
expensive by 20 percent than mainland China's goods, have cleared the
way for them to tap the international market.</P>
      <P>In a bid to sell Taiwan's safe, healthy and fine-quality farm and
agricultural produce, CETRA will help invite local farmers and
companies to take part in international food festivals and invite
foreign experts to strengthen bilateral exchanges, Chao added.</P>
      <P>According to tallies compiled by the Directorate-General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics, Taiwan exports of farm and
agricultural products were worth US$2.51 billion during the first
eight months of this year, up by 4.3 percent over the year-earlier
level.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exports to Japan grew by 13.4 percent during the same
eight-month period, while those to Hong Kong and the United States
dropped by 14 percent and 8.7 percent, respectively, the tallies
show.</P>
      <P>Japan, Hong Kong and the United States are Taiwan's prime
overseas markets for such products.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged Taiwan
manufacturers Monday to keep their business roots at home and to
support his administration's push for further constitutional reforms
to consolidate the island's young democracy.</P>
      <P>Chen made the appeal in a speech delivered at the joint opening
of the ninth annual conference of the World Federation of Taiwanese
Chambers of Commerce and the 10th annual conference of the Council of
Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce in Asia.</P>
      <P>Noting that a prosperous Taiwan will contribute to individual
business groups' global expansion plans, Chen said he is hopeful that
all local business people will give priority to investing in Taiwan
and retaining their business roots at home while making forays into
the world market.</P>
      <P>Chen said his administration has made strenuous efforts to
revitalize the domestic economy and attract foreign investments. "All
those efforts have paid off, " Chen said, adding that several
world-renowned market research firms, including the Swiss Business
Environment Risk Intelligence, have given high marks to Taiwan's
investment climate and overall national competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Since the government launched its six-year "Challenge 2008"
national development plan, Chen said, more than 10 famous
multinational business groups have set up research and development
centers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said, more than 250 overseas Taiwan companies
have also decided to establish their global operational headquarters
on the island by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>While corporate Taiwan epitomizes Taiwan's economic strength,
Chen said, Taiwan is the root of all Taiwan companies. "And all
business people will benefit from a stronger Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Chen also said Taiwan's democratic reforms have yet to be
completed. "We still have a lot of work to do, ranging from
education, judicial and financial overhauls to constitutional
reforms, " he stressed, adding that Taiwan must craft a
constitutional framework that fits its present realities.</P>
      <P>As overseas Taiwan business people have been a pivotal force
supporting the nation's economic development and political reform,
Chen said he is hopeful that they will support his call to introduce
a new constitution for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen made the "new constitution" appeal for the first time on
Sep. 28 at a rally marking the 17th founding anniversary of the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in his capacity as the ruling
party's chairman. He said he hopes that in 2006, when the DPP turns
20 years old, all of the 23 million people of Taiwan will push for a
new constitution.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A shipping tycoon in Taiwan predicted Monday
that barring any unexpected circumstances, the global economy will
gradually rebound after 2005.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-fa, chairman of the Evergreen Group, made the remarks
in a speech given at National Taiwan Ocean University to mark the
school's 50th anniversary.</P>
      <P>Chang said that based on an analysis of container cargo loads and
his experience over the years, he said that the world economy will
slowly regain strength after 2005.</P>
      <P>Unless something out of the ordinary happens, Chang said, such as
the United States-led military campaign against Iraq, or the Sept.
11, 2001 terrorist attacks against the United States, the world
economy will be solid by 2015.</P>
      <P>During the one-hour speech, Chang said shipping exchanges will
increase progress in civilization and technology development.
Mainland Chinese are more aware of this than those on Taiwan, he
said.</P>
      <P>He lamented that though Taiwan calls itself an ocean country, it
has no ocean policy.</P>
      <P>He noted that mainland China, after opening its markets, has seen
its coastal cities such as Dalien, Shanghai and Guangdong enjoy rapid
development, and the people there are even more affluent than people
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the hinterlands of mainland China, because of its
lack of stimulus and trade exchanges with the outside world, is
comparatively rather backwards, he said.</P>
      <P>He said that shipping can be a gauge of the direction of economic
development and cited the recent growth of cargo volume of container
vessels as an example.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER WANTS GRADUAL SHIFT TO VOLUNTEER MILITARY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  6  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Monday the
government will promote a volunteer military to replace the current
mandatory conscription system insofar as the nation's financial
resources will accommodate.</P>
      <P>Yu was responding to questions from opposition lawmakers about
his views on President Chen Shui-bian's recent call for further
constitutional reforms to pave the way for government restructuring,
including an overhaul of the military service system.</P>
      <P>Because of the development of electronic warfare and other
advanced defense strategies, Yu said, an all-volunteer military has
become a prevailing trend.</P>
      <P>Yu said that a conscription system under which draftees usually
leave the military after a relatively short period of service could
hinder accumulation of manpower training results.</P>
      <P>"As modern warfare technology requires long-term training, we
need more career soldiers. Therefore, an all-volunteer military is
the wave of future," Yu told lawmakers.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, Yu said, the Ministry of National Defense
(MND) has begun experiments with attracting individuals to join the
services voluntarily. "We'll promote the all-volunteer military in a
gradual manner according to the nation's financial condition, " he
added.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, opposition People First Party Legislator Lin
Yu-fang questioned the appropriateness of trying to introduce a
volunteer military in Taiwan, which would invariably be costly.</P>
      <P>Lin said the government cannot afford to adopt such a system
under which 80 percent of the military budget will be spent on
personnel costs.</P>
      <P>According to the MND's military restructuring plan, the total
number of military personnel will be cut from the current 380,000 to
340,000 by the end of 2006 and further lowered to 300,000 by 2011.</P>
      <P>"If we adopt a volunteer military system in 2006, the annual
personnel maintenance cost will increase by an estimated NT$95.4
billion from the current level. Even when the number of military
servicemen is trimmed to 300,000, the personnel cost will still
increase by NT$89 billion annually," Lin claimed.</P>
      <P>The exorbitant personnel cost will in turn hinder renovation of
weaponry systems and manpower training and eventually undermine
Taiwan's overall combat capability, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Worse still, Lin said the local social environment is not yet
ripe for creating a volunteer military.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the MND originally planned to receive three
battalions of volunteer, non-commissioned officers this year. But so
far, it has only managed to bring in 217 volunteers, Lin said, adding
that 139 of them are incumbent marine corpsmen who opted to change to
the new units.</P>
      <P>"Only 78 were civilians who volunteered to join the military. The
small number points to local youths' reluctance to pursue a military
career. This should serve as a warning to the government while
mulling an all-volunteer military," Lin noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FAMILY SUPPORT IMPORTANT FACTOR IN HELPING DEPRESSED YOUTHS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The amount of family support that a
depressed youth receives is a major factor influencing the level of
severity of the youth's depression, a psychology expert said Monday.</P>
      <P>Huang Kuo-yen, a psychology professor at National Chengchi
University, said that the higher the level of family support the
depressed juvenile receives, the less severe his or her depression
will be.</P>
      <P>Huang said that youths are just as likely to suffer from
depression or other emotional problems as adults are.</P>
      <P>Although most youths are inclined to share their feelings with
their peers, those who suffer mental or physical health problems will
fare much better if they seek and obtain support from their own
families, Huang noted.</P>
      <P>He urged the nation's youths to be on alert against the following
symptoms -- mood swings, difficulty concentrating, dizziness, the
sudden onset of feelings of sadness, and loss of appetite. Persons
who suffer most of these symptoms continuously for three weeks should
seek professional assistance immediately, Huang said, pointing out
that depression is treatable and curable so long as it is discovered
and tackled in time.</P>
      <P>The John Tung Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to
promoting public health, which completed an islandwide survey last
month about the mood climate of Taiwan adults, has made a short film,
titled "The Next Smile, " to call the Taiwan public's attention to
the problem of depression among youths.</P>
      <P>The foundation has also made handy printed charts available at
convenience stores islandwide to help youths to examine themselves
constantly so as to prevent themselves from falling into the quagmire
of depression or other mental or physical problems.</P>
      <P>The results of the foundation's survey last month revealed that
many Taiwan adults are not happy, with roughly 44 percent admitting
that they are troubled by depression.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 43.9 percent of the Taiwan adult
respondents confessed to having problems with depression, with 11.7
percent saying they feel they need medical treatment, 8.7 percent
saying they feel their stress has reached the "saturation point," and
23.5 percent saying they often experience mood swings.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that while 52 percent of the respondents
said they can distinguish between clinical depression and feelings of
depression, only 7.6 percent said they would consider seeking
professional assistance for a mental disease or emotional problems.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Monday ruled
out the possibility of talks with mainland China as long as Beijing
continues to impose conditions regarding such talks.</P>
      <P>In an interview by the Asian Wall Street Journal, Chen declared
that "we will walk our own road, our own Taiwan road."</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is not a province of any country, nor is it a state of
another," the president said, indirectly referring to mainland China
and the United States, respectively.</P>
      <P>"Any kind of democratic reform is our own internal affair. I
don't think any democratic country can oppose our democratic ideals,"
he was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>The newspaper said that the Bush administration has watched with
some alarm as President Chen has launched a series of initiatives -
including pushing for referendum legislation and vowing to introduce
a new constitution for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Chen said the "one-China principle " should not
exist. He also ruled out the possibility of accepting the 1992
consensus in which mainland China and Taiwan had agreed to allow for
their own respective interpretations of the "one-China principle, "
the paper said.</P>
      <P>"The so-called 1992 consensus is still a "one-China principle, "
Chen was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>"It's a way to make Taiwan a region; it belittles Taiwan; it
marginalizes Taiwan, " Chen reportedly said, adding that "the people
of Taiwan firmly believe that there is one country on each side of
the straits, one China and one Taiwan."</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A brand-new constitution is the key for
Taiwan becoming a normal, fully developed and great country,
President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In a defense of his call for a new constitution by 2006, the
president told a meeting of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) ,
of which he is chairman, that he made the call out of his concerns
over the people's well-being because an economic system on its own
cannot work unless it operates under a well political framework
defined by the constitution.</P>
      <P>If a government cannot work efficiently and a legislature cannot
work properly because of partisan bickering, it will inevitably
dampen private sector interest in investment, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, the DPP wants to reach its goal of economic
recovery through political reform that should start with rewriting
the constitution.</P>
      <P>The current political system, which enables a few lawmakers to
block legislation vital to the country and paralyze the entire
legislature, has to be overhauled from inside out, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The country cannot resort to dictatorship as a way to improve its
efficiency. However, it can rewrite a constitution to make it easier
and faster to formulate, review and implement policy, Chen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT DEBTS INCREASE BY NT$248.8 BILLION IN FOUR YEARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A government spokesman said Tuesday that the
government's debts will increase by NT$243.8 billion (US$7.21
billion) from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2004 after unusual and disaster
relief expenditures have been deducted.</P>
      <P>Lin Chia-lung made the remarks after various legislators
expressed concern about the government's unpaid debts, which are
expected to reach NT$3.4 trillion in fiscal 2004, accounting for 33
percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).</P>
      <P>Lin explained that after deducting the reconstruction fund for
the 1999 earthquake, the relief budget for the fight against severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) , the fund to compensate farmers'
losses due to agricultural imports, the budget for the reconstruction
of the Keelung River, and other unusual disaster expenditures,
government debts will see a net increase of only NT$243.8 billion
from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2004, by which time the Democratic
Progressive Party will have governed the country for four years.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in response to criticism that the government has not
streamlined the personnel of public agencies as it has promised to
do, Lin quoted statistics compiled by the Central Personnel
Administration showing that the government plans to hire 229,644
workers for its administrative sector in fiscal 2004, in comparison
with the 235,459 hired in fiscal 2003 and 248,519 hired in fiscal
2002.</P>
      <P>The government is also expected to hire 173,751 people in its
state-run enterprises in fiscal 2004, in comparison with the 180,610
hired in fiscal 2003 and the 193,570 employed in fiscal 2002.</P>
      <P>Lin added that although the government has increased the number
of public agencies, the real number of personnel hired by the
government agencies has fallen every year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MORE EFFECTIVE IN CRACKDOWN ON PIRATED COMPACT DISKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's efforts to clamp down on pirated
CDs, VCDs and DVDs have noticeably paid off in recent months since
the Copyright Law was amended in July requiring prosecution of
manufacturers and sellers of fake discs, a government official said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Lien-sheng, director-general of the Intellectual Property
Office under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) , made the
remarks at a news conference in which he also denied a media report
that claimed Taiwan is one of the world's three largest sources of
pirated discs, calling the figures cited in the report "groundless"
and "unfounded."</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the law amendment has effectively reduced
commercial piracy, while a police task force set up by the Criminal
Investigation Bureau has also been a useful weapon in the crackdown
on intellectual property rights violations.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the police ad hoc group seized a total of 5,906 pirated
CDs and 8,001 counterfeit DVDs and VCDs during the second half of
August at night markets across Taiwan. In September, a total of
11,411 fake CDs and 22,098 DVDs and VCDs were nabbed, he added,
noting that the amounts represent a large fall from the previous
levels, which easily hit 90,000 per month.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the sale of pirated discs has markedly fallen in
Taiwan and noted that the U.S.-based Music Publishers' Association
has also echoed this viewpoint after repeated fact-finding missions
to Taiwan's night markets.</P>
      <P>In addition, he added, an MOEA special committee made a total of
807 inspections on 76 disc manufacturing factories across the country
during the first nine months of this year, a large increase from the
year-earlier level of 144.</P>
      <P>Tsai reiterated the government's resolve to fully protect
intellectual property rights and urged what he described as
"discredited organizations" not to tarnish Taiwan's image in this
regard by issuing "groundless information."</P>

Fisheries Agency under the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture said
Tuesday.</P>

      <P>Chen said there are only a small number of Taiwanese fishing
boats operating in Costa Rican waters and they are not commissioned
to catch sharks.</P>
      <P>The agency has investigated similar reports issued by other
ecological and environmental protection organizations in the past and
found in each case that the ships involved were not from Taiwan, Chen
noted.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ecological and environmental organizations might be
mistaking foreign fishing vessels that employ Asian fishermen.</P>

    <DATELINE>Tainan,  Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Flamingo flowers grown in a small
southern Taiwan village have conquered Japan, agricultural sources
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chuang Chun-chin, head of a floral production cooperative in
Tainan County's Chungshe village in southern Taiwan, said that since
he took the initiative to plant flamingo flowers, also known as
anthurium, in styrofoam containers a few years ago, the imported
floral species has grown well in his village.</P>
      <P>"The success rate is almost 100 percent, " Chuang said, adding
that forcing the flowers in styrofoam containers cuts the growth
period by two to three months compared to time they need to reach
maturity using regular planting methods.</P>
      <P>According to Chuang, it takes only six to seven months for a
styrofoam container-grown flamingo plant to blossom. "The shortened
growth period gives us great leverage to compete with other countries
in the world market," he explained.</P>
      <P>Hawaii and the African state of Mauritius are Taiwan's strongest
competitors in this field, Chuang said. "We have competed fiercely
to make inroads into Japan, a major export market," he noted.</P>
      <P>Chuang said Taiwan is now Japan's largest flamingo flower
supplier, accounting for a 39 percent market share. "Chungsha village
alone accounts for 17 percent of Taiwan's annual flamingo flower
exports to Japan, or about 1.4 million stems worth more than NT$150
million, " he said, adding that the village is thriving on its
flowers.</P>
      <P>In the past, Chuang said, the annual income of a horticulturalist
in Chungsha was about NT$300,000. "Nowadays, each of them can make
two or three times that amount," he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Users of different age groups have different
purposes for the Internet, according to the results of a survey
released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the poll conducted by Insight Xplorer, a market
consulting company headquartered in Taipei, Internet users who were
born during the decade from 1971 to 1980 -- the so-called
"sixth-graders" -- accounted for the largest portion of Taiwan's
total cyber population in August at around 3.17 million.</P>
      <P>Those users who were born during the 1981-1990 period -- the
"seventh-graders" -- made up the second-largest age group at about
3.04 million, the survey found, while the "fourth-grade" age group --
users who were burn during the 1951-1960 period -- formed the
smallest ratio of less than 950,000.</P>
      <P>The seventh-graders, though fewer in number compared to the sixth
graders, spent the longest time per month -- an average 28 hours --
browsing on the Internet. These "heavy Internet users" were also the
most frequent online visitors browsing the largest number of Web
sites.</P>
      <P>According to the survey results, the seventh-graders were
entertainment-oriented, surfing the Internet in search of their
favorite music, personal pages and games.</P>
      <P>However, the sixth-graders went online largely to meet their
personal needs in August, mainly to find jobs, followed by online

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT FINANCES STILL HEALTHY: MOF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ministry of Finance (MOF) officials claimed
Tuesday that the government's financial situation can be considered
healthy, with unpaid debts accounting for 32.22 percent of the
country's gross domestic product (GDP).</P>
      <P>The officials noted that although the central government's
financial situation is still healthy and the ratio of its debt is
reasonable, government agencies are still trying hard to increase
revenues and reduce expenditures.</P>
      <P>They made the remarks in the wake of news reports saying that the
government's outstanding debts have reached NT$3.4 trillion (US$97.84
billion) , or 33 percent of the GDP. Quoting the statistics compiled
by the International Monetary Fund, the reports added that if efforts
are not made, the country might undergo a financial collapse.</P>
      <P>The officials said that as of the end of September, the
government's unpaid public debts had reached NT$3.18 trillion,
accounting for 32.22 percent of the GDP, a figure that is expected to
reach NT$3.43 trillion by next year, which is still within the
ceiling of 40 percent allowed under the public debt law.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the unpaid public debts of the U.S.
government accounted for 34.6 percent of its GDP in 2000, Japan's
public debts accounted for 106.5 percent of its GDP in 2002, while
United Kingdom's public debts were 49.9 percent of its GDP in 1997.</P>
      <P>Government debts accumulated rapidly in the last 10 years due
largely to the implementation of various construction projects
designed to stimulate economic development, expenditures in social
welfare, and extensive reconstruction work following the devastating
earthquake that hit Taiwan in 1999.</P>
      <P>In addition, the officials added, the corporate tax reduction
policy and the global economic recession have made the country's
stable income account for between 12.61 percent and 14.17 percent of
the GDP, while its expenditures since 2001 have accounted for between
77.65 percent and 86.38 percent of the GDP.</P>
      <P>The officials said the government has worked hard to increase its
revenues by avoiding inappropriate tax reduction programs and
reducing its expenditures with the aim of achieving financial balance
in five to 10 years.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan
should not turn back the government's budget plan, but should examine
it as soon as possible to avoid giving the people the impression that
lawmakers are indulging in partisan struggles while ignoring the
public interest, Premier Yu Shyi-kun warned Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Answering a question from a lawmaker of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, Yu said the operation of the Executive Yuan has
been affected in the past two years because its budget was not
approved by the legislature by the time set by law.</P>
      <P>Saying that the budgets of some government-owned enterprises had
been passed eight months later than required by law, the premier said
this had disrupted the running of these companies.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, lawmakers of the opposition People First Party (PFP)
pointed out 23 instances of what they called irregularities in the
budget plan, and urged the government organizations that prepared the
budget to correct them.</P>
      <P>Citing as examples, Chou Hsi-wei, PFP convener at the
legislature, said the Judicial Yuan prepared its budget on the basis
of a new organic law that has not yet been enacted by the Legislative
Yuan,</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Chou said, the budget illegally financed at least 65
government organizations, such as the National Human Rights
Exhibition Hall and the Higher Education Examination Committee.</P>
      <P>The lawmaker said his party won't return the budget plan to those
who drafted it; rather, the organizations that submitted the budget
should correct the errors themselves.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SIX MILITARY ACADEMIES TO BE INTEGRATED INTO ONE SCHOOL: MND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The six existing core military academies
will be integrated into a single university in 10 years, the Ministry
of National Defense said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Defense ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Huang Suey-sheng said at a
regular news conference that the military academies integration is
part of the nation's military restructuring and modernization plan
aimed at forging an elite deterrent force in the face of mainland
China's persistent military threats.</P>
      <P>According to the defense ministry's reform agenda, the Chinese
Military Academy, the Chinese Naval Academy, the Chinese Air Force
Academy, Fu Hsing Kang College, the National Defense Management
School and the Chung-cheng Institute of Science and Technology will
be integrated into one university to train career military officers
by 2012.</P>
      <P>The integration project will be carried out in two stages, Huang
said, adding that in the first phase from 2003 through 2006,
departments at the six academies will be merged or cut and their
staff will be trimmed. In the second stage from 2007 through 2012,
their campuses will be concentrated in one area or several areas.</P>
      <P>Touching on Premier Yu Shyi-kun's recent announcement that the
government will promote a volunteer military to replace the current
mandatory conscription system, Huang said an all-volunteer military
is truly the wave of future because of the development of electronic
warfare and other advanced defense strategies.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Huang said the defense ministry will carry out the
transformation project insofar as the nation's finances will allow
for the adjustment. The speed will also depend on the acquisition of
advanced weapons and the response of local youths to voluntary
military services, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Minister of Defense Tang Yiau-min said recently that
the ROC armed forces will be transformed into defense forces, with
the combined services brigade as the main operational unit to cope
with the nation's defense demands.</P>
      <P>The transformation, which will be carried out in a gradual
manner, is expected to be completed in 10 years, Tang said, adding
that in the first four years, various existing military academies
will be downsized and integrated. Several professional defense
research institutes will then be set up in tandem with the nation's
military buildup policy.</P>
      <P>From 2004 through 2006, Tang said, 45,000 servicemen will be
axed. In the second stage, he went on, the number of servicemen on
active duty will be cut to 270,000.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that
judging from the stock market and real estate market, Taiwan's
economy has indeed recovered and he urged the public to have
confidence in the government.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he spoke at the
ground-breaking ceremony of the second 12-inch fab of Powerchip
Semiconductor Corp. in Hsinchu, northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president said that steady growth in the stock market and the
rejuvenation of the real estate market have shown that the economy
has rebounded.</P>
      <P>He noted that since the containment of severe acute respiratory
syndrome in June, Taiwan's economy has been brisker.</P>
      <P>The stock market has grown by more than 30 percent since the
beginning of the year, and the government's incentive to halve the
land price increment tax as well as low interest rates for housing
loans have helped the house purchase rate to hit a new 16-year high.
The rate grew 23 percent this year from last year.</P>
      <P>The president said that judging from the fact that the public has
gradually pumped money into the stock market and real estate market,
Taiwan's economy is gradually rebounding and the situation is not
just a temporary recovery.</P>
      <P>The president also cited the words of Franklin D. Roosevelt: "We
have nothing to fear but fear itself, " to highlight his point that
"We must believe in ourselves, believe in Taiwan and in its economy."</P>
      <P>He also said that the government will continue to push for
deregulation, an open policy, improve the investment environment, and
solicit more enterprises to take part in major investment projects to
build momentum in the economic recovery.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. research institute SRI International is
planning to set up a research and development hub in Taiwan, in the
belief that Taiwan is a country with vast global potential and
competitiveness in biotechnological industrial development, an
industrial leader said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Tai Chien, administrator of the Southern Taiwan Science Park, who
has just returned from a trade and investment promotion tour of the
United States, said SRI International authorities have given great
credit to Taiwan's potential to be developed into an international
biotech R&amp;D stronghold.</P>
      <P>Tai said he met with some of SRI International's officers and was
told that if SRI International decides to relocate part of its R&amp;D
operations to Taiwan, the Southern Taiwan Science Park will be one of
the partners in Taiwan for cooperation.</P>
      <P>According to Tai, a mission from the Southern Taiwan Science
Park, a new "Silicon Valley" in Taiwan, visited the United States in
September, successfully soliciting 32 American companies to invest in
Taiwan. The prospective investments, including those in semiconductor
manufacturing, precision instruments, telecommunications and biotech
industries, are expected to be finalized in two to three years, he
said.</P>
      <P>SRI International, an independent, non-profit research institute
formerly known as Stanford Research Institute, provides high-value
solutions to a wide range of government, business and foundation
clients in information, communications and engineering technologies;
pharmaceuticals and biotechnology; chemicals and physics; and the
public policy areas of education, health and economic development,

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Thirty-two U.S. hi-tech companies are
willing to invest in two science-based industrial parks in southern
Taiwan over the next three years, with two of them already having
signed cooperation accords with Taiwan authorities, an official said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Tai Chien, director of the Southern Taiwan Science Park
Administration, made the report at a news conference after having
returned a day earlier from a tour of Los Angeles, Houston, Chicago
and San Francisco, which was aimed at attracting U.S. capital for the
two science-based industrial parks -- one in Tainan and the other in
Luchu, Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Tai said it was the fourth such trip organized by the
administration to the United States and that the response has been
far warmer than in the past as a result of an ongoing economic
recovery across the globe and a better understanding of Taiwan's
investment climate by U. S. businesses.</P>
      <P>The 32 prospective U.S. corporate investors are mainly from the
semiconductor, biotechnology, telecommunications and precision
machinery industries, Tai said, adding that two of them already have
agreed upon a memorandum of understanding with the administration,
while three will soon send officials on fact-finding missions to the
industrial park in Tainan.</P>
      <P>Over the past seven years, 116 companies have been allowed to set
up shop in the two southern science-based industrial parks and have
employed more than 16,700 workers, creating business revenue of over
NT$100 billion last year. The level is expected to top NT$150 billion
(US$4.438 billion) in 2003.

Taiwan, said Chao Ching-ho, a spokesman for the MND Office of Deputy
Chief of General Staff for Operations and Planning.</P>
      <P>As long as Beijing holds to the option of the use of force
against Taiwan, the MND will not talk about abolishing the Kinmen and
Matsu defense commands as has been alleged in recent local media
reports, Chao said.</P>
      <P>He said the MND has decided to surrender administrative control
of the six isles -- namely Tatan, Ertan, Tongting, Peiting, Menghuyu
and Shihyu -- in line with the will of local residents as expressed
in a series of meetings held with the residents since 1999.</P>
      <P>After the gradual removal of the military presence on the six
isles is completed, the Kinmen police and coast guard forces will
take over the responsibilities of maintaining law and order there,
Chao said.</P>
      <P>In the event of an outbreak of war in the Taiwan Strait, Chao
said, the MND is confident that these Kinmen isles will be in good
defensive hands authorized by the MND, which in recent years has
strived to upgrade the armed forces' surveillance, mobilization and
combat capabilities on a comprehensive basis.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO ACHIEVE BALANCED BUDGET IN 5 TO 10 YEARS: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Tuesday that the
administration has set the goal of achieving a balanced budget in
five to 10 years.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks in a general interpellation session
at the Legislative Yuan during which lawmakers expressed concern
about the worsening financial state of the nation.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Chuan-chiao of the opposition Kuomintang said that
the government registered a deficit of NT$800 billion (US$23.66
billion) between 2001 and 2003, asking whether there is any
possibility at all that it will be able to achieve a balanced budget.</P>
      <P>Finance Minister Lin Chuan replied that the government cannot
achieve such a goal in a short period of time, saying that it is now
trying to carry out a plan to achieve the goal in five to 10 years.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Huang Ming-hui cited news reports to point out
that the government's total outstanding debt has reached 3.4
trillion, or 33 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).</P>
      <P>The mass-circulation China Times reported that the government's
stable income, such as from taxes, as a ratio of the nation's GDP is
only 13.5 percent.</P>
      <P>If the government continues to run deficits every year, coupled
with the fact that the island's population continues to gray, meaning
fewer and fewer people paying taxes and more and more people
receiving social welfare benefits, the government could face
financial collapse if the island is struck by a natural disaster or
an economic crisis, the report said.</P>
      <P>The premier said that a financial reform committee under the
Ministry of Finance submitted a plan on achieving financial balance
in five to 10 years and that the Cabinet has accepted the plan.</P>
      <P>Minister Lin said that the plan has been implemented and that it
would be reviewed every two years, adding that "the chances are that
financial balance can be achieved in eight or nine years."</P>
      <P>The premier also said that the increases in the government
deficit are not as serious as reports have claimed, noting that the
deficit was a little more than NT$2.3 trillion for 2000 and that it
only rose about NT$1 trillion over the period of four years.</P>
      <P>If the interest payment of NT$500 billion and other unforeseen
expenditures such as those for the severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) outbreak between March and June of this year are excluded,
then the public deficit only amounts to about NT$40 billion a year,
the premier said.</P>
      <P>On the same occasion, the premier said that the government's
NT$20 billion public works project to stimulate employment has paid
off, noting that the unemployment rate for August was 5.21 percent,
down from 5.35 percent for the same month a year earlier.</P>
      <P>By the year's end, the jobless rate should be cut even further to
4.5 percent, the premier said.</P>

prime minister.

1950: Communist Chinese troops enter Tibet.

1958: Communist Chinese begin to launch a mass movement in
Tientsin to make iron and steel, in which about 100 million people

policy. He also emphasizes the ROC will never negotiate with the

2000: Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan confirms that the Ministry of
Justice's Investigation Bureau will formally phase out its
controversial "political surveillance" work soon.

perfect divine moral nature who is able to combine in himself
quickness of magnanimity, generosity, benignity, and gentleness:
qualities necessary for the exercise of patience."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>30 PROPOSED R&amp;D CENTERS SHOW THAT WORST IS OVER FOR ECONOMY: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 8 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday that
the worst is passed for Taiwan's economy as evidenced by the fact
that 30 world-class companies plan to open research and development
(R&amp;D) hubs in the country by 2006.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while taking part in a ceremony at the
Presidential Office marking the publication of a new book picturing
his journeys to 319 villages and townships across Taiwan over the
past three years since he came to power in May 2000.</P>
      <P>Saying that only actions will make dreams come true, Chen said
that the hard days for Taiwan are already over, as the domestic
economy has shown strong signs of recovery at a time when Taiwan is
facing a historic juncture.</P>
      <P>In view of the dramatically changing situations in the
international community, Chen stressed that the government is
determined to continue with reforms on all fronts to make Taiwan into
a competitive country.</P>
      <P>Citing the newest report made public in August by the
Switzerland-based Business Environmental Risk Intelligence, he said
Taiwan still was rated as one of the world's best countries in terms
of investment climate - tied for fourth with Japan among the major 50
countries cited.</P>
      <P>Chen said Sony and HP, two of the 24 foreign-based multinationals
wishing to establish R&amp;D centers in Taiwan, have been granted
approval. He forecast that by 2006, an additional 30 international
business groups will also open such facilities in the country, proof
that the government's trade and monetary liberalization and market
opening efforts have paid off.</P>
      <P>He said he strongly believes that more world-class enterprises
will be willing to invest in Taiwan after the 2003 Taiwan Business
Alliance Conference slated for Oct. 19-22 in Taipei has been held.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE REAFFIRMS STANCE ON CROSS-STRAIT STABILITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and the United States have the same
stance on maintaining stability across the Taiwan Strait and on
pushing for an early resumption of cross-strait dialogues, a
Presidential Office spokesman said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>James Huang, director of the Presidential Office's Public Affairs
Department, was refuting opposition parties' claim that President
Chen Shui-bian's recent appeal to rewrite the ROC Constitution and to
amend laws so that islandwide referendums can be held would undermine
Taiwan-U.S. relations.</P>
      <P>Huang said Chen had made it clear in a recent interview in Taipei
with John Pomfret, Beijing bureau chief of the Washington Post, that
the political reforms he wants to make would not touch on sensitive
issues that might provoke mainland China.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Chen's call to introduce a new constitution for
Taiwan is mainly aimed at consolidating Taiwan's young democracy and
upgrading its overall competitiveness, Huang said it was opposition
parties' misinterpretation of Chen's appeal as moves to instigate
ethnic disharmony and provoke mainland China that could adversely
affect Taiwan-U.S. relations.</P>
      <P>Huang said Chen had emphasized in his interview with the
Washington Post that pushing for these democratic reforms has nothing
to do with the issues of independence or unification. "So the things
that America is concerned about won't happen."</P>
      <P>Huang acknowledged that Washington has expressed concern about
the proposed political reforms, but he denied that America is
pressuring Taiwan to back away from the changes.</P>
      <P>"Concern is not the same thing as pressure, " Huang said. "Being
concerned doesn't mean that you're going to get involved in another
nation's domestic affairs."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN PROTESTS SWISS DESIGNATION CHANGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has
lodged a protest with Switzerland over an arbitrary change of
Taiwan's designation on the Alien Resident Certificates it issues to
Republic of China nationals living there, an official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>For the last month, the official said, the Swiss government has
identified the nationality of ROC passport holders as "Chinese
Taipei" on their residence certificates. Prior to that, the Swiss
government identified the nationality of ROC citizens as "Taiwanese"
in those documents.</P>
      <P>"We have lodged protests with the Swiss government through our
representative office in Bern and Switzerland's representative office
in Taipei," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the Swiss authorities have responded
to the ROC's protest by claiming that they were pressured by mainland
China to change Taiwan's designation.</P>
      <P>"We have informed the Swiss government that the arbitrary
designation change is unacceptable, " the official said, adding that
the MOFA is still negotiating the issue with the Swiss authorities.</P>
      <P>Because of Beijing's pressure, Taiwan cannot join major
international organizations under its official title of the Republic
of China. For example, it is designated as "Chinese Taipei" in the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum and as the "Separate Customs
Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu" in the World Trade
Organization.</P>
      <P>However, reports from Geneva quoted Swiss officials as having
said that the designation change was not adopted as a result of
Beijing's pressure, nor has it had anything to do with Taiwan's
recent issue of a new version of its passport bearing the word Taiwan
on its cover to distinguish it from that of the People's Republic of
China.</P>
      <P>The unnamed Swiss officials claimed that the designation change
is mainly an "internal administrative technical matter" aimed at
differentiating Taiwan and mainland Chinese citizens residing in
Switzerland, the reports said.</P>

      <P>The deputy secretary-general of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Wednesday that relations
between Taipei and Washington are close and that the two countries
have smooth channels of communication.</P>
      <P>Lee Ying-yuan made the remarks after concern was raised about
U.S-Taiwan ties following President Chen Shui-bian's unusually strong
words toward the United States and mainland China pronounced in an
interview with the Washington Post.</P>
      <P>Chen said in the interview that he will not bow to U.S. pressure
to modify recent moves -- including his proposal to hold a referendum
on rewriting the constitution and the decision to add the name Taiwan
to Republic of China passports -- which Bush administration officials
fear will heighten tension with Beijing, according to Washington

      <P>Referring to Chen's remarks, Lee noted that Taiwan and the United

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 2,000 mixed-marriage children have
enrolled in elementary schools in Taipei and about 40 percent of them
have a hard time adapting to school life, according to the results of
a survey released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Education Department of the Taipei city government conducted
the survey in mid-September.</P>
      <P>The survey discovered that 2,199 schoolchildren from
mixed-marriage families have enrolled into primary schools around the
city, accounting for 1.14 percent of the total enrollment.</P>
      <P>Most of them are from families with foreign parents and about 900
are from families with one or both parents from mainland China,
according to the survey.</P>
      <P>According to the results, 732 of these children have difficulty
with their studies and 458 are struggling to adapt to campus life. As
these two groups of students partially overlap, the total number of
mixed-marriage children with adaptability problems is 838, or 38.11
percent of all the mixed-marriage schoolchildren studied.</P>
      <P>Education Department officials said adaptability problems shown
by mixed-marriage children include poor motivation or interest in
study, reluctance to abide by etiquette and rules, difficulty
speaking Mandarin Chinese, poor social skills, emotional instability,
untidiness, inclination to lie or steal, and failure to get along
with classmates of the opposite sex.</P>
      <P>The problems mainly result from their parents' language barriers,
disadvantageous economic status, cultural differences and a lack of
parenthood education, the officials claimed.</P>
      <P>Wu Ching-chi, director of the Education Department, said the city
government will join forces with community colleges and adult
education organizations to open language and parenthood classes for
foreign and mainland Chinese spouses of local citizens.</P>
      <P>"The Education Department will also ask elementary school
authorities to offer more counseling to help mixed-marriage children
adapt to school life and academic study," Wu added.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, Wenshan, Shihlin and Hsinyi top the
various Taipei districts in terms of the number of mixed-marriage
schoolchildren, while Chungshan and Neihu have the largest ratios of
students with adaptability problems.</P>

      <P>A total of US$3.247 billion in foreign

the second-highest level following the record monthly high of
US$4.218 billion posted in August, an official of the Securities and

      <P>According to the SFC official, qualified foreign institutional
investors (QFII) and non-QFII investors poured US$60.121 billion into
Taiwan during the first nine months of this year -- US$51.465 billion
by QFII and US$8.656 billion by non-QFII -- representing a growth of
US$3.247 billion over the US$56.874 billion as of Aug. 31.</P>
      <P>However, US$44 million in foreign capital was remitted during the
first three days of October, bringing down the September total to
US$60.077 billion, the official noted.</P>

commemorate successful agricultural cooperation between the two
countries, a Chunghwa Post Co. spokesman said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The state-owned postal firm will hold a ceremony at the Postal

stamps. The 10-stamp collection will be sold both in Burkina Faso and
Taiwan. Each set will be sold for NT$180, the spokesman said.</P>

facilities in the West African state built with the assistance of the

    <HEADLINE>ALL-VOLUNTEER MILITARY UNFEASIBLE BEFORE 2112: MND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is unlikely to adopt an all-volunteer
military service system before 2112, according to an armed forces
restructuring plan mapped out by the Ministry of National Defense
(MND), Defense Minister Tang Yiau-min said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan Defense Committee
meeting, Tang said an all-volunteer military will be feasible only
when smaller numbers of servicemen are required, the defense budget
reaches certain levels and all the necessary advanced weaponry
systems are acquired -- all of which have been forecast to be
achieved by 2112 or later.</P>
      <P>The issue of a voluntary military service system was made part of
the conversation at the committee's meeting Wednesday in response to
President Chen Shui-bian's recent moves to promote a new constitution
for Taiwan, under which efforts will be made to facilitate an
all-professional military to replace the current mandatory
conscription system.</P>
      <P>Legislators Chiang Chi-wen, Lin Yu-fang and Liao Wan-ju together
asked Tang's opinion on the scenario of the MND not being able to
recruit any young Taiwan men once the all-voluntary military system
is adopted since, as they said, not a single soul in Taiwan wants to
serve in the military.</P>
      <P>Tang said it is an irreversible trend that the military is
becoming "lean and mean, " with the number of men and women in
uniform gradually decreasing and the forces increasingly becoming
high-tech.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tang said that the ROC armed forces will be
transformed into defense forces, with the combined services brigade
as the main operational unit to cope with the nation's defense
demands.</P>
      <P>The transformation, which will be carried out in a gradual
manner, is expected to be completed in 10 years, Tang said, adding
that in the first four years, various existing military academies
will be downsized and integrated. Several professional defense
research institutes will then be set up in tandem with the nation's
military buildup policy, he added.</P>
      <P>From 2004 through 2006, the number of servicemen will be cut by
45,000, he said. In the second stage, he continued, the number of
servicemen on active duty will be reduced to 270,000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RESULTS OF STUDY ON ORGANIZATION LEADERSHIP IN SINGAPORE RELEASED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct.  9  (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The first-ever statewide study of
organizational leadership in Singapore found that the city-state's
workforce rates its leaders highest in the areas of financial
stewardship, integrity and respect for workers.</P>
      <P>The first phase of the study, jointly sponsored by the Gallup
Organization, the Singapore Institute of Management, and the Gallup
Leadership Institute, looked at a series of attributes associated
with leadership that have been used in validated indexes in Europe,
the United States, Australia and New Zealand.</P>
      <P>The first phase included findings from the general working
population in Singapore. The second phase will involve establishing a
representative sample of organizations from the public and private
sector where employees from those organizations evaluate the
leadership style of their immediate supervisor or the top leadership
within their organization.</P>
      <P>Dr. Bruce Avolio, director of the Gallup Leadership Institute,
said "the results reflect some of the core strengths associated with
Singapore's culture, including organizational financial strength,
trust in the integrity of leadership, and treating individuals with
respect."</P>
      <P>The study also found that Singaporean corporate leaders scored
appreciably lower on the key dimensions that drive workforce
innovation, engagement and performance.</P>
      <P>Specifically, Singaporean leaders were rated as less visionary
than their U.S., Australian, New Zealand and European counterparts,
as well as less optimistic, less willing to challenge old ways of
doing things, less likely to sacrifice their self-interests, and less
likely to pay attention to the moral and ethical consequences of
their decisions.</P>
      <P>Comparing across industries and government, government leaders
were generally rated highest on all scales except in encouraging
employees to be creative and entrepreneurial at work.
Information-technology industry leaders received the highest ratings
in this category.</P>
      <P>The general pattern of findings in the first phase of the study
indicated that leaders in Singaporean organizations could place more
emphasis with their workers on the importance of learning new ways of
doing their work, developing each other, being entrepreneurial,
working creatively and encouraging more ownership of their jobs,
especially in the manufacturing, service and business services
industries.</P>
      <P>More specific data focusing on the relationship between the
leader and his or her workers is currently being collected in the
second phase of the study.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The corporate travel trade has almost
fully recovered in the Asia-Pacific region, according to an American
Express post-SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) travel analysis
for the region released recently.</P>
      <P>Corporate Travel in SARS-impacted markets such as Singapore, Hong
Kong and Taiwan took only three weeks to hit rock bottom, with
trading down 90% as of the end of May. Nine weeks later, however,
corporate travel trade had recovered almost fully to the previous
year's levels, according to the analysis.</P>
      <P>The analysis also reveals that corporate travel in
non-SARS-impacted markets such as Australia, India and New Zealand
dropped over a three week period to a trading low down 50% on 2002
but had almost recovered within five weeks, much faster than the
SARS-impacted markets.</P>
      <P>The negative impact of SARS was quick and deep, beginning in
early April and peaking in late April. Recovery was slower with
SARS-impacted markets recovering by mid-July and non-SARS-impacted
markets recovering through late June. Both markets, however, had

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATURE APPROVES LAW REVISIONS ON CROSS-STRAIT EXCHANGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  9 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan approved Thursday
various controversial amendments to a key law governing exchanges
between the people of Taiwan and mainland China, creating a new page
in cross-Taiwan Strait interaction.</P>
      <P>The long-disputed revisions to the Statute Governing the
Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland
Area, which cleared the legislature through a vote, include
maintaining the eight-year waiting period for mainland spouses of
Taiwan residents before they can receive ID cards, allowing
recruitment by mainland-based colleges in Taiwan and the opening of
direct cross-strait transport links.</P>
      <P>Another critical amendment allowing the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) to commission accredited and professional privately run
organizations to handle civic exchanges between the two sides and
permitting those MAC-commissioned private agencies to commission
other institutional bodies to deal with related affairs was also
approved.</P>
      <P>In addition, all levels of local governments, public opinion
organizations and institutional groups are prohibited from conducting
negotiations or signing agreements in any shape or form with the
mainland authorities on law-enforcement and political issues without
having first obtained permission from the MAC or relevant government
agencies, according to the revision.</P>
      <P>One amendment allows Taiwan people to carry an amount of mainland
currency -- to be set by the Ministry of Finance -- to and from the
mainland, while another revision permits mainland-based companies to
open branches or offices in Taiwan on a case-by-case basis, as long
as they obtain permission to do so from the relevant Taiwan
authorities.</P>
      <P>In future, Taiwan people heading for the mainland will be treated
at immigration in compliance with foreign-bound standard procedures
without having to gain a travel permit from the government. However,
government officials, the mayors of Taipei and Kaohsiung and public
servants charged with secret state information are still banned from
traveling across the strait.</P>
      <P>The passage of the critical amendments after a year-long
postponement because of sharp divisions among the various political
parties are expected to facilitate two-way exchanges in trade,
traffic and academic research and give a boost to a wide range of
activities, according to observers.</P>

      <P>The five-day Taipei international
electronics show -- TAITRONICS-Components and Equipment 2003 --
opened Thursday at the Taipei World Trade Center.</P>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Yiin Chii-ming, China External Trade
Development Council Chairman Hsu Chih-jen and president of the Taiwan
Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers' Association Hsu Sheng-hsiung
jointly presided over the opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>Yiin noted that 707 enterprises from nine countries are
exhibiting the cream of their electronic components and equipment,
offering a wide variety of options to buyers.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that in the face of the fierce global competition,
Taiwan electronics companies should keep on top of the rapidly
changing industrial trends so that they can receive orders more
easily.</P>
      <P>Citing the field of notebook computers as an example, Hsu said
most Taiwan manufacturers are trying to reach the goal of delivering
ordered goods in two days.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the production volume of Taiwan's electronics
components totaled NT$839.7 billion (US$24.91 billion) last year,
with IC products and monitors the biggest sellers. Production is
expected to reach NT$939.7 billion this year, an increase of 11.8
percent over last year.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that in order to maintain high competitiveness, many
domestic electronics manufacturers have shifted their production of
low-level items overseas and are concentrating on research and
development, marketing and high-end production at home.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan firms should also accelerate the
establishment of logistic systems worldwide to sustain their
competitiveness, Hsu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATURE PASSES AMENDMENTS TO ELECTION LAW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed a package of
amendments to the Public Officials Election and Recall Law Thursday
that allows different political parties to field a joint ticket in
the presidential election.</P>
      <P>The amended law provides a legal basis for the teaming-up of the
two opposition "pan-blue alliance" leaders -- Kuomintang Chairman
Lien Chan and People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong -- to
challenge President Chen Shui-bian's re-election bid next year.</P>
      <P>The revised law also raises the ceilings for campaign funding for
various kinds of public elections. According to the new act, the
campaign fund for next year's presidential election can reach a
maximum of NT$400 million.</P>
      <P>However, lawmakers rejected a proposal that would have barred
citizens born outside of Taiwan from running for president or vice
president.</P>
      <P>The proposal had been dubbed "the Arnold clause" because it was
similar to a U.S. ban on foreign-born citizens -- such as
Austrian-born California Governor-elect Arnold Schwarzenegger --
running for president.</P>
      <P>The measure was proposed by the opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) , which is worried that one of the growing number of
immigrants from mainland China might one day become president and
unify the island with its communist neighbor.</P>
      <P>"Now that so many Chinese have entered Taiwan as immigrants, we
have to draw up some clauses to protect the rights of the natives, "
TSU Legislator Chen Chien-ming said.</P>
      <P>But opponents argued that the ban would be unfair. "People who
have no way of choosing where their mothers gave birth would be
politically isolated for a long time," said one PFP lawmaker.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an "absentee vote" proposal broached by the opposition
Kuomintang was also rejected by lawmakers.</P>
      <P>According to the revised law, political parties will also be fined
if their nominees for public elections are convicted of vote-buying,
organized crime or other felonies.</P>
      <P>It stipulates that parties will be slapped with a fine of between
NT$5 million and NT$50 million if any of their candidates are
convicted of vote-buying, use of violence in the campaign process,
candidacy fixing, organized crime or other felonies subject to a
minimum 10-year prison term.</P>
      <P>The new regulation is aimed at pushing political parties to be
more prudent in nominating their standard-bearers in public elections
and thereby allowing the establishment of clean politics.</P>
      <P>In addition to strengthening the mechanism to prevent those with
links to organized crime from entering politics, the package also
proposes penalties for vote-buying in intraparty primary elections.</P>
      <P>Moreover, those involved in vote-buying in the elections of
speakers and deputy speakers of legislative councils at central and
local levels could be given prison terms ranging between three and 10
years plus fines ranging between NT$1 million and NT$10 million.</P>
      <P>In addition, the package clearly forbids political parties or
individuals from publishing, reporting or quoting the results of
election public opinion polls within 10 days of a political election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINESE FISHING BOAT INTERCEPTED NEAR TIAOYUTAIS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Oct. 9 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A fishing boat carrying people from mainland
China, Hong Kong and Taiwan was intercepted by a Japanese Coast Guard
patrol boat Thursday near the Senkaku Islands, known as the
Tiaoyutais in Chinese, according to a Japanese Coast Guard officer in
Naha, Okinawa.</P>
      <P>The fishing boat carrying 15 people was spotted some 45 km west
of the Tiaoyutais by the patrol boat and intercepted when it was some
22 km from the islands, the officer said.</P>
      <P>The people aboard the fishing boat protested against the
interception through loudspeakers, waved People's Republic of China
flags and unfurled a banner claiming that the Tiaoyutais belong to
China, said the officer.</P>
      <P>One of the men on the fishing boat also used a video camera to
film the confrontation, said the officer.</P>
      <P>The boat managed to sail as close as one kilometer from the
islands before being turned away by the patrol boat.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a member of a Hong Kong group organized to press for
China's claim over the Tiaoyutais said earlier in the day in Hong
Kong that two members of his group, including David Chu Yu-lin, a
member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council, joined six others from
mainland China for the voyage to the Tiaoyutais on the fishing boat
out of Xiamen, in mainland China's Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>They were joined by two other protesters from Taiwan at sea off
Taiwan Thursday and then tried to land on the islands and raise the
flags of Taiwan and mainland China to underpin their countries'
territorial claims to the islands.</P>
      <P>They timed the landing to mark a similar action taken by members
of the same group Oct. 7, 1996.</P>
      <P>Located some 240 nautical miles southwest of Okinawa, the five
tiny uninhabited islands with a combined size of 6.3 square
kilometers, are claimed by Japan, mainland China and Taiwan. It
rarely makes headlines except when extremists from the three
countries make high-profile landfalls to highlight their country's
territorial claims to the islands.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The military will focus on developing
precision guided missiles, unmanned aircraft, superconductivity and
nanotechnology, according to a five-year military buildup plan
unveiled Thursday by the Ministry of National Defense (MND).</P>
      <P>The MND outlined its five-year military buildup plan in a report
delivered to the Legislative Yuan, as required by an amendment to the
defense law that requires the ministry to present to the legislature
a report on mainland China's military development and a report on
Taiwan's five-year military buildup plan annually. The ministry
presented its mainland military buildup report earlier this year.</P>
      <P>According to the MND's five-year plan, the military will step up
research and development of various types of guided missiles,
anti-tank weapons and gunships, as well as unmanned aircraft and
cutting-edge nanotechnology and superconductivity defense technology.</P>
      <P>The report said the military will also strive to maintain
supremacy in electronic warfare technology and to build up a
comprehensive C4ISR architecture.</P>
      <P>Another priority is the establishment of an anti-submarine combat
command system and a coastal anti-submarine command center, the
report said.</P>
      <P>Quoting the MND report, opposition People First Party Legislator
Lin Yu-fang noted that the MND will need NT$1.59 trillion to finance
its plan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, unconfirmed press reports said that the Chungshan
Institute of Science and Technology -- the military's research arm --
is concentrating efforts on developing anti-ship and
surface-to-surface missiles, including cruise missiles that can hit
targets in mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MUST RECTIFY ITS NAME: LEE TENG-HUI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, Oct. 9 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan must rectify its name because all
the difficulties it has encountered are linked to its impractical
name "the Republic of China", former ROC president Lee Teng-hui said
in an article published Thursday in the Far Eastern Economic Review.</P>
      <P>Taiwan must begin to correct its name, making the nation and its
official name consistent with reality, Lee stressed in his article.</P>
      <P>In early September, over 150,000 people gathered in front of the
Presidential Office in Taipei to support a proposal for what is
called the "rectification" of Taiwan's name, he continued.</P>
      <P>"As I worked to advance the cause of freedom and democracy in
Taiwan during my 12 years as president, I met with many difficulties
and obstacles that brought me to the conclusion that Taiwan is not a
'normal country'," he noted.</P>
      <P>A normal country's path towards development is influenced by its
history and by its geography. People seek the most advantageous
course by reflecting upon their past and considering where they are
situated in the physical world.</P>
      <P>But over the past two centuries, Taiwan has been ruled by
external powers. Its goals and political system, in particular, have
been imposed by outside regimes, without any influence by the people
of Taiwan, without any heed of their views and needs. For a very long
time, outside powers dictated the way life was lived by Taiwan's
people.</P>
      <P>Even now-three years after the democratic transfer of political
power-we suffer from the debilitating effect of this historical
burden. The people of Taiwan still are unable to muster the
determination to be their own masters, to shoulder the
responsibilities they alone ought to bear, to deliberate on the
nation's future goals, to bravely face challenges and pursue ideals.
This is a cause for regret, and it must be remedied.</P>
      <P>While, admittedly, the establishment and progress of a nation
cannot be shackled by history, it cannot completely dissociate itself
from the past.</P>
      <P>History cannot be changed, but the future is for us to define.
How we define our identity is an exercise made against the backdrop
of our antecedents. One reason Taiwan is not a normal country is
because it has not been able to come to terms with its own history
and to establish a Taiwan-centric frame of thinking. Creating a
Taiwan-centred environment and realizing the ideals of a normal
country are the goals towards which Taiwan should strive.</P>
      <P>Lee said that he recently claimned "The Republic of China no
longer exists" based on three reasons:</P>
      <P>First, when the Republic of China was established in 1912, it by
no means encompassed Taiwan;</P>
      <P>Next, after World War II, the Republic of China was a military
occupier of Taiwan, and Taiwan's actual status ought to be deemed a
land belonging to no country, whose international status has yet to
be defined-not as a part of the Republic of China's already-existing
territory;</P>
      <P>Lastly, after 1949-when Chinese communists took the mainland
territory of the Republic of China-the Republic of China in fact no
longer possessed any territory, with only its name continuing to
exist. Although the name "Republic of China" was hung on Taiwan, ever
since the People's Republic of China supplanted the Republic of China
in the United Nations in 1971, the Republic of China vanished from
the international community. People should realize that the "Republic
of China" is just an official name, not a nation.</P>
      <P>Through democratization, Taiwan has finally established a native,
Taiwan-rooted democratic regime. Such a native government ought to
plan for the well-being of all Taiwan's inhabitants, serve the people
and work hard to act on the public's demand for rectification of
Taiwan's name.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CAA CONSIDERING STIFF PUNISHMENT FOR DRUNKEN PILOTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)
admitted Thursday that the captain of a China Airlines (CAL)
passenger plane was over the alcohol limit while on duty and said the
CAA is considering a stiff punishment for the man.</P>
      <P>The captain was prohibited from boarding an Anchorage-to-New York
flight after a screener at Anchorage airport smelled alcohol and
found an open container of alcohol on the pilot's person, whereupon
he was breathalyzed, according to wire reports.</P>
      <P>CAA officials said they had questioned the breath test and had
contacted U.S. Federal Aviation Administration for a renewed
investigation.</P>
      <P>The officials said that when Anchorage officials tested the
pilot, he was found to have a blood-alcohol level of.087 percent,
almost double the FAA's permitted level for pilots of .04 percent.</P>
      <P>However, the Taiwan authorities originally had doubts about the
calculation of the figures because in Taiwan, the limit for a breath
test is 0.2 milligrams per liter. They had asked therefore for a
re-investigation, which confirmed that the pilot was at fault, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials said that although the pilot attempted to defend
himself by claiming that he had refrained from drinking alcohol 12
hours prior to going on duty, the result of the breath test showed
that he was over the limit, which is a serious problem of
professional ethics that is subject to punishment ranging from a fine
of just NT$60,000 (US$1,775) to revocation of the pilot's license.</P>
      <P>CAL officials said that they had yet to receive a formal report,
and declined to comment on the matter, although they stressed that
the pilot, who has been suspended from duty, will be punished
severely if he is found to have breached flight rules.</P>

      <P>A visiting German solar energy expert hailed
Taiwan Thursday as a springboard for enhanced exchanges and
cooperation between Germany and Asia in the development of
alternative energy sources.</P>
      <P>Dr. Uwe Hartmann, chief executive officer (CEO) of the Institute
for Elektroniske Systemer (IES) and a professor at the University of
Sarrbruecken, said he hopes to meet Taiwan business representatives
from the opto-electronic industry and visit related research and
education establishments in an effort to forge technology and
research cooperation agreements.</P>
      <P>Hartmann said he hopes to gain a full understanding of Taiwan's
development in the solar energy field and he voiced his hope that
Taiwan can serve as a springboard in Asia for Germany to conduct
technology and cooperation exchanges with countries in the region.</P>
      <P>The issue of how Taiwan explores, develops and exploits
alternative energy sources will be a key element in the government's
efforts to build the country into a "green Silicon Valley" free from
nuclear power. Germany has been promoting solar energy since the
1970s and has rich experience from which Taiwan can learn.</P>
      <P>At the invitation of the Ministry of Education, Hartmann arrived
in Taipei earlier the same day for a six-day visit. The trip is his
first to an Asian country in his capacity as IES CEO.</P>
      <P>While here, Hartmann will visit and give speeches at the

science-based industrial parks and various natural science museums

    <HEADLINE>TESTS FOR BOTULISM PATHOGEN AT BLACK-FACED SPOONBILL HABITAT CONTINUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Testing in the black-faced spoonbill's
habitat in southern Taiwan has revealed the presence of the botulism
pathogen in two out of the 16 sites tested, the Tainan County
Livestock Disease Control Center said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Following the death of 71 of the rare birds last year due to food
poisoning, the center began testing this June in the bird's main
habitat -- the Chiku wetlands at the mouth of Tsenwen River in Tainan
County -- for traces of the botulism pathogen.</P>
      <P>The center chose 10 sites at which to conduct tests every month
between June and August. Four of the black-faced spoonbill feeding
sites tested positive for the presence of the botulism pathogen.</P>
      <P>In September, the center increased the number of testing sites to
16. Among them, two tested positive, but the sites were near the
original four sites where the botulism pathogen was found to be
present.</P>
      <P>The officials said that after a site tests positive, the center's
countermeasures are usually to clear away the dead fish, shells and
shrimp in the area and turn the soil in order to let the sun kill off
the botulism pathogen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NUMBER OF CROSS-STRAIT MARRIAGES REACHES 190,000</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of cross-Taiwan Strait marriages
had reached 190,000 as of Oct. 8, according to tallies released by
the Immigration Bureau Thursday.</P>
      <P>Among these cross-strait couples, 171,582 mainland Chinese
spouses of Republic of China citizens had applied to visit Taiwan. Of
the applicants, 95,338 have been allowed to come to Taiwan for brief
visits; 13,149 have obtained residence permits; and 10,063 have
secured ROC citizenship.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the bureau received 2,963 applications between January
1992 and September 2003 for mainland Chinese spouses' next of kin to
come to Taiwan for family reunions. Among these, 1,579 applications
were approved, 782 were rejected, while the remaining 602 are still
awaiting approval based on quotas.</P>
      <P>To stave off an influx of mainland Chinese immigrants through
marriages of convenience, the National Police Administration (NPA)
implemented on Sept. 1 of this year a personal interview system for
incoming mainland Chinese spouses.</P>
      <P>As of Wednesday, 903 mainland Chinese spouses had been
interviewed either at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport -- the
main gateway to Taiwan -- or on the ROC-held frontline island of
Kinmen which lies closer to mainland China's Fujian Province than to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Thirteen of these, including 11 women and two men, were
determined to be in bogus marriages with ROC citizens and were
immediately repatriated, an NPA official said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the official said, 10 other mainland Chinese spouses
were determined, following a second round of interviewing after their
entry into Taiwan, to be in bogus marriages with ROC citizens.</P>
      <P>"We have invalidated their entry permits and ordered them to
leave the island within 10 days," he added.</P>
      <P>In the first nine months of this year, police authorities checked
into 1,079 cross-strait marriages and determined that 52 of them were
bogus.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Police Administration (NPA)
reported Thursday that a significant percentage of marriages between
mainland Chinese citizens and Taiwan residents have been discovered
to be bogus.</P>
      <P>NPA officials said that since they implemented on Sept. 1 the new
measure of conducting interviews with mainland Chinese coming to
Taiwan to visit their spouses, 903 spouses had been interviewed as of
Oct. 8, with 2.5 percent of the marriages having been found to be
bogus.</P>
      <P>The officials said 13 of the mainland spouses were determined to
be in bogus marriages with Taiwan citizens during the interviews
conducted at CKS International Airport or on the outlying island of
Kinmen, adding that the 13 were immediately repatriated.</P>
      <P>The officials have also conducted interviews with mainland
spouses already in Taiwan, concluding that 10 were in bogus
marriages. Their entry visas were revoked immediately, and they were
allowed 10 days to leave the island.</P>
      <P>The officials said that there are 190,000 Taiwan-mainland Chinese
married couples to date and that the number of mainland spouses who
have applied to come to Taiwan for visits and reunion has reached
95,338. Among them, 13,149 have obtained resident status, and 10,063
have received citizenship.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, legislators of the tiny opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) visited the NPA's Bureau of Immigration to observe the
interviewing process.</P>
      <P>Noting that there are only six immigration officials charged with
conducting the interviews, TSU Legislator Lo Jhih-ming urged the
government to establish an immigration agency with 500 staff and
proceed with full-scale interviews of all mainland Chinese spouses in
Taiwan.
TSU Legislator Chien Lin Hue-jyun also urged Taiwan women not to
get into bogus marriages with mainland Chinese men to help them come
to Taiwan to work legally, saying this is having a harmful effect on
Taiwan's system. She called for the women to think over their actions
and exercise self-restraint.</P>
      <P>Chien Lin further added that there have been many cases of

      <P>More than 1,000 overseas Chinese from the San Francisco Bay Area
celebrated the ROC national day at the San Francis Hotel with a
traditional lion dance.</P>
      <P>In line with the government's efforts to promote Taiwan after the
containment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) earlier in
the year, huge cloth banners printed with Taiwan landscapes were hung
at the entrance of the hotel, coupled with films showing Taiwan's
everyday street and country life.</P>
      <P>Lee Shih-ming, director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in San Francisco, addressed the occasion. He said Taiwan has
overcome many difficulties following the outbreaks of SARS with
assistance from Taiwan people both at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>Despite the problems, the government has been relentless in
promoting national development by encouraging foreign investors and
tourists to come to Taiwan. He said Taiwan's economy is expected to
grow by 3.2 percent this year, while outbound shipments in August
increased by 12.98 percent from the same month last year.</P>

back to Taiwan to gain a better understanding of their homeland.</P>

of Utah and Nevada also sent envoys to take part in the celebrations.</P>

Vatican on Double Ten Day, attracting more than 200 guests from the
Vatican government and the Chinese community.</P>
      <P>During the two-hour feast, a Taiwan folk dance was performed by a

featuring landscapes of the offshore Penghu Island were given away.</P>

      <P>The state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp.

    <HEADLINE>DOOR TO CROSS-STRAIT COOPERATION, PEACE ALWAYS OPEN: PRESIDENT CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that
the door to cooperation and peace between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait is always open.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in an address delivered at a rally at the
Presidential Office plaza marking the Republic of China's Double Ten
National Day.</P>
      <P>With a view to opening the door to cross-strait cooperation, Chen
said mainland China should put aside its "one China" and "one
country, two systems" political conditions.</P>
      <P>And in order to achieve cross-strait peace, Chen said, mainland
China should renounce its threat to resort to the use of force and
halt its strategic attempts to isolate Taiwan from the world.</P>
      <P>Chen said his administration has consistently adopted a firm and
pragmatic manner in promoting cross-strait relations. Even though
mainland China has not made an immediate goodwill response to his
three-phase plan for opening direct cross-strait transportation
links, Chen said he is convinced that trade and economic relations
between the two sides will enter a new stage after the next
presidential election in March 2004.</P>
      <P>As a national leader, Chen said, he must defend national
sovereignty, security and dignity as well as sustain Taiwan's
development.</P>
      <P>"The people of Taiwan must have confidence in their own strength
and their motherland, " Chen said, adding that only those who lack
self-confidence would compromise or even surrender to the other
side's barbaric demand to accept the "one China" principle as a
precondition for resumption of cross-strait dialogue. Beijing's "one
China" principle downgrades Taiwan to the status of a province under
mainland China's jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has managed to play an active role in the
international community not only because of its economic strength but
also due to its democratic reforms, Chen dismissed the claims by some
local politicians that Taiwan could have "greater room" on
the international stage should it accept the "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, Chen said, Taiwan would lose its
qualifications to join any international organization and would have
no place in global society should it give up its sovereign status and
democratic political system.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan has endured many setbacks in its pursuit of
freedom, democracy and prosperity and may face even more daunting
challenges in the future.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen said he firmly believes that freedom and
democracy will prevail and that the people of Taiwan will enjoy
lasting peace and prosperity.</P>
      <P>While celebrating the ROC's birthday, Chen said he most wants to
appeal for "faith in democracy, faith in reform and faith in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Chen further said signs of domestic economic recovery have become
ever more evident and stronger. Quoting concrete economic indicators
and evaluations by noted international market research firms, Chen
said the worst of the economic recession is over and that local
people will be able to experience the results of economic recovery in
the near future.</P>
      <P>Chen's speech kicked off the ROC's National Day celebrations in
front of the Presidential Office that included soldiers in shiny
chrome helmets, high school marching bands and dancers from the
African allies of Gambia and Malawi.</P>
      <P>Over 80,000 people attended the Double Ten Day rally, including
the presidents of Gambia and Malawi, other foreign
dignitaries, overseas Chinese community leaders and representatives
from all walks of life.</P>
      <P>The celebrations will continue in the evening with a "Faith in
Taiwan" party featuring multimedia and rock music performances, a
reception for foreign dignitaries and a dazzling fireworks display.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT PUSHES FOR WRITING OF NEW CONSTITUTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian made clear in his
National Day message Friday his determination to push for a new
constitution for Taiwan and solicited support and concerted efforts
from all walks of life to achieve this goal.</P>
      <P>Addressing a Double Ten National Day ceremony held at the
Presidential Office and attended by all major members of the
administration and legislative branches, Chen said that as the
tenth-term president of the Republic of China, he has a
responsibility to history.</P>
      <P>"I have an obligation to confront the important issue of
constitutional reform and unite our nation's 23 million people in
hastening the birth of a new constitution, so as to make Taiwan a
normal, full-fledged and great democracy," Chen said.</P>
      <P>"For constitutional reform to succeed, we must have the
integrated will of the people, a consensus among political parties,
and the participation of constitutional experts, " he said, adding
that all three factors are indispensable.</P>
      <P>He said his government shall not repeat the mistakes of past
administrations by allowing a single political party to dominate the
constitution amendment process.</P>
      <P>"In the end, the new constitution must be submitted as a national
referendum for the people of Taiwan to decide," he stressed.</P>
      <P>"I firmly believe that so long as we are unswerving in our
resolve to implement democratic reforms, and have confidence in the
people of Taiwan, the history of the 21st Century will show that our
future constitutional reforms will have been yet another major
triumph for Taiwan's democracy," Chen said.</P>
      <P>In his speech, titled "Faith in Democracy, Faith in Reform and
Faith in Taiwan, " Chen said that Taiwan in the new century is now
stepping across one invisible threshold after another. With the
passing of each arduous test, he said, Taiwan moves closer to the
final door of hope that leads to democracy, freedom, progress and
prosperity.</P>
      <P>"We have faith in Taiwan, because we have faith in the 23 million
people of Taiwan, because we have faith in democracy and faith in
reform," he said.</P>
      <P>"The power of a single person may not be able to change fate, but
the collective strength of all can necessarily rewrite history. So
long as every one of us has faith, I know we can do it, " he
continued.</P>
      <P>Chen said that if economic revitalization and comprehensive
reform -- two top priorities of the Administration that he proposed
at the beginning of this year -- are "the two sets of wheels
propelling Taiwan forward, then the re-engineering of Taiwan's
constitutional system is undoubtedly the body of the vehicle."</P>
      <P>Over the past few years, he said, the ruling and opposition
parties and the general public have repeatedly pointed out that the
current constitutional framework and the government system it
mandates are insufficient to meet Taiwan's practical needs. He
pointed out that past constitutional amendments were restricted by
special circumstances of time and environment, and were only able to
address specific issues through partial adjustments. Not only was it
impossible to realize a complete plan for a constitutional
government, but even more so, they left many problems unresolved,
thus seriously undermining the quality of Taiwan's democracy and the
efficiency of the government, he added.</P>
      <P>He said the goal of initiating economic revitalization and
comprehensive reform is to change Taiwan for the better and hence
provide better lives for the people. "Democratic reforms are like the
branches and trunk of a tree, while the leaves are the economy. We
must have both if Taiwan is to grow stout of limb and full of
foliage, and have prosperity and a better life for our people, " he
said.</P>
      <P>"From the perspective of economic revitalization, " he went on,
"the country has already seen a gradual series of exciting
achievements thanks to the concerted efforts of the government and the
people."</P>
      <P>"Since the beginning of this year," he continued, "both the stock
and real estate markets have grown steadily. Consumer spending grows
stronger by the day, while recent economic indicators have shown
`green light' growth for Taiwan's economy for two consecutive months,
and experts predict that the indicator will continue to show a green
light or better for the next half-year," he said.</P>
      <P>"Furthermore, Taiwan set two new records in terms of value for
overseas orders in July and August. All of these signs indicate that
Taiwan's economic recovery is gaining strength and momentum, " he
said, adding that in August of this year, "overseas investment in
Taiwan reached US$350 million, a new 10-month high, and many
international investment and evaluation institutions have also
recognized Taiwan's efforts and are optimistic about Taiwan's
potential.</P>
      <P>Rejuvenation of Taiwan's economy and international acclaim are
not mere coincidence. Rather, they are the achievements of the
coordinated and unheralded efforts of the government and people, " he
noted.</P>
      <P>"The government has worked hard to promote financial reforms and
deregulation, so as to further liberalize the economy, improve the
transparency of industry, and lower structural risks of industrial
operations, " he said, adding that "the goal is to strengthen the
infrastructure for economic development and create conditions
conducive to sustainable development in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>From the perspective of structural reforms, the deepening of
democracy is naturally the most important of the basic pursuits," the
president said.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years, he said, outstanding achievements have
been made in the establishment of truly nationalized armed forces,
the institutionalization of intelligence work, the protection of
fundamental human rights, the eradication of "black gold" politics,
and many other areas. "We firmly believe that the only way to ensure
an enhanced foundation for democracy is to completely sever the
intricate ties that sustain "black gold" politics, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>The president said that "the people have long pinned their
highest hopes on major reforms in areas such as education, the
judiciary, politics, finance and the media. These arena have now been
freed from the old fetters and constraints imposed by political
parties. The latitude of freedom and room for public discussion that
reforms ought to have has been restored.</P>
      <P>The government has proposed policies and launched actions in
response to public demands. We are confident that so long as
political parties can set aside selfish interests, accommodate the
diversity of public opinion and remain committed to democracy and
reform, then we can find the ideal path for carrying out all
reforms," Chen vowed.</P>
      <P>"I would like to re-emphasize that economic revitalization and
comprehensive reform represent two sides of the same coin. Only
steady and continuing implementation of reforms can sweep away the
accumulated ills of the past and allow us to quickly and effectively
promote the transformation and upgrade of Taiwan's political and
economic environment," he said.</P>

      <P>Hsia also stressed that Taiwan-U.S. relations are in their best

    <TEXT>The Straits Times: Clear signs of
economy improving.

The worst is over for the economy as new figures show it is
climbing out of the trough during the disastrous Sars months.
One per cent growth for the July-to-September quarter compared
to a year ago may not sound that wonderful, but it means the
economy has stopped shrinking.

The Lianhe Zaobao: Singapore economy rebounds but economists
cautious on outlook.

Singapore's economy rebounded in the third quarter after a
sharp SARS-led contraction in the second, according to new figures,
but analysts were cautious that the recovery is not broad-based.
Quarter-on-quarter growth of 15 per cent reversed an 11 per cent
downturn in the second quarter, the Ministry of Trade and Industry
(MTI) said, citing preliminary figures based on the economy's
performance in July and August.</TEXT>

(by EH)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Officials of Taiwan's ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and those of two major opposition parties
traded public comments Friday and Saturday on the issue of
constitutional reform.</P>
      <P>Lien Chan, presidential candidate of the "pan-blue alliance" of
the Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP), said Friday at an
evening party in Chiayi marking the Republic of China's Double Ten
National Day that, if elected president next year, he will hold
a conference on the development of a national constitution.</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-mai, a leader of the DPP caucus in the Legislative Yuan,
said Saturday that Lien is inconsistent on the issue of
constitutional reform, noting that he first dismissed President Chen
Shui-bian's idea to introduce a new constitution as "meaningless" and
then said Friday that he would hold a conference on the development
of a national constitution.</P>
      <P>President Chen first mentioned his idea to campaign for a new
constitution on Sept. 28 at a rally marking the 17th anniversary of
the founding of the DPP. In his national day address on Friday, Chen
also talked about the re-engineering of Taiwan's constitutional
system.</P>
      <P>He said that the current constitutional framework and the
government system it mandates are insufficient to meet Taiwan's
practical needs, and that he has an obligation to unite the Taiwan
people "in hastening the birth of a new constitution, so as to make
Taiwan a normal, full-fledged and great democracy." He also said that
"the constitution must be subject to a national referendum for the
people of Taiwan to decide."</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-mai said that the KMT has repeatedly boycotted the DPP's
initiatives for constitutional reform and that Lien is opposed to
constitutional reform.</P>
      <P>Kuo Su-chun, spokeswoman for the KMT, said that what Lien wants
to do is to hold a national conference on the amendment of the
constitution when it becomes "impractical."</P>
      <P>Kuo said what the KMT wants to do is to make "practical
amendments" to the constitution. The general public will be able to
see the difference between the ideas of the KMT and those of the DPP,
she added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin Cho-shui, executive director of the Policy
Committee of the DPP, said at a press conference Friday that the DPP
welcomes the idea of Lien holding a constitutional conference, but
added that this is not enough. The DPP hopes that Lien will put
forward a detailed proposal for constitutional reform, he said.</P>
      <P>Lin said there are similarities between the ideas of the KMT and
those of the DPP on constitutional reform.</P>
      <P>Chou Hsi-wei, convener of the PFP caucus in the Legislative Yuan,
said Friday that Lien's proposal to hold a constitutional conference
is feasible. He expressed the hope that both the ruling and
opposition parties will make public their detailed plans for
constitutional reform for open discussion.</P>
      <P>Chou also noted several points of similarity between the ideas of
the DPP and those of the pan-blue alliance on constitutional reform.</P>

      <P>The planning center for the agricultural

Oct. 12.</P>
      <P>The aim of the center will be to develop the park into the most

Agriculture (COA), will attend the ceremony.</P>
      <P>According to COA officials, local biotechnology companies are

      <P>In view of the fact that biotechnology is expected to be the star
industry with great potential this century, the government concluded
in the Economic Development Advisory Conference held in 2001 that the
island should establish an agricultural biotechnology park. The
government also listed biotechnology in its six-year national

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Saturday
that she will launch a campaign for sponsoring Malawian children so
that the children of the southeastern African country will get
better care.</P>
      <P>The vice president made the remarks when she hosted a luncheon in
Taoyuan County, northern Taiwan, in honor of Malawian President
Bakili Muluzi and his entourage who came to Taiwan for the Double Ten
National Day celebrations.</P>
      <P>Lu lauded President Muluzi for devoting himself to his country's
democracy and progress during his 10 years in office.</P>
      <P>She also said that President Muluzi is a long-term close friend
of Taiwan, noting that he has instructed the nation's ambassador to
the United Nations each year to speak out for the Republic of China's
cause when the United Nations holds its annual general assembly.</P>
      <P>Such steadfast support for the ROC is touching, the vice
president said.</P>
      <P>Lu said that some people in Taiwan may complain about the high
unemployment rate and the fact they are not earning enough money, but
compared with Malawi, "we are very lucky."</P>
      <P>She again urged the people to extend Taiwan's love to its
diplomatic allies. Following her appeal to sponsor Gambian children
earlier this week, she asked for generous donations for Malawian
children, saying that the sum of NT$10,000 (US$295.85) will be able
to support a child for two years.</P>
      <P>She said that she hopes the campaign could start from schools,
with groups of two or three students co-sponsoring a Malawian child.</P>
      <P>Lu also said that as Taiwan is actively seeking opportunities to
join the international community, it is necessary to extend Taiwan's
love to Malawi in addition to expressing its appreciation to the
country.</P>
      <P>After the luncheon, Lu accompanied President Muluzi and his
entourage to visit a chicken farm and a vegetable farm in Taoyuan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOOD EXPORTERS URGED TO OBTAIN MORE WORLD-LEVEL CERTIFICATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 11 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan officials and scholars on Saturday
urged exporters of agricultural products to obtain more world-level
certifications to boost their sales abroad.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics, Taiwan's agricultural exports
totalled US$2.51 billion for the first eight months of this year,
representing an increase of 4.3 percent over the same period last
year, with the main outlets being Japan, Hong Kong and United States.</P>
      <P>Chen Chia-ling, a section chief of the Council of Agriculture,
said that Taiwan's agricultural exports to Japan for the first eight
months rose 13.4 percent over the same period last year due largely
to Japan's stricter quality control on products from mainland China,
Taiwan's major competitor in the market.</P>
      <P>Last year, a large amount of vegetables and livestock products
exported to Japan from mainland China were found to contain excessive
levels of pesticides and antibiotics, leading the Japanese government
to increase the random examination rate on mainland Chinese
agricultural products from 5 percent to 20 percent, thus resulting in
a heavy decline in mainland Chinese agricultural exports to Japan
this year.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that although the quality of Taiwan's vegetables and
fruits is gradually being recognized in world markets, the island's
major outlets have been too concentrated in the United States and
Asian countries. He added that there is still much space for Taiwan
farmers to develop European and other American markets.</P>
      <P>To enlarge their market share, Chen urged domestic farmers to
gain more world level certifications, including the HACCP (Hazard
Analysis and Critical Control Point System), which is being promoted
by the World Trade Organization, the European Union and the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.</P>
      <P>Liao Yuan-tung, a professor at the National Pingtung University
of Science and Technology, noted that the HACCP should be adopted as
a standard by food entrepreneurs in Taiwan because most products
without HACCP certification will not be able to enter American,
European countries or Japan in the future.</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-tang, a China External Trade Development Council
official, said that people all around the world are becoming more and
more strict in terms of what they eat and are willing to spend more
money on high-quality food. He stressed that the image of "healthy,
safe and hygienic" food is an advantage that Taiwan agricultural
producers should explore for gaining a greater foothold in
international markets.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INTERVIEWS OF MAINLAND CHINESE SPOUSES EXPANDED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Immigration officers began to interview all
incoming mainland Chinese spouses of Taiwan citizens Saturday with a
view to staving off an influx of mainland immigrants through
marriages of convenience.</P>
      <P>With the number of bogus marriages between Taiwan and mainland
Chinese citizens increasing, the Bureau of Immigration under the
National Police Administration adopted a personal interview system
for incoming mainland spouses from the beginning of last month.</P>
      <P>Initially, the bureau only conducted personal interviews on
selected mainland Chinese spouses. As of Oct. 8, about 2.5 percent of
those interviewed were determined to be in bogus marriages with
Taiwan citizens and were either immediately repatriated or ordered to
leave the island in 10 days.</P>
      <P>On Friday, the bureau largely expanded interviews of incoming
mainland Chinese spouses and discovered three of them, including two
women and a man, to be in bogus marriages with Taiwan nationals for
the purpose of working on the island.</P>
      <P>Starting Saturday, the bureau launched an across-the-board
interview system at Chiang Kai-shek (CKS) International Airport --
the main gateway to Taiwan -- in order to prevent entry of mainland
citizens through marriages of convenience.</P>
      <P>The Aviation Police Bureau (APB) said it has dispatched 30 staff
members to assist immigration officers in interviewing all incoming
mainland Chinese spouses.</P>
      <P>"We believe that stricter entry control will help prevent an
influx of mainland immigrants through 'bogus marriages' and thus ward
off many social problems," an APB official said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Coast Guard Administration (CGA) said it will
intensify patrols and step up monitoring of mainland fishing boats
operating in waters near the center line of the Taiwan Strait to
prevent mainland Chinese citizens from illegally entering Taiwan by
ship.</P>
      <P>CGA officials said the Legislative Yuan's recent passage of a
package of amendments to the statute governing cross-Taiwan Strait
relations, which allows for confiscation of fishing boats used in
transporting illegal mainland immigrants to Taiwan and invalidation
of licenses of ships and crew members involved in the criminal
operations, will be of great help in discouraging or cracking down on
cross-strait human trafficking.</P>
      <P>The previous law didn't authorize law enforcement authorities to
seize those ships nor allow for revocation of law-breaking crewmen's
working licenses. As a result, mainland Chinese human smuggling ring
leaders, commonly known as snakeheads, often used Taiwan fishing
boats to smuggle mainland people to the island.</P>
      <P>According to official tallies, 903 mainland Chinese spouses
were interviewed either at CKS International Airport or on
the ROC-held frontline island of Kinmen between Sept. 1 and Oct.
8. Thirteen of these, including 11 women and two men, were
determined to be in bogus marriages with ROC citizens and were
immediately repatriated.</P>
      <P>Moreover, 10 other mainland Chinese spouses were determined,
following a second round of interviewing after their entry into
Taiwan, to be in bogus marriages with ROC citizens. Their entry
permits were revoked and ordered to leave the island within 10
days.</P>
      <P>In the first nine months of this year, police authorities checked
into 1,079 cross-strait marriages and determined that 52 of them were
bogus.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the number of cross-strait intermarriages had reached
190,000 as of Oct. 8. Among these cross-strait couples, 171,582
mainland Chinese spouses had applied to visit Taiwan. Of the
applicants, 95,338 have been allowed to come to Taiwan for brief
visits; 13,149 have obtained residence permits; and 10,063 have
secured ROC citizenship.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSU HAS MISUNDERSTOOD REVISED CROSS-STRAIT STATUTE: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The nation's top mainland China policy
planner said Saturday that the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) has misunderstood the "contents and spirit " of a just revised
statute and that it will continue to communicate with the party.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) was responding
to bitter attacks by the TSU the previous day after the revision to
the Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan
Area and the Mainland Area was passed by the Legislative Yuan Thursday.</P>
      <P>The TSU claimed that since the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
took power in May 2000, it has allowed more than 80,000 mainland
Chinese spouses to come to Taiwan, surpassing the figure for the
whole preceding decade.</P>
      <P>The TSU also said that it is worried that a large influx of
mainland Chinese spouses could dilute valuable social resources
and even trigger an economic collapse, adding that the government's
"wrong policy" will only bring disaster to the nation.</P>
      <P>MAC officials said that although cross-strait intermarriages have
increased in recent years, only about 11,000 mainland spouses have
been given approval to settle in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>They said that in the first two years after marriage, mainland
Chinese citizens will only be allowed to visit their spouses in
Taiwan, and only for a maximum of six months at one time.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the visiting mainland Chinese spouses are
only short-term migrants and that they have not been entitled to
social benefits.</P>
      <P>They said that the newly revised statute will follow the
principle of making it "easier for mainland people to live in Taiwan,
but more difficult for them to obtain citizenship."</P>
      <P>They said that following the revision, the related government
agencies now have the comprehensive legal basis to control and manage
the newly-arrived population and to take their impact on Taiwan
society into account.</P>
      <P>Consequently, the newly-revised statute will set the quota in
view of Taiwan's population growth, the distribution of social
resources, social stability and immigration policy, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>Addressing the TSU's criticism of the government for allowing
mainland-based educational institutions to recruit students in
Taiwan, MAC officials said that this was a "necessary adjustment in
line with the regulations of the World Trade Organization (WTO) , "
which they said does not mean "an opening will be imminent."</P>
      <P>The officials said that Taiwan and mainland China have yet to
conduct bilateral negotiations on the issue under the framework of
the WTO.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Ministry of Education will have to further
assess the impact on Taiwan's education system if mainland
educational institutions are allowed to recruit students in Taiwan,
they added.</P>
      <P>Therefore, they said that the MAC will "not allow mainland
educational institutions to do so at this stage, and that there is no
possibility of formulation of approval measures in the short term,"
adding that the TSU has misunderstood the revised regulations and
worried too much.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian and visiting
Gambian President Yahya Jammeh signed a joint communique Saturday,
reaffirming their commitment to further promoting cooperation between
the two countries.</P>
      <P>The two leaders also expressed their willingness to work
hand-in-hand in promoting world peace and prosperity.</P>
      <P>In the communique, Jammeh reaffirmed his country's support for
the Republic of China's bid to join major international
organizations, including the United Nations and the World Health
Organization.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chen extended his gratitude for Gambia's staunch
support for Taiwan's cause and reassured Jammeh of the ROC's
commitment to assist in Gambia's economic development.</P>
      <P>Before signing the joint communique, Chen and Jammeh held talks
on matters of mutual concern. This is Jammeh's fourth visit to Taiwan
in his capacity as the Gambian head of state and the first time he
has taken part in the ROC's Double Ten National Day celebrations.</P>
      <P>Chen told Jammeh that he was impressed by the dance performances
by a Gambian troupe at an ROC National Day rally Friday.</P>
      <P>"The dazzling performances not only epitomized Gambia's cultural
essence but also brought exotic fanfare to our National Day
festivities," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen further said he is aware that the Gambian Presidential
Office's Web site has been linked up with those of eight other
countries around the world, including the ROC's.</P>
      <P>"The fact that our Web site comes just behind the White House's
indicates the importance Gambia attaches to its ties with Taiwan, "
Chen said, adding that he hopes the two countries will strengthen
bilateral communications and exchanges through this channel.</P>
      <P>As Gambia is focusing efforts on developing its agriculture, Chen
said the ROC has prepared high-quality seeds of several tropical
fruit and peanut varieties for Jammeh's entourage to take back to the
West African state for plantation.</P>
      <P>"I earnestly hope that these seeds can grow well in your country
to let your people get a taste of the delicious fruits endemic to
Taiwan," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Jammeh, who arrived in Taipei Wednesday in the company of some
senior Gambian officials, wrapped up his four-day visit and
left for home Saturday afternoon.</P>
      <P>In addition to attending the ROC's National Day celebrations,
Jammeh has also visited major Taiwan economic establishments during
his stay, including the state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp.'s (CPC's)
oil refinery in Taoyuan. While there, Jammeh invited CPC Chairman Kuo
Chin-tsai to head a delegation to visit his country later this month

Foreign ambassadors and diplomats in the Philippines
have expressed confidence in the country's handling of
security situations despite a warning of the
Australian government that the Philippines is a likely
target of Southeast Asian terrorist network Jemaah
Islamiyah (JI).

The Philippine Daily Inquirer: RP open target but

PRESIDENT Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo said Friday the
Philippines could prevent attacks by the Jemaah
Islamiyah terror network after an Australian official
warned that the country faced the "greatest threat" of
an attack in the region.

The Philippine Star: Lakas-NPC alliance tried and

This was the sentiment expressed by Speaker Jose de
Venecia, Lakas-CMD party president, two days after the

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The nation's top economic planning agency
issued a report Saturday forecasting that Taiwan's economic growth
for this year will reach 3.06 percent.</P>
      <P>According to the report by the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD), Taiwan's economic growth for the first half of
the year was slow because of the impacts of the U.S.-led war against
Iraq in March and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
outbreak in Taiwan between March and June.</P>
      <P>With the end of the war in Iraq and the containment of SARS, CEPD
officials said, Taiwan's economy has visibly turned for the better in
the second half of the year, and the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) has adjusted its economic growth
forecast for the second half of the year to 4.32 percent and its
growth forecast for 2003 to 3.06 percent.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS had originally estimated that Taiwan's economic growth
would be 2.89 percent for this year.</P>
      <P>The CEPD officials also said that the consumer price index (CPI),
which fell by 0.2 percent last year, has continued to drop this year.
The CPI for the first nine months of this year was down 0.31 percent
over that for the same period last year.</P>
      <P>The officials said that they don't think that this indicates that
deflation has set in, adding however that they will continue to
monitor the situation closely.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mao Zedong would be turning in his grave if
he knew that the leaders in Beijing were doing all they could to
block Taiwan independence, according to a book authored by Yao
Chia-wen, president of the Examination Yuan.</P>
      <P>In the book, "Ten Remarks that Affect Taiwan," Yao quoted Mao as
saying in Edgar Snow's 1938 book, "Red Star over China, " that he
firmly supported the Korean people's fight for independence from
Japan, who ruled the Korean Peninsula at the time, and by the same
token, supported the Taiwan people's fight against Japan for a
similar cause.</P>
      <P>Even Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the Republic of China,
would have welcomed Taiwan's independence, said Yao in his book,
citing Tai Chi-tao, one of Sun's confidants and a former president of
the Control Yuan, as quoting Sun as saying that Taiwan should have
its own government and parliament.</P>
      <P>Tai was, therefore, one of the earliest advocates for Taiwan
independence, Yao said in his new book.</P>
      <P>Yao counts late Minister of Foreign Affairs George Yeh and late
Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Yang Shi-kun among the supporters of
Taiwan independence, saying that declassified information shows both
Yeh and Yang flirted with the idea of Taiwan independence to thwart
Beijing's territorial claims on Taiwan in 1971 when the Republic of
China's seat at the United Nations was taken over by the People's
Republic of China.</P>

communist countries are in Asia.</P>
      <P>There is no cooperation framework for Asian nations due to
cultural differences and longstanding conflicts, she noted, adding
that to actively promote democracy in the region by taking the
experiences of democratization of the region's democratic countries
as reference and to promote regional economic, cultural and

    <HEADLINE>INTERNATIONAL CHARTER FLIGHT SERVICES VIA KINMEN ARE FEASIBLE: CAA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Oct.  12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Operating international charter flight
services from Kinmen's Shangyi Airport would not only be pragmatic,
but feasible, according to the head of the Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA) Sunday.</P>
      <P>CAA Director-General Chang Kuo-cheng said in Kinmen that he
supports the proposal made by Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng that
Kinmen's Shangyi Airport be allowed to operate international charter
flight services to increase the service for mainland China-based
Taiwanese business people and overseas Chinese who are interested in
visiting Kinmen.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen Shangyi Airport is currently being expanded and could
accept international flights in two years, making it suitable for
international charter flight services, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the primary concern of any international airport
is its ability to attract passengers. "Therefore, as long as Shangyi
Airport can get enough passengers and international air carriers are
willing to operate flights to and from Kinmen, the airport's
international charter flight services should be fine," he said.</P>
      <P>Kinmen County Magistrate Lee said Sunday that Kinmen -- the
hometown of hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese scattered
throughout Southeast Asia -- should be allowed to operate
international charter flight services beginning with a once-a-week
international charter flight connecting Kinmen's Shangyi Airport and
Singapore's Changyi International Airport.</P>
      <P>The Shangyi-Changyi charter flights would make it easier for
Chinese expats to return home to Kinmen, and would make it more
convenient for potential investors from Southeast Asia to come to
Kinmen, thus rejuvenating Kinmen's tourism sector and boosting its
economic development, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee also asked that entry procedures for overseas Chinese
traveling to Kinmen via Xiamen in Fujian province be further
simplified to facilitate travel to Kinmen by those people who have
already traveled to southern mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chang and other CAA officials went to Kinmen Sunday to preside
over a shellfish farming event on the Kinmen coast, where clam and
oyster farming was destroyed by pollution caused by the dumping of
waste soil retrieved from the Shangyi Airport reconstruction work in
May this year.</P>
      <P>The CAA financed the acquisition of some 1.5 million clam "seed
stock." About 200 people, including CAA officials, personnel from the
Kinmen County Government, and several Kinmen County councilors walked
to the beach to "plant" the baby clams in the hope that the marine
ecology in the Kinmen area will be nurtured back to health.</P>

      <P>Republic of China nationals living and

service from Taiwan's representative offices, Minister of Foreign
Affairs Eugene Chien said in a written report submitted to the
Legislative Yuan Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chien said his ministry has required its foreign-based offices to
enhance service and assistance to those ROC citizens holding the new
ROC passport with the word "Taiwan" on the cover in the face of
robust pressure from Beijing, which has demanded that foreign
countries deny entry or departure to travelers from Taiwan holding
the new passport.</P>
      <P>The word "Taiwan" was added to help foreign customs authorities
better distinguish ROC passports from those of the People's Republic

      <P>Applications for the new passport increased by 21 percent during
the period from its issuance day on Sept. 1 to Sept. 25 over the

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WTO ENVOY SPEAKS OUT FOR CONTINUATION OF DOHA ROUND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's permanent representative to the
World Trade Organization (WTO) announced Monday that the country will
continue to back multilateral trade talks initiated in the WTO's Doha
Round negotiations.</P>
      <P>According to Yen Ching-chang, supporting sound multilateral trade
talks under the framework of the WTO is in the country's best trade
and economic interests.</P>
      <P>Yen made the remarks during a meeting called by WTO General
Council Chairman Carlos Perez del Castillo earlier the same day with
a dozen WTO-based permanent envoys to discuss feasible measures to
reopen the Doha Round following the collapse of talks held in
mid-September in Cancun, Mexico. The meeting was held prior to an
unofficial envoy-level meeting slated for the next day.</P>
      <P>Despite the setback at the Cancun talks, Castillo stressed the
goal of accomplishing the Doha Round negotiations by the end of 2004
and he called for member states to do their best to help rekindle the
negotiations.</P>
      <P>Echoing Castillo's statement, Yen said the failure of the Cancun
talks should not be interpreted as a blockage to the Doha Round
negotiations and the WTO should not be regarded as an "international
court" aimed at resolving trade disputes.</P>
      <P>Taiwan firmly supports the reopening of the Doha Round
negotiations and the WTO's traditional role in holding trade
regulatory talks, he said.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that bilateral and multilateral trade agreements
will quickly emerge in different regions in the wake of the Cancun
talks, the envoy said Taiwan will be soon put in a very difficult
position amid such circumstances.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he went on, participating in WTO-sponsored
multilateral trade talks would create the maximum benefits for
Taiwan, while supporting the resumption of the Doha Round talks and
backing the WTO's leadership role in international trade mechanisms
will also help the country to protect its business interests.</P>
      <P>To help toward the goal, Taiwan will be more reserved about the
more controversial agricultural issues, while adopting a more
positive stance in pushing for a consensus on the so-called Singapore
issue -- market opening, regulatory affairs, improvement in
transparency in government contracts and simplified procedures for
cross-boarder transportation -- he added.</P>
      <P>The unofficial envoy-level meeting to be held Tuesday will be the
first gathering of member states since the breakup of the Cancun
talks.</P>
      <P>The Cancun meeting, a follow-up called to discuss a pact reached
in the 2001 WTO conference in Doha, Qatar, broke up as a result of
sharp differences between the rich and the poor countries over the
Singapore issue.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Monday
that Taiwan should not be left out and become marginalized during the
economic integration of the countries of East Asia.</P>
      <P>Ma, who arrived in Singapore to attend the 12th East Asia

after his arrival.</P>
      <P>Ma said he attended the meeting mainly to highlight the

added that the people of Taiwan are very concerned about the regional
economic integration and are unwilling to see Taiwan left out and
marginalized in the integration process.</P>
      <P>"After all, Taiwan has made a substantial contribution to the
economic development of East Asia and has its own unique stance, " Ma
said.</P>
      <P>He explained that as Taipei's mayor, he is nevertheless concerned
about issues that involve the nation because as the capital, Taipei's
industrial and service sectors will both be affected if Taiwan is
marginalized.</P>
      <P>Ma is scheduled to deliver a speech on the growth of mainland

      <P>American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
Chairwoman Therese Shaheen arrived in Taipei Monday for a weeklong

      <P>This is Shaheen's first visit to Taiwan since assuming the AIT

      <P>Upon her arrival at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport,

    <HEADLINE>MUTUAL SELF-RESTRAINT ONLY HOPE FOR CROSS-STRAIT TIES: KMT CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By N.K. Han and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mutual self-restraint is the only way to
maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait until the two sides can find a
more effective political and legal framework to address their
disputes, a visiting Taiwan opposition leader said in London Sunday.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening session of a Cambridge
University-sponsored seminar on regional security, opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan said that while the United States
has played an important role in maintaining peace and stability in
East Asia over the past few decades, self-restraint shown by the
countries in the region should also be credited for the achievement.</P>
      <P>For example, Lien said, the Taiwan Strait has remained largely
peaceful over the past several decades because the two sides have
exercised self-restraint. Against that backdrop, he went on, mainland
China has been able to carry out market reforms and Taiwan has
managed to enjoy economic prosperity, to withstand two oil crises and
an Asian financial fiasco, and to complete its democratization
process.</P>
      <P>However, Lien said the self-restraint has gradually weakened
since the mainland conducted a series of live-fire military exercises
and test-fired missiles into the Taiwan Strait in the run-up to the
island's first-ever direct presidential election in 1996.</P>
      <P>More worrisome to him, Lien said, is that three adverse
tendencies have emerged since the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
took power in Taiwan in May 2000.</P>
      <P>According to Lien, the three adverse developments are mainland
China's intensified military buildup, Taiwan's prolonged economic
doldrums and what he said is the DPP administration's failure to
adopt a more prudent and moderate approach in dealing with
cross-strait affairs.</P>
      <P>Lien, who will team up with opposition People First Party
Chairman James Soong to challenge President Chen Shui-bian's
re-election bid in the 2004 presidential election, said if he wins
next year, his administration, while countering Beijing's military
threat and political pressure, will avoid provoking the mainland, in
order to maintain regional peace and stability.</P>
      <P>Lien, a former vice president, arrived in London Saturday for a
speaking tour in the company of Legislative Yuan Vice President P.K.
Chiang and several former ROC officials.</P>

job at National Cheng Kung University in Tainan, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"For the simple reasons that I have high blood pressure and have
accomplished my mission at this stage, " Hsu said, referring to his
part in bringing the company's revenue from red into the black, as
well as his hand in helping with the company's approaching goal of
privatization.</P>
      <P>Hsu denied reports that he was bailing out of the company or that
there were political considerations behind his decision.</P>
      <P>He was responding to reports speculating that as a
second-generation mainland Chinese, he is worried about having to
take sides in next year's presidential election.</P>
      <P>The mass-circulation China Times also claimed that a policy to
build submarines for the nation's military -- which has not received
clear support from the government -- coupled with an as-yet-realized
promise by the Executive Yuan to appropriate NT$2 billion (US$59.3
million) to improve the financial structure of the CSBC have also
contributed to discouraging Hsu and making him want to return to
teaching.</P>
      <P>The reports noted that the CSBC is being privatized and is
scheduled to sell its Keelung and Kaohsiung plants, and that MPH, a
consortium of arms manufacturers in the United States, is interested
in bidding for the Kaohsiung plant and is sending an official to
Taiwan this week to discuss the matter with the CSBC.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that this May he had been extremely busy and that he was
preoccupied with communications with the MPH and other parties
interested in investing in the CSBC. Because of time zone
differences, he often had to work at night, which caused his blood
pressure to shoot up dramatically.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Lin Hsin-i, who concurrently serves as the chairman
of the nation's top economic agency, the Council for Economic
Planning and Development, said that Hsu had expressed his wish to
return to teaching several months ago, but said the Ministry of
Economic Affairs which is in charge of administrating all
state-owned enterprises, is hoping to "retain him as best we can."</P>
      <P>Last year, the CSBC was involved in a fraud scandal that led
then-Chairman Yu Chang-nan to step down. Hsu was invited to take over
his job and he vowed at the time to get the company out of the red
quickly.</P>
      <P>Statistics provided by the Commission of National Corporations
show that the accumulated losses of the CSBC reached NT$11 billion at
one time and the company was on the brink of bankruptcy in 2001.
After the implementation of a rejuvenation plan, the CSBC turned the
corner last year, recording pre-tax profits of NT$350 million.</P>
      <P>Since international shipping is on the rebound, the CSBC has
earned profits of nearly NT$300 million in the first eight months of
this year, and is forecast to record profits of NT$360 million for
the whole year.</P>
      <P>Orders for new vessels have reached more than 40, which will keep
the company fully booked until 2007.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI COUNTY WARNS AGAINST HIRING ILLEGAL FOREIGN WORKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei County Labor Affairs Bureau
warned local employers Monday not to hire illegal foreign workers or
those on the run, or face fines of at least of NT$150,000 (US$4,477).</P>
      <P>The bureau issued the warning in response to the fact that a
number of such cases were recently discovered in the county. It
stressed that employers must verify the identity of any foreign
workers they plan to hire beforehand.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau, one of the latest cases concerned an
Indonesian worker, who turned herself in to the bureau and accused
her boss of holding on to her salary and her passport.</P>
      <P>However, the bureau and police discovered that the woman's broker
had lied to the authorities that she had absconded from her previous
job and he then got her various other jobs working illegally in the
cities of Panchiao and Hsintien, as well as in neighboring Taipei
City.</P>
      <P>According to police, the woman had originally been hired by a
local woman surnamed Yu to take care of her elderly and sick father.
But Yu's father died before the woman arrived in Taiwan, so Yu told
the broker that she could not hire the woman and instructed the broker
to make sure the woman was sent back to Indonesia.</P>
      <P>However, the broker failed to report the case to the Council of
Labor Affairs (CLA) , but said instead that the woman had absconded,
which allowed him to assign her illegal jobs.</P>
      <P>When the case came to light, the woman was repatriated and banned
from entering Taiwan again, while the boss found to have illegally
hired her was fined NT$150,000.</P>
      <P>The bureau warned local employers verify the identity of
potential foreign hires before employing them. When the contract
expires, the employer must instruct the broker report the case to the
CLA to help the foreign worker legally transfer to a new job or leave
Taiwan, it said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO LOSE COMPETITIVE EDGE IF DRAGGING FEET ON REFORM: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday if
Taiwan drags its feet on sweeping reforms, it will lose its
competitive edge and its sustainable development will also be at
stake.</P>
      <P>Chen issued the warning at a ceremony marking the inauguration of
a preparatory office for a planned independent agency to regulate
telecommunications and broadcasting services.</P>
      <P>Noting that the time has changed, Chen said, many existing
concepts, systems and regulations, including the constitutional
framework, have become obsolete.</P>
      <P>"We need to make an overall review to determine whether our
existing institutions and rules should be updated and how the reforms
should be carried out," Chen said, adding that if Taiwan fails to
take swift reform steps, it won't be able to maintain its niches in
the highly competitive global market.</P>
      <P>With fast progress and popularization of digital technology, Chen
said, previous concepts and supervisory provisions for
communications and broadcasting services can no longer meet the
market demand.</P>
      <P>"Many advanced countries have thus adjusted their regulatory
organizations, policies and operational rules to cope up
the prevailing trend of integration of Internet, television and
mobile communication services," Chen said.</P>
      <P>In line with this trend, he said, the government has decided to
to enact a new communications and broadcasting basic law and set up
a "National Communications Commission" to administer and supervise all
telecommunications and TV broadcasting services.</P>
      <P>"The moves are aimed at creating an environment for fair
competition among local operators, enhancing their competitiveness in
the world market, upgrading the service quality and better
protecting consumers' rights," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said the government has already referred to the Legislative
Yuan a draft communications and broadcasting services basic bill and a
draft National Communications Commission organic bill for approval.</P>
      <P>"I earnestly hopes that the opposition-controlled legislature can
pass the two bills as early as possible to facilitate a necessary
overhaul of our telecommunications and broadcasting services
regulatory systems and operational rules," Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to his administration's six-year "Challenge 2008"
national development plan, Chen said, the government will boost the
development of information and communication technologies and expand
the number of broadband subscribers to 6 million in six years.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the draft organic bill, the National
Communications Commission will integrate several existing
government agencies, including the Directorate General of
Telecommunications and the Government Information Office's
broadcasting and television department.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT THREATENS TO SUE PRESIDENT CHEN AFTER HE STEPS DOWN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Sept.  13  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is
consulting with lawyers to sue President Chen Shui-bian after over
his claims that Beijing is secretly helping the KMT and People First
Party (PFP) in the 2004 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Tsai Cheng-yuan, a spokesman for the KMT, said the charge will be
brought against Chen after May 20 next year when he fails to win
re-election and steps down from the presidency, as the law shelters
the president from any legal charges except for treason and sabotage.</P>
      <P>Tsai said more than 10 lawyers have agreed to take the case
jointly.</P>
      <P>The spokesman made the remarks after KMT Chairman Lien Chan, who
is on a tour of Europe, challenged the president earlier in the day
in London to come up with evidence to substantiate an accusation he
made in an interview with the Washington Post.</P>
      <P>Chen's office didn't respond to the KMT's threats, but officials
and lawmakers of his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) have come out
to defend the president.</P>
      <P>DPP Deputy Secretary-General Lee Ying-yuan said Beijing is not
helping the KMT and PFP secretly; rather, it is helping them openly.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yi-ching, director for the DPP's Department for Women's
Affairs said KMT and PFP supporters solicited votes from the two
parties at a dinner party hosted recently by officials of Fujian
province for Taiwan businessmen working there.</P>
      <P>Another KMT spokesman, Chou Sho-hsun, dismissed the claims as
groundless, saying that what certain Taiwan businessmen do has
nothing to do with the KMT.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Chen Ching-chun, citing what he called much common
ground in the views of Beijing and the two opposition parties,
ridiculed the KMT and the PFP as "a blind person eating dumplings
knows in his mind what it is."</P>
      <P>Chen gave the interview in Taipei on Oct. 6. The Washington Post
published the full text of the interview Saturday after Chen's office
denied part of a story based on the interview published Oct. 7 by the
Post.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION NOT INDISPENSABLE PREREQUISITE: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that
referendum legislation is not necessarily a prerequisite for holding
referendums on major public policy issues.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with five scholars and
experts from the United States, Germany, Switzerland and Sweden who
are currently in Taipei to attend an international seminar on direct
democracy and popular rights to initiative and referendum.</P>
      <P>While referendums have been implemented in Western countries for
many years as a form of direct democracy and have even become part of
their daily lives, Chen said, referendums largely remain taboo in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For example, Chen told his guests that his administration's plan
to hold a referendum either before or on the day of the nation's next
presidential election -- March 20, 2004 -- on the fate of the
controversial Fourth Nuclear Power Plant and several other public
issues has drawn mixed reactions and even triggered heated debate.</P>
      <P>To the best of his understanding, Chen said, not all countries
that have allowed their people to exercise their right to a
referendum have enacted a law to regulate relevant procedures.</P>
      <P>"Many countries have held referendums on the introduction of new
constitutions or constitutional amendments, and one thing is clear
that not all of them have legislated a referendum law, " Chen
explained.</P>
      <P>In his view, Chen said, people's right to vote in a referendum
should take precedence over referendum legislation by their elected
representatives.</P>
      <P>Noting that a nation's power comes from its people, Chen said if
the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan, while insisting on the
need of legislating a referendum bill as a prerequisite for holding a
referendum, drags its feet on completing such legislation, the people
of Taiwan should be allowed to hold a referendum on whether such a
bill is needed and what its provisions should be.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATORS URGE GOVERNMENT TO REVIEW DIPLOMATIC DIRECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several legislators said Monday that the
Republic of China need not feel bad about severing diplomatic ties
with Liberia, but they urged the government to review its diplomatic
direction.</P>
      <P>The legislators made the remarks at the Legislative Yuan in the
wake of the Republic of China's breaking off of diplomatic relations
with the West African state of Liberia.</P>
      <P>Former Minister of Foreign Affairs and legislator of the
opposition Kuomintang John Chang said that one should not feel sad
about breaking with Liberia, but he criticized the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) for blaming everything on mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chang said that MOFA's relations with many African countries have
often hinged on a single man, and he pointed out that many African
national leaders are selfish, thinking only of themselves.</P>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene Chien said that although the
Republic of China's relations with 26 countries are stable, some
relations may change, adding that the opposition party in El Salvador
has said that if they are in power, they will sever ties with the
ROC.</P>
      <P>Chang questioned Chien's words that the ROC's diplomatic
relations with the remaining 26 allies are stable, saying that "a lot
of them are in danger."</P>
      <P>Legislator Hsiao Bi-khim of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party also said that if a country only wants things from Taiwan, then
such a diplomatic relation is not worthwhile, especially because
former Liberian President Charles Taylor is a war criminal and has a
bad international image.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, Taiwan does not look bad by severing ties with such a
country, " she said, adding that the nation should instead make
efforts to maintain relations with countries like Senegal, which have
better images.</P>
      <P>Legislator Parris Chang of the DPP said: "Trading off diplomatic
relations with economic assistance is no breakthrough in terms of
diplomatic work, " adding that to establish diplomatic relations with
countries in Scandinavia and Western Europe will be significant.</P>
      <P>Chang reiterated that he had not advocated establishing
diplomatic relations just for the sake of adding more "diplomatic
allies" since the DPP government came to power in May 2000.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Sun Kuo-hua suggested the passing of a resolution
to condemn mainland China for pressuring Liberia to break its ties
with the ROC, using its stance in the United Nations' Security
Council.</P>
      <P>He also asked MOFA to come up with countermeasures and asked how
the ministry is going to settle bad loans with Liberia.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) is offering 18 investment projects for foreign
investors to allow foreign capital and technologies access into
Taiwan's infrastructure development, a ranking MOTC official said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Transportation and Communications Chang Chia-chu
said the 18 investment projects -- including the development of
exclusive areas of the soon-to-be-built high-speed railway,
electronic toll booths along freeway systems, and the electrical
engineering work in the planned MRT system connecting Taipei City and
Chiang Kai-shek International Airport -- will allow foreign companies
opportunities to cooperate with local businesses in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang denied allegations made by opposition People First Party
(PFP) Legislator Lee Hung-jun that all those 18 investment projects
are only "money-making" opportunities for foreign companies, rather
than "investment opportunities" which will in turn benefit economic
and industrial development in Taiwan in the long run.</P>
      <P>The 18 investment projects that the MOTC offered also include the
development of an air cargo transportation complex in Taoyuan near
the Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, the building of a freeway
system in eastern Taiwan, the development of the Peiyi Freeway
connecting Taipei and the eastern county of Ilan, the expansion of
Keelung, Taichung and Kaohsiung international seaports and the
building of warehouse districts on those three areas, as well as the
development of five new tourist attractions around the island.</P>
      <P>The MOTC made the offer in line with a series of investment
projects that the Executive Yuan has recently mapped out to be
formally announced during an investment promotion conference -- the
2003 Taiwan Business Alliance Conference -- slated to take place Oct.
19-22.</P>
      <P>The high-profile international symposium -- aimed at prompting a
worldwide wave of investment in Taiwan to help improve infrastructure
and increase the country's investment incentives -- is being
sponsored by the Executive Yuan and organized jointly by the Ministry
of Economic Affairs, the China External Trade Development Council and

      <P>Ma made the remarks prior to his departure for Singapore to

      <P>As ASEAN member economies and major East Asian countries,

    <HEADLINE>TIME TO REVAMP CONSTITUTION HAS COME: CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The time has come for the nation to revamp
the ROC Constitution to meet the practical needs of Taiwan society
and deepen the country's democratization, President Chen Shui-bian
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>As the president of the Republic of China, Chen said, it is his
duty and responsibility to come up with a comprehensive plan on
constitutional reform for the people to concertedly review and pave
the way for the birth of a new constitution, Chen said during a
speech at the National Central Library.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of the International Conference on
Government Reform and the Civil Service System, Chen said that a
nationwide referendum will be held later this year or early next year
for the people to vote on whether to write and implement a new
constitution.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the existing ROC Constitution came out of a
different political and social era of instability and was designed to
unite the 490 million Chinese people of the time. He said it has for
long been unsuitable for Taiwan and its people, prompting him to push
for a new one to better cope with the present realities.</P>
      <P>Over the past few years, he said, the ruling and opposition
parties and the general public have repeatedly pointed out that the
current constitutional framework and the government system it
mandates are insufficient to meet Taiwan's practical needs.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that past constitutional amendments were
restricted by special circumstances of the time and environment, and
were only able to address specific issues through partial
adjustments. Not only was it impossible to realize a complete plan
for a constitutional government, but even more so, many problems were
left unresolved, thus seriously undermining the quality of Taiwan's
democracy and the efficiency of the government, he added.</P>
      <P>While working on rewriting the constitution, Chen said, matters
pertaining to the limits of government power, the roles of the
central and local governments, basic human rights and fundamental
national policies will all be examined and discussed.</P>
      <P>About 250 academics and government officials are taking part in
the International Conference on Government Reform and Civil Service
System sponsored by the Examination Yuan.</P>
      <P>Two dignitaries from abroad have been invited to deliver keynote
speeches during the two-day conference. Professor Deborah R. Hensler
from Stanford University's law school is scheduled to speak on the
subject of "Examination and Selection System of Legal Professionals,"
while Dr. Udo Bartsch, president of the Federal Academy of Public
Administration of Germany's Federal Ministry of the Interior, is
slated to speak on the topic of "Senior Civil Servant Training
System," according to the sponsor.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Direct trade, transport and postal links
will be set up in a foreseeable future between Taiwan and mainland
China, visiting American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairwoman Therese
Shaheen predicted Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Giving a speech on Taiwan's economic future to members of the
American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei, Shaheen said that the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait will eventually come up with feasible
measures to open the links for their mutual benefit, because "money
talks."</P>
      <P>In addition, the mainland authorities will know the timing for
when best to conduct negotiations with Taiwan if President Chen
Shui-bian succeeds in his re-election bid next year, Shaheen said.</P>
      <P>Describing Taiwan as "the tailor for mainland China's economy, "
Shaheen hailed the island's remarkable contributions to the economic
development of the mainland and the rest of Asia, and attributed the
mainland's expanding economic clout in part to Taiwan's steady
investment.</P>
      <P>Turning to the issue of Taiwan's efforts to protect U.S.
intellectual property rights (IPR) , the AIT chief said she does not
expect that Taipei will move toward greater improvements in this
regard, as all eyes will be on the approaching presidential election
of next March.</P>
      <P>Taiwan must display greater commitment to IPR protection and to
the implementation of its obligations under the World Trade
Organization (WTO), she said.</P>
      <P>"In addition to the faithful implementation of its WTO
obligations, Taiwan also needs to continue to liberalize trade in
goods and services as well as insure the highest level of IPR
protection and enforcement, " she noted.</P>
      <P>But she stressed that Washington will ask Taipei in strong terms
to step up its IPR efforts after the presidential race has ended.</P>
      <P>In the face of the mainland's fast economic development, Shaheen
said she is optimistic about Taiwan's economic prospects and
contended that Taiwan will know very well which path to take in its
interaction with the mainland.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, she also warned that Taiwan could encounter harsh
economic challenges in the coming 15 or 20 years as the mainland
economy increases in stature and weight, should a significant
economic recovery be absent in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The United States stands ready and willing to listen to Taiwan's
concerns as it moves along this path and assist where possible, to
help revitalize Taiwan's economy and restore Taiwanese
self-confidence," she concluded.</P>
      <P>The top U.S. liaison official in charge of Taiwan affairs arrived
Monday in Taipei for a week-long visit. It is her first visit to
Taiwan since she assumed the post late last year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VETERAN ECONOMIST UNVEILS STRATEGY FOR IMPROVING TAIWAN ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  Oct.  13  (CNA)
(By N.K. Han and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>P.K. Chiang, vice president of the
Legislative Yuan and a former chairman of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) , unveiled Monday a five-point
strategy to improve Taiwan's economy, focusing on lifting Taiwan's
role in innovation and as a business operations hub.</P>
      <P>Chiang made the comments while giving a speech at a seminar held
at Oxford University about Taiwan's economic situation and the new
environment in Asia.</P>
      <P>To effectively lift Taiwan's economy, Chiang said, it is
important that Taiwan finds a niche in the value-added production
chain, strengthens its R&amp;D and innovation, builds itself into a
global business operations center, steps up labor division in
cooperation with mainland China and takes part in regional trade
organizations.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the mainland is quickly emerging as an economic
power, Chiang said Taiwan has come under mounting pressure to avoid
becoming an outcast in Asia at a time when the formation of bilateral
and multilateral agreements is set to boom in the region as a result
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum's inability to promote
investment and trade liberalization.</P>
      <P>As the mainland is increasingly becoming a factory for the world,
as well as a huge market, Chiang said that these factors will have a
great impact on the development of East Asian economies.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by the United Nations, the mainland
has continuously been the leading country among the developing
nations in terms of attracting foreign investment over the past 10
years. In 2002, as much as US$52.7 billion in foreign capital was
channeled into the country, replacing the U.S. as the world's top
receiver of foreign capital.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Taiwan capital was also entering the mainland
at a fast pace, he noted. From 1952 through 2001, mainland-bound
investment accounted for 38.82 percent of Taiwan's total
foreign-bound capital, he said, adding that the ratio had increased
to 66.61 percent by 2002.</P>
      <P>According to tallies released by mainland authorities, Taiwan
businesses have so far realized a total of 55,691 investment plans on
the mainland worth more than US$33.1 billion, he went on. However, it
is widely assumed that the actual figure could have exceeded US$50
billion.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's mainland-bound investment mainly goes to the electronics
and the home appliance sectors, making the mainland a major
manufacturing base for the two important domestic industries, the
ex-CEPD chief said.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the mainland has also become Taiwan's largest
export market, absorbing 25 percent of the island's total outbound
shipments.</P>
      <P>Since the levels of Taiwan's imports from the mainland are
relatively low, the island has been enjoying a comfortable trade
surplus with the other side of the Taiwan Strait over the past few
decades, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>The mainland's rise has pushed Taiwan toward capital- and
technology-intensive sectors, he explained, detailing that the
percentage of Taiwan's exports of technological products grew from
26.7 percent of its total in the 1990s to the current 46.6 percent.</P>
      <P>Attributing Taiwan's economic slowdown in recent years to the
global situation and political instability at home, the veteran
economist suggested that the government take broad measures in a wide
range of fields to pursue progress, including setting up direct
cross-strait links, further opening the domestic market to mainland
investors and tourists, and joining regional free trade pacts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THIRD TIME A CHARM FOR ROC TORPEDO TEST AS TARGET SUNK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Republic of China Navy submarine
successfully fired a torpedo at a target ship Tuesday in a drill held
off Pingtung, southern Taiwan, the navy reported.</P>
      <P>After the decommissioned target destroyer was sunk, ROC Navy
Commander-in- chief Miao Yung-ching said the navy's confidence had
been restored. He was referring to a similar test firing last month
that failed to hit the target ship and the fact that the first try
earlier Tuesday was also a failure.</P>
      <P>Miao also said he would look into the cause of the two previous
failures.</P>
      <P>Lin Cheng-yi, head of the ROC Navy Fleet Command as well as the
commander of the drill, confirmed that a torpedo fired at 1,571
meters below the sea from a Dutch-built Sea Dragon submarine Tuesday
morning failed to hit its target.</P>
      <P>The torpedo is designed to lose electrical power 53 minutes after
firing and would therefore not pose any threat to fishermen or ships
operating nearby, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The navy arranged for the Sea Dragon submarine to test fire
another torpedo at 2 p.m., but three fishing boats transgressed into
the area and the drill was postponed for nearly 30 minutes.</P>
      <P>The submarine was able to launch the torpedo at 2:25 p.m. and hit
its target -- a decommissioned Yang-class destroyer -- eight minutes
after the firing. The destroyer sank and will be used to attract fish
as an artificial shelf.</P>
      <P>Tuesday morning, the ROC Air Force and Navy conducted two
other successful firings.</P>
      <P>Three Mirage-2000 fighters took off from the Hsinchu Air Base at
8: 10 a.m. Tuesday and one of the aircraft fired an MICA missile at a
propeller-driven target drone designed by the military-run Chungshan
Institute of Science and Technology (CIST), making a direct hit. The
test was conducted not far from the outlying islands of Penghu.</P>
      <P>After the successful downing of the target drone, the marines
also test-fired an anti-air shrapnel missile, which successfully hit
its target drone, also designed by the CIST.</P>
      <P>Last month the ROC Navy test-fired a German-made SUT-type torpedo
launched from a locally built Chengkung-class missile frigate during
a training exercise in waters off Ilan, northeastern Taiwan, but the
torpedo missed its target. It was eventually recovered on Ilan beach.
Tuesday's drill was meant partially to overcome the previous month's
failure.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP LAWMAKERS ADVISE CAUTION ON SELECTION OF PRESIDENTIAL RUNNING MATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than a dozen legislators of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) representing various factions
offered a joint statement Tuesday with their suggestions on the
issue of who President Chen Shui-bian's running mate should be in the
presidential election next year.</P>
      <P>The president has kept the public in suspense for months about his
running mate, saying only that the matter could wait until a party
congress in December, although the president seemed to have tipped
his hand when he recently appealed for the public to support him and
Vice President Annette Lu again in the election. The president's
words were interpreted as his wish to maintain the status quo.</P>
      <P>The DPP legislators stressed in the statement that the
presidential election next year is crucial in terms of "the future of
the DPP and Taiwan, " and they expressed the hope that the president,
who concurrently serves as the DPP chairman, will "solicit views from
all walks of life" and act "cautiously."</P>
      <P>They said that they believe that President Chen's vice
presidential candidate should meet the following three conditions:
to meet the expectations of the general public, to contribute to the
popularity of the president, and to coordinate well with the
president.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lai Chin-lin said that the 2004 presidential election
will not only determine whether the DPP will continue to be in power,
but will be crucial to whether Taiwan can deepen its democracy,
continue its reforms and give a clear direction of the nation's
future.</P>
      <P>The choice of Lu would be a major factor affecting the result of
the election, and the statement co-signed by the DPP factions
advised the president to "cautiously consider his decision, " Lai
said.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hsiao Bi-khim said that legislators did not expressly
advocate a specific candidate in the statement, but since there is
currently a "cacophony" concerning the choice, the legislators felt
that it was time to forge a consensus within the party.</P>
      <P>Responding to the three conditions, Vice President Lu said that
they are "good and correct," and that if the legislators approach her
to sign the statement she is "willing to do so."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, several other DPP legislators said Tuesday that the
law should be revised to stipulate that either the president or the
vice president should be a woman.</P>
      <P>Legislator Wei Ming-ku said that this idea is in reaction to
the calls by the opposition "pan-blue alliance," - the Kuomintang and
People First Party - for more woman members in the cabinet.</P>
      <P>Wei said that the concept is to increase the profile of the
participation of women in politics, but that this does not mean that
the legislators endorse current vice president Lu; other woman
candidates could be just as suitable.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen Chi-mai, party whip of the DPP caucus, said that
before the party congress in December, which will formally nominate
the party's candidates for the president and vice president, the DPP
will "fully respect" the legislators' advice and their ideal
candidates.</P>

      <P>Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore stressed
the importance of vigilance and precautionary actions to the
enhancement of national security Tuesday at the 37th International
Carnahan Conference on Security and Technology in Taipei.</P>
      <P>He said making good use of existing information is more important
than collecting more information about potential dangers to national
security. Many tragedies can be avoided, if precautionary steps are
taken as soon as signs of danger are discovered.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, the terrorist attacks in New York on Sept.
11, 2001 could have been avoided if precautionary actions were taken
soon after law enforcement officers discovered that two Middle
Eastern men on the FBI's terrorist list bought tickets in August,
2001 to travel on the same flight.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSU TO PROPOSE LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER WITHDRAW FROM PARTY ACTIVITIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct 14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
said Tuesday that it will propose a change to the Legislative Yuan's
rules to prevent the speaker or vice speaker from concurrently
serving in a party post or from engaging in party activities.</P>
      <P>Liao Pen-yen, TSU caucus whip in the legislature, said that in
previous administrations, this situation often gave rise to
misgivings among the other political parties that the speakers were
more concerned about their own party's interests when presiding over
legislative sessions.</P>
      <P>Liao said the TSU has taken its cue from the examples of Japan,
South Korea and France in deciding to make the proposal.</P>
      <P>TSU Legislator Lo chih-ming said the proposal "has nothing to do"
with the Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng's impending service
as the presidential election campaign manager for Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Lien Chan and his running mate James Soong, chairman of the
People First Party.</P>
      <P>Noting that the TSU cannot keep Wang from stumping for others
outside the Legislative Yuan, Lo said that the TSU caucus respects
Wang and hopes that he will help establish the model of neutrality in
matters of the legislature.</P>
      <P>Noting that Wang said in a recent speech that as a legislative
speaker he has had to harmonize the central committee and legislative
caucus of his party as well as the caucuses of the other political
parties, and that sometimes "it is difficult to avoid being partial,"
Lo said Wang "should exercise propriety and be a role model during
his term."</P>
      <P>TSU Legislator Chen Chien-ming said that the Examination Yuan,
Judicial Yuan and Control Yuan all have regulations requiring that
their speakers and vice speakers withdraw from political party
activities, asking why the Legislative Yuan is an exception.</P>
      <P>TSU legislators said privately that Vice Legislative Yuan Speaker
P.K. Chiang accompanying KMT Chairman Lien on his current visit to
Great Britain goes against established practice under the
constitution.</P>
      <P>They also said that this has left Legislative Yuan President Wang
with more work than he can handle.</P>
      <P>Both Wang and Chiang concurrently serve as vice chairmen of the
KMT.</P>
      <P>The TSU legislators noted that the situation in the legislature
could become even more chaotic as the presidential election
approaches if the regulations aren't put in place regarding the
speaker and vice speaker.</P>

    <TEXT>The Manila Bulletin: Al-Ghozi killed in N.
Cotabato.

GENERAL SANTOS CITY -- Indonesian terrorist and bomb expert Fathur
Rohman al-Ghozi is definitely dead.

The Philippine Daily Inquirer: Killing of al-Ghozi: Shootout or
rubout?

A military officer said the police elite team paid a big amount
of money to guards and coddlers of terrorist Fathur Rohman al-Ghozi
and then executed him.

The Philippine Star: 'What shootout?'

Local officials and residents in the North Cotabato town where
the confessed Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) bombmaker was killed said there
was no sign of a gunfight, fueling speculation that Al-Ghozi had long
been recaptured and then killed at the best time to boost the Arroyo
administration's anti-terror image.

The Manila Times: 'PCSO funding GMA bid'

AS promised, Sen. Pan-filo M. Lacson on Mon-day delivered the
third and last part of the Jose Pidal expose, this time directly
accusing Presi-dent Arroyo of using go-vernment funds in her 2004

    <TEXT>Today is Tuesday, Oct. 14, or the 19th day

government orders a halt to the practice of binding the feet of

accomplishment of great things consists in doing little things well.
He knows that great effects are produced by small causes. He knows
the evidence and reality of what cannot be perceived by the senses.
Thus he is enabled to enter into the world of ideas and morals."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>HP TO MAKE TAIWAN GLOBAL LOGISTICS CENTER FOR INFORMATION PRODUCTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  15 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hewlett-Packard Co. (HP) of the United
States announced on Wednesday that it will go forward with a plan to
develop Taiwan into a global logistics center for information
products.</P>
      <P>HP made the announcement at a news conference accompanied by
representatives of the major airlines in Taiwan, which will become
HP's trading partners in the plan.</P>
      <P>Duane Zitzner, HP's vice president and general manager of the
company's Personal Information Products Group, flew to Taiwan to
preside over the news conference.</P>
      <P>Zitzner noted that HP is the largest foreign investor in
information products in Taiwan and the first one to react to the
policy of the Republic of China government to make Taiwan a global
operations hub.</P>
      <P>He said that at a time when the high-technology industry has its
supply chain professionally distributed, HP should have a more
efficient administration of its global resources.</P>
      <P>Zitzner added that when many companies shifted their assembly and
manufacturing operations to mainland China, HP was confident of
Taiwan's capability of being a logistics hub. HP will first help
Taiwan become its R&amp;D and supply center, and then develop it into a
global logistics hub, Zitzner said.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, HP can also efficiently reduce the time and cost
for merchandise distribution, thus increasing considerably its
competitiveness, Zitzner said.</P>
      <P>HP officials said that in the first stage the company will
cooperate with Taiwan's major airlines, including China Airlines, EVA
Airways, and Far East Air Transport Corp., to transport HP products
manufactured in eastern mainland China to Taiwan via Hong Kong or
Macau to export them to the global market, which the officials
estimated can reduce the transport time from 12 hours to less than 10
hours.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, ROC Vice Premier Lin Hsin-i said that many Taiwanese
high-tech companies have shifted approximately 70 percent of their
production to the eastern part of mainland China. However, the
transport capacity there is insufficient; therefore, using Taiwan's
logistics capabilities will be the best way to deliver products to
the global market, Lin added.</P>
      <P>HP officials stressed that under the plan, Taiwan's electronic
industry can more efficiently integrate production both on the island
and in mainland China, and have a more flexible market deployment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER ATTACHES IMPORTANCE TO INVESTMENT PROMOTION CONFERENCE</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun instructed all relevant
government agencies Wednesday to do everything in their power to make
the upcoming 2003 Taiwan Business Alliance Conference a success.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a weekly Cabinet meeting, Yu said that the
investment-promotion conference, slated for Oct. 19-22 in Taipei,
will be the largest of its kind ever held in Taiwan and has attracted
attention from the international business sector.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has high hopes for the conference, Yu
noted, adding that its success will be helpful for improving Taiwan's
image internationally.</P>
      <P>The theme of the conference: "Invest in Taiwan, Access the
World, " represents both the government's and the business sector's
intention to bring Taiwan's economy to another climax by courting
more investments from excellent domestic and foreign enterprises, Yu
stressed.</P>
      <P>According to organizers of the conference, more than 1,780
businessmen from 30 countries have registered to participate in the
four-day event which is sponsored by the Executive Yuan and jointly
organized by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, China External Trade
Development Council and the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Foreign participants of the meeting will receive a top quality
treatment beginning from their arrival at the airport where specially
assigned receptionists will lead them to clear customs and then
special service buses or sedans will take them to hotels in Taipei,
the organizers said. The special services will be available from Oct.
17, they added.</P>
      <P>The organizers will also set up service desks at hotels where
foreign guests will stay during the meeting period, providing them
with any assistance they need.</P>
      <P>Many renowned multinational enterprises are expected to announce
their respective investment projects in Taiwan or to sign cooperation
accords with their Taiwan counterparts during the meeting, including
Acatel of France, Fujitsu of Japan, and Crane Aerospace of the United
States.</P>
      <P>Participants have confirmed thus far a total of 113 investment
projects worth a combined NT$68.21 billion (US$2 billion) and have

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, AUSTRALIA SIGN PROTOCOL ON SECURITIES COOPERATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  15 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Securities and Futures Commission (SFC)
Chairman Ting Ker-hua clinched a protocol agreement Wednesday in
Seoul with Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC)
Chairman David Knott to substantiate two-way cooperation and
information exchanges, according to SFC officials.</P>
      <P>The accord not only will bolster bilateral cooperation in
securities and futures markets, but also is hard evidence that the
SFC's long-term efforts in setting market regulations and operational
mechanisms have aroused a keen interest from the international
securities market, the officials said.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the cooperation protocol was the
first of its kind ever signed by the SFC with a foreign counterpart.
The SFC had already inked a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to step
up two-way interaction with its other 19 counterparts, they noted.</P>
      <P>A protocol provides a higher degree of legal status for mutual
cooperation and requires concrete measures to boost a wider scope of
information exchanges on a larger range of financial derivatives than
an MOU, the officials explained.</P>
      <P>They further pointed out that the Taiwan-Australia agreement also
represents a breakthrough in Taiwan's efforts to move toward its aim
of having more throw weight in the global market, which is also in
concert with the government's market liberalization policy.</P>
      <P>Ting and Knott were in the South Korean capital to take part in
the 2003 annual conference of the International Organization of
Securities Commissions. The two men used the occasion to ink the pact
on the sideline of the Oct. 14-17 meeting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN PITCHES FOR NEW CONSTITUTION AS CURE TO PROBLEMS PLAGUING TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 15 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Rewriting the ROC Constitution is the cure
for many problems dogging the country, President Chen Shui-bian said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking to a group of the country's industrial leaders, the
president said a new constitution is necessary and should be put to a
referendum vote to side-step the red tape surrounding the process of
amending the current Constitution.</P>
      <P>Chen, who created political ripples on Sept. 28 by calling for
the formulation of a new constitution for the country by 2006,
disputed critics' claims that he has an axe to grind, saying that he
wouldn't benefit from the idea because any new constitution enacted
in 2006 would not take force until 2008, when his second term, if he
wins re-election in 2004, has run out.</P>
      <P>Whether or not the country should stay out of mainland China's
fold forever is not the only problem to be solved through a new
constitution; many other problems, such as people's basic rights,
environmental protection, election of public officials, the structure
of the government, and the concerns of industry all need to be
addressed in a new constitution, Chen went on.</P>
      <P>Citing as an example, Chen said it is unfair that the Executive
Yuan has only one deputy premier while every county of the nation has
two deputy magistrates according to the existing Constitution.
Furthermore, the president said, whether or not the administrative
level of Taiwan Province should be abolished should be dealt with in
a new constitution.</P>
      <P>Repairing the flawed existing Constitution is a difficult
political task in view of the troublesome procedures. In order to cut
corners to get the new constitution ready by 2006, the president
called for a plebiscite on the new constitution rather than having to
follow the procedures provided for in the current Constitution.</P>
      <P>"Giving the 23 million people a final say in writing the
constitution is the materialization of a full democracy, " the
president said.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the weather getting cooler,
scores of endangered black-faced spoonbills have begun flocking to
the Chiku Wetlands in the southern Taiwan county of Tainan to
overwinter, wild bird conservationists said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Among the birds was one wearing a tag that indicated it had been
released from temporary captivity in Taiwan last March after
receiving treatment for botulism poisoning.</P>
      <P>"The bird had a blue-red colored 'T20' ring on it leg. It was one
of the 17 black-faced spoonbills that were released into the wild
after they recovered from botulism poisoning, " said a member of a
local private black-faced spoonbill research association.</P>
      <P>Also arriving at the wetlands Wednesday was a bird that carries
an "A08" ring, indicating that it was once caught and tagged by Hong
Kong wild bird conservationists for research purposes.</P>
      <P>"The move is aimed at facilitating research on their migration
paths and reproduction habitats," the association member said.</P>
      <P>Wild bird conservation groups in North and South Korea, Taiwan
and Hong Kong have been conducting such research. Taiwan alone has
tagged 26 black-faced spoonbills, while other countries have placed
rings on 33 other birds.</P>
      <P>Each year, a large proportion of the world's remaining
black-faced spoonbills migrate from the Korean Peninsula and
northeastern mainland China to the Chiku wetlands to overwinter. More
than 700 arrived last year, during which 71 of the birds died. It was
the first time a massive die-off had occurred.</P>

(TOISTA) , comprised of over 80 information industry-related
companies, including leading firms such as CMC Magnetics and RITEK.</P>
      <P>Lu said Taiwan will regain its economic footing internationally,
citing figures that she said indicate that Taiwan's economic recovery
is already underway. Taiwan posted an economic growth rate of 3.6
percent for 2002, ahead of the United States' 2.4 percent,
Singapore's 2.2 percent and the world's average of 2 percent.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also sits on the world's third-largest foreign exchange
reserves and enjoys a strong competitiveness in terms of
technological development potential, its macro-economy, investment
climate and export growth, she added.</P>
      <P>The vice president said she had high hopes for the association,
encouraging it to pool the wisdom of the government, academic and
research sectors to help transform Taiwan into an innovation-oriented
country capable of creating its own brands, instead of just being a
contractor. She stressed that the logo "made in Taiwan" should be
upgraded to "invented in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The output value of Taiwan's optical information storage industry
hit NT$210 billion (US$6.17 billion) in 2002, the world's
third-highest level, and is expected to top NT$1 trillion in 2008,
business sources said.</P>
      <P>Huang Teh-ruey, TOISTA president and vice director of the
Opto-Electronics &amp; Systems Laboratories under the Industrial
Technology Research Institute, said the domestic sector has done much
to promote related businesses in recent years, including setting up a
Secure Digital Memory (SDM) Club composed of more than 100 companies
from related fields such as DVD and SDM.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, Taiwan-based companies also have gotten
together to form an institutionalized alliance dedicated to helping
settle disputes about intellectual property rights with foreign
companies and to research and develop programs. Initial results
obtained by the alliance has already gained a high degree of
international attention, he noted.</P>
      <P>RITEK's chief executive officer, Yeh Chue-ching, said Taiwan-made
CD-ROMs enjoy the lion's share of 70 percent in the global market,
giving Taiwan an advantage in having a say as to setting industry
standards and rules for compact discs for the coming generation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER PRESIDENT TO LEAD 1-MILLION RALLY NEXT FEBRUARY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui will mobilize
1 million people Feb. 28, 2004, to stump for President Chen
Shui-bian's re-election bid in March, the head of a pro-Lee
organization said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Friends of Lee Teng-hui President Huang Kun-fu, presidential
adviser and chairman of the World United Formosans for Independence
Chairman Huang Chao-tang, Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
Secretary-General Lin Jih-jia, ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) Vice Secretary-General Lee Ying-yuan and the Alliance to
Campaign for Rectifying the name of Taiwan Executive Director Wang
Hsih-chi called on the former president at the Taiwan Research
Institute, where Lee serves as honorary chairman.</P>
      <P>During the more-than one-hour meeting, they discussed issues
related to drumming up support for Chen's re-election bid and decided
that the rally will be held simultaneously in 22 cities and counties
around the country, with either Taipei or Kaohsiung serving as the
main venue.</P>
      <P>The decision to seek a meeting with Lee was made after 25 pro-DPP
groups, including Friends of Lee Teng-hui, World United Formosans for
Independence, Taiwan Society North, the Foundation of Medical
Professionals Alliance in Taiwan and the Taiwan Association of
University Professors met the previous evening to work out the plan
to stage the rally, and invited the DPP to join.</P>
      <P>The participants said that as Feb. 28 is less than a month before
the presidential election set for March 20 and is significant in
Taiwan's quest for democracy, the former president decided it would
be the most suitable day and that the rally will call for the
solidarity of the people, the defense of the "native regime" and
support for Chen's re-election bid.</P>
      <P>The former president noted that although Hong Kong has only 6
million people, half a million of them took to the streets July 1 to
protest against an anti-subversion law. "It certainly will not be a
problem to mobilize 1 million people in Taiwan, " the participants
quoted Lee as saying.</P>
      <P>Lee also said that "if President Chen succeeds in his bid, then
the following work, including the introduction of a new constitution
and the rectifying the name of the nation will be carried out, "
according to the participants.</P>
      <P>TSU official Hsiao Kuan-yi said that although the rallies will be
staged across the island, they will be connected through
teleconferences, and the speeches of Lee and Chen at the major venue
will bring the activities to a climax. The final details will be
finalized Oct. 31 when the former president meets again with
representatives of the pro-DPP groups, they said.</P>
      <P>DPP Vice Secretary-General Lee Ying-yuan also presented Lee with
a matching cap and vest of support for an Oct. 25 rally in Kaohsiung
orchestrated by the DPP to drum up support for referendum
legislation, but the participants of the meeting quoted Lee as saying
that he wants to focus on the Feb. 28 rally and would not attend.</P>
      <P>TSU Secretary-General Lin Jih-Jia said that the party will
mobilize 50,000 people to participate the referendum rally.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT PITCHES FOR VOLUNTEER SERVICE, DIPLOMACY BY PEOPLE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday
that he looks forward to seeing more Taiwan people volunteer their
services to help boost the nation's development and its diplomatic
relations.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with two volunteer groups who
will soon leave Taiwan to work abroad helping cement Taiwan's
relations with its diplomatic allies or cultivating partnerships with
countries that do not have official ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>One group is composed of 41 young men who have been assigned to
work in selected countries as alternative to mandatory military
service, and the other group comprises 44 civilian volunteers who
will be sent abroad to work for various cooperative projects
organized by the Taiwan-financed International Cooperation and
Development Fund (ICDF).</P>
      <P>Chen noted that this year marks the third time that the Republic
of China has sent conscripts abroad to carry out alternative
diplomatic service and the seventh time that the ICDF has sent
volunteers abroad to assist in Chinese language teaching, vocational
training and medical and technical services.</P>
      <P>"Through these projects, we can demonstrate to the world our
willingness to volunteer our services in helping boost the well-being
of needy countries," Chen said, adding that he admires the dedication
of both groups to the nation's diplomatic cause.</P>
      <P>He further said he believes that if all local people were willing
to contribute some of their leisure time to volunteer services,
either at home or abroad, Taiwan would be able to sustain its
national development and project a "global volunteer" image in the
international community.</P>
      <P>In his view, Chen said, volunteer service, international
cooperation, sustainable development and diplomacy by the people
should not be just political slogans.</P>
      <P>"They offer new visions and should be new core values in our
pursuit of a new international image for Taiwan," Chen added.</P>
      <P>Six of the 44 ICDF-trained volunteers are aged over 50 and this
is the first time the ICDF has selected retired professionals to join
its overseas volunteer corps.</P>
      <P>"Despite their age, the six 'elderly' volunteers have expertise
and as much passion to work for our diplomatic cause as other younger
members," said an ICDF official.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA TO ASSIST TAITUNG EXPORTS OF CUSTARD APPLES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) is to help
the southeastern county of Taitung to export one of its most famous
products, the custard apple, a legislator said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Huang Jian-ting of the opposition Kuomintang said that
the first batch of custard apples will be exported to Singapore Oct.
20, with further shipments to be exported to Hong Kong and Shanghai
next year at the earliest.</P>
      <P>Huang noted that custard apples produced by Australia are
exported all over the world with great success, even though they are
much smaller and dark brown in color. In comparison, Taitung's
specialty -- the hybrid "pineapple" custard apple -- is huge, bright
green and sweet.</P>
      <P>He lamented that poor marketing and the perishable nature of the
succulent fruit has prevented growers from exporting for many years,
while intensive production of has caused the price to plunge.</P>
      <P>Huang noted that custard apples currently only sell for between
NT$30 and NT$40 (US$0.88-US$1.18) per kilogram this year, which is a
far cry from just two years ago, when the fruit could command prices
of NT$200 or NT$300 per kilogram.</P>
      <P>To expand the distribution network for the fruit, Huang said, he
has solicited help from the COA to overcome the technical problems of
refrigeration so as to facilitate exports.</P>
      <P>Huang said that following great efforts, he was happy to learn
that the COA is willing to help Taitung growers export their fruit,
which he said will help solve the overproduction problem and the
slumping price.</P>
      <P>Huang noted that COA Chairman Lee Chin-lung has been seeking to
establish an export network for Taiwan fruit ever since he assumed
office. He has several times invited domestic suppliers to meet and
discuss the export of various types of fruit, including custard
apples, and has also invited foreign importers to come to Taiwan to
learn about and observe fruit cultivation here.</P>
      <P>Huang noted that Taitung custard apple growers have enjoyed small
success with exports, although the volume has been small, with only
2,030 kg exported last year, worth US$4,300, and purely as a result
of the efforts of the growers without COA help.</P>
      <P>"It is good to know that the government is willing to help
promote Taitung's pineapple custard apples, " Huang said, adding that
it will not only solve the marketing problem, but will also help
increase the earnings of Taitung growers.</P>

said Wednesday.</P>

Taiwan-U.S. relations, the general international situation and other

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Wednesday
expressed approval for the Taiwan District of Kiwanis International's
recent name change from the "Republic of China District of Kiwanis
International."</P>
      <P>The ROC District of Kiwanis International authorities applied
with Taiwan's Ministry of the Interior and the U.S.-based Kiwanis
International in early September for the name change to better
reflect the reality and cope with international situations.</P>
      <P>President Chen met with visiting international executive director
of Kiwanis International, Eddie Sigurosson, at the Presidential
Office where he offered his appreciation to the organization for its
support to the Taiwan-affiliated chapter regarding the name change.</P>
      <P>Chen said the name change is of great significance for both the
Taiwan District of Kiwanis International as well as all the people of
Taiwan in terms of identity.</P>
      <P>The president also expressed his admiration for Kiwanis
International -- which he described as a thriving organization of
service- and community-minded individuals who support children and
young adults around the world -- for choosing to hold its annual
general meeting in Taiwan in 2001.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Taiwan District of Kiwanis International, Chen
made a donation of US$100,000 to Kiwanis International to help out
with the organization's humanitarian aid efforts around the world.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the Taiwan District of Kiwanis International
has donated more than US$3.5 million to Kiwanis International for
humanitarian assistance worldwide.</P>
      <P>For his part, Sigurosson said that it was his pleasure to assist
Taiwan in hosting the 2001 Kiwanis International general meeting,
adding that he admires Taiwan's economic prowess and its people's
compassion shown to other peoples around the world.</P>
      <P>Sigurosson offered his appreciation for Taiwan's fresh donation,
which he said will be used to serve the children of the world.</P>
      <P>Kiwanis was founded in Detroit, Michigan, in 1915. The name
Kiwanis comes from an old American Indian term meaning "we make
ourselves known." The club's motto is "We Build."</P>
      <P>Kiwanis is an organization of local clubs of business and
professional men and women who are interested in community service.
More than 600,000 Kiwanis family members in 89 countries regularly
support community projects and are active in public affairs as well
as work to promote international understanding and good will. They
also provide career guidance to young people and sponsor youth
activities.</P>

Thursday.</P>
      <P>Klaus-Peter Schwabe, president of the oldest and most venerated

    <HEADLINE>AIT CHAIRWOMAN CONCERNED ABOUT NEW CONSTITUTION DRIVE: MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's drive to write a new constitution
and mainland China's intensified military buildup are major concerns
of the visiting top U.S. liaison officer with Taiwan, Minister of
Foreign Affairs Eugene Chien said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chien made the remarks after hosting a luncheon in honor of
American Institute in Taiwan Chairwoman Therese Shaheen, who arrived
in Taipei Oct. 13 for a week-long fact-finding trip.</P>
      <P>During the lunch meeting, Chien said, Shaheen expressed concern
about President Chen Shui-bian's latest proposal to introduce a new
constitution for Taiwan in 2006.</P>
      <P>"I told Shaheen that Chen's call for a new constitution is mainly
aimed at facilitating Taiwan's democratic reforms and creating a
constitutional framework that fits Taiwan's present reality, " Chien
said.</P>
      <P>After listening to Chien's briefing, Shaheen was quoted as having
said she could understand Taiwan's need. She suggested that the ROC
government let its people know more about the new constitution's
content and the timetable for its formulation, Chien said.</P>
      <P>"Shaheen also told me that the U.S. government hopes to get more
information about developments in Taiwan's new constitution drive, "
the minister added.</P>
      <P>Chien said Shaheen is also concerned about Taiwan's enforcement
of intellectual property rights (IPR) laws. "Shaheen said there is
still ample room for Taiwan to improve its IPR law enforcement to
better protect U.S. firms' legitimate rights and interests, " Chien
said.</P>
      <P>According to Chien, cross-Taiwan Strait relations are also high
on Shaheen's agenda. "With mainland China continually expanding its
military arsenal, Shaheen wants to know our combat preparedness and
hopes that we can beef up our military muscle to defend our own
security," he added.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Shaheen met with Defense Minister Tang
Yiau-min, who reportedly expressed Taiwan's hope that the United
States can deliver on its promise to sell Taiwan eight conventional
submarines.</P>
      <P>During their talks, Tang reportedly also urged the United States
to allow Taiwan's state-owned China Shipbuilding Corp. to participate
in the construction of some of the submarines to be sold to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Later that evening, Shaheen paid a courtesy call on Vice
President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>Lu gave Shaheen a warm welcome. "I hope you can get first-hand
information about Taiwan's latest developments and its progress in
various aspects," Lu was quoted as having told her guest.</P>
      <P>This is Shaheen's first trip to Taiwan since she assumed the AIT
post late last year. In addition to meeting with ROC officials, she
will also inspect AIT operations in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO SIGN FREE TRADE PACT WITH 2ND ALLY SOON: MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Bangkok,  Oct.  16 (CNA)
(By Wu Hui-chun and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China will sign a free
trade agreement (FTA) with a second diplomatic ally soon, Minister of
Economic Affairs Lin Yi-fu said in Bangkok Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lin arrived in Bangkok a day earlier to attend the annual
ministerial meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum, which will formally open Friday.</P>
      <P>"Once Taiwan had signed a free trade pact with Panama, several
other ROC diplomatic allies in Latin America began showing keen
interest in striking a similar deal with us, " Lin said, adding that
Taiwan is negotiating detailed terms with those countries.</P>
      <P>If all goes well, Lin said, Taiwan will sign a free trade
agreement with one of those countries soon. He did not divulge the
name of the country.</P>
      <P>In addition to negotiating free trade pacts with its diplomatic
allies, Lin said, Taiwan also looks forward to signing similar
accords with countries that do not recognize the ROC diplomatically.</P>
      <P>On the sidelines of the annual APEC ministerial meeting, Lin said
he will hold bilateral talks with his counterparts from at least 10
other APEC member economies.</P>
      <P>"I'll take advantage of those occasions to lobby them to sign
free trade pacts with Taiwan to boost economic cooperation for mutual
benefit," Lin said.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, Lin went on, various major world trading
powers are interested in signing free trade agreements with Taiwan.
"But they have shown some reservations because of pressure from
mainland China," Lin said, adding that despite Beijing's obstruction,
Taiwan will still make every possible effort to sign free trade pacts
with its major trading partners, most of which do not recognize
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As for Taiwan's designation in free trade pacts to be signed with
major trading partners, Lin said the most favored is the nation's
official title "Republic of China."</P>
      <P>"Taiwan would be the second choice, followed by the designation
of 'Taiwan economy,'" Lin said, adding that the last choice would be
the "Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu"
-- a designation used to describe Taiwan in the World Trade
Organization.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW TAIWAN DOLLAR RELATIVELY STABLE: CBC GOVERNOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 16 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Central Bank of China (CBC) Governor Perng
Fai-nan said Thursday that the new Taiwan dollar remains relatively
stable, despite rampant speculation that the currency will shortly
appreciate noticeably.</P>
      <P>Perng made the remarks while fielding questions at a legislative
committee from lawmakers who are deeply concerned about the course of
the new Taiwan dollar at a time when Asian currencies, including the
yen of Japan and the renminbi, are under strong pressure from the
United States to appreciate.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the domestic currency has remained stable against
an appreciating U.S. dollar compared to the yen and the won of South
Korea, Perng said its value is decided basically according to the
market momentum. "The central bank will interfere only when necessary
or because of seasonal reasons," he explained.</P>
      <P>The new Taiwan dollar dropped by 1 percent in value, lower than
the yen's 1.2 percent and the won's 1.6 percent when it was reported
that the third-quarter U.S. economic growth rate had reached 6.5
percent, while the fourth-quarter ratio was estimated at 4 percent.</P>
      <P>The currency stood at 33.95 against the greenback Thursday,
finishing NT$0.05 higher than Wednesday's level.</P>
      <P>Perng said the CBC will ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to
transfer to Washington the position papers it has prepared about
Taiwan's stance, now that Taiwan's trade surplus with the United
States has narrowed.</P>
      <P>Turning to the question of whether the local currency has been
underestimated and whether that could lead to an influx of
international "hot money, " the CBC governor pointed out that the
central bank will not allow players to speculate on the new Taiwan
dollar, even though the domestic foreign exchange market has already
become more open and liberal.</P>
      <P>Citing CBC statistics, Perng said about US$60 billion in foreign
capital was channeled into Taiwan during the first nine months of
this year. As a "flat-dish" economy, Taiwan's economy will be easily
affected by market dealers in the absence of appropriate management.</P>
      <P>Regarding the CBC's attitude toward allowing mainland Chinese
capital to enter Taiwan, Perng said the matter must be weighed
carefully due to the delicate relations between the two sides. He
added that the CBC is cautiously open to setting up a swap mechanism
between the new Taiwan dollar and the renminbi and has called
meetings with the relevant agencies to study the issue.</P>
      <P>A recent revision to the Statute Governing the Relations Between
the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area will allow Taiwan
travelers to carry a certain amount of renminbi to and from the
mainland, raising concerns as to whether an accountability system
should be established between the two currencies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO OFFER BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AT UPCOMING CONFERENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
the government will offer up to NT$400 billion- (US$11.79 billion-)
worth of business opportunities to international manufacturers at an
upcoming conference to create an "irreplaceable edge" for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he addressed a summit forum
on the nation's technology industry strategy, which was co-sponsored
by the Investment Commission under the Ministry of Economic Affairs
and Hewlett Packard (HP).</P>
      <P>Vice Economic Affairs Minister Shih Yen-shiang, HP Executive Vice
President of Personal System Group Duane E. Zitzner, and various
domestic enterprise executives, took part in the forum.</P>
      <P>The president said that the forum was a prelude to the
forthcoming 2003 Taiwan Business Alliance Conference that will run
Oct. 19-22, and he added that all those who participated in the forum
are prime movers who have helped create Taiwan's competitive edge.</P>
      <P>"The information industry has become the backbone of Taiwan's
economy, and it plays a major role in the global computer industry,"
the president said.</P>
      <P>He also said that the island is committed transforming its
industry, eliminating trade obstacles and speeding up its market
liberalization to maintain Taiwan's pivotal role in global technology
industry operations.</P>
      <P>In addition, "the government will also do its best to attract
foreign capital to Taiwan," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said the government will offer NT$400 billion-worth of trade
opportunities during the Taiwan Business Alliance Conference and that
many international manufacturers have committed to investing in
Taiwan. Chen added that through the concerted efforts of the
government, the private sector and "international friends," they will
be able to create Taiwan's "irreplaceable edge" under a division of
labor system.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that the recent government promotion of measures
for faster and more convenient cross-strait air-cargo transportation
should reduce the obstacles to Taiwan's information industry going
global, maintain the edge of the domestic air cargo industry and help
to realize Taiwan's vision of becoming a regional operations hub.</P>
      <P>Zitzner said that Taiwan has played a pivotal role in HP's
division of labor around the world, that HP continues to look highly
on Taiwan's place in the division of labor system in the world, and
is willing to provide timely assistance.</P>
      <P>Shih said that the government will also offer trade opportunities
as part of its six-year national development program to lure foreign
capital to Taiwan and encourage the setting up of research and
development centers or regional headquarters, so as to move toward
building Taiwan into a regional operations hub.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW CONSTITUTION COULD COME INTO EFFECT 2008: PRESIDENTIAL AIDE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Certain procedures would need to be
undertaken after a new constitution was enacted in 2006, thus
explaining President Chen Shui-bian's statement that the constitution
would not come into effect until 2008, Chen's chief of staff said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chiou I-jen, the Secretary-General of the Presidential Office,
also reiterated what Chen has said before -- that the formulation of
a new constitution would not be the work of only one person or party.
It would need the participation of everyone.</P>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party group formed to hash out details
of a new constitution would be aimed not to single-handedly create a
constitution, but to raise the public awareness about the necessity
for writing a new constitution and set up a time frame for enacting
it.</P>
      <P>A national constitution-drafting committee will probably be
formed in the future to write a draft constitution, and put the
result to a referendum.</P>
      <P>The current procedure provided in the ROC Constitution for
revisions includes a debate by the legislature and the approval by
the National Assembly, a time-consuming process that denies the
general public any say and thereby should be sidestepped all
together, Chiou said.</P>
      <P>Although the president hasn't mentioned anything like a
constitution-drafting committee thus far, an organization similar to
it will be set up to bring together different views of various
political parties, Chiou said.</P>
      <P>Chiou is elaborating on a call made by Chen on Sept. 28 for a new
constitution by 2006 and a follow-up statement on Wednesday that he
wouldn't benefit from such a constitution because it would not take
effect until 2008 when he would have served out his second term, that
is, if he wins a second term in the election next year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WANTS U.S. TO FULFILL SUBMARINE SALE PROMISE: DEFENSE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of National Defense Tang Yiau-min
told the top United States liaison official with Taiwan Thursday that
he hoped the U. S. would make good on its promise to sell Taiwan
eight diesel-powered submarines and that Taiwan would be able to
participate in the building of some of them.</P>
      <P>The United States agreed to sell Taiwan the submarines in an
April 2001 arms deal, the largest weapons sale to Taiwan from the
United States in a decade.</P>
      <P>Observers have said that delivering on the promised subs could be
difficult if not impossible given that the United States no longer
builds diesel submarines.</P>
      <P>Tang made the remarks when he visited the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) caucus in the Legislative Yuan to solicit
support for next year's defense budget.</P>
      <P>TSU Legislator Ho Min-hao said the party has long advocated that
the Ministry of Defense should purchase subs under the understanding
that Taiwan should be able to contribute to the construction of the
subs.</P>
      <P>Ho was referring to the concept of the United states allowing
Taiwan's state- owned China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) to help with
the construction of the first of the subs and then turn over the
entire project to the CSBC to finish via transfer of technology.</P>
      <P>Ho said that Tang agreed with the policy of Taiwan building the
subs and said as much to visiting America Institute in Taiwan
Chairwoman Therese Shaheen, who arrived in Taiwan Oct. 13 for a
weeklong fact-finding trip.</P>
      <P>Tang did not comment Shaheen's response but to say that many
obstacles must be overcome for Taiwan to participate in the sub
building project, according to Ho.</P>
      <P>Ho also said that Tang, while explaining the defense budget, said
that the defense ministry has listed C4ISR (command, control,
communications, computer, intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance) systems as its top purchase priority next year, and
will include in the 2005 budget funds for the purchase of six Patriot
missile batteries to upgrade the combat readiness of the nation.</P>
      <P>During the same meeting with the TSU legislators, Tang also
addressed concerns over the failure of the ROC Navy's torpedo test
firing. One of two torpedoes fired at a stationary, de-commissioned
destroyer failed to hit its target Tuesday. Another similar test
failed in early September.</P>
      <P>Tang stressed that the Navy officials in charge of the
exercise are all well trained and that the problem lies with the
hardware, the torpedo, and not the men. He pointed out that torpedoes
were purchased some 10 or 20 years ago, and that he had instructed
his subordinates to review the torpedo inventory and test fire them
irregularly.</P>
      <P>Tang also instructed that the purchase contracts be reviewed to
see if there is a guarantee after sale. If it so, the ministry will
seek redress.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOE TO EXERCISE PRUDENCE IN OPENING DOOR TO MAINLAND UNIVERSITIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16 (CNA)
(BY Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) will
exercise prudence in paving the way for mainland Chinese universities
to recruit prospective students from Taiwan, a senior official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Minister of Education Huang Jung-tsun made the pledge during a
meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Education and Culture Committee
where opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union Legislator Lo Jhih-ming
questioned the appropriateness of allowing mainland Chinese
universities to recruit students from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Is it justifiable to open the education market to mainland
Chinese universities at a time when many of our universities and
vocational schools have A hard time recruiting enough students? " Lo
asked.</P>
      <P>In response, Huang said that although the newly revised statute
governing civilian exchanges across the Taiwan Strait allows for
mainland universities to recruit students from Taiwan, this new
open-door policy cannot be substantiated until several complementary
measures are worked out.</P>
      <P>The cross-strait statute has been amended in line with the
provisions of the World Trade Organization (WTO) which require its
members to mutually open their education markets.</P>
      <P>Huang said although Taiwan and mainland China are now WTO
members, they have yet to forge a bilateral consultative mechanism to
address the education market opening issues.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Huang said, the cross-strait academic accreditation
issue must be resolved before any open-door measures can be adopted.</P>
      <P>Anyway, Huang said, the MOE will make extensive consultations
with relevant government agencies and domestic private and public
universities before drafting detailed enforcement rules for mainland
universities to legally recruit students from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, many Taiwan students have traveled to
mainland China to study at prestigious mainland universities or
graduate institutes in recent years. But Taiwan has so far not
recognized academic degrees granted by those schools.</P>
      <P>"While drafting the market opening regulations, the MOE will take
into consideration the move's possible grave impact on local
universities," Huang assured lawmakers.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 16 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said on Thursday that
the country will enter into the era of digital television in 2006,
when the proportion of digital televisions on the island reaches 85
percent.</P>
      <P>Yu made the announcement at the opening ceremony of the five-day
Taipei International Electronics Show -- TAITRONICS-Finished Products
-- at the Taipei World Trade Center.</P>
      <P>Yu pointed out that the production volume of Taiwan's electrical
and electronics products totaled US$127.1 billion last year,
accounting for 50.98 percent of the total industrial production of
the island.</P>
      <P>With its exports reaching US$65.2 billion in 2002, accounting for
49.9 percent of Taiwan's total exports, the electrical and
electronics sector is posed as the industry with the greatest
potential in Taiwan, Yu said.</P>
      <P>With regard to the main theme of the electronics show -- digital
Technology, Yu noted that the government is actively supporting the
video industry, including LCD and plasma televisions, to bring Taiwan
into an era of digital television (DTV) technology, which will allow
broadcasters to offer television with high-quality picture and sound,
along with a great variety of other enhancements.</P>
      <P>DTV technology can also be used to transmit large amounts of data
into homes, which may be accessible by computer or television sets.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's information and electronics sectors are
quick to react to changes, the premier still urged domestic
electronics entrepreneurs to accelerate the establishment of global
logistics systems, in addition to strengthening research and
development capabilities to maintain their high competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Although the scale of the exhibition is somewhat smaller than
that of last year, there are 61 foreign exhibitors, a considerable
rise of 65 percent over last year. Mainland Chinese manufacturers
also sent their delegations for the first time to participate in the
show.</P>

U.S. legal experts, including Winfried Hassemer, vice president of
Germany's Federal Constitutional Court.</P>
      <P>Just like the European Union, which is discussing the formulation
of a new constitution to cope with the new situation that will arise
following the entry of 10 more states into the union next year,
Taiwan also needs a new constitution that fits the island's present
realities, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen told his guests that his ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) is pushing for the writing of a new constitution for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"According to our preliminary work agenda, we hope that a new
constitution can be ready for a nationwide referendum in 2006, " said
Chen, who concurrently serves as DPP chairman.</P>
      <P>And if all goes well, Chen continued, the new constitution can be
put into force May 20, 2008, to coincide with the inauguration of a
new president of the nation.</P>
      <P>The German and U.S. legal experts, including several specialists
in criminal codes and constitutional law, have gathered in Taipei to
discuss constitutional reform topics with local grand justices and
other law professors.</P>
      <P>Chen said the seminar, co-sponsored by the Judicial Yuan,
National Chengchi University and Germany's famous Alixander von
Humboldt-Stiftung Foundation, is timely and is expected to offer
valuable insights for Taiwan's constitutional reform drive.</P>
      <P>Ulrich Dreesen, director-general of the German Institute in
Taipei, was also present at the meeting.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said a day earlier that revising the flawed
existing constitution is a difficult political task in view of the
troublesome procedures. In order to cut corners to get the new
constitution ready by 2006, the president called for a plebiscite on
the new constitution rather than having to follow the procedures
prescribed in the current Constitution.</P>
      <P>"Giving the 23 million people a final say in writing the
constitution is the materialization of a full democracy, " the
president said, adding that enacting a new constitution will
help resolve a host of problems dogging the country.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Canada-based Bombardier Inc. is
planning to base its regional business operations center in Taiwan to
better explore the Asia-Pacific market, a company executive said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Pierre Lortie, president of Bombardier's transportation
department, said the company, the contractor of engineering
construction for the planned Neihu Line of Taipei's mass rapid
transport system, will search for qualified Taiwan businesses to
cooperate in the manufacture of some relevant facilities through
technology transfer.</P>
      <P>According to Lortie, the Neihu Line's engineering construction
plan worth NT$18.5 billion (US$548 million) is a "big contract" for
the company, which specializes in mass transit system,
passenger rail and other vehicles.</P>
      <P>Around 80 percent of the line's 202 cars will be assembled in
Taiwan, with the remaining to be completed in the United States, he
noted, adding that most of the car facilities, including machinery,
telecommunications equipment and automated toll collecting systems
will be manufactured in Taiwan by a subcontractor.</P>
      <P>Lortie said he was very confident of the planned cooperation
model, as Taiwan is strong in the computer and electronics industry.
If the cooperative venture with Taiwan-based companies goes smoothly,
the Taiwan partners will be commissioned by Bombardier to help in
exploring overseas markets, he added.</P>
      <P>Lortie said the company will start its drive in the Asia-Pacific
region with the Neihu Line by providing the most advanced
technologies to the local partners.</P>
      <P>A seminar sponsored by Bombardier in late September on the Neihu
Line cooperative venture attracted 109 Taiwan companies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HALF OF TAIWAN PEOPLE FAVOR DIRECT ACROSS-STRAIT TRANSPORT: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 17 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>About half of the people in Taiwan are in
favor of opening direct transportation links with mainland China,
according to the results of a government survey made public Friday.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by the Cabinet-level Research, Development,
and Evaluation Commission (RDEC) , found that 46 percent of Taiwan
citizens think that the links would have a positive impact on
Taiwan's economic development, while 55 percent and 45 percent
contend that Taiwan's national security and job market would be
adversely affected, respectively.</P>
      <P>At the same time, around 35 percent of the public said Taiwan's
pace toward a full opening of direct transportation, trade and postal
links is appropriate, while 28 percent said it is too slow and 15
percent said it is too fast.</P>
      <P>As to the government's idea of permitting indirect cargo charter
flight services between Taiwan and Shanghai, 50 percent said they had
no thoughts on the concept, while 54 percent said they support the
government's plan.</P>
      <P>In contrast to the 40 percent who are opposed to the idea of
allowing mainland-based Taiwan businessmen to collect funds through
listing shares in the domestic stock market, 37 percent expressed
support for the proposal.</P>
      <P>Regarding the issue of whether Taiwan should recognize academic
diplomas issued by mainland-based colleges and universities, 60
percent of the respondents agree to the plan but with "stricter
conditions." Only 6 percent totally rejected the idea.</P>
      <P>Around 42 percent of Taiwan citizens said that the eight-year
waiting period imposed on mainland spouses to receive Taiwan ID cards
is acceptable, ahead of 29 percent who said it is too harsh and 15
percent who said it is too lenient.</P>
      <P>Some 45 precent were not satisfied with the government's
performance in its dealings with cross-Taiwan Strait issues,
according to the survey.</P>
      <P>In addition, 34 percent of the people polled supported the
proposal of writing a new constitution in 2006, slightly ahead of 32
percent who disagree with the idea. Nevertheless, 57 percent favor
maintaining the status-quo across the Taiwan Strait, while 23 percent
are pro-Taiwan independence and 7 percent are pro-unification.</P>
      <P>The random telephone survey was carried out by the RDEC Oct. 7-8,

visiting British parliamentarian with a medal Friday at the
Presidential Office in recognition of his contributions to the
promotion of Taiwan-United Kingdom relations.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the ceremony where David Martin Steel, a member of
the British House of Lords, was awarded the Order of Brilliant Star

      <P>President Chen said that the Prize for Freedom that Liberal
International awarded him in 2001 represented not only a great
personal honor, but also recognition of the 23 million people of
Taiwan who accomplished the first peaceful transfer of political
power between parties in Chinese history in 2000.</P>
      <P>The president was not able to receive the award in person.
Republic of China first lady Wu Shu-chen accepted the prize on Chen's
behalf at a ceremony Nov. 14, 2001 in Strasbourg, France.</P>
      <P>Steel has visited Taiwan four times and has witnessed Taiwan's
democratic and economic development, Chen pointed out, adding that
the people of Taiwan appreciate the experiences and achievements
brought by democratization.</P>
      <P>Chen also congratulated Steel for the rapid growth of the Liberal
Democratic Party he founded. The party has become the third-largest
party in the U.K.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that relations between Taiwan and the U.K.
will further strengthen. The U.K. has become the third-largest
trading partner of Taiwan in Europe with two-way trade hitting
US$4.26 billion in 2002.</P>
      <P>In response, Steel said that he has been impressed on each of his
visits by the progress made in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COUNTY CHIEF PLANS TO SEEK FOREIGN AID TO DEMINE KINMEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Oct. 17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng said
Friday he plans to seek foreign financial aid to clear landmines in
coastal regions of the Republic of China-held island of Kinmen, which
lies closer to mainland China than to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee said the landmines littering Kinmen's coastal areas not only
pose great danger to local residents but have also had an adverse
impact on the island's tourism development.</P>
      <P>While the Ministry of National Defense (MND) has come up with a
three-year plan to demine 12 obsolete minefields, Lee said, the plan
is not expected to kick off until 2006.</P>
      <P>According to the plan, the MND will budget a total of NT$468
million between 2006 and 2008 to demine the 12 minefields, which
cover an area of 317,000 square meters.</P>
      <P>"Priority will be given to minefields that could affect tourism
and public security," said Lt. Gen. Hu Chieh, deputy commander of the
Kinmen Defense Command.</P>
      <P>The 12 minefields to be cleared under the three-year plan include
Kuang-ao, Tzuti, Chienkungyu, Hsipien, Mashan and Hsishan.</P>
      <P>Lee said the presence of minefields has discouraged private
corporations from investing in Kinmen and has hindered the island's
economic development over the decades.</P>
      <P>"The MND's three-year demining plan has come too late," Lee said,
adding that given the government's deteriorating financial straits,
the military may have difficulty appropriating enough funds to
finance the demining project.</P>
      <P>With the consent of the Kinmen county council and the support of
Kinmen's civilian residents, Lee said he plans to enlist
international assistance with a view to ridding the island of
dangerous landmines and unexploded ordinance as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>"I earnestly hope that foreign human rights groups and activists
can offer us financial and technological aid in clearing up landmines
in the above-mentioned coastal regions," Lee said.</P>
      <P>With relations across the Taiwan Strait gradually stabilizing,
the MND has demined 16 minefields on Kinmen since 1998 and is
scheduled to launch a new three-year plan from 2006 through 2008 to
clear up 12 other minefields.</P>
      <P>After listening to Lee's and Hu's briefings on the landmine
issues, two Control Yuan members -- Lin Chu-lang and Hsieh Ching-hui
-- recognized the MND's demining drive. Nevertheless, they said they
agreed with Lee's views that the MND's new three-year demining
project should be advanced to help boost Kinmen's tourism and
economic development.</P>
      <P>The two Control Yuan members arrived in Kinmen Thursday to
inspect various development projects on the frontline island.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung City Council Deputy Speaker Tsai
Sung-hsiung was voted Friday by city councilors to serve as an acting
speaker after the speaker was removed from the post for vote-buying
in last year's city council election.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city council called a meeting to decide whether a
new speaker should be elected to fill the vacant post. However,
attending city councilors voted unanimously to have Tsai temporarily
serve in the post left vacant by Chu An-hsiung, as by-elections might
be held soon to replace other councilors who are involved in another
vote-buying scandal on the election of council speakership.</P>
      <P>Thirty-four councilors out of a total of 44 members, including
Chu and Tsai, were indicted in that case.</P>
      <P>Chu was kicked off the council after being sentenced Sept. 25 to
a 22-month jail term for vote-buying during the council election last
December. However, he failed to report to the Kaohsiung District
Court Thursday to begin serving his term. The prosecution authorities
urged Chu to turn himself in before Oct. 20 or face arrest.</P>
      <P>Although Chu's wife Wu Teh-mei gave her assurance in a telephone

    <HEADLINE>MAC TO HOLD PUBLIC HEARINGS TO REVIEW MINI-THREE LINKS POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) said Friday that it will hold a series of public hearings to
review the "mini-three links" between Taiwan's Kinmen and Matsu and
designated harbors in mainland China's Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Chen Ming-tong noted that direct trade, postal
and transport links between the two outlying islands and the
mainland, which were implemented in January 2001, is part of the
nation's overall mainland China policy.</P>
      <P>The hearings are in line with the recent revised regulations of
the Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan
Area and the Mainland Area, which has given a more comprehensive
legal basis for the mini-links.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the MAC will make an overall review of the links,
including shipping links and personnel exchanges and the regulation
of imported goods. It will then make necessary adjustments based on
the overall consideration of local demand, software and hardware
construction, and a balanced consideration of the interests of Taiwan
proper in terms of maintaining security and social stability.</P>
      <P>He said that the development of Kinmen and Matsu should be linked
with that of Taiwan proper as much as possible.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he went on, the government has yet to allow the
mainland real estate sector to advertise in Taiwan and those who
violate the regulations will face fines of between NT$100,000 and
NT$500,000 (US$2,950-US$14,750).</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after the mainland-based Shimao Group
kicked off a three-day promotion in Taipei for a luxurious housing
complex in Shanghai. The group, which aims to sell at around NT$20
million (US$589,970) per unit of the complex, has already placed
prominent advertisements in all Taiwan major news media.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that the mainland real estate sector is not allowed
to come to Taiwan. The sector is prohibited to publish, air or
broadcast ads or conduct promotions in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the Ministry of the Interior is in charge of the
real estate sector and added that the MAC will immediately notify the
ministry so that it can handle the matter.</P>
      <P>This is not the first case of mainland real estate operators
violating the regulations. Three fines have been issued this year,
each of which has amounted to NT$300,000.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 200,000 people are expected to
take part in a rally to be held in Kaohsiung Oct. 25 to push for the
birth of a new constitution in Taiwan, ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the rally, which he described as a
demonstration of Taiwan's progress as well as its democratization,
will be a crucial boost to the success of a referendum, in which the
Taiwan population will vote to decide whether and how a new
constitution should be enacted and promulgated.</P>
      <P>Addressing a press conference called by the Referendum
Legislation Promotion Alliance (RLPA) to drum up support for the Oct.
25 rally, Chang said holding referendums will no longer be "an
impossible dream" for the Taiwan people and that successful holding
of referendums will eventually mark a milestone in Taiwan's
democratization.</P>
      <P>"It is my honor to tell you that about 100,000 people were
originally scheduled to take part in the rally, but the number has
grown to 150,000 and is expected to reach and even exceed 200,000 by
Oct. 25," Chang said.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Trong Chai, one of the major proponents of
referendums in Taiwan, said a torchlight marathon is scheduled to kick
off in Kungliao, Taipei County Oct. 19 as a sideline to the rally.</P>
      <P>Chai said the marathon will kick off at the site of the partially
completed Fourth Nuclear Power Plant, where former DPP Chairman Lin
Yi-hsiung will lead the "north team" of the marathon on a seven-day,
492.3-kilometer run from Taipei County in the north to the southern
port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu is scheduled to lead the "south team"
of the marathon on a three-day, 157-kilometer run from Oluanpi, the
southernmost tip of Taiwan, arriving in Kaohsiung City Oct. 25.</P>
      <P>The runners who finish the last sections of the run will join the
other rally members in the evening of Oct. 25, when the new
constitution rally culminates.</P>
      <P>According to Chai, the DPP will mobilize some 100,000 members and
supporters to take part in the rally, while the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU), a DPP ally, will have some 50,000 people show
up and the Taiwan Presbyterian Church is expected to have some 20,000
people attending.</P>
      <P>Lin Chih-chia, chief secretary of the TSU, which is also
co-sponsoring the rally, said promoting the legislation of a
referendum law is a task that requires cooperation and concerted
efforts from all parties across the political spectrum.</P>

      <P>The four co-chairs of the Congressional
Taiwan Caucus, a pro-Taiwan group in the U.S. House of
Representatives, have introduced a concurrent resolution welcoming
President Chen Shui-bian's upcoming transit stop in New York.</P>
      <P>The resolution says: "(Congress) recognizes that the visit of
Taiwan's President Chen Shui-bian to the United States is a
significant step towards broadening and deepening the friendship and
cooperation between the United States and Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The resolution was jointly initiated by Reps. Robert Wexler

    <HEADLINE>NEW CONSTITUTION DRIVE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH INDEPENDENCE: ENVOY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Bangkok,  Oct.  18 (CNA)
(By Wu Hui-chun and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's representative to the upcoming
informal leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum said Saturday the island's new constitution drive has
nothing to do with its future relations with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tse, who will represent
President Chen Shui-bian at the Oct. 20-21 APEC summit in Bangkok,
made the remarks during a news conference held after his arrival in
the Thai capital.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan needs political reforms to stay competitive in
the world market, Lee said Chen's recent call for writing a new
constitution is mainly aimed at crafting a political framework that
fits Taiwan's present reality.</P>
      <P>Lee stressed that the drive to introduce a new constitution for
Taiwan has nothing to do with the issue regarding whether Taiwan
should seek de jure independence or unify with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Because of Beijing's opposition, Taiwan's president has been
barred from attending the annual APEC summit and has instead had to
name a proxy to attend the meeting on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Lee, a co-winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize in chemistry, said he
hopes to hold talks with mainland Chinese President Hu Jintao on the
sidelines of the APEC summit.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese President Hu will also attend the APEC summit.
"I may have the opportunity to talk with Hu. Should that be the case,
it will be my first encounter with him," Lee said.</P>
      <P>"I feel a little bit curious about Hu, " he said, adding that
if he meets with Hu, he will suggest that Hu sit down to talk with
President Chen to enhance mutual understanding.</P>
      <P>Last year, Lee also represented Chen at the annual APEC
leadership meeting held in Mexico. At that time, Lee recalled that he
had friendly chats with then-mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>Lee said there exists much misunderstanding between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"I hope both sides can shelve their preconditions or presumptions
and sit down to talk first. We should increase contacts and
interaction to forge mutual trust. Despite differences between their
governments, I believe, all individual people on the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait are kind-hearted and have goodwill toward each other, "
Lee added.</P>
      <P>Lee said he feels honored to be able to represent President Chen
at the APEC summit. He added that he will do his utmost to contribute
to Taiwan's cause while attending the APEC activities in Bangkok.</P>
      <P>Lee said Taiwan has actively participated in APEC activities
since it was admitted to the regional economic cooperation forum in
1991 along with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Over the past years, Lee said, Taiwan has contributed much to
helping boost Asia-Pacific regional development, stability and
prosperity.</P>
      <P>Lee said he will take advantage of the summit meeting to exchange
views with top leaders of other APEC member economies on various
regional and global issues. In addition, Lee said, he will also hold
bilateral talks with leaders of some other APEC members on bilateral
trade and economic matters and other topics of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>Among others, Lee said, he hopes to meet with U.S. President
George W. Bush to discuss issues related to the signing of a free
trade agreement between the two countries.</P>
      <P>He said President Chen has not given him any specific
assignments. "Anyway, I'll coordinate with other members of our
delegation to fulfill my mission as Chen's special envoy to the
meeting," he added.</P>
      <P>Many Taiwan businesspeople operating in Thailand and ethnic
Chinese community leaders greeted Lee when he arrived at the Dustin
Thani Hotel. Eight major international news media organizations,
including CNN, Reuters, and Japan's Sankei Shimbun and Asahi Shimbun,
have asked to interview Lee.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COUNCILORS SUGGEST MORE POSITIVE APPROACH BE USED FOR STRAY DOG PROBLEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several Taipei City councilors on Saturday
urged the city government to adopt a more positive approach of
dealing with the stray dog problem than putting the dogs to sleep.</P>
      <P>Councilors Huang Shan-shan, Wang Chi-ping and Wang Hsin-yi made
the remarks after visiting Taipei's animal shelter for stray dogs and
other animals.</P>
      <P>Citing a report by the Taipei Municipal Institute for Animal
Health, Huang said that as of September, Taipei City had a total of
240,000 dogs, with around 110,000 having been implanted with chips.</P>
      <P>Noting that the maximum number of stray dogs that can be
accommodated at the Taipei animal shelter is 380, Huang said that the
shelter has a policy of putting stray dogs to sleep 10 days after
they are rounded up if nobody comes forward to claim them.</P>
      <P>As of September, the Taipei Municipal Institute for Animal Health
had put more than 5,000 stray dogs to sleep and had commissioned
other organizations to put an additional 3,000 stray dogs to sleep.</P>
      <P>The councilors said that Taipei City Government has used a
"passive" approach in dealing with stray animals, suggesting that it
adopt a positive approach.</P>
      <P>They suggested that the city government take the initiative in
investigating dog vendors in night markets and flower markets to
learn the source of their dogs.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taipei City Government has appropriated NT$3,600
(US$106) for the management of each stray dog that enters the animal
shelter, the councilors said that if the city government, based on
humanitarian concerns for the dogs, gave the money to private
shelters in other cities and counties, then the stray dogs could live
six months longer.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Government officials said that they will study the
feasibility of implementing regulations requiring that those selling
dogs only be allowed to do so after implementing the animals with
chips and completing the proper pet registration procedures.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN SAYS POLITICIANS WHO DWELL IN THE PAST UNABLE TO EMBRACE REFORM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that
if political figures only think about themselves and dwell in the
past, they will be fearful of reform and be unable to move forward on
the path of progress with the people.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he addressed the opening of
new classes at the Ketagalan Academy, a school founded by himself and
with the aim of nurturing future leaders of the nation.</P>
      <P>His words were interpreted as being an indirect criticism of his
rivals in the 2000 presidential election, namely Lien Chan, chairman
of the Kuomintang (KMT) , and James Soong, chairman of the People
First Party (PFP) . Chen won the last election by garnering 39.3
percent of the total vote, with Soong trailing close behind and Lien
a distant third. Lien and Soong are teaming up to challenge Chen in
the next presidential election set for March 20, 2004.</P>
      <P>"If political figures only think about themselves, then they will
only be able to dwell in the past and try to cling to their
privileges and position, " the president said, adding that such
political figures "are antagonistic toward reform, fearful of
democracy, and mistrustful of the people." He said that politicians
with this mentality will be unable to move forward with the people
and could even plunge the nation into danger.</P>
      <P>Faced with the nation's woes accumulated over five decades of
authoritarian rule, Chen said, the people have long aspired for
reform, which he said could not be accomplished over the course of a
single presidential term.</P>
      <P>Referring to the 2000 presidential election in which the KMT
regime which had ruled the nation for more than 50 years was swept
out of power, Chen said "we should not unrealistically think that the
problems accumulated over the past five decades can evaporate in one
day."</P>
      <P>"Nor should we expect that those political figures who are
opposed to democracy, reform and progress will suddenly turn around
and become the standard bearers of reform."</P>
      <P>The president made the comments in highlighting his theme of
"reform vs. anti-reform" for his re-election bid in the next
presidential election next March.</P>
      <P>Chen said that "what we should be going after is enlisting more
reform-minded people to join the reform campaign" so that the force
of reform will gain broader support and the nation will be able to
move forward.</P>
      <P>The president also said that the road to reform is long and
winding and the resistance of the anti-reformists is "beyond your
imagination, " but he added that if one cannot bear the pain of
carrying out reform or if one withdraws because of fear of losing
power, then all previous efforts and sacrifices will be washed down
the drain.</P>
      <P>The president noted that many people have asked him why he has
spent so much time and money in setting up the Ketagalan Academy
instead of using them to develop the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), of which he concurrently serves as chairman, or for his
re-election bid.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that he had said at the inauguration of the school
in March of this year that it "is not a DPP school and will not serve
specific individuals, but instead will be open to all people and
serve as a platform for communication and exchanges on democratic
ideals."</P>
      <P>"The significance of the school is to quicken the pace of
Taiwan's democratic reforms," the president said.</P>
      <P>He said that as a figure who has dedicated himself to politics,
his task is to care about the people, and not about his own
interests.</P>
      <P>He said that if political figures think only about the people,
then they will be able to courageously shoulder the reform
responsibilities even if this means having an adverse effect on their
own power and position.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC ENVOY TO APEC SUMMIT ARRIVES IN BANGKOK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Bangkok, Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By Wu Hui-chun and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's representative to the upcoming
informal leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum said Saturday he hopes to hold talks with mainland
Chinese President Hu Jintao on the sidelines of the summit.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tse, who will represent
President Chen Shui-bian at the Oct. 20-21 APEC summit in Bangkok,
made the remarks after his arrival in the Thai capital.</P>
      <P>Because of Beijing's opposition, Taiwan's president has been
barred from attending the annual APEC summit and has instead had to
name a proxy to attend the meeting on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Lee, a co-winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize in chemistry, said he
feels honored to be able to represent President Chen at the APEC
summit. He added that he will do his utmost to contribute to Taiwan's
cause while attending the APEC activities in Bangkok.</P>
      <P>Lee said Taiwan has actively participated in APEC activities
since it was admitted to the regional economic cooperation forum in
1991 along with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Over the past years, Lee said, Taiwan has contributed much to
helping boost Asia-Pacific regional development, stability and
prosperity.</P>
      <P>Lee said he will take advantage of the summit meeting to exchange
views with top leaders of other APEC member economies on various
regional and global issues. In addition, Lee said, he will also hold
bilateral talks with leaders of some other APEC members on bilateral
trade and economic matters and other topics of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>He said President Chen has not given him any specific
assignments. "Anyway, I'll coordinate with other members of our
delegation to fulfill my mission as Chen's special envoy to the
meeting," he added.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese President Hu will also attend the APEC summit.
"I may have the opportunity to talk with Hu. Should that be the case,
it will be my first encounter with him," Lee said.</P>
      <P>"I feel a little bit curious about Hu, " he said, adding that he
hopes to have bilateral talks with him on the sidelines of the APEC
summit.</P>
      <P>Last year, Lee also represented Chen at the annual APEC
leadership meeting held in Mexico. At that time, Lee recalled that he
had friendly chats with then-mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>Lee said there exists much misunderstanding between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"I hope both sides can shelve their preconditions or presumptions
and sit down to talk first. We should increase contacts and
interaction to forge mutual trust. Despite differences between their
governments, I believe, all individual people on the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait are kind-hearted and have goodwill toward each other, "
Lee added.</P>
      <P>Many Taiwan businesspeople operating in Thailand and ethnic
Chinese community leaders greeted Lee when he arrived at Dustin
Thani Hotel. Eight major international news media, including
Japan's Sankei Shimbun and Asahi Shimbun as well as CNN and Reuters,
have asked to interview Lee.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT MATTERS NOT AN ISSUE IN TAIWAN INVESTMENT: VICE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While cross-Taiwan Strait relations is a
factor to be considered in investing in Taiwan, foreign corporations
do not need to take sides between Taiwan and mainland China, Vice
Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-hsiang said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Shih made the remarks at a news conference in response to foreign
journalists' inquiries about the possible impact of cross-strait
relations on foreign business people's willingness to invest in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Forty-one foreign journalists from around the world have traveled
to Taipei to cover the 2003 Taiwan Business Alliance Conference --
the largest investment conference ever held in Taiwan. Many of them
were interested in the latest developments in cross-strait relations
and their possible impact on Taiwan's investment climate and economic
prospects.</P>
      <P>During the news conference where Shih briefed foreign
correspondents on the theme of the Oct. 19-22 investment event, a
correspondent from the French daily Le Figaro asked: "Will Taiwan be
a more attractive investment destination if it forges closer ties
with mainland China?"</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, Shih replied, Taiwan companies have
maintained close interactions with their mainland Chinese
counterparts. And for its part, he continued, the ROC government has
also drawn up a comprehensive blueprint for forging direct
cross-strait transportation links in a step-by-step approach. Shih
said he believes a major breakthrough will be achieved after Taiwan's
next presidential election on March 20, 2004.</P>
      <P>As to how Taiwan can attract foreign investors given mainland
China's "one China" principle, Shih said foreign investors tend to
set their sights on long-term development prospects or potential.</P>
      <P>"Investment involves many factors and is not a simple 'yes or no'
choice. While cross-strait relations may be a factor to be
considered, it's not necessarily a decisive one. More important,
foreign companies do not need to take sides between Taiwan and the
mainland," Shih explained.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan enjoys a large surplus in its trade with mainland
China, foreign journalists were concerned about future cross-strait
trade development.</P>
      <P>Shih said Taiwan companies have invested a large amount of
capital in mainland China. Up to 60 or 70 percent of semiconductors
and LCD products exported from mainland China are manufactured by
Taiwan-funded plants there. Against this backdrop, he said,
cross-strait trade ties will become even closer in the future.</P>
      <P>A reporter from the German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung asked
whether Taiwan's intensive investment promotion drive is aimed at
avoiding being marginalized in the face of gradual economic
integration of Southeast Asian countries and mainland China's "magnet
effect" in attracting foreign capital.</P>
      <P>In response, Shih said Taiwan intends to court high value-added
and high-tech industries. "Our per capita national income is much
higher than mainland China's and ASEAN countries'. Our targets are
different from theirs," he added.</P>
      <P>Some foreign journalists asked about Taiwan's prospects for
signing free trade agreements with other countries. Shih said Taiwan
has signed a free trade pact with Panama and will endeavor to
negotiate similar agreements with major trading partners, including
the United States, Singapore, Japan and European countries. "Trade is
our lifeline. We'll spare no effort in seeking closer trade ties with
other countries."</P>
      <P>Asked whether President Chen Shui-bian's recent call for writing
a new constitution and the ongoing "Call Taiwan, Taiwan" movement
initiated by former President Lee Teng-hui will have an adverse
impact on Taiwan's drive to attract foreign investments, Shih said he
is not in a position to talk about sensitive political issues.
Nevertheless, he said politics should not interfere with economic
activities.</P>

      <P>Chou Mei-li, chief of the Taiwan Advocates' legal affairs

review of the opening policy initiated by the late President Chiang

    <TEXT>
      <P>The curtain was raised on the long-planned
2003 Taiwan Business Alliance Conference at the Taipei International
Convention Center Sunday evening as part of the government's
intensive campaign to attract investment.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said at a news
conference held earlier in the day that 15 world-renowned foreign
companies have agreed to sign investment contracts during the
conference.</P>
      <P>Those companies include Japan's Asahi Glass Co., Toppan Printing
and NTT DoCoMo as well as Corning and Dupont of the United States,
Infineon of Germany and Cerberus Asia Capital Management of Thailand,
Shih said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he added, 13 business groups have announced their
decision to set up research and development (R&amp;D) facilities in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shih briefed local and foreign journalists on the main purposes
of the Oct. 19-22 Business Alliance Conference -- the largest
investment promotion event ever held in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the evening, Premier Yu Shyi-kun hosted a cocktail reception
to welcome the 1,913 prospective investors from Taiwan and abroad on
behalf of the ROC government.</P>
      <P>Shih said that the theme of the meeting is "Invest in Taiwan,
Access the World" with the ultimate aim of helping Taiwan build an
internationally competitive investment climate and to spur sustained
domestic economic growth.</P>
      <P>To ensure the conference is a success, Shih said, government
agencies have made strenuous efforts to push for the realization of
investment projects. In addition to visiting numerous foreign
companies in the past few months to understand their investment
plans, Shih said, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has also
coordinated with other relevant government agencies to resolve
investment obstacles pointed out by foreign business people.</P>
      <P>All those efforts have paid off, Shih said, adding that MOEA has
so far received 186 promised investment projects, with 113 of them,
worth NT$68.22 billion (US$2.02 billion), having been confirmed.</P>
      <P>These projects cover a variety of industries, including finance
and insurance, video display and optoelectronics, telecommunications,
precision machinery, semiconductors, microelectronics, biotechnology
and health care, Shih said.</P>
      <P>"The four industries with the most foreign investment are video
display/optoelectronics, semiconductors/microelectronics,
finance/insurance, and telecommunications," he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Shih said, the 73 promised investment projects will be
worth NT$70.17 billion, with semiconductors/microelectronics,
biotechnology/health care, video display/optoelectronics and
telecommunications expected to bring in the largest amount of
capital.</P>
      <P>Shih said there will also be 290 follow-up investment projects,
worth an estimated NT$94.9 billion, to be launched in Taiwan in the
future.</P>
      <P>With concerted efforts by the central, county and city
governments, Shih said, the four-day business alliance conference has
already attracted foreign investments well over the original target
of NT$100 billion.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Shih said, various government agencies have come up
with a total of 126 public construction projects to be opened for
foreign investments. All these projects will offer more than NT$400
billion worth of business opportunities for prospective foreign
investors, he added.</P>

to review the Executive Yuan's budget plan Monday if it refuses to
correct legal defects as requested by the legislature, opposition
lawmaker Chou Hsih-wei said Sunday.</P>
      <P>With help of other parties, lawmakers from Chou's People First
Party railroaded a resolution through the legislature last week,
demanding that the Executive Yuan take back its budget plan and
correct what the legislators described as legal errors by Monday. The
demand was refused by Premier Yu Shyi-kun, who insisted that there is
nothing inappropriate in the budget.</P>
      <P>Chou said the legislature will not be able to remit the budget
plan to committees for review on Monday as the Executive Yuan has
refused to comply with the Legislative Yuan resolution, a problem for
which the Executive Yuan is to blame.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN APEC ENVOY TO PASS MESSAGE TO U.S. PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Bangkok, Oct. 19 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lee Yuan-tseh, Taiwan's envoy to the Asian
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum's leader's summit, said
Sunday that he hopes to tell U.S. President George Bush that Republic
of China President Chen Shui-bian will honor his promise not to seek
independence.</P>
      <P>In interviews with the international media, the Nobel laureate
and president of Taiwan's Academia Sinica said that if he gets the
opportunity to meet Bush on the sidelines of the APEC meet, he will
tell the U.S. leader that Chen is not a troublemaker and will refrain
from flirting with the idea of seeking permanent separation from
mainland China as he promised in his 2000 inaugural speech.</P>
      <P>Lee was quoted by Lee Cher-jean, a spokeswoman for the Taipei
APEC delegation, as saying in the interview that Lee will also
explain to Bush that Chen's calls for a plebiscite and a new
constitution are efforts to give the public a say in the country's
policy-making and to adapt existing political systems to the reality
of the present situation and as such, do not constitute a breach of
his inaugural promises.</P>
      <P>Lee said he also wants to meet with mainland Chinese President Hu
Jintao to discuss developing democracy and the economy, although he
admitted that the chances of Hu agreeing to such a meeting are slim.</P>
      <P>"Only talks without preconditions can sort out misunderstandings
and improve bilateral ties," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Beijing missed a good chance to reach out to the Taiwan people
earlier this year when Taiwan fell into the grip of severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks, Lee went on.</P>
      <P>Instead of helping Taiwan to fight SARS, Beijing complicated the
country's efforts by thwarting its bid to join the World Health
Organization, said Lee.</P>
      <P>Lee's interview is expected to be broadcast by the BBC on Monday
or Tuesday and will be replayed several times, according to Lee
Cher-jean.</P>
      <P>Lee was appointed by Chen as Taipei's envoy to the APEC summit,
which is off-limits to Taiwan's leaders because of pressure from
Beijing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRADE PACT WITH PANAMA CONCLUDED ACCORDING TO CONSTITUTION: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  19 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian signed a free
trade agreement (FTA) with Panama in August in accordance with all
legal procedures, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Shen Pei-huang, director of the Treaty and Legal Affairs
Department under the MOFA, said his ministry briefed various
political factions at the legislature in February and March and
submitted a report to the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Economic
Affairs Committee at the Legislative Yuan in May.</P>
      <P>The official said all treaty-conclusion procedures provided for
in the Constitution were followed before Chen inked the pact with his
Panama counterpart Mireya Elisa Moscoso in August. The legislature
was not overlooked at all, he added.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks in response to criticism from opposition
lawmaker Hsu Yuan-kuo of the People First Party, who claimed that the
president broke constitutional procedure by inking the pact first
before asking the legislature for ratification.</P>
      <P>DPP whip at the legislature Chen Chih-mai echoed Shen's view,
noting that the Constitution empowers the president to conclude
agreements with other countries while giving the legislature the
power to review any treaty with other countries. However, the
Constitution does not specify which step goes before the other.</P>
      <P>The MOFA and the Economics Ministry informed the economic affairs
and foreign affairs committees of the legislature in February and
May, respectively, about the pact and no party raised any objection
at the time, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The FTA with Panama, inked in Taipei Aug. 21, is the first of its
kind for the country and is touted as a diplomatic feat of the
government, which hopes it will pave the way for similar pacts with
other countries.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S.-based Avnet Electronics Marketing, one
of the world's largest technology, marketing, distribution and
services company, announced Sunday that it will set up a new service
center in Taiwan to meet fast-growing demand in Asia.</P>
      <P>Avnet Electronics Marketing President Andy Bryant said the
company made the decision because it had reached its benchmark goal
of US$1 billion in sales last year, representing an annual growth
rate of 40 percent.</P>
      <P>Avnet is determined to provide the best technology and service to
its clients in Asia and the rest of the world by making increased
investment in personnel and facilities to satisfy Asia's strong
demand. This includes recruiting 70 frontline workers last year to
join the current line-ups in Taiwan and mainland China, Bryant said,
noting the opening of the Taiwan service center will bring to 20 the
number of its offices in the Greater China area.</P>
      <P>Raymond Tsang, head of Avnet Electronics Marketing Asia, said the
current Taiwan team has made an outstanding contribution to the
company's success in the region and added that the mother company
will continue to invest in Taiwan in the face of the booming
developments in the Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland markets.</P>
      <P>Avnet has already opened a logistics hub in Taiwan, one in Hong
Kong and three on the mainland, Tsang noted, adding that the five
logistics centers have markedly shortened the traffic time of
products and provide a sound warehousing environment in Asia.</P>
      <P>The five Asian logistics centers, linked with others in the rest
of the world, offer Avnet clients, including those in Taiwan, a quick
and high-quality service in logistics flow and a warehousing network,
Tsang said.</P>
      <P>Avnet, based in Phoenix, Arizona, is a leading B2B supplier of
interconnections, electro-mechanical and electric components and
material logistic services. Leading world-class companies, such as
IBM, Motorola, Intel, Microsoft and HP are among its clientele.
Business revenue of its 2003 fiscal year (as of June 30) hit US$9.05

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TRIES TO START TALKS WITH U.S. ON FREE TRADE PACT</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will try to explore the possibility
of concluding a free trade agreement (FTA) with the United State when
the two countries talk about a trade and investment framework
agreement (TIFA) , Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Yi-fu said here
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lin, who is attending a ministerial conference of the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, told CNA that Washington has
agreed to resume the TIFA talks with Taiwan next year and that Taipei
intends to include FTA discussions.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Washington started a series of working group-level
talks in October 2002 with a view of starting the TIFA negotiations
in Washington in November that year. But the formal talks never
materialized because of Washington's complaint that Taiwan did not
fully honor promises, which it made when it entered the World Trade
Organization in 2002, concerning protection of intellectual property
rights, opening markets to foreign rice and foreign telecommunication
companies.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has experienced difficulties in its attempts to forge free
trade pacts with countries that do not recognize it, as these
countries are vulnerable to diplomatic pressure from mainland China,
the minister said.</P>
      <P>This situation, however, could change if the United States, which
also does not maintain official ties with Taiwan, takes the lead in
entering into such a pact with Taiwan, Lin went on.</P>
      <P>Lin said his ministry is pleased to learn that Washington has
given a green light to TIFA talks and is trying to convince
Washington to conduct FTA talks at the same time.</P>
      <P>Besides the United States, Lin said Taiwan is trying to push for
similar pacts with Japan, New Zealand and Singapore, Lin added.</P>
      <P>In a bilateral talks on the fringes of the Bangkok conference,
Lin said that Japanese Economic, Trade and Industry Minister Shoichi
Nakagawa agreed to start the process by having private scholars study
the feasibility of such a pact first, with an outcome hopefully by
the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is hoping to set up a joint panel with Singapore to study
the possibility of a FTA and is also approaching New Zealand about
the issue, said Lin.</P>
      <P>Wrapping up the APEC ministerial conference in Bangkok, Lin was
slated to fly back to Taipei later in the day.</P>

      <P>Tunnel-boring work on the Beiyi Freeway was
completed Monday, representing a big step forward in the construction
of the freeway that will link Taipei City and the northeastern county
of Ilan.</P>
      <P>Addressing a ceremony to mark the completion of the boring work,
President Chen Shui-bian claimed that it shows his administration's
efficiency in carrying out public projects, as well as Taiwan's
dynamism and international competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Chen was accompanied by Premier Yu Shyi-kun and Minister of
Transportation and Communications Lin Ling-san to witness the fall of
the last piece of rock in the tunnel prior to the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Officials of the Taiwan Area National Expressway Engineering

difficulties that could be encountered in developing the tunnel have
been overcome.</P>
      <P>The tunneling of the main section of the Shueishan Tunnel will be
finished by next September, smoothing the way for the completion of
the whole project by the end of 2005, they added.</P>
      <P>The 12.9-km Shueishan Tunnel, also known as the "tunnel beneath
troubled waters" because of the engineering difficulties encountered
during its construction, is the centerpiece of the 31-km Beiyi
Freeway project.</P>
      <P>Construction on the project has long been delayed because of the
geological formation of Shueishan (Snow Mountain), through which the
tunnel will pass.</P>
      <P>More than a decade has passed since construction began in 1991.
Boring work has often been halted due to the frequent upwelling of
water at the construction site, as well as mud slides.</P>
      <P>When the freeway is completed, the drive from Taipei to Ilan will
take only 40 minutes, compared to the two hours required at present.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRODUCTION VALUE OF TECHNOLOGY SERVICE SECTOR EXPECTED TO GROW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The production value of the technical and
engineering service sector is expected to grow by between one to two
fold in the next five years, the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB)
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chao-yih, director-general of the IDB, made the remarks when
he presided over a technical and engineering service seminar as part
of the 12 industry seminars of the 2003 Taiwan Business Alliance
Conference.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the ratio of the service sector to the gross
domestic product (GDP) hovered between 40 and 50 percent in the
1950s, and the ratio has risen steadily since. In 1977, with the
conventional industries moving overseas and the government's opening
of indirect investment in mainland China, the ratio of the service
sector in the GDP rose rapidly, with the number shooting up to 67.3
percent, almost on par with industrialized nations, last year.</P>
      <P>The ratio of the technology service sector accounted for between
two to three percent, and the production value of the technical and
engineering service sector is expected to grow by between one and two
fold in five years.</P>
      <P>Liao Jen-hsiang, president of HP Taiwan, said on the same
occasion that looking over the past three decades, Taiwan produced
mainly umbrellas and shoes in the first decade, then moved to PC
production in the second 10 years, and with the deregulation in the
third decade, the telecommunications, banking and financial service
sectors rose rapidly.</P>
      <P>With the transformation of Taiwan in recent years, Liao said that
HP has increased its purchases in Taiwan to reach US$14.5 billion
last year, or more than its sales in Taiwan, and that HP never
dreamed of such success when it first invested in Taiwan 30 years
ago. He said that HP has 140,000 staff worldwide, with Taiwan
accounting for 10 percent.</P>
      <P>One of the participants, Taigi Watanabe, president of Ever Power
Co., said that it is not easy to build a power plant, and that it has
chosen Taiwan for investment because of political stability, good
infrastructure and the high education and banking system. The
company has obtained syndicated loans from more than 20 banks.</P>
      <P>Another participant, Chen Hsin-pu, president of Brambles Group
Cleanaway Taiwan, addressed environmental protection services, saying
that when the Environmental Protection Administration was established
in Taiwan more than 10 years ago, much information was lacking, but
that the transparency of the present government is quite high, which
he said would reduce business risks for manufactures.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the regulations of Taiwan are more comprehensive
than in other developing countries, but expressed the hope that Taiwan
could pass a bill on the use of renewable energy, which he said will
attract more foreign investors.</P>

      <P>Ma also seized the opportunity to introduce the Neihu Science

      <P>Shelton said that she was receptive to Taipei's plan to build a

      <P>Shelton earlier lauded the strengths of Taiwan in its

elements in abundance, Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Yi-fu said
Monday at a summit forum of the 2003 Taiwan Business Alliance
Conference.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's geographic location makes it a convenient jumping-off
point to other places in the region, and the island boasts a very
productive work force. This combination makes Taiwan one of the best
destinations for investment in the world, the minister said.</P>
      <P>He said more than 11 multinational companies have set up research
and development centers in Taiwan while 60 local companies have
established similar centers in Taiwan as of September this year.</P>
      <P>He predicted that three of Taiwan's semiconductor manufacturers
would make it to the world's top-10 by 2006.</P>
      <P>James Worth Bagley, president of Lam Research Corporation, said
his company attaches great importance to Taiwan and put US$13 million
into Taiwan when it set up its R&amp;D center in the Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park in 1996.</P>
      <P>To brace for fierce market competition, Bagley said his company
is spreading its offices around the world to serve customers in
different locations while concentrating its resources in a few places
to conduct research and development. R&amp;D costs account for 25 percent
of the company's revenues, he added.</P>
      <P>Y. T. Du, chairman of Citigroup Global Markets Taiwan Ltd.,
said that the opening of Taiwan's banking market has intensified
competition in the banking industry and forced local
banks to improve their financial health and diversify their financial
products.</P>
      <P>As a result, Du said bank customers in Taiwan can now enjoy
services via their computers anywhere in the world.</P>
      <P>Other prominent participants of the summit included Richard Hill,
president of Novellus Systems, Inc., Theodore M. H. Huang, chairman
of the Chinese National Association of Industry &amp; Commerce, Hajime
Sasaki, chairman of NEC Corp., and Roger Seager, vice president of GE
Aircraft Engines.</P>
      <P>They exchanged views on current global economic developments and
outlooks, and how to plumb investment opportunities in Taiwan while
projecting a global presence.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A foreign business executive participating
in the ongoing 2003 Taiwan Business Alliance Conference said Monday
he hopes the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can establish direct
transportation links as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the conference's first summit forum, Lam Research
Corp. President James Worth Bagley said his company has set up a
regional operations headquarters in Taiwan's Hsinchu Science-based
Industrial Park to explore the promising mainland market.</P>
      <P>"Without direct cross-strait transportation links, our staff
members have to detour to a third place while traveling to major
mainland Chinese cities such as Shanghai and Fuzhou, " Bagley said,
adding that the detour is inconvenient and time consuming.</P>
      <P>Bagley said business people usually do not like to touch on
sensitive political issues. "But we hope direct cross-strait shipping
and air services can open as early as possible to facilitate our
business operations," he added.</P>
      <P>Foreign and local business executives present at the meeting all
applauded Bagley's call.</P>
      <P>In reply, Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Yi-fu, who presided
over the summit forum, said the ROC government has completed a
comprehensive evaluation of the impact of opening cross-strait
transportation links.</P>
      <P>"We'll make every possible effort to push for an early opening of
direct cross-strait transportation links, but we need mainland
China's cooperation in realizing this goal," he added.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou went to the

projects in his city.</P>
      <P>Mayor Ma stopped in at the Taipei city exhibition booths, which
were just two of the many on the sidelines of the 2003 Taiwan
Business Alliance Conference that formally began Oct. 20.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the Taipei booths were offering 10 investment
projects worth a total of NT$60 billion (US$1.76 billion) . He said
that although the monetary value of the investments was not great,
many investors had shown interest in them.</P>
      <P>He cited the example of a cable car project in Peitou, suburban
Taipei, being offered using the build-operate-transfer (BOT) format,
adding that 28 keen manufacturers have asked for more information.</P>
      <P>In addition, he also spoke of the development project of a
three-star business in the Hsinyi district, where Taipei

confortable accommodations as well as a good location for doing
business.</P>
      <P>Ma said that Taipei City is developing a biotechnology sector and
is engaging in the research and development for the information
industry. This dovetails with the government's "two-trillion, twin
stars" project, which refers to the production value target of NT$1
trillion (US$29.41 billion) for the semiconductor and color imaging
sectors respectively, while the twin star industries are digital
content and biotechnology.</P>
      <P>Ma also said that many manufacturers are now based in the Neihu

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Senior foreign corporate executives
participating in the ongoing 2003 Taiwan Business Alliance Conference
said Monday they will use Taiwan as a springboard to tap into the
promising greater Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the conference's first summit forum, many senior
foreign business executives, including James Worth Bagley, president
of Lam Research Corp., and Roger N. Seager, vice president of GE
Aircraft Engines said they attach great importance to the greater
Chinese market that covers mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and
Macau and intend to use Taiwan as a stepping stone to this booming
market.</P>
      <P>The forum was presided over by Minister of Economic Affairs Lin
Yi-fu.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Theodore M. H. Huang, president of Chinese
National Industries and Commerce, said many U.S. and Japanese
companies have invested in mainland China and that some of them have
invited their Taiwan counterparts to cooperate in launching new
ventures there.</P>
      <P>Huang said he is interested in seeing what Taiwan's and mainland
China's roles will be in foreign business groups' future investment
plans.</P>
      <P>In response, Bagley said Lam, one of the world's leading wafer
manufacturing firms, set up a branch in Taiwan in 1993. In 1996, it
opened a subsidiary in the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park and
later set up a research and development (R&amp;D) facility in the park
worth US$13 million.</P>
      <P>Bagley said Lam's Taiwan subsidiary has since flourished, with
its annual business turnover expected to reach US$140 million this
year. He said Lam has set up production lines in mainland China in
recent years, with Taiwan as its regional operations hub.</P>
      <P>Of Lam's 1,900 employees around the world, Bagley said, 190 of
them are working in the greater Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has talented and diligent manpower resources,
Bagley said Lam has been using Taiwan's abundant talent pool in
expanding its mainland operations.</P>
      <P>Novellus Systems Inc. CEO Richard S. Hill said he shares similar
views with Bagely, saying that Taiwan has abundant brainpower in
developing information-technology industries and other high-tech
items.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Seager said GE has consistently
attached great importance to the greater Chinese market in its global
business development drive. In terms of production, he said, Taiwan
and mainland China can complement each other. He also said that GE
will use Taiwan as a springboard in expanding its mainland market
share.</P>
      <P>NEC Corp. Chairman Hajime Sasaki said his company will use
mainland China as its future production base because the mainland has
cheap labor. He said Taiwan should focus on developing
knowledge-based industries in its next stage of development.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is a perfect place to invest in,
given its key geographic position in Asia and the Pacific, its
advanced infrastructure, and its highly skilled work force, Foreign
Minister Eugene Chien said Monday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a luncheon for participants of the 2003 Taiwan
Business Alliance Conference, the minister boasted of the country's
economic resilience, saying that the world economy was adversely
affected by the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States
and the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome earlier this
year in Asia.</P>
      <P>Through it all, however, Taiwan's economy has remained stable, he
said. Economic growth for the third and fourth quarters of 2003 is
set to reach 3.96 percent and 4. 67 percent respectively, said the
minister, noting that the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development even listed Taiwan as a "first-grade, newly
industrialized economy."</P>
      <P>Not content with that, Chien said, the country is creating new
opportunities by introducing the "Challenge 2008 -- National
Development Plan" with a budget of US$75 billion, in the hope of
creating more opportunities for business and trade.</P>
      <P>The minister said he hopes the conference will help the
participants learn more about Taiwan's advances in hi-tech industries
and Taiwan's investment competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The three-day conference opened in Taipei Oct. 19 to woo foreign
investments and has brought together more than 1,900 business leaders

    <HEADLINE>KINMEN, MATSU INVESTMENT ON CHINESE MAINLAND EXCEEDS NT$1.5 B.: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Residents of the frontline islands of Matsu
and Kinmen have been active investors in mainland China, with their
total investment there reaching between NT$1.5 billion-NT$4 billion
(US$44.25 million-US$118 million), Taiwan's top mainland China policy
planner said Monday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) , said Kinmen and Matsu residents have been investing
lavishly in mainland China, particularly in buying homes and real
estate.</P>
      <P>The investment has basically been "one-way, " with very little
money from the mainland being invested in the two offshore islands,
Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Tsai made the remarks at a Legislative Yuan Home and Nation
Committee meeting.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Legislator Hsieh Ming-yuan from the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party asked Tsai about why Kinmen and Matsu
have continued to lose their glamour and attraction while business
there has kept declining since the government initiated the "mini
three links" two years ago to help boost bilateral exchanges between
the two outlying islands and mainland China's Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>The "mini three links, " which came into effect in January 2001,
refers to direct trade, postal and shipping links between Kinmen and
Matsu and Fujian Province's port cities of Xiamen and Fuzhou.</P>
      <P>Tsai responded by saying the MAC is in charge of formulating
Taiwan's policies toward mainland China but is not responsible for
economic development in Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>She attributed the decline being witnessed in Kinmen and Matsu
mainly to the scaling back of the number of ROC military personnel
stationed there and to the "one-way" flow of capital from the two
offshore islands to the mainland.</P>
      <P>She also noted that the "mini three links" program was just a
measure to assist certain areas and that the question of whether to
open the "direct three links" -- namely direct trade, postal and
transportation links between Taiwan proper and mainland China --
needs to be studied further.</P>
      <P>In related news, it has been learned that several legislators
from different political parties will lead a demonstration rally in
Taipei Oct. 24 to push the government to allow Kinmen and Matsu
immigrants in Taiwan to travel to the mainland via the "mini three
links" channel to help facilitate travel during Chinese New Year and
other major national holidays.</P>
      <P>Currently, only residents in Kinmen and Matsu are allowed to
travel to and from Fujian Province via the "mini three links"
channel.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FINANCE MINISTRY PROPOSES STRICTER PENALTIES TO DEAL WITH ATM THEFT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) has hammered
out stricter measures to help deal with the problem of thefts from
ATM machines and other financial crimes, the head of the MOF Bureau
of Monetary Affairs said Monday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan Committee of Financial
Affairs, Tseng Kuo-lieh, director-general of the Bureau of Monetary
Affairs, said the MOF has proposed much more severe penalty terms in
a draft amendment to the existing Banking Law in an effort to ensure
swift crisis management over the recent spate of thefts from ATM
machines islandwide as well as other related crimes.</P>
      <P>The more severe punishments that have been drafted are designed
not only to help crack down on ATM thefts but also to held restore
financial order and rebuild the Taiwan public's trust, Tseng said.</P>
      <P>The stricter punishments which were hammered out after Premier Yu
Shyi-kun instructed the MOF on Oct. 15 to come up with more effective
measures to deal with the problem of fraudulent cash withdrawals and
related crimes in light of the spate of thefts from ATM machines
islandwide earlier in October.</P>
      <P>These stricter penalty terms will be added to a draft bill
concerning the amendments to the Banking Law and six other financial
and monetary statutes that have been submitted to the Legislative
Yuan. Premier Yu on Oct. 15 also called for the early passage of the
draft bill.</P>
      <P>According to Vice Minister of Finance Chang Hsiu-lian, 257
account holders at 24 banks, half of them being Bank of Taiwan
branches, have been the victim of ATM thefts to the tune of a total
of more than NT$30 million.</P>
      <P>Upon investigation, police have found hidden cameras and IC chips
at several ATMs which have apparently been used by criminals to scan
the data of ATM card holders, allowing them to duplicate the cards
and withdraw money from the card holders' accounts.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan said Monday that
harsher law enforcement measures against counterfeit credit card
rings have evidently borne fruit in recent months as the total value
of purchases made using counterfeit or stolen credit cards has
declined compared to previous years.</P>
      <P>Quoting tallies from the United Credit Card Service Center, Chen
said the total value of purchases made using counterfeit or stolen
credit cards was between NT$150 million and NT$17 million for the
first half of this year, compared with the record high of NT$3.2
billion for the whole of 2000.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"Taiwan is ready, the world is welcome to
invest in us, " President Chen Shui-bian said at the opening of the
2003 Taiwan Business Alliance Conference in Taipei on Monday.</P>
      <P>Speaking to more than 1,900 global business leaders, Chen said
Taiwan's economy has already made the transition from an
agricultural country to a logistics hub for the information
industry. Glancing through the history of Taiwan's economic
development, Chen said that in the 16th century, the Spaniards, the
Dutch and others coming from Europe began to use Taiwan as a
maritime center for ship docking, transactions, and transshipments.</P>
      <P>At that time, thanks to its superior geographic location, Taiwan
was already performing the role of an East Asian transshipment
center. Today, the island of Taiwan, thanks to the hard work and
unrelenting efforts of its people, has accumulated abundant foreign
reserves and high-quality R&amp;D capabilities, as well as ample
high-tech manufacturing capabilities, he said..</P>
      <P>"It is for these reasons that Taiwan, amid fierce international
competition, has already established the prerequisites for
outperforming its competitors and has won the recognition and
affirmation of international public opinion," the president said.</P>
      <P>He cited reports by several influential international economic
research institutes to showcase Taiwan's investment environment and
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Firstly, he said that the Lausanne-based International Institute
for Management Development (IMD) in its World Competitiveness
Yearbook 2003, ranked Taiwan sixth among economies larger than 20
million people.</P>
      <P>The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) in Great Britain has
upgraded its evaluation of Taiwan's business environment for the next
five years from "good" to "very good." In the EIU's latest business
environment ranking, Taiwan ranked 18th worldwide and third in Asia,
he said.</P>
      <P>In the investment climate rating by Swiss-based Business
Environment Risk Intelligence (BERI) , Taiwan tied for fourth place
with Japan. At the same time BERI forecasts that Taiwan will overtake
Japan in 2008.</P>
      <P>Taiwan showed an even more outstanding performance in a global
e-government ranking by Brown University of the United States, taking
the top spot for the second year in a row, the president said.</P>
      <P>"All this only shows that the government's efforts in recent
years to improve the investment climate have begun to pay off, " Chen
said.</P>
      <P>The president also said that to bring a global wave of corporate
investments to Taiwan, the government adopted the "Taiwan First
Investment Incentive Program" in November of last year, which calls
for using preferential land rent schemes for industrial districts and
state land to lower land use costs.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the government has been working actively to attract
international capital and to encourage multinational corporations to
establish R&amp;D centers and operations headquarters in Taiwan by
providing investment tax credits and payroll and rent subsidies for
foreign-owned R&amp;D centers, and incentives such as exemption from the
for-profit enterprise income tax for multinationals.</P>
      <P>He said that in July this year, the government scrapped the US$3
billion ceiling on investments in the local stock market by qualified
foreign institutional investors (QFII) and also opened participation
in the domestic Securities Borrowing and Lending Market.
Subsequently, the Legislative Yuan passed a number of important
financial bills to help with the liberalization of the local
financial and monetary markets.</P>
      <P>"All of these measures will contribute to the liberalization of
Taiwan's investment climate, while perfecting the basic
infrastructure to make our financial system more robust, " the
president said.</P>
      <P>With regard to Taiwan's relations with mainland China, Chen said
he has been sincere calling for an improvement in cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Saying that he proposed in August a three-stage plan for direct
transportation links, Chen said that after next year's presidential
election, negotiations on direct links should be launched smoothly,
based on a process of equality, mutual respect and cooperation, and
that before the end of next year, measures leading to the
establishment of direct links should be progressively realized and
negotiations on direct cross-strait links completed.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Chen said that in early September the government
officially announced the "facilitation of air cargo, " which would
allow Taiwan's carriers to fly to Shanghai with " scheduled charter
flights" using current routes that stop over in Hong Kong or Macao.
The concept is currently still waiting for a positive response from
mainland China.</P>
      <P>As to his call for an unprecedented national referendum next
year, Chen said it is a measure aimed to cement the country's
democracy rather than provoking the long-standing dispute of whether
the country should seek permanent separation from mainland China, and
will not contradict the promise he made in his 2000 inaugural speech
of not seeking independence.</P>
      <P>"Peace across the Taiwan Strait depends on the wisdom and efforts
of people on both sides of it, " he said, adding that worldwide
investors should have confidence in Taiwan, its democracy, and in its
determination to push through with reforms.</P>
      <P>He cautioned investors around the world that mainland China,
instead of being the world's last word in investment, is a place with
a government-controlled economy ruled by the whims of its leader,
and, therefore, replete with unforeseen risks.</P>
      <P>Saying that both the Taiwan government and its people have long
been well-prepared to welcome companies from around the globe to
operate in Taiwan, the president called on the international business
community to seize the chance to invest in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HAS EDGE TO DEVELOP ITSELF INTO R&amp;D BIOMEDICAL HUB IN ASIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Executives from the biomedical field said
Monday that Taiwan possesses several advantages that will give it the
edge in developing itself into an Asian biomedical R&amp;D hub.</P>
      <P>The executives, including Hardy W. Chan, executive vice president
and chief scientific officer of ScinoPharm Taiwan; Daniel Lee,
President and CEO of Apex Medical Corp.; Thomas Shen, president and
CEO of Apex Biotechnology Corp.; and Wang Chang-yi, president and CEO
of United Biomedical Inc. made the remarks when he attended a seminar
on Biomedical and Health Care as part of the 2003 Taiwan Business
Alliance Conference.</P>
      <P>They concurred that government incentives, low production costs,
research and development capacity, protection of intellectual
property rights (IPRs) , the common language used in Taiwan and
mainland China, and its geographic location have all given Taiwan the
edge to become a biomedical R&amp;D center in Asia, as well as to become
a springboard to the mainland Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Chan said that since ScinoPharm opened its plant in Taiwan six
years ago, it has seen the government offer various incentives on R&amp;D
and investment projects.</P>
      <P>Chan also spoke highly of Taiwan people's diligence and R&amp;D
capacity. Compared with the United States and European countries,
Taiwan has lower production costs, high-quality pharmaceutical
production capacity, he said, adding that he was confident of the
prospects for ScinoPharm in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chan stressed that major manufacturers have established footholds
in Asia one by one because the human resources there and production
costs are comparatively cheaper. Comparatively, Taiwan has highly
trained people. This coupled with its advantages in language and
geography, can make it the operations center for foreign businessmen
wanting to set a foothold in Asia.</P>
      <P>He also reminded other manufacturers, that no matter how high the
production efficiency in mainland China may be, its protection of
intelectual property is insufficient.</P>
      <P>He suggested those keen on investing in the mainland focus their
production in mainland China while putting their R&amp;D departments in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Daniel Lee said that health care is growing rapidly in Asian
markets, adding that from the experience of Taiwan industry
cooperating with other major manufacturers in the past, Taiwan
industry already has the capacity to supply stable quality products
and possess the capacity of operations management.</P>
      <P>This will make Taiwan a suitable location for manufacturers to
set up their operations center in Taiwan in their quest to break into
the mainland market, Lee said, adding that the potential of household
health care in Taiwan is quite great.</P>
      <P>Shen said that the Taiwan government has attached great
importance to the biomedical industry, and has offered many
incentives, including subsides and cash awards, for its development.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that Long Island-based United Biomedical Inc. set up
its R&amp;D center in Taiwan to develop foot-and-mouth disease vaccines
and other products, saying that it decided to set up the center
mainly because Taiwan promoted high technology, and that Taiwan also
excels in the telecommunications and electronics industries.</P>
      <P>Wang also said that mainland China has not attached importance to
intellectual property rights and that this is the reason why United
Biomedical did not want to put its R&amp;D center in the mainland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN REAFFIRMS VOW TO TURN TAIWAN INTO REGIONAL BUSINESS HUB</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed his
administration's determination Tuesday to develop Taiwan into a
regional R&amp;D center and business operations hub for major
corporations from around the world.</P>
      <P>Chen made the statement in a speech delivered at a dinner party
hosted by the Executive Yuan in recognition of the more than 2, 000
corporate executives and prospective investors who participated in
the Oct. 19-22 2003 Taiwan Business Alliance Conference.</P>
      <P>In the face of fierce international competition, Chen said Taiwan
will use its robust capital market, high-quality manpower, innovative
technology, strategic geographic location and administrative
efficiency to turn Taiwan into an R&amp;D and testing center in Asia and
a regional sourcing and operations hub.</P>
      <P>Before the curtain was raised on the largest investment promotion
conference ever held in Taiwan, Chen said the confirmed and promised
amount of new investments in Taiwan had already reached NT$138
billion, far exceeding the original target of NT$100 billion.</P>
      <P>During the past two days, Chen said, 28 additional investment
contracts have either been signed or confirmed, including contracts</P>
      <P>between Taiwan's state-owned Aerospace Industrial Development
Corp. (AIDC) and America's Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. and Boeing
Co.</P>
      <P>Under those contracts, AIDC will collaborate with Bell in
offering services in maintenance, remodeling and upgrading of
military helicopters as well as in becoming a supplier of landing gear
doors for Boeing's next-generation 737 airplanes. "These two
contracts mark significant steps in the development of our aerospace
industry," Chen said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said, one of the world's leading printing
industry companies from Quebec, Canada will cooperate with local
companies in building an Asia-Pacific media transmission and
logistics center in Taoyuan County's Chungli industrial park in
northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The investment projects confirmed or signed during the business
alliance conference cover a wide range of industries, including
optoelectronics, aerospace, telecommunications, semiconductors,
energy resources development, biotechnology, banking and insurance,
and warehousing and distribution, Chen said.</P>
      <P>"These projects fully indicate the diversity and vibrancy of our
economic structure and showcase the achievements of Taiwan's
industrial transformation and upgrading in recent years, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>The conference also helped convince 15 world-class multinational
groups, including Hewlett-Packard, Sony, Dell, IBM, Microsoft and
Ericsson, to set up R&amp;D and technical centers in Taiwan, Chen said,
adding that their intentions affirm Taiwan's efforts to encourage
innovation and research.</P>
      <P>More important, Chen said, their actions signify their support
and recognition of Taiwan's liberal, democratic and open society and
lifestyle.</P>
      <P>Chen said his administration will accelerate further reforms and
market deregulation in response to the demand of foreign investors.
"We'll speed up globalization under the principle of 'Invest in
Taiwan, Access the World' to accelerate economic recovery and sustain
growth," he added.</P>
      <P>The business alliance conference has opened up the door for
investment in Taiwan and has helped introduce Taiwan's political,
economic and industrial achievements to the world.</P>
      <P>For years, President Chen said the American Chamber of Commerce
(AmCham) in Taipei, the European Chamber of Commerce Taipei (ECCT)
and the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (JCCI) in Taipei
have contributed much to promoting bilateral trade and economic
relations.</P>

      <P>Although faced with stiff opposition by Beijing, the officials

    <HEADLINE>NUMBER OF NEW JOBS ON RISE: EVTA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 21 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of jobs being offered by Taiwan
companies is growing in the domestic market, Employment &amp; Vocational
Training Administration (EVTA) Director General Kuo Fong-yu said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Thanks to an economic pick up in Taiwan's opto-electronic,
semiconductor and telecommunications industries as a result of a
global economic upturn, domestic traditional, financial, service and
construction businesses also have bottomed out of the recession,
helping create more jobs, said Kuo.</P>
      <P>Citing information provided by a Web site run by the EVTA, Kuo
said the number of job opportunities released by domestic businesses
during the June-September period rose by between 8 percent and 10
percent per month, while about 20 percent of job seekers were able to
find jobs through the Web site.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the number of job seekers fell from 48,725 to
45,048 during the same three-month period, he noted, attributing the
drop to the effect of an employment-boosting package launched by the
Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>According to Kuo, the Web site, which began operations six months
ago to serve as a direct channel between the government and job
seekers and headhunting businesses, is aimed at assisting mainly the
small and service-oriented businesses as well as underprivileged
groups and job seekers with only senior high school degrees.</P>
      <P>Kuo claimed that as many as 90 percent of the Web site's visitors
are satisfied with its services, while 80 percent said they feel the
site is safe in terms of protecting personal privacy.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, statistics compiled by the EVTA Web site show that
about 62.6 percent of the enterprises listed on the site have most
demand for middle- and high-level management personnel, skilled
technicians and sales personnel aged between 30 and 49.</P>
      <P>Only 0.57 percent of the companies do not mind recruiting young
people with no previous experience, while only 3.24 percent are
willing to hire workers aged between 25 and 29 who previous employers
have criticized as changing jobs too frequently.</P>
      <P>In an effort to reduce the high joblessness rate among local
young people, the EVTA, in cooperation with the Council for Economic
Planning and Development and the National Youth Commission, has begun
encouraging businesses, using government subsidies as bait, to hire
unemployed young job seekers on a short-term basis to help them gain
some experience and get full-time work.</P>
      <P>According to the EVTA, job seekers are most interested in
administrative work, although sales offers the largest number of
jobs.</P>
      <P>According to the EVTA survey, most Taiwan companies have no
preference for men over women, which EVTA claimed is evident in that
the number of jobs offered for men are only 5 percent higher than
those offered for women.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE PRESIDENT TOUTS BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"Some may consider the Taiwan Strait a spot
with tension and hostility. But in our eyes, this is an area full of
business opportunities, " said ROC Vice President Annette Lu Tuesday
at the 2003 Taiwan Business Alliance Conference.</P>
      <P>"Our message is clear: We want peace, not war, " Lu said in a
speech delivered at a luncheon hosted by the Ministry of Finance for
hundreds of conference attendees from around the world.</P>
      <P>Noting that the people of Taiwan have lived under the constant
and immense threats and bullying from mainland China over the past
years, Lu said the fundamental difference between the two sides
actually lies in the different views regarding human rights,
individual freedoms and political systems.</P>
      <P>"It is the 'basic values' that make the two societies different,"
Lu stressed.</P>
      <P>In her view, Lu said, the ultimate goal of peace is unattainable
"unless you can reach both democracy and prosperity."</P>
      <P>Fortunately, she said, Taiwan has been able to achieve all three
goals of democracy, peace and prosperity.</P>
      <P>Lu also explained her "soft power" governing concepts, saying
that human rights, democracy, peace, love and technology are the five
key elements in ruling a country. They are also intangible common
assets of mankind.</P>
      <P>In the 21st century, Lu said, military muscle and capital cannot
determine a country's supremacy; instead, this depends on a nation's
contribution to promoting the five key elements.</P>
      <P>Lu said Taiwan is willing to bring its experiences into play for
the benefit of all mankind.</P>
      <P>"As a result, I'm now preparing to organize the Democratic
Pacific Union, a non-governmental organization committed to enhancing
greater cooperation among democracies in the Pacific in the areas of
governance, human security, economic prosperity and ocean
development," Lu said.</P>
      <P>Over the past decades, Lu said Taiwan has created many miracles.
Economic prosperity is not Taiwan's only achievement, Lu said, adding
that Taiwan has made equally admirable progress in political
democratization.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's economic performance and efficiency has been highly
valued by major international economic organizations, " Lu said,
citing as an example the 2003 Global Competitiveness Report, released
by the World Economic Forum, that rates Taiwan's growth
competitiveness as the third best in the world.</P>
      <P>Touching on Taiwan's national development plan, Lu said Taiwan
will focus its industrial development strategies on technological R&amp;D
as well as innovation.</P>
      <P>"On the one hand, we'll strengthen the base of those industries
that have already achieved a leading position, especially
semiconductors and LCD monitors, to enable them to make it among the
top three of the world and exert a strong global influence," Lu said.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, she continued, Taiwan wants to use its
technological innovation and good living environment as capital to
integrate the innovative resources of the Asia-Pacific region with
the rest of the world and seize the opportunity of globally emerging
new star industries in the digital and biotechnological fields.</P>
      <P>Lu further said Taiwan is now implementing a number of financial
reforms.</P>
      <P>"Strengthening corporate governance and transparency are just a
few of our reform efforts. In addition, we are continuously
eliminating previous restrictions in order to roll out more new
financial products," Lu said.</P>
      <P>She added that the Oct. 19-22 business alliance conference is the
largest-ever investment promotion event held in Taiwan and is part of
the government's efforts to attract investments to upgrade Taiwan's
competitiveness in the era of globalization.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The 2003 Taiwan Business Alliance
Conference in Taipei has attracted investments of more than NT$130
billion (US$3.82 billion) so far, far exceeding expectations, Vice
Premier Lin Hsin-i said Tuesday after the final day of the
conference.</P>
      <P>The vice premier, reporting at the Legislative Yuan, said that
preparations for the conference were begun last November, and that he
was happy to say that from January to the present, foreign investment
in Taiwan has reached NT$68.2 billion. Add to this promised
investments of NT$70.2 billion and the figure swells to NT$138.4
billion, far more than the original estimate of NT$100 billion.
Lin, who concurrently serves as the chairman of the Council For
Economic Planning and Development, also said that the government is
now aiming to secure additional investments of more than NT$90
billion, adding that the result will definitely be better than
expected.</P>
      <P>Legislator Kao Meng-ting of the ruling Democratic Progressive

soliciting foreign investment, although he also pointed out that the

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN  MUST  STEP  UP FINANCIAL  REFORMS  TO STAY  COMPETITIVE: GMAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  21 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan must step up financial reforms to
stay competitive, GMAC Commercial Holding Chairman Scot B. Barker
said in Taipei Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the 2003 Taiwan Business Alliance Conference's second
summit forum, Barker said most Asian countries want to attract
foreign investors; however, only with a transparent financial and
economic system can this be achieved. He said that Taiwan must
accelerate financial reforms given that many of its manufacturing
companies have relocated to mainland China and Southeast Asian
countries.</P>
      <P>In his view, Barker said, financial reforms, improving operating
efficiencies and manpower cultivation are priority tasks Taiwan must
accomplish to sustain its economic growth and maintain its niches in
the world market.</P>
      <P>As an important step, Barker said, Taiwan must cut the number of
players in each sub-sector. For example, Taiwan now has more than 50
banks. The number is too large. Taiwan's government should adopt
measures to facilitate mergers and differentiation between healthy
and troubled banks.</P>
      <P>Barker also called for raising standards for underwriting and
risk management for local banks and internationalizing management of
local banks.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Barker said, Taiwan should improve the efficiency of
the financial services sector and ensure that funds go to businesses
based on merit.</P>
      <P>Equally important is to reduce local banks' non-performing loan
(NPL) ratios, Barker said, adding that Taiwan can learn from other
countries' experience in addressing NPL issues.</P>
      <P>Barker said Taiwan's recent passage of an asset securitization
law has paved the way for NPLs to become a new industry that could
create an annual trading volume of US$1.2 billion for Taiwan. It
would also allow financial institutions to realize exits on selected
portfolios.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Barker said Taiwan should speed up formation of an RTC
fund to allow government injection of capital into troubled banks and
facilitate resolution of the NPL issue.

    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior World Trade Organization (WTO)
official has praised highly the performance of Taiwan and mainland
China in the WTO, saying that the two sides played "important and
statesmanlike" roles in the recently concluded WTO Ministerial
Conference in Cancun, Mexico.</P>
      <P>Since both sides of the Taiwan Strait entered the organization
last year, their interaction has been a focus of all member countries
and WTO Secretariat officials.</P>
      <P>In the first ever public speech on Taiwan and mainalnd China's
memberships by a WTO official, Keith Rockwell, director of
information and media relations of the WTO, emphasized the positive
effect of the two sides' memberships.</P>
      <P>"Both new members have been active in the work of the WTO, " said
Rockwell in his speech, titled "China and Chinese Taipei: the
Challenge that Confronts them and all Members of the WTO, " delivered
earlier this week at a symposium organized by the School of Oriental
and African Studies, University of London. He added that both have
made important contributions to the Doha Development Agenda
negotiations.</P>
      <P>Although admitting that there has been a degree of controversy
linked to the two since they joined the WTO and that they have
engaged in an ongoing dispute over "nomenclature," Rockwell indicated
that they have entered the WTO in "remarkably smooth fashion" and
have taken a pragmatic approach to membership by "keeping unnecessary
political questions out of the way."</P>
      <P>He also noted that there has been some criticism that mainland
China has not moved quickly enough in opening its markets to
agriculture imports, and foreign insurance, banking and distribution
companies.</P>
      <P>Despite these existing issues, Rockwell seemed very upbeat about
Taiwan and mainland China's introductions into the WTO, noting that
it is the consensus view that membership for these trading powers has
been a "extremely positive" development, both for mainland China and
Taiwan and for those doing business with them.</P>

      <P>Yu praised Chang for his excellent performance and
professionalism demonstrated in his career as a public functionary.</P>
      <P>Yu said that he believed Chang will make an ideal chief of the
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) after an assessment for
more than two weeks since he served as acting EPA chief after former
EPA administrator Hau Lung-bin resigned Oct. 6.</P>
      <P>Hau tendered his resignation because he didn't see eye to eye
with the premier on referendum issues.</P>
      <P>Hau said the premier rejected his suggestion to exclude
environmental related issues which had already passed environmental
impact assessments from issues which could be put to a referendum.</P>
      <P>Chang said at a news conference held after his appointment that
he will continue to carry out "good policies" set by his predecessor
because he believes that the policies on environmental protection
should be consistent.</P>
      <P>Chang said that he has no prejudgment on a referendum of the fate
of the country's Fourth Nuclear Power Plant that is currently under
construction and whether or not to reopen environmental assessments
for the plant as well as for opening the service ramp at Pinglin on
the Beiyi Expressway that links Taipei City and the northeastern
county of Ilan. The expressway under construction is expected to be
completed by 2005.</P>

      <P>Gary Wang, founder of Taiwan-based Eastern
Multimedia Group, was re-elected chairman of the Republic of China
Chamber of Commerce Wednesday.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian congratulated Wang's recent election as
a member of the international board of directors by the U.S. Academy
of Television Arts and Sciences, and hailed his successful
introduction of Eastern Multimedia Group to the U.S. market.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that the economic development on Taiwan has been
particularly difficult in the past few years due to the global
economic recession, the 911 terrorist attacks in the United States,
and the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) on the
island.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, Wang added, thanks to the efforts made by the Chen
administration in stimulating confidence in Taiwan's investment
environment, the island's economy is recovering.</P>
      <P>The media tycoon said that Taiwan, which boasts one of the best
workforces in the world and has an excellent geographic location, has
been ranked by Business Environment Risk Intelligence (BERI) as the
fourth most attractive place for investment in its report conducted
earlier this year.</P>
      <P>In addition, the world's largest chipmaker Intel and Phoenix
Technologies, the largest supplier of basic input and output systems
(BIOS) in the world, have established their research and development
centers in Taiwan, reflecting the great potential for Taiwan's
development, Wang added.</P>
      <P>He said he believes that the ongoing six-year National
Development Plan "Challenge 2008" initiated by the Cabinet, which
includes the promotion of digital content, adult learning and a
program aimed at doubling the number tourist arrivals, will usher

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC armed forces will support whatever
constitution may be legally enacted and will not favor any political
party in the upcoming presidential election, Vice Minister of
National Defence Lin Chong-pin told the legislature Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin, who led a group of top brass to report to the Legislative
Yuan on how the armed forces will remain politically neutral in the
upcoming presidential election, assured lawmakers that the armed
forces will not show a preference for any political party.</P>
      <P>He cautiously steered clear of the controversy over President
Chen Shui-bian's call for a new constitution, saying that the armed
forces pledges its loyalty to the Republic of China and will follow
whatever constitution is enacted through a proper legal process.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure that the armed forces are not involved in
politics, Lin said the Ministry of National Defense issued a decree
in 2002 forbidding active military personnel, including military
academy cadets, from participating in activities of any political
party or faction.</P>
      <P>The Armed Forces Reserve Command, which used to recall reservists
in the run-up to elections and use them to canvass votes for the
ruling party when the country was ruled by the Kuomintang, will stop
all recalls from Oct. 1 to election day on March 20 to avoid the
military event being used for political purposes, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The defense ministry cannot prevent President Chen Shui-bian, who
is the supreme commander of the country's armed forces, from speaking
to soldiers during the run-up to the election, although Chen is
seeking re-election, according to General. Chen Pang-chih, director
for the Political Warfare Bureau under the defense ministry.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Yu-fang from the opposition People First Party
urged the country's politicians to spare military personnel the
ordeal of being forced to take sides during campaigning, saying that
the country has been plagued by the problem of politicians trying to
use the military for their own purposes rather than the other way
around.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER PRESIDENT LEE TO HELP IN SOONG EMBEZZLEMENT CASE: LEGISLATOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 22 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui is more than
willing to help investigators look into charges of alleged
embezzlement of party funds by current opposition vice presidential
candidate James Soong between 1989 and 1993, one of Lee's political
follower said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Cheng-lung, caucus whip of the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
at the Legislative Yuan, quoted Lee as saying that the leadership of
a head of state depends much on integrity, and as the leader of the
country and chairman of the Kuomintang (KMT) between 1988 and 2000,
Lee would do his best to defend his honor and is happy to answer
investigators' questions to help them find the truth.</P>
      <P>The TSU is a political party made up of Lee's political
followers.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks hours after Lee was summoned as a witness
to the office of prosecutors at the Taipei District Court to answer
questions about the alleged embezzlement of KMT funds by former party
secretary-general James Soong.</P>
      <P>Lee did not reveal the nature of his testimony, citing a law
which forbids the disclosure of anything related to a case being
investigated by prosecutors.</P>
      <P>The former president, however, has in the past denied that he had
any knowledge about a secret slush fund set up by the KMT that was at
the disposal of its secretary-general.</P>
      <P>Soong is accused of siphoning off NT$360 million (US$10.58
million) from party coffers during his term as KMT secretary-general
between 1989 and 1993.</P>
      <P>The KMT filed a complaint with prosecutors on Feb. 16, 2000
during the run-up to the 2000 presidential election where Soong ran
as an independent against KMT candidate Lien Chan in a three-way race
with Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Soong claimed Lee authorized him to use the funds for political
purposes and offered to return what was left of the money to the
party.</P>
      <P>About one year later, after Lien and Soong had lost to President
Chen of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , prosecutors decided
on Jan. 20, 2001 not to file an indictment against Soong, and the
KMT, led by Lien Chan at that time, decided not to appeal the
decision.</P>
      <P>However, a lawyer for the KMT appealed the prosecutors' ruling on
his own, arguing that new evidence against Soong had come to light
which legally compelled prosecutors to reopen the investigation.</P>
      <P>Lee, who fell out with Soong in 1998 and broke ranks with the KMT
in late 2000 over political differences, has publicly disputed
Soong's explanation of the fund and has offered to give testimony to
prosecutors.</P>
      <P>The KMT later reconciled with Soong and decided to cooperate with
his People First Party (PFP) to field a joint ticket for the 2004
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lee's appearance at the prosecutors' office Wednesday has drawn
partisan reactions from various political parties.</P>
      <P>Soong's PFP discredited the prosecutors' move to summon Lee as
politically motivated and said that the entire affairs is only being
done to try to sully Soong's candidacy for vice president.</P>
      <P>PFP lawmaker Chou Shih-wei said the ruling DPP is expected to
play up the case as the presidential election in March, 2004 draws
near.</P>
      <P>KMT whip at the Legislative Yuan Lee Chia-chin said all the
evidence offered by Lee in his testimony had already been reviewed by
prosecutors before they decided to throw out the complaint in 2001.</P>
      <P>The ruling DPP is interesting in the case only because it can be
used as political ammunition against Soong in the presidential race,
Lee Chia-chin said.</P>
      <P>The ruling party, however, praised the actions of the former
president for his courage in coming forward and answering
prosecutors' questions.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Kao Chih-peng said Soong should subject himself to
judicial investigation and not try to turn a simple judicial case
into a political issue.</P>

Hualien in eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The northern group first visited the Industrial Technology
Research Institute (ITRI) in Hsinchu, where officials told the
visitors that the institute has been a bridge of cooperation between
the industrial and academic sectors over the years and that it has
contributed a great deal to Taiwan's industry.</P>
      <P>They also expressed the hope that the visit will give the
participants a better understanding of Taiwan's industries and the
various cooperation projects with foreign businessmen, adding that
the ITRI has opened up its laboratories and that three or four
foreign businesses have already set up shops there to pursue
technology cooperation.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the scale of the Taiwan market might be
small, but its edge in talent, management and infrastructure cannot
be overlooked, while the ITRI offers a world-class research and
development environment.</P>
      <P>If the ITRI can attract more foreign investors, they went on, it
is expected to upgrade industrial standards through technology
cooperation.</P>
      <P>The group later toured the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park,
Taiwan's technology industry showcase.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the southern group went to the Tainan Science-based
Industrial Park, as well as Kaohsiung Harbor and the Kaohsiung
Economic Processing Zone, all in southern Taiwan.</P>

      <P>A total of 527 Republic of China military

living with them, a senior Ministry of National Defense (MND)
official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Pang-chih, director of the MND's political warfare
department, made the remarks during a meeting of the Legislative
Yuan's Defense Committee.</P>
      <P>At the meeting, Legislator Ho Min-hao of the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union said he wanted to know how many mainland relatives
of local military officers have come to live in Taiwan and how many
of those people have since joined the ROC military or been admitted
to military academies.</P>
      <P>Ho further said he is worried about the possible adverse impact
on Taiwan's national security in view of the fact that some senior
military officers have next of kin from the mainland living with
them.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen said that while 527 military officers have
mainland relatives living with them, none of their mainland next of
kin have joined the military and nor have any of them been admitted
to local military schools.</P>
      <P>Under current regulations, mainland Chinese people cannot join
volunteer military services until they have been naturalized ROC
citizens for at least 20 years.</P>
      <P>Chen further said that all military servicemen are prohibited
from using military telephone lines to get in touch with any
individual persons or units on the mainland. Moreover, the MND has
strict security regulations and any military personnel involved in
disclosing military secrets will be subject to harsh penalties.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun directed law
enforcement authorities Wednesday to spare no efforts in trying to
track down former Kaohsiung City Council Speaker Chu An-hsiung and
bring him to justice.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung District Prosecutor's Office issued an all-points
bulletin for Chu Monday after he failed to turn himself in that day
in accordance with an arrest warrant issued for him last Friday.</P>
      <P>Chu, who is facing a 22-month jail term for vote-buying in the
election for the speakership late last year, failed to report to
court to begin serving his term, prompting the Kaohsiung prosecutors
to issue the APB.</P>
      <P>Chu's whereabouts remained unknown as of noon Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Yu said that Chu's sentence is a decision made by the law
enforcement authorities in accordance with the law and that Chu's
flight tarnishes the image of the government and is a slap in the
face to the credit of the authorities.</P>
      <P>However, Chu's family accused the government in a press
conference Tuesday of imposing "green terror" on Chu, claiming that
it dealt with Chu "selectively" for political purposes.</P>
      <P>Chu's wife, Wu Teh-mei, told the press that she has not been in
contact with Chu and claimed that she did not know his whereabouts.
"If he is abroad, he will seek political asylum," she said.</P>
      <P>Dismissing the family's claims, Yu said that Chu was dealt with
squarely and in accordance with the law in order to fulfill the
public's expectations. "The law enforcement authorities' stance on
Chu will not swerve or be daunted," the premier said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Yin-tang, director-general of the National Police
Administration, said the warrant for Chu's arrest will be posted at
airports, harbors and bus stations, as well as on street posts.</P>
      <P>However, rumors have been circulating that Chu has been seen
recently in a hotel in Zhaihai City, in the southern mainland Chinese
province of Guangdong.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER PRESIDENT ATTENDS HEARING AS WITNESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui attended a
hearing at the Taipei Prosecutor's Office Wednesday as a witness in
the investigations into the Chunghsing Bill Finance Co. scandal.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time in Taiwan's history that a former head
of state has been questioned by law enforcement officers.</P>
      <P>Lee was in good spirits when he left the prosecutor's office
after two and a half hours of talks with two prosecutors.</P>
      <P>Lee refrained from answering press inquiries about the contents
of his talks with the prosecutors, saying he must abide by the law
which prohibits any disclosure of any details of a case that is being
probed.</P>
      <P>The Chunghsing Bill Finance Co. scandal involves People First
Party Chairman James Soong, who has been accused of having embezzled
Kuomintang (KMT) funds during his tenure as the party's
secretary-general in the early 1990s.</P>
      <P>The KMT ruled Taiwan for more than five decades until May 2000.
While Soong served as the KMT's chief manager of day-to-day affairs,
Lee was KMT chairman. Prosecution authorities said they believe that
Lee might be able to provide them with some information that may help
in the investigation.</P>
      <P>Soong used to be Lee's protege, but their relationship soured
after the central government decided to marginalize the Taiwan
Provincial Government during Soong's tenure as the island's
first-ever popularly elected governor. The provincial government was
marginalized in 1998 when Soong's governorship ended. Soong later
defied KMT policy to run in the 2000 presidential election as an
independent. He narrowly lost the election and then shortly
afterwards founded the PFP.</P>
      <P>Soong will serve as incumbent KMT Chairman Lien Chan's running
mate in the 2004 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taipei District Court has also issued a subpoena
to former President Lee requiring that he appear in court Nov. 12 as
a witness in the trial of a former KMT official who has been charged
with involvement in a snowballing land development scandal. This will
also mark a first in Taiwan history -- namely a former president
attending a court hearing as a witness.</P>

      <P>Chen is one of the few experts in the current Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) administration who are versed in mainland
China's grass-roots politics and major political factions. He was a
chief writer of President Chen Shui-bian's white paper on
cross-strait policy during the 2000 presidential campaign.</P>
      <P>Chen's speech on Taiwan's cross-strait policy will be delivered
at a dinner party at the Taiwan Hall Sunday.</P>
      <P>During his stay, Chen will also attend a seminar on the current
state of cross-strait relations as well as Taiwan's plan to hold a
referendum on certain policy issues before or on the day of its next
presidential election in March 2004.</P>
      <P>The seminar will be sponsored by the Chinese Constitutional
Reform Association, founded by Wang Dan, an exiled pro-democracy
mainland Chinese student leader who is now working on a doctoral
degree at Harvard University.</P>
      <P>Wang said cross-strait relations are a critical factor in
mainland China's future political development and constitutional
reform. In his view, he said, Washington-Beijing relations are
crucial to mainland China's modernization and political development.
"And a major barrier to U.S.-mainland China relations is the possible
outbreak of cross-strait conflicts," he added.</P>
      <P>At the upcoming seminar, Chen is expected to expound on the
background and reasoning of DPP administration's decision to hold a
referendum. Several mainland Chinese scholars will present their
views on the DPP's referendum plan.</P>
      <P>Andrew Nathan, chairman of Columbia University's political
science department, will also attend the seminar to offer his own
views and the U.S. academic community's opinions about Taiwan's
referendum proposal.</P>

      <P>Yokohama Mayor Hiroshi Nakada paid a
visit Thursday to the Kaohsiung city government with the aim of
boosting the relationship between the people of the two cities and
the ties between Japan and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that he is the first mayor from Yokohama to visit the
southern Taiwan port city, Nakada said he is deeply impressed by the
city's vigor and progress and added that the Taiwan's largest port
possesses advantages that Yokohama can learn about. He voiced the
hope that the two port cities can transform themselves into
world-class seaports through increased two-way exchanges.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Deputy Mayor Lin Yung-chien gave high praise for
Yokohama's development of its port and the conservation of the city's
cultural heritage. He said many public affairs being promoted by
Yokohama's municipal authorities are worth learning by Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Lin told Nakada that the central government plans to build
Kaohsiung into a free trade port zone and welcomes Japanese
investment. The two men also agreed in principle to the idea of

      <P>Taiwan's industrial production index stood

7.49 percent over the year-earlier level, a Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) official said Thursday.</P>

the official at the MOEA's Statistics Department.</P>
      <P>He noted that the information industry registered the largest
rise of 11.45 percent, and attributed the growth mainly to a rebound
in global demand for consumer electronics, computers and
telecommunication equipment.</P>
      <P>The chemical and metal machinery industries also expanded by 7.25
percent and 3.24 percent year-on-year, respectively, thanks to the
many orders placed with Taiwan companies as a result of an

    <HEADLINE>KINMEN, MATSU PEOPLE TO REPLACE RALLY WITH PUBLIC HEARING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A protest rally by people from Kinmen and
Matsu who reside in Taipei was called off at the last minute Thursday
after the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said that it is preparing to
address their grievances.</P>
      <P>Aides of Legislator Wu Cheng-tian, who was to have sponsored the
rally, said that as the MAC has said it is preparing to address the
grievances "with goodwill, " they decided to suspend the rally and
replace it with a public hearing in the legislature on grievances
over the "mini-three links."</P>
      <P>The aides said that legislators, government officials, scholars
and experts will be invited to take part in the public hearing.</P>
      <P>Both Wu, who comes from Kinmen and Legislator Tsao Yuan-chang from
Matsu, noted that the mini-links -- direct trade, postal and
transportation links between Kinmen and Matsu and designated ports in
mainland China -- were put into practice in January 2000.</P>
      <P>But they said that Kinmen and Matsu people who live in Taiwan
proper do not enjoy the same right as those who register in the two
outlying islands for more than six months and can move freely to and
from the mainland under the mini-links.</P>
      <P>The aides said that they had originally planned to hold the rally
Friday in front of the Legislative Yuan to let Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen know that they had "had enough"
of the MAC.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, MAC officials pointed out that exchanges between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait since the inauguration of the
mini-links have been "seriously imbalanced."</P>
      <P>They noted that as of August this year, Taiwan people had made
more than 78,000 visits to the mainland, while mainland people had
made less than 4,000 visits to Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>The officials said that if the mini-links are to benefit Kinmen
and Matsu economically, it will require matching efforts from the
mainland authorities.</P>
      <P>They added that Kinmen and Matsu people should not just demand
that the government open the doors wider but should also express
strongly to the mainland authorities their desire for matching
measures from the other side of the strait.</P>
      <P>MAC officials recently said that according to media reports and
the council's own investigation, Kinmen and Matsu residents have
purchased between 1,000 and 2,000 houses in Fujian Province just
across the Taiwan Strait, paying an estimated combined total of
between NT$1.5 billion and NT$4 billion (US$44.11 million-US$117.64
million).</P>
      <P>They also said the MAC had originally hoped that Taiwan
cigarettes could be shipped to the mainland via Kinmen and Matsu, but
this has not materialized because the mainland has refused to adopt
matching measures.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan remains well ahead of mainland China
in the development of the semiconductor industry amid burgeoning
competition between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, a prominent
industry leader said Thursday.</P>
      <P>United Microelectronics Corp. Chairman Robert Tsao made the
comment while answering questions from the press following a news
conference in which the Fabless Semiconductor Association (FSA)
announced its decision to set up an Asia-Pacific operations hub in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan leads mainland China in the semiconductor
industry despite the fact that some mainland-based IC design
companies are emerging, Tsao said that Taiwan is still the backbone
in development, on the grounds that Taiwan still attracts major
investment plans from around the world.</P>
      <P>Although many people believe that the mainland is quickly
catching up with Taiwan, Tsao said that "Taiwan is still running
ahead of the mainland" because "the mainland market is still small
and possesses no special advantages for foreign investors."</P>
      <P>However, the industry leader also pointed out that it is totally
wrong and goes completely against world trends for a country to stay
in reclusion. A country must not set limits on itself in the pursuit
of globalization, he added.</P>
      <P>Echoing Tsao's view, FSA Chief Executive Officer Jodi Shelton
agreed that Taiwan remains much more competitive than the mainland
because of its efforts in research and development, as well as its
drive in innovation and design.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taichung,  Oct.  23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The nation's top planner of mainland
China policy predicted Thursday that Beijing will deal with
Taiwan more pragmatically after next year's presidential election and
that the long-stalled cross-strait talks will also be resumed.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen made the
predictions in a speech delivered at the 16th joint conference of the
Republic of China-New Zealand and New Zealand-Taiwan Business
Councils, which took place in Taichung, central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, Taiwan's economic situation will become
clearer after the March 20, 2004 presidential election and the
Beijing authorities are "bound" to take a more pragmatic stance on
relations with Taiwan. This, she claimed will make possible a
re-opening of cross-strait dialogue, which she said will allow
cross-strait direct shipping links and the adjustment of related
trade policies move forward smoothly.</P>
      <P>Addressing concern over the direction of Taiwan's long-term
economic development, she said that the government is dealing with
the issue of direct cross-strait shipping links. In the
transitional period before dialogue resumes, the government will
promote preparations and assessments for direct links, as well as
faster and more convenient cargo transportation measures, so as to
create more favorable conditions for direct links.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that through an objective assessment, "we have realized
that bringing the greatest benefit to Taiwan's economy and cutting
the negative impact of direct cross-strait links to the minimum will
hinge on several factors."</P>
      <P>These factors, she went on, include "whether Taiwan can upgrade
its globalization, whether it can improve its overall investment
environment and living quality to attract more foreign investment,
whether it can maintain the competitiveness of its core industries
and whether it can promote a balanced flow of resources between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait."</P>
      <P>Asked about mainland China's development of close economic
partner arrangements with Hong Kong and Macao, Tsai said that Beijing
is not interested in resuming normal talks with Taiwan and that any
arrangements similar to the Hong Kong or Macau models would only be
"empty talk" by Beijing.</P>
      <P>She claimed that Taiwan should not be rushed in the negotiations
over direct cross-strait shipping links, or it will risk losing its
bargaining chips.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, cross-strait relations are a major part of
international relations that have deep and far-reaching influence on
the Asia-Pacific regional and world development. Cross-strait trade
development will have to be reviewed under the framework of
Asia-Pacific development and the world economy, she added.</P>
      <P>In dealing with cross-strait issues, she went on, the paramount
consideration will be how to deal with the challenge of globalization
and the development of regional economic integration.</P>
      <P>She noted that the government is now establishing its "roots in
Taiwan, access the world" policy and said Taiwan has to strengthen
the foundation of its economy for global competitiveness and turn
cross-strait trade into an impetus that will stimulate, not hinder,
Taiwan's economic development.</P>
      <P>More than 150 participants took part in the conference, including
New Zealand-Taiwan Business Council President Bertha Wright, Peter
Dunne, chairman of the Foreign Affairs, Defense and Trade Committee
of New Zealand's Parliament, and the host, Taichung Mayor Jason Hu.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan must be prudent and cautious despite
an economic recovery that is taking shape in the face of various
uncertain factors, such as a reappearance of severe acute respiratory
syndrome, Vice Premier Lin Hsin-i said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks while giving a keynote speech at a
three-day Taiwan-United States seminar on technological exchanges,
which opened the same day.</P>
      <P>Although a set of prime economic indicators shows that the
domestic economy is moderately regaining momentum, Lin said Taiwan
must remain alert for the negative impact of a possible reemergence
of the potentially deadly disease this winter.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics has set Taiwan's economic growth rate for 2003 at 3.06
percent, which he said is lower than the forecast by many other
research institutions.</P>
      <P>Compared to mainland China, Taiwan remains very competitive in
various critical fields, the vice premier claimed. He said Taiwan is
stronger in research and development (R&amp;D) , international
cooperation, overseas investment and location.</P>
      <P>As of Oct. 21, world-class multinationals, including IBM, Intel,
Sony, HP and Software, had set up 15 R&amp;D centers in Taiwan, and eight
top foreign companies had opened distribution centers, he noted,

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., Compal, ACM and Delta
Electronics also had opened 61 R&amp;D hubs at home.</P>
      <P>Stressing that wages are not the decisive element for a country

      <P>At a time when many countries have left Taiwan behind in terms of
production costs, he urged local businesses to dedicate their energy
to technology- and capital-intensive industries and spare no effort
to promote their brand names and engage in distribution.</P>
      <P>In a bid to call for greater efforts from the private sector on
creation and innovation, he said the government will increase its
spending in R&amp;D to account for 3 percent of Taiwan's gross domestic
product (GDP) by 2007.</P>
      <P>According to the vice premier, Taiwan spends about US$11 billion
per year in R&amp;D, accounting for some 2.16 percent of its GDP, lower
than Japan's 2.98 percent, the U.S.' 2.7 percent and South Korea's

    <HEADLINE>VICE PRESIDENT LIGHTS REFERENDUM TORCH AT SOUTHERN TIP OF TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu lighted a
"referendum torch" at the southern tip of Taiwan Thursday to drum up
support for a large rally scheduled for Saturday in Kaohsiung,
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lu ignited the torch in front of the Oluanpi Lighthouse in
Pingtung County, and later ran with 16 legislators for a kilometer
before passing it to a torch relay team to continue the journey to
Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Delivering a speech before the run, the vice president said,
"Although Taiwan has been moving toward democracy for quite some
time, it has yet to promote a referendum."</P>
      <P>She said that neighboring countries such as Japan, the
Philippines, and South Korea have all conducted referendums, and
holding a referendum is fairly common in the United States, adding
that the Republic of China Constitution has endowed its people with
the rights of election, recall, initiative and referendum and that
when the people are not satisfied with the government's policy or the
legislation passed by the Legislative Yuan, they can exercise their
rights.</P>
      <P>She expressed the hope that the Legislative Yuan will pass
referendum legislation this session, adding that it is the obligation
of legislators to pass the referendum legislation and that all voters
should ask the legislators to do their duty.</P>
      <P>The torch-lighting ceremony was presided over by Legislator Trong
Chai of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, who serves as the
convener of an alliance to push for referendum legislation with 16
other legislators, including Lo Chih-ming of the Taiwan Solidarity
Union, Cheng Chao-ming, Chiu Chui-tseng and others from the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party also attending.</P>
      <P>The Oct. 25 rally is expected to mobilize more than 200,000
people to take to the streets, officials of an alliance to push for a
referendum said.</P>
      <P>The officials said that Kaohsiung is the birthplace of Taiwan's
democracy movement and the referendum rally aims to awaken the
consciousness of Taiwan people to display their support for
"Taiwanization, democracy and progress."</P>
      <P>The vice president headed the "southern leg" of the three-day,
157km run from Oluanpi, while the "northern leg, " which was led by
former DPP Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung at the site of the partially
completed Fourth Nuclear Power Plant, will meet up on Saturday
evening with President Chen Shui-bian shooting a "referendum arrow"
toward the metaphorical target of "a referendum for a new
constitution" to bring the event to a climax.</P>
      <P>The "northern leg" running team began its 492.3km run Sunday from
Taipei County to the southern port city of Kaohsiung, crossing
through Keelung City, Taipei City, Taoyuan County, Hsinchu County and
Miaoli County in the north, down to Taichung County, Taichung City
and Nantou, Changhua and Yunlin counties in central Taiwan, and
Chiayi County, Chiayi City, Tainan County and Kaohsiung County in the

    <HEADLINE>MOFA TO ADDRESS DESIGNATION ISSUE TO MAINTAIN NATIONAL DIGNITY: KAU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will
propose suitable designations for the Republic of China to facilitate
its presence in the international arena and satisfy local people's
expectations, a senior official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Michael Ying Mao Kau made the
remarks while delivering a report on the issues of the nation's
designation and foreign affairs to the Legislative Yuan's Foreign and
Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee.</P>
      <P>In the face of the campaign to "rectify the name of Taiwan" and
the nation's increasingly difficult diplomatic situation, Kau said
MOFA will address the designation issue by "complying with existing
statutes and epitomizing Taiwan's sovereign status."</P>
      <P>Kau said the drive to "rectify the name of Taiwan," also known as
the "Call Taiwan, Taiwan" movement, arises from three major
background factors -- mainland China's intensified suppression and
all-out diplomatic embargo against the ROC; the necessity to upgrade
Taiwan's global presence amid the prevailing globalization wave; and
the keen desire of local people to enhance Taiwan's international
profile.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Kau said the MOFA must work out suitable
options for the nation's designation to distinguish the ROC from the
People's Republic of China (PRC) -- mainland China's official title
-- while keeping the nation's dignity.</P>
      <P>"We must resolve the designation issue under the present
constitutional framework and the principles of democracy and rule of
law so that domestic political parties and non-governmental
organizations (NGO) can attend major international activities.</P>
      <P>Kau said the MOFA has different options for the nation's
designation in engagements with the ROC's diplomatic allies and with
countries that do not recognize the ROC diplomatically, for
membership in international organizations and for applying for a seat
in the United Nations.</P>
      <P>"While engaging our 26 diplomatic allies, we use our official
title of the Republic of China. In some cases, we would advise our
allies to call us the 'R.O.C.' or 'Taiwan' to distinguish us from
from the PRC, which is commonly known as 'China' in the international
community," Kau said.</P>
      <P>As the ROC's designation in international governmental
organizations (IGOs) or NGOs has often been affected by mainland
China's political interference, Kau said MOFA has worked out a
priority list for use in membership applications -- the ROC, Taiwan,
Taiwan, R.O.C., and R.O.C. (Taiwan), in that order.</P>
      <P>Besides, he said, the ROC's designation in the World Trade
Organization (WTO) -- the Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan,
Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu -- may also be used under certain special
circumstances.</P>
      <P>While engaging with countries that do not maintain diplomatic
ties with the ROC, Kau said Taiwan cannot unilaterally change the
designation of its representative offices in those countries. "We
must be pragmatic and consult with the countries of residence."</P>
      <P>As to Taiwan's U.N. bid, Kau said, it's a highly sensitive
political issue. "Changing our national title alone cannot ensure our
entry to that world body. We must take international political
reality into account," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POTABLE WATER ON OUTLYING ISLAND TO IMPROVE WITH NEW PIPELINE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday the
development of small islands off Taiwan proper is important to his
administration and that is why a second undersea fresh water pipeline
will be constructed to better supply Liuchiu township.</P>
      <P>The outlying islet called Hsiaoliuchiu (Little Liuchiu) , off
southern Taiwan's Pingtung County, is currently supplied with only
one water pipeline from Taiwan proper. The new pipeline could begin
construction as early as next year, the president said.</P>
      <P>President Chen noted that the first undersea water pipeline
between Pingtung County and Liuchiu township is 30-year-old, and
whenever it requires annual repair and maintenance the residents
suffer much inconvenience.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while presiding over the inaugural
journey of the second government-run ferry at Tafu fishing port in
Liuchiu township. The president, accompanied by Pingtung Magistrate
Su Chia-chuan, earlier took the ferry at Tungkang Pier, Pingtung
County, to Liuchiu township.</P>
      <P>The president said that when he visited Liuchiu township three
years ago, he learned that people there needed another government-run
ferry to ply the township and Pingtung County. He said that after the
persistent efforts of the central and local governments, the
appropriation of more than NT$80 million (US$2.35 million) and over
seven months of construction, he was happy to be able to have
delivered on his promise to the local people.</P>
      <P>"The government attaches great importance to the transportation
infrastructure of Taiwan's outlying islands, " the president said,
adding that he has instructed the Executive Yuan to plan construction
projects for outlying islands between 2003 and 2006, and that the
improvement of the supply of potable water in Liuchiu township and
the development of local tourism are part of that project.</P>
      <P>He also said that a project to develop a sea park at Hsiaoliuchiu
is proceeding smoothly, and that he hopes that local fishermen can
upgrade the value of fishery products with the guidance and
assistance of the government to better fishermen's lives.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HI-TECH SECTOR KEEN ON NATIONAL DEFENSE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  24 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The private high-tech sector is keen on
gaining business opportunities from national defense industries, as a
total of 122 companies are taking part in the 2003 National Defense
Research Show at the Taipei World Trade Center, a spokesman for the
Taipei Computer Association said Friday.</P>
      <P>Tu Chuan-chang, secretary-general of the association in charge of
organizing the event for the Ministry of National Defense, said many
top domestic hi-tech groups, such as Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Corp., the Acer Group, Via Technologies and Asustek
Computer, are vying for a slice of the big pie, particularly in the
field of C4ISR capabilities -- combat telecommunications, computer,
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.</P>
      <P>As many Taiwan-based companies are able to supply key parts and
components and software of the ministry's planned procurement of
C4ISR systems and early monitoring systems, the ministry is willing
to purchase from qualified domestic companies to help beef up
Taiwan's national defense industry and also to reduce costs, Tu said.</P>
      <P>In a bid to seize business opportunities from the military,
companies are displaying their products and facilities made with
biotechnology and nanotechnology at the show, he noted, adding that
the ministry has long been hoping to incorporate the most advanced
technology from the private sector to help it strengthen
information-related combat capabilities for the armed forces.</P>
      <P>Minister without Portfolio Tsai Ching-yen and Vice Minister of
National Defense Chen Chao-min visited the show, which opened earlier
in the day and will run through next Monday. Innovation, research and
development, as well as science and technology and defense are the
leading themes of the show.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the show is a concrete result of the
coordination of hi-tech reservists recruited by the ministry in
concert with private companies.</P>
      <P>Since the inception of the reservist system in 1980, the ministry
has trained more than 10,000 individuals in hi-tech for the private
sector by allowing conscripts to do four-year military services at
contracted private companies, Chen noted, adding that such a
cooperation platform has largely helped upgrade Taiwan's national
defense industry and also sharpened the private sector's
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Taipei Computer Association Chairman Hung Chung-jen said many
hi-tech company executives have told him that the ministry's
reservist system has become the cradle of high-quality manpower for
them.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLINTON POSTPONES HIS VISIT TO TAIWAN UNTIL NEXT SPRING</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former United States President Bill Clinton
has decided to postpone his scheduled visit to Taiwan in mid-November
to next spring, an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Victor Chin, director-general of the MOFA's North American
Affairs Department, said that Clinton decided to postpone his visit
to Taiwan due to the tight schedule of his upcoming tour of Asia,
which will also take him to Japan and South Korea.</P>
      <P>Clinton was scheduled to visit Taiwan Nov. 15 for a stay of less
than 24 hours, according to an itinerary coordinated between
Clinton's office and his office commissioned by the Democracy
Foundation of Taiwan, which is to sponsor the former U.S. president's
speech and visit to the island, Chin said.</P>
      <P>Clinton originally planned to visit Taiwan in early November and
decided to set a later date for the visit due to President Chen
Shui-bian's planned visit to Panama around the same time, Chin
explained.</P>
      <P>Clinton hopes to stay in Taiwan longer to meet his "old friends"
and to take a more extensive look at the island during his upcoming
visit, he said.</P>
      <P>Clinton visited Taiwan four times during his tenure as governor
of Arkansas before being elected the U.S. president in November, 1991
for his first four-year term that started in 1992.</P>
      <P>He was also scheduled to visit Taiwan on Sept. 12, 2001 and
failed to make it due to the 911 terrorist attacks on the United
States.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT RECEIVES VISITING YOKOHAMA MAYOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 24 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian welcomed visiting
Yokohama Mayor Hiroshi Nakada and members of his city council
delegation Friday at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Chen said he appreciated Nakada's visit to Taiwan as it
represents his support for and goodwill toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president told his guest that he visited Yokohama several
years ago when he served as Taipei mayor. However, he went on, the
then-Yokohama mayor dared only to meet him behind closed doors at a
reception hall located on the coastal area of the port city for fear
of irritating Beijing because Yokohama has sister-city ties with
Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Chen noted that his meeting with Nakada at the
Presidential Office and the latter's visit to Taiwan hold special
significance. The president said that he hopes to visit Yokohama
again in the future. Chen served as Taipei mayor from 1994 to 1998.</P>
      <P>Chen also thanked Nakada for supporting former President Lee
Teng-hui's request to travel to Japan for medical treatment two years

      <P>In response, Nakada praised Chen for his contribution to Taiwan's
democratization and said that he believed the democracy in Taiwan

      <P>Nakada arrived in Taiwan Thursday at the head of a delegation of

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reiterated Friday
the government's relentless efforts to modernize Taiwan and court
foreign investment.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while giving a speech at a ceremony
welcoming companies moving into the second compound of the Nankang
Software Industrial Park in Taipei. Vice President Annette Lu and
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou were also present.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan must promote knowledge-based and clean
industries, Chen noted that the park, set up to house mainly IC
design, digital content and biotechnology businesses, is the
brainchild of such a mindset.</P>
      <P>As long as the government offers a sound investment climate and
modern infrastructure, both foreign and domestic enterprises will be
willing to invest in Taiwan, he said, pointing to the recent
completion of various major investment projects, such as a key tunnel
of the Beiyi Expressway connecting Taipei and Ilan, and the success
of the 2003 Taiwan Business Alliance Conference.</P>
      <P>In the face of the huge challenges ahead, including the emergence
of mainland China's economy as a global force, Chen said Taiwan must
upgrade its industries and improve infrastructure to maintain its
competitive edge.</P>
      <P>For the time being, 94 foreign and domestic companies have
applied to open shop in the second compound of the Nankang software
park, including world-class groups such as IBM, Advanced Micro
Devices (AMD), Infineon, Sony and NEC, occupying more than 90 percent
of the space for rent.</P>
      <P>Initial production value of the park has been estimated at
NT$108.3 billion (US$3.19 billion).</P>
      <P>In addition, the Industrial Technology Research Institute,
Academia Sinica, a semiconductor research institute, a digital
content institution and various incubator centers will also move into
the park.</P>
      <P>The 4.2-hectare compound, a partial realization of the
government's flagship "two trillion, two star" program designed to
advocate Taiwan's most promising hi-tech industries, is a joint
venture between the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the private
sector.</P>
      <P>The "two trillion" industries refer to the semiconductor industry
and the display industry, which are predicted to register each an
annual production output of more than NT$1 trillion by 2006.</P>
      <P>The "two-star" industries are the digital content and the
biotechnology industries, which have been seen as Taiwan's most
potential star industries.</P>
      <P>Production value forecast for the digital industry (including
software, computer games, electronic media, publishing, music,
animation, Internet services, etc.) is set at NT$370 billion in 2006,
while business volume of the biotechnology industry will hit NT$250
billion for the same year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO CHECK 50 TONS OF FISHERY PRODUCTS CLOSELY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The departments of health and agriculture
said Friday that they want to check more closely 50 tons of fishery
products that are ready to be shipped to the European Union.</P>
      <P>The 50 tons of fishery products, including processed eels,
catfish and tilapia belong to five fishery product processing
companies and originated from aquaculture farms in Tainan and
Pingtung in southern Taiwan, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Officials are now traveling to southern Taiwan to examine the
fishery products that are being stored in freezers at the farms. The
results of the testing will be released in two or three days.</P>
      <P>They said that if the aquaculture farm operators are found to
have been using banned chemicals, they will be fined between NT$6,000
and NT$30,000 (US$176 and US$880) and if they have added banned
substances to fish feed, they will be fined between NT$3,000 and
NT$10,000.</P>
      <P>Hu Shin-hwa, director of the Council of Agriculture's Fisheries
Administration, and Department of Health (DOH) officials made the
remarks during a news conference.</P>
      <P>The latest incident came after the EU's recent rejection of 30
tons of Taiwan fishery products exported between August and October,
for allegedly containing carcinogens such as chloramphenicol and
chemical residue such as furajolidone.</P>
      <P>The 30 tons of fishes and shrimps were exported from processing
companies in Kaohsiung and had originally come from the counties of
Kaohsiung, Chiayi, Pingtung and Tainan.</P>
      <P>The reports have sparked an almost islandwide check of seafood
for contamination.</P>
      <P>Government officials said that they might consider buying more
sophisticated equipment to test for chemicals more accurately.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kaohsiung fishery product processors appealed for the
government Friday to vigorously monitor the feed used by aquaculture
farms.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung is the stronghold of Taiwan fishery products, with more
than 100 large operators. As the competition is steep, many
processors are worried that news report about Taiwan's exported
fishes containing banned chemicals might have an adverse impact on
the exports of Taiwan fishery products in general.</P>

not think that the push for a new constitution is aimed at promoting
Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party

1,071 effective samples with a margin of error of 3 percent.</P>
      <P>The results show that 66.1 percent favor the idea that any change
of Taiwan's status quo must be decided by referendum, while 64.2
percent said that only major policies should have to be decided by
referendum.</P>

World Health Organization.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 67.2 percent of those polled do not

      <P>The overseas supporters of presidential

statement Thursday to show their support for Lien's election
campaign.</P>
      <P>The statement, issued when leaders of the Overseas Association of

support his position on cross-Taiwan Strait relations, as indicated
in his speech delivered earlier this week in Washington.</P>
      <P>Lien said in the speech that both Taiwan and mainland China
should not lose sight of the more distant future but should instead
set aside their dispute over sovereignty and improve their relations
on the basis of equality, mutual assistance and mutual benefit.</P>
      <P>The statement also said that they support Lien's policy of
"giving first priority to the interests of Taiwan, maintaining the
status quo in cross-strait relations, revitalizing the economy and
promoting trade."</P>
      <P>The statement said that the Republic of China is a sovereign
country and not part of the People's Republic of China. It is
therefore not necessary for the country to proclaim independence or
to hold a national referendum on its identity. In addition, the
statement said that the ROC has a legitimate right to join in world
organizations and that the mainland should not threaten Taiwan with
military force.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A proposal that Taiwan-held Kinmen and
Matsu islands exchange offices with mainland China to bolster two-way
ties is not an issue related to the so-called mini-three links,
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Johnnason Liu said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks in response to a request by residents of the
two islands that the MAC, Taiwan's top mainland policy-planning
agency, further open the mini-links -- direct trade and transport and
postal services that have been in place between Kinmen and Matsu and
the Fujian Province ports of Xiamen and Fuzhou on the mainland since
Jan. 1, 2001.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, the links issue forms a segment of the
government's overall policy toward the mainland and also has an
impact on the whole country.</P>
      <P>Residents of Kinmen and Matsu demanded a day earlier that the
central government further enhance the links to help with the
economic development of the islands in the face of an extreme
imbalance in exchanges between the two sides.</P>
      <P>According to MAC statistics, mainland-bound Taiwan travelers had
made a total of more than 78,000 trips as of the end of August via
the links, while Taiwan-bound mainland people only made a little more
than 3,000 trips.</P>
      <P>An MAC official blamed the mainland authorities for the
situation, on the grounds that full cooperation from the mainland is
indispensable if the links are to proceed smoothly and progressively
so as to benefit both sides.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Officials from Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) said Friday that they had heard not a word from the
mainland Chinese authorities about the alleged arrest of Taiwan
citizen Lin Hsiao-kai, who has been missing since Oct. 7 when he was
last heard from in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Officials from Shanghai's Taiwan Affairs Office confirmed Friday
that Lin has been detained and that he is under interrogation for
taking part in Falun Gong activities in mainland China.</P>
      <P>SEF officials told the CNA that they wrote to the SEF's mainland
counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS), several days ago to inquire about Lin's whereabouts, but had
yet to receive any response.</P>
      <P>The officials said they will continue to contact ARATS for
further information about Lin.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are semi-official organizations set up by
Taiwan and the mainland, respectively, to handle cross-strait affairs
in the absence of formal ties between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Lin, 29, formerly an assistant researcher with the Coastal
Hydraulics Research Center of National Cheng Kung University, went to
Shanghai to visit friends on a tourist visa in September. He sent a
message to his wife in Taiwan Oct. 7 via cell phone saying that he
would be home that night. However, he did not return and has not been
heard of since.</P>
      <P>Lin's wife, Chen Shu-ya, called a press conference in Taipei Oct.
21 to make known her husband's plight and to call for help in finding
him.</P>
      <P>Chen said she believes Lin was arrested because his notebook
computer contained information on Falun Gong, which has been branded
a dangerous cult by the mainland regime.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 24 (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Madame Chiang Kai-shek, considered by many
to be one of the most outstanding Chinese women of the 20th century,
passed away at 11:17 p.m. Thursday at her New York home at the age of
106.</P>
      <P>Andrew Hsia, director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office
in New York, cited Chiang's friends and relatives as saying that the
former first lady passed away peacefully in her sleep.</P>
      <P>Chiang's niece, Kung Lin-yi and her husband were at her bedside
when she died, according to friends.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu expressed
their condolences and Chen instructed Hsia and Republic of China
Representative to the United States Chen Chien-jen to extend his
condolences to the Chiang family on behalf of himself and the
government.</P>
      <P>President Chen instructed Presidential Secretary-General Chiou
I-jen to coordinate the relevant agencies to provide assistance
pertaining to the funeral and other arrangements.</P>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene Chien also expressed his
condolences and praised Chiang for her stature in the diplomatic
arena, as well as her contributions to the ROC.</P>
      <P>Chiang, the widow of the late Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, had
spent most of the 28 years since her husband's death in 1975 in
seclusion in New York.</P>
      <P>Chiang, whose maiden name was Soong Mayling, was born in March
1897 in Shanghai. She went to the United States in 1908 and entered
Wellesley College in 1913, where she majored in English literature
and minored in philosophy.</P>
      <P>After her graduation from Wellesley in 1917, she returned to
China, where she honed her fluency in spoken Chinese and studied the
classics and literature of China. There she met her husband in 1920.</P>
      <P>Chiang's life was inextricably linked to the history of modern
China and Taiwan. With her western-education and impeccable English,
she became the best spokeswoman for the Chinese cause against the
invading Japanese Imperial Army in the 1930s.</P>
      <P>She and her husband together faced the military crackdown on the
warlords of northern China, the crusade against communist rebellion,
the eight-year war against Japanese aggression and the struggle
against the Chinese communists, with the ultimate goal of reclaiming
mainland China.</P>
      <P>After the Chinese communists took control of the mainland in
1949, the ROC first couple retreated to Taiwan and became Asia's
foremost symbol of anti-communism. Generalissimo Chiang served as ROC
president and KMT chairman until his death in Taipei in 1975.</P>
      <P>The former first lady made a rare public appearance in mid-1995
when she attended a reception at Capitol Hill in her honor in
connection with celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary of the end
of World War II.</P>

      <P>The European Parliament on Thursday
reiterated the European Union's "insistence" that the cross-Taiwan
Strait problems be solved in a peaceful manner.</P>
      <P>The European Parliament passed a general annual report on the
common diplomacy and security policies of all E.U. member countries,
reiterating that the European Union "insists" with "strong interest"
that both sides of the Taiwan Strait seek to solve the Taiwan issue
through dialogue.</P>
      <P>The report also called for mainland China to remove all the
missiles it has deployed in its coastal provinces opposite Taiwan so
as to help maintain peace and security in the Taiwan Strait.</P>

to build closer ties with Taiwan under multilateral frameworks and to
support Taiwan's efforts to join international organizations.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Clear and unequivocal position statement
is helpful to maintain stability in the Taiwan Strait, President Chen
Shui-bian's chief of staff said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chiou I-jen, secretary-general to the president, made the remarks
in a speech delivered at a meeting of the Taiwan chapter of the
Rotary International. The meeting was held as part of the group's
support of President Chen's re-election bid.</P>
      <P>Chiou said there are two dimensions in cross-strait relations,
namely basic stances and actual policies.</P>
      <P>As far as the basic stances are concerned, Chiou said, both sides
of the Taiwan Strait are firm on their positions.</P>
      <P>"Chen's administration has stick to its 'one state on each side'
of the Taiwan Strait stance, while Beijing's cardinal position is its
cherished 'one China' principle," Chiou explained.</P>
      <P>While neither side has shown signs of compromise or retreat from
their stances over the past three-plus years, Chiou said,
cross-strait have actually made progress.</P>
      <P>In his view, Chiou said, Beijing leaders are far more pragmatic
and smarter than local opposition politicians have thought.</P>
      <P>Since the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration was
inaugurated in May 2000, he said, the two sides have completed
Hong Kong and Macau aviation rights negotiations. Moreover, Chiou
said, Taiwan now can repatriate about 2,000 illegal mainland Chinese
immigrants annually. "All these issue couldn't have been resolved
if the two sides had not have contacts," he added.</P>
      <P>Over the past three-plus years, Chiou continued, the DPP
administration has adopted a total of 18 measures to facilitate
cross-strait exchanges in various fields, or one measure for every
two to three months.</P>
      <P>"The figures indicate that we have moved toward
normalization of cross-strait ties in a gradual and prudent manner,"
Chiou explained.</P>
      <P>With Beijing-Washington and Beijing-Tokyo relations improving,
Chiou said, Taiwan faces even greater diplomatic challenges. Worse
still, he said, mainland China has continued stepping up military
buildup.</P>
      <P>"In the face of all these new developments, we must redouble
efforts to beef up our national strength and survive in the highly
competitive international market," he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>About 9 percent of Taiwan people aged over
15 are feeling the blues, according to the results of a survey
released by the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) Saturday.</P>
      <P>The DOH conducted the survey last year. It interviewed 32,660
randomly chosen residents aged 15 or over and collected 26,755 valid
replies. Senior high school graduates, married people and those aged
between 45 and 64 formed the bulk of the respondents.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 8.9 percent of the respondents felt the
blues during the month before the interview. The percentage was far
higher than the world average of 3 percent estimated by the World
Health Organization.</P>
      <P>The figure also indicated that about one million local people
showed symptoms of depression. Worse still, 5.2 percent of them were
patients of serious depression and the number of women in this group
was 1.8 times that of men. The DOH estimated that only 2.3 percent of
those patients have received professional medical treatment.</P>
      <P>While 8.4 percent of elderly people (aged 65 or over) interviewed
said they felt the blues, 6.8 percent of those aged between 15 and 17
also said they suffered from depression.</P>
      <P>Health was the elderly people's main cause of depression while
uncertainty about the future was the largest source of the blues
among young people.</P>
      <P>With the jobless rate rising, career prospects have become the
biggest source of depression for those aged between 25 and 44.
Most male patients attributed their blues mainly to unemployment
or economic factor while many female respondents cited
parents-children relations as the main cause of the blues.</P>
      <P>The DOH survey also found many male depression patients were aged
between 25 and 44, divorced, lived in metorpolitan areas, grew up
in familes with parents from mainland China, had low income and
suffered from chronic diseases.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, women who said they often felt the blues
concentrated in two age groups of 15-24 and 25-44. Many of these
women had only received elementary or high school education, were
divorced or widowed, and suffered from chronic diseases.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will adhere to European
Union (E.U.) standards in inspecting for chemical residues in
aquaculture products, a senior official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Hu Shin-hwa, director of the Council of Agriculture's (COA's)
Fisheries Administration, made the remarks while briefing local
aquaculture farm operators on the country's new fishery products
inspection rules.</P>
      <P>Hu traveled to National Pingtung University of Science and
Technology in southern Taiwan to give the briefing after the E.U.'s
recent rejection of 30 tons of Taiwan fishery products exported
between August and October for allegedly containing possible
carcinogens such as chloramphenicol and furazolidone, which are used
in the treatment of infections caused by bacteria.</P>
      <P>Hu told aquaculture farm operators and seafood processors that the
European Union has raised chemical residue standards. "This is a
general world trend. We must follow this trend to maintain our market
niche and business reputation," he added.</P>
      <P>In the past, the maximum chloramphenicol and furazolidone residue
was set at 0.3 parts per billion. "In the future, we'll comply with
the E.U. standard of no more than 0.1 parts per billion," Hu said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he said, the number of cases to be subject to spot
checks as well as the frequency of inspection wills all be
substantially raised.</P>
      <P>The stricter residue standard will increase the cost to NT$5,000
per inspection from the current NT$2,000, Hu said, adding that the
COA will also invest an additional NT$50 million in acquiring new
inspection equipment.</P>
      <P>According to Hu, inspectors from fishery and health departments
are visiting major aquaculture farms around the island to check
whether banned chemicals are being used.</P>
      <P>"Operators who are found to have been using banned chemicals will
be fined between NT$6,000 and NT$30,000 (US$176 and US$880) , " Hu
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan produces some 350,000 tons of aquaculture products a year,

    <HEADLINE>TWO XINHUA NEWS AGENCY REPORTERS COVER REFERENDUM RALLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Oct.  25 (CNA)
(By Soifa Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two reporters from mainland China's
official Xinhua News Agency have traveled to the southern Taiwan port
city of Kaohsiung to cover a large-scale rally to promote referendum
legislation and formulation of a new constitution for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Zhang Yung, a reporter from Xinhua's Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau
affairs department, and Wu Zengxiang, a photo-journalist from
Xinhua's Shandong bureau, arrived in Kaohsiung Wednesday to cover the
referendum rally which started at 2 p.m. Saturday and will last
through 10 p.m.</P>
      <P>Zhang said he has covered major Taiwan news events in the past
few years and is pleased to cover the referendum rally, the largest
of its kind ever held in Taiwan. More than 200,000 are expected to
take part.</P>
      <P>Both Zhang and Wu said they believe that the referendum rally is
just a campaign strategy adopted by the pro-independence "pan-green
camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its ally
the Taiwan Solidarity Union in the run-up to Taiwan's 2004
presidential election.</P>
      <P>They said mainland Chinese authorities have kept a low profile
toward the DPP administration's plan to hold a referendum on certain
public issues either before or on the election day of the island's
next presidential election even though the opposition-controlled
Legislative Yuan has yet to pass a referendum bill. "Beijing will
respect the choice of the people of Taiwan," Zhang said.</P>
      <P>Zhang further said he himself is more concerned about Taiwan
people's views on the establishment of direct cross-Taiwan Strait
transportation links.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SECURITY GUARDS GETTING TOO FRIENDLY WITH MAIDS A PROBLEM IN SINGAPORE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct. 25 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A new code of ethics is being drawn up
for security guards across Singapore. Among the no-no's -- security
guards at condominiums will be discouraged from getting "friendly"
with maids.</P>
      <P>The move is a joint effort by the Association of Certified
Security Agencies and the Security Association of Singapore.</P>
      <P>A code of ethics is expected to be drawn up and implemented next
month.</P>
      <P>Many residents are worried that small talk between maids and
security guards may lead to big problems.</P>
      <P>Ratan Singh, who heads the Industry Capability Upgrading
Programme to raise standards in the local security industry, says
some security agencies have received complaints from condo residents
about this ongoing issue.</P>
      <P>"There have been complaints from tenants about maids talking to
guards while washing cars in the morning so we are trying to get them
to refrain from doing all this. It projects a bad image, " he said.
"They could check on certain things and make themselves more
productive rather than chit-chat and laugh away the time.</P>
      <P>"There was one situation in one of the condos some time ago when
one of the maids was very friendly with all the security personnel
there and then she invited her boyfriend to come because her employer
was away for one month, " said S.T. Moorthy of King's Security and
Safety Management.</P>
      <P>"Just to oblige her, they let him in. And he has been sleeping
there all the while and later it was reported to police that many
items were missing from the house.</P>
      <P>"Security guards are not supposed to fraternize with any female
or male because once you fraternize, you cannot check them. That is a
security risk. So, if anybody gets involved with a maid, we transfer
the guy out," said Moorthy.</P>
      <P>But residents have mixed views, especially since the problem,
they say, only involves a few bad apples.</P>
      <P>"Being friendly is no problem but the most important thing is the
security guard has to draw the line," one person said.</P>
      <P>"It does affect their work. Management changed some of the
security that had this hanky-panky going around. But sometimes you
cannot stop them; they are very friendly. You know they have to
patrol around," another said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. NAVY TEAM ARRIVES TO REPORT SUBMARINE PROCUREMENT PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A U.S. Navy group arrived in Taipei Sunday
on a mission of giving a report to Taiwan officials on the progress
of a submarine procurement project.</P>
      <P>The 10-member U.S. team, headed by Gibson Leboeuf, deputy chief
of the U.S. Navy International Program Department, will be meeting
with officials from the ROC Navy General Headquarters to brief them
on the progress of the plan on Taiwan's procurement of eight diesel
submarines from the United States.</P>
      <P>The U.S. government announced in 2001 a robust package of arms it
had agreed to sell to Taiwan, including the eight diesel-powered
submarines.</P>
      <P>Taiwan formally filed a request in 1995 for procurement of the
submarines from the United States in an effort to beef up its
deterrence capabilities against possible attempts by mainland China
to blockade Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Since the United States stopped producing diesel submarines long
ago, its contractors will have to cooperate with their European
counterparts to build the subs for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, most of the countries that are capable of producing subs
have been reserved about supplying Taiwan with subs for fear of
negatively affecting their relationship with Beijing. The U.S. Navy
has thus been endeavoring to talk those sub makers into cooperating
with the United States on the issue, according to a source from the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has agreed in principle to allocate a "special
budget" of about NT$300 billion-NT$400 billion (US$8.84 billion -
US$11.8 billion) to support the sub procurement project.</P>
      <P>Leboeuf and his group is expected to stay in Taiwan until Oct.

arrived, Lu said, adding that it is time now for all the people of
the country to "adopt a brand new perspective on matters dealing with
internal, diplomatic, as well as cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Lu said that while commemorating Madame Chiang, the Taiwan public
should also emulate the spiritual model that Madame Chiang had laid
-- a model telling that women should bear the same level of
responsibility as their male counterparts to their nation.</P>

she had spent much of her later life after her husband's death in
1975.</P>

MAJORITY CONCERNED ABOUT IMPACT OF LINKS WITH M'LAND ON SECURITY: POLL</P>
      <P>Taipei, Oct. 26 (CNA) Although many people consider that direct
shipping links with mainland China would be a plus for Taiwan's
economic development, more people worry about the impacts of such
links on Taiwan's security, according to the results of a survey
released Sunday.</P>
      <P>The survey, commissioned by the Taiwan Advocates, a group made up
of political followers of former President Lee Teng-hui, found that
57.5 percent of those surveyed said that direct transportation links
with mainland would be a threat to Taiwan's security, while 49.6
percent said they would help Taiwan's economic development.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 52.2 percent of those polled said mainland Chinese
residing in Taiwan have impaired their chances of landing jobs, 65.8
percent said these mainlanders' political rights in Taiwan should be
seriously restricted, 73.6 percent said these mainlanders should not
be allowed to work as government employees, and 46.9 percent said
that the number of 3,600 mainland spouses per year being allowed to
enter the island is too high.</P>
      <P>A total of 52.8 percent of the respondents said direct
transportation links with mainland would accelerate Taiwan's brain
drain and capital flight, while 54.2 percent said the economic and
trade exchanges with mainland China are one of the leading reasons
behind Taiwan's surging unemployment rates.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, 57.5 percent said they believe direct
transportations links with mainland would inevitably harm Taiwan's
security, and 50.2 percent said economic development should be
subordinate to security when the two are in conflict.</P>
      <P>The survey showed that 65.3 percent of the respondents believe
mainland China is hostile toward Taiwan in general, while 49 percent
said they are concerned about the political loyalty of local
politicians who visit the mainland frequently.</P>
      <P>Local businesspeople's calls fro closer economic ties with
mainland China were played down by 74.6 percent of those polled, who
dismissed their opinions as serving their own interests.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by the Focus Survey Research Corporation in
Taichung City, was carried out Oct. 21-22 on 1,062 adults in Taiwan.

    <HEADLINE>NEARLY 20% OF 4TH GRADERS HAVE HAD SUICIDAL THOUGHTS: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 20 percent of fourth graders, or
10-year-olds, in Taipei City and Hsinchu County have had suicidal
thoughts at one time or another, according to a research paper
released Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chiang Yi-chen, a doctoral student at National Taiwan
University's Institute of Public Health and Welfare, interviewed a
total of 2,075 fourth graders from Taipei City and Hsinchu County, as
well as 1,841 mothers and 1,652 fathers of these pupils, as part of
her research into the factors behind suicidal tendencies among
elementary school students.</P>
      <P>According to her survey, 26 percent of the Taipei fourth graders
interviewed said they have thought about committing suicide, while 13
percent of the Hsinchu students said that they have.</P>
      <P>This indicates that children in urban areas are more likely to
succumb to the stress in their daily lives resulting from school or
family relations or other personal reasons, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Chiang also found from the survey results that girls are more
likely to have suicidal thoughts.</P>
      <P>She further concluded that children who live in big cities and
often feel lonely or depressed, or who are not on good terms with
their family members, or have violent tendencies are more likely to
think about committing suicide.</P>
      <P>Chiang said she found that most of the 10-year-olds that she
interviewed are genuinely aware of the meaning of death and what
suicide is.</P>
      <P>Family-related factors, including violence or low income, are
major factors prompting the fourth graders to think about killing
themselves, according to Chiang's report.</P>
      <P>The one child that Chiang found to be the saddest among those she
interviewed was a boy who lives in Taipei City who said he has
attempted suicide three times over the past 17 months, including
jumping from a building, slashing his wrist, and trying to hang
himself.</P>
      <P>The boy, who suffers from tongue problems due to a genetic
defect, said he often feels depressed and bullied, particularly when
he is with his peers at school. Influenced by his family's religious
beliefs, the boy said that he believes in reincarnation and that he
is not at all afraid of dying, according to Chiang.</P>
      <P>Chiang's research is part of a five-year project authorized by
the National Health Research Institute to probe into abnormal
behavior in children and teenagers in Taiwan. The project is being
conducted by several universities in Taiwan, but mainly by National
Taiwan University.</P>

      <P>The Taipei-based Far East Air Transport

      <P>The trip from Taipei to Da Nang takes two hours and 50 minutes,

    <HEADLINE>CSBC CAPABLE OF BUILDING SUBS: GERMAN CONSULTANTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's state-run China Shipbuilding Corp.
(CSBC) is capable of building submarines, given the strength of the
CSBC and the ROC Navy, as well as the capabilities of the private
industrial sector, a consultant group from Germany said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The idea of the CSBC building submarines for Taiwan is by no
means a fantasy, said members of the German consultant group, who
have recently completed a one-week assessment tour of Taiwan, mainly
to CSBC's plants.</P>
      <P>By combining the capabilities and resources of the ROC Navy and
Taiwan's private industrial sector, the CSBC could produce submarines
after upgrading some of its facilities, the German consultants said
in a just-released assessment report.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan established a cross-division ad hoc committee,
headed by Vice Premier Lin Hsin-yi, in January this year to
facilitate plans calling for part of the eight diesel-powered
submarines that the United States has promised to sell to Taiwan to
be built in Taiwan by the CSBC.</P>
      <P>The U.S. government announced in 2001 a robust package of arms it
had agreed to sell to Taiwan, including the eight diesel-powered
submarines.</P>
      <P>Taiwan formally filed a request in 1995 for procurement of the
subs from the United States in an effort to beef up its deterrence
capabilities against possible attempts by mainland China to blockade
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by the assessment results, the CSBC has become more
confident about its potential to partake in the submarine building
project.</P>
      <P>According to CSBC officials, it is hoped that a "2-2-2-2" plan
will be followed in the building of the eight diesel-powered subs,
where the first two subs are built totally in the United States or
elsewhere abroad, one-third of the third and fourth subs are built in
Taiwan, two-thirds of the fifth and sixth subs are manufactured in
Taiwan, and the last two subs are built completely in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Wen-chung from the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) said he believes that the Legislative Yuan will support
the CSBC attempts to co-build the eight subs so long as the overall
manufacturing quality is acceptable, the prices are not abnormally
high and the building period not too long.</P>
      <P>Co-building the subs with the involvement of domestic companies
will help upgrade Taiwan's shipbuilding capabilities and increase job
opportunities for Taiwan citizens, Lee said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT OPTIMISTIC ABOUT JOB MARKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the steady economic recovery and
greater demand from the private sector, the government is optimistic
there will be an improvement in Taiwan's employment market.</P>
      <P>According to the newest forecast by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), Taiwan's jobless rate is
expected to fall below 5 percent in October and to 4.6 percent in
December. The DGBAS also predicted that the average unemployment rate
for the fourth quarter will be around 4.7 percent and that the
average for the whole year will be lower than 5 percent.</P>
      <P>The latest statistics compiled by the DGBAS show that Taiwan's
unemployment rate stood at 5.05 percent in September, down by 0.16
percentage points from the August level, or the largest
August-to-September decline since September 1998. The September
figure also represented a drop of 0.27 percentage points from the
level posted in the same month of last year.</P>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun reported recently at the Legislative Yuan
that unemployment, particularly among the middle-aged and older
workers, will pose a serious threat to social and economic stability,
noting that specially designed measures are required to solve the
problem of joblessness among elderly workers.</P>
      <P>"The whole of society will have to pay a greater cost if
unemployment is not properly resolved in a timely fashion, " he
stressed.</P>
      <P>Pointing to South Korea as example, Yu said the South Korean
government succeeded in reducing the country's unemployment rate from
4.8 percent in 1998 to 3 percent in Nov. 2002 by spending an
equivalent of NT$170.7 billion (about US$5.02 billion) on public
service projects.</P>
      <P>A similar employment-boosting program in Taiwan worth NT$20
billion implemented by the Executive Yuan on June 18 has also started
paying off, with more than 70,000 jobs having been created so far, Yu
pointed out.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan forecast that with the special budget of NT$20
billion, about 75,000 jobs can be created a year and the jobless rate
reduced to less than 4.5 percent.</P>
      <P>In addition, the government took complementary measures to curb
the so-called structural joblessness by lowering the
number of foreign laborers allowed to be introduced into the Taiwan
job market. The government also introduced a job insurance law this
January, allowing unemployed workers to receive government subsidies
to help them deal with their short-term financial straits.</P>
      <P>Job opportunities in the private sector will also gradually
increase for Taiwan's 9 million workers thanks to an improved economy
at home, including temporary jobs with the approach of the Chinese
New Year, according to the DGBAS forecast,</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND-BASED TAIWAN BUSINESSMAN RELEASED AFTER FAMILY PAYS RANSOM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A mainland China-based Taiwan businessman
who was kidnapped in Dongguan, Guangdong, last week was reportedly
released Sunday after his family paid a ransom of US$1.68 million.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan businessman, whose name was withheld, was reportedly
abducted at midnight last Wednesday when he was driving home with a
friend after a KTV party in Dongguan.</P>
      <P>Two days later, the Dongguan-based kidnappers called the
businessman's wife in Taichung, Taiwan, telling her to pay the ransom
-- one of the highest in recent years related to cross-strait
kidnappings -- at a central Taiwan roadside point along the Sun
Yat-sen Freeway at midnight of the same day.</P>
      <P>The ransom was paid in accordance with the kidnappers'
instructions, but because the wife of the businessman did not hear
from him after paying the ransom, she made an emergency call to a
Taichung City councilman for help at around noon Saturday.</P>
      <P>The businessman's wife finally received a call from her husband
Sunday morning telling her that he had been released by his
kidnappers.</P>
      <P>As of Sunday, four of the businessman's alleged abductors had
been arrested by Dongguan public security authorities, according to
Taiwan's Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) officials, who have been
in contact with their Dongguan counterparts for information on the
case.</P>
      <P>Mainland police are currently working to find out the identity of
the four abductors, their motives and whether the kidnapping ring's
mastermind is in Taiwan, the CIB said.</P>
      <P>According to the CIB officials, the businessman's wife tried to
haggle the ransom down to about US$1 million, telling the kidnappers
that the amount of U.S. dollars in cash that they were asking for was
difficult to obtain in a single day. However, the kidnappers firmly
insisted on the original ransom amount.</P>
      <P>CIB police said they believe that the kidnapping ring's
mastermind, who they claim is well aware of the financial status of
the businessman's family, is currently in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The businessman is reportedly returning to Taiwan Monday,
according to CIB authorities and Taichung City police, who are
continuing their investigations into the case.</P>

MOU and said it will enhance the international competitiveness and
edge of the students, expand their horizons and increase their
employment opportunities, as well as help ease the oversupply of
nurses in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The School of Nursing of Queensland University of Technology was
established in 1978 and is the oldest and largest center for tertiary
nursing education in Queensland.</P>

      <P>Taiwan held bilateral talks with 10 states
and has improved bilateral ties with at least 15 states on the
fringes of a ministerial conference of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum in Bangkok, an economics official who
returned after the conference said Monday.</P>
      <P>In a briefing to the legislature, Huang Chih-peng,
director-general of the Foreign Trade Bureau, said that the Republic
of China (ROC) delegation to the 15th APEC Ministerial Meeting, which

      <P>Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Japan expressed interest in

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT HOPES TO GIVE MADAME CHIANG KAI-SHEK GRAND BURIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will assist the family of
Madame Chiang Kai-shek to bury her in the most grand manner if her
family agrees to let the government handle the funeral and other
related arrangements, an Executive Yuan spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chia-lung said that Chiou I-jen, secretary-general of the
Presidential Office, has been instructed by President Chen Shui-bian
to coordinate the matter, paying attention to the legal and protocol
aspects.</P>
      <P>Lin said that if the Chiang family agrees to let the government
handle the funeral, the national funeral law will be invoked to
provide the most grand funeral for Chiang, who died in New York
Thursday at the age of 106.</P>
      <P>Lin noted, however, that since the revised national funeral law
was passed in 1948, no national leaders, including Chiang's late
husband Chiang Kai-shek, former president Yen Chia-kan, and former
vice president Shieh Tung-min, have ever been buried under the
framework of the law, so there is therefore no precedent to follow.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office will discuss the matter with the Chiang
family and the Executive Yuan will work according to instructions
from the Presidential Office, Lin added.</P>
      <P>The national funeral law stipulates that Republic of China
nationals who have done distinguished work or who have made great
contributions to the nation that have enhanced the national glory or
human welfare can be honored with a national funeral. In such cases,
the president would send officials to pay their respects to the
deceased at the funeral, while flags would be flown at half-mast on
that day.</P>
      <P>Reports have said that Chiang left no will or burial instructions
and her family is divided over her final resting place. Some wish her
body to be returned to Taiwan, while others want her to be buried in
New York at a cemetery in which several of her family members,
including her sister and brother, are interred.</P>
      <P>Madame Chiang's life was inextricably linked with the history of
modern China and Taiwan and she is credited with using her
Western-educated background to lobby for China during its fight
against the Japanese in the 1940s, as well as her devotion to women's
rights and charity work.</P>
      <P>She spent most of her time in seclusion in New York after her
husband's death in 1975.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) under the Executive Yuan has set Taiwan's economic
growth rate target for 2004 at 4.7 percent, according to a national
development program approved Monday by the government's top economic
planning agency.</P>
      <P>CEPD Vice Chairwoman Ho Mei-yueh said that the "challenging
target" can be achieved if a NT$500 billion (US$14.8 billion) program
for expanding public construction in five years can be carried out
smoothly and the existing program for increasing job opportunities
can continue.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economic growth was registered at 1.73 percent in the
first half of this year due to the impact of the outbreaks of severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Ho noted, adding that the growth
rate is expected to reach 4.32 percent in the second half of the
year.</P>
      <P>According to the latest report on Taiwan's economic situation
published by the CEPD, the country's economy enjoyed steady growth in
September and is expected to continue to grow, she went on,
predicting that the annual growth rate will reach 3.06 percent as
estimated by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics.</P>
      <P>Looking forward to the prospects for the next year, Ho predicted
that private investment will increase by 7.11 percent, while the
unemployment rate will fall to 4.5 percent and the consumer price
index will move up 0.7 percent.</P>

    <DATELINE>Hsinchu,  Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that
the Republic of China hopes to forge closer cooperative relations
with all Asian countries for the mutual benefit of all.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of the seventh annual meeting of the Asian
Science Parks Association (ASPA) at the government-funded Industrial
Technology Research Institute (ITRI) , Chen said regional economic
integration has become a prevailing world trend.</P>
      <P>In the face of this wave of integration, Chen said, the ROC will
make every possible effort to develop constructive interaction with
all Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan sits on a strategic location between Northeast
and Southeast Asia and ranks among the world's top four exporters of
high-tech products, Chen said his administration will do its utmost
to forge closer ties with its Asian neighbors based on the existing
frameworks.</P>
      <P>As research and innovation hold the key to high-tech industrial
development, Chen went on, Taiwan has set up many research
laboratories to encourage the development of innovative technologies
and help aspiring businessmen to launch high-tech ventures.</P>
      <P>These innovative centers, plus the island's three core
science-based industrial parks in Hsinchu, Taichung and Tainan, have
formed a "technology corridor" in western Taiwan that will play the
role of locomotive to turn Taiwan into a "green silicon island," home
to environmentally friendly high-tech industries, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He lauded the ITRI for its contributions that have helped nurture
many new high-tech companies on the island over the past seven years.</P>
      <P>"Since the ITRI set up an open laboratory seven years ago, it has
successfully helped create 110 high-tech firms, with an accumulated
paid-in capital of NT$41 billion, " Chen noted, adding that the ITRI
is the most suitable organization to represent Taiwan in organizing
the 2003 ASPA annual conference.</P>
      <P>About 200 representatives from science-based industrial parks in
11 Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea and mainland China,
are attending the ASPA annual meeting.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will pay his
respects to the late Madame Chiang Kai-shek when he makes a transit
stop in New York at the end of this month on his way to Panama for an
official visit, a Presidential Office spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>Joseph Wu, deputy secretary-general to the president, said Chen
is adjusting his itinerary in New York in order to pay his respects
to the memory of Chiang, who died at her Manhattan home last Thursday
at the age of 106.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to leave Taipei Oct. 31 and Wu said the
president plans to pay his respects to the late Republic of China
first lady immediately after his arrival in New York.</P>
      <P>"The Presidential Office is still consulting with the ROC
representative office in the United States and Madame Chiang's family
on technical details," Wu said.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, Chen attaches great importance to Chiang's
funeral.</P>
      <P>"Chen has said that Madame Chiang's funeral is not a personal
affair, but rather a national affair. He has directed his chief of
staff, Chiou I-jen, to consult with the Chiang family and to assist
in the funeral arrangements, " Wu said, adding that Chen wants all
relevant government agencies to assist in making the best possible
funeral arrangements.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, Chen has instructed that all national flags will
fly at half-mast on the day of Chiang's funeral.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Wu went on, Chen will issue a posthumous commendation
in honor of Chiang for her contribution to the ROC, particularly in
the diplomatic field.</P>
      <P>Commenting on local press reports that Chiang's niece Kung
Ling-yi has expressed the hope that Chen will personally drape an ROC
national flag upon Chiang's coffin at the funeral, an unidentified
Presidential Office official claimed that there is no precedent in
world history for such a thing.</P>
      <P>He added, however, that when Chen pays his respects, he will
present a large ROC national flag to the Chiang family that can be
draped upon the coffin at the funeral.</P>
      <P>Due to his busy schedule, the official added, Chen might not be
able to attend the memorial service.</P>
      <P>Chen will leave New York for Panama Nov. 2 to attend the Central
American country's Nov. 3 centennial celebrations.</P>
      <P>Chiang led a reclusive life at her Manhattan home for much of her
later life after her husband -- the late ROC President Chiang
Kai-shek -- died in 1975.</P>
      <P>Born Soong Mayling, Chiang became widely known in the West as a
spokeswoman for Chinese efforts to resist the Japanese forces that
began invading China in the 1930s.</P>
      <P>After the Chinese Communist Party took control of the mainland,
the ROC government, under her husband's leadership, moved its seat to
Taiwan in 1949. Chiang and his U.S.-educated wife became Asia's
foremost anti-communist symbols.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MUST STRENGTHEN REGIONAL RESOURCES: ECONOMICS MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Yi-fu said
Monday that to prepare for mainland Chinese capital coming into
Taiwan, the island should strengthen its position as an integrator of
regional resources.</P>
      <P>Lin made the comments in a report delivered at the Legislative
Yuan in the wake of the legislature's clearing earlier this month of
a revised law governing exchanges between the people of Taiwan and
mainland China.</P>
      <P>The revised Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of
the Taiwan Area and the Mainland made major revisions to such major
topics as cross-strait direct transportation, mainland Chinese
capital entering Taiwan and the circulation of mainland China's
currency, the renminbi, in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin said that in line with the revision of the statute, Taiwan
should strengthen its position as an integrator of regional resources
and encourage foreign companies to set up operational headquarters,
research and development facilities and logistics centers in Taiwan
to facilitate their inroads into the mainland.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, Taiwan should accelerate its industrial
upgrading and build a comprehensive infrastructure to induce foreign
companies to make investment in Taiwan one of their priorities.</P>
      <P>On the entry of mainland Chinese capital to Taiwan, Lin said
the government will regularly review the items opened to mainland
China and open others in stages. If mainland investment becomes
overheated or "abnormal, " then the ministry will adopt appropriate
measures to cut the economic risk.</P>
      <P>The government will also review goods imported from the mainland
and will step up its defense mechanism against mainland products
under the framework of the World Trade Organization so as to use the
trend of the division of labor on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to
invigorate Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Statistics released by the Ministry of Economic Affairs show that
trade with the mainland amounted to US$24.56 billion in the first
seven months of this year, accounting for 22.2 percent of Taiwan's
total foreign trade. Of this figure, exports to the mainland totaled
US$18.83 billion, up 18.7 percent from the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>In comparison, Taiwan imported US$5.73 billion-worth of goods in
the first seven months, up 35.3 percent, accounting for 8.3 percent
of Taiwan's total imports and giving the country a trade surplus of
US$13.1 billion.</P>
      <P>Mainland China is the largest export destination of Taiwan and
the third-largest source of imports, as well as the largest trade
surplus source.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has invested an aggregated US$32.97 billion on the
mainland since 1981 when it first started keeping records, accounting
for 49.1 percent of Taiwan's outbound investment.</P>
      <P>The mainland has become the largest destination for Taiwan
investment, which is mainly focused on the traditional manufacturing
industry in provinces such as Jiangxu, Guangdong and Fujian.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will set up
an insurance crime prevention center to cope with ever-growing
fraudulent insurance claims, a senior official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Political Vice Minister of Finance Susan Chang made the remarks at
ameeting of the Legislative Yuan's Budget and Final Accounts
Committee.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, opposition Kuomintang Legislator Lo Ming-tsai
said that amid the current economic doldrums, there have been a
number of reports of fraudulent insurance claims. "How can the MOF
help insurers handle those cases?" he asked.</P>
      <P>In reply, Chang said the MOF has decided to earmark money from
the ministry's NT$3.5 billion Insurance Industry Development Fund to
form an insurance crime prevention center.</P>
      <P>The new center will collaborate with insurers and law enforcement
authorities to intercept fraudulent insurance claims, Chang said.</P>
      <P>In another news development, Administrative Vice Finance Minister
Yang Tzu-chiang confirmed at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's
Finance Committee that from Jan. 1, 2004 all people who intend to
open accounts at local banks must have their photos taken by banks
with digital cameras.</P>
      <P>"The new measure is part of the government's efforts to stop the
increasing prevalence of 'figurehead' bank accounts, which are often
used for criminal purposes," Yang said.</P>
      <P>He said although taking fingerprints is the most effective way to
prevent the opening of 'figurehead' bank account, the nation has yet
to reach a consensus on such a measure.</P>
      <P>"As a substitute measure, would-be bank account applicants will
be asked to have their photos taken from the beginning of next year,"
Yang said, adding those photos are expected to offer clues for law
enforcement officers in probing financial crimes in the future.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A 12-year-old Iraqi boy who was maimed
during the U. S. bombing of Iraq arrived in Taipei Monday to receive
medical treatment that may include fitting prostheses.</P>
      <P>Khaldon-Kh-Thiab, who lost his right hand and left foot as a
result of U.S. bombing, is scheduled to stay in Taiwan two months to
receive check-ups and treatment mainly at the Far Eastern Memorial
Hospital, according to a spokesman for the Eden Social Welfare
Foundation, which sponsored the Iraqi boy's Taiwan trip.</P>
      <P>Doctors at the Far Eastern Memorial Hospital are expected to
treat the boy's injuries before deciding on the nature of the
prostheses, the Eden spokesman said.</P>
      <P>According to the Eden foundation, Khaldon-Kh-Thiab was playing
with two of his younger brothers in the courtyard of their house when
U.S. bombers swept across the skies of Fallujah near Baghdad.</P>
      <P>The boys fled the courtyard and went inside their house where
they waited. After about one hour, when the bombing had stopped, they
ventured outside. The boys began investigating what turned out to be
unexploded ordinance. The subsequent detonation killed the two
younger boys instantly and maimed Khaldon-Kh-Thiab.</P>
      <P>Khaldon-Kh-Thiab's family has 28 children. Three have been killed
in the war. Only eight of them have been able to attend school with
their father's subsistence wage of US$5 a month.</P>
      <P>Before the war, Khaldon-Kh-Thiab was a happy boy who liked to
play football and shoot the breeze. His greatest dream was to become
a driver.</P>
      <P>The Eden Social Welfare Foundation, one of the major charitable
organizations in Taiwan, which has continued to help the poor and
needy at home and abroad, decided to sponsor Khaldon-Kh-Thiab's
Taiwan trip after receiving a report from the United Nations
Children's Fund in July.</P>
      <P>According to the UNCF report, at the height of the U.S.-led war
against Iraq early this year, one of the major hospitals in Baghdad
reported the admission of 100 injured people every hour. During the
first month of the war, the hospital was forced to amputate the limbs
of more than 100 children who had been injured by bombings or
shootings.</P>
      <P>The Hashemite Charitable Society for Soldiers with Special Needs
in Jordan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' liaison office in
Jordan have been largely instrumental in arranging Khaldon-Kh-Thiab's
trip to Taiwan, according to the Eden spokesman.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MUST DECREASE RELIANCE ON MAINLAND ECONOMY: PFP LAWMAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition lawmaker urged the Ministry
of Economic Affairs (MOEA) Monday to rein in Taiwan's increasing
dependence on mainland China for its export growth.</P>
      <P>Legislator Christina Y. Liu of the People First Party said
Taiwan's exports to the United States, Japan and Europe have
continued declining in recent years while its exports to mainland
China have risen consistently at a rapid rate.</P>
      <P>Quoting MOEA tallies, Liu said Taiwan's exports to the United
States, Japan and Europe dropped 3.5 percent, 6.8 percent and 6.9
percent, respectively, in 2002 on a year-on-year basis.</P>
      <P>In the first eight months of this year, exports to the United
States fell 5 percent from the same period last year, while sales to
Japan also declined 3.8 percent.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Liu said, Taiwan's exports to mainland China,
including sales to Hong Kong, registered a whopping 96 percent growth
in 2002 as compared with the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the huge gain in exports to mainland China, Liu said
Taiwan managed to register positive growth in its overall exports
last year.</P>
      <P>"This phenomenon is worrisome because the mainland Chinese
economy faces a host of problems and risks, including the exchange
rate of the mainland currency, the huge non-performing loans by
mainland banks and the uncertainty regarding whether the mainland
economy can withstand the opening of its financial market in 2006 as
it promised in its World Trade Organization entry protocol, " Liu
explained.</P>
      <P>Noting that exports have been a key factor to Taiwan's economic
growth, Liu said the island's ever-growing reliance on the mainland
market will make the Taiwan economy vulnerable to adverse changes in
the mainland's economic development.</P>
      <P>Liu said the MOEA should work out effective measures to diversify
Taiwan's export market and reduce its reliance on the mainland
market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REFERENDUMS ARE BASIC RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE: KMT CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Referendums are a basic right of the people
of the Republic of China in accordance with the nation's
Constitution, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan said
Monday.</P>
      <P>The KMT has never said that referendums are not workable in
Taiwan or that they should not be held in Taiwan, Lien claimed at a
press conference held at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport upon
his return from an overseas trip.</P>
      <P>Lien's trip, which took him to London, Prague and the east and
west coasts of the United States, is widely considered as being part
of his presidential campaign activities.</P>
      <P>Lien, a former ROC vice president, ended a distant third in the
hotly-contested 2000 presidential election. He will team up with
People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong to challenge President
Chen Shui-bian's re-election bid next year.</P>
      <P>Referendums, designed to allow the people to vote on issues of
public interest, should be organized by the people, rather than the
government, Lien said.</P>
      <P>He ridiculed the Democratic Progressive Pary-ruled government's
linking of referendums with the 2004 presidential election, asking
whether the government's only job is to promote referendums.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lien said the "one China" policy that he has been
advocating refers to the Republic of China on Taiwan. The "one
Republic of China" policy is the fundamental strategic weapon in
efforts at seeking peace across the Taiwan Strait and is a policy
that is acceptable to all the people in Taiwn, he added.</P>
      <P>PFP Chairman James Soong and scores of legislators from the KMT
and the PFP, commonly known as the "pan-blue alliance, " joined Lien
at the press conference.</P>

    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Singapore health economist said over
the weekend that local researchers should work out how cost-effective
a new drug is in addition to studying its curative powers when they
conduct clinical trials.</P>
      <P>Phua Kai Hong, an associate professor at National University of
Singapore (NUS) , said that if this is not done, Singapore's bid to
become a regional medical center may be thwarted.</P>
      <P>Phua was speaking to about 220 doctors and pharmacists, including
some from Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan, at a symposium on health
economics. The two-day symposium was organized by NUS, Tan Tock Seng
Hospital and Pfizer Singapore.</P>
      <P>"Drug companies are coming to Singapore now because we have a
reputation for producing quality drugs that are safe and effective, "
Phua said.</P>
      <P>"We need to add cost-effectiveness to that list to make us more
competitive," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>This would entail researchers collecting extra data on such
things as the length of a patient's stay in hospital and the loss of
productivity from a drugs side effects, he said.</P>
      <P>The pharmaceutical industry has in the last few years tried to
respond to the demand for this sort of additional information on new
drugs, said Dr. Sandeep Duttagupta, director of Pfizer
Pharmaceuticals Group's outcomes research unit in New York.</P>
      <P>He cited the example of the clinical trials for a new antibiotic
in which the expected length of hospital stay for patients using the
drug was included in the findings. The new drug was found to reduce
hospital stays by three to seven days, meaning reduced costs to both
patient and hospital.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CAUSE OF TRANS ASIA CARGO CARRIER CRASH REMAINS UNKNOWN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Bad weather has not been ruled out as the
cause of the crash late last year of a cargo carrier belonging to
Trans Asia Airways off the island county of Penghu, a spokesman for
the Flight Safety Council under the Executive Yuan said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>An initial investigation conducted by the council showed no
evidence of serious icing or turbulence during the flight of the
ATR72 cargo plane from Taipei to Macau in the small hours of Dec. 21
last year, chief investigator Chou Kuang-tsang reported, adding that
the probe will now focus on pilot error, weather equipment failure
and aircraft maintenance to find out the cause of the accident.</P>
      <P>Chou pointed out, however, that a possible fault that could have
arisen from air traffic control, flight facilities and
telecommunications systems has been temporarily excluded from the
list of factors that could have led to the crash.</P>
      <P>He forecast that the entire investigation will be complete by the
end of 2004.</P>
      <P>Although information contained in the plane's cockpit voice
recorder and flight data recorder indicates that the plane was
subjected to serious icing during the flight, Chou noted that none of
the weather authorities in Taiwan, Hong Kong or Naha in
Okinawa issued warnings of icing over the Taiwan and Penghu area.</P>
      <P>According to the rules established by The International Civil
Aviation Organization, weather authorities are obliged to issue such
a warning to the whole world only when the icing problem is serious.
Meteorologists in the Hong Kong and Naha flight information areas
found only medium icing on the day in question.</P>
      <P>Noting that the council has yet to continue seeking the cause of
the accident, Chou reported that ATR42/72 planes registered eight
accidents related to icing during the 1994-2002 period. He added that
the council has urged aviation companies to emphasize the icing
problem to pilots through proper training.</P>
      <P>The bodies of the plane's pilot and co-pilot have not been

    <HEADLINE>MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR MADAME CHIANG TO BE HELD NOV. 5</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York,  Oct.  27 (CNA)
(By Eric Tseng and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A memorial service for the late Madame
Chiang Kai-shek, Taiwan's most famous first lady, will be held at St.
Bartholomew's Church in Manhattan Nov. 5, her family said Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's representative office in New York -- the Taipei Economic
and Cultural Office -- is expected to issue a press release on
details regarding the memorial service Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chiang's body is being kept at the Franklin E. Campell funeral
house and her family is considering choosing a day during this week
to open her coffin for public viewing. Meanwhile, her family plans to
invite 1,000 people to attend the funeral.</P>
      <P>Chiang, the glamorous, U.S.-educated Republic of China first lady
who helped her husband -- the late President Chiang Kai-shek -- rule
mainland China and later Taiwan during years of war, upheaval and
Cold War tension, died at her New York home Oct. 24 at the age of
106.</P>
      <P>Former ROC Premier Hau Pei-tsun arrived in New York over the
weekend to pay his respects to Chiang's memory and described her as
one of the most outstanding women of the 20th century. "Her
contributions to the ROC can hardly be epitomized by a grand
funeral," Hau added.</P>
      <P>Many of Chiang's relatives, friends and former aides and proteges
have flown to New York to pay their respects and assist in funeral
arrangements.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, President Chen Shui-bian will pay his respects to the
late ROC first lady when he makes a transit stop in New York at the
end of this month on his way to Panama for an official visit.</P>
      <P>Chen has instructed that all national flags will be flown at
half-mast on the day of Chiang's funeral. Moreover, Chen will issue a
posthumous commendation in honor of Chiang for her contributions to
the ROC, particularly in the diplomatic field.</P>
      <P>When Chen pays his respects, he will present a large ROC national
flag to the Chiang family that can be draped upon the coffin at her
funeral.</P>
      <P>As Chen will leave New York for Panama Nov. 2 to attend the
Central American country's Nov. 3 centennial celebrations, he will
not attend the memorial service.</P>
      <P>The Chiangs were once one of the most famous couples in the world
-- a dashing general married to a beautiful, urbane woman. Time
magazine publisher Henry Luce named them "Man and Woman of the Year"
in 1938.</P>
      <P>Madame Chiang led a reclusive life at her Manhattan home for much
of her later life after her husband died in 1975. Born Soong
Mei-ling, Chiang became widely known in the West as a spokeswoman for
Chinese efforts to resist the Japanese forces that began invading
China in the 1930s.</P>
      <P>After the Chinese Communist Party took control of the mainland,
the Republic of China government, under her husband's leadership,
moved its seat to Taiwan in 1949. Chiang and his wife became Asia's
foremost anti-communist symbols.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese Falun Gong follower who was
detained by mainland Chinese authorities during a recent visit to
Shanghai had been released and has returned home, the Taiwan Falun
Dafa Association (TFDA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Lin Hsiao-kai returned to his home in the central county of
Changhua Monday evening, " TFDA President Chang Ching-hsi told local
reporters.</P>
      <P>Chang said Lin was haggard due to grueling questioning by
mainland law enforcement officers during his detention in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>"Lin will brief the press on his ordeal after he has recovered
from his nightmare," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Lin left for Shanghai Sept. 30 to do some sightseeing and visit
friends. His family in Taiwan lost contact with him Oct. 7 and his
wife called a news conference at the Legislative Yuan Oct. 21,
pleading for help in rescuing her husband and urging the mainland
authorities to release Lin immediately. Her appeal drew concern from
lawmakers and local human rights activists.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, Lin was not tortured but was subjected to
long hours of repeated questioning in an incident that Chang said
epitomizes mainland China's attitude toward human rights.</P>
      <P>Falun Gong is outlawed by the mainland authorities, who consider
it to be a dangerous cult, but it is a legal social or
quasi-religious organization in Taiwan, where its adherents number
more than 300,000.</P>
      <P>Chang said the mainland's inhumane treatment of Lin and many
other Falun Gong followers only serves to further alienate the people
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that freedoms of assembly and association are basic human
rights, Chang said the mainland's brutal suppression of Falun Gong
followers has tarnished its international image.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang and 19 other TFDA members launched an islandwide
bicycle journey Tuesday to enlist public support for a campaign to
push the mainland authorities to release some 20 mainland-born TFDA
members who have been detained during visits to their mainland
hometowns.</P>
      <P>"It seems to me that the mainland authorities especially like to
arrest female mainland-born Falun Gong followers who have married
Taiwan men," Chang said.</P>
      <P>At least one of them has obtained Taiwan citizenship, but she is
still in jail on the mainland because she is a Falun Gong member,
Chang said.</P>
      <P>In another case, a mainland wife of a Taiwanese Falun Gong
follower was arrested in September 1998 when she returned to her
parents' home in Jinlin in northeastern China. After serving a
two-year prison term, she was released on parole, but the mainland
authorities still will not allow her to be reunited with her husband
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 20 TFDA members will cycle around the island to seek the
signatures of local people in support of their campaign.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Tuesday that
Taiwan will study whether to bring in additional Iraqi children who
were injured in the United States-led attacks for advanced medical
treatment.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hsu Chung-hsiung of the opposition Kuomintang proposed
in a general interpellation session of the Legislative Yuan that the
government let Iraqi children come to Taiwan for medical treatment
under the brokerage of international organizations.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who himself is disabled, said that in the opening days of
the U.S.-led attacks, he suggested that 50 Iraqi children wounded in
the bombing come to 10 medical centers in Taiwan, or each medical
center accommodating five children.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that the Department of Health agreed then, but the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs interceded, and the plan was aborted.</P>
      <P>The legislator's remarks came at a time when a 12-year-old Iraqi
boy who lost his right hand and left foot during the war arrived the
previous night under the sponsorship of a private charitable
organization dedicated to the care of the handicapped.</P>
      <P>Hsu pointed out that Taiwan gave NT$150 million (US$4.41 million)
toward war effort, but he wondered what effect the money had had in
terms of diplomacy.</P>
      <P>Responding to his questions, Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene
Chien said that after the beginning of the Iraq War, the ministry,
heeded the advice of legislators and contacted relevant agencies to
express the intention of bringing in Iraqi children to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But as Taiwan was fighting its own battle against severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) at the time, and a great number of
medical institutions had their hands full, the program to help the
Iraqi children was put on hold, Chien said.</P>
      <P>He said that the NT$150 million (US$4.41 million) aid was not
much compared with other countries and that the money was largely
spent on food aid, which he said should have been noticed in the
international community.</P>
      <P>The premier said that he would undertake to study the proposal by
Legislator Hsu that Taiwan uses its "imagination and creativity" to
try to break through its diplomatic difficulties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ELECTION A MATTER OF KEEPING RESPONSIBILITY FOR REFORMS: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that
winning the presidential election next year is important for the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) so that it can continue
shouldering the responsibility of implementing reforms, not simply to
remain the ruling party of the nation.</P>
      <P>President Chen, who concurrently serves as DPP chairman, made the
remarks at a regular meeting of the DPP Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>The president pointed to the rally in the southern city of
Kaohsiung last Saturday which attracted more than 200,000 people in
support of referendum legislation and the formulation of a new
constitution as proof of a milestone in Taiwan's democratic movement.</P>
      <P>"It is heartwarming and stimulating to see the people come
forward to support democratic reforms with actions, " the president
said.</P>
      <P>For this reason, the president said he wanted to express his
gratitude the efforts of the party and the support of the people and
vowed to continue to work hard with "humility, solidarity,
responsibility and confidence."</P>
      <P>He said that the large turnout was an indication that the DPP's
"promotion of referendum legislation and the formulation of a new
constitution" have won the support and identification of the majority
of Taiwan people, a situation that he said will not make the party
complacent, but will make it act "with humility. "</P>
      <P>"The people of Taiwan have given the DPP a key to democratic
reforms, " the president said. "After the door to democracy opened
with the transfer of power in 2000, the road ahead was still rough
and bumpy, " he said, "but the party has continued to work hard
against adversity to reap the fruits of democracy."</P>
      <P>He stressed that the grand task of democratic reforms will not be
accomplished by one individual or one party alone, but must rely on
national solidarity. Chen said he hoped that all 23 million people on
the island will support democratic reforms.</P>
      <P>He also said that since the inception of his party 17 years ago,
the DPP has taken to heart the people's aspirations for democracy and
their expectations of reforms.</P>
      <P>After the DPP took the helm of the nation in 2000, public
expectation was even higher, and the party's responsibility was
greater, he said. Whether it is to "fight for the economy" or
complete a "major reform" advocated by the DPP, the goal is to
fulfill the expectations of the people and make Taiwan and its people
better off.</P>
      <P>The president stressed that the significance of the presidential
election next year will not be to maintain power, but to continue
having the responsibility of the nation within its mandate because
democracy in Taiwan has to be deepened, and the DPP also has to stay
the course with its reforms.</P>
      <P>He said that the party has encountered numerous difficulties
since becoming the ruling party more than three years ago, but that
it has never lost confidence.</P>
      <P>The president said the DPP believes in "democracy, in reforms,
and in Taiwan," adding that after sweat and tears, the people are now
gradually seeing the results of steady progress, whether it be
dynamism in the private sector, the government's willingness to carry
out reforms or the upgrading of competitiveness of the nation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLARS WARN OF SOCIAL FRICTION ARISING FROM MAINLAND WORKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  28 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government must pay greater heed to
social friction which might arise from an increasing number of
mainland Chinese workers in Taiwan due to worsening unemployment
resulting from a structural joblessness in the domestic market,
according to some scholars.</P>
      <P>Lin Hsiang-kai, a professor of economics at National Taiwan
University (NTU), made the call over the weekend at a news conference
after Taiwan Advocates, a group dedicated to Taiwan independence,
made public the results of a survey which showed that Taiwan people
would be concerned about national security if the government allows
the opening of direct transportation links with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lin claimed that the government must pay full attention to the
costs that the entire society might have to pay should a larger
number of mainland Chinese people be allowed to work in Taiwan,
because Taiwan is troubled by structural joblessness at present.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, only public servants, police and military
officers, ranking white-collar executives, hi-tech professionals and
students are less affected by the increasing number of mainland
Chinese workers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin Wan-i, an NTU professor of social services, said elderly
unskilled workers with low educational backgrounds, are the most
threatened group in the face of the continued entry of workers from
mainland China.</P>
      <P>There are estimated to be more than 50,000 mainland Chinese
workers in Taiwan currently, including fishermen working aboard
Taiwan fishing boats, spouses and relatives of Taiwan residents and
illegal stowaways, he added, noting that a vast majority of them are
employed in high-risk and labor-intensive sectors.</P>
      <P>He called on the government to weigh the issue rationally and
thoroughly on the grounds that an influx of mainland Chinese workers
into the domestic job market has fueled public resentment against the
mainland.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey carried out by the Focus Survey Research
Corporation from Oct. 21-22 polled 1,062 Taiwan residents aged over
20.</P>
      <P>Just over 57 percent of the respondents said that opening direct
transportation links across the Taiwan Strait will undermine Taiwan's
national security, ahead of 49.6 percent who believe it will be
helpful to Taiwan's economic development. About 65 percent thought
that the mainland is hostile toward Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS ROLL SUSHI TO BOOST RICE CONSUMPTION AND HELP FARMERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of lawmakers from the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) took part in a
sushi making and eating contest in the Legislative Yuan Tuesday to
encourage rice consumption and help local farmers make a living.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Cho Po-yuan invited chefs from a local
Japanese-style food store chain to offer tips on preparing sushi with
locally grown fine-quality rice. Many KMT and PFP lawmakers then
began competing making and eating sushi.</P>
      <P>Cho said although Taiwan is currently in its second rice harvest
of the year, most local farmer are heartbroken to see that the price
of rice has dropped to a 20-year low of NT$10 per kilogram, far lower
than the minimum price of NT$15.22 eligible to receive government
emergency relief subsidies.</P>
      <P>"With the price of rice at such a low level, local farmers are
having a hard time making a living. They lose at least NT$2,000 for
planting one-tenth of a hectare of rice," Cho noted.</P>
      <P>He said locally grown "koshi hikari" rice -- a rice strain
originating from Japan, which is usually used for sushi production --
can match its Japanese counterpart in terms of quality, while its
price is far cheaper.</P>
      <P>Rice paddies in Ilan County's Wuchieh township, Changhua County
and Taitung County all produce fine-quality "koshi hikari" rice.
"Top-grade locally grown 'koshi hikari' rice is sold for only NT$40
per kilogram, far lower than that for imported Japanese rice, " Cho
said.</P>
      <P>He urged local people to eat an additional half bowl of rice per
meal to help local farmers tide over their difficulties resulting
from increasing foreign competition and overproduction.</P>
      <P>Cho said the government should also raise financial subsidies for
farmers who have been forced to leave their rice paddies fallow to
avoid overproduction.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON SARS OPENS IN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An international symposium on influenza and
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) opened Tuesday night and
will include three days of seminars starting Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The symposium is being sponsored by the Cabinet-level Department
of Health (DOH), which will also conduct drills on transporting SARS
patients from the outlying islands of Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu to
Taiwan proper for treatment.</P>
      <P>Su Yi-jen, director of the DOH's Center for Disease Control, said
that participants in the symposium will discuss possible transmission
channels from animals to human beings.</P>
      <P>This will be the second time that the DOH has sponsored an
international SARS symposium since April 20. Epidemiologists and
virus experts from the United States, Canada, Germany, Japan,
Singapore, Hong Kong and Vietnam are taking part in the symposium and
more than 100 papers will be read.</P>
      <P>The DOH had originally wanted to invite Zhong Nanshan, who is
known to be the father of SARS research in mainland China, to visit
Taiwan, but he was unable to come due to other engagements.</P>
      <P>Researchers say they suspect about 10 percent of the workers in
meat markets in the southeastern province of Guangdong had come into
contact with the virus that causes SARS but were not infected,
leading researchers to speculate that there was some sort of immunity
in those individuals</P>
      <P>Researchers are keen to understand why these people did not
develop full-blown symptoms of SARS.</P>
      <P>Taiwan scientists are also interested in the nature of the SARS
virus that is found in such animals as civets, fowl and snakes, and
whether it has made the jump to humans.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was hard hit by the pneumonia-like disease between March
and June this year. Official statistics in Taiwan included 84 as
dying from SARS, but the World Health Organization's revised total
for the island is 37. The losses in the tourism and aviation sectors
are hard to estimate.</P>
      <P>Taiwan hopes to be well prepared for any resurgence of the
atypical pneumonia.</P>

      <P>About nine-tenths of the members of
Taiwan's five major service sectors receive failing grades for their
telephone information services, according to the results of a survey
released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Only about one-tenth of the operators of tourist hotels,
department stores, discount supermarket chain-stores, convenience
stores or franchise restaurants were found to have provided useful
and satisfactory front-line telephone information service, according
to the survey conducted by Global Views Monthly.</P>
      <P>The Global View Monthly pollsters made 1,216 phone calls under
the guise of ordinary customers to 58 tourist hotels, department
stores, discount chain-stores, convenience stores and franchise
restaurants between Oct. 3-10, finding that only one-tenth of the
telephone information service personnel rated a 60 or above on a
scale of 100 in telephone courtesy, professional knowledge and
empathy.</P>
      <P>The survey found that about 70 percent of the telephone service
personnel phoned could not provide a clear introduction or
explanation regarding their establishment's products or services.</P>
      <P>A high of 80 percent of the operators displayed poor performance
in the category of empathy -- or the ability to effectively handle
questions raised by critical or rude callers, the survey found.</P>
      <P>The Shin-Kong Mitsukoshi Department Store topped all operators in
the five major service sectors with the best telephone information
services.</P>
      <P>By sector, Wellcome topped all supermarket chain-stores in regard
to telephone information service, the Landis Taipei Hotel (previously
the Ritz Taipei) ranked No. 1 among all tourist hotels in Taiwan, TGI
Fridays led all franchise restaurants and 7-Eleven topped all
convenience stores, the survey found.</P>
      <P>The pollsters obtained 608 valid responses out of the 1,216 calls
made. The poll is said to have a margin of error of 3 percent.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said
Tuesday that it plans to hold an international seminar in late March
or early April next year to commemorate the late Madame Chiang
Kai-shek.</P>
      <P>Madame Chiang, the glamorous, U.S.-educated Republic of China
first lady who helped her husband -- the late President Chiang
Kai-shek -- rule mainland China and later Taiwan during years of war,
upheaval and Cold War tension, died in her New York home Oct. 24
at the age of 106.</P>
      <P>According to the KMT's plan, the seminar will be held after the
next presidential election scheduled for March 20, 2004.</P>
      <P>The theme of the seminar will focus on the Chiangs' roles in
China's modernization, a KMT spokesman said. Chinese affairs experts
and scholars from home and abroad will be invited to present academic
papers for discussion at the planned symposium.</P>
      <P>The Chiangs were once one of the most famous couples in the world
-- a dashing general married to a beautiful, urbane woman. Time
magazine publisher Henry Luce named them the "Man and Woman of the
Year" in 1938.</P>
      <P>"The seminar will review the couple's different roles in China's
modernization," the KMT spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Chiang headed the KMT for decades until he died on April 5, 1975.
The spokesman said the period between late March and early April is
suitable for the holding of the planned seminar as Madame Chiang's
birth anniversary and the late president's death anniversary fall in
this period.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the KMT's party history and cultural affairs
departments will flesh out details regarding the planned seminar,
including the meeting agenda and the list of scholars to be invited.</P>
      <P>Madame Chiang led a reclusive life at her Manhattan home for much
of her later life after her husband's death. Born Soong Mei-ling,
Chiang became widely known in the West as a spokeswoman for Chinese
efforts to resist the Japanese forces that began invading China in
the 1930s.</P>
      <P>After the Chinese Communist Party took control of the mainland,
the Republic of China government, under her husband's leadership,
moved its seat to Taiwan in 1949. Chiang and his wife became Asia's
foremost anti-communist symbols.</P>
      <P>The KMT's women's affairs department will organize a memorial
service Friday in remembrance of Madame Chiang.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAIMED IRAQI BOY IN TAIWAN TO RECEIVE MEDICAL TREATMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A 12-year-old Iraqi boy who was maimed
during the U.S. bombing of Iraq arrived in Taipei late Monday to
receive medical treatment that may include being fitted with a
prosthetic foot and hand.</P>
      <P>Khaldon kh-Thiab, better known in his local community as Aldon,
lost his right hand and left foot as a result of a cluster bomb
explosion in the front courtyard of his family's home in April this
year, according to a spokesman for the Eden Social Welfare
Foundation, which has sponsored the Iraqi boy's trip to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Aldon was accompanied by his father to Taiwan. The youngster was
by no means camera shy when he was met by well-wishers and flashing
cameras upon his arrival at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport.</P>
      <P>The boy, who has moved around with the aid of a crutch over the
past six months, smiled from ear to ear when he was offered a
wheelchair donated by a private enterprise in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Aldon's father expressed appreciation for the warmth of the
Taiwan people shown toward him and his son, saying "thank you" in
mandarin Chinese.</P>
      <P>Aldon is scheduled to stay in Taiwan for two months to undergo
examinations and treatment, mainly at the Far Eastern Memorial
Hospital, the Eden spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Doctors at the Far Eastern Memorial Hospital are expected to
treat the boy's injuries before deciding on what kind of prosthesis
to provide for the boy.</P>
      <P>According to the Eden foundation, Khaldon kh-Thiab was playing
with two of his younger brothers in the courtyard of their house when
U.S. bombers swept across the skies of Fallujah, which is located
about 50 kilometers from Baghdad, one day in April.</P>
      <P>The boys fled into their house when the bombing started. They
waited inside for about one hour until the bombing stopped and then
ventured outside again. The boys began investigating an object that
looked like a cluster of balls that had landed in the courtyard. It
turned out to be unexploded ordnance. The subsequent detonation
killed the two younger boys instantly and maimed Aldon.</P>
      <P>Khaldon kh-Thiab's family has 28 children from three mothers.
Three of the children have been killed in the war, and only eight of
them have been able to attend school on their father's subsistence
wage equivalent to US$5 a month.</P>
      <P>Before the war, Aldon was a happy boy who liked to play football
and shoot the breeze. His greatest dream was to become a driver.</P>
      <P>The Eden Social Welfare Foundation, one of the major charitable
organizations in Taiwan, which has continued to help the poor and
needy at home and abroad, decided to sponsor Khaldon-Kh-Thiab's
Taiwan trip after receiving a report from the U.N. Children's Fund in
July.</P>
      <P>According to the UNICEF report, at the height of the U.S.-led war
against Iraq early this year, one of the major hospitals in Baghdad
reported admitting an average of about 100 injured people every hour.
During the first month of the war, the hospital was forced to
amputate the limbs of more than 100 children who had been injured by
bombings or shootings.</P>
      <P>The Hashemite Charitable Society for Soldiers with Special Needs
in Jordan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' liaison office in
Jordan have been largely instrumental in arranging Khaldon kh-Thiab's
trip to Taiwan, according to the Eden spokesman.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, RUSSIA CONCLUDE THIRD WTO BILATERAL CONSULTATION MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva, Oct. 28(CNA)
(By Neil Lu and P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and Russia on Tuesday concluded
their third bilateral consultation meeting related to Russia's bid to
join the World Trade Organization (WTO), with Taiwan gaining many
concessions from the former communist country.</P>
      <P>It has been learned that the bilateral consultations between the
two countries are close to the final stage and that Moscow has
already accepted most of Taiwan's requests on issues regarding tariff
cuts and service market access for most sectors, including the
computer service, publishing and printing service, audio-visual, and
air cargo service sectors.</P>
      <P>Although the two countries have not reached a final agreement,
much progress was made during the third meeting, sources close to the
bilateral consultations said.</P>
      <P>In the meeting, the Russian side also committed to opening up its
service market in the areas of telecommunications, financial items,
tourism, law services, education, taxation administration and
construction.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan expressed concerns about Russia's agricultural
products market access regime, particularly the "tariff quota" regime
that regulates meat imports. The island also expressed the hope that
Moscow could further open its market for certain Taiwan steel
products.</P>
      <P>In response, Russia promised that it will only apply the "tariff
quota" regime for agricultural products for a period of six years and
that it will review the regime after five years, adding that its
agricultural market will definitely be opened further.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan requested that Russia join the "Information
Technology Agreement" and also join the "Government Procurement
Agreement" as an observer.</P>
      <P>Two-way trade between Taiwan and Russia for 2002 amounted to
US$1.18 billion, with Taiwan experiencing a bilateral trade deficit
of US$670 million.</P>
      <P>The island's major export items to Russia are computers,
electronic products, machinery, textiles, plastic products and
automobile parts.</P>
      <P>Taiwan attaches great importance to its bilateral negotiations with
Russia and hopes to obtain better access to the Russian market for its
products and services, including information, telecommunications and
financial services.</P>

    <TEXT>The Manila Bulletin: House
adjourns abruptly.

The House of Representatives yesterday abruptly
declared an early adjournment of session and

The Philippine Daily Inquirer: Cojuangco solons

The impeachment issue worsened into what lawmakers
termed a constitutional crisis Tuesday, after the
Supreme Court (SC) "called" on Congress to "maintain
the status quo"--that is, to refrain from transmitting
the articles of impeachment against Chief Justice
Hilario Davide Jr. to the Senate for trial.

The Philippine Star: SC stops impeachment.

The Supreme Court issued yesterday a status quo
order that effectively stopped Congress from
continuing with the impeachment proceedings against
Chief Justice Hilario Davide Jr. until petitions
assailing its constitutionality are resolved.

The Manila Times: SC blocks impeach trial.

The Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered the House of
Representatives and the Senate to maintain a status

    <HEADLINE>FREED TAIWANESE FALUN GONG PRACTITIONER RECOUNTS ORDEAL IN SHANGHAI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese Falun Gong practitioner who had
been detained in Shanghai for 20 days before being allowed to return
home a day earlier said Wednesday that mainland China's "white
terror" threatens the security of innocent Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Lin Hsiao-kai, a member of the Taiwan Falun Dafa Association
(TFDA), said at a news conference that he left for Shanghai Sept. 30
to do some sightseeing and visit friends. But he was arrested by
mainland Chinese security authorities Oct. 7 for unknown reasons and
was not released until Oct. 27.</P>
      <P>On the first day of the detention, Lin recalled that he was
subjected to round-the-clock interrogations. "In the following days,
mainland security officers continued to interrogate me for seven to
eight hours a day."</P>
      <P>Lin said they wanted information about Taiwanese Falun Gong
practitioners and the TFDA's activities.</P>
      <P>"Mainland Chinese investigators warned me that they would hunt me
down in Taiwan if I revealed what was discussed during the
interrogations," Lin claimed, adding that his interrogators told him
that they would definitely be able to find him.</P>
      <P>Lin said he was shocked to find that his mainland interrogators
knew almost everything about his life and work in Taiwan. They had
information about his wife, friends and even had an e-mail address he
had canceled, he added.</P>
      <P>Falun Gong has been outlawed by mainland authorities, who
consider it to be a dangerous cult, but it is a legal social or
quasi-religious organization in Taiwan, where its followers number
more than 300,000.</P>
      <P>Lin's wife called a news conference last week to call for help to
push mainland authorities to release her husband as soon as possible.
Her appeal drew concern from lawmakers and human rights activists.</P>
      <P>Lin said he was lucky to be able to return home safely.
Nevertheless, Lin said he had been traumatized by the 20-day
detention in Shanghai. "It was a nightmare and has left me with
mental scars," he added.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, some 20 mainland China-born TFDA members have
been arrested by mainland authorities during visits to their mainland
hometowns. Most of them are wives of Taiwan citizens, Lin said,
adding that the ROC government should take active steps to urge
mainland China to stop persecute them.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 20 TFDA members began an islandwide bicycle journey
Wednesday to enhance public awareness of mainland China's suppression
of Falun Gong practitioners and to enlist public support for a
campaign to push Beijing authorities to release all detained TFDA
members.</P>
      <P>TFDA President Chang Ching-hsi said it seems to him that the
mainland authorities especially like to arrest female mainland-born
Falun Gong followers who have married Taiwan men.</P>
      <P>At least one of them has obtained Taiwan citizenship, but she is
still in jail on the mainland because she is a Falun Gong member,
Chang said.</P>
      <P>In another case, a mainland wife of a Taiwanese Falun Gong
follower was arrested in September 1998 when she returned to her
parents' home in Jinlin in northeastern China. After serving a
two-year prison term, she was released on parole, but the mainland
authorities still will not allow her to be reunited with her husband
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 20 TFDA members will cycle around the island to seek the
signatures of local people in support of their campaign.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's business turnover in August
totaled NT$758.5 billion (US$22.3 billion), the third month of growth
in a row, a spokesman for the Statistics Department under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) reported Wednesday.</P>

year-earlier level, according to the official.</P>
      <P>The retail sector contributed NT$228.5 billion in business volume
in August, up by 5.28 percentage points year-on-year. The growth was
mainly a result of the good sales of home appliances, jewelry,
cosmetics and cleaning products.</P>
      <P>The wholesale sector generated NT$505.1 billion in August
business turnover, a 5.85 percent rise from a year ago, thanks to
machinery equipment, automobile and accessories sales.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will pay his
respects to the late Madame Chiang Kai-shek after his arrival in New
York Oct. 31 for a two-day transit stop on his way to Panama for an
official visit, the Presidential Office announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen, heading a 100-member entourage, will leave Taipei Friday
via a chartered China Airline plane. This will be Chen's fourth
overseas tour since assuming office in May 2000.</P>
      <P>A Presidential Office spokesman said Chen will go to the Franklin
E. Campell funeral house to pay homage to Madame Chiang, the Republic
of China's most famous first lady, immediately after his arrival in
New York.</P>
      <P>Madame Chiang, who had helped her husband -- the late President
Chiang Kai-shek -- rule mainland China and later Taiwan during years
of war, upheaval and Cold War tensions, died at her Manhattan home
Oct. 24 at the age of 106.</P>
      <P>In the evening of that day, Chen will be honored with the
International League for Human Rights' (ILHR's) 2003 Human Rights

      <P>The ILHR Human Rights Award is being presented to President Chen

award.</P>

Taiwanese associations in the greater New York area.</P>
      <P>Chen will leave for Panama Nov. 2 to attend the Central American
country's Nov. 3 centennial celebrations. While there, Chen will also
exchange notes with Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso on a free
trade agreement signed by the two leaders in Taipei Aug. 21. He will
also hold talks with Moscoso on ways to further boost bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>On his way back to Taipei from Panama, Chen will make a transit
stop in Alaska at the invitation of Alaska Governor Frank H.
Murkowski, a staunch supporter of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen will exchange views with Murkowski on feasible measures to

    <HEADLINE>MIXED CONSCRIPTION, VOLUNTEER MILITARY SYSTEM TO BE ADOPTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday
that Taiwan will adopt a combined conscription and volunteer military
service system at some point in the future.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with 105 "model" retired
military servicemen. The outstanding veterans will be honored Friday
in connection with the celebration of Veterans Day, which falls on
Oct. 31.</P>
      <P>Chen said his administration plans to upgrade the current
Veterans Affairs Commission to the level of a ministry, allowing it
to offer better services and welfare benefits for retired servicemen.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he went on, the conscription-only military service
system for enlisted men will be transformed into a combined
conscription and volunteer service system that will better meet the
changing combat demands.</P>
      <P>"With the advances in defense technology and weaponry systems, we
need more well-trained career soldiers who are willing to serve for
longer than the period of time served by conscripts," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan began to accept volunteer enlistees this year on an
experimental basis. Chen said the ratio of volunteers will be raised
in accordance with the government's financial status and progress in
the military's restructuring plan.</P>
      <P>Under the existing regulations, Chen said, local male citizens
can be drafted for mandatory military service when they turn 18 years
old, even though they don't get voting rights until they are 20.</P>
      <P>"These provisions are unreasonable, " Chen said. "With the
prevalence of compulsory education and the upgrading of the knowledge
level of local citizens, the age of suffrage should be lowered to 18.
This is a general world trend. Nearly all advanced democratic
countries, including Britain, Germany, France, Switzerland, Holland
and the United States have lowered their age of suffrage to 18," Chen
noted.</P>
      <P>He added that this is partly the reason behind his
administration's decision to push for the formulation of a new
constitution that better fits Taiwan's present reality and facilitate
its political, social and economic reforms to upgrade overall
national competitiveness.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  29 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan approved Wednesday an
anti-terrorism draft bill, paving the way for the formation of a
Cabinet-level panel in charge of the fight against terrorism and
giving clear legal guidelines for punishments for those convicted of
terrorist acts.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the draft bill, anyone convicted of engaging
in terrorist activities could face the death sentence, life
imprisonment or a jail term of at least 10 years. Those who are
convicted of having taken part in terrorist organizations could be
sentenced to a minimum five-year jail term or punished with a fine of
up to NT$100 million (about US$2.95 million).</P>
      <P>The purpose of the draft bill is to set up a government agency
especially designed to handle such issues and to coordinate
cooperation and information exchanges among the relevant authorities,
both at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>Once the ad hoc group under the Executive Yuan has been set up,
the National Security Bureau will be required to report to it as and
when necessary about any individual or organization suspected of
involvement in terrorist acts.</P>
      <P>The draft bill also demands that operators of telecommunications
systems be equipped with recording facilities that can allow them to
track information and crack down on cross-boarder crimes on the
Internet.</P>
      <P>Police authorities will be given the power to take suspects into
custody without charge for no more than 24 hours, while the Coast
Guard Administration, the Investigation Bureau and the National
Police Administration will be authorized to freeze or sequester
property and real-estate holdings allegedly used by suspects in
terrorist activities.</P>
      <P>The bill will have to be approved by the Legislative Yuan before
it can be promulgated.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXECUTIVE YUAN PASSES DRAFT REFERENDUM LAW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  29  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan passed a draft
referendum law Wednesday despite opposition from Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou, who speculated that it might undermine the
checks-and-balances mechanism between the executive and legislative
branches.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan passed the draft law in a floor meeting in the
wake of criticism by the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First
Party (PFP) that the issue of referendum was promoted to the public
extremely heavily before the Executive Yuan even had a draft law to
present to the Legislative Yuan, a contradiction to normal practice
in which the draft law is presented before promotion to the public
takes place.</P>
      <P>The draft referendum law will immediately send to the Legislative
Yuan for review.</P>
      <P>According to Premier Yu Shyi-kun, the version truly upholds the
democratic values of referendum, which he said aims to protect the
basic human right of citizens to take part in politics, so that the
people can be the true masters of the nation.</P>
      <P>The draft referendum law "sets no restrictions on the issues to
be put to referendum, provides multilateral channels to initiate
referendum, sets a reasonably appropriate threshold for the number of
signatures collected and sets no unnecessary restrictions on the
timing of referendum, " the premier said, adding that it will "uphold
the democratic values" of referendum and conform with the spirit of
the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The premier expressed the hope that the Legislative Yuan will
start rational debate and consultation so as to complete the
legislation in the shortest possible time.</P>
      <P>Ma, a member of the KMT, spoke twice to raise questions about the
draft law.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Executive Yuan sent a draft initiative and
referendum law to the Legislative Yuan in April 2002, but withdrew it
in October the same year.</P>
      <P>Ma said that he had three questions concerning what he claimed
was the hastily worked out draft referendum law.</P>
      <P>He said the first article of the draft law does not list the
legal basis of the law according to the Constitution. In addition,
the Constitution stipulates that the initiative and referendum rights
should be stipulated by law. The draft law also has to be defined by
law, but it does not include such wording, he said.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the draft law allows the people to collect
signatures to initiate a referendum, while the government can also
conduct referendums on policy issues, which he said could create
problems.</P>
      <P>He said that if a bill sent by the Executive Yuan fails to clear
the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan can resort the issue to a
referendum, which will affect the checks-and-balances mechanism
between the legislative and executive branches.</P>
      <P>The mayor noted that Interior Minister Yu Cheng-hsien said in the
floor meeting that governments in Europe can initiate referendums,
but he noted that their rights are stipulated in their constitutions.</P>
      <P>Ma said that if the government has the right to initiate a
referendum, then it must be stipulated in the Constitution and not
just in the form of a law.</P>
      <P>Ma also said that Minister Without Portfolio Chen Chi-nan said in
the floor meeting that various villages and townships islandwide are
already conducting "referendums, " but the Cabinet's version of the
draft referendum law contains no related regulations and addresses
only regulations governing referendums in municipalities, counties
and cities.</P>
      <P>This means that administrative units below the district level in
Taipei cannot initiate referendums, while the smaller villages and
townships can, Ma pointed out, adding that this is a question to
which the Ministry of the Interior has failed to respond.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP unveiled its
version of a draft referendum law last week that rules out the
possibility of the government initiating referendums and excludes
issues concerning the national flag, the nation's name and national
territory from being put to a referendum.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,   Oct.  29  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The law enforcement authorities
restarted an all-out search Wednesday in an attempt to track down the
fugitive former speaker of the Kaohsiung city council, who has been
missing since fleeing in mid-October to avoid serving a jail term.</P>
      <P>The renewed search was called for following a Beijing official's
claim earlier the same day that Chu An-hsiung is not hiding in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Zhang Mingqing, a spokesman for Beijing's Central Office for
Taiwan Affairs, rebutted rumors at a regular press conference that
Chu is in hiding on the mainland.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) under the National Police
Administration has been in contact with the mainland authorities to
verify reports that Chu is in Zhuhai City, in the southern mainland
province of Guangdong.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung District Prosecutor's Office issued an all-points
bulletin for Chu Oct. 20 after he failed to turn himself in that day
in accordance with an arrest warrant issued Oct. 17.</P>
      <P>Chu, who should by now have started serving a 22-month jail term
for vote-buying in the election for city councilman in Kaohsiung late
last year, failed to report to court to begin serving his term,
prompting the Kaohsiung prosecutors to issue the APB. Chu has also
been charged with involvement in vote-buying for election for city
council speakership.</P>
      <P>His wife, former legislator Wu Teh-mei, said Oct. 23 that she was
"put at ease" after receiving a "reliable" call the previous night
informing her that her husband was on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Wu held a press conference last week in which she claimed that
the government was imposing what she called "green terror" on Chu by
dealing with his criminal activities "selectively" for political
purposes.</P>
      <P>Wu also claimed at the press conference that she has not been in
touch with her husband and does not know his whereabouts.</P>
      <P>Chu's whereabouts remained unknown as of noon Wednesday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA WARY OF AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY EXODUS DUE TO EASED RULES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In reaction to changes made to a key law
regulating exchanges between the people on the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait, the Council of Agriculture (COA) has proposed banning
domestic agricultural personnel from working with key Taiwan
technology at institutional agencies in mainland China.</P>
      <P>In a report submitted to the economic and energy committee under
the Legislative Yuan following the amendments to the Statute
Governing the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the
Mainland Area, the COA proposed a set of measures to curb the
negative impact of the opening up of the domestic agricultural
sector, including a ban on the export of key agricultural technology
to the mainland.</P>
      <P>The COA suggested prohibiting Taiwan professionals with key
technology and sensitive knowledge from taking any posts at
mainland-based institutions in order to secure Taiwan's agricultural
progress and competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Regarding visits by mainland agricultural professionals to
Taiwan, the COA has also put responding measures in place to rule out
such visits in sensitive fields in an effort to ward off a leak of
critical information, an official said.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the COA is in favor of maintaining the existing
controls on agricultural and farm imports from the mainland by
publishing items permitted for import in a gradual manner and by
banning mainland-bound Taiwan investment in areas in which Taiwan
still enjoys the upper hand, the official added.</P>
      <P>In addition, he pointed out that Taiwan's customs, quarantine and
immigration scrutiny must be stepped up to wipe out smuggling and the
spread of infections from the mainland should direct transport links
be set up between the two sides, especially in view of the fact that
the mainland remains an epidemic area for many animal and plant
diseases.</P>
      <P>One of the revisions to the statute approved in early October by
the legislature allows the establishment of direct cross-strait
transport, while issues related to the opening of professional
exchanges will also have a profound impact on Taiwan's agriculture,
the official said.</P>
      <P>Direct cross-strait transport services will effectively shorten
the travel time for agricultural and farm products between the two
sides and could worsen Taiwan's unemployment, he claimed.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 29 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Relations between Taiwan and Mongolia have
become increasingly close, with bilateral exchanges growing
remarkably in recent years, President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen said that since 1991 -- when Taiwan first began promoting
civic relations with Mongolia, bilateral ties between the two sides
have grown by leaps and bounds, particularly since 1997, when Taipei
City and the Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator established sisterhood
ties.</P>
      <P>In addition to facilitating the knotting of sisterhood ties, Chen
noted that he, as mayor of Taipei at that time, also traveled to
Mongolia in 1999 to further cement bilateral exchanges. Chen made the
remarks during an audience with a group of Mongolian officials and
civic leaders who have been in Taipei for a one-month training
workshop.</P>
      <P>The frequent bilateral exchanges have also been evidenced by the
establishment of a Taiwan trade center by the China External Trade
Development Council (CETRA) -- Taiwan's major foreign trade promotion
arm -- the setting up of a Taipei Economic and Cultural
Representative Office in Ulan Bator by the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs in 2002, and the ensuing founding of the Mongolian Economic
and Cultural Office in Taipei this year, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen told his Mongolian guests that he was much impressed with
the warmth with which the Mongolian people greeted him, as well as
their vigor and enthusiasm.</P>
      <P>The president offered his greetings to the 26 Mongolian officials
-- most of them incumbent deputy governors from various provinces
around Mongolia -- who have just completed a one-month civil servant
and public-office manager training program sponsored by the
Cabinet-level Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission.</P>
      <P>Chen exhorted them to continue to play important and crucial
roles in the efforts to further strengthen ties between Taiwan and
Mongolia after they return to their country.</P>
      <P>Members of the Mongolian official group, led by Sodnom Batmunkh,
a senior consultant to the Mongolian national legislature -- known as
the State Great Khural -- paid a courtesy call on Chen at the
Presidential Office, accompanied by Hsu Chih-hsiung, Chairman of the
Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND MUM ON REPORTS ABOUT MEDIUM-RANGE MISSILE TEST-FIRING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
declined to make any comments Wednesday on media reports that the
Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology (CIST) has test-fired a
newly developed medium-range surface-to-surface missile.</P>
      <P>According to the media reports, the CIST -- the military's
research arm -- conducted the first-ever test-firing of its newly
developed ballistic missile with a range of 600 kilometers to 900
kilometers at the maximum-guarded Chiupeng military base in the
southernmost county of Pingtung Sept. 25.</P>
      <P>The reports said the CIST-developed missile is capable of hitting
targets in Hong Kong, Shanghai and other major southeastern mainland
coastal cities.</P>
      <P>In response to press inquiries about the reports, the MND said it
is the military's established policy to refrain from making any
comments or giving any briefings on the nation's weaponry development
and procurement.</P>
      <P>The MND further said the CIST's defense technology development
plan is based on the nation's ultimate military buildup goal of
establishing an elite deterrent force to safeguard national security.</P>
      <P>While the military is stepping up combat preparedness in the face
of mainland China's mounting missile threat, the MND said, Taiwan
will never provoke a war in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The MND said the CIST's research and development projects are
mainly aimed at satisfying the armed forces' combat demands and at
beefing up the nation's overall defense capabilities.</P>

    <DATELINE>New York, Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Eric Tseng and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Pastor Chou Lien-hua said Tuesday that he
will give a requiem service for the late Madame Chiang Kai-shek to be
held at a church in Manhattan Nov. 5.</P>
      <P>Madame Chiang, who had led a peaceful, reclusive life in New York
for much of her later life after her husband, the late Republic of
China President Chiang Kai-shek -- died in 1975, passed away in her
sleep at her Manhattan residence Oct. 23 at the age of 106.</P>
      <P>The Nov. 5 service will be conducted in Chinese and English, with
some 1,000 people expected to attend, said Chou, who was the "court
minister" for the Chiang family for 40 years until about a decade
ago.</P>
      <P>Chou, who was the minister of the Kai-ke Church in the Chiang
residence complex in Taipei between 1954 and 1994, is the chairman of
World Vision Taiwan and co-founder of Taiwan's Eden Social Welfare
Foundation.</P>
      <P>Chiang Fang Chih-yi, granddaughter-in-law of Madame Chiang, said
Tuesday that after discussions over the preceding several days,
members of the Chiang family decided that Madame Chiang's body should
be placed temporarily in a mausoleum in New York until she could be
buried with her husband -- Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek.</P>
      <P>Born Soong Mayling, Madame Chiang became widely known in the
West, using her Western-education background to lobby for China
during its fight against the Japanese in the 1940s.</P>
      <P>After the Chinese Communist Party took control of the mainland,
the ROC government, under her husband's leadership, moved its seat to
Taiwan in 1949. Chiang and his U.S.-educated wife became Asia's
foremost anti-communist symbols.</P>
      <P>Madame Chiang is also remembered for her dedication to women's
rights and charity work throughout her life.</P>

application from Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. -- the
second-largest banking group in Japan and the world -- to upgrade its

Mencius' lesson of the day: "When a ruler regards his ministers
as his hands and feet, they regard him as their belly and heart; when
he regards them as dogs and horses, they regard him as a common
citizen; when he regards them as dirt and grass, they regard him as a
robber and enemy."</TEXT>

      <P>Singapore Airlines (SIA)
returned to profit in the September quarter after the Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) forced the airline into its
first-ever loss in the previous three months.</P>
      <P>SIA suffered an unprecedented first-quarter net loss of
S$312 million as SARS hammered travel demand.</P>
      <P>Revenue in the second quarter fell to S$2.5 billion from
S$2.7 billion in the previous year, but was sharply higher
than the S$1.65 billion in the first quarter.</P>
      <P>SIA reported a net profit of S$306 million (US$174 million) for
its second quarter, citing a rebound in traffic and cost
cuts.</P>
      <P>But for the first half, SIA lost S$6.5 million from a S$773.5
million profit on the year.</P>
      <P>The SARS outbreak dealt a heavy blow to Asian carriers
such as Cathay Pacific Airways and SIA, forcing them to
suspend flights, trim costs and to offer heavily discounted
air fares to entice people to travel.</P>
      <P> SIA cut wages, slashed capacity by a third, and axed nearly
600 staff - the largest lay-offs in its 56-year history.</P>
      <P> But along with other Asian carriers, it is seeing travel
demand return and has restored flights back to pre-SARS
levels.</P>
      <P> Separately, two listed SIA units also reported second quarter
earnings.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEFENSE MINISTRY REBUTS U.S. NEWSPAPER COMMENTARY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  30 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
rebutted Thursday a commentary in a major U.S. daily and stressed the
armed forces' determination to defend Taiwan and the long way the
ministry has come in converting itself into a civilian-led
organization.</P>
      <P>In a written response to criticism carried by the Washington
Post, the ministry said there is no question whatsoever about the
armed forces' determination to protect the country in the face of
increasing military threat from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Noting that Beijing has never renounced the threat of force
against Taiwan and is targeting the island with some 500 missiles, a
number that is increasing at a rate of 75 per year, the ministry
said the armed forces have never relaxed their guard against any
possible invasion by mainland forces.</P>
      <P>Citing a survey conducted by the Foundation on International and
Cross-Strait Studies in 2002, the ministry said 75.1 percent of the
people interviewed in that survey said they were willing to fight for
Taiwan should the country be attacked by the People's Republic of
China.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the ministry quoted President Chen Shui-bian as
saying that its is completely wrong to think that "we do not have to
protect the nation as the United States will come to our rescue."</P>
      <P>Based on the general public's strong willingness to protect their
country, the government has not dragged its feet in raising funds to
procure weapons, as some critics have claimed, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>The MND has aggressively prepared budgets for weapons and
equipment approved for sale by the United States to Taiwan in 2001,
such as Kidd-class destroyers and new amphibious vehicles that were
budgeted for fiscal 2003, as well as long-range early warning radar
budgeted for 2004, while PAC-3 missile systems and new submarines are
listed in a special budget.</P>
      <P>As a democracy, the ministry's statement went on, the procurement
of military weapons and equipment is subject to the supervision of
the legislature.</P>
      <P>The ministry also said it has quickened its pace of reorganizing
the military to establish an elite and modern force, including
putting the ministry itself under the charge of a civilian leader.</P>
      <P>As of Oct. 1, 143 civilian officials had been recruited, about 70
percent of the required quota of 204 in the preliminary stage. In
fact, the ministry claimed it has done within a few years what it has
taken the United States several decades to do after the passage of
the 1989 Goldwater-Nichols Act, which mandated similar reforms of the
U.S. Department of Defense.</P>
      <P>The Washington Post questioned Taiwan's resolve to protect
itself, in the signed commentary titled "U.S. Hits Obstacles in
Helping Taiwan Guard against Mainland China."</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Eyeing Taiwan's abundant hi-tech manpower
and its market deployment abilities, the United States-based National
Semiconductor Corp. (NSC) has decided to set up a research and
development (R&amp;D) center in Taiwan, an NSC executive said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Wen-hsiung, NSC Taiwan general manager, told CNA that the
NSC headquarters have been working on the plan for six months and
will officially make the announcement after relevant arrangements and
preparations have been completed.</P>
      <P>According to Hsiao, Taiwan's strength in information technology,
its rich resources in hi-tech manpower and its market exploration
abilities are the major reasons behind his company's decision to
establish a research hub here. He said that the NSC has already sent
foreign engineers to Taiwan, who are now stationed in northern
Hsinchu City -- a stronghold of Taiwan's hi-tech industries.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., the world's largest
chip maker, is also a prime contractor for the NSC. Its clients based
in Taiwan include prominent companies such as BenQ and Compal.</P>
      <P>The NSC's Taiwan hub plan will bring to 14 the number of
foreign-based world-class companies to set up here, such as

    <HEADLINE>WEF RANKS TAIWAN FIFTH IN TERMS OF COMPETITIVENESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Oct.  30 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has been ranked the fifth most
competitive economy in the world in the latest Global Competitiveness
Report released here by the World Economic Forum (WEF) Thursday.</P>
      <P>In the forum's 2003-2004 report, Finland topped the list as the
most competitive state in the world, replacing the United States,
which moved down one spot to second place.</P>
      <P>Following close behind them in descending order were Sweden,
Denmark, Taiwan, Singapore, Switzerland, Iceland and Norway.</P>
      <P>European states feature prominently on the list, accounting for
six out of the top ten.</P>
      <P>Finland took the top spot because of its marvelous performance in
all economic fields. The United States' competitiveness was blunted
by a regression in its overall economic situation and infrastructure,
despite its dominance in science and technology.</P>
      <P>Taiwan leads the Asian states on the list, with Singapore taking
sixth place, Japan in 11th place and South Korea in 18th place.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's high ranking comes mainly from its highly developed
hi-tech industry, while Singapore owes its competitiveness to its
overall favorable economic environment and healthy government system.</P>
      <P>Mainland China, which has seen its economy grow rapidly in recent
years, moves down from 22nd place last year to 44th this year, mainly
because of its deteriorating administrative system and government
corruption.</P>
      <P>The World Economic Forum has been authoring the global
competitiveness report since 1979. The latest report rates the
competitiveness of 102 countries, compared to 80 countries rated last
year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's relatively high placement on the list gives the
government, which is struggling to boost the country's economy, a
much-needed shot in the arm.</P>
      <P>Lin Chia-lung, a spokesman for the country's Executive Yuan, said
in Taipei that the government shares the credit for the ranking,
adding that it proves the government's economy-promotion measures
have gradually taken effect and that the general public should have
confidence in the government's policies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CEPD OFFICIAL WARNS OF INVESTMENT RISKS IN MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  30 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although mainland China now is the focal
point of investors from across the world, Taiwan businesses should
try to reduce their investment risks there by shifting operations to
other locations, a government official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chiu Hsiu-chin, a section chief at the Economic Research
Department under the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD), made the remarks after the World Economic Forum (WEF) issued
its Global Competitiveness Report 2003-2004, in which the rating of
the mainland's competitiveness was shown to have dropped to 44th in
the world from 33rd last year.</P>
      <P>The WEF made the change citing such reasons as corruption and
inferior infrastructure in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan ranked at the world's 5th spot but was the most
competitive country in Asia, according to the same survey. Taiwan
also enjoyed an upper hand in all major categories against the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the mainland has emerged as a world economic power
in the wake of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis and its entry into the
World Trade Organization in 2000, Chiu said international
enterprises, including those from Europe, Japan and the United States
have been cashing in on the mainland market.</P>
      <P>However, Chiu pointed out that Taiwan businesses' trade reliance
on the mainland market is the world's third-highest, trailing only
Hong Kong and Singapore. She acknowledged that the 33 percent ratio
will not decrease in the short term because of Taiwan's cultural,
language and geographic links with mainland China.</P>
      <P>She urged Taiwan businesses to cautiously weigh the possible high
investment risks in mainland China given the fact that many
uncertainties remain there as a result of the lack of rule of law and
order.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the government's "go south" policy is aimed at
encouraging Taiwan businessmen to invest in Southeast Asian nations
against such a backdrop, she said the government has been sparing no
efforts to improve the domestic investment climate and upgrade
Taiwan's industrial levels to convince local businesses to keep their
roots at home.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VETERANS COMMISSION TO TIGHTEN CROSS-STRAIT MARRIAGE SCREENING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Veterans Affairs Commission (VAC) said
Thursday that it will tighten its screening of applications by
retired servicemen to have their mainland Chinese spouses or
relatives come to Taiwan to live with them.</P>
      <P>VAC Chairman Teng Chu-lin made the remarks at a meeting of the
Legislative Yuan's Defense Committee.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Huang
Chien-ting expressed concern about reports that three elderly retired
servicemen were given suspended jail sentences for trying to pass
themselves off as the grandfathers of three mainland Chinese men who
entered Taiwan and then disappeared.</P>
      <P>In response, Teng expressed regret over the incident. As a matter
of fact, he went on, the VAC has consistently made strenuous efforts
to improve welfare services for retired servicemen, particularly
elderly ones.</P>
      <P>Teng acknowledged that veterans account for 10 percent of the ROC
citizens who have married mainland women. He said the VAC has ordered
its veteran service centers around the island to strengthen the
services they offer to elderly retired servicemen with mainland-born
wives.</P>
      <P>"We'll assist them in overcoming difficulties in their married
lives and prevent them from being tricked into committing crimes, "
Teng said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he added, the VAC will cooperate with the Bureau of
Immigration and the Mainland Affairs Council to verify marriages
between veterans and mainland women to prevent mainland people from
entering Taiwan through bogus marriages.</P>
      <P>The VAC will also exercise prudence in checking applications by
veterans to have their mainland next of kin to come to Taiwan to
visit or live, he added.</P>
      <P>According to judicial sources, a mainland man known as Xie
Xiaoxing, who came to Taiwan a few years ago through marriage with a
local woman, offered money to entice the three veterans into saying
that they were the three mainland men's maternal grandfathers.</P>
      <P>The three mainland men then applied to come to Taiwan to visit
their "grandfathers." The trio went missing shortly after their
arrival in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors indicted Xie and the three veterans, identified as
Wang Ping-chuan, Wang Chi and Wang Chung-chu, on charges of document
forgery and the Taipei District Court sentenced Xie to one year and
10 months in prison.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang Ping-chuan was given a six-month jail term with a
four-year suspension. The two other veterans were each given a
four-month jail term with a two-year suspension. The jail terms can
be converted into fines.</P>
      <P>The court ruled that the defendants' actions threatened Taiwan's
security and public order by creating a way for mainland people to
enter Taiwan illegally.</P>
      <P>The penalties were designed to be harsh, but the court said that
because all the defendants repented, they were treated leniently.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA CHAIRMAN TOURS TAINAN TO INSPECT AQUACULTURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of the Council of Agriculture
(COA) traveled to Tainan in southern Taiwan Thursday to inspect
aquaculture farms and their management.</P>
      <P>COA Chairman Lee Chin-lung's trip is part of the COA's efforts to
boost consumers' confidence regarding the safety of fishery products
after a recent incident where the European Union rejected 30 tons of
Taiwan fishery products exported between August and October because
they allegedly contained higher-than-allowed chemical residues such
as chloramphemicol and furazolidone, which are used in the treatment
of infections caused by bacteria.</P>
      <P>Lee, accompanied by Hu Shin-hwa, director of the COA's Fisheries
Administration and Legislator Tang Pi-er of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, went to the Chungteh Market first to speak with
fishmongers.</P>
      <P>Lee was happy to hear that sales had not been affected by the
recent incident.</P>
      <P>Lee then tasted a bowl of milkfish soup, a famous delicacy in
Tainan, at the market, hoping to assuage any possible misgivings of
consumers.</P>
      <P>Lee then went to an aquaculture farm to learn about the
cultivation and management of milkfish, and whether operators had
used prohibited drugs in raising the fish. He said that he was
satisfied with what he saw during his inspection.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the COA will step up its inspection of fishery
products. He added that to ensure the safety of fishery products and
protect the rights of aquaculture operators, the government will help
them conduct tests before transporting their products to market.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will adhere to EU standards in inspecting the chemical
residues in aquaculture products. In the past the maximum
chloramphemicol and furazolidone residue was set at 0.3 parts per
billion. In the future, the island will comply with the EU's standard
of no more than 0.1 part per billion, a COA official said recently.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWO COMMON DRUGS CAN STEM REPLICATION OF SARS VIRUS: HEALTH DEPARTMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two well-established drugs -- promazine and
niclosamide -- can effectively keep the severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) pathogen from replicating, the National Health
Research Institute (NHRI) under the Department of Health (DOH)
announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chao Yu-sheng, an NHRI biotechnology division chief, said at an
international seminar on prevention and control of SARS outbreaks
being held in Taipei that the two drugs can kill all SARS viruses in
one day outside the human body in laboratory experiments.</P>
      <P>Promazine is a common drug used to treat depression, while
niclosamide is an anti-parasite drug whose patent rights have already
expired, Chao said.</P>
      <P>The new NHRI findings are encouraging, Chao said, adding that
both of the two drugs are very cheap.</P>
      <P>Chao said the NHRI has filed an application with the U.S. patent
office for using these two drugs to treat SARS patients.</P>
      <P>Su Yi-jen, director of the DOH's Center for Disease Control, said
it needs clinical tests on humans to determine the effectiveness of
the two drugs in treating SARS.</P>
      <P>But Su said the two drugs can at first be used to treat
critically ill SARS patients.</P>
      <P>NHRI researchers said the timing for using these two drugs may
need further discussion with clinicians. Use of the two drugs to
treat SARS patients will need the DOH's approval.</P>
      <P>The SARS pathogen is thought to be the coronavirus.</P>
      <P>NHRI researchers tested 700 existing drugs on coronaviruses
collected from pigs, which are closely similar to the coronaviruses
found in humans.</P>
      <P>The researchers discovered only 40 of the drugs had a response.
After further screening and testing, they finally found that
promazine and niclosamide can stem the replication of the SARS
virus.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DRAFT LAW PASSES FIRST READING FOR UNDERCOVER INVESTIGATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Judicial Committee of the Legislative
Yuan on Thursday passed a draft law to provide a legal basis for
investigation by undercover law enforcement agents.</P>
      <P>Under the draft law, if undercover policemen, in order to obtain
the trust of alleged criminals, carry or transport firearms or
prohibited drugs with the prior approval of the State Public
Prosecutor General, they will later be absolved of any crimes.</P>
      <P>The draft undercover personnel law passed the first reading amid
a recent controversy surrounding a policemen who is facing charges
for using drugs taken from a suspect and, instead of turning them in,
giving them over to an informant as payment for information.</P>
      <P>The draft law states that undercover work can only be used when
the nature of the situation endangers national security or is a major
disturbance of social order, and when there is no alternative
method of collecting evidence. The potential crime must also carry a
minimum five-year prison term.</P>
      <P>However, the criminal activities of undercover police must not
kill others or violate the major interests of the nation, according
to the draft law.</P>
      <P>To protect the safety of the undercover policemen, those who
divulge the identities of those involved in such work will be subject
to prison terms between one and seven years, and if such a revelation
leads to the death of an undercover policeman, the person will be
subject to a prison term of between three years and 10 years.</P>
      <P>Some legislators also suggested that military servicemen be
included in the draft law to help fully probe scandals in the
military, but since the National Defense Ministry was adamant that
military servicemen would not be appropriate to serve in undercover
tasks, the committee decided to keep that issue for later
consultations in the second reading of the draft law.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China (ROC) is an
independent state and has the determination to decide its own future,
facts that will never change because of any pressure from Beijing,
ROC Premier Yu Shyi-kun wrote in a message read to a group of
overseas Chinese leaders in Texas.</P>
      <P>In his written message to the world conference of the Global
Alliance for Democracy and Peace, which opened in Houston Friday and
will run for three days, the premier said Beijing's peremptory
approach toward Taiwan is unacceptable to both the people of Taiwan
and overseas Chinese, and is the root cause for the tension between
the mainland and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ROC has always tried to develop ties with Beijing
pragmatically but the People's Republic of China has never
acknowledged the ROC's statehood. Beijing has gone out of its way to
shut the ROC out of the international community by short circuiting
Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Organization, and by using
arm-twisting tactics on other countries to try to persuade them to
boycott the new ROC passport which bears the word "Taiwan." These
actions betray Beijing's arbitrariness, Yu said in his message.</P>
      <P>No matter what pressure Beijing uses against it, the ROC will not
be deterred from pursuing democracy, freedom and from claiming that
it is a state with sovereignty, yu said.</P>
      <P>He urged overseas Chinese to affirm the ROC's achievements in
developing its democracy and economy, and appealed to them to support
the ROC's efforts to defend the wellbeing and interests of Taiwan's
23 million people and its attempts to break the diplomatic blockades
imposed by Beijing.</P>
      <P>Calling overseas Chinese a valuable political asset of his
country, Yu urged them to work hand in hand with Taiwan to help
freedom and democracy take root.

    <HEADLINE>DOMESTIC BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY BOTTLENECKED DESPITE RECENT GROWTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although Taiwan's biotechnology industry
has made considerable progress in recent years, it still faces
various key bottlenecks in sustainable development, an industry
source said Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin Lung-tsan, project planning manager at the Industrial
Economics and Knowledge Center (IEK) under the Industrial Technology
Research Institute, pointed to the small scale of the domestic
industry and a lack of adequate information about the latest trends
in the world market as the reasons.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the output value of the domestic
biotechnology industry grew by 15 percent to NT$113.25 billion
(US$3.33 billion) in 2002, it accounted for only 0.5 percent of
global production value, Lin said.</P>
      <P>During the period from 1997 to Feb. 2002, a total of 108
biotechnology companies were opened in Taiwan in a broad range of
areas, from medical and agriculture industries to health foods and
environmental protection sectors.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, government authorities pumped NT$37.5 billion
into life science-related research during the 2000-2002 period, and
the figure is expected to increase by 27.9 percent to NT$48 billion
for the period from 2003 to 2005.</P>
      <P>However, he said that Taiwan's small enterprises and limited
resources for collecting capital and recruiting manpower has made it
difficult for the domestic industry to gain a bigger slice of the
huge international market. For instance, the United States spent more
than US$1 trillion in medical care treatment in 2001, he noted.</P>
      <P>In addition to the medical and health care fields, he said that
biotechnology can be applied in a wide range of sectors, including
agriculture, food, environmental protection, energy and chemicals to
manufacture a great variety of products.</P>
      <P>As the life cycle of life science-related goods is longer, the
more the production technology and facilities can be applied, the
cheaper the costs will become, he explained.</P>
      <P>In the face of Taiwan's limited capital resources and small-sized
businesses, he suggested companies, from downstream to upstream, set
up comprehensive joint ventures among them to counter foreign
competition.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 31 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan
backed down in a standoff with the Executive Yuan Friday by
reluctantly assigning the government's overall budget plan to various
committees for review.</P>
      <P>However, the legislature in the same breath resolved to ask the
country's supreme watchdog, the Control Yuan, to look into what it
called the "failure of duty" by Liu San-chih, chief of the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and Lin
Chia-lung, spokesman for the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Liu was referred to the Control Yuan for investigation because he
is budget chief of the Executive Yuan, while Lin was referred because
he criticized the Legislative Yuan on the premier's behalf and,
therefore, became a lightening rod in the quarrel.</P>
      <P>The budget plan proposed by the Executive Yuan in August was
dismissed by opposition lawmakers as "not consistent with the law" in
many places. They voted to ask the Executive Yuan to take it back and
revise it before Oct. 20.</P>
      <P>The request was rejected by Premier Yu Shyi-kun, who said the
budget was prepared according to the law and normal practice.</P>
      <P>In a news conference Thursday night, the premier tried to bring
the public opinion to bear on the legislature, urging opposition
lawmakers to subordinate their partisan bickering to the interests of
the nation and do their part dutifully under the law.</P>
      <P>As the law requires the legislature to finishing the review of
the budget by the end of November, opposition lawmakers were forced
to eat crow Friday and began the budget-review process.</P>
      <P>This latest twist has only drawn more fire from the Executive
Yuan with its spokesman saying at a news conference that the
legislative Yuan is contradicting itself by calling the budget
illegal in the first place only to began reviewing it later.</P>
      <P>Lin took in stride the legislature's resolution to refer him and
Liu to the Control Yuan, saying it is a politically motivated move
and the legislature has abused its power in making it.</P>
      <P>He said the Executive Yuan anticipates and is prepared for more
partisan quarrels at the Legislative Yuan in the run-up to the
presidential election in March.</P>

480,000 criminal cases reported every year in Taiwan, an average of
more than 1,300 cases per day. Larceny accounts for the largest
proportion at 70 percent, he added.</P>
      <P>He said that larceny induces fear among the public and the
National Police Administration should focus on cutting the number of
larceny crimes so that the public can be free from fear.</P>
      <P>Hsu noted that 378,939 criminal cases were reported in the first
nine months of this year, down 1.61 percent from the previous year,
although the rate of case-solving is up 1.42 percent.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, Taiwan's crime rate compared with other
countries was 2,196 cases per 100,000 people, which is the
sixth-lowest behind Turkey, Singapore, Argentina, Chile and Bulgaria.
In terms of crime-solving rates, Taiwan is the third-highest at 55.25
percent, only lower than Turkey and South Africa. He did not cite the
sources for the figures he offered.</P>
      <P>He claimed that this shows that social order in Taiwan is good
and that the law enforcement authorities should be recognized.
However, he admitted that since a great majority of the people do not
agree with this viewpoint, there is still ample room for improvement.</P>
      <P>Central Police University President Tsai Teh-huei agreed that the
recidivism rate among inmates was too high. He said this "has led to
awaste of national resources" and that the government needs to
address the overall importance of correctional institutions.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is willing to hold dialogues and

exchanges, President Chen Shui-bian said in a written message to a
conference of the Global Alliance for Democracy and Peace in Houston.</P>
      <P>In the message, President Chen said however that Taiwan will not

      <P>Taiwan will continue to actively participate in international

cooperation in economic activities, he said.</P>
      <P>He said Beijing is still sticking to such rhetoric as "One
China," and "One Country, Two Systems." and trying its best to isolate
Taiwan in the international arena. It has even repeatedly obstructed
Taiwan's efforts to join the World Health Organization. By doing so,
Beijing has badly hurt the feeling of Taiwan people, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONSERVATIONISTS WATCHING BLACK-FACED SPOONBILL ARRIVALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Conservationists said Friday that the
number of black-faced spoonbills arriving at their major wintering
habitat in Tainan County, southern Taiwan, has been less than last
year's arrivals and they are watching closely to see how many arrive
next month.</P>
      <P>In view of the botulism poisoning that caused a die-off among the
endangered birds at the end of last year and early this year, the
conservationists said that if the number of arrivals in November does
not match that of last year, they will have to assume that the
poisoning has affected the birds' population level.</P>
      <P>Bird watchers reported that they had counted 307 black-faced
spoonbills at the Chiku wetland sanctuary near the estuary of the
Tsengwen River in Tainan County as of Friday. The figure is nearly 20
percent lower than the 372 recorded as of Oct. 29, 2002.</P>
      <P>Conservationists said that the number of arrivals usually peaks
in November. Last year, more than 700 arrived in that month, setting
a record high. However, since Dec. 9, the birds began to die from
botulism poisoning, eventually causing the death of 73 birds, or 10
percent of the arrivals, despite all-out efforts to save them.</P>
      <P>The conservationists said that the reproduction rate of
black-faced spoonbills is between 8 percent and 12 percent per year,
and that extrapolating from the deaths and the reproduction rate, the
maximum number of arrivals this year should be maintained at around
700.</P>
      <P>If the number is less than 700, then the conclusion must be that
the poisoning has caused an effect on overall numbers, they added.</P>
      <P>To avoid any repetition of last year's poisoning, the Tainan
County Livestock Disease Control Center has since June been
monitoring the Chiku wetlands and has so far found five sites that
have tested positive for the botulin bacteria.</P>
      <P>Center officials have stepped up the removal of dead fish, shrimp
and other shellfish from infected sites and are turning the soil
regularly to let the sun kill off the bacteria.</P>
      <P>Each year, a large number of black-faced spoonbills migrate from
the Korean peninsula and northeastern mainland China to the Chiku
wetlands to spend the winter. Last year's die-off was the first of
its kind.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Friday that the
country's military budget and procurement systems are
institutionalized, transparent and in compliance with existing laws.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks while answering questions at a legislative
interpellation session from opposition Kuomintang Legislator Ho
Tsai-feng, who argued that it is extremely inappropriate of President
Chen Shui-bian to attend a dinner party Friday in New York at which a
U.S. arms dealer will also be present as a co-host.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Chen will be only a guest at the dinner banquet
hosted by the New York-based International League for Human Rights
(ILHR) in his honor, Yu claimed that it will be "impossible" for the
president to discuss any relevant issues with the individual, let
alone make any promises to him in the public eye.</P>
      <P>"The ILHR's decision to present a human rights award to President
Chen was also made in line with objective values in a country ruled
by law," the premier noted.</P>
      <P>Commenting on media speculation that a speech to be given by Chen
at the dinner party will have to be screened in advance by the U.S.
authorities, Foreign Affairs Vice Minister Kau Ying-mao categorically
denied the speculation. He stressed that "two-way contacts are close
between Taiwan and the United States, and the government will also
stick to its basic principles."</P>
      <P>"The dinner banquet has been arranged by the ILHR and President
Chen is not in a position to make any comment on the issue, " he
further explained.</P>
      <P>Traveling at the head of a 100-member delegation, Chen left
Taiwan Friday local time for New York for a two-day transit stop en
route to Panama, where he will take part in the Central American
diplomatic partner's Nov. 3 centenary celebrations.</P>
      <P>During his short stay in New York, the non-government ILHR will
present its 2003 Human Rights Award to Chen Friday in recognition of
his contributions to Taiwan's human rights and democratization,
following which the president will give a 20-minute speech.</P>

(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"U.S. relations with China are in good
shape, but it's not that we don't have difficult issues," Dr.
Condoleezza Rice, assistant to the President for national security
affairs, said Thursday at a briefing on U.S. foreign policy for
foreign journalists based in New York.</P>
      <P>Rice pointed out that the U.S. has concerns about nuclear
proliferation, about the progress in China towards human rights and
religious freedom, and is concerned that China may not be faithful to
its WTO obligations.</P>
      <P>The White House national security adviser said that in the recent
six-party talks over the Korean peninsula situation, China showed
that it was not only a host, but also played a central role in the
talks.</P>
      <P>"Everybody in that region, Japan, South Korea, Russia, and most
of all, China recognizes that a non-nuclear Korean peninsula is
essential to peace and security, not only in the Korean sense, but in
Northeast Asia and in the world," she said.</P>
      <P>Rice began the briefing with a report on the U.S. prospect of
building a "just, decent, modern and democratic Iraq." She called on
the international community to lend a helping hand in rebuilding Iraq.</P>
      <P>Condemning the terrorist attacks on aid workers of international
organizations and the Iraqi people, Rice said that the brutal killers
have made Red Cross workers and innocent people their victims. The
terrorists are blocking the road to Iraq becoming a democratic
country, she added.</P>
      <P>Referring to the Palestine issue, Rice said that all parties,
including Israel, Palestine and the neighboring Mideast countries,
should commit themselves to a peaceful resolution.</P>

      <P>Police announced Friday that they had
busted a large amphetamine manufacturing factory in Kaohsiung,
southern Taiwan, seizing amphetamine with an estimated street value
of NT$500 million (US$14.28 million).</P>
      <P>Police and investigation agents raided the factory in Taliao,
Kaohsiung County, the previous day, seizing 14 kg of amphetamine in
solid form and nearly 700 kg in liquid form, as well as a large
amount of equipment used to manufacture the drug.</P>
      <P>Police arrested chief suspect Lee Wen-cheng and were continuing
to track down two other suspects, who were still at large. It was the
ninth amphetamine manufacturing plant to be busted this year.</P>
      <P>Police were tipped off in October 2002 that Lee was preparing to
produce amphetamine and they conducted the raid after an extensive
surveillance operation.</P>
      <P>Law enforcement authorities noted that drug dealers in the past
have tended to manufacture amphetamine in Taiwan for export overseas.
Later, they began producing the drug in mainland China, bringing it
back to Taiwan for export.</P>
      <P>However, recent signs have shown that producers have begun to
relocate their overseas manufacturing plants back to Taiwan, hence a
recent rise in amphetamine production activities.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There is a noticeable gap between Taiwan
proper and the smaller islands it controls regarding English teaching
resources and learning environments, according to a recent survey
conducted by the privately run King Car Education Foundation.</P>
      <P>The poll results show that 93.6 percent of school children
questioned around the country think it is important to learn English,
a stark contrast to just 9 percent who do not think so. However, the
poll also revealed that only 34 percent of those polled really enjoy
learning English, while 38 percent in Taipei County acknowledged that
they learn English only in order to pass examinations.</P>
      <P>The results also show that a larger ratio of primary school
students on the islands do not like learning English and that there
are insufficient English textbooks and language learning activities
at their schools. Some 47 percent of them said they have never read
any English books, while about 44 percent said they have no
confidence in talking with foreigners in English.</P>
      <P>Similar surveys carried out in the past mainly focused on the
differences between the north and the south, but the King Car
investigation reveals that the gap between Taiwan proper and the
remoter islands is growing increasingly wide, a foundation official
said.</P>
      <P>Although the government means well in providing English education
to elementary school children, he reminded the education authorities
that they need to pay heed to the problem of inadequate teaching
resources and facilities on the islands and in remote areas.</P>
      <P>The government should pay close attention when allocating budgets
and resources in this field, he suggested, adding that the foundation
has donated 800 English-language children's books to Kinmen County
and has also recruited a group of voluntary foreign teachers to teach
English there on a short-term basis.</P>
      <P>The survey, carried out earlier this month, collected valid

should declare independence is non-existent.</P>

      <P>While some people have adopted the viewpoint that Taiwan's status
remains problematic, Yu claimed that the issue is actually
non-existent.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-run China Shipbuilding Corp.
(CSBC) reiterated Friday that it is capable of building submarines.</P>
      <P>CSBC restated its submarine building capabilities in the wake of
reports from the Legislative Yuan Friday that an eight-member U.S.
group, headed by Gibson G. LeBoeuf, deputy chief of the U.S. Navy
International Program Department, expressed its hope that the CSBC
not take part in building the submarines given its incapability
of developing submarines.</P>
      <P>The U.S. officials were quoted by opposition Kuomintang
Legislator Kao Chung-yuan as saying that CSBC'S ship assembling
capability is probably O.K., but its capabilities in developing
weapon systems, dynamic systems and electronic instruments -- vital
parts of a submarine -- are inadequate.</P>
      <P>The U.S. officials expressed their hopes at the Legislative Yuan
Thursday that Taiwan's Legislature will pass the budget -- between
NT$300 billion and NT$400 billion (US$8.85 billion - US$11.8 billion)
for eight diesel-powered submarines -- for the submarine procurement
project by July 2004 to pave the way for a speedy implementation of
the plan.</P>
      <P>Referring to an assessment report filed recently by a German
consultant group, CSBC officials said that CSBC is capable of
building submarines, given the strength of the CSBC and the Republic
of China Navy, as well as the capabilities of the private industrial
sector.</P>
      <P>The idea of the CSBC building submarines for Taiwan is by no
means a fantasy, said members of the German consultant group, who
recently completed a one-week assessment tour of Taiwan, mainly
visiting CSBC's plants.</P>
      <P>By combining the capabilities and resources of the ROC Navy and
Taiwan's private industrial sector, the CSBC could produce submarines
after upgrading some of its facilities by introducing some
cutting-edge technologies and employing younger welders, the German
consultants said in a recently-released assessment report.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan established a cross-division ad hoc committee,
headed by Vice Premier Lin Hsin-yi, in January this year to
facilitate plans calling for some of the eight diesel-powered
submarines that the United States has promised to sell to Taiwan to
be built in Taiwan by the CSBC.</P>
      <P>CSBC officials said that the CSBC has built a simulated model of
a section of pressure hull for a submarine and is now focusing on
more advanced research such as building the end plate of a pressure
hull.</P>
      <P>CSBC officials said that the company's 2,300-plus staff at the
Kaohsiung Shipyard should be capable of building the submarines if
the company can get the technology from the United States and other
countries that have experience in sub-building.</P>
      <P>The officials said that there is a lot of follow-up maintenance
work on submarines, and that only by building a submarine itself can
the CSBC be able to effectively supply follow-up maintenance
operations.</P>
      <P>The U.S. government announced in 2001 a robust package of arms it
had agreed to sell to Taiwan, including the eight diesel-powered
submarines.</P>
      <P>Taiwan formally filed a request in 1995 for procurement of the
subs from the United States in an effort to beef up its deterrence
capabilities against possible attempts by mainland China to blockade
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to CSBC officials, it is hoped that a "2-2-2-2" plan
will be followed in the building of the eight diesel-powered subs,
where the first two subs are built totally in the United States or
elsewhere abroad, one-third of the third and fourth subs are built in
Taiwan, two-thirds of the fifth and sixth subs are manufactured in
Taiwan, and the last two subs are built completely in Taiwan.</P>

an official visit.</P>
      <P>The president said that he will attend the centennial

receive an international human rights award as well as pay respects
to Madame Chiang Kai-shek, who passed away at her Manhattan home last

      <P>The president said that "due to the concerted efforts of Taiwan

the General Staff will no longer be present to see the president off

Award, at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City where he will
stay.</P>
      <P>This will be the first time that the leader of the Republic of
China has been bestowed with such an honor. The president will deliver
a 20-minute speech on human rights issues after accepting the award.</P>
      <P>On Nov. 1 New York time, the president will receive U.S.
politicians, visit 911 Ground Zero and attend a dinner aboard a
cruise vessel on the Hudson River to be given in his honor by major
Taiwanese associations in the greater New York area.</P>
      <P>The president will leave New York on the morning of Nov. 2
for Panama. He will meet with accompanying media at a tea party and
meet with representatives of overseas Chinese and ROC technical
missions in the afternoon before attending a dinner to be given in
his honor.</P>
      <P>Chen will attend the Central American country's centennial
celebration on Nov. 3. Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso will
accompany President Chen and leaders from other nations and

council square to attend a flag-raising ceremony and prayer
ceremony for the nation.</P>
      <P>President Chen will then attend a centennial celebration ceremony.

Foreign Affairs Building. Chen will attend a luncheon in his
honor given by President Moscoso and other national leaders.</P>

ceremony to commemorate the renovation of a church and national
theater and the completion of a children's museum before leaving for
Anchorage, Alaska.</P>
      <P>On Nov. 5, Alaska time, the president will take a three-and-half
hour train ride to view the magnificent scenery of Alaska
and attend a luncheon given by Alaska Governor Frank H. Murkowski, a
staunch supporter of Taiwan. He is scheduled to return to Taipei
on Nov. 6.</P>

Secretary-General Kang Ning-hsiung, Presidential Office Deputy

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 60 lawmakers from across the
political spectrum formed a new association Friday to boost
parliamentary exchanges between Taiwan and Canada.</P>
      <P>Legislator Cheng Kuo-chung of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) said he and his colleagues decided to form the ROC
(Taiwan)-Canada Parliamentary Friendship Association after their
Canadian counterparts took the initiative to establish an amity
group last year to promote exchanges with Taiwan's legislative branch.</P>
      <P>To the best of his understanding, Cheng said, 109 Canadian
parliamentarians have joined the Canada-Taiwan Parliamentary
Friendship Group.</P>
      <P>John MaKay, president of the Canada-Taiwan Parliamentary
Friendship Group, extended his congratulations on the establishment
of a parallel parliamentary group in Taiwan via a video tribute.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Michael Ying-mao Kau and Ted
Lipman, executive director of the Canadian Trade Office in Taipei,
which represents Canadian interests in Taiwan in the absence of
formal diplomatic ties, attended the inaugural ceremony of the new
friendship group in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, Lipman said Canada-Taiwan trade
and economic relations have been cordial, with bilateral trade volume
growing continually.</P>
      <P>Two-way exchanges in other fields have also been growing
steadily, Lipman said, adding that three Canadian parliamentary
delegations have visited Taiwan over the past year.</P>
      <P>Lipman said the establishment of the ROC (Taiwan)-Canada
Parliamentary Friendship Association is of great significance in
the development of relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>For his part, Kau said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will
offer full support for the new parliamentary amity group as it
marks an important step in promoting bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties, Kau said,
Taiwan-Canada relations have been close. Taiwan citizens make
an average of 150,000 visits to Canada annually,
making Taiwan Canada's seventh largest source of tourist
arrivals. The number of Taiwan expatriates in Canada, including those
doing advanced study there, has also been rising steadily.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MILITARY PROCUREMENT IS INSTITUTIONALIZED: TANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 31 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of National Defense Tang Yiau-min
said Friday that the major military procurement plans of the nation
have been institutionalized, with decisions made systematically.</P>
      <P>"Once the decisions are made, no individuals are supposed to
exert personal clout to alter the decisions, " Tang said at the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Tang said that since he assumed office, he has seen to it that
all major military and weaponry procurement projects have been
implemented systematically, with the Ministry of National Defense
(MND) hammering out procurement draft plans first. The drafts are
then approved by the Executive Yuan and submitted to the Legislative
Yuan for passage before those plans are actually carried out.</P>
      <P>Tang made the remarks at the Legislative Yuan in response to
questions regarding Taiwan's military purchases from the United
States.</P>
      <P>During an interpellation session, he was asked about the truth of
allegations that President Chen Shui-bian is going to meet with U.S.
arms suppliers during his two-day transit stop in New York on his way
to Panama for a state visit, and whether his U.S. visit involves a
conflict of interests.</P>
      <P>Tang declined to make comments on those allegations, and said
that the MND has not sent an official as a member of President Chen's
entourage.</P>
      <P>In a rare visit to the Legislative Yuan Thursday, a group of U.S.
Navy officials actively lobbied a submarine sales plan to Taiwan -- a
procurement that would cost between NT$300 billion and NT$400 billion
(US$8.85 billion - US$11.8 billion) for eight diesel-powered
submarines.</P>
      <P>The eight-member U.S. group, headed by Gibson G. LeBoeuf, deputy
chief of the U.S. Navy International Program Department, expressed
its hope at the Legislative Yuan that Taiwan's Legislature will pass
the budget for the submarine procurement project by July 2004 to pave
the way for aspeedy implementation of the plan.</P>
      <P>Since the United States stopped producing diesel submarines long
ago, its contractors will have to cooperate with their European
counterparts to build the subs for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>LeBoeuf and his group members said that the United States will be
instrumental in arranging the building of the eight 2,000-ton diesel
submarines by either Germany or Spain.</P>
      <P>The U.S. officials were apparently not very agreeable to notions
that Taiwan's state-run China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) undertake the
building of the eight diesel submarines.</P>
      <P>They were quoted by opposition Kuomintang Legislator Kao
Chung-yuan as saying that the CSBC had better not take part in
building the submarines. They said that CSBC'S capability to assemble
ships is probably O.K., but its capabilities in developing weapon
systems, dynamic systems and electronic instruments -- vital parts of
a submarine -- are inadequate, according to Kao.</P>
      <P>Most of the legislators who have been pushing for plans allowing
CSBC to build part of the eight diesel submarines that the United
States planned to sell to Taiwan are displeased with the opinions of
the U.S. Navy officials.</P>
      <P>The U.S. government announced in 2001 a robust package of arms it
had agreed to sell to Taiwan, including the eight diesel-powered
submarines.</P>
      <P>Taiwan formally filed a request in 1995 for procurement of the
submarines from the United States in an effort to beef up its
deterrence capabilities against possible attempts by mainland China
to blockade Taiwan.</P>
