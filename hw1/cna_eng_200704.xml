      <P>A researcher at the National Tsing Hua University in Hsinchu, northern Taiwan
has won the Hiwin Science Award Saturday for developing a method to help detect
blood vessel tumors, called hemangiomas, in brain.</P>
      <P>Tsai Tsung-han,  who has just won his master's degree in mechanical engineering
from Tsing Hua, will receive a gold medal in addition to NT$800,000 (US$24,177)
cash award, according to an executive of the Hiwin Technologies Corp. which
sponsors the prize.</P>
      <P>Tsai developed the method to predict the rupture location of hemangiomas in the
brain based on the theory that the development of tumors on blood vessel will
inevitably change the blood flow in the vessel, and thereby betray their
existence.</P>
      <P>With the help of the Veterans General Hospital in Taipei, Tsai analyzed the
brain images, made by magnetic resonance imaging angiography, of patients who
suffered from the burst of hemangiomas , and found regular subtle changes in
blood flow of these patients.</P>
      <P>Based on his analyses, Tsai can predict with an accuracy of between 60 percent
and 80 percent, the rupture place of the blood vessel tumors and thereby help
with their diagnosis.</P>

      <P>Taitung County Deputy Magistrate Huang Fa-lou was taken into custody early
Sunday on charges of corruption after public prosecutors with the Taitung
District Court interrogated him over his involvement in a construction contract
bid rigging case four years ago.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors suspected that Huang had received kickbacks after bid rigging in
the awarding of contracts for construction projects while he was acting head of
Taitung County's Dajen township in 2003.</P>
      <P>After searching Huang's home and office, prosecutors brought him to the Public
Prosecutors' Office for questioning regarding his role in the corruption case.</P>
      <P>To prevent collusion between Huang and other defendants, and in view of the fact
that the offense carries a minimum sentence of seven years imprisonment, the
court granted the prosecutors' request to detain Huang.</P>
      <P>Individuals in 14 of Taitung County's 16 townships have been under investigation
for receiving kickbacks and allowing bid rigging and bidder collusion in local
government procedures for awarding construction contracts five years ago.</P>
      <P>Three former heads of the townships of Tungho, Chenkung and Changbin have been

      <P>Former main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday that
he will invite Legislature Speaker Wang Jin-pyng to be his running mate and
jointly challenge the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is widely viewed as the KMT's best bet in the 2008 race, is poised to
register candidacy for the KMT presidential primary. He said Sunday he would
like to have Wang as his running mate even if Wang does not register for the KMT
primary. Registraton for the KMT primary will begin April 3.</P>
      <P>Wang was formerly a KMT vice chairman.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while taking the Taiwan High Speed Railway from Taipei to
the southern city of Tainan.</P>
      <P>Responding to a reporter's inquiry as to whether Ma was worried that Wang, who
has recently expressed his explicit intention to run in the 2008 presidency, may
announce his candidacy as an independent, Ma said he reckons Wang "will probably
not do this."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ma, who resigned as the KMT chairman Feb. 13 upon being charged over
allegedly lining his pockets during his time as Taipei mayor with NT$11 million
(US$332,684) from a special allowance fund set aside for the mayor's
discretionary use, would not speculate on the possible outcome of a court
hearing April 3 when the Taipei District Court addresses his indictment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S.-KOREA FREE TRADE PACT TO HAVE ADVERSE IMPACT ON TAIWAN: MINISTER</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The imminent signing of a free trade agreement between the United States and
South Korea will definitely have an adverse impact on Taiwan, which has been a
major rival to South Korea in terms of industrial production and export trade,
Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long said Sunday.</P>
      <P>It is certain that the U.S.-South Korea free trade pact -- expected to be signed
shortly as bilateral talks are slated to wrap up by Monday -- will have an
effect on Taiwan, although how much and to what extent remain to be seen, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>It is believed that the U.S.-South Korea agreement will have little impact on
Taiwan's agriculture sector, though South Korea may increase its imports of U.S.
agricultural products under the stipulations of the agreement, which might have
the side effect of benefiting Taiwan in terms of the island's imports, Chen
analyzed.</P>
      <P>The U.S.-Korea FTA will also have minor impact on Taiwan's information
technology (IT) industry since the export of most IT products is duty-free under
international practices, Chen said.</P>
      <P>As to other industrial sectors, Chen said, the Economics Ministry will pay close
attention to the contents of the U.S.-Korea FTA to see how it will affect
related sectors in Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>He added that the Economics Ministry is watching closely to determine whether
the U.S.-Korea FTA will prompt more U.S. companies to invest in South Korea or
bring about closer cooperation in business and trade sectors between the two
countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HOPES JAPAN WILL RECIPROCATE BY OPENING DOOR TO TAIWAN PORK</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's animal husbandry industry executives expressed hopes Sunday that Japan
will reciprocate by opening its door to Taiwan pork exports since Japan has been
exporting many of its agricultural products in large quantities to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Huang Chin-jung, chairman of the non-profit National Animal Industry Foundation,
who recently led a Taiwan delegation to visit agricultural operations on Japan's
northern island of Hokkaido, said governments of various levels are striving to
root out foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) from Taiwan's farms in the hope that the
disease will be eradicated once and for all within a couple of years, meaning
that Taiwanese-produced pork will again be allowed access to Japan's meat
markets.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's pork exports have been barred from Japan since 1997 after an outbreak
of FMD on animal farms around the island that same year.</P>
      <P>Under concerted government efforts, some areas, including the offshore county of
Penghu, have successfully eradicated FMD through organic means instead of using
vaccination, Huang said, adding that all animal farms in Taiwan are expected to
stop vaccinating their cultured livestock by August 2008 -- at the same time
also paving the way for Taiwan to become an FMD-free country, Huang noted.</P>
      <P>During last week's trip to Hokkaido, Huang said, members of the Taiwan
delegation of animal farm operators met with their Japanese counterparts and
were told that the farmers associations from Hokkaido have enjoyed brisk
businesses exporting their produce and output to Taiwan, including Chinese yams,
dairy products, grape wine and other agricultural products.</P>

      <P>The screening process will soon begin to select the winners of the 2007 eminence

Economic Affairs said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The bureau's annual selection of award winners is now in its ninth year. The
deadline for submitting entries for this year is set for April 2.</P>
      <P>National Taiwan Normal University, organizer of the event, will invite experts

      <P>One school each from Taiwan's northern, central, southern and eastern regions
will emerge as an eminence award winner. The four winners will each receive a

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) has revoked the commercial license for Zelmac, a
drug for women to relieve constipation, and demanded an immediate recall of the
drug from store shelves because it may cause angina and raise the chances of
stroke and heart diseases, an official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The DOH imposed the sales ban after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
revoked import licenses of the drug and requested that the Swiss pharmaceutical
maker Novartis, which makes Zelmac, suspended sales of the drug due to side
effects it may cause, the official added.</P>
      <P>Zelmac, which is currently available in more than 30 countries, gained
regulatory approval for sale in Taiwan's market in 2003, according to the
official.</P>
      <P>Since the use of Zelmac is not covered in the National Health Insurance Program
and the number of users is limited, the DOH estimates that not many people will
be affected by the suspension of the sales of the drug, which is used mainly for
short-term treatment of women under the age of 65 with constipation-predominant
irritable bowel syndrome, the official said.</P>
      <P>The DOH official urged those taking the drug to consult with their doctors to
see whether they should find alternative drugs, while calling on those taking
Zelmac and seeing the symptoms of angina and other heart diseases to inform the
DOH via the National Reporting System of Adverse Drug Reactions in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Novartis in Taiwan said that his company decided to pull the
drug off of shelves in Taiwan's market in response to the DOH demand. According
to a U.S. study, 13 out of 11,600 patients treated with Zelmac suffered
potentially ischemia heart disease and angina as compared to one out of 7,000
people treated with placebos.</P>
      <P>The Novartis said the statistically significant imbalance of cardiovascular
events between patients taking Zelmac and those taking a placebo prompted the
FDA to take the action.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ACADEMICS PONDER ETHICAL ISSUE OF BIOBANK PLANS</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of academics and medical professionals gathered Sunday to ponder ethical
issues and related controversies that might arise from the establishment of a
national biobank.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a colloquium organized by the Foundation of Medical Professionals
Alliance in Taiwan, Tsai Tu-chien, director of Taipei Medical University's
Institute of Medical Humanities, said more legal professionals are needed to
pitch in to build a legal framework concerning human genome studies and possible
establishment of a biobank in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Building a legal framework -- aimed at supervising the biobank in terms of
ethical and related issues -- will at least help alleviate doubts harbored by
aboriginal people and help win their trust regarding the planned biobank, Tsai
added.</P>
      <P>An Academia Sinica plan to construct a "Taiwanese Biobank" -- based on a pool of
native genes, and with the aims of running massive, cross-generation studies to
understand the interconnections between Taiwanese and the local environment, and
enhancing the efficacy of disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment -- was
shelved last year after human rights groups intervened to voice aboriginal
people's doubts and anger regarding the plan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Lee  Jui-chuan,  director  of National  Central University's
Institute of Philosophy, said the indigenous people as well as the general
public are hesitant to embrace the plan due to fears that their genes and
genetic data might be abused, resulting in their privacy being infringed or
their families stigmatized.</P>
      <P>Lee suggested that together with the establishment of the "Taiwanese Biobank, "
there should be a feedback mechanism to allow genetic donors to be reasonably
rewarded if any commercial dividends result from the establishment of the
biobank.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the colloquium, Lee Tsung-hsi, director of National Dong Hwa
University's Institute for Financial and Economic Law Studies, said current laws
and statutes in this country are insufficient to govern the establishment and
operations of a human genome center.</P>
      <P>He said related laws and statutes should be beefed up since research on the
human genome involves the protection of privacy of individuals and their
families, and well as patent rights, rewards, and business interests.</P>

      <P>A former vice chairman of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said Sunday that if he
is elected KMT chairman, he will consider retirement after the 2008 presidential
election no matter whether the KMT ticket wins or loses the election.</P>
      <P>Speaking in a TV debate with another contender for the KMT chairmanship, Wu Poh-
hsiung said that if elected KMT chairman, he would be willing to quit the post
to accept responsibility if the party loses the presidential election in 2008.</P>
      <P>"Even if the party wins the election, I would consider retiring, because after
completing my task, I would have no regrets in doing so," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NICARAGUAN FOREIGN MINISTER WELCOME TO VISIT TAIWAN ANYTIME: MOFA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nicaraguan Minister of Foreign Affairs Samuel Santos is welcome to visit Taipei
at his convenience, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Chieh-yeh said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks after a local newspaper reported earlier in the day that
Santos had canceled his plans to visit Taiwan at the head of a delegation to
discuss feasible bilateral cooperative projects in various fields.</P>
      <P>Santos signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with his Taiwanese
counterpart, James Huang, at Managua International Airport Jan. 11 on bilateral
trade and investment cooperation, with President Chen Shui-bian acting as
witness.</P>
      <P>On that occasion, he also announced that he would headed a delegation of
officials and business executives to visit Taiwan in March to flesh out details
on future cooperation. The MOU was the first diplomatic document Nicaragua has
singed with a foreign government after Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega took
office a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Due to his busy schedule, Santos failed to come to Taiwan in March. Wang
affirmed Sunday that Taiwan will welcome Santos' visit at any time of his
convenience.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's ambassador to Nicaragua, Hung Ming-ta, said Santos has
rescheduled his Taiwan travel plan to late April.</P>
      <P>Hung told the CNA correspondent stationed in Panama City by phone that Santos
now plans to depart Managua for Taipei in late April to deliver on his promise
to visit Taiwan. Nevertheless, Hung said, the exact itinerary of Santos's
planned visit has yet to be finalized.</P>
      <P>Hung also said the Nicaraguan government has decided in principle to maintain
diplomatic relations with Taiwan while seeking to develop commercial ties with
China.</P>
      <P>According to Hung, Ortega has indeed expressed an interest in forging relations
with China. "But Ortega has not used the term of 'resuming diplomatic ties with
China' as claimed by the news media, " he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan respects Nicaragua's foreign policy, Hung said Taiwan would
be pleased to see Nicaragua develop commercial ties with other countries,
including China. "We would not oppose our diplomatic allies forging unofficial
or non-diplomatic links with China, " he added.</P>
      <P>In the run-up to the Nicaraguan presidential election last year, Hung recalled
that Ortega's Sandinista party had indeed considered "resuming" diplomatic ties
with China if it returned to power.</P>
      <P>Through his assiduous efforts, Hung said he managed to meet with Ortega three
times before the latter's inauguration, including a meeting held at his home,
and obtained Ortega's verbal promise to maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As a result, Hung said Ortega assured President Chen after his inauguration that
Nicaragua's diplomatic relations with Taiwan will remain unchanged.</P>

      <P>To ensure economic growth in the 21st century, the government needs to adopt new
strategies to grapple with emerging challenges, such as graying population and
degradation of the environment and the atmosphere, a business celebrity said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Morris Chang, chairman of the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) --
the world's top contract chip maker -- made the remarks while delivering a
keynote speech titled "Emerging Challenges to Economic Growth" at the Ketagalan
Institute in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>Chang said that market economics were victorious in the 20th century, as western
Europe, Japan, Asia's Four Little Dragons, China, Russia, and eastern Europe all
experienced substantial economic growth by following in the footsteps of the
U.S. in moving towards market economies.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan could improve its economic performance by means of
conducting educational and legislative reforms, bolstering infrastructure
development, and promoting cultural, artistic and moral values.</P>
      <P>He said that the emerging challenges to economic growth include depletion of
water and other natural resources, the degradation of the environment, pollution
of the atmosphere, the impact from global economic competition, graying
populations, and the people's high expectations.</P>

      <P>A group of pro-independence activists erected a new signboard at a memorial park
dedicated to the late President Chiang Kai-shek in downtown Taipei Sunday to
push the government to rename the complex as the "Taiwan Democracy Memorial
Park."</P>
      <P>The activists, led by Peter Wang, convener of the 908 Taiwan Republic Campaign,
urged the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration to respond
positively to their call for dismantling the stone walls of the Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall complex and redesignating it as the "Taiwan Democracy Memorial
Park" before the end of this month.</P>
      <P>Otherwise, Wang said his organization will demolish the wall on its own in May.</P>
      <P>Wang and his followers held a ceremonial ritual at the main entrance to the
complex to symbolize their determination to topple the "feudalistic walls" and
push for the opening of the location as a "democracy plaza." At the end of the
ritual, they erected a wooden signboard near the gate that reads "Taiwan
Democracy Memorial Park." The signboard was removed by security guards shortly
afterwards.</P>
      <P>The ceremonial ritual took place a day after the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) staged a protest march through Taipei to defend Chiang whom the DPP
administration has begun harshly criticizing -- 32 years after his death.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, President Chen Shui-bian said at an occasion marking the 60th
anniversary of the tragic 228 Incident that Chiang was responsible for the
suppression of the mass uprising on the island in 1947 against his government's
rule that claimed as many as 30,000 lives.</P>
      <P>The KMT-organized protest came as the DPP administration has stepped up its
efforts to remove Chiang's statues from public places throughout Taiwan and
remove references to China from state-run companies and institutions.</P>
      <P>Chanting "Love Taiwan, defend the Republic of China," the largely elderly crowd
circled around the large square that surround the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall,
housing a massive bronze statue of the former leader, who once ruled China.</P>
      <P>Chiang, who died in 1975, has been a controversial figure in Taiwan since

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Sunday that the previous "party-state"  system,
cultism and greater China consciousness have been major stumbling blocks to
Taiwan's ultimate goal of becoming a normal and complete modern country.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a ceremony marking the seventh anniversary of Ketagalan Institute,
Chen said those stumbling blocks have also threatened the goal of defending
Taiwan's democratic status quo and peace in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Under the party-center governing system which characterized the previous
Kuomintang (KMT) rule, Chen said the interests of the ruling party took
precedence over the national interests. As a result, the military served the
ruling party's interests and the public money and properties were often used for
partisan interests.</P>
      <P>Noting that such a system violates the democratic principles that require fair
competition among different political parties and separation of the state and
the ruling party, Chen said his administration opposes such a system and is thus
determined to push the KMT to return its ill-gotten party assets to the national
coffers.</P>
      <P>Chen further said that his ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) opposes
cultism. Against this backdrop, he said, the DPP administration feels compelled
to shed light on the late President Chiang Kai-shek's suppression of human
rights and hold him responsible for the infamous 228 Incident of 1947 in which
many innocent people were killed brutally.</P>
      <P>In order to safeguard Taiwan's distinct identity and its hard-won democratic
system, Chen said, his administration must push for the birth of a new
constitution that fits Taiwan's situation and must get rid of reference to China
from state-own companies and various institutions.</P>
      <P>"All these efforts are aimed at preserving Taiwan's democratic status quo and
its separate national identity as well as safeguard peace in the Taiwan Strait,
" Chen said, adding that none of these actions have anything to do with fanning
ethnic rifts and conflicts.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan will soon unveil an investigative report on legal infractions
or transgressions by commissioners of the controversial National Communications
Commission (NCC), an official said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the official who preferred anonymity, the Executive Yuan formed a
special task force in mid-February to investigate whether the NCC was guilty of
dereliction of duty or in violation of any laws in reaching an out-of-court
settlement late last year with Broadcasting Corp. of China (BCC) over a 2004
decision by the Government Information Office to reclaim two BCC-controlled
radio channels.</P>
      <P>The task force was headed  by Minister-with-Portfolio  Hsu Chih-hsiung. After
more than a month of intensive probes, the official said, the task force has
come up with a comprehensive investigative report that identifies 10
transgressions involving various NCC members.</P>
      <P>Noting that revoking the BCC control of the two radio channels is the
government's established policy, the official said the NCC is not authorized to
override the Executive Yuan's decision by settling the issue with BCC out of
court.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the official said the task force discovered other transgressions,
including three commissioners  illegally taking part-time jobs and one other
commissioner having his son serve as his officially paid chauffeur.</P>
      <P>The report also pointed out that two commissioners were present at meetings
screening  ownership  transfers  of two opposition Kuomintang-owned media
outlets -- China Television Co. and BCC -- in violation of the principle of
avoiding conflicts of interest. The two commissioners have ties with the two
KMT-held media organizations.</P>
      <P>Claiming that all of these transgressions are very serious violations of
existing laws and ethical rules, the official said the task force has
recommended penalties for law-breaking commissioners, including suspending them
from their jobs or referring the cases to the Commission on the Disciplinary
Sanctions of Functionaries or the Control Yuan for censure and discipline.</P>
      <P>Some of the more serious cases may be referred to judicial authorities to
determine whether the commissioners in question have violated existing laws
against graft and corruption, the official added.</P>
      <P>The planned release of the NCC transgressions report comes at a time when the
media regulatory body has been under fire for its decision last Friday to fine
two cable TV channels -- TVBS and TVBS-N -- and demand the resignation of the
TVBS president over the mishandling and broadcasting of a gangster's video, with
some arguing the punishment was not harsh enough and others criticizing the
commission for "crossing the line."</P>
      <P>The Executive  Yuan  official  said the timing  is purely coincidental as the
task force began the probes into the NCC legal transgressions long before the
outbreak of the recent "gangster's footage" controversy.</P>
      <P>The NCC was created last year, with commissioners recommended by major political
parties in proportion to the number of seats the parties hold in the Legislative
Yuan. Such a partisan-based formation has been declared unconstitutional by the
Council of Grand Justices, which has set Dec. 31, 2008 as deadline for
disbanding the body. The NCC commissioners already determined to step down when
the tenure of the current legislators expires Jan. 31, 2008.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CAMPAIGN AGAINST FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE ENTERS CRITICAL PERIOD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  2 (CNA)
04/02/07  13:32:14
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The campaign to rid the country of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) has entered a
critical period, with hog ranches around Taiwan gradually halting the
vaccination of their pigs in five phases beginning Monday.</P>
      <P>Council of Agriculture (COA) officials in charge of animal health inspection and
quarantine urged local hog and swine farmers to cooperate with the government in
efforts to wipe out the highly contagious animal disease once and for all.</P>
      <P>FMD is one of the most contagious diseases among mammals and has a great
potential for causing severe economic losses. It affects cloven-hoofed animals.</P>
      <P>A major FMD outbreak in March 1997 dealt a severe blow to Taiwan's hog industry,
as FMD-affected countries are banned from exporting pork and related products.</P>
      <P>The outbreak 10 years ago led to the culling of millions of hogs, and all pig
farmers have since been required to have their animals vaccinated regularly.
Thanks to the concerted efforts of the public and private sectors, no further
FMD cases have been reported since February 2001.</P>
      <P>On May 22, 2004, the Paris-based World Organization for Animal Health  (OIE)
recognized  Taiwan  as an "FMD-free  zone with vaccination."</P>
      <P>The government's ultimate goal is to obtain OIE certification as an "FMD-free
zone without vaccination" in two years, COA officials said, adding that to
attain this goal, local hog ranches must stop vaccinating their livestock in a
gradual manner beginning this month.</P>
      <P>On an experimental basis, inoculation of pigs raised on the outlying island of
Penghu has been suspended since March 2006. As the program has proceeded
smoothly, the COA has decided to expand the experiment to hog farms on Taiwan
proper in five stages.</P>
      <P>Each stage will last for four months. In the first stage, only hogs raised in
the center pen of each ranch should stop receiving FMD inoculation. Those hogs
will be subject to close surveillance for health checks.</P>
      <P>In the second stage, inoculation should stop for pigs in one pen in each barn,
and in the third stage, vaccination should cease for pigs in one-third of pens
in each barn. In the fourth stage, inoculation should stop for pigs in half of
the pens in each barn.</P>
      <P>In the first four states,  inoculation  of stud pigs and grass-eating
herbivores, including cattle, goat and deer, will not be ceased. If all goes
well, the vaccination cessation project will enter the fifth  and final stage
in August  2008,  with an across-the-board suspension of inoculation.</P>
      <P>According to OIE regulations, a country can be listed as "FMD-free without
vaccination" only if no vaccination has been administered for a full year and if
no new FMD cases have been reported during that period, which means that Taiwan
may reclaim "FMD-free zone without vaccination" status in 2009 at the earliest.</P>
      <P>After Taiwan was declared an "FMD-free zone with vaccination" in 2004, pork
exports to Japan were partially resumed -- for cooked or processed pork products
-- with an annual value of about NT$100 million (about US$3.03 million).</P>
      <P>Prior to the 1997 epidemic, Taiwan raised more than 14 million hogs a year, with
annual production value amounting to NT$100 billion, half of which was generated
from pork exports to Japan.</P>
      <P>The disease has had a seriously adverse impact on Taiwan's livestock and
foodstuff industries. Over the past decade, Taiwan's annual hog production has
dropped steadily, to only 7.09 million hogs last year, with the industry's total
annual production value falling to below NT$60 billion.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A ruling Democratic Progressive Party legislator demanded Monday that Defense
Minister Lee Jye "give the country an explanation" over allegations of the
widespread existence of sexual harassment in the military.</P>
      <P>Hsueh Ling accused Lee of "leadership failure" which she said has allowed the
problem of sexual harassment to continue in the military, adding that this has
in turn caused military discipline "to go down the drain."</P>
      <P>At a news conference that she called at the Legislative Yuan, Hsueh said several
female officers have raised complaints with her about inappropriate behavior by
Vice Adm. Chao Lien-ti, including forcing female officers to kiss him during
soirees of military personnel and their partners.</P>
      <P>Chao, currently the head of an electronic intelligence office under the Ministry
of National Defense (MND), was accused of forcing several female subordinates to
kiss him at gatherings last December and February of this year.</P>
      <P>Chao was also accused in unsigned complaint letters of abusing his power by
using three cars along with three chauffeurs at the MND's expense. One of the
cars was reportedly used exclusively to serve his wife, Hsueh quoted a front-
page China Times report as saying.</P>
      <P>Noting that female members of the military have long suffered sexist remarks and
offensive behavior, Hsueh said the military should be an equal-opportunity
workplace, adding that she does not exclude the possibility of disclosing more
cases of similar sexual harassment in the military  if the MND fails to tackle
the Chao case appropriately.</P>
      <P>Responding to Hsueh's accusation, Deputy Defense Minister Chu Kai-sheng
confirmed that Chao has already been transferred and that investigations have
begun into Chao's alleged inappropriate behavior and abuse of his position.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>TVBS General Manager Lee Tao quit Monday, two days after the National
Communications Commission (NCC) ordered him to step down over TVBS' broadcasting
of a staged video on March 26.</P>
      <P>In a brief statement, Lee said he regrets deeply and feels sorry for failing to
find out in time that a taped death threat purported to have been sent to TVBS
by a wanted gangster was actually made by a TVBS reporter.</P>
      <P>Noting that TVBS crew members are all excellent journalists, Lee appealed to the
public to give them a second chance to mend their ways and prove their great
abilities.</P>
      <P>The outspoken critic of President Chen Shui also said he hopes his resignation
will calm down those politicians offended by TVBS in the past and stop them from
further trying "to wipe out TVBS."</P>
      <P>The controversial  tape in which a gun-flaunting  gangster threatens to kill
another mobster in a personal feud caused a public outcry.</P>
      <P>Although the gangster was nabbed by police on March 29 before he could carry out
his threat, the controversy didn't die down because the police found the tape
was shot with the help of a TVBS reporter.</P>
      <P>Although the TVBS management argued that the reporter pulled the wool over their
eyes by falsely claiming that the tape had been made by the gangster and sent to
him, the public, not to mention politicians from President Chen on down who had
been criticised by TVBS, have jumped at the chance to push the NCC to revoke the
TV station's operating license.</P>
      <P>The NCC, which has been criticized by these politicians as being too lenient in
imposing a "paltry" NT$1 million (US$30,211) fine on TVBS, was challenged by
TVBS supporters for ordering the replacement of Lee Tao, claiming that the NCC
has exceeded its authority by interfering with the governance of a private
company.</P>
      <P>Lee's decision to quit on his own Monday obviously will spare NCC the trouble of
finding a legal basis for its decision to force him to step down, although it
has yet to convince TVBS critics that the punishment is the most the commission
can hand down within its authority.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Monday he will not run in the main
opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) primary for the 2008 presidential election
because the party's rules are custom-made to cater to a "certain individual" and
therefore cannot ensure a fair contest.</P>
      <P>Wang, a former KMT vice chairman, made the announcement in an unusual reading
out of a statement at a news conference held at the Legislative Yuan a day after
former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said he will run in the next presidential
election even if he is convicted of corruption in the first trial.</P>
      <P>As the KMT charter stipulates that any party member who is convicted in the
first trial is not eligible to run in any political election under the party's
banner, Ma's insistence on joining the presidential election would require a
revision to the party charter.</P>
      <P>Wang lamented that the KMT has been dominated by a minority ethnic group since
it moved its seat to Taiwan from China in 1949. As this phenomenon has never
been addressed, he said, the party has failed to win grass-roots majority
support, which eventually resulted in its loss of power in the 2000 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>If the party continues to ignore this problem, Wang said, this will definitely
affect the party's performance in the upcoming legislative and presidential
elections.</P>
      <P>Anticipating that Ma will register his candidacy for the KMT presidential
primary in the coming days, Wang reminded his party that the district court will
also begin proceedings on Ma's alleged special allowance fund misappropriation
case this week.</P>
      <P>Warning that the court proceedings could cast clouds over the party's prospects
in the 2008 presidential election, Wang said the party should urgently establish
a crisis management mechanism to ensure that the KMT-led "pan-blue alliance"
will not be absent from the 2008 race because of judicial or political factors.</P>
      <P>At this  critical  moment,  Wang  said,  the party  needs forward-looking
planning. As to Ma's announcement of his intention to invite Wang to serve as
his running mate, Wang said he will not consider such an offer at the moment.</P>
      <P>Ma was indicted Feb. 13 on charges of embezzling NT$11 million (US$332,684) from
a special allowance fund budgeted for his discretionary use during his term as
Taipei mayor from 1998-2006.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Lee Yi-yang said Monday the Control Yuan, the nation's
highest watchdog body, has not done anything to deal with donation solicitation
by a former chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks after DPP Legislator Sue Huang asked about an announcement
by Shih Ming-teh the previous day that he will begin the next stage of a
campaign to depose President Chen Shui-bian and that he will solicit new
donations for the cause.</P>
      <P>Huang alleged that Shih solicited donations from the public illegally last
August, with the amount collected in a short period of time surpassing NT$100
million (US$3.03 million), and that the government has failed to address the
situation properly.</P>
      <P>Shih's "Million Voices Against Corruption" campaign staged a mass sit-in in
front of the Presidential Office for days in September. At one point, he led
large numbers of "red shirt" protestors to encircle the president's official
residence and the Presidential Office to demand that the president resign over a
series of alleged scandals surrounding his family members and close aides.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that cash given to those taking part in presidential, legislative and
other types of elections as well as political activities is categorized as
political donations.</P>
      <P>Those who solicit donations must open special accounts at the Control Yuan in
order to be able to receive the money, but Shih's campaign has not opened an
account, and this is why the Ministry of the Interior has turned the case over
to the Control Yuan, Lee said.</P>
      <P>According to the Political Donation Law, the Control Yuan is responsible for the
auditing and the meting out of fines. However, Lee lamented, the Control Yuan
"has so far done nothing."</P>
      <P>In response, an official of the Control Yuan said Monday that it cannot deal
with the matter in view of the fact that the Control Yuan seats have yet to be
filled.</P>
      <P>The seats have remained vacant since the term of the previous Control  Yuan
members  expired  in  January  2005.  The opposition-controlled legislature has
continued to refuse to confirm the president's list of nominees to serve on the
Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Yu-nan, director of the Control Yuan's Public Functionary Assets
Disclosure Department, said Monday that under the Political Donation Law, those
who open up special accounts must be political parties, political groups or
candidates in elections, adding that whether Shih, as the head of the campaign,
falls within this category remains to be discussed.</P>
      <P>A committee comprised of Control Yuan members should first decide whether Shih's
activities should be regulated under the law, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also said that he had asked Shih about how the donated money has been
spent last year. The campaign headquarters sent a message to the Control Yuan,
saying that it had spent about half of the collected money. The Control Yuan has
not kept track of the campaign's expenses since the protests petered out late
last year.</P>

      <P>A resident of the Taiwan-held outlying island of Kinmen and two of his brothers-
in-law from China were nabbed early Monday morning for illegally entering into
Republic of China territory, officials from Coast Guard Administration (CGA)
Kinmen station said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yeh Chien-lung, 31, a resident of Kinmen's Chinhu rural township, was monitored
by a CGA radar while accompanying two Chinese men -- identified as Liu
Zhengshun, 27 and Liu Zhengyong, 24, who are Yeh's brothers-in-law from the
southern Chinese province of Hunan -- in an attempt to sneak into Kinmen aboard
a Fujian fishing boat at 1: 56 a.m. Monday.</P>
      <P>The three men -- apprehended for attempting to land on a beach in Liehyu, a
small island to the west of Kinmen, without entrance papers -- were handed over
to the Kinmen District Prosecutor's Office for questioning, CGA officials said.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, he traveled to Xiamen City in Fujian Province two days ago to
meet with the Liu brothers before the three set off from Xiamen for Kinmen
Sunday night aboard a Fujian fishing boat with the idea that the Liu brothers
could visit Kinmen and enjoy a leisurely tour after visiting Yeh's wife -- their
sister -- and the Yehs' new born baby.</P>
      <P>Due to difficulties in applying travel documents to Kinmen, the Liu brothers
decided to travel illegally -- each paying 10,000 Chinese yuan to the Fujian
fishing boat owner for a sail from Xiamen to Kinmen. Yeh himself also paid 2,000
yuan for accompanying the Liu brothers on the trip, according to Yeh.</P>
      <P>Lee Nien-chiao, head of the CGA Kinmen operation, said the Kinmen coast guard
forces have stepped up patrol and surveillance efforts recently as Kinmen has
entered a foggy season, which provides smugglers with golden opportunities to
operate unseen.</P>

including 24 scouts from Japan's Yokohama City, 13 from Japan's Nagoya City, two
from the Philippines, and 76 scouts from Chiayi City.</P>
      <P>Toshio Sekido, leader of the Yokohama team said that he has visited Taiwan many
times but that most of his team members are visiting for the first time. Sekido
also said that he has been impressed by Chiayi City's beautiful scenery and
friendly people.</P>
      <P>One of the members of the Yokohama team, an elementary school teacher, invited
each scout taking part in the camping activity to search for the "Ma Tzou Tao",
which used to serve as a road for horse-drawn vehicles in the city in the past.
"The road is now a very meaningful place for the people of Yokohama City, which
has a population of 3.5 million," she added.</P>
      <P>On the first day of the camping activity, the scouts engaged in folk culture
exchanges and several outdoor activities. Chiayi City's scouts demonstrated the
folk crafts of making flour miniatures, costa cards and colored scarves, while
the scouts from Japan made delicate zoris and origami birds under the guidance
of teachers.</P>
      <P>During the four-day activity, the scouts will visit Chiayi Park and Chiayi City
God Temple and Museum as well as Alishan to experience Taiwan's wonderful
mountain scenery, the official said.</P>

      <P>Imprinting identification numbers on motorbikes has greatly reduced thefts, the
Taipei City Police Department (TCPD) said Monday.</P>
      <P>The National Police Agency last March launched a program that provides
motorcycle owners with free imprinting of a serial engine number or license
plate number on several parts of their bikes, with the aim of discouraging
thieves by making disposal of their loot more difficult.</P>
      <P>TCPD tallies showed that it has assisted in the imprinting of 215,000
motorcycles since the beginning of the program. Officials said the reported
number of motorbike thefts from July 2006 to Feb. 2007 in its precinct has
dropped by 12.62 percent compared to the same period a year earlier:
specifically, from 6995 cases to 6112.</P>
      <P>The government has this year made motorbike imprinting compulsory by making it a
condition for vehicle license renewal and ordering that motorbike manufacturers
put identification numbers on their products firsthand.</P>

      <P>The mini thoracoscope has been used in clinical treatment of pneumothorax since

at National Taiwan University Hospital said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Jin-shing, an expert on thoracoscopic surgery in the NTUH's Department of
Surgery, explained that the hospital began using the mini thoracoscope because
it allows for minimally invasive surgery, adding that the hospital's staff have
refined the operation process by using a new adhesive to reduce the chance of
relapse.</P>
      <P>Conventionally, talcum powder is used to create an adhesive effect in the
surgical process, he noted. But the hospital staff came up with the idea of
replacing talcum powder with the antibiotic "Minocycline, " which proved to be
even more effective while also facilitating recovery. The cost of the new method
is also much lower than the conventional method, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Concepts of interment have evidently undergone dramatic changes over the past
decade given that the cremation ratio rose to 85.6 percent in 2006, a survey on
burial behavior published by the Ministry of the Interior showed Monday.</P>
      <P>Vice Interior Minister Chien Tai-lang announced the results of the survey in the
run-up to the Tombsweeping Day, which falls on April 5.</P>
      <P>Chien noted that the cremation ratio was 58.67 percent in 1997. The figure rose
to 85.6 percent in 2006, showing that the public's ideas about interment have
undergone dramatic changes and that cremation, not traditional burial, is now
the mainstream choice.</P>
      <P>The survey also showed that expenses for burials have decreased by NT$13,612
(US$412.5) over the past 10 years, noting that the expenses averaged NT$354,145
in 2006, down from NT$367,757 in 1997.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that those who followed the dress code of a traditional
funeral accounted for 56.4 percent, and those who wore white, grey, black or
less colorful dress accounted for 40.7 percent, although those who said the
ideal mourning dress should be less colorful than usual accounted for 63
percent, and those who can accept that funerals will be held after the cremation
of the loved ones accounted for 48.2 percent.</P>
      <P>The number of bereaved families asking that funeral service operators take care
of all funeral-related matters accounted for 63.5 percent, while those who asked
for part of the matters of a funeral accounted for 23.1 percent, while two
percent of the families took care of funeral matters themselves.</P>
      <P>Chien noted that Taiwan has entered an era in which society is graying and fewer
children are being born. Funeral services will become ever more important given
this trend, he argued.</P>
      <P>Huang Li-shin, director of the MOI's Department of Civil Affairs, said that to
upgrade the quality of funeral parlor operations, the ministry will actively
help local governments to conduct assessments of funeral parlor operators.</P>
      <P>The ministry commissioned Nanhua University in Chiayi, southern Taiwan, to
conduct the survey on burial behavior between Aug. 1 and Oct. 15,  2006. A total
of 1.009 effective questionnaires were collected.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CHIEF BLASTS EX-KMT HEAD FOR SEEKING PRESIDENCY AMID INDICTMENT</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun criticized Monday
former Kuomintang (KMT) chief Ma Ying-jeou as a "hypocrite" and said that a
political figure so lacking in integrity falls far short of the requirements of
the presidency.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks to reporters after Ma said a day earlier that he is resolved
to take part in the 2008 presidential election even if he is convicted in the
first trial of corruption charges over allegedly embezzling NT$11 million from a
special municipal monthly allowance fund earmarked for his discretionary use
when he served as mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Ma has always been harsh in demanding that DPP figures behave
themselves, Yu accused Ma of lacking self-reflection and called him an "unclean
hypocrite" that does not deserve to become Taiwan's president.</P>
      <P>Ma's embezzlement trial will begin Tuesday in the Taipei District Court.</P>
      <P>Speaking during an interview  with the Taipei-based  China Television Company
Monday, Ma said that his remarks concerning his determination to participate in
the upcoming presidential election were made clear Feb. 13, shortly after he was
indicted over embezzlement charges earlier that same day.</P>
      <P>Ma also suggested that some 6,500 government agency chiefs and department heads
might soon find themselves mired in the same situation in the near future.</P>
      <P>Ma, the KMT aspirant thought most likely able to beat his DPP rival, stepped
down from the KMT's top post Feb. 13 and immediately announced the opening of
his presidential campaign.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, despite the corruption charges, many KMT members still want him
to represent the party in the next presidential election on the grounds that the
KMT's rules are much stricter than Republic of China law, which views the
indicted as not guilty before a final conviction on the third trial.</P>
      <P>Although KMT regulations exclude indicted members from running in any elections,
Ma said that the purpose of the party's "exclusion rules" are "somehow
different" in nature from the reason for his embezzlement charges.</P>
      <P>"We will not hopelessly wait for death while our rivals are doing everything
possible to destroy us," Ma claimed.</P>
      <P>But Ma stressed that the KMT's intention to modify its "exclusion regulations"
at this time is "very inappropriate" if it were out of an effort to secure his
chances of running in the next presidential race.</P>
      <P>The proposed regulation revision must be made with a broader vision to make it a
general rule that could bail out many incumbent or retired government officials
who might find themselves in similar legal trouble  due to their special
allowances  or government subsidies, he opined.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the KMT's legislative caucus displayed its full support for Ma's
presidential bid despite his corruption charges, with caucus members questioning
why DPP heavyweights --  Vice President Annette, Premier Su Tseng-chang, former
premiers Frank Hsieh and Yu -- haven't been probed for their use of special
discretionary accounts.</P>
      <P>Ma must take part in the 2008 presidential election in the face of such a
government and the investigation and judicial system, they said.</P>
      <P>Echoing KMT lawmakers' views, their People First Party (PFP) counterparts said
that they also back Ma to run in the next presidential race, as "Ma remains the
most suitable hopeful" for the KMT-PFP alliance that was formally set up in
January.</P>
      <P>Tseng Tsahn-deng, legislative caucus whip of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU), however, lashed out at Ma for what he called  "Ma's intention  to
deceive  voters through  political mobilization."</P>
      <P>If Ma insists on running in the coming presidential race while still on trial,
it will be obvious that the ex-KMT chairman is seeking to evade prosecution
through vying for presidency, Tseng said.</P>
      <P>A political leader in a modern society must not harbor such a mindset attempting
to blur the lines between politics and the judiciary, he contended.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: New Generation of Qaeda Chiefs Is Seen on Rise

As Al Qaeda rebuilds in Pakistans tribal areas, a new generation of leaders has
emerged under Osama bin Laden to cement control over the networks operations,
according to American intelligence and counterterrorism officials.

The new leaders rose from within the organization after the death or capture of
the operatives that built Al Qaeda before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, leading
to surprise and dismay within United States intelligence agencies about the
groups ability to rebound from an American- led offensive.

Wall Street Journal:Fill Up With Ethanol? One Obstacle Is Big Oil

President Bush, domestic auto makers, farmers and others tout ethanol as a home-
grown alternative to imported oil. Across the Midwest, plants that make the fuel
out of corn are multiplying at a torrid pace. Yet so far, only a tiny fraction
of U.S. service stations let a driver fill up with ethanol. There are a number
of reasons, but one big one is resistance from oil companies.

Although some oil executives voice enthusiasm for alternative fuels, oil-company
policies make it harder for many service stations to stock a fuel called E85, a
blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline.</TEXT>

      <P>A lawmaker of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) confirmed Tuesday that she will
not seek the KMT's nomination for the year-end legislative election because she
believes she would never have the opportunity to fairly compete in the party
primary.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Joanna Lei told reporters that a comrade who may become her rival
in a same district at the party primary has threatened to do everything to cause
her to fall into disgrace.</P>
      <P>Lei said she had filed a complaint with the KMT authorities concerning the
threats but received no response.</P>
      <P>KMT authorities also turned a blind eye to her warning that party primaries in
some districts could be affected by "nominal members" recruited by certain
politicians with the specific purpose of helping them win primary elections, Lei
continued.</P>
      <P>According to Lei, after exhausting all possible avenues, she has come to the
conclusion that she could never get a level playing field in the party primary.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Lei said, she has decided not to join the primary to seek the party's
nomination for the year-end election, but will instead concentrate on doing a
good job during the remaining 10 months of her current term as a legislator.</P>
      <P>Lei stressed that she will neither register as a candidate in any other
district, nor compete with other KMT members for a seat in the legislature as
one of the party's legislators-at-large.</P>
      <P>Pressed  on the reason  for her decision,  Lei said  KMT Secretary-General Wu
Den-yih has made it clear that legislators of the New Party (NP) who joined the
KMT in 2004 will not be permitted to seek the party's appointment as a

      <P>The National Palace of Museum said Monday that it has no plan to check its
collections on a large scale in the near future.</P>
      <P>The world-renowned museum was responding to suggestions by two lawmakers of the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) who asked for more random checks as well as more
collected items be checked to ensure the safety of the museum's priceless
treasures.</P>
      <P>Museum Curator Lin Mun-lee said that the museum had recently been preoccupied
with a series of activities,  including the 80th anniversary of the founding of
the museum in Beijing and the reopening ceremony after the most comprehensive
renovation since it was reestablished in November 1965 following the move of its
vast trove of treasures to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that the museum has no time for a large-scale study of its inventory.
Moreover, since 2001, the museum has conducted random checks every season of
every year to ensure that it keeps track of the collected items.</P>
      <P>If it is necessary for large-scale monitoring, then the museum must report to
the Executive Yuan and notify the Council for Cultural Affairs of its handling
of the matter, Lin said.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislators Lee Ching-an and Kuo Su-chun visited the National Palace Museum
Monday to learn about the collections of the museum and their preservation in
the wake of recent reports that "The Jaded Cabbage, " one of the top jade
attractions of the museum, may have been damaged, although when it was damaged
was not certain.</P>
      <P>Museum officials said random checks on collected items became institutionalized
in 2001. Between 2001 and 2007,  the palace conducted 24 random checks, looking
over an average of 1,400 to 1,700 items annually. The last major check was
conducted in 1991.</P>
      <P>The two lawmakers said that 24 checks are simply too few given that there are

      <P>A non-native born president is very likely to be produced in the 2008 Taiwanese
presidential election as more and more natives have forsworn notions of ethnic
identity, former main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Ma made the comments in an exclusive interview on a program of the Taipei-based
China Television Co.</P>
      <P>Ma, the son of a mainlander who relocated to Taiwan with the KMT regime in the
late 1940s after the KMT lost control of the Chinese mainland in a civil war,
said that he does not believe that his background as a second-generation
mainlander in Taiwan would hinder his presidential bid.</P>
      <P>"I don't think that being a mainlander's descendant will hobble my aspiration to
become a president now that a growing number of Taiwanese people are not paying
attention to the ethnic background of presidential candidates," he said.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, his running in the next presidential election would serve as a
test as whether or not Taiwan society has really left ethnic disputes behind.</P>
      <P>"I have confidence in Taiwan's people, and the country would have no future if
it could not walk away from the shadow cast by the ethnic rift," he said.</P>
      <P>Ma, the hopeful most likely to represent the KMT in the next presidential
contest, stressed that he will first ask Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng,
a KMT stalwart, to join him on the ticket if he wins the party's nomination.</P>
      <P>Although Ma was unsure whether Wang would accept his invitation to be his
running mate, Ma said that he is very sure that the KMT cannot afford a split in
the next presidential race if it wants to win back power.</P>
      <P>Should he be elected president, Ma said he will focus his efforts on improving
Taiwan's economy and relaxing restrictions on Taiwanese companies' China-bound
investments, and on bolstering cross-Taiwan Strait economic exchanges.</P>
      <P>Ma resigned from the KMT chairmanship and formally proclaimed his presidential
ambitions Feb. 13, shortly after he was indicted on corruption charges earlier
that same day by Taipei prosecutors over an alleged misuse of a special
municipal monthly allowance designated for his discretionary use when he served
as mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT LAWMAKERS TO PROPOSE AMENDMENT TO COURT ORGANIC LAW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 2 (CNA)
04/02/07  21:58:55

    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will propose an
amendment to the Court Organic Law to endow the Prosecutors' Personnel Review
Committee (PPRC) with the substantial right to review planned personnel
adjustments in the prosecutorial system, two KMT lawmakers said Monday.</P>
      <P>Legislators Kao Su-po and Joanna C. Lei made the announcement at a press
conference at the Legislative Yuan, explaining that they proposed the amendment
after the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) decided March 28 to replace 12 chief
prosecutors in high and district prosecutors offices, including high-profile
Hsieh Wen-ting, chief prosecutor of the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office, without
seeking a consensus from the PPRC.</P>
      <P>Kao said no one knew Hsieh would be subject to the reshuffle before March 28,
noting that the move is directly responsible for the absence of nine of 17 PPRC
members from a committee meeting debating the MOJ decision.</P>
      <P>Kao described the reshuffle as the "Wednesday Massacre, " comparing it with the
"Saturday Night Massacre" of Oct. 20, 1973, when then president of the United
States, Richard M. Nixon, compelled the attorney general and his deputy to
resign due to his own alleged involvement in the Watergate scandal.</P>
      <P>Kao said that the existing Article 51 of the Court Organic Law states that the
minister of justice has the right to make decisions on personnel adjustments,
but needs to consult with the PPRC in advance.</P>
      <P>Justice Minister Shih Mao-lin, however, nullified the PPRC's consultative
function in accordance with an attempt by the Democratic Progressive Party
government to line up chief prosecutors whose legal opinions favor the first
lady, Wu Shu-jen, who is on trial for indictment on charges of embezzlement from
a special state affairs fund set aside for the president's discretionary use,
the lawmaker accused.</P>
      <P>In this regard, Lei said, the KMT legislative caucus has decided to push for an
amendment to the article to endow the PPRC, which is at present only a
consultant organization to the minister of justice, with the power to screen
personnel before a proposed reshuffle.</P>
      <P>Lei added that the KMT caucus will submit the bill on the amendment to the
legislative procedures committee for it to be placed on the agenda of the
legislative session.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in response to media inquiries on the move to transfer Hsieh away
from his current position, Shih explained that the High Prosecutors Office needs
to reinforce its operations in the fields of sexual offense monitoring,
prisoners' human rights, and protection of the victims of crimes, which will
collectively require the promotion of a new leader.</P>
      <P>Shih also expressed his gratitude to Hsieh for his contributions, while denying
that Hsieh is being replaced because of his alleged inability to fulfill recent
orders.</P>
      <P>Media reprots speculated that Hsieh's transfer might be the result of political
interference, as the chief prosecutor is in charge of a probe into the first
lady's alleged embezzlement. Media reports claimed that the Presidential Office
had applied pressure to the prosecutor in an attempt to make him drop the case.</P>

      <P>A candidate for the chairmanship of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) urged the
party's two presidential hopefuls -- former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and
Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng -- "not to get inflated egos."</P>
      <P>Drawing on his own experience, Wu Poh-hsiung, former KMT vice chairman, said he
had withdrawn from a 1994 election to help James Soong become Taiwan's first
governor elected by popular vote.</P>
      <P>"By inflating their egos, Ma and Wang will only hurt the party," Wu warned.</P>
      <P>He acknowledged that the KMT has something to learn from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) because no matter how fierce the intraparty competition
is among its candidates, the DPP will close ranks to present a united front
after the party primaries.</P>
      <P>Wu said he wished to become the KMT chairman because that would be the best way
for him to help the party choose the candidate with the greatest chance of
winning the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that if he is elected KMT chairman, he will consider retirement
after the 2008 election, no matter whether the KMT ticket wins or loses the
election.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks on a trip to Taitung County to canvass votes from rank-and-
file KMT members in the April 7 KMT chairmanship by-election. He is running
against KMT Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu.</P>
      <P>The KMT chairmanship  became vacant after Ma resigned  in mid-February following
his indictment on charges of embezzlement by a public prosecutor with regard to
the alleged misuse of special mayoral funds during his two terms as Taipei
mayor.</P>
      <P>Wu served as acting chairman for one month in his capacity as the most senior
vice chairman among the KMT's four deputies before resigning his post on March
14. Vice Chairman Chiang Ping-kun is now the acting KMT chairman.</P>

announced Monday.</P>
      <P>The Constitution Reform Alliance held a news conference to unveil the draft
constitution that defines the country's territory asthe area to which the
Constitution is applied.</P>
      <P>The alliance said such a provision contains the concept of 'existing national

line with existing conditions.</P>
      <P>The draft offers no definition of the national flag as the current ROC
Constitution does, stipulating that it be defined by statue.</P>
      <P>According to the draft, the president of Taiwan is a nominal head of state
elected by a presidential recommendation committee and serving a five-year term.</P>
      <P>The highest executive body of the state will be the Cabinet, the draft says,
with the premier elected by members of the lower house of the parliament and
formally appointed by the president.</P>
      <P>Given the support of one-third its members, the lower house can put forward a
motion of non-confidence against the Cabinet six months after the latter's
formation, the draft says.</P>
      <P>While the lower house stands as the major body that represents the citizens'
sovereignty, a senate is elected by local autonomous bodies and indigenous
people to prevent an over-concentration of power in the lower house, the
alliance said.</P>
      <P>The draft allows for future amendments to the Constitution to be ratified by a

the principles of the state and the Constitution, the relations between the

      <P>Sex-related studies are greatly beneficial to Taiwanese society as many social
problems are related to sex, according to a professor at Shu-Te University's
Graduate School of Human Sexuality.</P>
      <P>Lin Yen-chin, the director of the only school of its kind in Taiwan and Asia,
made the remarks Saturday at a press conference aimed at recruiting new
doctorate students.</P>
      <P>The graduate school opened last year and recruited three students for its
doctorate program -- two of whom are medical doctors while the other is an
instructor at an air force college.</P>
      <P>Two students present at the press conference said that Taiwanese society is too
conservative and that people in Taiwan have many misperceptions regarding sex.</P>
      <P>Noting that the general public has a limited understanding of studies of
sexuality, Lin said that sex plays a very important role in human relationships,
and in some pressing problems.</P>
      <P>Lin pointed out that her school conducts research on the impact of sex among
humans. The scope of the research includes sex education, sex therapy, sex

year for a project to subsidize 1,000 local elementary and junior high schools,
MOE officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>The announcement came after Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng kicked off the

      <P>Fishing subsidies for purposes of environmental protection and marine resource
conservation should be allowed, while subsidized fishing operations should be
prohibited, officials from the Fisheries Agency under the Council of Agriculture
said Monday.</P>
      <P>The officials made the remarks after Taiwan was labeled as one of the world's

to a comprehensive ban on government subsidies to fishing fleets at the World
Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Japan and South Korea also strongly opposed the ban at WTO negotiations recently
held in Geneva, Switzerland, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese representatives will continue to explain Taiwan's stance on the issue
to the international community, the officials stated.</P>
      <P>Taiwan provides far fewer fishing subsidies than Japan and South Korea, the
officials stressed, adding that Taiwan ranks 20th in the world and 11th in Asia
in terms of government subsidies for fishing operations, while globally, Japan
is in first place and South Korea in 12th.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER TAIPEI MAYOR'S CORRUPTION TRIAL OPENS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 3 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said he had not intended to embezzle public
funds and expressed the hope that justice will vindicate him as the first court
hearing on his corruption trial opened at the Taipei District Court Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ma was indicted Feb. 13 for allegedly embezzling NT$11.17 million (US$338,500)
from a special allowance fund designated for his discretionary use while serving
as Taipei mayor from 1998 to 2006.</P>
      <P>Ma, as well as Yu Wen, a secretary of the Taipei City Government, appeared at
the court as defendants in the case.</P>
      <P>Outside the court, there were clashes between Ma's supporters and opponents.
Scores of Ma's supporters shouted slogans such as "justice returns innocence to
Ma" and "fair trial, " while Peter Wang, convener of the pro-independence 908
Taiwan Republic Campaign, questioned the different treatment given to different
individuals under the judicial system, calling Ma names for insisting on running
in next year's presidential election.</P>
      <P>When asked by presiding judge Tsai Shou-shun how they plead, Ma responded by
saying: "I have done nothing wrong, " while Yu pleaded not guilty.</P>
      <P>Ma said that he had considered that the half of the "special allowance fund"
that went directly into his bank accounts and for which only receipts were
required for reimbursement purposes were not public funds, but instead of the
nature of subsidies for local government heads as is customary for more than
6,000 ranking officials around the country.</P>
      <P>Ma said that he had never personally handled the reimbursement process of the
special allowance fund and that he had not intended or acted to do things
illegally.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Hou Kuan-jen said in the indictment that Ma received NT$10.23 million
in special allowances during his first term from December 1998 to December 2003.</P>
      <P>However, expenditure records from Ma's bank accounts show that he spent only
NT$3.49 million of that amount and failed to return the unspent portion --
NT$6.74 million -- to the national coffers, Hou continued.</P>
      <P>From January 2004 through July 2006, Ma used NT$630,000 of the NT$5.06 million
fund and kept the remaining NT$4.43 million in his account, according to Hou.</P>
      <P>Hou contended that the unspent money during Ma's two terms, totaling NT$11.7
million, should be considered as "gains from embezzlement."</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT FACES TOUGH TASK AHEAD AS LEGISLATIVE CANDIDACY REGISTRATION ENDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 3 (CNA)
04/03/07  13:22:27
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has a critical task ahead with the closure
of candidacy registration for party nomination for the year-end legislative
elections, analysts said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>As many electoral districts saw more than one aspirant register for party
nomination for the "single-member constituency" legislative elections, analysts
said KMT executives will have a hard time choosing the party's candidates for
those areas while maintaining party harmony and unity.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Wu Duen-yi said the party central will do its best to
choose the candidates with the best prospects through mediation. For those
districts where negotiations fail to produce a candidate, he said, an
institutionalized mechanism for selecting a candidate will be employed.</P>
      <P>"The mechanism can either be a series of public opinion polls or public opinion
polls plus a vote by party members," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Initial tallies show that Taipei City's third district as well as Hsinchu City
and the "plains Aborigines" community will be the most hotly contested areas,
with four contenders vying for the KMT's nomination to represent the party.
Seven other areas have three hopefuls competing for the party's nomination.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  five of the incumbent KMT legislators -- Chou Shou-hsun, Chiu Yi,
Joanna C. Lei, Chang Li-shan and Lin Nan-sheng -- didn't register for the party
primaries.</P>
      <P>Among them, Chou is likely to be drafted by the KMT to run in Taipei City's
Tatung-Shihlin district, which has traditionally been a stronghold of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Chiu, a controversial lawmaker from the southern port city of Kaohsiung,  didn't
register  mainly because  he will soon be incarcerated for his role in a violent
protest at the Kaohsiung District Court back in 2004.</P>
      <P>Lei reportedly has dropped her re-election bid because she does not want to
compete against a KMT colleague in the same district in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Chang, a first-term lawmaker from southern Yunlin County, didn't register
because she has yet to decide whether she wants to run for re-election, and Lin
from the southern city of Tainan said he didn't register primarily due to his
"reluctance to sabotage party unity."</P>
      <P>The year-end legislative elections will mark the first time that a"single-member
constituency,  two votes" electoral  system is introduced. As the number of
legislative seats will be nearly halved from the current 225 to 113 under the
new system, competition within major parties and between parties in the
elections is expected to be intense.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Wu said the party headquarters plans to draft Chou Shou-
hsun to run in Taipei City's Tatung-Shihlin district as he is believed to have
the best chance of defeating the ruling DPP's candidate. As five other KMT
members have registered for the party primary in the district, Wu said mediation
is needed to pave the way for Chou's entry into the race in the district.</P>
      <P>"We are hopeful that the mediation can succeed so that the process can serve as
a model for other electoral districts to emulate," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Under the new electoral system, Wu said, it is imperative that a single party
hopeful runs for a single regional seat in each constituency.</P>
      <P>"We should pull out all the stops to prevent defeated contenders in the party
primaries from running on their own because a split vote among our grass-roots
supporters would result in victory for someone else," Wu said.</P>
      <P>As to whether any KMT primary loser is likely to quit the party and run under
the DPP banner, Wu said the possibility is very low, if not nil.</P>
      <P>"The DPP would only welcome those who can win in the general elections. At the
moment, only one of our legislators, Lee Sen-zong, meets such a prerequisite,
and just barely," he observed.</P>
      <P>Besides mediating among KMT aspirants, Wu acknowledged that the party must
simultaneously give priority to consultations with its "pan-blue" ally -- the
People First Party (PFP).</P>
      <P>Legislative sources said mediating to produce a single "pan-blue" candidate in
certain areas will be a tall order, particularly in Taichung  County's  Tali
constituency  and  Kaohsiung  City's Tsoying-Nantzu district.</P>
      <P>While PFP executives  prefer to field a single "pan-blue" candidate in disputed
areas, the sources said, their counterparts would like to resolve the disputes
by holding public opinion polls or some other mutually acceptable way.</P>
      <P>"Anyway, working out a compromise will be a tough test of both sides' political
wisdom and willpower, " said a KMT official who preferred anonymity.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Legislator Wu Yu-sheng said he believes that if the proposal to
hold the next legislative elections simultaneously with the presidential
election early next year is adopted, the possibility of "pan-blue" legislative
hopefuls running on their own without the party's endorsement will be lower,
because the general political atmosphere in such a scenario would favor unity
instead of division.</P>
      <P>"The trend will be even more evident if former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou is
formally nominated to represent the 'pan-blue alliance' in the next presidential
election," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY KICKS OFF</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition  Kuomintang's presidential primary formally kicked off
Tuesday,  with former chairman Ma Ying-jeou being the first one to send someone
to pick up a registration form.</P>
      <P>Ma, who appeared at the Taipei District Court as a defendant in a corruption
trial the same day, was unable to pick up the registration form himself. Nine
KMT city councilmen, including such mavericks as Lin Yi-hua and Wu Chih-kang,
came on his behalf.</P>
      <P>The nine councilmen arrived at the KMT headquarters at 9:09 a.m., an auspicious
time as the number nine is considered lucky in Chinese culture and the "Jeou" in
the former Taipei mayor's name means "nine" in Chinese.</P>
      <P>According to the primary process promulgated by the KMT, all aspirants can pick
up forms from April 3-5 and register from May 19-22. Those who take part in the
presidential primary have to put forward a deposit of NT$7 million (US$212,000)
. The aspirants must pay NT$2 million when they pick up the forms, and the money
will not be returned even if the aspirants do not register.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, the other possible KMT presidential
aspirant, said Monday that he will not run in the KMT's primary for the 2008
presidential election because the party's rules are custom-made to cater to a
"certain individual" and therefore cannot ensure a fair contest.</P>
      <P>Wang, a former KMT vice chairman, made the announcement one day after Ma said he
will run in the next presidential election even if he is convicted of corruption
in the first trial.</P>
      <P>Ma was indicted Feb. 13 on charges of embezzling NT$11.17 million from a special
allowance fund budgeted for his discretionary use during his term as Taipei
mayor from 1998-2006.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang reiterated Tuesday that he is willing to accept President
Chen Shui-bian's mediation of a ticket for the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) for the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>"So long as the DPP unity can be maintained, I will accept whatever approach
adopted by Chen in mediation," Su said, adding that he is open to Chen's
mediation.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks during an interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan
when he was asked about the result of the poll published by the United Daily
News earlier the same day. The poll shows that former Premier Frank Hsieh's
approval rating has surged since the party's four bigwigs -- Su, Hsieh, Vice
President Annette Lu and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun -- formally registered their
bids last month.</P>
      <P>"We have conducted our own public opinion polls, and the results are different,"
Su said.</P>
      <P>However, he added that "we'll attached importance to all kinds of views and use
them for reference."</P>
      <P>The result of the public opinion poll showed that Hsieh is leading among the
four DPP contenders bidding to represent the party in next year's presidential
election.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, Hsieh's approval rating among all eligible voters stands
at 26 percent, surpassing Su, whose rating is 23 percent, for the first time.</P>
      <P>The gap between the two widened to 10 percentage points among voters excluding
those in favor of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) or People First Party (PFP)
with approval rating for Su standing at 20 percent and rating for Hsieh standing
at 30 percent. Both Lu and Yu trailed far behind Su and Hsieh in the March
30-April 1 poll on all eligible voters or on voters excluding KMT or PFP
supporters.</P>
      <P>Su said that if he wins the right to represent the DPP in next year's
presidential election, he is willing to invite any of the other three aspirants
to serve as his running mate.</P>
      <P>He said that he will choose someone who will "take care of Taiwan's interests"
and help form a ticket that has the best chance of winning the election.</P>
      <P>However, Su stopped short of saying that he would serve as a running mate if any
of the other aspirants  win the party's nomination, only mentioning that "as a
party member, I'll definitely stump for the nominee."</P>
      <P>He said that the most urgent task is to take care of Taiwan's sovereignty and
security and to continue to develop the economy as well as a fairer and more
just society.</P>
      <P>Su said he envisions "making Taiwan better, warmer and more just, " and not
"jockeying for major posts at the expense of principles."</P>

prolong the current child care courses at public elementary schools for the need
of working parents who are unable to look after their children after the school
day ends, it will respect each school administrations' decision on whether to
extend their after-school care.</P>
      <P>The department is informing all concerned schools around the city of the new
measure, Wu added.</P>
      <P>Wu made the announcement at a press conference held by the Federation of Parents
Associations in Taipei City at the city hall. The group suggested that as the
number of double-income families and single-parent families has been on a rise
in the city, the municipal government should work to create a safe environment

      <P>The state-owned CPC Corp, Taiwan and Libyan National Oil Corp. (NOC) has signed
an exploration and production sharing agreement to tap an oil field in the North
African nation, CPC officials announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Officials said that CPC Chairman Pan Wen-yen signed the agreement in Libya
Monday, which they said will help the company's bid to set up a bridgehead for
oil exploration in North Africa.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that Libya is a major oil-producing country in North Africa
and the CPC in recent years has been actively soliciting chances to explore the
Libyan oil fields. It won the bid to explore Murzug 162 in southern Libya last
December.</P>
      <P>Officials noted that the CPC is planning to invest US$34 million over the next
three years to drill three exploratory wells and conduct explorations. If this
proves successful, it is estimated that the oil reserves could yield 500 million
oil barrels.</P>
      <P>According to the agreement, the first-stage will require five years for
exploration and if no oil is found during that period, then the CPC will have to
forfeit exploration right of the oil field, but if oil is found, then the
development and production period will continue 25 years.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has vowed to help the local automobile
industry integrate information technology to boost the industry's added value

      <P>The Taipei-based Taiwan Association of University Professors (TAUP) urged
Tuesday the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to produce its candidate
for the presidency in a democratic way and refrain from "designating a
successor" to President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>TAUP Chairman Tsai Ting-kuei made a call at the TAUP-held press conference while
expressing the association's concern over the outcome of the 2008 presidential
election, which Tsai said will decide Taiwan's future development.</P>
      <P>Four aspirants are vying for the DPP candidacy for the next presidency: Vice
President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun, and
former Premier Frank Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Tsai expressed hope that President Chen would not designate a successor, and
suggested the DPP redesign its primary system. He suggested that the party put
forward a policy issue for national debate and push for a referendum on such
policy issue whenever it is seeking a candidate for a major election.</P>
      <P>Tsai further suggested that the DPP invite those who endorse its referendum
proposals to join the party primary vote.</P>
      <P>Tsai said he believes that this candidate selection approach can also help the
DPP realize its goal of holding referendum on certain critical issues, such as
forcing the main opposition Kuomintang to return its ill-gotten assets to
national coffers.</P>

      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Tuesday that he has agreed to accept Government
Information Office (GIO) Minister Cheng Wen-tsang's resignation over his
disputed role in a share release case involving Taiwan Television Enterprise
(TTV).</P>
      <P>Su said that he decided to accept Cheng's resignation after reading through an
investigative report by Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen on the contentious case that
has drawn flak from opposition lawmakers who blasted Cheng for seeking to
pressure an executive of Japan's Fuji TV network to sell that company's shares
in the TTV to a local investor during a Jan. 17 dinner banquet in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Sumio Hasegawa, a Fuji TV representative, in a news conference last Sunday
accused Cheng of attempting to persuade him to sell Fuji's holding of TTV shares
to the Taipei-based Liberty Times Group, which Cheng claimed is Fuji TV's best
choice for the newspaper's good relations with the Democratic Progressive Party
government.</P>
      <P>"It was indeed improper for Cheng to host the dinner banquet," Su acknowledged,
but he added that "Cheng did not mean to intervene in the matter, which is
evident in that the Japanese TV company did not sell its TTV shares to the
Liberty Times."</P>
      <P>The Fuji TV network eventually sold its TTV shares to a private company set up
by former TTV Chairman Lai Kuo-chou, who was dismissed from the post in March.</P>
      <P>According to Su, Cheng tendered his resignation Monday out of concern that the
Cabinet's image might be affected due to his controversial role in the case.</P>
      <P>The premier said that he was reluctant to accept Cheng's resignation and praised
his efforts and hard work over the past one-plus year.</P>
      <P>However, Su failed to answer reporters' questions touching on who will replace
Cheng.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, no one in the government has been found to exploit an
official capacity or government policy to force Hasegawa or anyone else to make
any decision regarding anything during the banquet, in which Minister of
Economic Affairs Steven R. L. Chen and Liberty Times representatives were also
present.</P>
      <P>"It is apparent that Fuji TV was not been affected by Cheng as it sold its
holding of TTV shares to a private company,"  Tsai pointed out.</P>
      <P>Fielding  questions  from  opposition  lawmakers  during  a question-and-answer
session earlier the same day in the Legislative Yuan, Su denied that he was
aware of the Jan. 17 banquet beforehand, and ruled out allegations that he gave
Cheng a free hand to handle the TTV shares case saying that he did not instruct
Cheng to host the banquet.</P>
      <P>Su said that he has read through a report made by the Executive Yuan on the
controversy and stressed that he will render a fair judgment after acquiring a
full understanding of the event. ENDITEM/jnc</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 3 (CNA)
04/03/07  21:22:11

    <TEXT>
      <P>The prosecutor who indicted former Taipei mayor Ma Ying-jeou on embezzlement
charges said Tuesday that Ma admitted knowing, while being arraigned, that the
"special allowance fund" for the local government head is a "public fund."</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Hou Kuan-jen made the remarks after the first court hearing of Ma's
corruption trial ended at the Taipei District Court after three hours.</P>
      <P>Outside the court, scores of Ma's supporters and opponents clashed as policemen
tried to separate them, with some cheering Ma on while others derided him.</P>
      <P>Ma said during the court hearing that he always thought that half of the
"special allowance fund" went directly to his bank accounts required only
receipts for reimbursement and were not "public fund, " but a personal subsidy
extended to local government heads, to which he, well as to more than 6,000
ranking officials around the nation, was entitled.</P>
      <P>But Hou noted that when first arraigned last November 14, Ma did admit that the
special allowance was a "public fund" that should be used for official duties.</P>
      <P>If Ma had any doubts about this point, he should ask the panel of judges at the
Taipei District Court for a video tape of the arraignment.</P>
      <P>Presiding judge Tsai Shou-shun asked Ma and Yu Wen, a secretary of the Taipei
City government and another defendant in the case, how they pleaded. Ma said
that he had no intention to do anything illegal as the prosecution alleged,
while Yu pleaded not guilty.</P>
      <P>Ma contested that Prosecutor Hou did not go deep enough to learn the nature of
"special allowance fund," saying that whether the money is properly defined as
public funds or a private subsidy is not yet unequivocally clear, that this
point is important to reaching a conclusion as to the question of his alleged
corruption, and that the lack of clarity constitutes a "major flaw" on the part
of Prosecutor Hou.</P>
      <P>Ma said that during his two terms as mayor between 1998 and 2006, he executed
numerous budgets amounting to more than NT$260 billion, and he couldn't possibly
know the details of each budget project.</P>
      <P>He noted that he had never handled the reimbursement of the "special allowance
fund, " which was left for the cashiers at the Taipei City Government.</P>
      <P>He was never told to deplete the fund or return the unused portion, and that
before the probe on the case, he had never read related interpretations
concerning the use of the "special allowance fund." He was "completely in the
dark about the fund use, " and had not "deliberately" embezzled the fund as
alleged by the prosecution.</P>
      <P>Ma also said that during his public service over the past two decades, he had
donated NT$68 million to public charity, far exceeding the amount the
prosecution believes he has embezzled.</P>
      <P>The Global Views Weekly, a prestigious magazine in Taiwan, rated him as the No.
1 local government chief in terms of integrity in assessing the city and county
chiefs in Taiwan, Ma said, adding that he has been proud of his clean record.</P>
      <P>Presiding judge Tsai Shou-shun set the next court hearing for April 17.</P>
      <P>Ma was indicted Feb. 13 on charges of embezzling NT$11.17 million (US$338,500)
from a special allowance fund designated for his discretionary use while he
served as Taipei mayor from 1998 to 2006.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Hou said in the indictment that Ma received NT$10.23 million in
special allowances during his first term of office, December 1998-December 2003.</P>
      <P>However, expenditure records from Ma's bank accounts show that he spent only
NT$3.49 million of that amount and failed to return the unspent portion --
NT$6.74 million -- to the national coffers, Hou continued.</P>
      <P>From January 2004 through July 2006, Ma used NT$630,000 of the NT$5.06 million
fund and kept the remaining NT$4.43 million in his account.</P>
      <P>Hou contends that the unspent money during his two terms, totaling NT$11.17
million, should be considered "gains from embezzlement."</P>

      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu has vowed to continue
improving relations between the United States and Taiwan after assuming the post
of Taiwan's representative to the U.S.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks as he received a delegation consisting of California State
Assembly leaders at his office Monday.</P>
      <P>Wu thanked the assembly for passing a resolution in 2004 in support of Taiwan's
bid to join the World Health Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>Wu said that many Taiwanese elites received a higher education in the U.S. and
therefore have special feeling towards the country.</P>
      <P>Noting that both Taiwan and the U.S. benefit from their traditional friendship,
Wu said that he will continue to strengthen bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that China often uses a carrot-and-stick tactics against
Taiwan, making goodwill gestures while at the same time deploying missiles and
submarines to target Taiwan, he stressed.</P>
      <P>This year, China has increased its defense budget by 17.8 percent over last
year, Wu said, adding that the expansion of Chinese military power poses a
threat to Taiwan as well as to security in the Asia Pacific region.</P>
      <P>In recent years, Beijing has spared no efforts in blocking Taiwan's
participation in international organizations, including the United Nations and
the WHO, he noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is often unfairly and unjustly treated when engaging in many
international  activities  hosted  by  non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and
private sector due to China's intervention, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  recent moves to replace  the names of state-run enterprises bearing
the term "Chinese" or "China" with "Taiwanese" or "Taiwan" has raised concerns
internationally, Wu stated.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the international community remains silent when Beijing asked
organizers of many international events to force Taiwanese participants to drop
the official title of Taiwan -- the Republic of China -- Wu said, stressing that
this is not fair to democratically governed Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The soon-to-be signed free trade agreement (FTA) between the United States and
South Korea will have an estimated US$2 billion impact on Taiwan, which is
equivalent to about 5 percent of Taiwan's total exports, a spokesman of the
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The U.S. and South Korea reached an agreement on the free trade pact Monday, and
U.S. President Bush has sent the agreement to the U.S. Congress for approval.
Once signed, the U.S.-Korea FTA is expected to increase the value of trade
between the two countries by tens of billions of dollars for both sides and help
invigorate South Korea's economy.</P>
      <P>The CEPD spokesman said the estimated US$2 billion impact comes from items
exported by both South Korea and Taiwan to the U.S., adding that the government
will keep an eye on other possible impacts such as a loss of export orders and
foreign investment.</P>
      <P>The preliminary estimate was research made by the Chung-Hua Institution for
Economic Research at the request of the CEPD.</P>
      <P>According to the research, many of South Korea's bulk quantity exports, such as
automobiles to U.S. will not directly influence the exports of Taiwanese firms,
as South Korea exports whole vehicles, while Taiwan exports mainly auto parts.</P>
      <P>A spokesman of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said the U.S.-South Korea
FTA will have less influence on Taiwan's information</P>
      <P>technology industry, but might prompt American investors to</P>
      <P>consider South Korea a better investment environment than Taiwan,</P>
      <P>adding that MOEA hopes for a breakthrough in signing a free trade</P>
      <P>agreement with the U.S. in the near future.</P>

      <P>The resignation of Cheng Wen-tsang as Government Information Office (GIO)
minister cannot help clarify his role in a controversy regarding the sale of
shares in Taiwan Television Enterprise (TTV), opposition lawmakers claimed
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lee Hung-chun, spokesman for the opposition People First Party (PFP) , made the
comments after Premier Su Tseng-chang approved Cheng's resignation. Lee voiced
the PFP's doubts as to why the Executive Yuan failed to quickly punish Cheng
after the contentious case was brought to light late last month.</P>
      <P>Sumio Hasegawa, a representative of Japan's Fuji TV network, accused Cheng, in a
news conference held March 25, of trying to persuade him to sell the TTV shares
that his company held to the local Liberty Times during a Jan. 17 dinner banquet
in Taipei. Minister of Economic Affairs Steven R. L. Chen and Liberty Times
executives were also present in the gathering, he said.</P>
      <P>Sumio expressed his surprise that a Taiwanese government official could meddle
in such a commercial  matter  and said Cheng's interference would be called a
"scandal" if this were to occur in Japan.</P>
      <P>Arguing that Cheng's voluntary resignation did not clarify nor bring an end to
the matter, Lee demanded that Cheng provide a full explanation of why he feted a
person involved in the proposed sale at the banquet.</P>
      <P>Despite Su's approval of Cheng's resignation earlier in the same day, Lee said,
it remains difficult to explain the controversial case to the public. He also
accused Su of being forced to dismiss Cheng out of mounting public pressure.</P>
      <P>Should the Executive Yuan fail to clear up the matter, the PFP will thoroughly
oppose the release of government-owned TTV shares, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Hsu Shao-ping, legislative caucus whip of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT),
and KMT Legislator Joanna C. Lei, insisted that Su remove Cheng and that the
government halt its planned release of TTV shares until all suspicious aspects
of the case have been clarified.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Su's approval of Cheng's departure, Hsu said that such a
development was expected by the KMT's legislative caucus, but they questioned
why Minister Chen has not also been disciplined.</P>
      <P>Although Cheng has to assume most of the fault for the case, Hsu said that
Minister Chen also must assume responsibility for his share of the wrongdoing.</P>
      <P>Hsu concluded that the party will wait and weigh its next move as a group of KMT
legislative caucus members have filed suit against Su and Cheng for neglect of
duty, and the party wants to see what punishment Su will mete out to Chen.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Justices Say E.P.A. Has Power to Act on Harmful Gases

In one of its most important environmental decisions in years, the Supreme Court
ruled on Monday that the Environmental Protection Agency has the authority to
regulate heat-trapping gases in automobile emissions.

The court further ruled that the agency could not sidestep its authority to
regulate the greenhouse gases that contribute to global climate change unless it
could provide a scientific basis for its refusal.

The 5-to-4 decision was a strong rebuke to the Bush administration, which has
maintained that it does not have the right to regulate carbon dioxide and other
heat-trapping gases under the Clean Air Act, and that even if it did, it would
not use the authority.

Wall Street Journal: Court Rulings Could Hit Utilities, Auto Makers

In a decision that could mark a turning point in the national debate over
climate change, a divided Supreme Court ruled that carbon dioxide and other so-
called greenhouse gases are air pollutants under the Clean Air Act, and that the
Bush administration broke the law in its refusal to limit emissions of those
gases.

The 5-4 decision was a victory for environmental groups, which had pushed for
such a ruling, and a blow to the nation's auto and utility industries, among
others, as well as the White House. The Bush administration has steadfastly
opposed mandatory curbs on the emission of greenhouse gases, which most
scientists believe contribute to global warming.</TEXT>

      <P>More than 100 firefighters,  police officers  and military personnel have been
mobilized for the search and rescue mission. They braved inclement weather to
search for the missing throughout Tuesday night. Helicopters from the National
Airborne Service Corps joined the search mission at 6 a.m. Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The chopper from the Army's Airborne and Special Operations Command took off
from the Kueijen air base in southern Tainan County at 3: 52 p.m. Tuesday for an
airborne surveillance drill. It lost contact eight minutes later and the
military received a report of its crash at 4:30 p.m.</P>
      <P>The deceased officers were all from an army airborne cavalry brigade, one of the
country's most elite military units. Among them were Col. Chen Ming-tung, head
of the Airborne Cavalry Brigade 601 who was known for his diligence and was
expected to be promoted to the rank of major general soon.</P>
      <P>The other four were Lt. Col. Ma Wen-pin, head of an attack battalion; Lt. Col.
Lai Yu-hung, a chief staff officer; Capt. Wu Ming-chung,  a co-pilot; and Sgt.
Maj. Luo Ming-hua, a chief technician.</P>
      <P>Military spokesman Wu Chi-fang said that although the cause of the crash has yet
to be determined, the army has grounded all of its UH-1H helicopters, pending
thorough security checks.</P>
      <P>An initial investigative report said the crash was probably caused by bad
mountain weather leading to low visibility. Analysts said the age of the
aircraft may have also be a factor.</P>
      <P>The bodies of the deceased officers were first sent to a hospital affiliated
with I-Shou University in Kaohsiung County's Yenchao township. Defense Minister
Lee Jye visited the hospital to pay tribute to the deceased and extend his
condolences to their bereaved family members.</P>
      <P>Noting that the deceased had sacrificed their lives while flying a training
mission, Lee said the military will offer the best possible pecuniary aid for
their bereaved families. Lee also said the military will continue the search for
the three missing officers.</P>
      <P>Tuesday's crash was the third mishap involving the U.S.-built UH-1H chopper
model since it was introduced into Taiwan in the early 1970s.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 27, 1974, a UH-1H crashed in Lungkang in northern Taoyuan County,
killing three lieutenant generals and leaving then-Army Commander-in-Chief Gen.
Yu Hao-chang seriously injured. Another lieutenant general on board also
sustained severe injuries in the accident.</P>
      <P>The second mishap occurred May 3, 1986 when two UH-1Hs collided in mid-air
during a military review, killing all 18 paratroopers aboard. The disaster has
come to be known as the "503 Calamity." Then-paratroop brigade chief Teng Chu-
lin, who is now the country's representative to Poland, didn't take a single day
off for three months as he insisted on accompanying the emotionally traumatized
paratroop unit in passing their darkest days following the tragedy.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Wednesday that the system of the "special
allowance funds" designated for public office holders' discretionary use is
intrinsically flawed and that the whole system needs to be overhauled.</P>
      <P>Commenting on former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou's indictment for allegedly
embezzling NT$11.17 million (US$338,500) from a special allowance fund
designated for his discretionary use while serving as Taipei mayor from 1998 to
2006, Lu said the "special allowance funds" system is a decades-old practice
that needs to be examined and revised.</P>
      <P>"It is controversial  as different  people  have used and interpreted it
differently," she said.</P>
      <P>Lu said Ma is not the only former or sitting official to have been affected by
the defective special allowance fund system.</P>
      <P>The vice president, however, offered no opinion on how the "special allowance
funds" system should be overhauled.</P>
      <P>Ma appeared at a hearing on his corruption trial at the Taipei District Court
Tuesday, during which he said he had not intended to embezzle public funds and
expressed the hope that justice will vindicate him.</P>
      <P>Stressing that he had done nothing wrong, Ma said he had considered that the
half of the "special allowance fund" that went directly into his bank accounts
and for which only receipts were required for reimbursement purposes were not
public funds, but instead of the nature of subsidies for local government heads
as is customary for more than 6,000 ranking officials around the country.</P>
      <P>Ma,  who had doubled as chairman  of the main opposition Kuomintang, resigned
from the KMT chairmanship Feb. 13 upon being indicted for allegedly lining his
pockets during his time as Taipei mayor with a special allowance fund.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has urged Italy to grant visa-free treatment to Taiwan
citizens on a reciprocal basis.</P>
      <P>Noting that Italy has been one of the world's most popular tourist destinations,
Chen said Taiwan citizens made a total of 215,000 visits to Italy last year.</P>
      <P>Given the fact that Taiwan has long offered 30-day, visa-free entry for Italian
citizens, Chen said Italy should reciprocate Taiwan's goodwill by offering
similar treatment to Taiwan citizens.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks earlier this week while receiving an Italian parliamentary
delegation headed by Cesare Campa, deputy head of a pro-Taiwan group in the
Italian congress.</P>
      <P>Expressing his gratitude for the delegation members' generous support for
Taiwan's cause both in the Italian parliament and the international arena over
the years, Chen said he is hopeful that they can continue helping to push Italy
to sign a cooperative agreement with Taiwan on avoidance of double taxation and
prevention of tax evasion to facilitate mutual investment.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan has signed such agreements with several European countries,
including Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and Sweden.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of diplomatic ties between Taiwan and Italy, Chen said Italy
approved Vice President Annette Lu's transit stop in 2002 and a similar transit
stop for him in March 2005 to attend the late Pope John Paul II's funeral.</P>
      <P>"We are grateful for the Italian government's hospitality, and it is hoped that
all of our senior officials will be able to gain easy access to visit Italy or
make transit stops there in the future, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen took the opportunity to praise the European Union for its
continued arms embargo against China. Eighteen years ago, the E.U. imposed the
arms ban after the infamous Tiananmen Massacre, in which Chinese troops brutally
crushed a pro-democracy demonstration.</P>
      <P>Although 18 years have passed, Chen said, China has made no progress in its
human rights record and has continued to suppress political dissidents and human
rights activists. In 2005, China even passed a so-called Anti-Secession Law to
create a legal basis for the use of force against Taiwan if it perceives that
the island is moving toward independence.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Chen said he takes pleasure in seeing the European Union
rightfully maintain its arms embargo against China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Most schoolchildren in Taiwan do not eat sufficient amounts of fruits and
vegetables for lunch, the Formosa Cancer Foundation (FCF) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>While the Department of Health suggests that children should eat at least three
servings of vegetables and two servings of fruit per day, an FCF survey
conducted in March found that 70 percent of elementary schools provide only 0.5
servings or less of vegetables in their prepared lunches for students.</P>
      <P>Worse still, the survey found, 75 percent of students at these elementary
schools do not eat the full portion of vegetables served to them, said Lai Chi-
ming, executive director of the FCF.</P>
      <P>The FCF conducted the poll from March 1-16, interviewing teachers and
nutritionists from 301 elementary schools randomly chosen around the island.</P>
      <P>The poll found that less than 10 percent of the surveyed schools provide their
students with fruit in every lunch meal, while nearly 70 percent of the schools
provide fruit in only one or two lunch meals per week.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that many schoolchildren seldom finish the school lunches
served to them, with the reasons mentioned including "not having time to eat
fruit," "the lunches are not tasty," and "the servings are too large."</P>
      <P>About half of the students at the surveyed schools were found to have grown fond
of packed lunches sold outside the school, according to Lai.</P>
      <P>Lai attributed this to the fact that boxed lunches sold by vendors or
restaurants outside the school are higher in fat content and usually very spicy,
which he said students find attractive.</P>
      <P>Nearly 60 percent of the teachers at the surveyed schools said they think that
most students make unhealthy choices for lunch, which Lai said could be one of
the reasons behind the growing obesity problem among schoolchildren.</P>

      <P>Lawmakers of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) criticized Wednesday a plan to
relocate five Cabinet units from Taipei City to Hsinchuang in Taipei County,
northern Taiwan, while the plan triggered a strong protest from Kaohsiung Mayor
Chen Chu.</P>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Lee Yi-yang told the Legislative Yuan in a briefing the
previous day that a preliminary plan has been worked out to relocate the Council
of Labor Affairs (CLA), the Department of Health, the Council for Hakka Affairs,
the Council of Indigenous Peoples, and the Public Construction Commission to
Hsinchuang.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Huang Chao-shun said at a press conference held at the
Legislative Yuan that the plan shows the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration has no intention of carrying out its proposal to relocate the
capital city to southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>While mentioning that Chen had promised during her mayoral election campaign
last December to do her utmost to push for the relocation of the CLA to the
southern port city, Huang urged the mayor to stand up and fight for her promise
to be realized.</P>
      <P>At Kaohsiung City Hall, Chen, who initiated the idea to relocate the CLA to
Kaohsiung while serving as CLA chairwoman, expressed her strong opposition to
the central government's relocation proposal while pledging to fight for her
cause.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the legislative caucus of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union

geographic and functional concerns.</P>
      <P>TSU caucus whip Tseng Tsang-teng questioned why the government doesn't want to
move the CLA and the National Council on Physical Fitness and Sport to
Kaohsiung, when the southern city has the highest number of industrial workers
in the country and as Tsoying in the city is famous for producing national

      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) is planning to include village and borough
heads, their aides, as well as residential building doormen as "notifiers" who
can work to help police in cases of child abuse, MOI officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Based on concerns that the number of child abuse cases has continued to rise,
the MOI plans to increase the number of people who can help monitor and inform
the police and other related agencies of suspected cases, MOI officials said.</P>
      <P>In addition to medical professionals, social workers and nursery workers, who
are "responsible" for notifying police and hospitals upon the discovery of a
case of child abuse, MOI officials said, village and borough heads, their aides,
as well as doormen of residential buildings will probably be asked to become
"notifiers" since these particular groups of people usually have closer contact
with residents in the neighborhoods.</P>
      <P>MOI officials, however, discounted a United Daily News report Wednesday that
said that village or borough chiefs will be subject to a "heavy penalty" should
they fail to report a case of child abuse in their areas.</P>
      <P>MOI officials said that only "responsible" notifiers, namely medical

      <P>The Far East Air Transport Corp. announced Wednesday a second wave of air fare
cuts, although the cuts will not be as great as those in the first wave.</P>
      <P>Trans Asia Airways announced that it would follow suit, cutting air fares next
week at the earliest, while Mandarin Airlines and Uni Airways Corp. said that
they will act after observing market response.</P>
      <P>Far East Air Transport officials said that the price cut will be limited to
Taipei-Kaohsiung and Taipei-Tainan flights between Mondays and Thursdays.</P>
      <P>Between April 9 and May 31, air fares on the Taipei-Tainan route, between 9 a.m.
and 5 p.m. will be cut by 19 percent to around NT$1,588 (US$48). Air fares for
Taipei-Kaohsiung flights after 6 p.m. will be cut to NT$1,688, or around 24
percent discount.</P>
      <P>The officials said that all discount air fares will have to be booked via the
Web site of the Far East Air Transport or an on-site travel service operator
www.ezfly.com.</P>
      <P>Far East announced its first wave of discount air fares last month,  saying
that  passengers  ordering  air  tickets  for Taipei-Kaohsiung on Saturdays and
Sundays via Internet, will pay NT$1,510, a nearly 30 percent discount on the
NT$2,120 ticket price. The price of a ticket on the high-speed rail system for
the same destination costs NT$1,490.</P>
      <P>The air fare for a Taipei-Tainan route will be cut to NT$1,350 from NT$1,960,
making it the same price for the high-speed rail system, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Far East officials  said that the first wave of discount promotions has borne
positive results, raising the average occupancy rate on weekends by around 25
percent.</P>
      <P>Whether the first wave of air fare discounts, targeting tourists, will be
extended remains to be seen, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Faced with the steep competition from the 345-km high-speed rail system which
was inaugurated early this year, all air carriers have resorted to air fare cuts
on long-haul routes. The high-speed rail system reduces the travel time between
Taipei and Kaohsiung to 90 minutes from the previous four hours and half.</P>

      <P>A lawmaker of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity  Union  (TSU)  questioned
whether  there  are  any irregularities involved in the state-owned CPC Corp.,
Taiwan's floating pricing mechanism.</P>
      <P>Tseng Tsahn-deng, DPP caucus whip in the Legislative Yuan, noted that since the
CPC adopted the floating pricing mechanism earlier this year, the company's
surplus has jumped to NT$3.63 billion (US$110 million) from losses of around
NT$1.36 billion in January and February.</P>
      <P>Tseng raised the question as the CPC announced that the petroleum price would be
raised by NT$0.4 per liter, and the diesel price would be raised by NT$0.7 per
liter starting Wednesday.</P>
      <P>He noted that the CPC originally listed its losses for 2007 as NT$3.42 billion,
but then adjusted its budget estimates for this year to show a surplus of
NT$14.43 billion.</P>
      <P>But Tseng also pointed out that the CPC recorded a surplus of NT$16.53 billion
in 2006, even though it wasn't yet practicing the new system.</P>
      <P>He said that he worried that the CPC has used the floating pricing mechanism to
frequently and unnecessarily adjust the oil price, adding that the real problems
of the company may lie with its "poor management."</P>
      <P>In response, CPC officials said that the floating pricing system better reflects
petroleum market fluctuations, and has helped make the company profitable.</P>
      <P>They also said that compared with neighboring countries in Asia, Taiwan still
maintains the lowest petroleum prices.</P>

      <P>The Child Welfare League Foundation laid out Wednesday its three core pursuits:
the "survival, health and safety" of Taiwan's minors, and its hope that all
youngsters will be happy and safe on Women's and Children's Day.</P>
      <P>Foundation officials urged parents to spend at least 30 minutes daily with their
children, hug them for at least three minutes every day, praise them three times
every day and listen to them for three minutes every day.</P>
      <P>Most importantly, if children are to feel secure, they must be able to access
adult assistance within three minutes, in a safe environment, if need arises,
foundation officials urged.</P>
      <P>According to a nationwide  investigation  conducted by the foundation on
Taiwanese children's human rights in 2006, the index for local children's
survival rights scored only 49 points, the worst score among all the areas
surveyed and markedly below the 60-point passing threshold.</P>
      <P>Last year, a total of 10,094 children and teenagers were reported as abused to
relevant authorities, 13 of whom died as a result of abuse and 31 of whom were
killed along with their parents in incidents of filicide-suicide, statistics
compiled by the Children's Bureau of the Ministry of the Interior showed.</P>
      <P>This means that on average, one child would be abused by an adult every 52
minutes in Taiwan, and one child would be killed every eight days, according to
the bureau's tallies.</P>
      <P>In the first quarter of this year, five children in Taiwan died from
maltreatment, nearly one-third of last year's number, foundation officials said,
expressing their grave concern that many Taiwanese children find themselves in
similar situations given that some 20 percent of children surveyed acknowledged
that they are often beaten or harshly punished by their parents.</P>
      <P>Citing the investigation's findings, foundation officials said that 46 percent
of Taiwanese children often feel upset, that 70 percent worry about infectious
diseases and a similar percentage are concerned about threats to their personal
safety, such as kidnapping. On average, one child dies from accident every 1.4
days in Taiwan, they added.</P>
      <P>Earlier the same day, opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) lawmakers asked
the government to pay greater heed and provide greater assistance to issues
pertaining to children's interests and rights at a news conference in the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Some 3.17 million Taiwanese children face safety threats stemming from poor
facilities at school, deteriorating public order, traffic disorder,  and school
yard  bullying,  in addition  to physical deficiencies,  family economic
straits,  scholastic burdens and corporal punishment.</P>
      <P>According to TSU legislative caucus whip Tseng Tsahn-deng, nationwide there are
some 40,000 local children are being raised by their grandparents, 100,000
mentally or physically retarded children, and 200,000 children being reared in
single-parent households.</P>
      <P>Last year, 6,602 sexual offenses cases involving minors under 18 years old were
reported to the authorities, and 1.28 million children were concerned that they
might be kidnapped, Tseng said, pointing out that these relatively high numbers
indicate that Taiwan children are not growing up in a safe and secure
environment.</P>

      <P>Members of the public who observe the tomb sweeping custom to pay homage to the
memory of their ancestors should take precautions  to guard against skin
infections,  a dermatologist in Taichung cautioned Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chun-yi, who runs a skin clinic, told reporters that the number of patients
he and his colleagues have treated in the past few days has increased 30
percent, with most of them suffering from infections as a result of either
sunburn or mosquito and other insect bites sustained during their tomb sweeping
trips.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, these patients have told him that they swept their ancestors'
tombs ahead of the April 5 Tomb Sweeping Day because they wanted to avoid the
traffic congestion over the long weekend.</P>
      <P>Failing to protect themselves against insects and the sun, many of them
contracted acute skin infections, developed rashes all over their bodies and
suffered from headaches, breathing difficulty, perspiration and localized
lymphadenitis.</P>
      <P>Chen said that April is the month when mosquitos and other insects thrive, and
that tomb sweepers should wear a pair of light colored trousers and a jacket to
guard against stings from mosquitos and rove beetles, plus a hat to shield
themselves from direct exposure to the sun.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'X PARTICLE' CONFIRMED AS HIGGS BOSONS</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The "X particle" observed by a U.S. laboratory has been confirmed by a trio of
researchers from Taiwan and the United States as one of the hypothetical Higgs
bosons, academic sources reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>They emphasized that the finding may not only subvert the long- exiting
"standard model" in particle physics, but also make way for the discovery of
dark matters.</P>
      <P>The results of the three -- He Xiao-gang of National Taiwan University (NTU) ,
Jusak Tandean of University of La Verne, and G. Valencia of Iowa State
University -- have been published in the renowned science journal Physical
Review Letters in its Feb. 23 issue.</P>
      <P>The X particle was first observed in 2005 at the Fermi National Accelerator
Laboratory (Fermilab) during a failed search for dark matter. The unknown
substance has puzzled physicists ever since because none of the dominant
theories is capable of accounting for its characteristics.</P>
      <P>After numerous calculations and comparisons, the trio asserted that the particle
fits all the constraints of a Higgs bosons under the "next-to-minimal super-
symmetric standard model."</P>
      <P>The "standard model" of particle physics suggested in 1974 that there should be
a series of "elementary particles, " including the boson hypothesized by Peter
Higgs in 1964. However, to date, although all other particles have been found,
the Higgs boson was yet to be discovered.</P>
      <P>Later in the 1980's,  a new theory,  the "next-to-minimal super-symmetric
standard model" was introduced, with a new assumption that there should seven
kinds of Higgs boson particles, and every elementary  particle  should  have  a
unique  counterpart,  a super-symmetric particle.</P>
      <P>Since  then,  neither  the  seven  Higgs  bosons  nor the super-symmetric
particles have been observed.</P>
      <P>He, of NTU, noted that even though they didn't find "the" standard model Higgs
boson, they found "something of even greater significance," which means that by
confirming particle X to be one of the seven Higgs bosons they cannot only
assert the existence of other Higgs bosons, but also expand the theoretical
foundations of particle physics from the standard model to the next-to-minimal
super-symmetric standard model.</P>
      <P>He added that by sustaining the next-to-minimal super-symmetric standard model
with their findings, the research on dark matter would enter a new stage --
because the theory also assumed that the dark matter should be formed by super-
symmetric particles.</P>
      <P>"If the Higgs bosons exist, the super-symmetric particles may also exist," he
predicted.</P>
      <P>He said that the physicists require still more physical evidence to sustain the
theory and that the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) project coming online in
November, and the International Linear Collider (ILC) still in the planning
stages, could reveal further evidence pointing to the existence of other unknown
particles.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) adopted Wednesday a polling format
designed to exclude voters at the other half of the political spectrum from its
primary poll for district-elected legislators.</P>
      <P>The polling reform program initiated by the DPP's Acting Chairman Trong R. Chai
was slightly modified before passing the party's Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>The DPP's primary system takes into account both telephone polls involving
general citizens and voting by party members. Chai's original proposal suggested
that the questionnaire first ask the surveyed about their party inclinations.</P>
      <P>To that question, those answering that they share political beliefs with the
DPP, Taiwan Solidarity Union or pan-green camp will be included, while those
identifying with the Kuomintang, People First Party, New Party or the pan-blue
camp will not, according to DPP sources.</P>
      <P>Chai suggested that those who identify with no any political party in the first
question be asked the second question: "Would you consider supporting the DPP's
representative if he or she is a good candidate? "and that those who answer in
the affirmative will be included.</P>
      <P>During the committee meeting, Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing said
that those who choose to identify with "others" in the first question should
have a second chance to have their opinions included.</P>
      <P>According to sources that attended the meeting, committee members reached a
consensus and agreed on the change after the party's Public Opinion Survey
Center Director Chang Yu-feng said Yang's proposal would result in the inclusion
of less than another one percent of interviewees in the district-elected primary
poll.</P>
      <P>A similar format for the DPP's presidential primary poll, aiming at excluding 30
percent of voters, was also confirmed by the committee after it passed the
party's Central Executive Committee a week earlier.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh helped market locally-produced, so-called "betel nut
coffee" in the southern city of Kaohsiung Wednesday as a means of promoting
interactions between coffee traders and local growers.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said during a promotional event for the agricultural product from Neiwuan,
Pingtung County in southern Taiwan, that he volunteered to serve as a spokesman
for "betel nut coffee" last month during a visit to Neiwuan, where he drank the
local coffee for the first time, and learned that the coffee is grown under
betel nut trees -- a method of cultivation consistent with the idea of "co-
existence" in nature.</P>
      <P>Given that the coffee, named because it is grown under betel nut trees, is as
sweet as the popular Kukeng Coffee from Yulin County, Hsieh said he wishes to
attract more local coffee lovers to buy the Neiwuan product to help increase
income of betel nut farmers in the township.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, there are tens of thousands of people producing and trading betel
nut, Hsieh said, noting that as the government no longer encourages betel nut
production after the tropical trees were found to be the prime culprit
responsible for frequent landslides on the island, so growers are not entitled
to any governmental assistant programs.</P>
      <P>Due to financial concerns, some of the farmers began to grow coffee under their
betel nut trees. "Now they are all happy to produce high-quality coffee, " said
the former premier who is running to become the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's candidate in the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Saying that Taiwan imports NT$1.7 billion (US$51 million) worth of coffee on
average each year, Hsieh said that if one-third of that coffee came from local
sources it would bring an additional NT$600 million in annual revenue.</P>
      <P>Coffee plantations cover more than 217 hectares of land in southern Taiwan,
generating an annual revenue of some NT$8.59 million.</P>

      <P>Officials from the Environmental Protection Bureau of the Tainan city government
said Wednesday that they have scooped up three metric tons of dead fish for
sanitary disposal.</P>
      <P>The officials said the heavy rains caused the untreated sewage to overflow into
the Tainan Canal, killing an estimated 10,000 fish, including milkfish, large-
scale mullet and Oreochomis.</P>
      <P>They explained that the sewage depleted oxygen reserves in the canal's water,
making it impossible for the fish to survive.</P>
      <P>The Tainan Canal was a major embarrassment for the city during the 1990s due to
the stench from sludge discharged by households into the canal.</P>

      <P>Advertisers on TVBS, a local cable TV station, are urged to suspend their
commercials for one week to give the public an opportunity to reflect on TVBS'
broadcast of a staged video, according to a statement issued by the Taiwan
Advertisers' Association.</P>
      <P>The association called on advertisers Wednesday to put on hold their TV
commercials slated to be aired between April 20-26 or transfer the commercials
to other media, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Advertisers in Taiwan should not use viewership or readership rates as the only
gauge to decide upon the placement of their advertisements, the association
pointed out.</P>
      <P>Doing so has forced local media to create sensational news stories and attempt
to scoop media rivals in order to boost their viewership or readership rates,
the association explained.</P>
      <P>Companies should also take into account social responsibility as they market
their products, the association stated.</P>
      <P>Noting that satellite and cable TV channels are scarce resources that belong to

      <P>Rapid environmental impact assessment procedures should be drawn up to allow
urgent major construction programs to proceed quickly, a Cabinet panel on
economic development suggested Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Concerned by the progress of three major construction programs -- a steel plant
invested in by the Taiwan Plastics Group and two petrochemical plants of the CPC
Corporation -- the inter-ministry panel urged the Environment Protection
Administration (EPA) to "make an overall  review of current environmental
impact assessment regulations and practices, " said Council for Economic
Planning and Development Chairwomen Ho Mei-yueh, who is a member of the panel
headed by Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen.</P>
      <P>The panel asked the EPA to come up with a report within a month for further
discussion in the panel, Ho said, adding that the report should address three
concerns.</P>
      <P>First, Ho said, the EPA should consider drawing up rapid environmental impact
assessment procedures for high priority major programs "provided that
environmental protection standards are not compromised, " she said. Ho also
stated, "Not all the cases should be treated the same."</P>
      <P>Second, according to the panel's recommendation, the range and criteria of
environmental impact assessments should be determined by the environmental
impact assessment committee at the outset and should not be changed thereafter
unless absolutely necessary.</P>
      <P>Third, cases should be referred to the environmental impact assessment committee
for a decision if no conclusion is reached through a certain number of case

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed his commitments to the United States and the
world Wednesday, saying he would never back away from promises and guarantees
made to the U.S. government and the free world.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with a visiting U.S. congressional
delegation,  headed by Congressman Lincoln Davis (D-Tenn.).</P>
      <P>Noting that maintaining peace, stability and security in the Taiwan Strait is
his administration's inescapable duty and mission, Chen said he has consistently
honored his promise with regard to this major policy goal.</P>
      <P>Chen was referring to his now famous "five noes" pledge outlined in his 2000
inaugural speech which states that so long as China has no intention to use
force against Taiwan, he will not declare Taiwan's independence, not change
Taiwan's national title or national flag, not hold a referendum on the
"independence vs. unification" issue, not enshrine the special "state-to-state"
concept in the Constitution, and not abolish the National Unification Council
and the National Unification Guidelines.</P>
      <P>The United States and the free world attach great importance to Chen's "five
noes" pledge because China has repeatedly threatened to attack Taiwan should it
seek formal independence.</P>
      <P>During his talks with the visiting U.S. congressional delegation, Chen assured
them that Taiwan will spare no efforts to beef up its military might for the
sake of maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait and safeguarding its national
security.</P>
      <P>Chen also took the occasion to renew his call for the U.S. government to sign a
free trade agreement with Taiwan for mutual benefits.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan is America's eighth largest trading partner, Chen said he is
convinced that if a Taiwan-U.S. free trade agreement deal is struck,  the two
countries would be able to further strenghthen bilateral trade and economic
cooperation based on the current basis.</P>

      <P>The wreckage of an Army helicopter that crashed into a radio tower in a remote
mountain region in southern Kaohsiung  County Tuesday  will be re-assembled  to
facilitate investigations into the cause of the crash, military sources said
Friday.</P>
      <P>All the debris of the crashed UH-1H chopper from the Army's Airborne and Special
Operations Command (ASPC) has been recovered and sent back to the Kueijen Army
Base in neighboring Tainan County for re-assembling, the sources said.</P>
      <P>The ASPC is scheduled to hold consultation meetings in the next few days to
discuss repair of the damaged radio tower owned by the police-operated Public
Radio System and compensation for owners of banana ranches destroyed in the
crash, the sources said.</P>
      <P>The flight mishap claimed the lives of all the eight Army officers aboard. Five
of the bodies were recovered at the crash site Tuesday, but rescuers didn't
locate the remaining three until Wednesday noon when they were discovered lodged
in the girders of the radio tower, which the helicopter had collided with in bad
mountain weather.</P>
      <P>The crashed helicopter's flight recorders, commonly known as "black boxes, "
have also been recovered and turned over to the investigators looking into the
crash.</P>
      <P>The crashed helicopter was manufactured in 1974.  Under a cooperation deal with
U.S.-based Bell Helicopter, the military's Aero-Industry Development Center --
the forerunner of the present-day Aerospace Industry Development Corp. -- has
built a total of 118 UH-1Hs since 1969.</P>
      <P>Despite the age of the aircraft, Defense Minister Lee Jye said after the latest
flight disaster that the fleet of UH-1H choppers is still a reliable part of the
country's airborne arsenal and suggested that the cause of Tuesday's crash was
most likely bad weather, rather than the aging aircraft.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lee said that all the remaining UH-1Hs have been grounded for
thorough safety checks. He also said a detailed investigation report about the
cause of the crash will be unveiled at a news conference next Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the minister, the family of each officer killed in the crash will
receive compensation of at least NT$15 million (US$453,360).</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Army authorities said they are hopeful that the mishap will inspire a
change in the military's arms procurement policy which tends to give top
priority to the Navy's and the Air Force's arsenal shopping lists.</P>
      <P>Army sources said the Army already came up with a plan in 1998 to replace the
UH-1Hs with new UH-60/S-70 Black Hawk helicopters developed by Sikorsky Co., but
the plan was later halted because the local agent of another U.S. manufacturer
strongly lobbied for its helicopter type.</P>
      <P>The utility helicopter replacement plan has not been resumed since that time
because the Army later decided to give priority to purchasing new Apache AH-64D
assault helicopters. However, according to opposition Kuomintang Legislator Lin
Yu-fang, the military has yet to send any budget proposal for purchasing either
new utility helicopters or assault choppers.</P>
      <P>Anyway, Army officials said they hope both legislators and members of the public
will throw greater support behind the Army's weaponry procurement projects in
the future.</P>

annual output of NT$4.92 trillion in 1995 and gradually increased to NT$7.2
trillion in 2005 -- are expected to achieve annual production totalling NT$10.59
trillion by 2015, MOEA officials said.</P>
      <P>The MOEA is pushing for the implementation of these plans given the challenges
and bottlenecks facing the industries as a result of economic globalization and
the impact of the rises of China and other developing economies, including
imbalances in workforce supply and demand; insufficient engagement in research
and development; and insufficient resources backup from the government, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>The MOEA plans will include efforts to increase subsidies, improve traditional
manufacturing industries' investment environment, help sharpen traditional
manufacturing industries' international competitiveness and accelerate these
industries' overall growth.</P>
      <P>To help traditional manufacturing industries upgrade, the MOEA will also help
train skilled workers, including those responsible for quality control; push for
QC verification and product licensing; help with  research  and  development  of
innovative  products  and technologies; provide long-term soft loans; and help
open up markets abroad, the MOEA officials said.</P>
      <P>The 18 traditional manufacturing industries that have been selected for the
upgrading program involve the production of iron and steel, auto parts, machine
tools, mechanical parts and components, industrial robots, flat panel displaying
and semiconductor equipment, metal  products,  petrochemicals,  LCD  materials,
plastics, biopharmaceuticals,  textiles,  glass,  footwear,  health foods,
furniture, pulp and paper processing, as well as printing, according to the
officials.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that with the implementation of these plans, Taiwan will become
one of the three largest machine tool producers in the world by 2015, the
world's third largest bicycle producer, and one of the top 10 petrochemical
producing countries, the officials said.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian dismissed as "fabricated" reports that he has favored a
specific individual from among the four presidential aspirants of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>The president was responding to reports by the Apple Daily, a local tabloid,
during his visit to his hometown in Tainan County.</P>
      <P>The reports said that Chen has met with DPP heavyweights over the past several
days during which he expressed the hope that they will help Premier Su more. The
reports said that this showed his formal endorsement of Su.</P>
      <P>But the president didn't say if he will continue to mediate among the four
hopefuls -- Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su, former Premier Frank Hsieh
and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office earlier termed the reports as "purely speculation." The
office said in a press release that the president has always wanted the four to
engage in a "fair" competition so as to produce a candidate that has the best
chance of winning the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>"The president will by no means have preset stance on who should represent the
DPP to run for president," the press release said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Vice President  Lu said that the reports  are "misinformation, "
adding that she believes Chen's recent meetings with legislators were aimed at
learning about the situation regarding the year-end legislative elections so as
to facilitate coordination among the legislative hopefuls.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Yu said that he has never heard that President Chen endorses Su and
that he couldn't comment on the reports.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TERMINATES CONTRACT WITH U.S. PR FIRM BGR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  5 (CNA)
04/06/07  17:07:39
(By Chiehyu Lin and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top representative in the United States, David Tawei Lee, confirmed
Thursday that the Republic of China government has terminated a contract with
U.S. public relations firm Barbour Griffith &amp; Rogers (BGR) , a year before
the three-year contract expires.</P>
      <P>Lee,  nevertheless,  stressed  that the reasons behind the earlier-than-planned
rescinding of the BGR hiring contract are not those claimed by the China Times
in a report Friday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Lee said the report was untrue particularly in its claim that his office, the
Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in Washington, D.C., has
rescinded the contract with BGR under pressure exerted by officials from the
U.S. State Department.</P>
      <P>As to what were the real "reasons, " the outgoing envoy said it's inconvenient
for him to disclose them.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan Vice President Annette Lu said Friday in Taipei that it is
essential now for the government to launch an overall review of Taiwan's hiring
U.S. PR firms to smooth U.S.-Taiwan connections.</P>
      <P>Several PR firms have been hired as part of the communications channels between
Taiwan and the United States. The PR firms major tasks include smoothing
communications between Taiwan and the U.S. Congress and government and enabling
the United States to better understand Taiwan's interest in promoting democracy,
human rights and peace at home and internationally.</P>
      <P>Tacitly referring to BGR, Lu said some U.S. PR firms are prohibitively and
unreasonably expensive to hire, adding that she has expressed her opinions on
this concern to President Chen Shui-bian as well.</P>
      <P>Lu said that U.S.-Taiwan relations have been up and down over the past several
years, although it is true that "diplomacy is an extension of a country's
domestic affairs, " adding that diplomatic work will become smoother once
domestic issues are successfully handled.</P>
      <P>Lu said the government should let the people be the government's diplomatic
backup, adding that a fully-fledged democracy with a developed and flourishing
economy is the best diplomatic weapon that a country can have, instead of
spending a fortune to hire certain individuals to lobby for Taiwan. Unconfirmed
sources have said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs signed a three-year
contract with BGR in March 2005, under which the ministry was to pay US$4.5
million to the Washington-based PR firm from 2005 to 2008 for its lobbying
efforts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RELOCATION OF FIVE AGENCIES TO HSINCHUANG A 'MISCONCEPTION': PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 6 (CNA)
04/06/07  17:29:12
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday that it is a misconception that five Cabinet
agencies, including the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) , will be relocated from
Taipei City to Hsinchuang of Taipei County under an Executive Yuan plan.</P>
      <P>Su said it is still too early to speculate whether the CLA, Department of
Health,  Council for Hakka Affairs,  Council of Indigenous Peoples and the
Public Construction Commission will be relocated to Hsinchuang, since the
administration has just begun information  collection  and investigations  to
look  into the feasibility of the relocation project.</P>
      <P>Su noted that Minister of the Interior Lee Yi-yang said recently in a briefing
at the Legislative Yuan that the administration has been pondering how plots of
state-owned land in Taipei County should be used after being taken back by the
government -- remarks that probably have been misconceived as the administration
was planning to have those five Cabinet agencies relocated to Hsinchuang.</P>
      <P>The premier quoted Lee as saying that some NT$600 million (US$18.18 million)
could be saved in rent if the state-owned land can be developed to house the
five Cabinet agencies, which are "snails without shells" -- meaning they don't
have any offices that are their own property.</P>
      <P>Lee reportedly told the legislators last week that a preliminary plan has been
worked out to relocate the five agencies to Hsinchuang after the plots of land
are retrieved.  Lee's remarks drew a strong protest from Kaohsiung Mayor Chen
Chu, who initiated the idea of relocating the CLA to the southern port city of
Kaohsiung while serving as CLA chairwoman.</P>
      <P>Expressing her strong opposition to the central government's relocation
proposal, Chen pledged to fight for her cause, saying that Kaohsiung is the most
worthy and suitable city to host the CLA as it has the largest proportion of
laborers of any city in Taiwan, with 80 percent of its residents being working
class.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP BACKS OPENING OF CAR AND HORSE RACING: PARTY CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  6 (CNA)
04/06/07  18:45:03
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Responding to a media report that the Cabinet is planning to open sports car
racing and horse racing in central and southern Taiwan, the ruling party chief
said Friday that his party will back the project as long as it stimulates local
economies and benefits the people.</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun made the comments while
answering questions from reporters after it was reported a day earlier that the
Executive Yuan is expected to allow competitive race events to be held in
central and southern Taiwan beginning in June.</P>
      <P>Chang Ching-sen, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development, told CNA Thursday that opening sports car racing and
horse racing will be a boon for seven cities and counties in central and
southern regions as well as the offshore county of Penghu, but particularly the
central Yunlin County.</P>
      <P>Car racing is likely to be opened first as it requires no revisions to existing
laws, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Pointing  out that the Executive  Yuan must  first  craft comprehensive
complementary measures to mitigate the impact of the planned opening measure on
public order and social morals, Yu said that the DPP would certainly support the
plan as long as it is beneficial to society.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative caucus whip Wang Hsing-nan said the same day that the party's
caucus in the Legislative Yuan is in favor of the idea, and contended that the
measure should be able to help revitalize local economies and strike a balance
in regional development.</P>
      <P>He opined that the government should follow the example set by Hong Kong and
Macau by allocating a certain percentage of earnings to helping minorities and
the underprivileged.</P>
      <P>Kuo Su-chun, a member of the main opposition Kuomintang's legislative  caucus,
criticized  the  DPP government  for its near-slightness in announcing the car
racing and horse racing opening policy.</P>
      <P>No wonder that the announcement stirred up public suspicion that this plan is
aimed at soliciting votes for the ruling DPP in coming elections, as the
government as yet lacks a concrete blueprint, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Over the past seven years, she said, the DPP administration has been incompetent
when it comes to bolstering Taiwan's economy because it lacks an across-the-
board stimulation package, but it now wants to bolster economic development in
central and southern Taiwan by allowing profiteering businesses.</P>
      <P>The government  has to provide the pubic with a detailed explanation of its
plans to step up law enforcement if the opening leads to a deterioration in
social order, she argued.</P>
      <P>Lee Hung-chun, spokesman for the opposition People First Party, questioned why
the Executive Yuan unveiled the policy now instead of working  with opposition
lawmakers  to delve further  into a long-stalled bill aimed at allowing the
establishment of casinos on outlying islands.</P>
      <P>Lee said that he wonders why the Executive Yuan suddenly agreed to open sports
car racing and horse racing after having long opposed the proposal to set up
casinos on offshore islands due to national security concerns.</P>
      <P>The PFP lawmaker suggested the DPP administration not go too far just to solicit
votes in the coming legislative and presidential elections.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)  legislative caucus whip Yin Ling-ying  urged  the
government  to  thoroughly  assess  all tourism-related opening issues, and
carefully gauge possible adverse effects.</P>
      <P>The government must not focus its attention only on economic benefits while
turning a blind eye to possible negative side effects, such as the deterioration
in public order, she said.</P>
      <P>Following in others' footsteps does not guarantee success if the government's
planned opening measures lack the vision to integrate local features and
characters, she argued, adding that such efforts may actually lead to greater
problems down the road.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP TO DRUM UP SUPPORT FOR REFERENDUM ON KMT'S ILL-GOTTEN ASSETS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 6 (CNA)
04/06/07  18:50:09
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun said Friday that
the party will sponsor 100 speeches around the island to drum up support for its
campaign to retrieve the ill-gotten assets of the Kuomintang through a national
referendum.</P>
      <P>Yu said at a news conference that the speeches will kick off in Kaohsiung
Saturday, on the 18th anniversary of pro-democracy activist Cheng Nan-jung's
death.</P>
      <P>In 1989, Cheng was charged with insurrection for reprinting a draft constitution
for the Republic of Taiwan. Cheng refused to appear in court, and when police
arrived to arrest him on April 7, he committed suicide by self-immolation.</P>
      <P>Yu criticized the KMT for refusing to return its ill-gotten assets to the
nation, saying that a proposed bill to retrieve ill-gotten assets of the
political party has been blocked by the opposition-controlled legislature, and
that is why the DPP has to resort to retrieval through a national referendum.</P>
      <P>He noted that the first-stage of signature-collection to make this a valid
proposal had been successful, but the campaign will need at least 830,000
signatures in the second-stage to make it to a national referendum.</P>
      <P>The DPP has set a goal of collecting one million signatures by July, but Yu
acknowledged that it is falling behind in reaching that goal.</P>
      <P>The party hopes to drum up support through the worldwide speeches, he said.</P>
      <P>As party chairmen, Yu should be responsible for soliciting 5,000 signatures, but
he said that he is willing to raise the quota by 10 times to 50,000 signatures,
urging all party members to step up their efforts and to make this their top
priority.</P>
      <P>Yu said that the DPP administration has ruled the nation for seven years, but
that public trust in the party has been compromised because a number of the
party's promises have fallen through.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that the party will stick to its guns on this matter at
least, saying that the matter depends on "will and determination."</P>

      <P>Chang Ching-sen, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development, was quoted as saying that car racing is expected to be
allowed before horse racing, and that Yulin County stands a good chance of first
benefiting from the planned opening.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the reported opening is still very far away from being realized,
Su said that the government has to craft a comprehensive program and revise laws
first.</P>
      <P>Although Yunlin County is very keen to host car racing or horse racing events,
Su said that the issue must be fully explored on the legal,  tourism,  animal
protection and gambling-related fronts in advance.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, the sentiment of the local residents on the outlying
Penghu County also must be heeded as Penghu has long sought government
permission to set up casinos. ENDITEM/jnc</P>

      <P>The Intelligent Property Office (IPO) has launched an online forum at its Web
site, inviting the public to submit their opinions on proposed revisions to
Intellectual Property Laws, an IPO official said Friday.</P>
      <P>The IPO plans to have legislation related to patent, trademark right and
copyright revised in response to the development of new technologies and changes
in the global environment surrounding intelligent property rights, according to
the official.</P>
      <P>The official said that the current Patent Law, promulgated in July, 2004, does
not allow for patents on animal or plant inventions, but a resolution passed by
the Executive Yuan's Biotechnology Industry Guidance Task force requires the IPO
to change it.</P>
      <P>While considering new developments touching on enforcement of compulsory
licenses for pharmaceutical and medical device patents, the IPO decided to
revise the Patent Law.</P>
      <P>As for the Trademark Law, although it has undergone several revisions, room
remains for improvements in the implementation of the law, and the IPO is set to
make adjustments consistent with the Trademark Law Treaty adopted by the World
Intellectual Property Organization, the official said.</P>
      <P>He added that since problems arose in November 1997 concerning Copyright
provisions in dealing with copyright agencies, the law has also been in need of
revision.</P>
      <P>The official said that to ensure that amendments to relevant laws are made more
comprehensive, the IPO will hold public hearings, forums and make relevant
documents and materials available to the general public, all in order to gather

      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng warned Friday the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) on issues related to ethnicity and its assets, suggesting that
the party must iron out response mechanisms to deal with all possible scenarios.</P>
      <P>Wang made the comments while answering questions from reporters in central
Changhua County, where he attended a seminar on preventing domestic violence
sponsored by county authorities.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the KMT faces three major thorny issues in the short term and
must ready itself for possible consequences arising from issues of ethnicity,
party assets and former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's embezzlement trial, as the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will undoubtedly rehash these issues
to secure victory in the coming legislative and presidential elections.</P>
      <P>As the DPP has been promoting a public endorsement campaign on what it called
the KMT's illegally acquired party assets in hopes of putting the issue to a
national referendum to be held along with the March 2008 presidential election,
the KMT must not sit idle. The party has to properly handle these issue in the
face of the DPP's predictable electioneering, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Additionally, Wang said, the KMT also must be wary of negative developments in
Ma's trial on corruption charges, and should set up a fast-response team to deal
with issues arising from this case.</P>
      <P>Wang, a KMT stalwart, also wished Ma the best in the party's presidential
primary, in which Wang will not be participating.</P>

      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang urged the public to keep an eye out for migrating euploea
butterflies as he inspected a migratory route used by the colorful creatures in
Linnei, Yunlin County Friday.</P>
      <P>Premier Su made the remarks during a tour of Yunlin county to attend a euploea
butterfly festival sponsored by Linnei township. Su, together with Yunlin
Country Magistrate Su Chih-feng, also promoted papaya and other agricultural
produce of Linnei township during the tour.</P>
      <P>Su later listened to a briefing by Lee Tai-ming, director general of the Taiwan
Area National Freeway Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation and

the butterflies.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that each year the butterflies pass a section of the Formosa Freeway
in Linnei,  Yunlin county on their northbound migration route.</P>
      <P>The bureau has erected protective screens -- 200 meters in length and 2.5 meters
high -- between the Jhushan and Douliou interchanges, as well as ultraviolet
lights along the Linnei section to guide the butterflies around a heavily
trafficked freeway bridge, all in a bid to preserve the good name of Taiwan as a

      <P>The Grass Mountain Chateau on scenic Ynagmingshan in suburban Taipei, which was
the late President Chiang Kai-shek's  first official residence in Taiwan,  was
partially destroyed by a fire late Friday, Taipei City government officials said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Initial investigations showed that the chateau's main exhibition hall spanning
about 660 square meters had been completely engulfed in flames in the fire,
which broke out at around 0: 20 a.m., municipal firefighting department
officials said. They added that the cause of the fire has yet to be determined.</P>
      <P>The department's Yangming outpost sent fire engines to the scene immediately
after receiving an emergency call from security guards at the chateau, the
officials said, adding that as the flames were very high, more fire gear from
neighboring Shihlin, Shihpei and Huagang outposts were sent to help put out the
fire which was brought under control at around 1:30 a.m.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, their firefighting efforts were impeded by several
factors, including a water shortage, heavy night fog, and the area's rugged
terrain.</P>
      <P>The city government has listed the 87-year-old chateau as a protected heritage
site. The chateau was built in 1920 by Taiwan Sugar Corp. in preparation for a
visit by then-Japanese Crown Prince Hirohito. Historical records show that
Hirohito stayed at the house for only one hour and 50 minutes. The chateau later
served as a spa villa for social celebrities during the period of Japanese
colonial rule.</P>
      <P>In December 1949, the Republic of China government moved its seat to Taipei, and
President Chiang Kai-shek chose to stay at the chateau,  making it Taiwan's
first presidential residence. The president and his wife lived at the house
until May 1950 when a new house was built in Taipei's Shihlin district. The
chateau later served as the first couple's summer villa.</P>
      <P>As several major government decisions were made during the Chiang's stay at the
chateau, the Taipei City government decided Dec. 19, 2002 to list the house as a
building of historical significance and officially named it the "Grass Mountain
Chateau."</P>
      <P>The building has since served as a cultural activity center that encompasses an
exhibition hall, a conference room, a performance stage, a restaurant and
reception area, and a management center. the mid-night fire mainly damaged the
exhibition hall and the restaurant and reception  area,  known  as Meilu Hall
and Yingho  Hall, respectively.</P>
      <P>Municipal police authorities have begun investigating the cause of the fire.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has arranged a birdwatching trip for
ambassadors and representatives in Taiwan, MOFA spokesman Wang Chien-yeh said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister James Huang will accompany them to the scenic Aowanda
National Forest Recreation Area in Nantou County in central Taiwan late this
month, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The ministry hopes that they will gain a greater appreciation of Taiwan's
beautiful landscape and learn more about the island's environmental protection
efforts, he added.</P>
      <P>He noted that Aowanda is famous for its autumn scenes of colorful maple trees,
adding that every March and April, it is also one of the best places in Taiwan
for birdwatching.</P>
      <P>"The diplomatic personnel will surely be impressed by Taiwan's natural beauty
during their visit to Aowanda," Wang said.</P>
      <P>He added that during their visit, they will have the chance to see Formosa
Magpie, which briefly appear in Aowanda every April.</P>
      <P>The Formosa Magpie is a leading contender to be chosen as Taiwan's national bird
in a contest being sponsored by the Taiwan Association of Sustainable Ecological
Engineering Development. The other three top contenders are the Yellow Tit, the
Swinhoe's Pheasant and the Mikado Pheasant.</P>
      <P>The MOFA arranges for diplomats and representatives to travel around Taiwan
every year, with the aim of introducing the natural beauty of the island to
foreign friends, Wang said. In recent years, trips have been arranged to the
outlying Kinmen Island and Green Island.</P>
      <P>The birdwatching trip was originally scheduled to take place at the end of
March, but because Huang visited St. Lucia during that time, the trip was
rescheduled for April 26-27.</P>
      <P>Ambassadors and representative from 25 countries are expected to join the
birdwatching trip, Wang said.</P>

      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) chairmanship by-election was held
Saturday, with over 337,000 members around Taiwan and overseas casting ballots
for one or the other of the two candidates -- former KMT acting Chairman Wu Poh-
hsiung and Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu.</P>
      <P>Honorary Chairman Lien Chan cast his ballot along with Wu and Hung.  He called
the  election  a milestone  in the party's democratization, praising the
candidates for showing respect for each other in their campaigning for the sake
of the party unity.</P>
      <P>"Both candidates have demonstrated what a decent election is, and that makes the
election significant, " Lien said, adding that regardless of who wins, the
person chosen as the new head of the party is expected to be able to push for
cooperation between former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng -- two KMT aspirants for the presidency.</P>
      <P>According to the KMT regulations, the person who wins will assume the post April
11 and serve until August 2009 when the party holds its 18th national congress.</P>
      <P>Out of concerns about a possible low turnout due to cloudy weather and a four-
day holiday, Ma urged party members to vote, while casting his ballot.</P>
      <P>The number of eligible voters in this chairmanship by-election is much lower
than that of the previous election in July 16, 2005, when 524,488 of the over 1
million eligible voters cast ballots. There are fewer eligible voters this time
around because the KMT amended its election regulations under Ma's leadership,
making only those party members who have paid their membership fees eligible to
vote.</P>
      <P>A total of 486 voting stations were set up around the country for Saturday's by-
election, with the largest located at Changho Middle School in Taipei County,
for 5,057 voters, and the smallest in Wushiu on the outlying island of Kinmen,
for 15 voters.</P>
      <P>Huang Chung-hsien, chief of the KMT organization and development department,
expressed the hope that the turnout for this by-election will be around 40
percent and thus surpass the 19 percent turnout for the chairmanship election of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party on Jan. 15, 2006.</P>

      <P>The nation's two largest air carriers are expected to see robust profit growth
after fuel price pressure eases, analysts said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Both China Airlines (CAL) and EVA Airways Corp. reported lackluster performance
last year due to soaring oil prices, although fuel price pressures began to ease
in the fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>EVA Airways's revenue for 2006 totaled NT$93.9 billion (US$2.84 billion), up 6
percent from the previous year.</P>
      <P>The second-largest air carrier reported a pre-tax profit of NT$650 million in
the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of NT$1.47 billion in the third
quarter.</P>
      <P>EVA Airways reported an after-tax net loss of NT$1.68 billion in 2006, which was
less than expected.</P>
      <P>CAL, the largest air carrier, reported revenue of NT$121.99 billion last year,
up 12 percent from the previous year. After-tax net profit was NT$738 million,
up 14.43 percent over the previous year.</P>
      <P>Analysts said that average oil prices this year are expected to be lower than
last year, which they said will ease pressure on air carriers.</P>
      <P>In addition, the prospect of more cross-strait charter flights at times other
than during the Chinese New Year, Tombsweeping Day, Dragon Boat Festival and
Mid-Autumn Festival holidays will also be a boost for the two air carriers.</P>
      <P>Analysts estimated that EVA Airways' revenue will be NT$92.14 billion this year,
with a pre-tax net profit of NT$1.09 billion, while CAL will register a profit
of NT$2.08 billion for the year.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that the planning of the Taichung Airport
should have broad vision and take into consideration prospective Chinese
tourists coming to Taiwan, according to Legislator Yang Chiung-ying of the
opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Yang,  her legislative  colleagues Kuo Chun-ming and Hsieh Ming-yuan from the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , Taichung County Magistrate Huang
Chung-sheng, as well as DPP Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung attended a briefing
for President Chen. The president, accompanied by Premier Su Tseng-chang,
inspected the Taichung Airport, which was converted from an air base.</P>
      <P>Talks with China on the opening of Taiwan to Chinese tourists for sightseeing
are reportedly in the final stage.</P>
      <P>According to Legislator Yang, the president thinks that the facilities of the
airport are still not up to par with those of international airports, that the
software and hardware equipment must be improved, and that facilities for
outbound traffic should be upgraded.</P>
      <P>Yang noted that many local people are worried that Taichung Airport, although
called an international airport, has only a very limited number of international
charter flights. Its function as a domestic airport has gradually decreased,
especially since the inauguration of the high-speed rail system early this year.
They urged the government  to help step up software  and hardware improvements
so that it will not remain an airport for only charter flights.</P>
      <P>These local people suggested an extension of a planned mass rapid transit system
line to connect it to the airport, as well as the construction of additional
runways and hangars at the airport, and the opening of cargo services to
facilitate the export of goods of manufacturers in the Central Taiwan Science
Park.</P>
      <P>According to Civil Aeronautics Administration statistics, there are around
30,000 passengers every month on domestic flights to and from the airport,
mainly going to and from Taiwan's offshore islands.</P>
      <P>On international charter flights, there are more than 40,000 passengers every
month, mainly to Hong Kong, Macau and Vietnam, according to the tallies.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) on Saturday urged youths to stay away from drugs
and practice safe sex.</P>
      <P>Lin Ting, deputy chief of the DOH's Center for Disease Control, made the appeal
amid reports that police arrested drug dealers at the annual Spring Scream music
and arts festival which kicked off early this week in the resort area of Kenting
in southern Pingtung County.</P>
      <P>Li noted that the number of young people who have been infected with HIV through
sexual activity has risen rapidly and that drug use often increases the risks of
contracting the disease.</P>
      <P>A recent survey conducted by the DOH shows that more than 20 percent of young
people who have had sexual intercourse in the past month have not practiced safe
sex.</P>
      <P>DOH statistics also show that over the past year, 394 young people between the
age of 15 and 24 were confirmed to have been infected with HIV. The number of
people infected with HIV in this age group has increased steadily in recent
years, mainly because of the practice of unsafe sex, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin said that drug dealers often use such events as the Spring Scream to sell
their goods, adding that the atmosphere at such events could lure young people
to try drugs, which he claimed often leads to unsafe sex.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian visited Taichung City, central Taiwan, Saturday with
Premier Su Tseng-chang to receive a briefing from the city government on plans
to develop the vast plot of land where the old Shuinan Airport once stood.</P>
      <P>The development project, formed after the airport facilities were relocated to
the Chingchuankang Airport in March 2004, thus leaving approximately 250
hectares of land vacant, drew Chen's attention after Richard Li, a Hong Kong
business tycoon whose father is Asia's richest man, Li Ka-shing, appeared
interested in the project during his visit to the site of the former airport
last month.</P>
      <P>Talking about the development project, Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said work on
carrying out the project has long been put off because of the problem of
covering the cost of at least NT$7 billion (US$211.64 million) of work to
relocate the Air Force second logistic command center away from the Shuinan
airport site.</P>
      <P>The Shuinan airport was built during the period of Japanese colonial rule of the
island to serve as a military airport. It was taken over after the end of World
War Two by the ROC Air Force, which established the logistic command center and
an aviation industrial development center at the airport.</P>
      <P>From that time until 1980, all Taiwan-produced aircraft were manufactured and
underwent tests at the airport, according to the city government. As Taichung
expanded,  the airport's relative location shifted from the outskirts to the
center of the city. It is now situated  near the Central Taiwan Science Park,
Fengchia University and the Aerospace Industrial Development Corp., which
designed and built Taiwan's Indigenous Defense Fighters.</P>
      <P>As the airport's existence was often blamed for hindering the city's land
traffic and urban development, the city government kicked off efforts after the
relocation of the airport facilities in 2004 to develop the place into a modern
urban center that has been planned to house a university city, a trading
exhibition center, an exclusive residential district and a forest park.</P>
      <P>After the briefing, Hu cited President Chen as saying that the central
government will do something to address the problem that has hindered the
development project from proceeding for years.</P>

A few years ago, Vonage Holdings Corp. founder Jeffrey Citron promised to

calls. Sure enough, Internet calling exploded in popularity. But Vonage is
fighting for its life.

A federal judge said Friday Vonage must stop signing up new customers unless it

ruling stopped short of shutting down service to Vonage's 2.2 million existing

      <P>Former acting chairman of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , Wu Poh-hsiung, won
Saturday's KMT chairmanship by-election by a landslide.</P>
      <P>Wu garnered 156,499 votes, or 86.97 percent of the 181,374 votes cast, beating
his only rival, Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu, who managed 23,447 votes.</P>
      <P>Wu said after the victory that he'll "do his utmost to promote party solidarity
after assuming his new post April 11."</P>
      <P>Wu also said that the "new task will be the beginning of responsibility," vowing
to promote party affairs in an "impartial manner."</P>
      <P>The new chairman will immediately face the daunting task of coordinating between
the two KMT presidential aspirants -- former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and
Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng -- in the hopes of helping the party win the
2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The other task will be coordinating among legislative hopefuls for the year-end
legislative elections, for which a new "single-member constituency and two
votes" electoral system will be adopted, under which the number of seats in the
legislature will be halved to 113.</P>
      <P>Wu, 68, was widely favored to win this election given his solid background in
politics. He has served as Taoyuan County magistrate, Taipei mayor, Minister
without portfolio, minister of the interior, secretary-general of the
Presidential Office and vice chairman of the KMT.</P>
      <P>Wu and Hung hugged each other to show the reconciliation between them after the
election. Wu also presented Hung with a birthday cake to wish her happiness, as
Saturday happened to be her birthday.</P>
      <P>A total of 337,467 KMT members around Taiwan and overseas were eligible to cast
ballots in the by-election, which became necessary after Ma resigned from his
post upon being indicted in early February for allegedly embezzling public
funds.</P>
      <P>The voter turnout rate was 53 percent, better than the estimate of 40 percent by
the KMT's original estimate in view of the inclement weather and the fact it is
a long weekend.</P>
      <P>Hung, who came to the party's headquarters to watch the vote count after the
polls closed at 4 p.m., conceded defeat before the count was finished as she
trailed by a large margin.</P>
      <P>Hung said she fared worse than she had expected, but she added that "to take
part is itself a victory."</P>
      <P>Hung said that she was not satisfied with reports which described the by-
election as a "a battle between proxies, " meaning that Ma favored Wu while she
joined the election at the urging of Wang.</P>
      <P>She said that her relations with Wu will not change after the election, pointing
out that there weren't any clashes during the campaign period, although she did
find that there are some things about the party that need to be improved.</P>
      <P>She stressed that she will not bid for an at-large seat in the year-end
legislative elections, adding that between now and December, she has several
months to think about her next step or next job.</P>
      <P>After seeing People First Party Chairman James Soong send a floral basket to Wu
at 5 p.m. to congratulate him for his victory, Hung also jokingly said that
Soong should be fair and also send her a floral basket to comfort the loser and
wish her happiness on her birthday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GRASS MOUNTAIN CHATEAU TO BE RESTORED: CITY CULTURAL CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 7 (CNA)
04/07/07  21:10:21
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The late President Chiang Kai-shek's first official residence in Taiwan, which
was badly damaged in a fire just after midnight Friday, will definitely be
restored to its past glory, Taipei City's culture chief said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lee Yung-ping, director of the Department of Cultural Affairs of the Taipei City
government, made the remarks after the Grass Mountain Chateau on scenic
Yangmingshan  in suburban Taipei was almost completely engulfed in the fire that
broke out at around 12: 20 a.m.</P>
      <P>The style of the 660-square-meter main building, on an estate covering  about
1,815 square meters,  is typical  of Japanese architecture of the 1920s. The
wall of the entrance to the main building is made of stone, with Japanese wooden
structure inside.</P>
      <P>The fire destroyed more than half of the main building, with the wooden interior
being completely burnt. The stone wall remains intact.</P>
      <P>Total damage is estimated at roughly NT$36 million (US$1.09 million) , Lee said,
adding that the municipal cultural department will invite experts and scholars
to form a special panel to investigate the extent of the damage and flesh out a
restoration plan.</P>
      <P>Noting that the city government had conducted an elaborate study on the
chateau's architectural structure and interior design before formally listing it
as a protected heritage site in 2002, Lee said she believes it won't be very
difficult to restore it to its original glory.</P>
      <P>As to the exhibits on display in its main hall, Lee said, reproduction will not
be a problem given the fact that nearly all of the items were replicas.
Nevertheless, she added that the question of what exhibits will be displayed
inside the restored building will be open for further discussion by experts and
scholars.</P>
      <P>Lee said the special panel, to be composed of three to six academics and
architectural specialists, will hold its first meeting Monday or Tuesday.</P>
      <P>As the fire happened at a time when Taipei's politicians have been squabbling
over whether to preserve the late President Chiang's legacy or wipe it out after
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) branded him as the main
perpetrator of the infamous 228 Incident of 1947, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said
he will ask municipal police officers to step up patrols in and around the
chateau as well as at other buildings dedicated to the memory of Chiang,
including the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hal, the Shihlin Domicile and the
Yangming Residence.</P>
      <P>Hau refrained from speculation about the cause of the fire, saying an
investigation team has been formed to probe why and how the blaze had broken out
in the first place.</P>
      <P>Since the chateau has been designated as a heritage site, Hau said it should not
become a target of criticism. "People of different political stripes or
affiliations should all work for preservation of cultural heritage and
historical relics." he added.</P>
      <P>The municipal firefighting department's Yangming outpost sent fire engines to
the scene immediately after receiving an emergency call from security guards at
the chateau round midnight, city officials said, adding that as the flames were
very high, more fire gear from neighboring Shihlin, Shihpei and Huagang outposts
were sent to help put out the fire which was brought under control at around
1:30 a.m.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, their firefighting efforts were impeded by several
factors, including a water shortage, heavy night fog, and the area's rugged
terrain.</P>
      <P>The city government has listed the 87-year-old estate as a protected heritage
site. The chateau was built in 1920 by Taiwan Sugar Corp. in preparation for a
visit by then-Japanese Crown Prince Hirohito. Historical records show that
Hirohito stayed at the house for only one hour and 50 minutes. The chateau later
served as a spa villa for social celebrities during the period of Japanese
colonial rule.</P>
      <P>In December 1949, the Republic of China government moved its seat to Taipei, and
President Chiang Kai-shek chose to stay at the chateau,  making it Taiwan's
first presidential residence. The president and his wife lived at the house
until May 1950 when a new house was built in Taipei's Shihlin district. The
chateau later served as the first couple's summer villa.</P>
      <P>As several major government decisions were made during the Chiang's stay at the
chateau, the Taipei City government decided Dec. 19, 2002 to list the house as a
building of historical significance and officially named it the "Grass Mountain
Chateau."</P>
      <P>The building has since served as a cultural activity center that encompasses  an
exhibition  hall,  a small-scale  showroom,  a multifunctional auditorium, a
performance area, a semi-open air coffee shop , and a management center. The
mid-night fire damaged all the exhibition hall and showrooms as well as the
coffee shop, known as Meilu Hall and Yingho Hall, respectively.</P>
      <P>The city government has commissioned the Buddhist Fo Kuang University to manage
the chateau since 2002 and the cooperation contract is scheduled to expire at
the end of June this year.</P>

      <P>The Criminal Investigation Bureau (CBI) reminded people Saturday to be aware of
the criminal activity of phishing when using the Internet.</P>
      <P>A CBI spokesman said phishers usually send e-mails with a hyperlink to a bogus
Web site falsely claiming to be that of a legitimate enterprise. Users are then
tricked into handing over their personal information, such as credit card
numbers, which the phishers then use to withdraw money from the users' accounts.</P>
      <P>There have been many victims of phantom withdrawals by phishers, the spokesman
said, adding that people have been duped out of millions of dollars in total.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that Internet users should be sure that the Web site they are
visiting is legitimate, especially if they locate the Web sites via the use of
search engines.</P>
      <P>He also reminded users not to click onto links to unknown Web sites, and not to
open emails from unknown senders. In addition, he recommended that people
regularly change their passwords and use authorized software as a precaution
against phishing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT HEAVYWEIGHTS HOPE NEW CHAIRMAN TO STRIVE FOR PARTY UNITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  April  7 (CNA)

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman  Ma Ying-jeou  expressed  the hope
Saturday that the newly-elected KMT chairman, Wu Poh-hsiung, will attach
importance to party unity and reform after assuming the post, while Legislative
Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, a KMT heavyweight, expressed the wish that Wu will
make efforts to improve the party's image.</P>
      <P>Wu won Saturday's KMT chairmanship by-election by garnering 156,000 votes. His
only rival, Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu, received just 23,000 votes. After learning
about Wu's victory during his visit to the southern county of Kaohsiung, Ma said
that he expects the chairman-elect to help the party win back power in the 2008
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Also in Kaohsiung County, Wang urged KMT members during his visit to his
hometown of Luchu Village to do their utmost to maintain the party's image,
while calling for the new leadership to reconsider a proposal to amend the
party's charter to allow the nomination of a member who is found guilty of a law
offense in a district court to represent the KMT in a major election like the
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Wang claimed the proposal, aimed at allowing Ma, who is on trial for allegedly
embezzling public funds, to join the KMT primary for the presidential election,
has triggered criticism in society.</P>
      <P>Ma was indicted Feb. 13 for allegedly embezzling NT$11.17 million from a special
allowance fund budgeted for his discretionary use during his term as Taipei
mayor from 1998-2006.</P>
      <P>Both Ma and Wang are aspirants for the KMT's nomination to represent the party
in the next presidential election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VP URGES NEW KMT CHIEF NOT TO BOYCOTT 2007 BUDGET BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 7 (CNA)
04/07/07  22:45:27
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Saturday she looks forward to seeing the main
opposition Kuomintang no longer boycott the central government's 2007 budget
bill under its new chairman.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks after Wu Poh-hsiung, a seasoned politician, won a landslide
in his party's chairmanship by-election earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Noting that a number of critical bills have been stalled in the opposition-
controlled Legislative Yuan, Lu said she keenly hopes that the Wu-led KMT will
no longer boycott the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration's policy
initiatives at every turn.</P>
      <P>The KMT and its "pan-blue alliance" ally -- the People First Party, jointly
control a slim majority in the legislature and have often blocked the Cabinet-
proposed bills from even being discussed on the legisaltive floor over the past
seven years.</P>
      <P>Lu, who is bidding to represent the DPP in the 2008 presidential election, said
it is hoped that the KMT can from now on act as the country's loyal opposition
and engage in peaceful and rational competition with the ruling DPP with
visionary policy proposals. As the first step, Lu said, Wu can help manage an
early passage by the legislature of the central government's 2007 budget bill
which should have been approved before the last legislative session ended in
late January.</P>
      <P>Responding to Singaporean Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew's recent criticism that
Taiwan's pursuit of independence and a new constitution is a dead-end that would
lead to nowhere, Lu said Taiwan has long been an independent sovereign country
and need not waste time any more on a debate over whether it should seek
independence.</P>
      <P>As to constitutional re-engineering, Lu said it's all too common in a democratic
country where the government is entitled to tailor its constitutional system to
cater to its changing political and social situations.</P>
      <P>Lu further said the drive to promote Taiwanese identity is not aimed at
confronting with China. "Instead, we treat China as a distant relative and a
close neighbor that both can benefit from peaceful engagement in various
fields,: she added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CITY COUNCILOR CALLS FOR NO HASTE IN DECIDING CHATEAU'S FATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 7 (CNA)
04/07/07  23:42:47
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition Taipei City councilor urged the municipal government Saturday to
refrain from hastily deciding to restore a badly damaged chateau "to its past
glory" simply because a late president once briefly lived there.</P>
      <P>Chien Yu-yen, a first-time councilwoman from the tiny Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) , made the remarks after Lee Yung-ping, director of the city government's
Department of Cultural Affairs, said earlier in the day that the Grass Mountain
Chateau on Yang ming shand in suburban Tipei, which was partially destroyed by a
fire just after midnight Friday, will definitely be restored since it is listed
as a protected heritage site.</P>
      <P>Chien advised Lee of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) to wait at least until
after an investigation report on the cause of the fire is completed to evaluate
whether the 87-year-old chateau should be rebuilt with taxpayers' money.</P>
      <P>While the KMT-controlled  city government  has touted  the Japanese-style
chateau as the late President Chiang Kai-shek's first official residence in
Taiwan, Chien said that to the best of her knowledge, Chiang had lived at a
villa in Tahsi in northern Taoyuan County for nearly two months after fleeing to
Taiwan from the Chinese mainland in June 1949 before moving to Grass Mountain
Chateau.</P>
      <P>During Chiang's authoritarian rule of Taiwan, Chien said, he had built more than
37 chateaus in scenic spots around Taiwan, with the exception of Granss Mountain
Chateau which was built in 1920 during the era of Japanese colonial rule.</P>
      <P>"It is worth thinking whether we should presever so many legacies of a
'dictator' whom the Democratic Progressive Party administration has branded as
the key perpetrator of the infamous 228 Incident of 1947, " Chien said, adding
that it is hoped that the municipal cultural bureau can refrain from adopting an
ideology-based approach to deal with the "heritage sites" issue.</P>
      <P>In her view, Chien said, the city government has not attached similar importance
to the preservation of the city's other cultural heritage sites, such as
Chungshan Bridge, Taiwan railway relics and Talungtung cultural relics.</P>
      <P>"The cultural affairs department should give the top priority to all city
dwellers' interest in deciding the chateau's fate and should not blindly spend
huge public funds to preserve anything related with the late dictator," she
added.</P>
      <P>The cause of the fire that engulfed the Grass Mountain Chateau's main building
is still under investiogations.</P>
      <P>The city government has commissioned the Buddhist Fo Kuang University to manage
the chateau since 2002 and the cooperation contract is scheduled to expire at
the end of June this year. Chien said whether  the university  should be held
responsible  for compensation for the fire damage also deserves a study.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT LAWMAKERS' REACTIONS MIXED TO REVISING PARTY 'EXCLUSION' RULES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 8 (CNA)
04/08/07  20:36:10
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) had mixed responses Sunday to
a proposal that the party modify a rule excluding indicted members from taking
part in any elections, with some expressing concern that doing so would erode
the party's image and affect its chances in December's legislative polls.</P>
      <P>Light was shed on the issue after Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng  issued
Saturday  a  statement  congratulating  KMT Chairman-elect Wu Poh-hsiung and
warning the KMT central about revising its "exclusion rules."</P>
      <P>The KMT central should refrain from making the revision, as the move might spark
a split within the party and push it to backtrack, Wang argued in the statement.</P>
      <P>Wang issued the call, aimed at Wu, who has long been viewed as supportive of
former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou -- the most likely KMT candidate in the March
2008 presidential election despite his embezzlement charges in mid-February,
which prompted him to resign from the party's top post.</P>
      <P>Despite corruption charges, Ma has repeatedly expressed his desire to run in the
next presidential election, and last week picked up a registration form for the
KMT's presidential primary.</P>
      <P>Wang, also a KMT heavyweight who harbors his own presidential ambitions, did not
pick up the registration form, meaning that he would not join the party's
presidential primary and will miss out on the chance to be nominated by the KMT.</P>
      <P>Taoyuan Magistrate Chu Li-lun, a member of the KMT who maintains good relations
with Ma, said the same day that it is up to the party's delegates to decide
whether or not a rule change should be implemented.</P>
      <P>"It is necessary to continue with party reform which should be dictated by the
KMT's actual needs rather than the ruling party's election strategies, " Chu
said, adding that the matter must be jointly determined by party delegates.</P>
      <P>Chu said he does not agree with Wang's viewpoint that a regulation amendment
will push the KMT to split, but added that every member in the party is free to
air his or her own opinion for discussion.</P>
      <P>Echoing Chu's comments, KMT Legislator Lai Shyh-bao, who is widely taken to be a
protege of Ma, opined that no one, neither the party central, could determine
whether or not the regulations should be modified.</P>
      <P>As a democratic political party, the issue must be decided after being fully
studied by delegates in the party's national congress slated for June, Lai said,
adding that it is still too early to discuss the matter now.</P>
      <P>In contrast, KMT Legislator Ho Tsai-feng urged Wu to carefully and wisely deal
with the proposal regarding an amendment to the party's "exclusion" regulations,
as it may hinder the party's chances in the year-end legislative election, which
also will serve as a litmus test for the March 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Yu Shyi-kun, chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) ,
commented later the same day in southern Kaohsiung City that the KMT's intention
to revise the party's regulations to firm up Ma's chances of participating in
the next presidential election clearly showed that the party does not deserve
the people's trust.</P>
      <P>Former Premier and former Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh, a DPP heavyweight  vying
for the party's nomination  for the coming presidential, said during a campaign
stop in Kaohsiung County that the KMT's rule change plan fully reflects the
party's hopelessness, and that the people of Taiwan must not allow such a
corrupt political party to regain power in 2008.</P>

      <P>People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong who flew to San Francisco after
ending up in a far behind third place in the election of Taipei mayor last
December, will return to Taipei Tuesday, PFP lawmaker Daniel Hwang said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Hwang said he and other PFP lawmakers believed Soong who declared his quit from
politics after the Dec. 7 election will pull his weight in pushing for the
cooperation of PFP and Kuomintang in the forthcoming legislative elections.
After leaving the island for four months, Hwang said he is sure that Soong has
figured out some ways to help the country and his party or he would not come
back at this time.</P>
      <P>He would not elaborate on whether Soong will help Kuomintang and PFP to enter
joint candidates with the best hope in the year end legislative election or
whether Soong will use his personal influence to push for the cooperation
between the two KMT presidential hopefuls, former KMT chief Ma Ying-jeou and
Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, in the 2008 presidential election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET SEEKS TO PRESERVE SANATORIUM BUT MAKES NO GUARANTEE</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Cabinet expressed its willingness Monday to save the 70-year-old Losheng
leprosarium from being dismantled to make way for a Taipei metro depot project,
but fell short of satisfying patients and preservationists by making mandatory
its request that the Taipei County Government suspend the demolition.</P>
      <P>As the April 16 departure deadline for patients with Hansen's disease still
living in the Losheng Sanatorium, in Hsinchuang City, Taipei County, draws near,
a group of patients and activists visited the Cabinet-level Public Construction
Commission and demanded that an alternative retaining 90 percent of the existing
4-hectare compound be adopted.</P>
      <P>Chairman of the commission Wu Tse-cheng said in a joint news conference with
petitioners that he will do his best to communicate with Taipei County
Government and Taipei City's Department of Rapid Transit Systems (DORST) so as
to provide "at least one to two more months" for a better solution to be worked
out.</P>
      <P>He said the three agencies have been meeting and seeking technically feasible
measures to meet the 90 percent preservation demand.</P>
      <P>"We will try to preserve as much as possible and will explain to the public
where preservation is for technical reasons not feasible," he said.</P>
      <P>Lee Tien-pei, president of the patients' self-help organization, said he was
disappointed with Wu's stance, saying the Executive Yuan should immediately
issue formal instructions ordering the Taipei County Government to halt
demolition.</P>
      <P>However, Wu declined the request, saying "there must be mutual respects between
agencies."</P>
      <P>Cheng Wen-lung, a lawyer from the Legal Aid Foundation, appealed to what he
called the two key persons in determining whether the sanatorium remains in
place after April 16: Premier Su Tseng-chang and Taipei County Magistrate Chou
His-wei.</P>
      <P>Cheng said Magistrate Chou must not order the demolition before a renewed
assessment over the whole project is completed, "otherwise he will be condemned
in history."</P>
      <P>He called on Su to publicly meet with the patients and listen to their wishes
and opinions, as well as to order a halt to the eviction, "so to remove
uncertainties afflicting society and the patients."</P>
      <P>The leprosarium was built in 1930 by Japanese colonizers to treat patients with
Hansen's disease in segregation, and the Kuomintang regime in its early years in
Taiwan inherited the policy. In later years, patients were later allowed to
leave the sanitarium, but many, having lived in chronic isolation and faced
discrimination had little choice but to stay, long since grew accustomed to the
settings.</P>
      <P>Several dozen elderly patients still live in the compound and are resisting the
government's plan to relocate them to a nearby high-rise hospital.</P>
      <P>Preservationists have been advocating for the patients' right to stay and say
that as the only leper colony in Taiwan, the institution provides living
testimony to past indignities endured by the patients and is thus of great
historical and cultural value.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BCC REFUSES TO GIVE BACK TWO RADIO FREQUENCIES</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Taipei-based Broadcasting Corporation of China (BCC) urged the National
Communications Commission (NCC) Monday to maintain its status as an independent
agency and ignore the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government's demand
that the NCC take back two radio frequencies being used by the BCC.</P>
      <P>The BCC said in a statement that if the government keeps pressing the NCC to
take back the two frequencies, the BCC will resort to administrative litigation
and demand state compensation.</P>
      <P>The BBC explained that in 2004, the Government Information Office had agreed to
a corrective measure proposed by the Control Yuan -- the nation's highest
watchdog body -- that the BCC give back the radio frequency being used by its
Formosa Network when the company's digital broadcasting begins commercial
operations.</P>
      <P>The statement pointed out that BCC has not yet applied for commercial digital
broadcasting, and therefore the government would be "eating its own words" if it
requires the BCC to give back the frequency.</P>
      <P>The statement further noted that the NCC has not reclaimed another radio
frequency being used by the BCC's Wave 96, a music network, mainly because an
assessment by the NCC has led to the conclusion that the BCC would have a great
chance of winning a court battle to claim state compensation if the NCC takes
back the frequency.</P>
      <P>The BCC used to be a broadcasting company owned by the Kuomintang (KMT), which
held power in Taiwan for 51 years until 2000.</P>
      <P>The company was founded as the Central Broadcasting System in Nanjing in 1928
and adopted its current name in 1947. It moved to Taiwan in 1949 when the
Kuomintang government lost a civil war against the Chinese Communists.</P>
      <P>The BCC, which has the most radio network services in Taiwan, became a privately
owned company unrelated to the KMT in 2005.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ON PAR WITH OTHER COUNTRIES IN PACE OF WARMING: CWB</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan is on par with other countries around the world in terms of warming, a
senior official of the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Wu Teh-jung, director of the CWB's Weather Forecast Center, made the remarks
while delivering a report at the Legislative Yuan's standing Committee on
Science, Technology and Information.</P>
      <P>During the session, lawmakers asked Wu's view on some media reports claiming
that Taiwan has outpaced the rest of the world with climatic change causing its
average temperature to rise at double the global average in recent years.</P>
      <P>In response, Wu said such reports are misleading. According to Wu,  the global
average temperature  incorporates  sea surface temperatures, but rises in global
surface temperatures more double the overall average. Therefore, he said, Taiwan
hasn't surpassed any other country given its pace of warming.</P>
      <P>On lawmakers' complaints that the CWB's weather forecasts were not accurate
enough, CWB Director-General Hsin Chiang-lin said it's hard to achieve a 100
percent accuracy in weather forecasting given the stochastic nature of
temperature.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, Hsin said the CWB has continue improving the quality and
accuracy of its weather forecasts in recent years. The CWB no longer lags behind
its counterparts in other countries in typhoon forecasting, particularly
regarding a typhoon's course, Hsin said proudly, adding that the results of
various public opinion surveys showed that 80 percent of local residents were
satisfied with the CWB's round-the-clock weather forecasting service.</P>
      <P>While some people blamed the CWB for failing to forecast a squall that struck
certain parts of western Taiwan April 2, Hsin said it is very difficult to
forecast a squall the day before because squalls tend to gather in just three to
four hours.</P>
      <P>A squall is a sudden, sharp increase in wind speed usually associated with
active weather, such as rain showers, thunderstorms or heavy snow.</P>

    <HEADLINE>2 NCC COMMISSIONERS SHOULD BE SUSPENDED FOR VIOLATIONS: CABINET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 10 (CNA)
04/10/07  11:30:19
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has ordered that two commissioners of the National
Communications Commission (NCC) be suspended from their jobs for violating
conflict of interest laws.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan Deputy Secretary-General Chen Mei-ling made the announcement at a
news conference Monday in which an investigation report on the body's legal
infractions and certain controversial decisions were unveiled.</P>
      <P>According to the report, NCC commissioners Wu Chung-chi and Liu Kung-chung
should be suspended for violating the law requiring that public functionaries
avoid conflicts of interest as well as the Civil Service Law and the NCC Organic
Law, both of which demand ethical integrity.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Liu had hired an in-law and that Wu had hired his son to serve
as their chauffeurs using government-provided cars, Chen said both of them
should be suspended from their jobs pending further probes by the Control Yuan
to determine how much they should be fined and whether they should be
permanently fired.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Central Personnel Administration will soon refer the conflicts of
interest cases involving the two NCC commissioners to the Control Yuan for
further investigations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said, the Executive Yuan will serve a written admonition to both
NCC Chairman Su Yeong-chin and Vice Chairman Liu Chung-teh as they had signed
the official documents endorsing the two commissioners' illegal hiring of their
relatives as chauffeurs.</P>
      <P>Chen further said that if NCC commissioners are disgruntled with the Executive
Yuan's sanctions, they can seek remedies in accordance with the law.</P>
      <P>The  report  authored  by  a  special  panel  headed  by Minister-without-
Portfolio Hsu Chih-hsiung also outlined several other major legal transgressions
the NCC needs to deal with and some loose ends it needs to tie up.</P>
      <P>First of all, the report slammed the NCC for its inaction toward the notorious
"tarred duck" incident involving a controversial cable TV station, TVBS. The
channel broadcast a story late last year claiming that some local poultry
slaughterhouses had used asphalt to remove duck feathers. The report caused a
widespread health concerns and caused severe slumps in duck sales and prices.
However, the story later turned out to be a false alarm as laboratory tests
showed no trace of the harmful substance. The NCC has so far not investigated
the case nor handed out any punishment to the TV station.</P>
      <P>Terming the NCC's inaction as dereliction of duty, the report demanded that the
NCC immediately look into the case and mete out due penalties.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the report said the NCC's recent punitive measures toward mishandling
and broadcasting of a gangster's video by TVBS and its affiliated channel TVBS-N
were not harsh enough to meet the public's expectations. It demanded that the
NCC renew probes and hand out punishments accordingly if any new evidence
surfaces about criminal activities behind this case.</P>
      <P>The report also demanded that the NCC cease operations of its petition committee
which the report termed as "overstepping the NCC's authority." Since the
Executive Yuan has not yet laid out guidelines for the administrative appeal
system involving independently run organs like the NCC, the report said, the NCC
should not have set up a petition committee to handle appeals about its
disciplinary sanctions. The report said the NCC petition committee should hand
over all relevant files to the Executive Yuan's Petition Committee within one
month.</P>
      <P>The report also demanded that the NCC get back in two months two radio
frequencies it previously gave to Broadcasting Corp. of China, which used to be
owned by the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and whose properties were partly
snatched up by improper means during the period of KMT authoritarian rule. The
retrieval is in compliance with the principle that radio frequencies are public
assets, the report added.</P>
      <P>Noting that supervision  of Web site and Web domain name registration is the
duty of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, the report said the
NCC is not eligible to formulate relevant rules and therefore should scrap its
preparatory work in this regard.</P>
      <P>As to moonlighting, the report said the NCC Organic Law has clear regulations
which require NCC commissioners to strictly abide by the principles  of
avoiding  conflicts  of  interest.  Individual commissioners should quit their
moonlighting jobs if they do not comply with relevant stipulations, it added.</P>
      <P>While the NCC is screening various license applications or disciplinary
sanctions, the report said, individual commissioners who have ties with those
cases should refrain from joining discussions or votes in line with the conflict
of interest avoidance principle. As some commissioners failed to follow this
principle previously, the report reminded all members not to repeat their
wrongdoings.</P>
      <P>In support of the government's crime-fighting campaign, the report asked the NCC
to establish a "telecommunications figurehead" data bank and pull out all the
stops to prevent phone fraud.</P>
      <P>The report also blamed the NCC for its recent letters to local elementary and
junior high schools demanding them to allow for the establishment of mobile
phone base stations on their campuses, which caused a panic among school
authorities and parents. Although the issue has been clarified, the report said,
the NCC should see to it that similar mistakes do happen again.</P>
      <P>As the Council of Grand Justices  has declared the NCC's partisan-based
formation as unconstitutional and set Dec. 31, 2008 as its  "sunset"  or
"closure"  date,  the  report  urged  the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan
to pass amendments to the NCC Organic Law during its current session to pave the
way for the birth of a new NCC that meets all legal and constitutional
requirements.</P>
      <P>The current NCC is made up of commissioners recommended by political parties in
proportion to the number of seats they hold in the legislature.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NCC MAY SEEK CONSTITUTIONALITY RULING ON SUSPENSION OF COMMISSIONERS</HEADLINE>

      <P>The National Communications Commission (NCC) said Tuesday it may seek a ruling
on the constitutionality of the Executive Yuan's demand that two of its
commissioners be suspended from their jobs for violating a conflict of interest
law.</P>
      <P>The NCC made the remarks a day after the Executive Yuan announced that NCC
commissioners Wu Chung-chi and Liu Kung-chung should be suspended for violating
the spirit of the conflict of interest law by hiring  close  relatives  to
serve  as their  chauffeurs  in government-provided cars.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan Deputy Secretary-General Chen Mei-ling said at a news conference
Monday that the Central Personnel Administration will soon refer the cases to
the Control Yuan to determine how much they should be fined and whether they
should be fired.</P>
      <P>The NCC will hold a meeting Tuesday to discuss response measures, including
whether to ask the Council of Grand Justices to rule whether the Executive
Yuan's demand to suspend its commissioners is constitutional, an NCC spokesman
said.</P>
      <P>In addition to informing the Executive Yuan of its conclusions, the spokesman
said, the NCC will also furnish the Legislative Yuan with a copy of its letter
to the executive branch since the appointment of NCC commissioners was approved
by the legislature in the first place.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the NCC is an independent body which is not under the
jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, the spokesman argued that the Executive Yuan
doesn't have the power to suspend NCC commissioners.</P>
      <P>After conducting a thorough probe into the NCC's operations, a special panel
headed by Minister-without-Portfolio Hsu Chih-hsiung also came up with a report
Monday that outlined several other major legal transgressions the NCC needs to
deal with and some loose ends it needs to tie up, including probes into the
notorious "tarred duck" false alarm, the gangster threat video incident, the
phase-out of the NCC petition committee, and retrieval of two radio frequencies
given to Taipei-based Broadcasting Corp. of China.</P>
      <P>In xxxx, the Council of Grand Justices declared the NCC's partisan-based
formation as unconstitutional and set Dec. 31, 2008 as its "sunset" or "closure"
date.</P>
      <P>The current NCC is made up of commissioners recommended by political parties in

      <P>NCC commissioners have decided to step down en masse Jan. 31, 2008 when the term

    <HEADLINE>GRASS MOUNTAIN CHATEAU TO BE FULLY RESTORED WITHIN 2 YEARS: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>

      <P>The late President Chiang Kai-shek's first official residence in Taiwan, which
was badly damaged in a fire late Friday night, will be restored to its past
glory within two years, Taipei City's culture chief said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lee Yung-ping, director of the Department of Cultural Affairs of the Taipei City
government, said an emergency response panel has been formed in line with the
cultural properties protection law and other regulations to prepare for the
restoration of the Grass Mountain Chateau on scenic Yangmingshan in suburban
Taipei.</P>
      <P>According to an initial estimate, Lee said, the restoration project will cost
between NT$30 million (US$909,090) and NT$50 million.</P>
      <P>She added that Lee Chung-yao, an authority in historical relics and heritage
site restoration, has agreed to take charge of the Grass Mountain Chateau
rehabilitation project.</P>
      <P>The 83-year-old traditional architectural restoration master also played a
leading role in the chateau's first large-scale face-lift a few years ago, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>The special panel is also composed  of legal experts and specialists familiar
with Japanese architectural styles and features, Lee said, adding that she is
confident that the rehabilitation project will proceed smoothly and be
successful in fully restoring the building's charm and glory.</P>
      <P>The style of the 660-square-meter main building, on an estate covering  about
1,815 square meters,  is typical  of Japanese architecture of the 1920s. The
wall of the entrance to the main building is made of stone, with Japanese wooden
structure inside.</P>
      <P>The fire destroyed more than half of the main building, with the wooden interior
being completely burnt. The stone wall remains intact. Total damage is estimated
at roughly NT$36 million (US$1.09 million), Lee said.</P>
      <P>The city government listed the building as a protected heritage site in 2002,
and it has since served as a cultural activity center that encompasses an
exhibition hall, a small-scale showroom, a multifunctional auditorium, a
performance area, a semi-open air coffee shop, and a management center. The mid-
night fire damaged the exhibition hall, known as Meilu Hall, and the coffee
shop, known as Yingho Hall.</P>
      <P>The city government commissioned the Buddhist Fo Kuang University to manage the
chateau in 2002, and the cooperation contract is scheduled to expire at the end
of June this year.</P>
      <P>The chateau was built in 1920 by Taiwan Sugar Corp.  in preparation for a visit
by then-Japanese Crown Prince Hirohito. Historical records show that Hirohito
stayed at the house for only one hour and 50 minutes. The chateau later served
as a spa villa for social celebrities during the period of Japanese colonial
rule.</P>
      <P>In December 1949, the Republic of China government moved its seat to Taipei, and
President Chiang Kai-shek chose to stay at the chateau,  making it Taiwan's
first presidential residence. The president and his wife lived at the house
until May 1950 when a new house was built in Taipei's Shihlin district. The
chateau later served as the first couple's summer villa.</P>

      <P>The crash of an Army UH-1H helicopter in a remote mountain region in Kaohsiung
County in southern Taiwan a week ago could primarily be attributed to human
factors, a senior military officer said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wang Kuo-chiang, commander of the Army's Airborne and Special Operations Command
(ASPC), made the remarks at a news conference held at the Ministry of National
Defense on the flight mishap in which the helicopter struck a radio tower and
crashed in mid-air, resulting in the death of all eight officers aboard.</P>
      <P>Quoting an investigation report by a special military team, Wang said the
tragedy could be attributed to a combination of factors, including the pilot's
failure to gauge the height of the tower, the crew's poor emergency response
skills, and the pilot's failure to alter course or return to base when weather
condition's suddenly turned for the worse.</P>
      <P>All the debris of the crashed UH-1H chopper were sent back to the Kueijen Army
Base in neighboring Tainan County for re-assembling to facilitate probes into
the cause of the disaster.</P>
      <P>The flight mishap claimed the lives of all the eight Army officers aboard. Five
of the bodies were recovered at the crash site Tuesday, but rescuers didn't
locate the remaining three until Wednesday noon when they were discovered lodged
in the girders of the radio tower, which the helicopter had collided with in bad
mountain weather.</P>
      <P>The crashed helicopter was manufactured in 1974.  Under a cooperation deal with
U.S.-based Bell Helicopter, the military's Aero-Industry Development Center --
the forerunner of the present-day Aerospace Industry Development Corp. -- has
built a total of 118 UH-1Hs since 1969.</P>

      <P>The government hopes Nicaraguan Minister of Foreign Affairs Samuel Santos can
visit Taiwan soon to discuss the feasibility of bilateral cooperative projects
in various fields, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Simon Ko, director-general of the MOFA's Department of Central and South
American Affairs, made the remarks after Santos postponed his visit to Taiwan
originally scheduled for late March.</P>
      <P>At a regular press conference held at the MOFA's office, Ko attributed Santo's
delaying his visit to his busy schedule, noting that he has to help the new
Nicaraguan government plan for many policies.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's government has not received any details of planned
cooperative projects from the Nicaraguan government, Ko said concrete
cooperation between the two countries will have to be discussed during Santo's
Taiwan visit.</P>
      <P>According to Ko, President Chen Shui-bian became aware of Nicaragua's urgent
medical needs during his visit to the Central American country in January to
attend Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega's inauguration and managed to send
medical groups to Nicaragua and Saint Kitts and Nevis to offer voluntary medical
care in late March through MOFA's International Cooperation and Development
Fund.</P>
      <P>The service provided by Taiwan's medical groups has received a warm response
from the Nicaraguan government and people, Ko added.</P>
      <P>During Chen's visit to Nicaragua in January, Santos and his Taiwanese
counterpart,  James Huang,  signed a memorandum  of understanding, with the two
sides promising to maintain diplomatic ties. On that occasion, Santos was
invited to visit Taiwan in March to materialize the cooperative projects between
the two countries, an invitation that Santos accepted immediately.</P>

The killing of Italian journalist Daniele Mastrogiacomo's Afghan interpreter
Adjmal Nashkabandi by the Taliban shocked Italy. The opposition urged Premier
Romano Prodi to explain his administration's efforts for rescuing Mastrogiacomo

      <P>Legislator Huang Chao-hui of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) urged
the government and Taiwanese business leaders Tuesday "not to recognize, follow
or participate in" a forming federaton of Taiwanese businessmen's associations
in China, and to boycott the organization.</P>
      <P>Huang made the call at a press conference at the Legislative Yuan while
suggesting businessmen operating in China withdraw their investments back to
Taiwan when Beijing shows reluctance to protect their rights and interests. He
denounced China's attempt to ally with Taiwanese business people against
Taiwan's government by posting ranking officials in the planned business group.</P>
      <P>A formal ceremony marking the establishment of the controversial federation is
scheduled to be held April 15 in Beijing, with Chen Yunlin, director of China's
Taiwan Affairs Office of State Council, to serve as honorary chairman of the new
organization.</P>
      <P>He Shizhong, director of the Chinese office's Economic Bureau, will be the
group's vice chairman and secretary-general, Huang said, questioning the purpose
of the two Chinese officials' presence in an organization being formed to defend
and safeguard the right and interests of Taiwanese businessmen operating in
China.</P>
      <P>Huang argued that while Taiwanese businessmen's associations around China have
been sparing no efforts to protect Taiwanese interests on the mainland, the
forming business federation is "trapped  by Beijing's  'one China' scheme
disguised  in the federation's organic constitution' which stipulates the
leadership of the federation has to respect the "one China" principle and
advocate China's idea of unification.</P>
      <P>Huang questioned how an organization founded for the purpose of "national
unification" will work to fight for Taiwanese business people's rights and

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that the government's capacity to deal
with an emergency has been upgraded through a simulated drill.</P>
      <P>The president  made the remarks  after completion  of the first-stage of the
drill sponsored by the National Security Council (NSC) at a command center in
Taipei. Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang  and related
government  officials also participated in the drill on short notice.</P>
      <P>"Only through careful planning in peacetime can we prepare ourselves well for
war," the president said.</P>
      <P>He added that repeated drills also help to discover problems and find ways to
solve them, thus avoiding unnecessary losses in times of war.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the NSC denied reports that the drill has anything to do with
political situation or the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The NSC was responding to reports by the China Times, a local newspaper, that
said the drill was designed with nearly 200 scenarios against a domestic
background in which Ma Ying-jeou, former chairman of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT), loses the 2008 presidential election and his supporters,
refusing to concede defeat, stage a massive protest. As a result Taiwan is
thrown into chaos.</P>
      <P>The NSC said that such reports  are groundless  and pure fabrication.</P>
      <P>The NSC explained that the drill envisioned a scenario in which major political
and economic changes take place in China and international clashes erupt due to
competition for valuable sources in the Asia and Pacific waters, leading in turn
to a bold move by China to launch a lightning attack on Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Tainan Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair was indicted Tuesday for awarding undue profits to a
construction company, with prosecutors asking that he be given a 12-year prison
term, according to the Tainan Prosecutors Office.</P>
      <P>The Tainan Prosecutors Office brought the indictment against Hsu after wrapping
up its lengthy probe into the case, initiated by tip offs from the municipal
public work affairs bureau and a letter signed by over 10 city councilors
accusing Hsu of unlawfully favoring the construction company which won a
contract to build the city's underground malls.</P>
      <P>Although three Tainan mayors had involved in the underground mall project, Hsu
is the only one indicted in the case for allegedly using his position to profit
NT$200 million for the company since the construction project kicked off more
than a decade ago during the tenure of former Mayor Shih Chih-ming.</P>
      <P>Nine other suspects, including three officials and ex-officials of the Tainan
city government,  and six employees  from the construction company were also
indicted on charges ranging from corruption and illicit profiteering to document
forgery, prosecutors said.</P>
      <P>According to prosecutors, the investigation showed that Hsu, who took over the
mayoral post in Dec. 2001, allegedly instructed municipal officials in charge of
the construction project to conspire with the company's manager, surnamed Kuo,
to chalk up illegal profits, although the municipal public work affairs bureau
and supervisory agents of the construction plan had discovered the plot and
tried to stop them.</P>

      <P>It is "very likely" that the historic Grass Mountain Chateau on scenic
Yangmingshan in suburban Taipei was destroyed by an arson attack, Taipei Mayor
Hau Lung-bin said Tuesday, adding that a police task force will be formed to
look into it.</P>
      <P>Hau made the announcement after the City Fire Department came out with a
preliminary conclusion from its investigation into the Friday night fire that
gutted much of the 660-square-meter main building of the chateau -- the first
official residence of the late Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hau indicated that investigators found a kind of accelerant at the fire site and
oil-stained residue outside the building. From that evidence, experts concluded
that fire was set to the house from the outdoor dining area.</P>
      <P>Fire Department officials said it is not usual to see a fire that breaks out so
quickly and violently damage more than half of the structure, leaving the wooden
interior completely consumed.</P>
      <P>Hau would not offer any conjecture over the reasons why people acted to damage
the protected heritage site before police find one. He stressed the chateau is
not only a historic building, but also a priceless cultural and tourist
attraction.</P>
      <P>A cultural spot is "innocent" in disputes over an historical figure's conduct,
the mayor said, noting the case has been listed as a major criminal offense, and
that those involved may face punishment by imprisonment of 3 to 10 years.</P>
      <P>The chateau was built in 1920 by Taiwan Sugar Corp.  in preparation for a visit
by then-Japanese Crown Prince Hirohito. Historical records show that the prince
stayed at the house for only one hour and 50 minutes. Latter, the chateau was
turned into a spa villa for social celebrities during the period of Japanese
colonial rule.</P>
      <P>In December 1949, the Republic of China seat of government moved to Taipei and
President Chiang chose to stay at the house until May 1950 when a new residence
was built in Taipei's Shihlin district. The chateau later served as a summer
villa for Chiang and his wife.</P>
      <P>The city government listed the house as a protected heritage site in 2002.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu pledged Tuesday that the southern Taiwan city will
embrace central government agencies relocated to Kaohsiung, stressing that
municipal authorities will do their utmost to find suitable spaces for them.</P>
      <P>Chen made the pledge following a municipal meeting and expressed her
appreciation for the Kaohsiung city council's decision a day earlier to create a
task force to promote relocation.</P>
      <P>Apart from the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) and the Fisheries Agency under the
Council of Agriculture (COA) , the Kaohsiung city council also added the
Cabinet-level National Council on Physical Fitness and Sports to its list of
agencies that might be relocated on the grounds that the city is to host an
international sports event in 2009, she noted.</P>
      <P>In addition, she said, the Kaohsiung city government is setting its sights on
relocating the Examination Yuan and the Control Yuan, Chinese Petroleum Corp.
and Taiwan Power Company to Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Relaying the Executive  Yuan's firm stance on achieving a "regional balance" and
of developing "twin nuclei" in northern and southern Taiwan, Chen said that the
CLA's proposed relocation to Kaohsiung is of great significance to the city's
600,000 workers as it should then be able to better address local laborers'
needs and enhance their interests and rights.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the Kaohsiung municipal authorities have identified a good
location for the CLA to construct an office building, Chen said that the CLA's
relocation is just a matter of time, adding that a local fishermen's training
center in Chienchen district has been designated to house the COA's Fisheries
Agency.</P>

after the Army released its report regarding the causes of the crash of the Army
UH-1H helicopter, which hit a transmission tower in the remote mountain region
in Kaohsiung County in southern Taiwan last week.</P>
      <P>The Minister of National Defense Lee Jye has since demanded that all aircraft of
the same type be grounded for further security checks.</P>
      <P>An Army official said the Army will also require in the future that both chiefs
and deputy chiefs of a same unit not board the same aircraft.</P>
      <P>The MND report attributed the plane's crash to a sudden change of the weather in
the region that day and an inability on the part of the pilot and crew members
to respond to the emergency.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Army officials added that they will resume as soon as possible the
operations of other UH-1H helicopters, but did not elaborate on when that might
be.</P>

      <P>Police in central Taiwan have impounded 500 pairs of name brand shoes after
searching a home in the Hsitun District of Taichung city, a spokesman for the
Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that the CIB's crime prevention center in central Taiwan had
received a tip in early April that students hired by a counterfeit ring had been
seen peddling fake Nike and Adidas sports shoes in the night market outside
Fengchia University.</P>
      <P>He said a student peddler would let would-be buyers go through a catalogue of
fake name brand shoes, and that once the customers decided on the shoes they
wanted, a runner would rush to a distribution center by motorcycle to get the
goods.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, agents with the CIB's anti-crime center in central
Taiwan obtained a search warrant and raided a distribution center quartered in a
home Monday. They seized 500 pairs of fake shoes under six name brands: Nike,
Adidas, Puma, Gucci, Royal and New Balance.</P>
      <P>The police have detained a student peddler, surnamed Lo, for questioning and are
trying to locate the leader of the counterfeit ring.</P>

      <P>The government has activated a mechanism to ensure a steady supply of sand and
gravel on the market, the Public Construction Commission of the Executive Yuan
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Commission officials said the Ministry of Justice has closely monitored price
fluctuations of gravel in the construction market and acted severely in cases of
hoarding.</P>
      <P>The government also encourages imports from the Philippines to help relieve the
shortage of gravel resulting from China's export ban of its sand and gravel,
which came into effect March 1, commission officials said.</P>
      <P>Officials noted that the government knew last December that China would soon ban
its gravel exports. The Mainland Affairs Council, the nation's top China policy
charter, has commissioned the semi-official Taiwan External Trade Development
Council to discuss the matter with China.</P>
      <P>As construction companies complained that they could only manage until the end
of this month at most, and that "one fourth of planned housing complexes cannot
begin construction because of the shortage of the main building material, " the
government has taken several measures to ensure a steady supply on a long-term
basis.</P>
      <P>Those measures include assistance to construction companies to import 3 million
cubic meters of gravel from the Philippines and coordinating with water resource
officials to urgently increase river dredging to supply an additional 4.5
million cubic meters of gravel.</P>
      <P>Taiwan began to import sand and gravel from China six years ago, and until
recently nearly one-third of its market needs were filled by imports from China.</P>
      <P>China's Ministry of Commerce and General Administration of Customs announced in
April 2006 that it would ban the export of natural sand starting May 1, 2006,
but postponed the date to March 1 this year after Chinese suppliers asked for
more time to cushion the impact on their businesses.</P>
      <P>The supply shortage has caused the prices of sand and gravel in Taiwan to rise
steadily in recent months, according to market analysts.</P>

      <P>The government supports promoting sports racing activities, such as car racing
and yachting, in Taiwan, but the proposal has yet to be fully assessed, Premier
Su Tseng-chang said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks during a question-and-answer session at the Legislative Yuan
while fielding questions from main Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Liao Wan-ju,
after a government planned opening of car racing and horse racing in central or
southern Taiwan, unveiled last weekend, stirred up heated debate.</P>
      <P>According to Su, the government backs a well-planned opening of car racing or
yachting with an aim of bolstering tourism-related businesses, while the horse-
racing proposal is out of the question due to animal protection concerns.</P>
      <P>"For the time being, the entire project is still on the drawing board," he made
clear.</P>
      <P>Chang Ching-sen, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic

car racing and horse racing in central or southern regions, beginning in June,
in an effort to revive local economies and strike a balance in regional
development.</P>
      <P>But the idea drew flak from KMT lawmakers, who criticized the ruling  Democratic
Progressive  Party administration  for rash policy-making and called it a tactic
to win voter support in the run up to the legislative and presidential

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Hsieh Kuo-liang said Tuesday that he will
propose a revision to the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall
Law, requiring that future presidential  candidates  pass the general English
proficiency test at the intermediate level.</P>
      <P>Hsieh stressed that since the president has to represent the country's interests
at many international occasions, a certain level of English speaking capability
is a must.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the country's general English proficiency test (GEPT) has been
divided into five categories: elementary, intermediate, high-intermediate,
advanced and superior, and he will propose that future presidential candidates
only pass the intermediate level of English proficiency, which is roughly
equivalent to the English ability of a junior high school graduate.</P>
      <P>Noting that currently Taiwan's public servants have to pass the GEPT test when
seeking a promotion, and even taxi drivers are strengthening  their English
proficiency,  Hsieh said requiring presidential candidates to understand and be
able to participating in simple English conversations with foreigners at
international events is quite reasonable.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he will also conduct public hearings  to seek the opinions of the
experts and the general public in this regard and will ask for the Grand
Justice's explanation on whether the proposal would violate the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the ruling Democratic  Progressive  Party (DPP) Legislator Hsiao Bi-
kim blasted Hsieh's proposal, describing it as an international joke, which she
said does not conform to international practice and would violate the
Constitution.</P>
      <P>Hsiao noted that voters will have their own way to gauge a presidential
candidate's global vision, and it should not be proven by tests.</P>
      <P>In addition, she added, one's global vision is not well reflected in language
ability.</P>
      <P>Hsiao went on that she has never heard of another country requiring their
presidential candidates to have certain degree of proficiency in a foreign
language.</P>
      <P>Even if some foreign leaders are proficient in English, they will certainly
speak in their own languages  at such occasions to underscore their own
country's national identity, Hsiao said, adding that Hsieh's proposal both
violates the Constitution and constitutes a discrimination against the country's
national language.</P>

to the 23rd Han Kaung drill slated for April and May this year.</P>
      <P>The scenario assumes that Taiwan will have to defend itself from a Chinese
invasion launched in 2012 due to Taiwan's refusal to participate in unification
talks, and that there will have been no progress in arm procurements by that
time, Chiu said, adding that this year's Han Kuang drill has two phases: full-
scale maneuvers and computer war game simulations.</P>
      <P>According to Chiu, the full-scale maneuvers will be carried out in Penghu,
Hualien, Yilan, Hsinchu, Taichung, Changhua and Pingtung areas as scheduled by
MND, some of which will be open at certain times to the public. The computer war
game simulations will proceed for five consecutive days at all command centers,
Chiu added.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Huge Protest in Iraq Demands U.S. Withdraw

Tens of thousands of protesters loyal to Moktada al-Sadr, the Shiite cleric,
took to the streets of the holy city of Najaf on Monday in an extraordinarily
disciplined rally to demand an end to the American military presence in Iraq,
burning American flags and chanting Death to America!

Residents said that the angry, boisterous demonstration was the largest in
Najaf, the heart of Shiite religious power, since the American-led invasion in
2003. It took place on the fourth anniversary of the fall of Baghdad, and it was
an obvious effort by Mr. Sadr to show the extent of his influence here in Iraq,
even though he did not appear at the rally. Mr. Sadr went underground after the
American military began a new security push in Baghdad on Feb. 14, and his
whereabouts are unknown.

Wall Street Journal:Bring Stag Revelry To Eastern Europe

When they joined the European Union in 2004, countries such as Estonia, Slovakia
and Lithuania dreamed of an influx of wealthy Western tourists eager to explore
their historic cities. What they got were gangs of British cutting loose with
soon- to-be bridegrooms and brides.

Adam Burrows and 21 of his friends traveled to this former Soviet republic on
the Baltic Sea two weekends ago to celebrate his coming wedding.

British bachelor and bachelorette parties are moving farther afield. With low-
cost airlines offering cheap fares to Eastern Europe, some of the EU's newest
members are discovering the drunken underbelly of British tourism. enditem</TEXT>

      <P>The outcomes of the U.S. and Taiwan presidential elections in 2008 will not
change the United States' longstanding "one China" policy, U.S. Secretary of
State Condoleezza Rice said Tuesday</P>
      <P>Responding to reporters' questions at the State Department, Rice said the United
States expects that neither China nor Taiwan will take any steps to unilaterally
change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The news conference was held for journalists from around the world taking part
in the Edward R. Murrow Program for Journalists sponsored by the International
Visitor Leadership Program.</P>
      <P>Asked if the U.S. policy of providing Taiwan with weapons for its self-defense
needs would change if cross-strait tensions were triggered by moves by Taiwan
toward de jure independence, Rice said that Washington expects both sides of the
Taiwan Strait to respect the "one China" policy, adding that "we have
obligations under the Taiwan Relations Act to help Taiwan defend itself, and we
will carry out those obligations through the military cooperation that we have
with Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Rice said she does not believe that anyone would benefit from the outbreak of
conflict in the Taiwan Strait, adding that Washington has repeatedly stated its
polices regarding the Taiwan Strait and has made clear that it supports cross-
strait dialogue and cross-strait interactions.</P>
      <P>"There actually is a lot of trade and economic development across the straits,
and I think that is also a buffer against conflict," she continued.</P>
      <P>"It's my very strong view that this should not and will not change as a result
of '08 because it's been a standing policy of the United States for many, many

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several executive members of the state-run Chunghwa Telecom Co. Workers' Union
petitioned Wednesday against the management's ongoing "inhumane" movement to lay
off workers in a drive to streamline the company.</P>
      <P>In front of the Legislative Yuan, the protesters chanted slogans, such as
"foreign investors profiteering, workers wailing, " while calling for the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC), which holds a 36-percent
stake in the company, to replace its designated chairman, Ho Chen-tan, who they
claimed has been using "inhumane" means of all kinds since 2006 to lay off
workers in order to "please" foreign investors.</P>
      <P>In the streamlining movement, Ho ordered that 1,600 workers be laid off in a
two-week period at the start of this month, Chunghwa Telecom Workers' Union
Secretary-General Chuang Ping-tang said.</P>
      <P>Under the directive, Chuang noted, executives of various Chunghwa Telecom units
were assigned "a layoff quota" which forced them to press "targeted" workers to
leave by all possible means, including changing workers' positions at will and
forcing public service personnel into marketing the company's products.</P>
      <P>Chuang said a 48-year-old technician at Chunghwa Telecom's generator room in
Fengshan, Kaohsiung County committed suicide by hanging last September because
of the workplace pressures. Tan left behind a wife, young daughters and elderly
parents.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lai Shin-yuan of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union received the
petition on behalf of her party and criticized the company which generates
annual profits of around NT$40 billion (US$1.2 billion) for its violation of an
agreement that it signed with the workers' union in 2005 when it began the
process of privatization. The agreement stipulates that no workers are to be
laid off within five years of its signing.</P>
      <P>The Chunghwa Telecom Workers' Union demanded that the MOTC replace Ho at once,
otherwise it will mobilize 5,000 members to stage a protest at the ministry
headquarters May 1.</P>

      <P>Veteran Taiwan female athlete Chi Cheng launched a new "walk to stay healthy"
campaign Wednesday, calling for all residents in Taiwan to walk 10,000 steps
each day to stay fit and healthy.</P>
      <P>Chi, who earned the nickname "the flying antelope" for breaking records at world
track and field events several decades ago, said at a news conference that she
now walks to stay fit and that rapid walking even helped cure her urinary tract
infection.</P>
      <P>Chi broke the 100-meter and 200-meter sprint world records in the 1970s.</P>
      <P>In her first "walk to live longer" campaign launched five years ago, Chi urged
people to walk 5,000 steps a day to stay fit and healthy. Chi also suggested
that interested people buy pedometers to keep track of the number of steps they
take each day.</P>
      <P>According to Lien Chin-chien, executive director of the Hope Foundation
established by Chi five years ago, more than 20,000 pedometers were sold around
Taiwan last year, indicating that an increasing number of people have grown fond
of walking and keeping track of how many steps they take.</P>
      <P>Lien quoted  a Hope Foundation  member  who is a medical professional as saying
that walking 10,000 steps a day can surely help prevent many chronic diseases.</P>
      <P>Chi, who launched the Taiwan Walk Day on Nov. 11, 2006, said she will again lead
people from 25 cities and counties around the country to "walk to stay healthy"

      <P>Legislators of the ruling and opposition parties reached a consensus Wednesday
regarding the upgrading of the Republic of China passport to a "chip passport"
in the near future.</P>
      <P>The legislators reached the consensus while screening the clauses of proposed
revisions to the passport statute at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hsu Kuo-yung of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , who
is also chairman of the Legislative Yuan's Foreign and Overseas Compatriot
Affairs Committee, noted that the "chip passport"  will not contain the
fingerprint  and iris pattern information of the passport holders as "biometric
passports" do, adding that there is no need for the public to worry about
leakage of their biometric information.</P>
      <P>Hsu further said that the information included in the "chip passports" will be
the same as that already included in current passports and that the new
passports will better protect the holders' personal information.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that more than 30 countries have issued "chip passports" and that if
Taiwan nationals have such passports, it will facilitate their entry into these
countries.</P>
      <P>As to whether the "chip passports" will be more expensive than the ones
currently issued, Hsu said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has allocated
funds to cover the increased cost of producing the "chip passports" and that
there will not be a price hike in applying for the new passports.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, the MOFA has earmarked NT$146 million (US$4.42 million) for
producing chip passports and another NT$52 million for apparatus to read such
passports.</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Wednesday that she delivers on her promises with
action and that she is certain that some 100,000 "good housekeepers" will be
produced before the end of her term to help boost the women's labor force
participation rate and to help share household chores as well.</P>
      <P>Lu said that so far, some 70,000 housekeepers -- including workers specializing
in senior care and care for the physically or mentally challenged, child care
workers, and workers specializing in home management -- have been trained under
a three-pronged project that she has seen to be carried out since April 2006.</P>
      <P>She said she is confident that the goal of having 100,000 "good housekeepers"
trained will be achieved before her term expires in May 2008.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks while addressing a ceremony marking the commencement of a
home manager training workshop in a junior high school in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>She said that of Taiwan's female population of 11.28 million, about 4.3 million
are working women. Of the 4.3 million working women, some 70 percent have been
working in the service sector.</P>
      <P>There are about 400,000 double-income households islandwide, which will need the
help of housekeepers, she added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, she said, there are some 400,000 women who no longer work because
they got married or had children, and there are some 560,000 single-parent
families, most of which consist of a mother and child.</P>
      <P>Members  of these groups may need to seek employment  as housekeepers, she
speculated.</P>
      <P>The "Good Housekeeping Project" -- put forward by Lu in 2005 and introduced by
the Council for Economic Planning and Developent in April 2006 -- is aimed at
providing women with training in senior care, child care and home management to
enhance their employment opportunities,  with the goal of training 100,000
professional housekeepers over a two-year period.</P>
      <P>So far, under the "Good Housekeeping Project, " more than 18,000 people have
completed training as care givers for seniors or physically or mentally-
challenged people, while some 42,000 child care workers and 8,000 workers
specializing in home management have completed training, Lu said.</P>

      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) agreed Wednesday to Mandarin
Airlines' request to end its flight services on the Taipei-Taichung route from
May 1 and said that those who have already booked flights on the route can have
their money refunded in full.</P>
      <P>CAA officials said the decision was made after the administration came to the
conclusion that offering flight services on the route was no longer profitable
given the alternative transportation choices available.</P>
      <P>Mandarin Airlines is currently the only air carrier operating flight services on
the Taipei-Taichung route. UNI Airways Corp. ended its flight services on the
route in July 2004 due to decreasing passenger numbers.</P>
      <P>According to CAA statistics, Mandarin Airlines suffered losses amounting to
NT$45 million (US$1.36 million)  in 2006 on the Taipei-Taichung route. The
airline said that after high-speed rail transportation services began Jan. 5,
the passenger occupancy percentage of each flight on the route dropped to 16
percent between January and March and slid to 4.3 percent in April.</P>
      <P>It costs NT$700 for a single high-speed rail trip between Taipei and Taichung,
which takes around one hour. In comparison, a one-way air ticket on the route
costs NT$1,342, with passengers spending about 50 minutes on the plane.</P>
      <P>Mandarin Airlines officials said that the company has decided to focus more on
boosting its international flight services based at the Taichung Airport after
quitting the Taipei-Taichung route.</P>
      <P>At present,  the airline operates regular passenger flight services between the
central Taiwan city and Hong Kong, as well as to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam,

04/11/07  17:38:50
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators from across the political spectrum had mixed opinions Wednesday
about whether the government should open Chinese yuan exchange services on
Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>In light of the fact that Taiwan may soon fully open its doors to Chinese
tourists, the legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) proposed that before a cross-strait cash settlement agreement is signed,
certain selected Taiwan banking institutions be authorized by the Taipei-based
Central Bank of China and the Financial Supervisory Commission to offer Chinese
yuan exchange services on a trial basis.</P>
      <P>Disagreeing with the proposal, opposition People First Party Legislator Liu Yi-
ju said it would be prohibitively inconvenient for Chinese tourists visiting
Taiwan to exchange Chinese currency at "selected" banks in appointed places,
adding that the restrictive measure would only contribute to increasing the
amount of counterfeit Chinese currency in circulation in Taiwan, which would in
turn jeopardize Taiwan's financial order.</P>
      <P>Liu suggested that Taiwan seek to build a cross-strait cash settlement mechanism
by cooperating with the Bank of China (Hong Kong) Co., which was authorized by
Beijing three-and-a-half years ago to conduct free conversions between the
Chinese yuan and foreign currencies.</P>
      <P>After the ruling and opposition lawmakers failed to reach any consensus on the
issue, DPP Legislator Chang Ching-hui, who presided over Wednesday's session,
ruled that the issue should be debated again after negotiations between the
ruling and opposition camps are completed.</P>
      <P>Unconfirmed reports have said that Taiwan residents may have amassed a total of
more than 100 billion Chinese yuan (US$3.03 billion) over the past several
years.</P>
      <P>The accumulation of Chinese currency in Taiwan can be attributed to a
combination of factors, including China's chronic trade deficit with Taiwan and
the inclination of Taiwan businesspeople operating in China to bring home
Chinese yuan, the sources said.</P>
      <P>In March 2004, the central bank began to allow each local citizen to bring in up
to 6,000 yuan per homecoming visit, and the amount was raised to 20,000 yuan in
October 2005. According to an estimate by the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council, local people have made a total of more than 12 million visits to China
over the past three years.</P>

      <P>The Legislative Yuan's Sanitation, Environment  and Social Welfare Committee
passed Wednesday  an amendment to the Mental Health Law of 1990, seeking to
provide better protection of the rights of mental patients.</P>
      <P>The amendment would add new clauses to penalize those who abandon family members
with mental illnesses, mistreat them physically or spiritually, keep them in an
environment where they could easily be harmed, or force them to marry.</P>
      <P>Violators of the proposed new clauses would be subject to a fine of between
NT$30,000 and NT$150,000. In addition, authorities may publicize the names of
the offenders and require that they receive eight to 50 hours of counseling on
family education at a fee.</P>
      <P>The amendment would also abolish a provision in Clause 30 that allows teaching
hospitals to perform chemical castrations on mental patients through a long-
acting implant of hormonal drugs.</P>
      <P>The proposed change is based on arguments that forced chemical castration
violates the rights of mental patients, and new drugs are available to provide
more effective treatment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT HEAVYWEIGHTS CALL FOR UNITY</HEADLINE>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Honorary Chairman Lien Chan called Wednesday
for "unity and cooperation" among party members to embrace victory in future
elections.</P>
      <P>Lien issued the call during a ceremony at the KMT headquarters in which Wu Poh-
hsiung took over the helm of the party after winning a landslide in a
chairmanship by-election last week. Former Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and KMT-
affiliated Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng were also present.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the 2008 presidential election, Lien stressed the need for unity
if the KMT hopes to take back power. Taiwan has markedly moved backwards over
the past seven years, he said.</P>
      <P>"As long as every party member is able to speak out frankly and sincerely for
the sake of Taiwan's interests, democracy and future, there is nothing which
cannot be achieved, " Lien said, expressing his hope that all party members will
fully support the yet to be formed KMT presidential ticket.</P>
      <P>Lien hailed Wu as a "wise,  broad-minded,  courageous and enthusiastic" man
capable of leading the KMT forward.</P>
      <P>Ma praised the recent KMT chairman by-election as a "gentleman's race," and
called Wu's election a deep reflection of the party's wide ethnic diversity. Wu
is a Hakka Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>Ma, who enjoys widespread public support and is the most likely KMT candidate to
run in the next presidential contest, reiterated that he will invite Wang to
serve as his running mate -- in keeping with an agreement forged between Ma and
Wang in prior negotiations mediated by Lien and Wu -- if he wins the party's
nomination.</P>
      <P>"The KMT cannot afford another split in the 2008 presidential election," Ma
insisted.</P>
      <P>For his part, Wu promised to make an all-out effort to serve the KMT and the
country and called for all comrades' backing and cooperation as fierce
challenges are ahead of the party.</P>
      <P>"The KMT should apologize to the Taiwan people who have suffered setbacks in
many fields due to its defeat to the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the
2000 presidential election due to a split, " Wu said, adding that he is prepared
"to help pair up a most qualified KMT ticket in the coming presidential race."</P>
      <P>"Both Ma and Wang are fair-minded and the KMT's great assets," Wu said.</P>
      <P>"From now on, let's forget all the unpleasant in the past and embark on a new
beginning," he added.</P>
      <P>Wang, who said a day earlier that he would issue a statement clamoring for
continuous and visionary KMT reform Wednesday at Wu's inauguration ceremony,
fell short of doing so, and only congratulated Wu on his election and voiced
hope that the KMT could secure a victory in December's legislative election and
the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The legislative speaker said Tuesday that he would spell out to the KMT, for its
own good, something from the depths of his heart because the party cannot apply
one set of rules to others but a different set for itself.</P>
      <P>Ma and Wang were strong  opponents  vying  for the KMT's presidential
nomination, but Wang failed to pick up a registration form to take part in the
party's presidential primary while Ma did -- a development which means that Wang
is out of the primary. But it remains unclear whether Wang would form with Ma a
KMT presidential ticket.</P>
      <P>Speculation has arisen that Wang might choose to run as an independent in the
2008 presidential election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>UNIQUE INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY BECOMES TTV'S BIGGEST SHAREHOLDER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  11 (CNA)
04/11/07  19:56:55
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Unique International Technology Inc. became the largest shareholder of the
Taiwan Television Enterprise Ltd. (TTV), one of the four terrestrial networks on
the island, after it bought 25.77 percent of the government's stakes in the TTV
in an open bidding Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Unique International Technology offered NT$1.74 billion (US$53.73 million), or
NT$24.1 per share, beating three possible rivals in bidding held at the
headquarters of the Taiwan Cooperative Bank. The three other aspirants were ERA
Communications, Hungpan Construction and snack giant Want Want, which offered
NT$23.02, NT$22.68 and NT$22.31 per share respectively.</P>
      <P>Another potential buyer, Dafeng TV Ltd., withdrew from the bidding at the last
minute Tuesday because it is partially owned by foreigners who are not allowed
to operate a terrestrial television station like TTV.</P>
      <P>During a report to a government qualification screening panel recently, Unique
said that it already possesses 14.4 percent of the TTV shares. In addition, it
shares the same ideals as Lai Kuo-chou, former TTV chairman and son-in-law of
former President Lee Teng-hui, who has obtained 4.84 percent of TTV shares from
TTV's former Japanese shareholder.</P>
      <P>At the time, Unique officials said that if it wins the open bidding, it would
become TTV's dominating shareholder, avoiding a possible ownership battle that
would risk undermining the company's competitive edge.</P>
      <P>Teng Mei-hua, vice president of Unique International Technology, said Wednesday
that the company will make the best of TTV's brand name and resources.</P>
      <P>She noted that Unique TV started with capitalization of only NT$300,000, but the
company made it big by targeting specific viewing groups, and that it will
continue applying this approach after it becomes the biggest shareholder in the
45-year old terrestrial network.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Cabinet spokeswoman Chen Mei-lin said that the bidding was held in a
"transparent and smooth" manner. The media kept abreast of the bidding process
through a video hookup to the conference room where the bidding took place.</P>
      <P>On whether the Executive Yuan was satisfied with the Unique's offer, Chen said
that it is not appropriate for her to comment on whether the offer is up to
market value.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that it will take about one month for the Unique International
Technology to obtain the shares, saying that it will sign an agreement with
Taiwan Cooperative Bank Friday and post a deposit of NT$70 million to
demonstrate that it will not renege on the deal after winning the bid. The
company will then have to file a request with the National Communications
Commission before it can obtain the TTV shares.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the second-stage share release of TTV targeting the public and
staff of TTV is expected to be completed this November.</P>
      <P>A number of state-controlled banks own around 47 percent of the TTV shares. They
have recently begun selling the shares under a government privatization plan.</P>
      <P>The government's plan to sell off the TTV shares drew public attention after the
Ministry of Finance, which manages the government's stocks in the company,
decided on March 21 to replace Lai Kuo-chou, who was appointed by the ministry
to act as the government's representative at the TTV, on the grounds that he was
purchasing TTV stocks from several private investors in an attempt to take over
the company.</P>
      <P>However, Lai accused the Executive Yuan of pulling strings in an attempt to help
the private Liberty Times group win control of the TTV because of the close
association between Liberty Times' founder and Democratic Progressive Party
government leaders.</P>
      <P>His accusation was backed up by TTV's former Japanese stock investor Fuji
Television Network, whose representative in Taiwan claimed at a March 25 news
conference that Cheng Wen-tsang, then-minister of the Government Information
Office, tried to persuade him to sell Fuji's stocks to Liberty Times at a dinner
party in January when a new policy forbidding foreign ownership in terrestrial
television entered into force.</P>
      <P>Cheng, who was also a member of the government panel in charge of examining  the
potential  bidders'  qualifications,  denied the accusation but nonetheless
withdrew from the panel and resigned from his GIO post on April 3.</P>

      <P>The National Health Research Institute (NHRI) forged cooperative ties with
Tainan City-based National Cheng Kung University Hospital (NCKUH) Wednesday in a
drive to seek a better balance in medical resources distribution across the
northern and southern parts of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>NHRI President Kenneth K. Wu and National Cheng Kung University President Lai
Ming-chao signed the cooperation agreement in a ceremony also attended by
Legislator Lai Ching-teh, who has spared no efforts promoting draft legislation
for the cancer prevention and control act and establishment of a cancer research
institute in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Cooperation between the institutions will focus on clinical cancer research  and
the southern  Taiwan research  facility's formation, which it is believed will
help enhance cancer prevention and control efforts.</P>
      <P>NCKUH President Chen Chih-hung indicated that cancer has been the leading cause
of death in Taiwan. Moreover, the researchers have found that people in
different regions on island are affected with different kinds of cancer.</P>
      <P>For example, he said people living in the southern area are prone to cancer
affecting liver, lung, skin and bladder, and cancer patients in the south are
likely to be affected by the disease in different ways from those in the north.</P>
      <P>NCKUH Cancer Center Director Chou Chen-yang explained that in the north, the
hepatitis B virus is often found to be the culprit in causing liver cancer,
while liver cancer patients in the south were mostly found to affected by the
disease because of hepatitis C virus infection.</P>
      <P>Chou further said the number of oral cancer patients in southern Taiwan is much
larger than that in the north.</P>
      <P>Under the cooperation agreement, the NHRI will open a clinical research
cooperative ward at NCKUH in the second half of this year and dispatch eight of
its cancer experts to the hospital for cancer research programs, according to
the institute which has already similar research-oriented wards at three major
hospitals in Taipei -- Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Tri-Service General
Hospital, and National Taiwan University Hospital.</P>

NT$1.74 billion (US$53.73 million), or NT$24.1 per share, beating three rivals.</P>

      <P>An alliance of civic groups in Taipei dedicated to the protection of forests
said Wednesday that it is suing officials of the Taipei City Government for not
protecting decades-old trees at the Songshan Tobacco Factory, where the city
government will build a large sports stadium.</P>
      <P>Members of the Taipei Tobacco Factory Public Park Promotion Alliance staged a
skit in front of the Taipei District Prosecutors' Office, hinting that Taipei
Mayor Hau Lung-bin is planting young trees with left hand while cutting older
trees with his right.</P>
      <P>Pan Han-shen, secretary-general of the Green Party Taiwan, which joined with
other like-minded groups to form the alliance, noted that the Taipei City
Government failed to protect the 353 trees around the factory, which were
planted during the period of Japanese colonial rule in Taiwan and are supposed
to be protected by the government.</P>
      <P>With the city government failing to list the 353 trees as protected, and instead
listing only 136, Pan said the alliance had grounds to sue officials for forgery
and dereliction of duty, and asked that all of the transplanting task be
stopped.</P>
      <P>As the site for the "big Dome" sports stadium is one of the few forested areas
left in Taipei and has long been considered the "lungs of the city, " the
alliance has staged many protests against the city government in order to
protect the few oasis in this metropolitan city.</P>
      <P>Pan said they are not opposed to a sports stadium, however, a survey conducted
by the city government in 2002 did not mention that the development project
would include department stores, shopping malls, office buildings and several
five-star hotels outside the stadium.</P>
      <P>Noting that this project is now far from public expectations of a sports
stadium, Pan said the alliance has won the endorsement of many villagers near
the Sungshan Tobacco Factory for their campaign dubbed: "We want forests, and
not commercial complexes, " and the campaign is still underway.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) warned Wednesday it is illegal for
plastic surgeons in Taiwan to use Restylane Sub Q -- a non-animal hyaluronic
acid gel -- for breast enlargement operations.</P>
      <P>Liao Chi-jou Liao, director-general of the DOH's Bureau of Pharmaceutical
Affairs,  said that doctors  who perform  such non-surgical  treatment will be
referred to the Committee for Disciplinary Sanctions of Physicians in accordance
with Article 25 of the Physicians Law.</P>
      <P>Liao explained that the DOH has only allowed plastic surgery clinics to inject
small amounts of Restylane Sub Q to remove wrinkles or enhance facial contours.</P>
      <P>The health official stressed that the DOH has not given doctors permission to
inject Sub Q gel into the breast tissue because a breast enlargement operation
usually requires more than 100 cc of the gel, which may not always stay where it
should.</P>
      <P>"Unless a doctor who has performed such an operation can present convincing
documents to prove that Sub Q gel is harmless when used for breast enlargement,
he or she will face disciplinary measures according to law," Liao said.</P>
      <P>He urged women contemplating breast augmentation to consider carefully the risk
of Sub Q injection.</P>
      <P>Liao gave the warning after a plastic surgery clinic touted the advantage of Sub
Q for breast enlargement by asking a porno movie actress who underwent such an
operation to present herself as an example.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ASTRONOMERS OBSERVE STAR FORMATION TRIGGERED BY MASSIVE STARS</HEADLINE>

04/11/07  21:34:24
(By Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two local astronomers have observed and proved for the first time that existing
massive stars can trigger the formation of a series of new stars, verifying a
longstanding hypothesis of such a possibility, sources at National Central
University (NCU) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The findings have been published by the U.S.-based monthly "The Astrophysical
Journal" in its March issue.</P>
      <P>Lee Hsu-tai and Chen Wen-ping, both from NCU's Institute of Astronomy, had
searched the skies for evidence supporting the hypothesis for several years
before discovering in early 2006 that two separate stars, in the constellations
Orion and Lacerta, had "helped" the formation of young stars within a radius of
several hundred light-years.</P>
      <P>During an interview with members of the local press earlier this week, Lee
explained that the astronomers have long proposed the possibility that the
radiation emitted by a massive star -- which by definition means one with a mass
of at least ten times that of the sun -- could compress the molecular clouds
around it and prompt the formation of low- and intermediate-mass stars inside
the condensed clouds.</P>
      <P>In independent observations of the two massive stars, the astronomers found that
the massive stars had each "pushed" back a vast patch of cloud -- leaving traces
of either bright-rimmed clouds or comet-shaped ones, and that some stars already
existed in between the massive stars and the vast clouds, with other stars
forming inside the bright-rimmed and comet-shaped clouds.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that the age of the new stars are in inverse proportion to their
distance from the massive star, which means those nearer to the massive star
have existed for a longer period of time.</P>
      <P>"Such a distribution of age-distance demonstrates that these smaller stars are
gradually brought into existence by the massive one, " Lee added.</P>

      <P>Lawmakers called for the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) to step up
monitoring of several state-owned enterprises to improve their lackluster
performance.</P>
      <P>The legislators made the appeal at a legislative committee while listening to
the MOEA and its affiliated agencies report on the execution of its budgets in
2006 and the first three months in 2007.</P>
      <P>The legislators were concerned that six state-owned enterprises under the MOEA
-- CPC Corp., Taiwan, Taiwan Power Co., Taiwan Sugar Co., Taiwan Water Corp.,
CSBC, Taiwan, and Aerospace Industrial Development Corp. (AIDC) -- reported
revenues of NT$1.29 trillion and expenditures of NT$1.3 trillion with pre-tax
losses of NT$12.55 billion, which was a far cry from its original estimate of
NT$8 billion surplus, mainly because of the surging cost of purchasing crude oil
by the CPC.</P>
      <P>The six state-owned enterprises recorded revenues of NT$291.04 billion and
expenditures of NT$289.13 billion with a pre-tax surplus of NT$1.91 billion in
the first three months this year, mainly because of the implementation of a
floating oil price mechanism which was put into practice early this year.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Cheng-feng of the opposition Kuomintang said that although
Taisugar, the largest land owner in Taiwan, showed a surplus, it was due mainly
to land sales as its businesses have continued to lose money.</P>
      <P>Since the sugar industry is no longer a government monopoly enterprise, he
suggested that it close doors and turn over its land to the National Property
Administration under the Ministry of Finance.</P>
      <P>Taisugar President Lin Chung-hung said that the company has been losing money
because its operations are constrained by government policy, although it has

      <P>Legislator Chang Hwa-kuan of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party said that
the AIDC has lost NT$5.2 billion, or more than half of its capitalization, since
1995.</P>
      <P>Except for products sold to the Ministry of National Defense, Chang said, the
AIDC has lost money on all other product lines, and therefore the MOEA should
replace the company's chairman Feng Shih-kuan, or she will push to have the
AIDC's budget cut.</P>

      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang confirmed Wednesday that the Fisheries Administration
under the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) will soon be relocated to
Kaohsiung City in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Su confirmed the move during a question-and-answer session at the Legislative

      <P>According to COA Deputy Minister Lee Jen-chyuan, personnel at the COA's
Fisheries Administration will begin relocating to Kaohsiung in October this year
at the earliest.</P>
      <P>In the near future, the COA will have different units scattered across Taiwan in
line with the Executive Yuan's efforts to strike a balance in development in
northern, central and southern regions.</P>
      <P>A group of about 60 administration officials will be the first to move to
Kaohsiung, with the rest of the staff following in several phases, said
Fisheries Administration Deputy Director-General Sha Chih-i.</P>
      <P>According to Sha, the administration presently has more than 200 officials
stationed in northern Taiwan, with 99 percent of them residing in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The administration will eventually station some 70 workers in Taipei for regular

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite an ongoing controversy surrounding the late President Chiang Kai-shek, a
ruling party lawmaker Wednesday asked government authorities to draw up tour
packages featuring Chiang in an effort to lure more tourists from home and
abroad.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yi-jin of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), made the proposal
during a question-and-answer session of the Legislative Yuan, with Janice Seh-
jen Lai, director-general of the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications, promising to come up with a package within a
week.</P>
      <P>Yeh suggested the Tourism Bureau work on such a package in response to an
anticipated opening of Taiwan to Chinese tourists, as everything related to
Chiang is of great interest to them.</P>
      <P>Although Chiang's first official residence Grass Mountain Chateau -- later
transformed into a public leisure space with a restaurant and an exhibition room
displaying favorite dishes and items of the Chiang family -- was badly damaged
in a suspicious fire late last Friday, Yeh said that many resort villas of
Chiang still can be found scattered in the rest of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The Tourism Bureau should focus its efforts on developing packages featuring
Chiang to better attract Chinese tourists in anticipation of that opening," Yeh
said.</P>
      <P>Echoing Yeh's idea, main opposition Kuomintang lawmaker Wang Yu-ting expressed
her support for the proposal.</P>
      <P>Wang also criticized tourism authorities for lacking a vision to explore
Taiwan's resources and potential in this field. There are 13 national scenic
areas across the country, but they need to be better programmed and promoted to
court more tourists, she pointed out.</P>

      <P>A Kaohsiung municipal zoo veterinarian had his left forearm bitten off by a
crocodile Wednesday, but surgeons are operating to reattach the limb, retrieved
after a policeman shot dead the crocodile, according to various sources.</P>
      <P>A Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital surgeon said the medical team is
optimistic about the operation to reattach the limb.</P>
      <P>He said that while thegolden timefor such surgeries falls within six hours of
injury, the operation on Chang began slightly more than an hour after the
incident. However, he said, the extent to which the reattached arm will be
functional is uncertain.</P>
      <P>The attack occurred in the afternoon at Shou Shan Zoo when senior official and
veterinarian Chang Po-yu was treating a sick crocodile and removing an
anesthetic needle, zoo nurse Huang Shu-chen said.</P>
      <P>The surgeon said that the 38-year-old Chang was conscious and that the arm was
severed about 5 cm below the elbow.</P>
      <P>Emergency Service officers said a police officer had to shoot dead the crocodile
using a pistol from several meters away in order to retrieve Chang's severed
forearm, which was still held in its mouth, so that the forearm could be put on
ice and rushed to the hospital.</P>
      <P>Zoo officials said that Chang is an experienced and caring vet who had
previously risked his life entering the cages of lions and tigers in order to
save them from a flood.</P>

public support. There surely are a number of things in need of improvement and
reflection, but he is more than satisfied with three important accomplishments
realized during his term.</P>
      <P>The first, Chen said, is the peaceful transfer of power, making Taiwan  a
genuinely  democratic  country;  the second  is the nationalization of armed
forces to prevent national defense from being used by a certain political party

      <P>Chunghwa Telecom Co. strongly denied an accusation that management has been
"inhumanely" laying off its workers to downsize the company, according to a
statement issued by the company Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The statement came after the company's labor union staged a demonstration
against the layoffs earlier that day in front of the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The workers also called for the replacement of the chairman, Ho Chen-tan, who
was designated by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC).</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Telecom stated that it did not refuse to negotiate with the union as

      <P>The actions the company has taken to adjust its organizational structure are
aimed at improving service quality, the statement said, adding that they have

      <P>The Losheng Sanatorium will not be immediately demolished after the previously
set April 16 deadline, Taipei County Magistrate Chou His-wei said Wednesday
after Premier Su Tseng-chang promised in a meeting with patients and
preservationists to find solutions.</P>
      <P>However, Chou claimed that the Executive Yuan should take full responsibility
for any delay in the opening of Hsinchuang Line of the Taipei metro system
caused by its policy change.</P>
      <P>The Hsinchuang leprosarium, which still houses several dozen patients, was
completed in 1930 by Japanese colonizers; it is now in the way of a Taipei metro
depot construction project.</P>
      <P>The campaign to preserve the leprosarium for the sake of the patients' human
rights and its own historical and cultural value has increasingly gathered
momentum over the past few weeks, as April 16 was set as the date after which
the Taipei County Government could, at any time, conduct a forceful demolition
of most of the buildings and relocate those patients who refuse to move.</P>
      <P>Patients and preservationist were able Wednesday to speak face to face with Su
after holding three protests outside of the premier's residence since early
March.</P>
      <P>During the meeting Su promised that the government would do its utmost to
promote the adoption of a project option that would retain 90 percent of the
existing compound while still avoiding a delay to the opening of the metro line,
Cabinet spokeswoman Chen Mei-ling said.</P>
      <P>Chen said it will take one or two months for the Cabinet-level Public
Construction Commission to communicate with Taipei County Government and Taipei
City's Department of Rapid Transit Systems (DORST) to work out a solution
acceptable to all parties concerned.</P>
      <P>The current plan would retain 41.6 percent of the existing 4-hectare compound,
but preservationists argued that it would destroy the oldest and most valuable
parts of the sanatorium.</P>
      <P>Preservationists welcomed Su's response, but said the plan to hold a parade this
coming Sunday afternoon, starting at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, to voice
support for the preservation of Losheng will not be changed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SURGERY ON CROCODILE-BITTEN VET SUCCESSFUL: HOSPITAL</HEADLINE>

      <P>A zoo veterinarian whose left forearm was bitten off by a crocodile Wednesday
has undergone a successful limb reattachment operation, Kaohsiung Medical
University Hospital said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, officials of the Kaohsiung municipal Shou Shan Zoo said the male Nile
crocodile, which had to be shot twice with a police officer's pistol before it
would let go of the severed arm, appeared to be intact thanks to its thick
armor, though a more thorough check will need to be conducted later. It was
previously assumed to have been shot dead.</P>
      <P>The incident  took place Wednesday  afternoon  when senior veterinarian Chang
Po-yu was trying to remove anesthetic needles from the crocodile, which seemed
inactive and anorectic for about a week, prompting Chang to check its health,
according to zoo officials.</P>
      <P>While Chang was rushed to the hospital, a police officer was called to shoot the
crocodile in order to retrieve the severed arm still held in its mouth. Upon
being shot the second time, the crocodile violently swung its head and flung the
limb over the railing and out of the compound.</P>
      <P>The medical team said it was fortunate that the forearm was retrieved quickly
enough to attempt a reattachment operation.</P>
      <P>An overnight operation successfully reconnected most of the blood vessels,
nerves and muscles, a hospital spokesman said, adding that infection is the
primary risk facing the patient, who will remain in the Intensive Care Unit for
at least the next week or two.</P>
      <P>The spokesman also said that it would take several years of rehabilitation to
bring the injured arm back to even 80 percent of functionality, which is the
best that can hoped for.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu Thursday morning visited Chang, who was able to
wave with his healthy right hand to cameras from his sickbed after the
operation.</P>
      <P>The city's Labor Standards Inspection Office has ordered the zoo not to allow
its staff to enter the crocodile compound before it produces a report on
improving its working practices.</P>
      <P>The incident made the crocodile a popular attraction, drawing more-then-usual
visitors to the scene, many of whom crossed the security cordon around the
compound to get a better view.</P>
      <P>In related events, several newspapers published graphic images featuring the
crocodile holding a severed arm in its mouth, sparking outcry by lawmakers,
scholars and the Government Information Office (GIO).</P>
      <P>Wang Hsing-nan, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) legislature
whip, said the press has shown no self-constraint at all and the DPP caucus will
not rule out drafting a new law to regulate the print press.</P>
      <P>An act governing publishing, seen as a relic of the authoritarian era, was
abolished in 1999.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang lawmaker Hsu Shao-ping said three out of the four national major
daily newspapers, the China Times, the United Daily News and the Apple Daily,
should apologize to the public for running the bloody pictures. Only the Liberty
Times blurred the broken arm in its publication.</P>
      <P>Kuan Chung-hsiang, a communications scholar and Chairman of the Media Watch
Foundation, said such a "disgusting" lack of discretion will only cause public
resentment of the newspapers.</P>
      <P>Lo Shih-hung, associate professor at the Graduate Institute of
Telecommunications of the National Chung Cheng University, encouraged readers to
call newspapers to voice protest.</P>
      <P>The GIO, in a news release, called on the media to exercise self-restraint, and
for civil society groups to help monitor media practices.</P>
      <P>The release said the GIO had previously suggested that the Ministry of the
Interior draft an amendment to the Child and Juvenile Welfare Law to ban media
practices of this sort, which may harm the nation's youth.</P>

      <P>The government is glad to see Japan stick to its guns while engaging with China
on issues concerning Taiwan, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Chien-
yeh said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wang was referring to a Tokyo-Beijing joint communique issued after a high-level
meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Shintaro Abe and his Chinese counterpart
Wen Jiabao in Tokyo the day before, in which Japan reaffirmed its commitment to
the two countries' 1972 joint communique in dealing with relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang said the government is relieved that Japan has neither retreated from its
original stance nor made any fundamental changes in its policy regarding Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the 1972 Sino-Japanese joint communique, Japan said it will abide by the "One
China" policy in dealing with Taiwan. Before Wen headed for Japan Wednesday on a
three-day visit to help thaw relations as the two countries work to reverse a
deterioration in ties caused in part by disagreements over history, speculation
had it that China might force Japan to make a new commitment, limiting its
substantive ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has advocated  parallel development  of Taipei-Tokyo and
Tokyo-Beijing relations, Wang said Japan should never seek to further ties with
Beijing at the expense of engagement with Taiwan, a long-time trading partner of
Japan.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that a cordial Taiwan-Japanese relationship holds the key to Asia-
Pacific stability and prosperity, Wang said he is convinced that substantive
relations between the two countries will continue to progress in the future.</P>
      <P>In a speech delivered at the Japanese Diet Thursday, the Chinese premier urged
Japan's parliament not to forget Tokyo's wartime aggression even as the two
Asian powers mend their strained ties and bolster thriving business relations.
Wen also warned the Japanese not to meddle in Beijing's relations with Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. State Department officials said Thursday that it would be more appropriate
for Taiwan to seek accession to the World Health Assembly (WHA) , the decision-
making body of the World Health Organization (WHO), as an observer, rather than
seeking to join the WHO as a full member under the name "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The State Department officials in charge of East Asian affairs said that the
United States has always encouraged Taiwan to seek "meaningful participation" in
international organizations and has believed  that the people  of Taiwan  are
capable  of making extraordinary contributions to the world health arena and
that they should enjoy the same relevant rights as other citizens in the global
community.</P>
      <P>They said the 23 million Taiwan people's opportunities to make contributions to
world health affairs will be impeded if Taiwan is barred from "meaningful
participation" in WHO activities, adding that Taiwan is entitled to that right
and privilege.</P>
      <P>However, the officials also said that it is the United States' set policy not to
support Taiwan's pursuit of joining international organizations where statehood
is required for membership, adding that the United States supports Taiwan's
seeking to join the WHA as an observer.</P>
      <P>The State Department officials made the remarks after Taiwan's foreign minister,
James Huang, confirmed in Taipei Thursday that President Chen Shui-bian had
written a letter to WHO Director-General Margaret Chan the day before in which
the president stressed that based on the WHO's spirit of protecting the health
of all peoples around the world and the notion that medical care knows no
borders, Taiwan has every right to apply to join the WHO as a full member.</P>
      <P>As a matter of strategy, Huang said, Taiwan will adopt a three-pronged approach
this year to facilitate its bid to join the world health regulatory body,
specifically continuing to seek observer  status in the WHA;  continuing  to
seek "meaningful participation" in WHO technical conferences; and applying for
full membership in the WHO under the name "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the State Department officials reiterated the U.S. stance on cross-
strait relations, saying that the United States does not support Taiwan
independence and opposes any unilateral changes to the status quo across the
Taiwan Strait by either Taiwan or China.</P>
      <P>President Chen's "five noes" pledge announced in his inaugural speech in 2000
has been the bedrock of regional peace and stability in East Asia, they said,
adding that whether Chen will deliver on his promise of not seeking independence
will be a good test of his leadership, reliability, and his ability to handle
foreign relations, protect Taiwan's interests and secure cross-strait stability.</P>
      <P>They stressed that seeking to join the WHO as a full member under the name
"Taiwan" does not comply with President Chen's pledge.</P>

      <P>Joseph Wu, who just stepped down as Mainland Affairs Council chairman, was sworn
in Thursday as Taiwan's new representative to the United States, and promised to
strengthen Taiwan's relations with the U.S.</P>
      <P>The swearing-in ceremony was held at the office of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA), with Foreign Minister James Huang standing as witness.</P>
      <P>Huang expressed hope that Wu would strengthen communications with both the U.S.
government and the American private sector to reduce misunderstandings between
the two countries and build mutual trust for bilateral benefit.</P>
      <P>Hailing Wu as an experienced and well educated public servant, Huang said Wu was
responsible for foreign affairs when he served as Presidential Office deputy
secretary-general.</P>
      <P>During his tenure as chairman of Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), Wu was in
charge of explaining Taiwan's policies toward China to the United States, Japan
and European countries, Huang added, expressing optimism that U.S.-Taiwan ties
will be further boosted after Wu takes over his job.</P>

      <P>A Japanese citizen has received a suspended sentence of 30 days in detention for
cursing at officials during immigration inspection at Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport more than a year ago, aviation police sources said Friday.</P>
      <P>The man, who is married to a Taiwanese woman and often travels back and forth
between Taiwan and Japan, is also barred from visiting Taiwan for five years,
according to the court ruling.</P>
      <P>On a trip to Taiwan in September 2005, the man became so enraged by what he
called the snail-paced immigration inspection at the Taoyuan airport that he
burst into a volley of curses when an immigration officer began checking his
travel documents.</P>
      <P>Immigration authorities later filed a lawsuit against him. After more than a
year of judicial proceedings, the Taoyuan District Court handed down its ruling
earlier this week.</P>
      <P>According to the ruling, the man had violated Article 140 of Taiwan's Criminal
Code which bans anyone from insulting a public official during the legal
discharge of his or her official duties.</P>
      <P>Immigration officials said they felt compelled to file the lawsuit to defend the
government's prestige and public authority. They expressed regret that the
Japanese man has never shown any signs of remorse for his actions and has fought
the charges by filing petitions with many local government agencies, including
the Tourism Bureau, over the past year.</P>

      <P>Prosecutors said Friday they will step up the search for the chairman of
Inventec Appliances Corp., a local handset maker that also produces iPod music
players for Apple Inc., as part of their probes into the company's suspected
involvement in insider trading.</P>
      <P>After checking with immigration, law enforcement officers from the Panchiao
Prosecutor's Office said they believe that Inventec Appliances Chairman Chang
Ching-sung is still in Taiwan, while the company's president Lee Chia-en is in
China.</P>
      <P>More than 200 prosecutors and investigators raided Inventec Appliances Thursday
afternoon to search for evidence to support charges of alleged insider trading.</P>
      <P>A total of 17 members of the company's management staff, including its vice
president and spokesman, Chen Hung-lieh, and the heads of the company's Shanghai
and Nanjing factories, Ho Tai-shui and Lai Chen-hsing, were brought back to the
Panchiao District Prosecutors Office for questioning. The interrogations
continued to midnight.</P>
      <P>In the raid at the company's headquarters in Wugu, Taipei County and at the
homes of Inventec senior executives, a massive collection of corporate documents
and accounting books were also seized.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Panchiao District Prosecutors Office said law enforcement
authorities launched the raid after receiving reliable information that pointed
to high-ranking Inventec managers manipulating the company's stock prices.</P>
      <P>A large portion of Inventec Appliances turnover for last year was derived from
the popular iPod digital music player for Apple Inc., while its handset business
accounted for only about 10 percent of the company's 2006 revenues, according to
corporate accounting records.</P>
      <P>The company's business turnover for the first quarter plunged substantially,
while its work force had also been cut by more than 10 percent to about 13,817
as of the end of March.</P>
      <P>Inventec Appliances is the latest in a spate of listed technology companies
under investigation  for suspected  insider trading, following Veutron Corp., a
memory module and scanner maker in Powerchip Group, and BenQ Corp. Inventec
Appliances is 45 percent owned by computer maker Inventec Corp.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Justice (MOJ)  officials said streamlining the financial market and
cracking down on major economic crimes have been the major targets of
prosecutorial investigations over the past half year.</P>
      <P>In the future, the officials said, prosecution authorities will continue giving
priority to dealing with five types of crime, with an aim to realizing the MOJ-
set target of pursuing 40 suspected economic and financial irregularities by the
end of this year, including at least 10 definitive cases.</P>
      <P>That means that prosecutors will tackle at least four major corporate scandals
in the coming months since they have already been in an intensive quest for
alleged legal transgressions by six listed corporations in the past six months,
including Veutron, BenQ, Inventec Appliances, Rebar Group, Chinatrust Financial
Group and China Development Financial Holding Co.</P>
      <P>According to MOJ officials, the financial crimes to be cracked down will include
insider trading and stock price manipulation, embezzlement of corporate funds,
accounting fraud and illegal lending, illegal corporate mergers and takeovers,
as well as illegal private equity transactions and capital solicitation.</P>

      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) called
Friday for solidarity among the party's four presidential aspirants and urged
their close aides to show restraint by not attacking other hopefuls.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming, caucus whip of the DPP in the legislature, said that with the
party's upcoming presidential primary, attacks among the hopefuls -- Vice
President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun, and
former Premier Frank Hsieh -- have become more fierce.</P>
      <P>Ker noted that the party's presidential primary is set to kick off in May, with
a party member vote and a series of public opinion polls to be held before the
party's presidential candidate is announced May 30.</P>
      <P>He urged the presidential hopefuls to stop their close aides from attacking
other hopefuls, adding that rifts caused now by such attacks may prove too large
to heal later.</P>
      <P>He said that the DPP will only survive with solidarity, noting that the
Kuomintang is "waiting in the wings" to take advantage of any errors the DPP may
make.</P>
      <P>He also expressed the hope that President Chen Shui-bian will continue to
coordinate among the four DPP heavyweights after they take part Saturday  in the
first  of two scheduled  platform presentations.</P>
      <P>Legislator Wang Sing-nan, another DPP caucus whip, said that continued  fighting
among the four aspirants  will disappoint supporters and have disastrous
consequences.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Yeh Yi-jin said that the four hopefuls should not forget that the
primary will produce only one candidate to represent the party in the 2008
presidential election.</P>
      <P>A prospective national leader should display a graceful manner, she said,
expressing regret that the four aspirants have resorted to attacking one
another. She added that such attacks will make it difficult to convince voters
that they can trust the DPP candidate in the presidential election, regardless
of who that candidate may be.</P>

      <P>Officials from the National Police Administration (NPA) and the Department of
Health (DOH) reached a consensus Friday on the establishment of "health police"
to help stem the rampant flow of illicit, counterfeit and bogus medications in
the country.</P>
      <P>The officials reached the consensus after engaging in a debate at a news
conference at the Legislative Yuan sponsored by opposition Kuomintang Legislator
Lai Shyh-bao on which governmental agency should be responsible for cracking
down on the flow and production of illicit drugs as well as counterfeit and
bogus medications.</P>
      <P>At the news conference, Lai said that there is only an average of one
investigator for every 40,000 people in Taiwan in terms of finding and cracking
down on illicit drugs and counterfeit or bogus medications, while penalties for
violations are too light and cases of prosecution of such crimes too few.</P>
      <P>Lai said the number of cases involving counterfeit or bogus medications in
Taiwan has increased about 50 percent over the past three years, with the number
of uncovered cases probably being much higher.</P>
      <P>He lamented  that although  it is stipulated  in the DOH organizational law that
a health police force should be established, such a force has never been set up.</P>
      <P>Lai said he will propose that the legislature request a health police force be
established within a specific period of time, that a counterfeit medication task
force be set up, and that police forces' performance in cracking down on
counterfeit medications be included in their annual performance reports.</P>
      <P>Liao Chi-chou, director of the DOH Bureau of Pharmaceutical Affairs, said that
transactions in Taiwan's pharmaceutical market total about NT$80 billion
(US$2.42 billion) annually and that the DOH has had a hard time stamping out the
trade in counterfeit or bogus medications because the profits to be made are
even higher than in illicit drug trafficking and because the punishments under
the law are too light.</P>
      <P>Liao said the DOH would be pleased to cooperate with the NPA to jointly
establish a health police force as long as there is a sufficient budget.</P>
      <P>Chen Po-hsun, a section chief of the NPA Department of Economic Affairs,  said
the NPA has agreed to have "liaison  windows" established to help crack down on
the flow and production of illicit drugs as well as counterfeit and bogus
medications.</P>
      <P>Despite their differences on the issue, the NPA and DOH officials came to a
consensus that it is imperative that a health police force be established  in
the near future to tackle the problem of counterfeit and bogus medications.</P>
      <P>The two sides, however, remained divided on how the health police force should
be set up and under which governmental agency.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER SU TO STEP ASIDE IF LIN YI-HSIUNG BIDS FOR PRESIDENCY</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday that he will step aside to let Lin Yi-hsiung
-- one of the pioneers of the democratic movement in Taiwan who is widely
respected within the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) -- run for the
presidency of the country if Lin decides to do so.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks in a question-and-answer session at the Legislative Yuan
when asked by Legislator Lee Chia-chin of the opposition Kuomintang whether or
not he would support a presidential bid by Lin by withdrawing from the DPP
primary for the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Su said Lin is the politician he respects the most and that Lin has made a great
contribution to the development of Taiwan's democratic politics while
sacrificing a great deal for the democratic movement. He said he admires Lin's
great tolerance and his charitable manner toward those who harmed him and his
family, noting that if Lin decides to run for president, he will step aside and
give Lin his full support.</P>
      <P>Lin served as DPP chairman from 1998-2000, during which time he helped Chen
Shui-bian win the 2000 presidential election, ending the Kuomintang's five-
decade hold on power. However, since that election, Lin has gradually pulled
himself out of the political scene.</P>
      <P>Lin renounced his DPP membership Jan. 24, 2006 in a statement, in which he said
constant inter-party conflict and hostility over the past several years has led
to ethnic divisions and social unrest. Expressing his disappointment with the
DPP and other domestic political parties, Lin declared that he has no intention
of serving in the DPP's administration or running for public office for the
party.</P>
      <P>Earlier on Friday, a "Lin's Friends" association was founded in a bid to gather
support around Taiwan for a planned move to persuade Lin to participate in the
presidential election next year.</P>
      <P>Asked about the new campaign, Vice President Annette Lu, one of the four DPP
aspirants for the presidency, declined to make a comment, only saying that if
Lin decides to run for president in 2008, he won't represent the DPP because he
has already quit the party.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CAUCUS CALLS FOR OPPOSITION'S SUPPORT FOR TAIWAN'S WHO BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  13 (CNA)
04/13/07  17:03:43

    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) called
Friday for the opposition parties to support Taiwan's seeking to join the World
Health Organization (WHO) as a full member under the name "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The DPP lawmakers made the call after President Chen Shui-bian's chief of staff,
Chiou I-jen, confirmed Thursday that the president had written a letter to WHO
Director-General Margaret Chan the day before in which he stressed that based on
the WHO's spirit of protecting the health of all peoples around the world and
the notion that medical care knows no borders, Taiwan has every right to apply
to join the WHO as a full member.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, Ker Chien-ming, a whip of the DPP legislative
caucus, said it has been a longstanding goal of the DPP administration to seek
Taiwan's accession to the WHO and the United Nations under the name "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, Ker added, there has been very little progress made in this
regard over the past years due to China's obstruction.</P>
      <P>Ker expressed the hope that the opposition parties will join hands with the
ruling DPP to jointly safeguard the health of all the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen Chung-hsin, director of the DPP Department of International Affairs, said
that more than 100 legislators from across the political spectrum signed
proposal last year to support Taiwan's bid to join the WHO as a full member
under the name "Taiwan, " while 95 percent of the Taiwan people agreed that
Taiwan should be admitted into the WHO -- facts indicating that protecting the
health of all of the residents of Taiwan equates to protecting an important
human right.</P>
      <P>Wang Hsin-nan, another whip of the DPP legislative caucus, said that Taiwan's
attempts to join the World Health Assembly (WHA) , the WHO's decision-making
body, as an observer, have all failed over the past 10 years, even during the
height of the scourge of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), because of
Beijing's obstruction.</P>
      <P>Wang said Taiwan, as a dynamic economic powerhouse and a sovereign state with a
population of 23 million, should be admitted into the WHO as a full member. He
called for the opposition parties not to "cooperate" with China to jointly
suppress Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan had managed to secure only "second-hand" medical and
quarantine information during the SARS and bird flu outbreaks due to China's
interference, DPP Legislator Huang Wei-che said that Taiwan should be allowed to
have dialogue with the WHO and have access to WHO meetings on the grounds that
health issues are life-and-death human rights issues.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Chang Jung-kung, deputy director-general of the opposition
Kuomintang's Policy Committee, criticized President Chen for writing to the WHO
chief about Taiwan applying to join the WHO as full member under the name
"Taiwan, " saying that the move is unrealistic and nothing but a scheme designed
to invite even greater obstruction from China on the diplomatic front so as to
help the DPP win "sympathy votes" in the upcoming major elections in the
country.</P>
      <P>In a written message issued in response to Chen's letter to the WHO chief, Chang
said it is explicitly clear in the current international situation,  including
the United States' adhering strongly to its "one China" policy, that Taiwan has
no chance of joining the WHO as a full member under the name "Taiwan" since
statehood is required for membership in the world health regulatory body.</P>
      <P>Chang said he sees the Chen administration's WHO bid not as a sincere bid to
join the organization but as "a one side, one country plot."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT URGES DPP HOPEFULS TO ENGAGE IN 'GENTLEMAN'S BATTLE'</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged the four presidential aspirants of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Friday to avoid attacking one another and to
engage in a "gentleman's battle."</P>
      <P>President Chen issued the appeal in a press release as the four hopefuls -- Vice
President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and
former Premier Frank Hsieh -- have begun to attack one another more fiercely
ahead of the party's upcoming presidential primary.</P>
      <P>The latest incident revolved around Hsieh and former Vice Premier Yeh Chu-lan,
who criticized Su Thursday for "flip-flopping" in his stances on the planned
construction of the Suhua Freeway and the planned demolition of the Losheng
Sanatorium.</P>
      <P>Su retorted by saying such attacks are mean-spirited, adding that Yu,  during
his premiership,  proposed  a budget and started construction of the freeway,
and Hsieh, his predecessor, allocated funds for construction of the freeway. He
further said that he wondered whether he would have to face the problem today if
his two predecessors had handled the issue well, according to news reports.</P>
      <P>Faced with a mounting war of words among the four aspirants, the president said
that he issued the four-point statement "in a somber mood" on the eve of the
first of two platform presentations for the four presidential hopefuls.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office sources said that the president will only watch the platform
presentation Saturday and will not speak during it.</P>
      <P>The president expressed the hope that all the DPP's presidential aspirants will
realize that the voters and the party's supporters have "high expectations" of
them and that they themselves or their close aides should "show restraint in
their actions and their words."</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that there are no differences in basic policy line among the
aspirants and that all within the party have followed the ideal of "Taiwan-
centric consciousness."</P>
      <P>The stances of the hopefuls on public issues may be different, but they can
engage in serious examination and discussion of them, the president said, adding
that he hopes to see more discussion on public issues in Saturday's
presentation.</P>
      <P>Noting that the DPP has ruled the nation for nearly seven years, Chen said that
all four aspirants have led in the administrative team before and that they
should shoulder part of the responsibility for its performance.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the performance of the administration is the concerted efforts
of all and that all should share the responsibility if there are things that
need improvement, instead of passing the buck to others.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's ultra-endurance marathoner Kevin Lin called for the public Friday to
adopt an environmental protection mindset while engaging in sports.</P>
      <P>At a colloquium sponsored by the Government Information Office (GIO), Lin, 30,
who has been running over the past 20 years and set many world records by
crossing the Sahara Desert's grueling 7,300 kilometers by foot with two other
marathoners early this year, called for professional and amateur athletes alike
to help protect natural resources around the globe.</P>
      <P>Noting that some 10,080 liters of air will be compromised by the combustion of
each liter of gasoline, Lin said it is everybody's responsibility to protect the
environment and cherish global natural resources, especially now when the
environment is increasingly being compromised.</P>
      <P>Lin, along with an American and a Canadian, ran 111 consecutive days to cross
the Sahara, enduring strong winds, which can abruptly raise sandstorms, making
it difficult to see and breathe, and extreme temperatures, which might peak as
high as 38 degrees Celsius during the day but dip below freezing at night, on
the trek, which was originally scheduled to finish in 80 days.</P>
      <P>At several points in their trek, Lin said, the trekkers stopped near sparsely
populated wells to talk with villagers and nomads about the difficulties they
face finding water -- prompting them to plan a fund-raiser for the non-profit
group H2O Africa, which was established to raise awareness about the need for
clean water throughout the African continent.</P>
      <P>Lin said peoples around the world should love and help each other and in
particular, help African peoples to secure access to clean water.</P>
      <P>He said that running in "extreme" places around the world, including the North
Pole, has helped him realize that one does not know how big the world is without
going out to experience it, and that one does not realize how valuable life is
without risking it.</P>
      <P>Lin said he will see to it that a life foundation for athletes is established
within 10 years as a means to thank his mentor, Pan Jui-keng, to give back to
Taiwanese society, and to financially help top-level athletes so that they can
devote themselves to competitions abroad without worry.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>If political power changes hands in Taiwan following the 2008 presidential
election, the country could expect an annual economic growth rates of 6 percent
from the following year on, and the national per capita income will increase to
US$20,000 by the year 2011, said Ma Ying-jeou, a former opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) chairman, Friday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economic growth has slowed significantly since the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) took the power in 2000, Ma claimed, attributing the
economic slowdown to "political unrest" caused by an "unstable government"
implementing "uncertain policies."</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during his address at a ceremony marking the establishment
of a non-profit association for Chinese regional economic and strategic
development, composed of members from the industrial, political and academic
sectors of the island, including KMT Legislators Lee Chi-chu and Chu Feng-chi,
and scholars from National Taiwan University and National Chengchi University.</P>
      <P>According  to Wang Tiao-chun,  director of the preparatory committee of the
association, the new organization is based on the idea of pushing for economic
exchanges in the "greater Chinese economic zone" comprised of China, Hong Kong,
Macau, and Taiwan, as well as promoting global cooperation and development.</P>
      <P>With that goal in mind, Wang said they hope key industrial and commercial groups
from the four main parties, and Singapore and the United States as well, will
all cross political barriers to join the organization in an effort to boost
regional development.</P>
      <P>Addressing Taiwan's economic development, Ma said that there were too many
Cabinet shuffles over the past seven years to allow most of the government's
policies to be carried out, pointing out that in the seven-year period, five
different persons have held the premier's post, there have been six ministers of
finance, six ministers of economic affairs, and seven chiefs of the government
information office.</P>
      <P>The frequent personnel shuffles have resulted in uncertainty in the
implementation of key governmental policies,  such as the on-again-off-again
construction of the fourth nuclear-power plant, the former Taipei mayor said.</P>

      <P>Water supplies in central Taiwan will be sufficient in the first part of this
year, the Water Resources Agency of the Ministry of Economic Affairs said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Agency officials noted that central Taiwan will need around 2.6 million tons of
water per day, but this amount will be available thanks to plentiful rainfall
during the first quarter.</P>
      <P>Officials said that Taichung can supply 1.3 million tons of water daily, which
is enough to meet demands, but noted that the Tachia River, the main source of
water, often becomes turbid after downpours since the devastating Sept. 21, 1999
earthquake, and that turbidity could affect water quality, and thus supply.</P>
      <P>In addition, the launch of the Central Taiwan Science Park has made demands for
water soar and heightened the risk of water shortages.</P>
      <P>The Central Taiwan Science Park needs 282,000 tons of water daily, but when the
first-stage work of the Holi water purification plant is completed at the end of
2009, water supply should no longer pose a problem.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the development of the Changpin Industrial Zone has not been as rapid
as expected, with only one third of the estimated manufacturers entering the
zone, resulting in a lesser amount of daily water use at around 8,000 tons.</P>
      <P>To effectively use water sources in the region, officials have reviewed and
adjusted the water supply. But overall, the household and industrial use of
water in Changhua are gradually exceeding available supplies.</P>
      <P>In the Yunlin Technology Industrial park, the daily water needs is around
300,000 tons, which is supplied by Chichi River, but as there is no reservoir
the industrial park has to rely on water from irrigation systems during the dry
season.</P>
      <P>To deal with the future need for massive water inputs at the industrial  park,
the agency is actively tapping other water resources.</P>

      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) reported Friday that they have for the first
time detected colding moth in a batch of imported apples from New Zealand.</P>
      <P>Officials from the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and
Quarantine said that they detected a live colding moth larvae when inspecting a
batch of New Zealand apples at Taichung Harbor, central Taiwan Thursday.</P>
      <P>The larvae was sent to the Department of Entomology of National Chung Hsing
University for examination and confirmed as colding moth.</P>
      <P>The 1,029 cartons of Fuji apples from New Zealand were determined to have failed
the quarantine inspection.</P>
      <P>According to regulations concerning the handling of apples imported from
countries and regions with colding moths, this batch of apples will be either
returned or destroyed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will also temporarily suspend imports of New Zealand apples until
Wellington looks into reasons for the pest's presence, adopts measures to
improve inspections, and notifies Taiwan that it is now free of colding moth.
Until such steps are taken, its apples will not be allowed to enter Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Officials said Taiwan has notified New Zealand to suspend its apple export
operations and that the bureau will step up inspection and quarantine measures
of imported apples.</P>
      <P>Statistics show that in 2006 apples from New Zealand accounted for 12.3 percent
of all apples imported into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has imported New Zealand apples for more than a decade, and this is the
first time that colding moth was found, officials said. Taiwan has not found

    <TEXT>New York Times: 8 Iraqis Killed in Bomb Attack at Legislature

A suicide bomber struck deep inside the heavily fortified International Zone on
Thursday, killing eight people when he detonated his explosives inside the
Parliament building, just a few feet from the main chamber.

In a separate and in some ways equally traumatic attack early in the day, a
truck bomb destroyed the beloved 60-year-old Sarafiya bridge across the Tigris
and killed six people. The heavily traveled bridge has long been a symbol of
Baghdad, illustrated on old postcards and drawings from a more peaceful time.

Wall Street Journal:Behind the Fall of Imus, A Digital Brush Fire

At 6:14 a.m. on Wednesday, April 4, relatively few people were tuned into the
"Imus in the Morning Show" when Don Imus referred to the Rutgers women's
basketball team as "nappy-headed ho's."

Ryan Chiachiere was. A 26-year-old researcher in Washington, D.C., for liberal
watchdog organization Media Matters for America, he was assigned to monitor Mr.
Imus's program. Mr. Chiachiere clipped the video, alerted his bosses and started
working on a blog post for the organization's Web site.

Yesterday, after eight days of dizzying activity, CBS pulled the plug on Mr.
Imus's hugely successful radio show. One day earlier, MSNBC had canceled its
broadcast of the show on cable TV. CBS had originally suspended Mr. Imus for two
weeks, but succumbed amid an escalating national outcry and an exodus of big
advertisers.</TEXT>

      <P>An audit showing that total revenues of state-run Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor
Corp. (TTL) in 2005 decreased by NT$4.9 billion (US$148 million) over the
previous year, with revenues in tobacco and liquor both falling, Auditor-General
Su Chen-ping said Friday.</P>
      <P>The decline in TTL's 2005 business turnover was caused by the implementation of
the Tobacco and Liquor Tax Act in 2002 that allowed for private breweries and
distilleries, and the market was flooded by counterfeit and smuggled products,
Su said, adding that TTL's failure to expand into global markets is also a
reason for its decline.</P>
      <P>The report shows the TTL's total revenues from tobacco sales declined by more
than NT$2.1 billion, falling 7.5 percent, while revenues from best-selling
tobacco products dropped by 20 percent, and sales of new products fell by 50-80
percent year-on-year. While total revenues from liquor decreased NT$2.4 billion,
or 19.35 percent, mostly in sales of Kaoliang liquor.</P>
      <P>The report shows that rice wine breweries owned by TTL are operating at less
than 20 percent of capacity, a decline apparently greater than that in 2004.</P>
      <P>Su said the Ministry of Audit has urged the TTL to come up with solutions for
better operations, and marketing strategies to improve its revenues.</P>

      <P>Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-chih said Friday that the county should merge
with Tainan City to form a single municipality and be placed under the direct
authority of the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Su told a press conference that Tainan County and City should follow the example
of Taichung City and County in central Taiwan by reqquesting that Tainan City
and County become a special municipality under the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Taichung County and City councils formally requested in 2002 that the two
administrative areas be allowed to merge into a single municipality under the
direct jurisdiction of the Cabinet, but the central government has not yet
reached a final decision.</P>
      <P>Su said it is important that Tainan City and County be merged and upgraded to
the same status as Taipei and Kaohsiung, otherwise the area will eventually
become a satellite of the southern Taiwan port city, Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Tainan Mayor Hsu Tien-tsai echoed Su's call, saying that he too has long called
for a merger between Tainan City and County.</P>
      <P>Hsu pointed out that as a city rich in history and culture, Tainan deserves to
be a municipality under the direct control of the Cabinet, just as Kyoto, Japan,
enjoys a higher status than other cities due to its cultural heritage.</P>

      <P>Police seized 34 kg of amphetamine, 130 kg of ketamine, and some 280,000 MDMA
pills, and arrested six drug smuggling suspects during a Thursday night raid on
a warehouse in the northern port city of Keelung, said police officers of the

      <P>Police said that they were surprised by sheer volume of the various  drugs
smuggled  from China,  which were seized in a record-breaking raid. Such a
quantity of drugs could supply the needs of approximately 1 million addicts,
they added.</P>
      <P>According to the CIB, a drug smuggling ring involved in the case had
successfully shipped drugs from China to the island three times. The

      <P>The inauguration of Taiwan's first high-speed rail system has resulted in a
lower number of passengers using the other means of transportation to travel the
western part of Taiwan, according to officials from the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>The airliners have been the hardest hit, the officials said, adding that the
Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) has announced that all domestic flight
services will soon cease operations at Taichung Airport in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The announcement came after the CAA approved Wednesday a Mandarin Airlines plan
to cease servicing the Taipei-Taichung route May 1.</P>
      <P>The airline company reported losses totaling NT$45 million (US$1.36 million) in
2006 on the route.</P>
      <P>Mandarin Airlines, the only aviation company currently operating the Taipei-
Taichung route, follows in the footstep of UNI Airways Corp., which ceased
servicing the route in July 2004 due to falling passenger numbers.</P>
      <P>The average passenger occupancy rate for all flight services on the Taipei-
Taichung route slid to 24.8 percent in February from last December's 37.4
percent, while that on the Taipei-Chiayi route dropped from 63.4 percent to 46
percent during the same period, officials said.</P>
      <P>These two routes have suffered most following the opening of the high-speed
rail, the officials continued.</P>
      <P>A total of 2.08 million people took the high-speed train between Jan. 5 and
early March, officials noted, adding that the daily passenger volume averages at
33,161.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the number of passengers taking the traditional railway shrank
from 14.57 million in last December to 13.57 million in February, a drop of 6.9
percent, the officials stated.</P>
      <P>Freeway bus services saw a very small decline in the number of passengers at
0.75 percent, according to officials.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) will continue to
monitor the situation and formulate policies to minimize the impact, the

      <P>According to information released by the bank, the plot of land at Taipei's

      <P>Bank officials said such a high price was largely a result of the recent release

land containing residential  and commercial areas is expected to fall within the

    <HEADLINE>5 DETAINED IN PROBES INTO SUSPECTED INVENTEC STOCKS INSIDER TRADING</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Five people, including three vice presidents  of Inventec  Appliances  Corp.--
a local  handset manufacturing company that also produces iPod music players for
Apple Inc., were taken into custody Friday to facilitate probes into the
company's suspected involvement in insider trading.</P>
      <P>However, the company's chairman, Chang Ching-sung, who is one of the prime
targets in the suspected insider trading investigations, flew out of Taiwan two
hours before prosecutors raided the company's headquarters in Wugu, Taipei
County and the homes of several corporate executives Thursday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said they have kept a close track of Inventec Appliances Corp.'s
operations for some time, but have refrained from imposing any overseas travel
ban on the company's senior executives for fear of alerting  them and thereby
hindering  subsequent investigations.</P>
      <P>They denied that any law enforcement officer leaked information about an
impending raid on the company to any of the company's executives.</P>
      <P>Another target of probe, Inventec Appliances President Lee Chia-en, is now in
China. Prosecutors said once Chang and Lee return to Taiwan, they will be
subpoenaed for questioning.</P>
      <P>Both Lee's wife Chang Su-wei and his younger brother Lee Chia-chung have been
held in incommunicado over their suspected roles in the alleged insider trading
of the company's stocks.</P>
      <P>Also detained were the company's three vice presidents -- Chen Hung-lieh, who
concurrently serves as corporate spokesman, Chuang Chin-tai, and Tseng Ching-an
who concurrently serves as the company's chief financer.</P>
      <P>Of the 17 people who were brought back to the Panchiao Prosecutors Office for
questioning, six were released after overnight interrogations. The remaining six
were released on bail ranging between NT$5 million and NT$100,000.</P>
      <P>More than 200 prosecutors and investigators were mobilized to raid Inventec
Appliances Thursday afternoon in search for evidence supportive of charges on
insider trading.</P>
      <P>In the raid, a massive collection of corporate documents and accounting books
were also seized, prosecutors said.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Panchiao District Prosecutors Office said law enforcement
authorities launched the raid after receiving reliable information  that
pointed  to high-ranking  Inventec  managers manipulating the company's stock
prices.</P>
      <P>A large portion of Inventec Appliances turnover for last year was derived from
the popular iPod digital music player for Apple Inc., while its handset business
accounted for only about 10 percent of the company's 2006 revenues, according to
corporate accounting records.</P>
      <P>The company's business turnover for the first quarter plunged substantially,
while its work force had also been cut by more than 10 percent to about 13,817
as of the end of March.</P>
      <P>Inventec Appliances is the latest in a spate of listed technology companies
under investigation  for suspected  insider trading, following Veutron Corp., a
memory module and scanner maker in Powerchip Group, and BenQ Corp. Inventec
Appliances is 45 percent owned by computer maker Inventec Corp.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Justice (MOJ)  officials said streamlining the financial market and
cracking down on major economic crimes have been the major targets of
prosecutorial investigations over the past half year.</P>
      <P>In the future, the officials said, prosecution authorities will continue giving
priority to dealing with five types of crime, with an aim to realizing the MOJ-
set target of pursuing 40 suspected economic and financial irregularities by the
end of this year, including at least 10 definitive cases.</P>
      <P>That means that prosecutors will tackle at least four major corporate scandals
in the coming months since they have already been in an intensive quest for
alleged legal transgressions by six listed corporations in the past six months,
including Veutron, BenQ, Inventec Appliances, Rebar Group, Chinatrust Financial
Group and China Development Financial Holding Co.</P>
      <P>According to MOJ officials, the financial crimes to be cracked down will include
insider trading and stock price manipulation, embezzlement of corporate funds,
accounting fraud and illegal lending, illegal corporate mergers and takeovers,
as well as illegal private equity transactions and capital solicitation.</P>

      <P>A number of the country's grand justices are billionaires, while several others
have seen their family assets increase substantially over the past year,
according to the latest asset disclosure reports filed with the Control Yuan,
the country's supreme watchdog body.</P>
      <P>A newly published Control Yuan report shows that all grand justices have filed
their 2006 assets disclosure reports, and most of them are in clover.</P>
      <P>The report shows that Judicial Yuan President Weng Yueh-sheng, who concurrently
serves as a grand justice, ranks among the three richest grand justices in terms
of family assets. Weng's bank deposits increased NT$3.28 million to reach
NT$19.25 million at the end of last year.</P>
      <P>Weng was one of the senior government officials who came under fire last year
over alleged misuse of special allowance funds set aside for their discretionary
use. The asset disclosure report shows that Weng continued to deposit his
special allowance fund into his bank account last year.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, Weng's state bond holdings decreased by more than NT$10
million,  while his real estate holdings  remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>According to the asset disclosure report, grand justice Tseng You-tien should be
very interested in real estate investment. He reported possession of four houses
and two plots of land in metropolitan Taipei in 2005 and his real estate
holdings have increased significantly in 2006 by securing five plots of land in
Hsinchu County's Chupei City where land prices have skyrocketed in recent years
thanks to industrial development and the opening of high-speed Bullet Train
services.</P>
      <P>Grand justice Hsu Pi-hu also reported an enormous increase in family assets in
the past year. In the 2005 report, Hsu had just NT$738,544 in bank deposit plus
NT$102,181 securities holdings. In 2006, his bank deposit swelled to NT$5.67
million and his securities holdings also zoomed to NT$5.36 million.</P>
      <P>Grand justice Lai Ying-jaw posted a nearly NT$8 million increase in his bank
deposit last year, with the amount reaching NT$58.07 million at the end of 2006.
He didn't have any securities or real estate holdings.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Academia Sinica President Chi-huey Wong is also a wealthy man,
possessing a house and two plots of land in the United States in addition to
nearly NT$40 million in bank deposits and securities holdings.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Steve R.L. Chen has more than NT$13.65 million in
bank deposits, marking an increase of NT$4 million from his 2005 deposits. In
line with Premier Su Tseng-chang's demand, Chen already placed part of his stock
holdings into trust. His overall stock holdings remained almost same at NT$12.75
million, of which NT$59.49 million worth of stocks have been put into trust.</P>
      <P>According to the asset disclosure report, many of Taiwan's overseas envoys are
also wealthy. All of the 12 ambassadors or overseas representatives who filed
their annual assets disclosure reports recently possess more than NT$10 million
(US$303,030) in family assets.</P>

      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang has announced that the demolition of the Losheng
Sanatorium will be suspended and the Executive Yuan will strive to retain 90
percent of the four-hectare compound.</P>
      <P>The announcement came after Su visited the sanatorium in the northern county of
Taipei Thursday for the first time in his capacity as premier.</P>
      <P>The sanatorium was constructed in 1930 by Japanese colonizers for the
segregation and treatment of persons with Hansen's disease, and now is home to
several dozen elderly patients.</P>
      <P>One day ahead of the visit, Su received sanatorium patients and preservationists
at the Executive Yuan to discuss possible solutions.</P>
      <P>Su said at the sanatorium that the Cabinet will ask the Taipei county government
not to carry out the dismantlement as originally scheduled on April 16 to make
way for a Taipei metro depot construction project.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Su stressed that the construction project will not be postponed,
promising that the Cabinet will provide subsidies to cover the extra costs
incurred by the preservation of the sanatorium.</P>
      <P>The premier also apologized to the patients, saying that the government did not
fully realize the significance of the sanatorium and did not communicate well
with patients during the decision-making process in 1994.</P>
      <P>Su said that now engineering experts will have more time to come up with a win-
win plan respecting the needs of both sanatorium and construction project.</P>
      <P>He also urged all parties concerned to replace confrontation with communication
and to help transform Taiwan into a country that safeguards human rights and
culture.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Bank of Taiwan Friday sold by tender 11 plots of land across Taiwan, with
one in the downtown Taipei Zhongzheng  District  hitting  an  NT$880,300
(US$26,540)  per square-meter record for the district's residential area, the
bank said.</P>
      <P>According to information released by the bank, the plot of land at Taipei's
Guling Street measuring nearly a thousand"pings"- a unit of area each equaling
around 3.3057 square meters - was won by the listed Rich Development Co. Ltd
with an NT$2,789 million bid, NT$1,229 million higher than the upset price.</P>
      <P>Bank officials said such a high price was largely a result of the recent release
of the government's 12-year compulsory education policy,  because the plot of
land containing residential  and commercial areas is expected to fall within the
catchment area of the nearby, highly rated Jianguo High School.</P>
      <P>11 of the 17 plots of land available sold for a total of NT$3,132 million, bank
officials said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A number of the country's grand justices are billionaires, while several others
have seen their family assets increase substantially over the past year,
according to the latest asset disclosure reports filed with the Control Yuan,
the country's supreme watchdog body.</P>
      <P>A newly published Control Yuan report shows that all grand justices have filed
their 2006 assets disclosure reports, and most of them are in clover.</P>
      <P>The report shows that Judicial Yuan President Weng Yueh-sheng, who concurrently
serves as a grand justice, ranks among the three richest grand justices in terms
of family assets. Weng's bank deposits increased NT$3.28 million to reach
NT$19.25 million at the end of last year.</P>
      <P>Weng was one of the senior government officials who came under fire last year
over alleged misuse of special allowance funds set aside for their discretionary
use. The asset disclosure report shows that Weng continued to deposit his
special allowance fund into his bank account last year.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, Weng's state bond holdings decreased by more than NT$10
million,  while his real estate holdings  remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>According to the asset disclosure report, grand justice Tseng You-tien should be
very interested in real estate investment. He reported possession of four houses
and two plots of land in metropolitan Taipei in 2005 and his real estate
holdings have increased significantly in 2006 by securing five plots of land in
Hsinchu County's Chupei City where land prices have skyrocketed in recent years
thanks to industrial development and the opening of high-speed Bullet Train
services.</P>
      <P>Grand justice Hsu Pi-hu also reported an enormous increase in family assets in
the past year. In the 2005 report, Hsu had just NT$738,544 in bank deposit plus
NT$102,181 securities holdings. In 2006, his bank deposit swelled to NT$5.67
million and his securities holdings also zoomed to NT$5.36 million.</P>
      <P>Grand justice Lai Ying-jaw posted a nearly NT$8 million increase in his bank
deposit last year, with the amount reaching NT$58.07 million at the end of 2006.
He didn't have any securities or real estate holdings.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Academia Sinica President Chi-huey Wong is also a wealthy man,
possessing a house and two plots of land in the United States in addition to
nearly NT$40 million in bank deposits and securities holdings.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Steve R.L. Chen has more than NT$13.65 million in
bank deposits, marking an increase of NT$4 million from his 2005 deposits. In
line with Premier Su Tseng-chang's demand, Chen already placed part of his stock
holdings into trust. His overall stock holdings remained almost same at NT$12.75
million, of which NT$59.49 million worth of stocks have been put into trust.</P>
      <P>According to the asset disclosure report, many of Taiwan's overseas envoys are
also wealthy. All of the 12 ambassadors or overseas representatives who filed
their annual assets disclosure reports recently possess more than NT$10 million
(US$303,030) in family assets.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's  top labor  affairs administrator is set to arrive in Washington, D.C.
Sunday to push for the signing of a free trade agreement (FTA) between the two
countries, trade sources said Friday.</P>
      <P>Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Chairman Lee Ying-yuan will meet with Bush
administration officials, deliver speeches to U.S. think tanks and lobby
congressional support for the signing of an FTA during his visit, the sources
said.</P>
      <P>According  to the sources,  Lee will focus his talks  on labor-related topics
that are one of the U.S. major concerns in gauging whether to sign an FTA with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Previous U.S.  State Department  human rights reports have mentioned problems in
Taiwan's migrant worker management and welfare services and perks for wage
earners. Lee is expected to brief U.S. officials and think tank scholars on
Taiwan's labor policy and its efforts to improve welfare benefits for both
native wage earners and foreign laborers in the hope of "clarifying
misperceptions and misunderstandings."</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan officials stationed in Washington, D.C., the office of the
U.S. Trade Representative has never explicitly stated that Taiwan's labor
conditions are a hindrance to the signing of an FTA.</P>
      <P>The officials also said that Taiwan's Labor Standards Law provides "lofty and
adequate norms and standards" for treatment of wage earners.</P>
      <P>"We believe that Lee's briefing on our achievements in labor rights protection
will contribute to the FTA drive, " said an official from the Taiwan
representative office in Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA, John C.C. Deng, Taiwan's deputy representative to the
United States who will soon depart for home to take over as Taiwan's first top
international trade negotiator, said Lee's U.S. visit is a wise move in the
promotion of an FTA.</P>
      <P>"The push for a Taiwan-U.S. FTA requires concerted efforts of all government
departments. It would be very helpful if the heads of various administrative
agencies can come to the U.S. capital for direct dialogue with their American
counterparts, " Deng said, adding that besides  trade and labor  departments,
the Environmental Protection Administration should also send delegates to
Washington, D.C. for direct communications on Taiwan's needs.</P>
      <P>According to Lee's itinerary, he will deliver a speech April 17 on upgrading
Asian labor standards at the Center for National Policy, a U.S. think tank
dedicated to research and debate on issues of U.S. national interests. He will
also attend a seminar at the U.S. Heritage Foundation, another Washington-based
think tank.</P>
      <P>Before wrapping up his trip April 19, Lee will brief Taiwanese journalists
posted in Washington, D.C. on the purposes and accomplishments of his visit.</P>

that the president to be elected in 2008 should be a non-partisan politician and
he urged possible candidates to work toward ending the bitter strife among the
various political parties.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks while leading a group of nuclear-free activists in
distributing leaflets in Taichung City, central Taiwan, to solicit support for
his campaign to seek revisions to the Referendum Law.</P>
      <P>Lin claims that a cap in the Referendum Law makes proposing a referendum and
passing it very difficult.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that the law stipulates that a referendum proposal should obtain the
endorsement of more than 5 percent of the country's citizens, much higher than
the 1.5 percent required to present a presidential candidate.</P>
      <P>Lin's ultimate goal is to allow the public to have a say in deciding the future
of the country's Fourth Nuclear Power Plant. He has been a staunch  supporter
of the policy to make Taiwan nuclear-free.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the implementation of referendums will be the next step in
Taiwan's democratization.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the fighting among the political parties, Lin said it is no
surprise, especially when elections are approaching.</P>
      <P>Saying that a reduction of political conflicts is vital for the presidential
election in 2008, Lin called for the election of a supra-party leader who can
contribute to benign competition among the political parties rather than to fuel
more partisan confrontation.</P>
      <P>Lin said he has no plans to run in the 2008 election himself, but he did not
totally exclude the option of running in the future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO TIMETABLE FOR RESUMPTION OF NEW ZEALAND APPLE IMPORTS: COA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 14 (CNA)

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There is no timetable on any resumption of New Zealand apple imports to Taiwan,
an official of the Council of Agriculture (COA) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Yeh Ying, deputy director of COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection
and Quarantine, made the remarks after Taiwan suspended New Zealand apple
imports due to a codling moth larvae found in a batch of New Zealand apples that
arrived Thursday at Taichung Harbor, central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 1,029 cartons of Fuji apples from New Zealand were determined to have failed
the quarantine inspection.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the COA notified the New Zealand Commerce and Industrial Office in
Taipei and that the office sent staff to investigate the matter.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan will decide when to resume imports of New Zealand apples after reviewing
its progress in the eradication of agriculture pests," she said.</P>
      <P>According to regulations concerning the handling of apples imported from
countries and regions with codling moths, the contaminated apples will be either
returned or destroyed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will also temporarily suspend imports of New Zealand apples until
Wellington looks into the reasons for the pest's presence, adopts measures to
improve inspections and notifies Taiwan that it is free of codling moths. Until
such steps are taken, its apples will not be allowed to enter Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yeh noted that the codling moth lays eggs on apples and the larvae feed on the
fruit, burrowing into the fruit before leaving to overwinter and pupate
elsewhere.</P>
      <P>If the moth adapts to Taiwan's climate, it could attack apples, pears and
peaches, causing great damage, Yeh added.</P>
      <P>She pointed out that the United States has imported a lot of tropical fruit from
Central and Southern America, which often carries the Mediterranean fruit fly,
so that California and Florida see their fruit crops affected from time to time.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has no Mediterranean fruit fly, but does have the oriental fruit fly,
which affects more than 30 fruits. Taiwan fruit has therefore to be fumigated
before export to kill any oriental fruit fly larvae.</P>
      <P>Statistics show that in 2006, apples from New Zealand accounted for 12.3 percent
of all apples imported into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has imported New Zealand apples for more than a decade, and this is the
first time that codling moth has been found, COA officials said. Taiwan has not
found this pest in apples from other countries this year, COA officials added.</P>

      <P>All of the Taiwan medical aid workers aboard a stricken Taiwanese fishing boat
that hit a reef while conducting relief work for tsunami victims in the Solomon
Islands have been rescued, a diplomatic official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Wang Chien-yeh, a U.S.
Navy helicopter lifted 20 people off the grounded Yufa 201, including four
Taiwanese medical workers.</P>
      <P>The aid workers were sent by the Taiwan International Health Action (Taiwan
IHA), an ad hoc inter-agency body founded by the MOFA and the Department  of
Health  early last year to help with international disaster relief work.</P>
      <P>Quoting Republic of China Ambassador to the Solomon Islands George Chan, Wang
said the Taiwanese fishing vessel had been returning to the western town of Gizo
after delivering aid supplies to the Pacific island nation's outlying islands
Friday when it hit a reef.</P>
      <P>Chan immediately asked the Solomon Islands authorities to arrange for a rescue,
Wang said, adding that the U.S. chopper helped lift the Red Cross workers and
the Taiwan IHA team off the ship. "We were told that our aid workers were safely
evacuated, " Wang said, adding that they have returned to Honiara, capital of
the Solomon Islands.</P>
      <P>Also rescued from the ship were 13 Red Cross workers from New Zealand and the
Solomon Islands, as well as two patients and an injured Yufa crew member, he
said.</P>
      <P>The other crewmen remained on the grounded vessel, Wang said, adding that Chan
asked the Solomon Islands' maritime disaster relief center to seek the
assistance of Malaysian ships operating in the region to help tow the Yufa to a
nearby port for repair.</P>
      <P>The accident came as the Solomon Islands declared April 23 a national day of
mourning for 43 people killed when a magnitude-8.1 earthquake triggered a
tsunami that crashed through coastal villages earlier this month. Another 7,000
people have been left homeless. Taiwan has donated funds and sent personnel to

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers of the opposition Kuomintang explain how alleged graft involving its
official will affect the country's future competitiveness, and apologize to the
public.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus whips made the call at a press conference at the
Legislative Yuan after prosecutors discovered that the "M-Taiwan" broadband
Internet network construction project, one of the government's 10 new major
national construction programs, might have been stained by graft. The project
includes a broadband channel construction plan aimed at overcoming the
"LastMile" establishment challenge.</P>
      <P>The MOI's Construction and Planning Agency (CPA) has budgeted NT$30 billion
(US$906.48 million) to subsidize local governments in "fanning out" broadband
wires and cables for the "LastMile" project.</P>
      <P>The suspected malfeasance was discovered during an investigation by the Taipei
District Prosecutors Office and the Civil Service Ethics Department under the
Ministry of Justice into another graft allegation involving CPA official Chang
Ho-ping.</P>
      <P>Chang was detained Friday on suspicion of allowing certain contractors to make
profits after receiving dinner invitations from them.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hsu Shao-ping, a KMT caucus whip, said the "M-Taiwan" plan, with its
government budget of over NT$60 billion and numerous trading opportunities, has
become a machine that is vacuuming "sweat money" out of the pockets of the
public.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, the "M-Taiwan" project is aimed at establishing a high-quality
broadband Internet network throughout the country to provide cheap high-speed
Internet connection services in efforts to boost the production value of
Taiwan's telecommunication sector.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Joanna Lei pointed out that the project, comprised of many
smaller construction programs, has being carried out on loans of more than NT$60
billion.</P>
      <P>Out of concern that Chang might be guilty of other similar malpractice while
serving as the head of the CPA public construction division, the KMT legislative
caucus urged the Executive Yuan to take steps to cleanse all other major public
construction projects of graft.</P>
      <P>In response to the call, Executive Yuan spokeswoman Chen Mei-ling said the
alleged graft case will not affect the "M-Taiwan" project, which is being
implemented as scheduled.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the prosecution has begun a probe into the case and said if
evidence shows the CPA official had actually accepted improper dining
invitations, it would be "only his personal conduct."</P>

      <P>Lawmakers from the ruling and opposition parties traded barbs Saturday over the
soon-to-be  inaugurated Taiwanese chamber of commerce in China.</P>
      <P>Legislators from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) asked if the
establishment of the first national-level association of Taiwan businessmen
investing in China is scheduled Monday to coincide with a China visit by Lien
Chan, honorary chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), that day.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Gao Jyh-peng asked if this means that the KMT is singing a duet
with the Communist Party of China (CPC) to help the latter's "united front"
campaign against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Gao noted that Chang Han-wen, a Taiwanese businessman operating in Guangdong
Province in southern China who headed a supporters group for Lien's presidential
bid in the 2004 presidential election, will serve as the chairman of the group.</P>
      <P>High-ranking Chinese officials will also play roles in the association, Gao
said, noting that Chen Yunlin, the director of China's Taiwan Affairs Office
under the State Council, has been chosen to serve as honorary chairman of the
new organization, while He Shizong, director of the office's Economic Bureau,
will be the group's vice chairman and secretary-general.</P>
      <P>Gao said that Lien has only announced his itinerary for one day in China and
asked what he plans to do for the remaining days of his stay in China.</P>
      <P>Lien's visit reportedly will mainly be to attend the third Cross-Strait Economic
and Cultural Forum in Beijing from April 28-29 and to meet Chinese President Hu
Jintao.</P>
      <P>"China has obviously completed its scheme to control Taiwanese businessmen
investing in China," Gao said.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Kao Chien-chih claimed that the KMT has promoted absentee voting
in the legislature in an attempt to collaborate with the CPC and is using every
means to try to win the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>But Hsu Shao-ping, KMT caucus whip in the legislature, pointed out that this is
not Lien's first trip to China and said that if the DPP is pointing fingers
whenever KMT officials visit China, the government "should not discuss cross-
strait policy any more."</P>
      <P>She also claimed that the KMT is promoting absentee voting mainly for those
voters in Taiwan who cannot make it to polling stations and not for Taiwanese
businessmen operating in China.</P>
      <P>She cited the examples of policemen, military personnel, jail wardens and
election officials who sometimes cannot vote because of their work. As for
Taiwan businessmen in China.  the KMT is considering pushing for charter flights
for them to make it easier for them to return to Taiwan to vote in elections,
she added.</P>

      <P>Activists dedicated to saving the Losheng leprosarium said Saturday that
officials of the United Nations and the U.S. State Department have promised to
lobby support for the survival of the sanatorium.</P>
      <P>Members of the patients' self-help organization made the remarks at a press
conference held at the Legislative Yuan after concluding a trip to the U.N.
headquarters and the U.S. State Department in the last two weeks.</P>
      <P>The activists said they were soliciting support to preserve 90 percent of the
4-hectare Losheng leprosarium as previously promised by the Cabinet, which is at
odds with the Taipei county government on the matter. The county government
plans to demolish the sanatorium, which was built during Japanese colonial rule
of Taiwan, to make way for a metro construction project.</P>
      <P>Yang You-jen, leader of the lobbying delegation, noted that the government has
been expressing its hope of entering the U.N. and the World Health Organization
(WHO) during the last decade. However, Yang claimed that it has been violating
U.N. and WHO practice regarding the settlement of lepers.</P>
      <P>The government's move not only runs counter to the world trend of protecting
patients' rights, but also goes against the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's promise to protect human rights, Yang claimed.</P>
      <P>Other members of the lobbying group said the preservation of the Losheng
leprosarium is now not only a matter for Taiwan, but has attracted much
attention from around the world due to the historical and cultural value of the
sanatorium. They urged Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei not to continue
"bullying" less-privileged citizens in exchange for commercial development.</P>
      <P>Chou claimed that the decision to tear down the sanatorium was made by Premier
Su Tseng-chang during his tenure as Taipei county magistrate and that Su decided
to change his past policy simply because he is planning to run in the 2008

      <P>The four presidential aspirants of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
might differ on many issues, but they all agree that Taiwan is a sovereign,
independent country that should not unify with China.</P>
      <P>The four hopefuls -- Vice President Annette Lu, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun,
Premier Su Tseng-chang and former Premier Frank Hsieh -- echoed the views in
response to questions on whether they favor unification with China and on their
views on promoting the nation's diplomatic work, in the first of two forums
sponsored by the DPP to give the public a chance to hear a little about their
respective platforms.</P>
      <P>Yu said unification with China is not an option and that it would mean Taiwan
being swallowed up by China and being relegated to a province.</P>
      <P>He also said Taiwan enjoys important strategic value and should forge alliances
with other democratic countries.</P>
      <P>"There should be an Asia-Pacific strategy before a China strategy," he added.</P>
      <P>Su said Taiwan's future should be decided by its people and that no Taiwanese
will favor unification with China. If elected president, he will continue to
push for Taiwan-centric consciousness, he added.</P>
      <P>Su also said that although Taiwan maintains diplomatic relations with only 24
countries, Taiwan's economic muscle should help it on the difficult diplomatic
front.</P>
      <P>Hsieh claimed that Ma Ying-jeou, former chairman of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) and the most likely bet of the party in the 2008 presidential
election, is now echoing the DPP's long-standing stance that Taiwan's future
should be decided by its people.</P>
      <P>But he said the distinction between the DPP and the KMT is that that the former
advocates moving toward independence, while the KMT advocates eventual
unification with China.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that although the number of countries that maintain diplomatic ties
with Taiwan is limited, Taiwan has a vibrant economy that will help it seek a
diplomatic breakthrough amid China's relentless obstruction.</P>
      <P>Lu said that there is no question about Taiwan being a sovereign, independent
country, noting that its first popular presidential election was held in 1996.</P>
      <P>She also said that democracy is what makes Taiwan stands out and that the nation
should promote its democratic ideals, which, combined with the vibrant private
sector, will make Taiwan shine in the international community.</P>

Wall Street Journal:Panel Ties CA Founder to Huge Fraud

A special committee of the board of directors has accused Charles Wang, founder
and former chairman of Computer Associates International Inc., of directing and
participating in fraudulent accounting during the 1980s and 1990s.

The committee's report, filed late Friday afternoon in Chancery Court in
Delaware, is the first investigation that publicly ties Mr. Wang to what the
government has described as a $2.2 billion accounting fraud. The committee
recommended that the Islandia, N.Y., software company, which has changed its
name to CA Inc., file suit to recover at least $500 million from Mr. Wang in
costs related to his conduct, including a $225 million payment CA made to a

Tseng-chang and former Premier Frank Hsieh -- who are bidding to represent the
party in the 2008 election. Each hopeful had six minutes to present their
political ideas and administrative plans followed by a question-and-answer
session.</P>
      <P>During the session, Minister without Portfolio Fu Li-yen brought up three
questions concerning social welfare practice -- asking what are the DPP's core
ideas in the promotion of social policies and what are the hopefuls' core ideas
on the issue, as well as what kinds of social welfare would they promote as
priority if elected in 2008.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, a former premier, said the DPP government has placed social welfare, care
for the less-privileged, economic growth, social fairness and justice as
priorities. He said economic growth, social justice and fairness, as well as
culture and environment, should be treated equally in the formation of social
welfare policies.</P>
      <P>He said that while serving as premier, he raised the government stipend for
elderly farmers from NT$4,000 (US$120) per month to NT$5,000. However, the
stipend is still smaller than a similar subsidy of NT$13,000 for veterans.</P>
      <P>If he wins the presidential election, Hsieh said he will make efforts to push
for the legislation of a national pension system to ensure more equitable
distribution of national resources, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Yu, who served as premier from 2002 to early 2005, said that during his
premiership, a draft national pension bill was referred to the legislature but
has since been shelved due to partisan strife. According to that bill, a monthly
pension of NT$7,500 was proposed for every retiree. As social conditions change,
he said, the amount is now no longer able to support a pensioner. Against this
backdrop, he adovated that the pension be raised to NT$10,000 per month.</P>
      <P>Yu also proposed a "Happiness in Taiwan" program during the presentation as part
of efforts to promote a so-called green economy.</P>
      <P>Lu, the only female presidential aspirant in the DPP, spoke of the "Good
Housekeeping Project" she put forward in 2005 and which was adopted by the
Council for Economic Planning and Development in April 2006 to provide women
with training in care for the elderly, child care, and home management to
enhance their employment opportunities as professional housekeepers for working
mothers.</P>
      <P>Lu also said if she becomes president in 2008, she will try to resolve problems
including a dropping birth rate, which is changing the population structure of
the country.</P>
      <P>The problem of the aging society was also touched upon by Su, who revealed that
Taiwan has currently 2.29 million senior citizens aged over 65, over 200,000 of
whom suffer from dementia.</P>
      <P>If he is elected president, Su said, he will continue efforts to implement the
ongoing "Mega Investment, Mega Warmth" project covering care for the elderly and
less-privileged.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN URGED TO STRESS DEMOCRATIC VALUES</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Academics  at  a  seminar  on Taiwan-Japan-China ties said Saturday that Taiwan
should show more concern toward democratization in other countries while
strengthening democratic alliances with the United States and Japan.</P>
      <P>They made the remarks at a seminar held in Taipei the day after Chinese Premier
Wen Jiabao concluded a three-day "ice-melting" trip to Japan, in which Wen and
his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe pledged to strengthen bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Lo Fu-chuan, chairman of the Association of East Asia Relations, a quasi-
official organization established to deal with Japan on behalf of Republic of
China government in the absence of diplomatic ties, noted that relations among
Taiwan, Japan and China are an important part of Asia's interaction.</P>
      <P>Recently, Japan has put more effort into getting involved in Asian affairs and
has established closer ties with the United States, India and the countries of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations,  focusing  especially  on  their
common  values  in democratization.</P>
      <P>Lee Ming-chun, deputy secretary-general of the Taiwanese Society of
International Law, claimed there is no more hegemony in Asia, where China,
Japan, India and Australia all play important roles.</P>
      <P>China and Japan need to ponder a new policy in the face of the changing Asian
situation, while Taiwan should not focus foreign ties only with Japan, the U.S.
and China, but should instead develop diverse relations.</P>
      <P>Lin Cheng-yi, a researcher of the Institute of European and American Studies
under the Academia Sinica, said ties between Taiwan and Japan have been well
maintained since the Democratic Progressive Party took power and he called on
the government to continue strengthening relations with Japan.</P>
      <P>Tamkang University Associate Professor Chang Wu-yueh said Taiwan should consider
how to keep its economic advantage amid the growing call for Asian integration.</P>
      <P>He suggested that Taiwan show more concern to other countries' democratic
development, especially China, adding that only when the two countries reach
consensus in democracy can peaceful relations between the two be assured.</P>
      <P>Saying that Japan-China and Taiwan-Japan relations are not a zero-sum game, Loh
Chih-cheng, a professor at Soochow University, said he sees no need for Japan to
sacrifice Taiwan's interests in exchange for an improvement of its ties with
China.</P>
      <P>According to a recent survey, the people of both Taiwan and Japan see each other
as friendly countries, which Loh described as an important fundamental for
Taiwan-Japan relations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Major pro-Taiwan independence groups organized a protest march in downtown
Taipei Saturday to push for TVBS cable TV station to shut down and pull out of
the Taiwan media market over what they called the station's repeated
unprofessional news reporting.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of their supporters were gathered in front of the Control Yuan and then
marched through several major streets to reach TVBS head office on Pateh Road
where they staged skits to mock the station and urge it to bow out of the local
media market.</P>
      <P>The leader of the demonstration, Peter Wang, also read to Premier Su Tseng-chang
a statement carrying three demands for the Executive Yuan -- to apologize for
its mishandling of TVBS, to terminate the operations  of the  "unconstitutional"
National  Communications Commission and to suspend the licenses of television
stations owned partially or fully by China.</P>
      <P>Wang also accused TVBS of having served as China's spokesman in Taiwan by
frequently making false accusations against government leaders and broadcasting
staged footage to disturb public order.</P>
      <P>The organizing  groups included the Taiwan Association  of University
Professors, the 908 Taiwan Republic Campaign and the Taiwan Association for 228
Peace Promotion. Some legislators and city and county councilors  from the
ruling Democratic  Progressive Party-led "pan-green" camp also took part in the
demonstration.</P>
      <P>A TVBS spokesman refused to comment on the demands but called on the Taipei city
government for better consideration on the impact of the protest on businesses
in the area and on rights of TVBS employees.</P>

      <P>As long as Taiwan's democracy and trade continue to grow, "problems will solve
themselves," a visiting former U.S. congressional leader said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Henry Hyde, a former chairman of the U.S. House International Relations
Committee, made the remarks while talking with a number of reporters at his
hotel room in Taipei, where he was to attend a Sunday  conference  to be
organized  by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party on Taiwan's
democratization.</P>
      <P>Asked for comments on Taiwan's constitutional re-engineering plan, Hyde said
that rewriting a new constitution will "present serious problems" as it will
increase the tension across Taiwan Strait. He suggested that amendments that
bear no military or geopolitical consequences and are highly domestic may be
easier accepted as not being a challenge to the status quo.</P>
      <P>An active supporter of Taiwan's bid to negotiate a free trade agreement (FTA)
with the U.S. during his congressional term, Hyde said a U.S.-Taiwan FTA is
inevitable though he did not know how soon will that be in place.</P>
      <P>He said things are changing and there needs no hurry. "Just be patient and keep
things in balance."</P>
      <P>Hyde praised Taiwan's democratic and economic achievement, saying that in Asia
"Taiwan is a shining example of progress and stability within the context of a
vigorous democracy."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he reminded Taiwan that China's military buildup is worrisome and has
the potential to change the status quo. He urged Taiwan to strengthen its self-
defense.</P>

      <P>U.S. President George W. Bush's attitude toward President Chen Shui-bian formed
out of Chen's unexpected "one country on each side" talk in 2002 remains a major
obstacle in bilateral relations, a former aid to U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney
suggested Sunday. Stephen Yates, former deputy assistant to Cheney for national
security affairs from 2001V2005, made the remark at an international seminar
held by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party on Taiwan' democratization.</P>
      <P>In the seminar as well as a conference session that went before it, the
hesitation  on the part  of the United  States  and international community to
give a helping hand to the democratic Taiwan squeezed by a rising China was a
central concern.</P>
      <P>Hao Pei-chih, a public administration scholar from National Taipei University,
said Taiwan's people have a sense of frustration over the country's current
situation, especially in comparison with South Korea, as the United States is
still hesitant to negotiate a free trade agreement with Taiwan. She wanted to
know why.</P>
      <P>Yates said he personally feel that the United States at this point has "an
attitude towards Taiwan, not a policy or strategy". He said that Chen's talk of
both sides of Taiwan Straits as "one country on each side" caught Washington off
guard when the top level of the U.S. government was in intensive discussion and
debate over the plans to invade Iraq and China loomed as a very important factor
to consider.</P>
      <P>He said Chen's remark came to U.S. government as a sudden newspaper story rather
than an advanced notice through diplomatic channels or a part of public debate
ongoing for some time, and that irritated Bush.</P>
      <P>Yates said Bush is hard to change his mind once he has had judgement for
someone, and Chen was since labeled. He said similar incidents repeated again
and again and that has some impact on the way the administration treats Taiwan.
But Lo Chih-cheng, Chairman of the Department of Political Science of Soochow
University, said sometimes "surprises" may be good. "If Taiwan's going to do
something anyway because of some domestic forces," then it is better not to
communicate with the U.S. to avoid embarrassment both sides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW ROC ENVOY TO U.S. ARRIVES IN WASHINGTON TO ASSUME POST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 15 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's new representative to the United States, Joseph Wu, arrived to a warm
welcome in Washington, D.C. Sunday to assume his post.</P>
      <P>Over 100 Taiwanese expatriates, along with Taiwan officials stationed in the
United States and officials from the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), the de
facto U.S. embassy in Taiwan, met Wu at the airport, welcoming the first Taiwan
representative to the United States from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP).</P>
      <P>Overwhelmed by the warm welcome from the Taiwanese expatriates who came from all
around the greater Washington and Baltimore areas to greet him, Wu said he will
do his utmost during his stint in Washington to safeguard the interests of
Taiwan and its people.</P>
      <P>Wu said he is pleased to be the first DPP representative in the United States
but stressed that he is representing Taiwan, the Republic of China, and its 23
million people and will handle U.S.-Taiwan relations based on the principle of
protecting and promoting Taiwan's interests to the greatest degree.</P>
      <P>On the issue of the DPP administration's seeking constitutional reform to
facilitate a Taiwan name rectification plan, Wu said this is part of the
progress that Taiwan must make in its democratization process, adding that he
will keep the U.S. authorities informed of all relevant developments.</P>
      <P>Wu said that topping his agenda in Washington will be enhancing communications
with U.S.  authorities over the ever-increasing political lobbying efforts by
China on Capitol Hill, adding that he will try to bolster Taiwan's preparedness
in this regard and also try to increase Taiwan's influence in the U.S. Congress.</P>
      <P>Wu, who was Taiwan's top China policy planner before being assigned by President
Chen Shui-bian to be the country's new representative in Washington, said that
in the face of China's rapid military expansion and economic rise, Taiwan must
be more aggressive and adopt pragmatic strategies to let the international
community better understand Taiwan and its situation.</P>
      <P>Wu said he believes that his background as Mainland Affairs Council head should
make him more persuasive when it comes to dialogue with U.S. friends over issues
concerning cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>As to Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Organization (WHO) -- a longstanding
goal that has yet to be realized due to China's obstruction, Wu said he will try
his utmost to seek the United States' support and understanding, particularly
regarding the unfair treatment that the Taiwan people have faced by being
excluded from the world health regulatory body.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that only the 23 million people of Taiwan are not represented in the
WHO -- a fact that is "unarguably unjust for the Taiwan people."</P>
      <P>Consequently, he said, relevant Taiwan officials must seek more pragmatic means
to let the Taiwan people have access to the WHO and its activities on a more
equal footing.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, AIT Managing Director Barbara Jane Schrage, who welcomed Wu in person
upon his arrival at the airport, said the U.S. government welcomes Wu with open
arms and believes that given his backround and experience, he will be a capable
representative just like his predecessors.</P>

      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh said Monday that public opinion polls conducted by
his own camp show that he is ahead of other ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) hopefuls bidding to represent the party in the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that he will not comment on public opinion polls conducted by the
media which also showed that he is ahead but that polls conducted by his camp
show he is leading the other three DPP presidential hopefuls, namely Vice
President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun.</P>
      <P>"The public opinion polls go up and down, and as the leading contender, I'll
deal with them with humility."</P>
      <P>On other hopefuls' questions regarding the results of his camp's polls, Hsieh
said that if they have any doubts, they can conduct their own public opinion
polls.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks during a visit to a center for physically and mentally
challenged children in Taichung, central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the DPP's primary mechanism, a party member vote will be held in
early May, with the results accounting for 30 percent of the hopefuls' final
score, followed by a series of public opinion polls, whose results will account
for 70 percent of the hopefuls' final score. The party's presidential candidate
will be announced May 30.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's  top labor  affairs administrator, Lee Ying-yuan, arrived in
Washington, D.C. Sunday to clarify and explain Taiwan's labor policy as part of
efforts to pave the way for the signing of a free trade agreement (FTA) between
the two countries.</P>
      <P>Speaking outside the airport upon his arrival in the U.S. capital, Lee, chairman
of the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA), said this is the first time that a Taiwan
official in charge of labor affairs has come to Washington for talks on labor-
related topics which are one of the United States' major concerns in gauging
whether to sign an FTA with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Prior to Lee's visit, only officials in charge of economic and trade affairs had
traveled to Washington for similar talks.</P>
      <P>Lee said Taiwan has advanced regulations governing management and welfare
services for both local and migrant workers employed in Taiwan and completed
related legislation over the past several years, adding that Taiwan's Labor
Standards Law now provides "lofty and adequate norms and standards" for
treatment of wage earners.</P>
      <P>Lee said that he attaches great importance to his visit in Washington during
which he will exchange views with the Bush administration officials, think-tank
specialists and members of the U.S. Congress. He added that the current members
of the U.S. Congress have payed closer attention to labor affairs and
environmental protection issues than their predecessors had.</P>
      <P>During his visit, Lee is also expected to brief U.S. officials and think tank
scholars on Taiwan's labor policy and its efforts to improve welfare benefits
for both domestic wage earners and foreign laborers in the hopes of "clearing up
any misconceptions  or misunderstandings."</P>
      <P>He added that an FTA between Taiwan and the United States will help shore up the
volume of two-way trade between the two countries, which will in turn generate
more job opportunities in the industrial sectors of the two sides.</P>
      <P>Lee, who once served as Taiwan's deputy representative in the United States,
would not disclose exactly which U.S. officials he is scheduled to meet with,
only saying that all such meetings are being arranged by the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Representative Office in Washington.</P>
      <P>According to Lee's itinerary, he will deliver a speech Tuesday on upgrading
Asian labor standards at the Center for National Policy, a U.S. think tank
dedicated to research and debate on issues concerning U.S. national interests.
He will also attend a seminar at the U.S. Heritage Foundation, another
Washington-based think tank. Before wrapping up his trip Thursday, Lee will
brief Taiwanese journalists posted in Washington, D.C. on the purposes and
accomplishments of his visit.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A dust storm from China began affecting Taiwan's air quality in the early hours
of Monday, with the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) detecting a
surging density of air particles in the areas north of Taoyuan, EPA officials
said, warning that the air particle density is expected to reach its peak at
around 5:00 p.m.</P>
      <P>EPA technician Chang Shun-chin said the particle density at 10 a.m. was measured
to be 133 micrograms per cubic meter on Kinmen Island, 85 micrograms per cubic
meter in Wanli in Taipei County, northern Taiwan, and 69 micrograms per cubic
meter on Yangmingshan in suburban Taipei City, much higher than usual.</P>
      <P>The particle density was usually at the level of around 40 micrograms per cubic
meter in Wanli, and about 10 micrograms per cubic meter on Yangmingshan, Chang
said. He forecast that the air particle density in Taipei City could reach as
high as 250 micrograms per cubic meter Monday afternoon.</P>
      <P>While the movement of a high atmospheric pressure system from China passing
across Taiwan has been slowing down, the dust storm is expected to continue
affecting the island's air quality until Wednesday morning, the EPA officials
said, advising people to wear gauze masks when heading outdoors.</P>
      <P>They also advised that the elderly and young people refrain from engaging in any
outdoor activities over the next two days.</P>

      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng brushed aside Monday speculation that he
has agreed to form a presidential ticket with former opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
chief Ma Ying-jeou for the 2008 presidential election, saying that a final
settlement is still far way off.</P>
      <P>Wang, also a member of the main opposition KMT, made the comments at the
Legislative Yuan while answering questions from reporters. His remarks came
after Ma said a day earlier that a KMT presidential ticket has been in place
following a March 7 meeting during which he and Wang agreed to invite each other
to team up on a ticket if either is nominated by the party as presidential
candidate.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, Chan Chun-po, manager of his presidential campaign, paid a

legislative speaker.</P>
      <P>In response to Ma's claim that a KMT presidential ticket of himself and Wang has

      <P>The formation of a ticket between Ma and Wang is expected by KMT supporters who
are gravely concerned that a split would boost the chances of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party in the next presidential contest.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Monday that election gambits will increase in the
run-up to the presidential primary of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) in May, but that he is sure voters will make their own judgments.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks following a local cable television report last
Friday that another presidential hopeful, former Premier Frank Hsieh, is leading
in test public opinion polls conducted by the "pan-green camp" led by the DPP.</P>
      <P>In an interview with a local radio station, Su said that all kinds of election
gambits will come out before the party's primary with the intention of
undermining rivals and strengthening the candidates' own camps.</P>
      <P>The media also has its own stance, which is evident to discerning eyes, Su
added.</P>
      <P>Su said that he has experience about the unreliability of public opinion polls,
noting that he won the election for Taipei county magistrate in 1997, despite
public opinion polls showing that he was lagging behind by more than 10 percent.</P>
      <P>He noted that he has insisted on not verbally attacking other rivals and said
the voters will make their decisions based on the character and style of each
presidential hopeful.</P>
      <P>DPP sources said a recent spat over who is leading among the DPP presidential
hopefuls, who include Vice President Annette Lu, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and
former Premier Frank Hsieh, is aimed at swaying DPP members, hoping that they
will eventually cast their votes for the leading contender, even though DPP
member votes only account for 30 percent of the hopeful's final score, while a
series of public opinion polls will account for 70 percent.</P>
      <P>The DPP will announce its candidate May 30.</P>
      <P>Su also took the opportunity to defend himself over recent controversy
surrounding a planned demolition of the Losheng Sanitarium in Taipei County and
the planned construction of a freeway linking Suao and Hualien.</P>
      <P>He said his new goal is to preserve 90 percent of the leprosarium and not to
postpone a scheduled opening of a mass rapid transit line through the complex.</P>
      <P>On criticism of this policy flip-flop, Su noted that the route of a MRT line
passing through the leprosarium was planned in 1994 during the previous
Kuomintang administration, and that he only held the office of Taipei county
magistrate until December 1997. Su ruled in December 2002 that the leprosarium
would not be designated a historical site and last month rejected a suggestion
by the Council for Cultural Affairs that 90 percent of the complex be preserved.</P>
      <P>Su said that both Yu and Hsieh clearly stated during their stints as premier
that the matter should be left for coordination between Taipei city and county.</P>
      <P>"There is no need to point fingers at others," Su said, adding that as a
premier, he has to tackle the problem.</P>
      <P>He also claimed that major construction projects and environmental protection
cannot co-exist. President Chen Shui-bian first floated the idea of a freeway
linking Suao and Hualien when he was campaigning for president, Su said, adding
that Yu suspended the construction project because of disputes over its impact
on the environment. His predecessor Hsieh did not retract the project, although
he proposed an alternative project, Su continued.</P>
      <P>He said that as long as the project passes an environmental impact assessment,
it will be continued.</P>

      <P>The Shihlin District in northern Taipei City has geared up to apply to join the
Asia-Pacific Alliance for Healthy Cities under the framework of the World Health
Organization, a Taipei city government official said Monday.</P>
      <P>A Shihlin Healthy Cities Alliance Bid Promotion Association was established
Monday by 80 individuals and organizations from the district to help push for
inclusion in the regional healthy cities alliance, said Teng Su-wen, deputy
director of the city's Department of Health.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the association is aimed at building partnerships and civil
participation among the alliance members, Teng said.</P>
      <P>She continued that the formation of the alliance was aimed at improving the
quality of life in urban communities. It was also aimed at reaffirming that
health is a fundamental right and that the attainment of the highest possible
level of health requires action by many sectors and that recognizing
urbanization as a worldwide phenomenon, she added.</P>
      <P>Teng added that the association  is scheduled to file an application with the
Asia-Pacific Alliance for Healthy Cities in June.</P>
      <P>She said that the Shihlin District -- which has the top ratio of "green land"
accessibility and availability to district residents among all Taipei districts
-- is blessed with the world-renowned National Palace Museum, Yangmingshan
National Park, the Zhishanyan Prehistoric Site, the former presidential
residence and a large number of trails for hiking -- only a few of many other
worthy factors that make the district seen as a great place to live.</P>
      <P>The Taipei city government will help push for the district's membership of the
alliance along with that of the Beitou District this year, while seeking
membership of the Songshan, Zhongshan and Wanhua districts next year, Teng said.</P>
      <P>She added that Da-an last year became the first Taipei district to be admitted
into the alliance, which currently has 62 member cities from over 10 countries
and areas in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>

      <P>Japan should cooperate with Taiwan to face up to threat from China, a Taiwan
official said in an article carried in Monday's Sankei Shimbun newspaper.</P>
      <P>Tung Chen-yuan, vice chairman of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council warned in the
article that China was eyeing Japan when it fired a missile to destroy a defunct
orbiting satellite Jan. 11.</P>
      <P>Tung noted that the missile was fired one day after Japanese Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe asked the European Union not to lift its boycott on arms sales to
China and two days after Tokyo upgraded its Defense Agency to a Cabinet-level
ministry.</P>
      <P>China, which has already deployed more than 1,000 missiles aimed at Taiwan,
continues building up its military force rapidly, showing that Beijing is aiming
at countries other than Taiwan, according to Tung.</P>
      <P>Tung said he is surprised that Tokyo is worried about the threat posed by North
Korea while ignoring the more serious threat posed by Beijing.</P>
      <P>Tung said Tokyo should cooperate with Taipei to cope with both North Korea and
China.</P>

      <P>With the firefly breeding season about to enter full swing, sightseeing visits
to Lienhuache, a popular firefly conservation spot in Yuche township of Nantou
County, central Taiwan, will be restricted from late April as part of efforts to
protect the insects from human disturbance, Taiwan Forestry Research Institute
(TFRI) officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lienhuache, surrounded by wetlands and old agricultural land where farming
activity has not been carried out for many years, is listed as a national
treasure because of its abundant and various natural resources. Over the years,
the TFRI has worked with local people to revive creeks and forests around
Lienhuache, an effort that has proved successful, as the number of lightening
bugs has been growing there, TFRI official Wu Chun-hsiung said.</P>
      <P>Attracted by the glowworms, more and more tourists are visiting the Lienhuache
area during the insect's breeding season in April and May, Wu said, adding that
to protect them from human disturbance, the Lienhuache creek conservation
association has since last year taken measures to restrict tourist visits to
Lienhuache during the "Firefly Festival."</P>
      <P>In 2006, more than 10,000 tourists visited Lienhuache to capture the beauty of a
night lit by the insect, which only lives in clean natural environments,
according to the TFRI.</P>
      <P>Wu said those who want to drive to Lienhuache must park in Yuche's Wutsun
village, where the association provides services for firefly visitors, including
lectures on the bug's life and how to visit the insects without disturbing them.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP TO PUSH FOR COMBINING NATIONAL REFERENDUM, PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Presidential Office, the Executive Yuan and the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) will push for holding a national referendum in tandem
with the 2008 presidential election, DPP acting Chairman Trong Chai said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chai said that holding a national referendum on such issues as retrieving the
ill-gotten assets of the main opposition Kuomintang and joining the United
Nations under the name of Taiwan simultaneously with the presidential election
will save money and raise the turnout rate for a national referendum.</P>
      <P>Other democratic countries such as the United States have adopted such an
approach, he said.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Su Chun-ping dismissed the DPP suggestion as an election gambit
and said: "We despise their intention."</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator and Policy Committee Executive Director Tseng Yung-chuan said
that the Organic Law of the Central Election Commission (CEC) is yet to be
passed in the legislature, but the CEC will be able to decide on whether to
combine the elections in line with the wishes of the DPP administration, which
he said will not conform to "election justice."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung said that President Chen Shui-
bian discussed the issue with officials last year and reached a consensus on
holding legislative elections and the presidential election in the same year,
claiming that doing so would not involve revising the law and would only require
an Executive Yuan decision.</P>
      <P>If the two elections  could be combined  with a national referendum, it would be
even better, Lin said. But it remains uncertain whether the next legislative and
presidential elections can be combined.</P>
      <P>The DPP has launched a drive to retrieve the ill-gotten assets of the KMT
through a national referendum and has set July as the deadline for collecting 1
million signatures to put it to a national referendum.</P>
      <P>In addition, the DPP Central Standing Committee approved a petition proposal to
join the United Nations under the name of Taiwan through a referendum, and the
party has set May 20 to complete the first-stage of collecting 100,000
signatures to make the proposal valid.</P>
      <P>President Chen has echoed a call by a nuclear-free promotion group to revise the
referendum law to lower the threshold of signatures needed to put an issue to
national referendum. The Executive Yuan also discussed the issue in a
coordination meeting with the DPP.</P>

      <P>With the handsome profits earned by Taiwan's several unmanned convenience
stores, dubbed "Q-Shops, " many enterprises plan to follow suit, including
several based in Japan, trade sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's first two Q-Shops were set up by the OK convenience chain store last
November under a promotion program for intelligent stores presented by the
Commerce Department under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>Customers can buy groceries, snacks and drinks from vending machines at the
unmanned Q-Shops, using cash or credit cards. Clients can talk to clerks or
security guards via intercom at each vending machine if they have any problems
with the machines.</P>
      <P>According to the statistics, more than 35,000 people made purchases at the two
Q-Shops for total transactions of NT$580,000 (US$17,575) since their opening
Nov. 28 last year. Only 5 percent of the customers used credit cards.</P>
      <P>Yang Hui-wen, a section chief of the Innovative Digitech-Enabled Applications
and Services Institute (IDEAS) under the Institute for Information Industry,
which offers software assistance to the project, noted that with the unmanned
convenience stores reducing significantly their costs in personnel and rent, the
Q-Shops had good profit margins, although the transactions were small.</P>
      <P>In addition to food, beverages and groceries, the OK group will introduce
digital photo printing in order to diversify their operations later this year,
said Chang Hung-hao, general manager of the OK group.</P>
      <P>Other enterprises, including gas stations, highway rest stations, companies in
science parks and some Japanese firms have shown strong interest in following in
the OK group's footsteps.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EPA SAYS IT HAS CLEARED DIOXIN CONTAMINATION SOURCE IN TAINAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 16 (CNA)
04/16/07  20:00:45

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) has prevented
dioxin pollution from a defunct chemical factory in Tainan from affecting human
health since 2003, an EPA official claimed Monday.</P>
      <P>Huang Wan-chu, executive secretary of an EPA committee in charge of a fund for
the remediation of polluted soil, made the remarks in response to a report by
the Chinese-language China Times that residents living near the site of the
closed chemical factory in the southern city have extremely high levels of
dioxin in their blood.</P>
      <P>A study conducted by National Cheng Kung University at the request of the Tainan
city government tested the blood samples of 570 residents living in Tainan's An-
nan district, where the chemical factory operated between 1942 and 1982.</P>
      <P>The results of the study show that 72 percent of them have much higher levels of
dioxin in their blood than the tolerance limit set by the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Dioxins are known carcinogens which can cause birth defects, diabetes, immune
system abnormalities and many other adverse health effects if they accumulate in
the body in large amounts.</P>
      <P>Huang pointed out that the EPA has used more than NT$110 million since 2003 to
remove contamination  sources  and monitor soil conditions and water quality in
fish ponds around the former site of the now defunct Anshun factory of Taiwan
Alkali Industrial Corp.</P>
      <P>He also said that in July 2005, the Ministry of Economic Affairs agreed to set
aside NT$1.3 billion over five years to help the affected residents.</P>
      <P>Huang said the high dioxin levels in the blood of residents near the closed
factory was due to the accumulation of toxins over a long period.</P>
      <P>The factory in question, which was set up by the Japanese in 1942 to produce
hydrochloric acid, caustic soda, and liquid chlorine, became a state-owned
company the year after Japan's surrender in 1945.</P>
      <P>Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC), another state-owned enterprise, bought all the
shares of Taiwan Alkali in 1967. The factory was merged in 1983 with CPC's
subsidiary, China Petrochemical Development Corp., which went private in 1994.</P>
      <P>For decades, residents living around the factory grew farm produce and raised
fish in ponds without any knowledge of the pollution hazard.</P>
      <P>Recently declassified government documents show that the Ministry of Economic
Affairs became aware in 1982 that mercury concentrations in the fish catch from
the area exceeded safe levels for human consumption.</P>
      <P>Many seriously ill residents have been seeking state compensation on grounds
that the factory was owned by the government. They have also complained that the
monthly allowance of some NT$1,800 per person from a state fund is too meager to
pay for their medical bills and other expenses.</P>

      <P>A 130-member group from the offshore Penghu County took a maiden charter flight
Monday to the outlying Kinmen Island, where they boarded a ferry heading for
China's Fujian Province for a four-day visit.</P>
      <P>It was the first Penghu delegation to travel to China via the so-called "mini
three links" -- direct shipping and trade services between Taiwan's Kinmen and
Matsu islands and Fujian ports of Xiamen, Quanzhou and Mawei that lie opposite
on the other side of the Taiwan Strait -- after the central government in Taipei
announced April 1 the inclusion of Penghu in the "mini links" program.</P>
      <P>The group, composed of Penghu county government officials, councilors and
representatives from the local tourism sector, plans to sponsor three rounds of
presentations to sell Penghu to locals in Xiamen, Fuzhou and Quanzhou.</P>
      <P>Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng saw them off from Shuitou Port and hailed
Penghu's inclusion in the "mini links" as mutually beneficial for both Kinmen
and Penghu. Lee said that he plans to organize a seminar with the Matsu and
Penghu authorities to explore the maximum benefit of the "mini links" for the
three outlying islands.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Ping-kun, who led the delegation, voiced his keen desire for
allowing direct weekend cross-strait charter flights from Penghu, making its
Makung airport a key hub like the Taoyuan and Kaohsiung international airports
that already serve direct charter flights to China on special holidays.</P>
      <P>Penghu County Council Speaker Liu Chen Chao-ling called the "mini links via
Kinmen" the fastest route for Penghu residents bound for China.</P>
      <P>She expressed the hope that direct charter flight services between Makung and
Kinmen, which officially kicked off that same day, could be offered on a regular
basis in the short term to help attract Chinese tourists to the island and
improve the local economy.</P>
      <P>Penghu Magistrate Wang Chien-fa also witnessed the ceremony to kick off the
maiden Penghu-Kinmen charter flight, operated by UNI Airways, at Makung airport.</P>
      <P>Wang called for wider opening by the central government for Penghu in cross-

      <P>The right policies, represented by an envoy able to communicate effectively with
the United States, will "be a boost to Taiwan-U.S. relations," a former Taiwan
representative to the United States said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-jen, who served as the nation's top representative to Washington
2000-2004, made the remarks at a public hearing in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is confident that
the new representative to the United States, Joseph Wu, will convey the
government's stance and policies faithfully to the U.S., thus mitigating
bilateral misunderstanding, which he thinks is a good thing.</P>
      <P>He also said that whether the new appointment will provide a boost to
Taiwan-U.S. relations hinges on whether the policy is right.</P>
      <P>The right policy, coupled with an appropriate envoy, will be a boon, but if it
deviates from the right policy, and an envoy cannot faithfully convey the
government's stance and policies, relations will suffer.</P>
      <P>'Deciding whether the policy is right or wrong will require public examination,"
he added.</P>
      <P>Chen's words came as Wu, former chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council,
arrived at the Washington D.C. Monday to assume his new post.</P>
      <P>Wu said that he was glad to be the first DPP member to serve as Taiwan's envoy
in the United States, but he stressed that he will represent the country and not
serve a particular political party, vowing to keep Taiwan's best interests in
mind while dealing with Taiwan-U.S. relations.</P>

Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales offered a measured apology for his mistakes

Wall Street Journal:Questions on Efficacy Cloud a Cancer Vaccine

When Merck &amp; Co. introduced its new vaccine against cervical cancer last
June, it gave it one of the biggest pushes any new medicine has received. The
company lobbied dozens of states to make the vaccine mandatory for 11- and 12
-year-old girls. It aired TV ads featuring young girls skipping rope while
reciting the slogan, "I want to be one less" woman to battle the disease.

The campaign scored some big victories. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention declared all women age 11 to 26 should get the vaccine, called
Gardasil. Texas and Virginia passed mandatory -vaccination laws for girls
entering the sixth grade. Even after Merck halted its lobbying in February amid
criticism, an organization backed by the company continues to push for similar
laws, and about 20 states are considering them. The vaccine costs $360 for a
three-shot regimen.</TEXT>

employees and stock buyers, as well as the public into believing that management
has treated its workers poorly.</P>
      <P>The statement also defended Ho's management, arguing that since Ho took office

      <P>Ma Ying-jeou, former chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , will
attend a second court hearing on corruption charges Tuesday at the Taipei
District Court, Ma's aides said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the aides, Ma's Monday schedule was unaffected by Tuesday's trial,
and he was not so nervous this time compared with April 3 when the trial was
opened for the first time. Tuesday's court hearing will be opened to the public.</P>
      <P>Ma met KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan last week and Lien was relieved to learn
of Ma's current situation concerning the lawsuit against him, the aides said,
adding that in recent days Ma also discussed with lawyers adopting a strategy
with which to better defend himself during the coming trial.</P>
      <P>Ma was charged by Taipei prosecutors in mid-February over his alleged
embezzlement of NT$11 million from a special municipal monthly allowance
designated for his discretionary use during his two terms as mayor of Taipei
from 1998-2006.</P>
      <P>Ma's ongoing trial on embezzlement charges has cast shadow over his chances of
representing the KMT in the 2008 presidential election, as the party's rules
presently ban members convicted in the first trial from taking part in any
elections.</P>
      <P>Despite the embezzlement charges, Ma still picked up earlier this month a
registration form for the KMT's presidential primary in a display of his resolve
to pursue his presidential bid.</P>
      <P>On the other side, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, also a KMT member who
harbors a strong presidential ambition, failed to collect the form, provoking
grave concern among KMT supporters that Wang might split and run in the next
presidential election as an independent instead of pairing up with Ma.</P>
      <P>Due to mounting uncertainties about Ma's fate, KMT members of the Kaohsiung
County branch suggested Monday that the party prepare two presidential tickets
so that it can better cope with the situation in case Ma is unable to take part
in the next presidential race.</P>
      <P>The KMT will have to mediate between the two tickets if Ma is able to ride out
the difficulties lying ahead, they suggested, pointing out that the KMT could
field Wang to run in the coming presidential election if Ma is unable to stand
for the party.</P>
      <P>Wang, who attended an economic seminar with the KMT members in Kaohsiung County
Monday, declined to comment the proposal.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, Taiwan's people are looking forward to a second transfer of
power in 2008, and he urged the KMT to take full precautions against all
possible scenarios in the run-up to the next presidential contest.</P>
      <P>In response to a rumored presidential ticket with Ma, Wang told reporters
earlier the same day in Taipei that such a format "still has a long way to go "
and refused to touch on the issue again in the coming months.</P>

      <P>Two ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential hopefuls Monday
unveiled the results of polls conducted by their two respective camps, with each
claiming greater popularity than the other.</P>
      <P>According to the electoral campaign office of former premier Frank Hsieh, two
public opinion polls excluding opposition pan-blue camp supporters showed that
his popularity exceeding that of Premier Su Tseng-chang, another presidential
hopeful. In a Hsieh-camp-conducted poll, which excluded pan-blue supporters,
Hsieh led by 9 percent, while his edge over Su reached 23 percent in a "pan-
green" supporters-only poll.</P>
      <P>The results of a poll released by Su's campaign office showed that Su's
popularity slightly outstripped Hsieh's by 0.1 percentage point.</P>
      <P>Hsieh and Su find themselves in a toss in terms of poll ratings in the DPP
primary, which also includes Vice President Annette Lu and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-
kun.</P>
      <P>According to the DPP primary system, popularity among general voters will
account for 70 percent of one hopeful's chance in winning party nomination for
the presidential election, while the voting results by party members will
account for the other 30 percent of the candidate's final score.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP TO INITIATE REFERENDUM LAW AMENDMENTS TO LOWER LEGAL THRESHOLDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  17 (CNA)
04/17/07  11:56:34

    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will
initiate draft amendments to the Referendum Law aimed at lowering the legal
thresholds for holding a popular vote on issues of national concern, a party
whip said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming, the DPP legislative caucus convener, made the remarks a day
after the caucus and the Executive Yuan reached a consensus on the steps to
realize the goal of overhauling the Referendum Law.</P>
      <P>According to Ker, the DPP legislative caucus will discuss how the legal
thresholds should be adjusted in the coming few days and come up with a final
package of draft amendments by April 23.</P>
      <P>The package will then be referred to the legislative floor for deliberation and
approval. "Hopefully, the package can be assigned to a relevant standing
committee to screen by April 27," Ker added.</P>
      <P>Noting that the existing legal thresholds for holding a national referendum are
prohibitively high, Ker said critical revisions are needed to make the law
relevant and viable.</P>
      <P>Besides lowering the legal thresholds, Ker said the mandatory referendum review
committee should also be abolished.</P>
      <P>The current law stipulates that the signatures of at least 0.5 percent of
eligible voters in the last presidential election are needed for a referendum
proposal to be initiated. After passing the threshold, the signatures of 5
percent of the eligible voters must be collected within six months for a
referendum to be held. Moreover, half of the total number of eligible voters
must cast ballots for the referendum result to be declared valid.</P>
      <P>An anti-nuclear group known as the Nuke-4 Referendum Initiative Association, led
by former DPP Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung, has proposed that the legal threshold for
making the petition for a referendum valid be lowered to 100 eligible voters and
that the number of signatures needed to be collected to put the proposal to a
referendum be cut to 1.5 percent of eligible voters.</P>
      <P>In response, Ker said the 100 signatures-threshold for proposing a referendum is
too low. "Should that be adopted, I'm afraid there could be an astronomical list
of topics to be put to a popular vote," he cautioned.</P>
      <P>Ker said the DPP legislative caucus will make a thorough review before drawing
up new legal thresholds.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said last week that he has given his full support to
the ongoing campaign relaunched by the Nuke-4 Referendum Initiative Association
to push for an overhaul of the Referendum Law.</P>
      <P>Stressing that referendums are a manifestation of the universal value of
democracy and the fundamental exercise of human rights, Chen said the current
Referendum Law virtually deprives local people of their democratic rights and
should therefore be revised to live up to its promise. He urged the Legislative
Yuan to amend the law and get rid of all unreasonable stipulations by the end of
this year.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan supports the proposal of having the next legislative and

said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after Lin Chia-lung, secretary-general of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , said a day earlier that the Presidential
Office, the Executive Yuan and the DPP share a consensus that the next
presidential and legislative elections as well as referendums on some major
issues of national concern should be held at the same time "to save financial
and social costs."</P>

manages to merge some elections to save costs. "We really have too many
elections," she noted.</P>

months before the term of the present legislature expires Jan. 31, 2008.</P>
      <P>"This means that we can wait until July to work out a schedule for the next
legislative elections, " Chen said, adding that as the term of current CEC
commissioners will expire June 16, it should be the job of the new CEC
commissioners to choose a date for the next legislative elections.</P>
      <P>As for DPP acting Chairman Trong Chai's proposal that referendums on the main
opposition Kuomintang's "ill-gotten" party assets and the issue of whether the
country should apply for U.N. membership under the name of "Taiwan" ought to be
held alongside the next presidential election, Chen said it all depends on
whether enough signatures of eligible voters in support of the proposed
referendums can be collected in time.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, CEC spokesman Teng Tien-you said the Executive Yuan's opinion about
the schedule of the two upcoming elections can be conveyed to the CEC
commissioners for reference.</P>
      <P>While the administration and the DPP authority support the idea of holding  the
next  presidential  and legislative  elections simultaneously, Teng said, the
CEC should also respect the opinions of other sectors of society.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, it will be left for the new Central Election Commission to be formed
in mid-June to decide whether the two elections will be held on the same day,"
Teng explained.</P>
      <P>The president's term will expire May 20,  2008,  and the presidential election
usually takes place in March of the election year.</P>

      <P>Emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the transportation sector fell by 160,000
tons in 2006 in Taiwan compared with the previous year, according to the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) , which Tuesday attributed
the result to a series of transportation related energy-saving measures.</P>
      <P>In keeping with the Kyoto Protocol, an agreement arrived at under the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change as part of the world's efforts to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions that came into force Feb. 16, 2005, the MOTC
began an energy-saving drive targeting vehicles.</P>
      <P>As a result of the drive, 39 action plans were brought forward in 2005 to
address three goals -- developing "green" transportation systems, slowing the
rise in the number and use of motor vehicles, and improving the efficiency of
transportation systems, the MOTC said.</P>
      <P>For example, to encourage public transportation service operators to introduce
low-pollution automobiles, the MOTC provided businesses using environmental-
friendly motor vehicles with extra points in their applications for the right to
offer commercial transportation services on certain roads, such as the Taipei-
Yilan Expressway.</P>
      <P>The MOTC Institute of Transportation has also worked to establish a Web site on
which to publicize  ideas touching  on "green transportation" in the hope that
more and more people will choose to travel via mass transportation systems,
bicycle, or on foot.</P>

      <P>National Chiao-tung University (NCTU) is set to launch an international graduate
program on industrial research and development this autumn to train foreign
talent for local high-technology  companies,  sources at the Hsinchu-based
university said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Graduate students will be granted with full scholarships from sponsor companies
after admission into the program and will be offered posts in sponsors' branch
offices in other countries after graduation, according to Wu Chung-yu, president
of the university.</P>
      <P>Wu said that leading players in the high-tech industry, including Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.,  United Microelectronics Corp., and D-Link
Corp., have already decided to participate in the program.</P>
      <P>The program will begin in September, with an initial enrollment of 50 students,
Wu said, adding that the university expects to train some 400 master's and
doctoral degree holders under the program over the next four years.</P>
      <P>NCTU already provides some 100 courses taught in English, Wu said, adding that
the number is expected to increase over the next several years.</P>
      <P>While explaining the need for such a program, Wu noted that Taiwan's birthrate
has been declining in recent decades, resulting in a growing shortage of high-
tech talent in the country.</P>
      <P>"The talent pool in Taiwan is just too small to meet the needs of high-tech
companies," Wu said, adding that the program is part of the university's
solution to the "talent shortage" problem.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's application for full membership at the World Health Organization (WHO)
should at least be put on the agenda of the World Health Assembly (WHA) in May
for discussion, a non-governmental organization said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Foundation of Medical Professionals Alliance in Taiwan (FMPAT), long
committed to advocating for Taiwan's entry to the WHO, held an international
press conference to voice support for President Chen Shui-bian's recently
announced move to send the application to WHO Director-General Margaret Chan
after ten consecutive years of failure in seeking WHA observer status.</P>
      <P>"For years Taiwan has been pursuing humble goals: becoming a WHA observer, as
supported by the United States and Japan, and making 'meaningful participation',
as suggested by European countries. But both  approaches  have  proven
unsuccessful  due  to  China's politicization of the issue, " said Wu Shuh-min,
President of the FMPAT.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-cheng, Chairman of the Department of Political Science of Soochow
University cited the case of East Germany during the Cold War era and called on
Chan and the WHO secretariat to respect due process.</P>
      <P>Under the then zero-sum relations  between the two German republics, East
Germany's applications to join the WHO were rejected several times in the late
1960s and early 1970s. However, Lo said, what then WHO director-general
Marcolino Gomes Candau did was to refer East Germany's applications to the WHA
for it to make decisions, in the recognition that it was not his proper duty to
determine whether East Germany enjoyed "statehood" as required by WHO
Constitution.</P>
      <P>According to the WHO Constitution, a member state is not necessarily a United
Nations member but can be admitted upon an approval by a simple majority vote of
the WHA.</P>
      <P>Chan in a recent interview with the American television network CNN said the
WHO's "193 member states still hold on very strongly to the One China
principle". Denouncing Chan's claim as false, Lo said that "even if we accepted
the notion of [two sides of the Taiwan Strait as] a divided nation, Chan should
at least follow the East German example in dealing with Taiwan's application."</P>
      <P>Political scientist Wu Chi-chung said there is no so-called "One China"
principle held by the WHO against Taiwan's entry, "and if there were, the
principle would be discriminatory and racist" because Taiwan is not even
accommodated as was East Germany.</P>
      <P>Winston Dang, lawmaker and Director of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
International Affairs Department, said the time is right to seek full WHO
membership because of growing, high rates of support among Taiwan's people and
parliament.</P>
      <P>David Huang, former vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council and a scholar
at Academia Sinica, described Taiwan's exclusion from the WHO as "health
apartheid" and called on the WHO to scrap a secret memorandum it signed with
China in 2005.</P>
      <P>"Even just for the sake of good governance of international organizations, a
secret memorandum is simply illegitimate, " Huang said.</P>
      <P>The memorandum allows China to have a final say on Taiwan's interactions with
the WHO.</P>
      <P>"'Meaningful participation' is meaningless for us because it is another country
that defines the scope and character of such participation," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Meaningful participation has been suggested by some countries to refer to the
opportunity for Taiwan to participate in as many WHO-related meetings as
possible, regardless of official title or circumstance.</P>
      <P>But Taiwan's experts have always been denied or delayed from attending even the
most technical meetings, Huang said.</P>
      <P>George Liu, a Taiwan Solidarity Union legislator, said Taiwan's entry to the WHO
should not be politicized, as "it is a health, moral and human rights issue, "
for diseases know no border and contagious disease outbreaks in Taiwan can
easily spread around the globe.</P>

      <P>Desmond Mpilo Tutu, former Anglican Archbishop of South Africa and Nobel Peace
Prize laureate, will arrive in Taiwan Wednesday for a weeklong visit, Ministry
of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Chien-yeh said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wang said the itinerary of Tutu will be arranged by the Taiwan Foundation for
Democracy (TFD), which invited him for the visit. The TFD is a non-profit
organization dedicated to the promotion of democracy and human rights in Taiwan
and abroad.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, Tutu will meet with the family members of victims of the 228
Incident and pay a visit to Lin Yi-hsiung, former chairman of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident refers to an uprising against the corrupt KMT administration
under the late President Chiang Kai-shek that began Feb. 28, 1947 and was
followed by a bloody crackdown resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of
civilians.</P>
      <P>Lin's mother and twin daughters were murdered on Feb. 28, 1980 when he was in
jail for his involvement in the Kaohsiung Incident in December 1979, a pro-
democracy rally that turned violent. The murder remains unsolved till today.</P>
      <P>On Friday, Tutu will meet with Vice President Annette Lu and later ride the high
speed rail line to Kaohsiung to visit churches in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On April 24, Tutu will deliver a speech on transitional justice and ethnic
reconciliation and share the experience of South Africa in this regard.</P>
      <P>He will also meet with President Chen Shui-bian April 24 before leaving Taiwan
the following day.</P>
      <P>Tutu, 75, is a South African cleric and activist who rose to worldwide fame
during the 1980s as an opponent of apartheid. Tutu served as the chairman of the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) to move the nation along the path of
reconciliation, one year after apartheid was done away with in 1994.</P>
      <P>The TRC was a crucial component of the transition to full and free democracy in
South Africa and, despite some flaws, is generally - though not universally -
regarded as successful.</P>

      <P>A tourism promotional group from Taiwan met Monday with over 100 local
counterparts in New York on the first leg of a U.S. tour that will take it to
Los Angeles and San Francisco in the coming days as the summer travel peak
season approaches.</P>
      <P>The delegation, composed of officials from the Taiwan Visitors Association (TVA)
and representatives from Taiwan-based aviation companies and tour agencies,
sponsored an audiovisual presentation featuring Taiwan's music, dance and
attraction points to New Yorkers as part of its efforts to sell Taiwan to U.S.
tourists.</P>
      <P>As Beijing is to host the 2008 Olympic Games, Taiwan should grab the chance to
promote "theme travel" while the world's attention is focused on the region,
tourism executives opined.</P>
      <P>According to Chang Cheng-yuan, director of the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry
of Transportation and Communications (MOTC), North American tourists have in
recent years become more aware of Taiwan, and Asia has increasingly turned into
a major out-bound travel destination among U. S. visitors.</P>
      <P>Thanks to Taiwan's position as a prime transfer hub in Asia, the country is
strongly placed to court more tourists from the United States, Chang said.</P>
      <P>In the first three months of this year, more than 97,000 business travelers and
tourists from North America visited Taiwan, up by 3 percent over the previous
year's level, MOTC statistics showed.</P>
      <P>TVA Secretary-General Ju Hung-hai voiced his belief that Taipei 101 and the
National  Palace Museum in Taipei are definitely world-class tourist
attractions. A tour package that connects these tourist points in Taipei with
interesting spots in central and southern Taiwan would make an intriguing trip
for tourists, he said.</P>
      <P>Lee Yung-chun, manager of the Taipei-based China Airlines' New York office,
echoed Chang's view favoring spreading theme travel in Taiwan. Taiwan's
delicious food, spas, and natural scenery are features that should be better
packaged to court more foreign visitors, he said.</P>
      <P>An executive of the New York chapter of the Pacific Asia Travel Association
suggested Taiwan "take the initiative" in finding new ways to lure foreign
tourists, besides relying on its natural landscapes.</P>
      <P>For instance, he said, Taiwan should be keen to popularize sporting activities,
such as rock climbing, water-borne motor racing, and seasonal festivals taking
advantage of its beautiful mountains and beaches.</P>
      <P>Although the travel industry executive acknowledged that Taiwan faces
difficulties in highlighting its attractions due to the proximity  to China,
Japan and other popular southeast Asian destinations, he contended that Taiwan
must show that it possess something unique or interesting that tourists will
consider worth exploring.</P>

      <P>Pineapple growers in Taiwan have received a sweet surprise this year as an
effect of global warming -- they have found the tropical fruit has not only
grown fast and ripened early, but is also particularly sweet.</P>
      <P>Agricultural experts at the Tainan District Agricultural Research and Extension
Station noted Tuesday that pineapples, which usually are in season in Taiwan
from May to July, have been in abundant supply this year since March.</P>
      <P>They pointed out that Taiwan's total pineapple crops have exceeded 12,000
hectares, with most of the pineapple farms located in the four southern Taiwan
counties of Pingtung, Kaohsiung, Tainan and Chiayi.</P>
      <P>According to the experts, between 70 percent and 80 percent of Taiwan's
pineapple acreage is devoted to the most-favored Tainung No. 17 pineapple, also
known as the golden diamond pineapple.</P>
      <P>This variety, they added, has a thin rind and a tender, golden-yellow flesh that
is juicy, rich and sweet, with a sugar content of over 14 percent.</P>
      <P>There has been a change in consumers' behavior patterns, the experts continued,
adding that while most pineapples were bought by factories and canned in the
past, nowadays most consumers prefer to eat the fruit fresh.</P>
      <P>Pineapples are low in saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium but rich in fructose
and are a good source of dietary fiber, thiamin, Vitamin  B6, Vitamin C,
calcium, iron, copper, manganese  and potassium.</P>
      <P>The fruit also has an anti-inflammatory effect and is said to be exceptionally

      <P>Taiwanese trade officials warned Tuesday that the country should accelerate the
upgrading of its industries amid fierce competition in the world community.</P>
      <P>Officials of the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) made the
appeal after the latest trade report released by World Trade Organization (WTO)
showed that Taiwan was the 17th largest trading country in 2006, down a notch
from its 2005 rating, and the worst rating in memory.</P>
      <P>According to the WTO statistics, Taiwan's trade value totalled US$427 billion
last year, accounting for 1.7 percent of the world's total trade, representing a
drop of 0.1 percentage point from its share in 2005.</P>
      <P>The United States continued to be the world's largest trading country in 2006,
followed by Germany, China, Japan, United Kingdom, and France, in that order,
according to WTO statistics.</P>
      <P>However, CEPD officials revealed that the value of China's exports in the second
half of 2006 exceeded for the first time that of U.S., coming second only to
that of Germany.</P>
      <P>Officials attributed the drop of Taiwan's trade rating to the rise of many
developing countries with great potential and the positive trade performances of
advanced countries.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan's trade volume lagged behind that of the other three Asian
tigers -- Singapore, South Korea, and Hong Kong, the officials went on.</P>
      <P>Noting that this should be taken as a serious warning and must not be ignored,
the officials urged the government to effectively implement those policies
already presented which aim at elevating the competitiveness of the island's
industries.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) warned the public Tuesday that epidemic
cerebrospinal meningitis has entered peak season with 17 notified cases so far,
among which 11 have developed the full-blown disease and two have died.</P>
      <P>Lin Ting, deputy director of the DOH Center for Disease Control, said the early
symptoms of this form of meningitis, which is caused by a specific bacterium,
could be missed, saying that the public should pay attention to such symptoms as
fever and skin rashes.</P>
      <P>Treatment with antibiotics and other drugs is usually effective against this
infection in the initial stage, he added.</P>
      <P>Lin said the disease is most prevalent between March and April, noting that
there were only four reported cases in the same period of last year with only
one confirmed case. There were 25 reported cases in the whole of 2006, among
which there were 13 confirmed cases and two deaths.</P>
      <P>Lin said that among the 11 confirmed cases this year, three cases are babies not
yet a month old, with the remaining eight cases aged between 11 and 86. They are
sporadic cases rather than cluster cases, Lin added.</P>
      <P>He advised the public to stay away from crowded places such as military barracks
or school dormitories and to pay attention to personal hygiene.</P>
      <P>People should also get vaccinated if they travel to Africa or other regions
listed as infectious places, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou appeared at the Taipei District Court Tuesday
for a second court session in his trial on charges of embezzlement.</P>
      <P>In response to media inquiries on the session, Ma said he and his lawyers
questioned the admissibility of evidence that anti-corruption prosecutor Hou
Kuan-jen had submitted to support his indictment of Ma Feb. 13 on charges of
embezzling from a special allowance fund designated for his discretionary use
while he served as Taipei mayor from 1998 to 2006.</P>
      <P>Ma told reporters that he had never noticed that he was listed as a "defendant"
before appearing at a probe on the mayoral allowance Nov. 14 at the Taiwan High
Prosecutors Office's anti-corruption center until the inquiry took place. On the
notice for him to answer the questioning, Ma said he was classified as a "person
of interest."</P>
      <P>Therefore, he did not arrive with his own lawyer to defend his rights and
interests during questioning, Ma claimed.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he had been "misled" to face an "ambush-like probe" without the
protection of lawyers, Ma declined to comment, only asking that people following
case look into reports of the probe before coming to a decision.</P>
      <P>Asserting his innocence,  Ma claimed he has never stopped demanding of himself
that he stay clean and follow the law since he began his political career two
decades ago. His reputation was smeared after the prosecution ignored the
evidence in his favor during the probe, said the politician, who has portrayed
himself as a political "Mr. Clean."</P>
      <P>Soon after being indicted on charges of corruption, Ma resigned from the post of
chairman of the opposition Kuomintang and announced his bid to run for the
presidency in 2008. He argued if he is found guilty, the same fate will befall
almost all government executives and everyone who has ever served as a mayor or
county magistrate.</P>
      <P>Ma was charged with embezzling NT$11.17 million (US$337,650) from the mayoral
special allowance funds by taking advantage of his position. Hou, who brought
the high-profile indictment against Ma, rejected an interpretation by the
Ministry of Justice last November that special allowance funds for executives of
government departments are actually meant as salary subsidies.</P>
      <P>At the court, Ma urged the judges to review the long-existing but faulty special
allowance fund system and his decision to trust the collective wisdom of "common
practices" concerning the use of the funds.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MA-WANG TICKET UP TO PUBLIC MANDATE: LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung, April 17 (CNA)

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng of the Kuomintang (KMT) said Tuesday that
it seems the party is set to nominate former Chairman Ma Ying-jeou as its
candidate for the 2008 presidential race, but whether he will serve as Ma's
running mate should be determined by the public in the coming months.</P>
      <P>Wang made the comments while answering questions from students after delivering
a keynote speech at National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences in
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, it is almost certain that Ma will be the candidate fielded by
the KMT in the next presidential election. Given current conditions, a Ma-Wang
ticket is much more feasible than a Wang-Ma ticket, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>That meant, the eventual formation of a Ma-Wang ticket must be determined by
receiving some sort of a public mandate in the months ahead, after taking into
account party unity and their chances of victory given the treacherous political
situation in Taiwan, Wang stated.</P>
      <P>Commenting on his earlier proposal that the KMT nominate another candidate to
run in the next presidential election if Ma is convicted in the first trial on
corruption charges, Wang said that the suggestion does not represent his current
personal position and noted that a Wang-Ma ticket is almost certainly out of the
question.</P>
      <P>Ma and Wang agreed tentatively in March to invite each other to team up on the
KMT ticket in the next presidential election no matter who won the party's
nomination out of concern that a split would ruin the party's chances of
victory.</P>
      <P>But Ma has been dogged by an ongoing lawsuit over his alleged embezzlement of
NT$11 million in funds from a special municipal monthly allowance earmarked for
his discretionary use when he served as mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006.</P>
      <P>Ma stepped down from the main opposition KMT chairmanship after being indicted
in mid-February by Taipei prosecutors on embezzlement charges but immediately
announced his bid to pursue presidency following the charges.</P>
      <P>Despite  corruption  charges against him,  Ma picked up a registration form
early this month for the KMT's presidential primary, highlighting his resolve to
pursue his presidential desire.</P>
      <P>However Wang did not pick up the registration form, a development which has
stirred up concern that he might run as an independent instead of being Ma's
running mate.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court opened hearings on Ma's case April 3 and a second
session was held Tuesday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WHO APPLICATION FOR 'TAIWAN' NOT CONTRARY TO 'FOUR NOES' PROMISE</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian stressed Tuesday that the government's  application  to
join the World  Health Organization (WHO) as a full member under the name of
"Taiwan" is not contrary to his previous "four noes" promise.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during a meeting at the Presidential Office with Henry
Hyde, ex-chairman of the International Relations Committee of U.S. House of
Representatives.</P>
      <P>Chen's "four noes" promise, made at his 2000 inauguration, means not declaring
Taiwan independence, not changing the ROC's official name,  not  pushing  forth
the  inclusion  of the  so-called "state-to-state" description in the
Constitution, and not promoting a referendum to change the status quo in regards
to the question of independence or unification.</P>
      <P>Chen said he wrote a letter to Margaret Chan, director general of the World
Health Organization (WHO) April 11, applying to join the WHO as a full member
under the title of "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has encountered great difficulty joining international
organizations under its official title "ROC," Chen said the name of "Taiwan" is
the term most used on international occasions and supported by the majority of
Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has sought to join the World Health Assembly, the policy-making body of
the WHO, as an observer for the last decade, but has failed to gain entrance due
to the opposition of China.</P>
      <P>According  to Chen,  China signed a secret memorandum  of understanding (MOU)
with the WHO Secretariat in 2005, imposing more limits on Taiwan's entry into
the world organization.</P>
      <P>Chen said the government's application to join the WHO as a full member under
the name of "Taiwan" has been endorsed by more than half of the country's
legislators, and according to a survey conducted in March, 94.9 percent of the
respondents supported the country's decision to apply to join the WHO under the
name "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The president stressed that the health concerns of 23 million people in Taiwan
should not be deprived, and disease control efforts should find no loophole in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan suffered significantly during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
(SARS) outbreak in 2003, and therefore should not be excluded from the world
disease prevention system, Chen added.</P>

      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Tuesday that the Executive Yuan is aware of the
problem of low starting salaries for university graduates with master's or
bachelor's degrees and is taking measures to address the issue.</P>
      <P>The premier said that his "Mega Warmth, Mega Investment" project unveiled
recently, specifically targets training programs for college students in hopes

      <P>The premier made the remarks during a question-and-answer session in the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Opposition Legislator Chao Liang-yen of the People First Party noted that
starting salaries for graduates with master's or doctoral degrees averaged
NT$31,567 (US$957) per month, and NT$26,700 for those with bachelor's degrees,
figures that are even lower than the averages of 10 years ago according to a
survey of 2006 graduates conducted by the Council of Labor Affairs.</P>
      <P>Chao asked if this has to do with the rapid expansion of universities, resulting
in an oversupply of university graduates given current demands.</P>
      <P>The premier said that his Cabinet is aware of the problem, saying that since the
rapid expansion of universities and graduate schools, the supply and demand did
seem to be out of balance.</P>
      <P>In addition, students having completed school programs are yet to meet the
demands of businesses, resulting in low pay for the newcomers to the job market.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Directorate General of the Budget, Accounting and Statistics
reported that the number of graduates with master's or doctoral degrees was more
than 48,000 in 2006, or three times that of a decade ago, and their average
starting salary was only NT$5,000 more than the average starting salary for

which was also attended by several DPP lawmakers and former government

      <P>According to Hsieh, victory in the 2008 presidential election is the ultimate

May 6 along with a vote for legislative candidates, the outcomes of which will

Thirty-two people were killed, along with a gunman, and at least 15 injured in

The police and witnesses said some victims were executed with handguns while
other students were hurt jumping from upper-story windows of the classroom

killings, the gunman killed himself, the police said.

      <P>The first-quarter operations of the Offshore Shipping Center (OSC)  in Kaohsiung
Harbor decreased year-on-year, an official of the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The OSC's total operations reached its peak of 674,000 TEUs in 2004, decreased
to 661,000 TEUs in 2005 and to 616,000 TEUs in 2006. The 151,000 TEUs from
January-March 2007 represented a 5.29 percent drop from the same period of last
year and future growth is not likely, the official said.</P>
      <P>The official said the OSC, established in 1997, allows carriers to handle direct
shipping between Taiwan's Kaohsiung and China's Xiamen and Fuzhou ports, but
only with cargo heading for third destinations.</P>
      <P>With other ports in China gradually improving facilities for big vessels,
allowing them to ship directly to America and Europe, the importance of OSC has

      <P>The U.S.-based Carlyle Group has abandoned a plan to acquire Kaohsiung-based
Advanced Semiconductor Engineering Inc (ASE) because of the difficulty in
arriving at a price with ASE for its stocks, an ASE official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The anonymous ASE official said that after five months of negotiations, the
final price offered by Carlyle-- NT$39.5 per share--- was not accepted by ASE
whose stock closed at NT$41 per share at Taiwan Stock Exchange Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Carlyle initially offered to acquire all of ASE's 4.6 billion outstanding common
shares at NT$39 per share in November. That means it would have purchased the
world's No.1 chip packaging and test company for NT$18 billion, which would have
been the largest-ever buyout in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-U.S. FTA WOULD BE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL: CLA CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 18 (CNA)
04/18/07  19:26:59
(By Jorge Liu and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top labor affairs official said Tuesday that the signing of a free
trade agreement (FTA) between Taiwan and the United States would be mutually
beneficial for the United States, China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Chairman Lee Ying-yuan made the remarks as he
wound up a visit to the United States in which he pushed for the signing of an
FTA between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Lee, who arrived in Washington Sunday, said it is still difficult for the United
States to sign an FTA with Taiwan, but added that the situation is "not
completely hopeless."</P>
      <P>According to Lee, if both sides were to sign an FTA, it would be beneficial for
the United States, China and Taiwan and that China should have no reason to
oppose it.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan is a major investor in China and that each year a great
number of Taiwan tourists visit China, spending tens of billions of dollars
there. China would indirectly benefit from a Taiwan-U.S. FTA, he said.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that the present political atmosphere in the United States is more
conservative and that the Democrat-controlled U.S. Congress is more reserved
about signing FTAs with other countries. But he added that there are still a lot
of U.S. congressmen who sympathize with and support Taiwan.</P>
      <P>With the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA)-- a fast-track arrangement that allows
the Bush administration to negotiate trade deals and present them to Congress
for a simple yes-or-no vote -- approaching its expiration date at the end of
June, it is believed that it will be even more difficult for the United States
to sign FTAs with other countries after that.</P>
      <P>But Lee said he learned from think tanks that Nancy Pelopsi, speaker of the U.S.
House, might leave room for compromises on bills that are not related to
ideological issues. The possibility that the TPA will be extended cannot be
ruled out, he added.</P>
      <P>Lee delivered speeches to think tanks and lobbied congressional support for the
signing of an FTA during his visit, which will wrap up April 19.</P>

      <P>The Sinjan Auto Auction (SAA), an affiliate of the Yulon Group, has launched
Point of Sale (POS) electronic auction system under a collaboration with Acer
Computer aimed at the local and international market for used cars, SAA Chairman
Su Ching-yang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Acer and SAA, the nation's largest used car auctioneer, intend to introduce the
system to China, Japan and Thailand, according to Su.</P>
      <P>Instead of using a Japanese system, SAA worked with Acer in order to acquire its
own technology platform, Su said, adding that the newly launched system will
help expand the auction scale for used cars in Taiwan and help it enter the
international market, especially China.</P>
      <P>China has unlimited market development for second-hand vehicles, with used car
sales there increasing for three consecutive years and only a 26.4 percent
growth rate in new car sales in 2006, Su quoted statistics of the China
Automobile Dealers Association as saying.</P>
      <P>Su vowed to make SAA a leading brand in the second-hand car business in Chinese
speaking areas and added that the POS system will be introduced to China as long
as related regulations can be approved.</P>

      <P>A 19-km rapid transit rail line linking Pingtung County with the greater
Kaohsiung area will be entirely elevated so that there will not be any level
crossings causing traffic congestion, Pingtung County Magistrate Tsao Chi-hung
announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tsao told a press conference that the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) has agreed to the county government's request to
change the CEPD's original plan by elevating the entire rapid transit line and
increasing the budget from NT$5.96 billion to NT$15.25 billion (US$459 million).</P>
      <P>The revised plan will not only make 24 level crossings in Pingtung County
redundant, but also allow a new highway to be constructed under the rapid
transit line, according to Tsao.</P>
      <P>He said the project is scheduled for completion in June 2011, and that
eventually this rapid transit line will be served by 220 trains a day, linking
Pingtung County with the greater Kaohsiung area's rapid transit system and the
Taiwan High Speed Rail's terminal at Zuoying.</P>
      <P>Many real estate brokers sent representatives to the press conference to learn

      <P>The Taipei Customs Office (TPCO) established  a kennel for drug detection dogs
to improve its effectiveness in combating drug smuggling, Director of the
Directorate General of Customs Chien Liang-chi said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chien said a total of five dogs will patrol together with two handlers, joining
in drug detection duties at the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport in July
when the three dogs already on site will be joined by two others.</P>
      <P>The TPCO discovered 36 kilograms of high quality heroin in the first quarter of
2007,  with most of the busts credited  to intelligence work and another 25
percent discovered through the use of X-ray machines, Chien said.</P>
      <P>The assistance of drug detection dogs will help eliminate blind spots not
covered by physical searches or mechanical discovery, and thereby improve
detection of contraband drugs including heroin, cocaine, and marijuana, Chien
added.</P>
      <P>Chien said it is common to utilize dogs' sensitive sense of smell to curb drug

    <HEADLINE>LAW AMENDMENT PROPOSAL AIMS TO CLEAN-UP POLITICS: DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  18 (CNA)
04/18/07  21:44:05

    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) urged
Wednesday the public not to politicize a DPP-initiated draft amendment to
prevent suspected criminals from taking part in presidential elections, saying
that it will help to clean-up politics in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative caucus whip Wang Hsing-nan made the comments in a Legislative
Yuan news conference after a proposed revision to the Presidential and Vice
Presidential Election and Recall Law, submitted by DPP lawmaker Chen Chin-der,
was included a day earlier on the agenda of the Procedure Committee.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers of the opposition People First Party (PFP) and the Non-Partisan
Solidarity Union all were absent from the Tuesday meeting, making it possible to
railroad the proposed revision through the committee.</P>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers have vowed to block the proposed
amendment -- widely believed to target former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, who is
pursuing a presidential bid despite being charged with corruption -- in the
upcoming Friday meeting.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, DPP lawmakers will be fully mobilized to secure the passage
of the draft bill in the Friday meeting, but they will respect whatever decision
PFP lawmakers make regarding this matter. The PFP and the KMT set up a new and
closer partnership in January, and the two parties have long cooperated in the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chen called for widespread support from legislative peers for the passage of the
proposed amendment, and argued that the KMT has been "hijacked" by Ma as the
party currently is seeking to modify its internal regulations banning party
members convicted in the first trial from taking part in any elections to keep
alive Ma's hopes of running in the next presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chen also denied widespread criticism that his proposed amendment to ban
candidates convicted in the first trial in presidential elections is intended to
target any particular individual.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, it is widely assumed that PFP lawmakers were absent from the Tuesday
Procedure Committee meeting due to disputes arising from the May 12 by-election
for the Keelung mayorship and December's legislative election despite the fact
that the two parties set up a KMT-PFP alliance in January to step up
collaboration in the upcoming elections.</P>
      <P>Later the same day, KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung promised that he will do his best
to "mediate" with the PFP to ensure that PFP legislators are aligned with their
KMT counterparts and prepared to reject the draft law amendment Friday in the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Wu questioned whether such "a clause targeting Ma" really serves social justice,
and called it a DPP "plot" to squeeze Ma out of the next presidential contest.</P>
      <P>In response to speculation that the KMT is planning to relax its regulations
excluding convicted party members from taking part in any elections, Wu said
that such a change must be approved by party delegates in a national congress,
but made it clear that "even if the KMT implements the rule change, it will be
for the good of the entire party, and not only for Ma."</P>
      <P>According to KMT Secretary-General Wu Duen-yih, the KMT party central will not
push through a change in the party charter as any revision must be decided by a
two-third majority of party delegates in a national congress.</P>
      <P>The KMT is slated to hold its 17th plenary session June 24, a KMT spokesman
said.</P>

      <P>A novel fire-resistant insulation material,  developed by Taiwan's Industrial
Technology Research Institute (ITRI) , has made its debut at the ongoing Hanover
Messe trade fair,  the institute's Europe branch in Berlin reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The new material, named Reddex,  has strong fire-resistant ability, ITRI
officials stationed in Berlin said, adding that even at temperatures of 1,000
degrees Celsius, it can still maintain a back-side temperature of about 300
degrees C for over 60 minutes, without either drip-melt or break-up.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, they noted, eco-friendly Reddex contains neither halogens  nor
phosphorous,  both of which are widely used in traditional insulation materials,
therefore it produces no toxic particles when exposed to flames. Steam is the
only by-product, they added.</P>
      <P>In addition, the ITRI officials said, the smoke density released by Reddex is
only 2.0, only one 1 percent of a safe ceiling of 200.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, Reddex has been successfully applied to awide range
of products, including paint, coating, paste, film, hoses, coated fabric and
other protective insulation used in vehicles and buildings.</P>
      <P>The Hanover Messe, started in 1947, has become the largest industrial fair in
the world. It is held annually at the Hanover fairground, with the participation
of about 6,000 exhibitors and 200,000 visitors per year.</P>

      <P>A junior high school in Yilan County dismissed as "sheer speculation" Wednesday
a media report claiming that electromagnetic waves from a high-voltage power
transmission facility in the school's vicinity might be related to the
relatively high susceptibility of cancer among its students.</P>
      <P>According to the report carried in the Taipei-based China Times daily Tuesday,
the Nanao Junior High School has only 200-plus student, but four of its students
have been diagnosed with cancer over the past four years, prompting school
authorities to wonder whether electromagnetic waves from the nearby high-voltage
power transmission facility should be blamed for the phenomenon.</P>
      <P>In response, Nanao school principal Wu Ling-mei said the report was full of
mistakes.</P>
      <P>Wu said that a Nanao student indeed died of cancer eight years ago, not four
years ago as reported. As for the remaining three ailing students, Wu said, they
were all diagnosed with cancer during their elementary schools and one of them
was relocated to Yilan from Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>It requires verification by professional medical experts and scholars to
determine whether their illnesses have anything to do with the power
transmission facility, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Wu said, the school has never taken the initiative to collect
information about its students' illness for supply to the media nor has it
bother to speculate on the possible cause of their diseases.</P>
      <P>To the best of her knowledge, Wu said, the China Times reporter had never
visited the school before writing the article. Wu said the school has asked the
newspaper to correct its misleading report.</P>

The police identified Cho Seung-Hui, a 23- year-old student, as the killer of 32
people in the shooting rampage at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, releasing
new information on Tuesday about the troubled mind of a young man few people on
campus knew.

Federal investigators said Mr. Cho X a South Korean immigrant who Americanized
his name and preferred to be known as Seung Cho X left behind a note that they
described as a lengthy, rambling and bitter list of complaints focusing on moral
laxity and double-dealing he found among what he viewed as wealthier and more
privileged students on campus.

Wall Street Journal:Why Chicago Fans Trash Blackhawks

Sitting in $80 seats just behind the net at a recent Chicago Blackhawks hockey
game, Anthony Molinaro and his girlfriend could see the sweat roll down the
goalie's face and hear the grunts of the skaters as they battled for the puck
along the boards.

The seats were freebies, courtesy of owner Bill Wirtz, as part of a "fan
appreciation" program. So was Mr. Molinaro, a 39-year-old community-college
employee and lifelong fan, grateful? Not quite.</TEXT>

      <P>The heads of three local governments agreed Wednesday to form a task force to
study the feasibility of building a light rail rapid transit system for the
region covering the city of Hsinchu and the counties of Hsinchu and Miaoli.</P>
      <P>Hsinchu Mayor Lin Junq-tzer, Hsinchu County Magistrate Cheng Yung-chin and
Miaoli County Magistrate Liu Cheng-Hung held a meeting on the matter, which was
also attended by Huang Der-ray, director of the Hsinchu Science Park
Administration.</P>
      <P>They  reached  consensus  at the meeting  that  the three administrative areas
naturally form a large community and should have a rapid transit system to serve
the region and make the life of its residents more convenient.</P>
      <P>They decided to set up a NT$6 million fund to allow the task force to conduct a
feasibility study on the proposed project, with the four parties each providing
NT$1 million and the shortfall of NT$2 million to be filled through a request
for aid to the central government.</P>
      <P>The three local government heads agreed that regional planning and strategic
alliances are trends that will shape the future of Taiwan's administrative
areas, and that for the sake of the common interests of the city of Hsinchu and
the counties of Hsinchu and Miaoli, it is necessary to assess the feasibility of
the light rail transit system as soon as possible.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former South African Archbishop Desmond Mpilo Tutu arrived in Taiwan Wednesday
for a week-long visit at the invitation of the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy.</P>
      <P>Tutu, who rose to worldwide fame during the 1980s as an opponent of apartheid
and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984, said he will take in the latest
developments in Taiwan and exchange views with local friends on a range of
topics of mutual interest, including political and economic affairs and ethnic
harmony.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, Tutu will visit Machangting, a former execution ground for
political prisoners adjacent to the present-day Youth Park in western Taipei,
and 228 Peace Memorial Park in downtown Taipei where he will meet with family
members of the victims of the infamous 228 Incident, an uprising in Taiwan that
began Feb. 28, 1947 and was suppressed by the then-Kuomintang government,
resulting in the killing of thousands of civilians.</P>
      <P>Tutu is set to meet Friday with Vice President Annette Lu, who was imprisoned
for nearly six years for her pro-democracy activities during Taiwan's martial
law era. Later that day, he will travel to the southern port city of Kaohsiung
via the high-speed rail line.</P>
      <P>Tutu will deliver a speech April 24 on South Africa's experiences in seeking
transitional justice and ethnic reconciliation following the end of apartheid.
As head of South Africa's  Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Tutu has played
a leading role in his country's post-apartheid campaign to heal historical
wounds and boost ethnic harmony.</P>

      <P>A novel fire-resistant insulation material,  developed by Taiwan's Industrial
Technology Research Institute (ITRI) , has made its debut at the ongoing Hanover
Messe trade fair,  the institute's Europe branch in Berlin reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The new material, named Reddex,  has strong fire-resistant ability, ITRI
officials stationed in Berlin said, adding that even at temperatures of 1,000
degrees Celsius, it can still maintain a back-side temperature of about 300
degrees C for over 60 minutes, without either drip-melt or break-up.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, they noted, eco-friendly Reddex contains neither halogens  nor
phosphorous,  both of which are widely used in traditional insulation materials,
therefore it produces no toxic particles when exposed to flames. Steam is the
only by-product, they added.</P>
      <P>In addition, the ITRI officials said, the smoke density released by Reddex is
only 2.0, only one 1 percent of a safe ceiling of 200.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, Reddex has been successfully applied to awide range
of products, including paint, coating, paste, film, hoses, coated fabric and
other protective insulation used in vehicles and buildings.</P>
      <P>The Hanover Messe, started in 1947, has become the largest industrial fair in
the world. It is held annually at the Hanover fairground, with the participation
of about 6,000 exhibitors and 200,000 visitors per year.</P>

      <P>A tornado hit Tainan County in the early morning hours of Wednesday, with the
wind speeds estimated at up to 102 kilometers per hour, tearing down at least 10
homes and leaving livestock dead, according to the Central Weather Bureau (CWB).</P>
      <P>The tornado occurred at around 1: 40 a.m. and lasted until 2: 09 a.m., bringing
strong winds estimated at level 10 on the Beaufort Scale and heavy rains to the
southern county, CWB officials said, adding that rain accumulation during the
duration of tornado amounted to 30-35 millimeters.</P>
      <P>The officials said as tornadoes are so unpredictable, the CWB judged that from
the movement of the system on radar screens and from information provided by the
general public that the system must be a tornado.</P>
      <P>The real cause of the tornado is still unclear, the officials said, adding that
tornadoes usually occur when super cold front systems are accompanied by thunder
and strong winds. The officials further said that while tornadoes are not
unusual in Taiwan in the spring and summer, they rarely cause serious damage.</P>
      <P>As tornados always carry strong winds which could easily destroy measurement
facilities, it is hard to get reliable measurements of them, the officials said,
adding that the CWB does not have an observation booth in the area, so it was
impossible to measure the actual level of Wednesday's tornado.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the CWB said that a cold front is expected to arrive in the country
on Sunday and that rain is also forecast for the northern, central, and southern
parts of the island.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's representative office in the United States said Wednesday it will send

condolences after Monday's shooting rampage which claimed 33 lives, including
the gunman's.</P>
      <P>The officials from the Republic of China representative office in Washington,
D.C. will also meet with Taiwanese students and faculty members at the Virginia
Tech campus in Blacksburg, Virginia where the deadliest campus massacre in U.S.
history took place, an office spokesman said, adding that if necessary, the
officials will offer assistance to them.</P>
      <P>The representative office already sent condolence messages to Virginia Tech
management by phone on behalf of the ROC government and people shortly after the
tragedy, the spokesman said, adding that the office also immediately contacted
the school's international student affairs division and the Taiwanese Students
Association to get confirmation that all Taiwanese students and professors were

      <P>Joining the World Health Organization (WHO) under the name "Taiwan" is the will
of the people of Taiwan, with 95 percent of the population supporting the idea,
Minister of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) James Huang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks while attending a book presentation by the Taiwan
International Health Action, a government-funded organization set up to provide
medical assistance to Taiwan's diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>No matter how difficult the bid for WHO membership might be, Huang vowed to make
every effort to let other countries know through Taiwan's diplomatic allies and
other channels that it is wrong to shut Taiwan out of the health organization.</P>
      <P>He noted that the government has for the past decade humbly bid to join the WHO
as an observer, which the United States and Japan has supported, and to
"participate in a meaningful way" in the WHO's activities, as suggested by
European countries, but both approaches have proven unsuccessful due to China's
obstruction.</P>
      <P>Since China signed a memorandum with the WHO in 2005, which allows China to have
the final say on Taiwan's interactions with the organization, the situation has
become even worse, Huang noted.</P>
      <P>Meaningful participation has been suggested by some countries as meaning the
opportunity for Taiwan to participate in as many WHO-related meetings as
possible, regardless of its official title or the circumstances, he said.</P>
      <P>However, he continued, permission for experts from Taiwan to attend even
meetings on technical issues has consistently been denied or delayed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has become even more marginalized, and this is why it has decided to push
for membership under the name "Taiwan," Huang said.</P>
      <P>WHO Director-General Margaret Chan, in a recent interview with CNN, said the
WHO's "193 member states still hold on very strongly to the one China
principle".</P>

    <HEADLINE>MINIMUM WAGE TO BE RAISED IN SECOND HALF OF YEAR: CLA CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, April 18 (CNA)
04/19/07  16:12:51

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's minimum wage will be adjusted in the second half of this year, probably
July 1, to make it more commensurate with Taiwan's general economic situation
and consumer price index, a visiting labor official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Council of Labor Affairs Chairman Lee Ying-yuan, who is visiting Washington,
D.C. to lobby for support for Taiwan's drive to sign a free trade agreement with
the United States, made the remarks while meeting with Taiwanese journalists
stationed in the U.S. capital over a cup of tea.</P>
      <P>After  extensive  consultations  with major industrial  and commercial
associations, labor unions, and academic groups, Lee said a consensus has been
forged for a measured adjustment of the country's minimum wage, which has been
frozen at NT$15,840 (US$480) per month, or NT$66 per hour for a decade.</P>
      <P>In view of the more than 50 percent growth in Taiwan's gross domestic product
(GDP) for the past 10 years, Lee said, the minimum wage should be raised
appropriately to let all wage earners enjoy the fruits of economic growth.</P>
      <P>The planned adjustment is tentatively set for implementation in the second half
of this year, Lee said, adding that July 1 is the most favored starting day. But
he added that the exact timing for the implementation  can  be  readily  changed
based  on practical considerations.</P>
      <P>As to the adjustment range, Lee said, a combination of factors, including the
increase in the average consumer price index over the past decade, Taiwan's
general economic growth as well as the possible adverse impact on local
industries' competitiveness, should be taken into consideration when deciding on
the level of the minimum wage increase.</P>
      <P>While the business community has declared that 5 percent is the maximum level
they are willing to accept for an upward adjustment, labor groups want a far
larger hike, Lee said, adding that he once proposed at a Legislative Yuan
session that the minimum wage be raised to 40 percent of the average salary of
all workers in the country. If adopted, the minimum wage would be increased to
NT$17,600 per month, representing a hike of 11 percent over the current level.</P>
      <P>"Anyway, many elements should be taken into account, and the final adjustment
figure should be announced by the premier himself, " Lee said.</P>
      <P>Noting that under Taiwan's new portable pension system adopted some two years
ago, employers are required to deposit a monthly pension reserve fund equivalent
to 6 percent of an employee's salary, Lee said, the measure is to some extent
tantamount to offering a pay raise. "This element should also be taken into
consideration when deciding the minimum wage adjustment range," he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee said Taiwan could refer to the past U.S. practice in basic wage
adjustment in which its minimum wage was raised by 7.25 percent in three stages
during a 26-month interval.</P>
      <P>Lee arrived in the U.S. capital Sunday for an FTA-lobbying visit, during  which
he has met with Bush administration  officials, congressional leaders and think
tank scholars to brief them on Taiwan's labor policies and welfare services as
part of his efforts to clear the way for signing a bilateral free trade pact. He
will wrap up his visit Thursday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PIGS KILLED CRUELLY AT OVER 70% OF TAIWAN SLAUGHTERHOUSES: REPORT</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A report released Thursday by an animal rights organization claims that more
than 70 percent of public slaughterhouses in Taiwan still kill pigs in a cruel
manner.</P>
      <P>Chu Tzeng-hung, chairman of the Environment and Animal Society of Taiwan (EAST)
, released the findings of the organization's study of slaughterhouses around
the country conducted over a three-year period dating back to 2004.</P>
      <P>After watching a video made by the EAST about how Taiwan's slaughterhouses kill
their pigs, several lawmakers from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
and the Taiwan Solidarity Union promised to propose an amendment to the Animal
Protection Law so as to bring animals raised for economic purposes under the
law's protection.</P>
      <P>According to Tzeng, only six of the 27 public slaughterhouses around Taiwan kill
their pigs in a humane way, namely by making the pigs lose consciousness with an
electric shock so that they feel no pain when they are slaughtered.</P>
      <P>The pigs at the other slaughterhouses are killed in a cruel manner, Tzeng said,
explaining that the pigs are first hung upside down by one of their legs and
then beaten unconscious with a stick before being slaughtered.</P>
      <P>At the press conference, several of the woman lawmakers were brought to tears
while watching the video on how cruelly the animals are treated.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Bi-khim, a DPP legislator, said that as a ruling party lawmaker, she feels
ashamed that the government has failed to punish the owners of the
slaughterhouses  that treat the animals so mercilessly. She promised to work
with other lawmakers to push for an amendment to the Animal Protection Law to
bring animals raised for economic purposes under the law's protection.</P>

      <P>A 19-year-old Shanghai man underwent bone marrow transplant surgery at a
Shanghai hospital early Thursday, receiving 700 ml of stem cells provided by
Taiwan's Tzu Chi Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Center.</P>
      <P>Fang Dongwei, who suffers from inherited anemia, was doing fine after the
surgery, doctors from the Shanghai Xinhua Hospital said.</P>
      <P>In a telephone conversation, Fang told CNA that although he does not know who
the donor is, he is profoundly grateful to the unnamed donor and to Taiwan's
Tzu Chi Buddhist Compassionate  Relief Foundation, which made the transplant
possible.</P>
      <P>Fang checked into the hospital last November with anemia, which doctors said
could be treated only with a bone marrow transplant.</P>
      <P>Three months later, the Tzu Chi Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Center said it had
found a compatible Taiwan donor.</P>
      <P>Before Fang received the bone marrow transplant, he underwent six rounds of
chemotherapy over the past four months to prepare for the donated bone marrow.</P>
      <P>According to Liang Hui,  director of the hospital's blood department, Fang's
body is expected to adapt to the transplanted stem cells in about three weeks
and he will be discharged from the hospital after two months of observation if
no signs of infection or rejection show during that period.</P>
      <P>In late March, a three-year-old Chinese boy received a bone marrow transplant
from a Taiwanese donor.</P>
      <P>The boy, surnamed Chiu, who also suffers from an inherited form of anemia,
received 600 ml of stem cells provided by the Tzu Chi Bone Marrow and Stem Cell
Center.</P>
      <P>Shanghai doctors previously predicted that without a bone marrow transplant, the
child would not have lived beyond the age of 12.</P>
      <P>So far the boy has been doing fine, according to hospital authorities.</P>
      <P>The Tzu Chi Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Center -- the largest of its kind in Asia
-- has built a databank of nearly 300,000 bone marrow samples since its
inception in 1993. It has helped more than 300 victims of blood diseases to find
donors.</P>
      <P>The center now has access to data on more than 10 million donors worldwide after
linking with two bone marrow databanks in the United States and Germany late
last year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has gone into full gear to mobilize party
lawmakers in the hope of blocking two key draft bills of great concern to its
future in a legislative committee meeting Friday.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, director of the KMT's Policy Coordination Committee, said that
all party lawmakers have been notified that they must attend the Procedure
Committee meeting Friday, in which two bills regarding the handling of the KMT's
assets and the banning of convicted individuals from future presidential
elections are on the agenda.</P>
      <P>The two bills, targeting the KMT's assets and its former chairman, Ma Ying-jeou,
who is making a strong presidential bid, were put on the committee's agenda
Tuesday as a result of the absence of lawmakers of the People First Party (PFP)
and the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU) to block the move.</P>
      <P>Tseng said he has confidence that with cooperation from PFP and NPSU lawmakers,
they will be able to reject the two draft bills in a concerted move in the
Friday meeting. The KMT has been mediating with the PFP and the NPSU on the
matter, he noted.</P>
      <P>Despite Tseng's call for PFP and NPSU collaboration, it remains unclear whether
the two parties will join KMT efforts in killing the two bills. The PFP, in
particular, has been at loggerheads with the KMT due to rows arising from the
May 12 by-election for Keelung mayor and December's legislative elections, even
though the two parties set up a new alliance in January that was supposed to
step up cooperation in coming elections.</P>
      <P>In response to the KMT's keen desire that PFP lawmakers help block the two
bills, PFP legislative caucus whip Fu Kun-chi said that seven or eight PFP
legislators have gone abroad and that he is not sure whether they will return
home to attend the Friday meeting.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Fu also said that the "PFP will not make it so that Ma misses the
chance to run in the 2008 presidential race " and added that the PFP will hold a
meeting later Thursday to discuss how to deal with the situation in Friday's
Procedure Committee meeting.</P>

      <P>The reconstruction of the late President Chiang Kai-shek's first official
residence in Taiwan will not be a problem, but finding the right kind of cypress
and the original Japanese tiles will be difficult, an emergency response panel
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The panel, which comprises structural specialist Tsai Teh-shin and Lee Chung-
yao, an authority on historical relics and heritage site restoration, visited
the wreckage of the Grass Mountain Chateau on Yangmingshan in suburban Taipei,
which was badly damaged during a fire earlier this month.</P>
      <P>The panel estimated that the cost of the reconstruction will be between NT$30
million (US$909,000) and NT$50 million and will take about two years to
complete.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that cinders from the fire will have to be collected and preserved. In
addition, the issue of fire and earthquake prevention will have to be taken into
consideration.</P>
      <P>Lee, a traditional architectural restoration master who played a leading role in
the building's first large-scale face-lift a few years ago, said he was saddened
to see the fire-ravaged site, but as the original design has been kept, "it will
be no problem to restore it to its original form, " although the methods and
skills will have to be studied.</P>
      <P>He noted that there is dirt, wood and lime in Taiwan, but Japanese tiles are no
longer produced here. The wooden structure of the original building employed
mainly Taiwan cypress and whether to use Taiwan cypress or foreign cypress --
which is three or four times more expensive -- will be up to the Taipei city
government to decide, he added.</P>
      <P>Lee Yung-ping, director of the city government's Department of Cultural Affairs,
claimed that the fire was most likely caused by arson. Police are still
investigating if the Buddhist Fo Kuang University, which has been commissioned
by the city government to manage the site since 2002, is guilty of negligence or
dereliction of duty.</P>
      <P>Lee also said the department has erected pickets around the building to bar
trespassers prior to the reconstruction work.</P>
      <P>The bureau will film the building materials and structure, restoration and
reconstruction process in a documentary, Lee added. All badly burned materials,
as well as the wreckage, will be kept for display for future generations to
learn about the importance of preserving heritage sites, she added.</P>
      <P>The style of the 660-square-meter main building of the chateau, on an estate
covering about 1,815 square meters, is typical of Japanese architecture of the
1920s. The wall of the entrance to the main building is made of stone, with a
Japanese wooden structure inside.</P>
      <P>The April 7 fire destroyed more than half of the main building, with the wooden
interior being completely burnt. The stone wall remains intact. Total damage is
estimated at roughly NT$36 million.</P>
      <P>The city government listed the building as a protected heritage site in 2002 and
it has since served as a cultural activity center that encompasses  an
exhibition  hall,  a small  showroom,  a multifunction auditorium, a performance
area, a semi-open air coffee shop and a management center.  The midnight fire
damaged the exhibition hall, known as Meilu Hall, and the coffee shop, known as
Yingho Hall.</P>

      <P>National Taiwan University (NTU) responded positively to an unannounced
emergency response test conducted by two lawmakers on its campus Wednesday, but
will not allow any more such tests by lawmakers in the school, a university
official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Fu Li-cheng, secretary-general of the university, pointed out that the school
already has an emergency response mechanism and was alarmed by Wednesday's
shooting rampage at Virginia Technology University in the United State, which
has sisterhood ties with NTU.</P>
      <P>Against this background,  Fu said his university was told Wednesday by Ministry
of Education (MOE) official Ker Hui-chen that a security test might be carried
out on its campus at an unspecified date.</P>
      <P>In light of the fact that half of the university's security personnel are
contracted workers rather than career police officers, Fu said his school
considered Wednesday's test a good chance to examine the school's strengths and
weaknesses in maintaining campus security.</P>
      <P>Fu said his school appreciates the concerns of media and lawmakers over its
security, but had no advance knowledge that the test had been conceived by the
two lawmakers, who made a hoax call to the police saying that three NTU students
had been taken hostage by gunmen on campus.</P>
      <P>The official said the lawmakers and police officers who responded to their hoax
call were allowed by university authorities to enter the school Wednesday, but
said the university would refuse to allow similar tests in the future.</P>
      <P>As a result of the lawmakers' hoax call, 55 police officers equipped with rifles
and anti-terrorist gear rushed to the university to handle the purported gunmen,
only to be greeted by a crowd of TV cameramen called in by the two lawmakers.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers, Lee Chen-nan and Lin Kuo-ching of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, apologized Thursday after being blasted by the media for
orchestrating a publicity stunt, fooling the police and causing panic among
students.</P>
      <P>Ker denied that the MOE played a support role in the two lawmakers' scheme,
claiming that all she knew was that the lawmakers, who sit on a legislative
committee that controls the ministry's purse strings, wanted to check NTU's

      <P>Taiwan's economy is expected to grow only moderately this year, as the global
economic growth will advance at a slower pace than last year, the Chung-Hua
Institution for Economic Research (CIER) predicted Thursday.</P>
      <P>CIER researchers forecast that Taiwan's gross domestic product (DGP) will
advance 4.17 percent this year, slightly higher than the 4.13 percent that was
predicted by the institution late last year, but would be lower than the growth
of 4.62 percent posted for 2006.</P>
      <P>For 2008, CIER researchers painted a rosier picture, with the DGP growth topping
4.23 percent.</P>
      <P>CIER researcher Chou Chi forecast that the 2007 global economic growth  will be
slower  than  last  year,  mainly  due to a slower-than-expected U.S. domestic
economy, which would reflect a number of negative phenomena, including flat real

      <P>CIER forecast that consumption in the private sector will grow by 2.8 percent
this year, up 1.27 percentage points from the 1.53 percent of 2006.</P>
      <P>Domestic investment is seen to grow by 1.82 percent this year, marking a modest
growth of 0.2 percent over the year-earlier level, but the substantive domestic
investment rate is expected to stand at a low of 15.44 percent this year -- a
level still considered too low in this regard.</P>
      <P>CIER researchers predicted that domestic investment and export trade of goods
and services will all gain momentum in the second half of the year, although
private consumption will be unlikely to grow that briskly.</P>
      <P>According to a CIER estimate, Taiwan's consumer price index (CPI) will register
an annual growth of 1.25 percent this year, 0.65 percentage points higher than
the year-earlier level, mainly as a result of rising prices of raw materials on
the global market.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the institution forecast that Taiwan's unemployment rate in 2007 will
be around 3.91 percent, a slight improvement over the previous year, although
the jobless rate is expected to top 4 percent in the third quarter.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DESMOND TUTU MEETS FAMILIES OF 228 VICTIMS</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Anglican Archbishop of South Africa Desmond Mpilo Tutu met Thursday with
family members of victims of Taiwan's 228 Incident of 1947 and said forgiveness
is the major road to reconciliation.</P>
      <P>Tutu, who became famous during the 1980s as an opponent of apartheid in South
Africa and who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984, arrived in Taipei Wednesday
with Alexander Boraine, founding father of the International Center for
Transitional Justice, for a week-long visit at the invitation of the Taiwan
Foundation for Democracy.</P>
      <P>Tutu also visited early Thursday a former execution ground for political
prisoners during the period of Taiwan's martial law and the 228 Peace Memorial
Hall in downtown Taipei, where he met family members of victims of the 228
Incident, an uprising against the corrupt Kuomintang (KMT) administration that
began Feb. 28, 1947, which led to the murder of thousands of civilians.</P>
      <P>Tutu told the families of the victims that he was not here to "teach" Taiwan how
to resolve the disputes and problems resulting from historical tragedy, but
rather to "share" his experiences in this regard.</P>
      <P>The method chosen by South Africa was to set up a truth and reconciliation
commission to allow the public to know about the reality and to face it, Tutu
said, adding that he was glad to hear the stories of the family members of the
Taiwanese victims.</P>
      <P>Noting that unveiling a country's history and memory is an important beginning,
Tutu said allowing the families of the victims to tell their stories is the best
way to heal their pain and that in the meantime the country can heal society's
pain during the process of pursuing the truth.</P>
      <P>He said he saw many South African people who suffered persecution in the past
still with anger in their faces and trying to take revenge. However, Tutu added
that he saw gentle faces among the Taiwanese sufferers, saying that the
suffering of these people brought democracy and human rights to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For his part, Boraine noted that South Africa and Taiwan are far apart
geographically  but have similar miserable histories and therefore have many
voices calling for justice.</P>
      <P>Describing the truth as "bitter as herbal medicine," Boraine said however that
it can bring healing power to the country and that the process of pursuing the
truth can bring hope to the people.</P>
      <P>Concluding his visit to the 228 Peace Memorial Hall, Tutu left a note that
included the words: "here is acknowledgment of painful history, pray that their
beautiful island will become reconciled and healed."</P>
      <P>Tutu, who became the first black person to lead the Anglican Church in South
Africa Sept. 7, 1986, headed the country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission
after the end of apartheid. He has also contributed significantly to the
safeguarding of democracy and human rights around the world community.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Supreme Court upheld Thursday a ruling of the Taiwan High Court that former
President Lee Teng-hui should apologize to James Soong, chairman of the
opposition People First Party, and compensate him for defamation.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court ruled that Lee should run apology ads in three local
newspapers for one day and pay NT$2 million (US$60,600) in compensation.</P>
      <P>At issue is Lee's insinuation in a public speech that Soong was playing mahjong
with friends April 10, 2004 while his followers were fighting with police in a
street protest against President Chen Shui-bian's re-election victory the
previous month.</P>
      <P>Soong filed a defamation suit and the Taipei District Court ruled in November
2005 that Lee should compensate Soong NT$10 million and run ads in nine local
newspapers to apologize to him.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court ruled in August 2006 that as a former national leader, Lee
should know his remarks carry weight, but his insinuation of Soong turning back
on his supporters to play mahjong led the public to see Soong as an
irresponsible politician, causing him "great emotional distress" and therefore
deserving of compensation.</P>
      <P>As compensation in previous defamation suits have not exceeded NT$3 million, the
high court slashed the amount from NT$10 million to NT$2 million.</P>
      <P>In view that the case has been widely publicized, the high court also ruled that
the request for running apology ads for three consecutive days in nine local
newspapers, which would cost an estimated NT$13 million, should be cut to one
day ads on the front pages of three national newspapers.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has been ranked the world's 29th largest "tourism economy," with its
tourism industry contributing 4.52 percent of its total gross domestic product
(GDP) for 2006, an official of the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Quoting statistics compiled by the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTCC), the
official said that Taiwan had over 3.52 million foreign visitors in 2006,
151,207 of whom came only for sightseeing, an increase of 9.3 percent over the
previous year.</P>
      <P>Tourists spent US$34.43 billion in 2006, a rise of 5.75 percent year-on-year,
higher than the global average of 4.85 percent. Of this amount, direct
consumption in transportation, housing and shopping accounted for US$4.19
billion, representing 1.18 percent of the total GDP, according to the
statistics, the official said, adding that the amount has helped to create
170,000 jobs.</P>
      <P>The official said the tourism industry's  good performance indicates that the
government's marketing strategy has worked and he added that the CEPD is
confident Taiwan tourism will achieve a better ranking in the future.</P>

      <P>Although the total number of incidents at schools and universities nationwide
was down in 2006, the number of reported cases of on-campus bullying was on the
rise, according to statistics released Thursday by the Ministry of Education
(MOE).</P>
      <P>MOE statistics showed that a total of 14,638 incidents were reported last year
at all levels of educational facilities around the country, down by 1,190 cases
from the 2005 figure. However, the number of incidents involving security
maintenance, violence and misconduct accounted for 21.2 percent of the total, or
3,116 cases, which marked a 6.4 percent growth year on year.</P>
      <P>Twenty-nine students were killed last year due to on-campus bullying,
harassment, extortion, robbery or running away from home, while 1,097 were
injured, MOE tallies indicated.</P>
      <P>Accidents remained the main cause of student deaths on campus last year, with
648 killed and 7,420 wounded.</P>
      <P>The recent shooting that killed more than 30 students and staff by a South
Korean student at Virginia Tech in the United States has shocked the entire
world, prompting the MOE to stay on high alert against violence on campus.</P>
      <P>According to officials from the MOE's Bureau of Students Military Training, the
ministry has for some time been running a series of programs aimed at
reinforcing order and security at all levels of schools, including the

      <P>Over 1,000 tea growers from Nantou County in central Taiwan are slated to stage
a protest Friday in front of the Legislative Yuan against the importation of
substandard foreign tea that is seriously threatening their livelihoods.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Lin Yun-sheng, who will lead some 1,600 tea farmers from local
townships to demonstrate in front of the Legislative Yuan Friday, said Nantou
tea growers want fair competition, but imported low-end foreign products have
ruined the home market.</P>
      <P>Nantou County is one of Taiwan's major tea production sites, and its Oolong tea
is famous around the world.</P>
      <P>According to tea farmers from Mingchien township, business losses have amounted
to NT$275 million in recent years after at least 24,000 metric tons of foreign-
grown tea were imported into Taiwan at low customs rates.</P>
      <P>Apart from their financial losses, they said, these substandard foreign  goods
lack certificates  or labels identifying  their country-of-origin,  or verifying
that they have passed strict quarantine controls, and so pose a great risk to
the health of Taiwanese consumers.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Tang Huo-shen told a Legislative Yuan news conference early this week
that large amounts of cheap foreign tea are being imported into Taiwan everyday,
packaged as a locally grown product, and sold on the domestic market.</P>
      <P>Last year, more than 25,000 metric tons of tea from China and Vietnam, along
with that of other countries, were imported into Taiwan. This low-priced foreign
tea, after being disguised as Taiwanese-grown goods, was sold for around NT$350
per kilogram in the domestic market, according to Tang.</P>

      <P>If the government approves all major pending development projects, it would
become a menace to the world community, several members of a task force
commissioned to make environment impact assessment warned Thursday.</P>
      <P>Five members of the task force, including Rubin Winkler, Lee Keng-cheng, Hsu
Kuang-jung, Chou Chin-cheng and Chan Shun-kuei appealed to the Executive Yuan to
make that environment a priority during a news conference. The sixth member, Kuo
Hung-yu, although not present, signed his name to the joint written statement.</P>
      <P>Members of the task force asked the Executive Yuan not to accommodate the wishes
of the big enterprises and turn the task force into a "rubber stamp" that simply
endorses development projects.</P>
      <P>The task force currently has 21 members comprised of seven members designated by
the government, including the minister and vice minister of the Environmental
Protection Administration (EPA), and 14 scholars and experts.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, in creating US$1 million worth of gross domestic product, will produce
an estimated 8.5 million tons of carbon dioxide, said the members citing
statistics released by the EPA,</P>
      <P>If several major development projects, including a steel refinery plant, two
thermal power plants and one petrochemical park, all pass their environmental
impact assessments, emissions of carbon dioxide will surge by 43.44 percent,
turning the island into a menace to the world community, which has demonstrated
an ever-stronger desire to cut emissions of greenhouse gases. q In addition,
water demands associated with major development projects will also be a problem,
they said.</P>
      <P>An initial estimate shows that water requirements from the industrial sector
will increase by 121.7 tons daily to reach 440 million tons annually, equal to
the household consumption of nearly 5 million people for the year: an amount
equal to all the waters of the Feitsui Reservoir.</P>
      <P>Lee expressed concern that additional water for the Central Taiwan Science Park
is coming from a reservoir which is being required to cope with the constantly
increasing needs of the flat panel factories, and that as factories are being
given priority irrigation projects are getting recycled waters. This results in
"good water for the industrial sector and poor water for the agricultural
sector," Lee claimed.</P>
      <P>Chan, concerned about the air quality in central Taiwan, said the area already
hosts a thermal power plant, sixth naphtha cracker and the Central Taiwan
Science Park. If other development projects, including the Formosa Plastics
Group's steel refinery, also pass environmental impact review, the air quality
could deteriorate to levels that may compromise public health.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's household debt situation will take a turn for the better later this
year in light of rising household incomes and other factors, said a credit card
company Thursday.</P>
      <P>The sitution is easing thanks to a rising per capita income, the continuing
appreciation of the New Taiwanese dollar against the U.S. dollar, and a six-year
low in the country's unemployment rate -- all of which contribute to a stronger
domestic economy, said Wang Yue-hun, a chief researcher with MasterCard Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang said Taiwan's household debt reached its apex between 2004 and 2005 when
each credit card holders held on average four to five credit cards and household
debt rose to 95.5 percent of total household income.</P>
      <P>In December 2005, said Wang, credit card spending totaled NT$494.7 billion, and
by February 2006, about 520,000 consumers faced a combined debt of NT$160
billion in credit or cash card debt.</P>
      <P>The situation has noticeably improved since early 2006 in the wake of strong
intervention by the government, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Wang added that after financial reforms were implemented over the past two
years, the overhead and operational costs of lenders and other financial
institutions have fallen, which has contributed to shoring  up  Taiwan's
substantive  foreign  exchange  rate competitiveness.</P>

      <P>Despite a keen desire on the part of the Kuomintang (KMT) that they join forces
in a vote Friday on two key bills in a legislative committee, People First Party
(PFP) lawmakers said Thursday that they may absent themselves from the vote if
the KMT fails to keep its promise regarding upcoming elections.</P>
      <P>PFP legislative caucus whip Feng Ting-kuo made the comments after the KMT issued
a call earlier the same day urging PFP lawmakers to attend the Procedure
Committee meeting and help their KMT peers defeat two key draft bills that are
of great concern to the KMT.</P>
      <P>The two bills, initiated by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) ,
target the main opposition KMT's assets and could rule out former KMT Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou's presidential bid. They were successfully placed on the
committee's agenda Monday during the absence of PFP and Non-Partisan Solidarity
Union lawmakers.</P>
      <P>According to Feng, the matter is simple, so long as the KMT lives up to its
promise to allot to the PFP 10 regional and three at-large seats in December's
legislative elections.</P>
      <P>"Should the KMT honor its promise, there will be room for the PFP to alter its

party, and voiced his discontent, asking how the KMT could turn a blind eye to
the agreement reached late last year with the PFP.</P>

might not vote, if the KMT refuses to honor its pledge.</P>
      <P>"All PFP legislators will act in concert regarding Friday's vote in the
Procedure Committee, based on a consensus that will be reached that same day by
the central committee," he said.</P>
      <P>KMT officials, including Secretary-General Wu Duen-yih, and legislative caucus

The Supreme Court reversed course on abortion on Wednesday, upholding the

The most important vote was that of the newest justice, Samuel A. Alito Jr. In
another 5-to-4 decision seven years ago, his predecessor, Justice Sandra Day
OConnor, voted to strike down a similar state law. Justice Alitos vote to uphold
the federal law made the difference in the outcome announced Wednesday.

Wall Street Journal:As Mumbai Grows, Commuter Trains Turn Deadly

There was a time, just a few years ago, when Jagdish Malwankar had no problem
getting a seat on the Valsad express commuter train that takes him to work in
the city center.

Today, Mumbai's trains are so overcrowded that one morning in January when he
stumbled getting off a train, 10 people fell on him and he broke his foot.
Another day recently, in the crush to board, fellow commuters shoved him onto
the tracks. Two train cars passed over him before anyone noticed he had fallen.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWANIHA PUBLISHES PHOTO ALBUM RECORDING TAIWAN' HUMANITARIAN AID</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan International Health Action (TaiwanIHA), a government-funded
organization to offer international medical aid, published Thursday a photo
album recording Taiwan's medical humanitarian aid to foreign countries from 2000
through 2006.</P>
      <P>Minister of Health Hou Sheng-mao, Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang,
Executive Director of the International Center for Migration and Health (ICMH)
Manuel Carballo, and several foreign envoys stationed in Taiwan attended the
launch of the album, titled "Passion and Care," at MOFA's personnel training
center in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Hou said the establishment of the TaiwanIHA was a concrete reflection of
Taiwan's contribution to the world community, which he said has significantly
strengthened Taiwan's relations with other countries.</P>
      <P>Huang said Taiwan  is striving  to join the World Health Organization (WHO) as a
full member, and expressed the hope that the world community will extend its
support to Taiwan's bid.</P>
      <P>Peter Chang, director of the Bureau of International Cooperation of the
Department of Health, said since the TaiwanIHA's inception in 2006, it has sent
medical delegations to extend aid in more than 10 disasters, including tsunami-
struck areas in South Asia and the Solomon Islands, a landslide in the
Philippines, earthquake in Indonesia, and flood in Kenya.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, during its recent trip to the Solomon Islands,  the boat
carrying workers from TaiwanIHA  and other international humanitarian aid
organizations ran aground on the way to the country's capital.</P>
      <P>Despite of this and other hazards, Taiwan will not hesitate to extend its
helping hand to other countries in need, Chang stressed.</P>

      <P>"Taiwan" and the country's official title, "Republic of China", will appear
together for the first time on the same set of local stamps, slated for launch
April 25, executives from Taiwan Post Co. said Thursday.</P>
      <P>This will be the last time that Taiwan's official title will appear on stamps
issued by the state-owned company, the executives said.</P>
      <P>The new stamps, to be issued later this month featuring the lesser panda, are
the last set of animal-themed Republic of China stamps. The printing of that set
was completed before the company changed its name, the executives noted.</P>
      <P>Since the postal company changed its name from Chunghwa Post to Taiwan Post
earlier this year, the name "Republic of China" will no longer appear on local
stamps, they went on.</P>
      <P>The name change is part of the government's efforts to remove references of
"China" or "Chinese" from the titles of state-owned companies to avoid confusion
with similarly named counterparts in China. "Chunghwa" means "China" in
Mandarin.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EU ENVOY URGES TAIWAN TO INVEST MORE IN EUROPE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 20 (CNA)
04/20/07  13:09:57
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is welcome to invest more in Europe as the continent has emerged as the
world's largest single market with terrific profitability, the new
representative of the 25-state European Union (EU) in Taiwan said Friday.</P>
      <P>Guy Ledoux, head of the European Economic and Trade Office in Taiwan, which
represents EU interests here, pointed out that while the EU is now Taiwan's
largest foreign investor, Taiwan's investment in European countries is
comparatively low.</P>
      <P>According to Ledoux, accumulated EU investment in Taiwan has roughly hit 11.5
billion euro (US$15.64 billion), surpassing the amount invested by either the
United States or Japan.</P>
      <P>Ledoux said that in contrast, it seems to him that Taiwanese entrepreneurs
remain very cautious about launching  investment projects in the EU To the best
of his knowledge, Ledoux said, Taiwan even lags behind the Philippines in terms
of EU investments. He didn't provide exact figures.</P>
      <P>On the trade front, Ledoux said Taiwan remains one of the EU's major trading
partners, with two-way trade reaching 40 billion euro for 2006, compared to 46
billion euro in EU-India trade and 44 billion euro in EU-Brazil trade.</P>
      <P>Looking forward, Ledoux said Taiwan-EU trade will continue to expand in 2007
after posting growth of 6.8 percent last year. In 2006, Ledoux said, Taiwan
registered an increase of 10 percent in its exports to the EU, but its imports
from the 25-state trade bloc only grew 1.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Ledoux said he will give priority to bolstering trade and investment between the
EU and Taiwan, with reinforced intellectual property rights (IPR) protection as
the primary theme.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, Ledoux delivered his first public speech since taking office here
six weeks ago at a lunch meeting of the European Chamber of Commerce in Taipei
(ECCT).</P>
      <P>Ledoux said in that speech that Taiwan is heading in the right direction with
regards to improving IPR protection. However, he added, there are also less
encouraging moves, such as compulsory licensing.</P>
      <P>Noting that his office will aim to tackle restrictive trade measures adopted by
local government authorities, Ledoux said he will step up communications with
them to facilitate his work.</P>
      <P>While the EU is negotiating bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs) with its key
trade partners, including South Korea, India and ASEAN, Ledoux told ECCT members
that it will be some time before the EU is able to evaluate the feasibility of
signing a similar pact with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Factors affecting the possibility of an FTA being signed between Taiwan and the
EU include whether European companies see any need for or benefits from such a
deal and whether Taiwan's government is interested in signing such an accord,
Ledoux explained.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Ledoux also mentioned another task on his agenda, namely urging
Taiwan to sign the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) , which he said would
allow European corporations to bid for government tenders in Taiwan as well as
give their Taiwanese counterparts access to European government projects.</P>
      <P>Taiwan had promised to join the GPA before its accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) in 2002, but it has had difficulties delivering on that
promise because of opposition from China over terminology to be used in the
contract.</P>
      <P>Due to China's reluctance to recognize Taiwan's sovereign status, Taiwan has
been unable to conclude GPA negotiations with other WTO members as the issues
regarding the titles of its government agencies have not been resolved.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officials have said that the government can
be flexible with regard to the form of Taiwan's participation in the GPA, but it
cannot afford to budge on the nomenclature issue.</P>
      <P>"We deserve the same treatment as other member states and will only join the GPA
on the condition that our national dignity and sovereignty remain intact, " an
official with the MOFA's Department of Economic and Trade Affairs said earlier
this year.</P>
      <P>On this issue, Ledoux said he believes that any disputes surrounding the GPA can
be settled through negotiations.</P>
      <P>Born in Strasbourg,  France,  Ledoux  joined  the European Commission-- the EU's
executive arm -- in 1990. He has held a number of posts in trade and foreign
relations in the Asia Department, the Middle East Department and the European
Neighborhood Policy Department. He has also served in Tunisia and South Korea as
deputy head of mission.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW ROC ENVOY TO U.S. MEETS WITH TAIWAN-FRIENDLY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 19 (CNA)
04/20/07  13:24:54

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's new representative to the United States, Joseph Wu, paid courtesy calls
on two leaders of the U.S. Congress Taiwan Caucus Thursday to exchange views on
issues of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>Wu, who formally assumed his post in Washington, D.C. Monday, met with Steve
Chabot (R-Ohio) and Shelley Berkley (D-Nev.) at their respective offices on
Capitol Hill.</P>
      <P>Wu said that although differences exist on certain issues between Taiwan and the
United States, Taipei is determined to consult and communicate with Washington
in a "frank and sincere manner."</P>
      <P>As to Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Organization (WHO) and to sign a
free trade agreement (FTA) with the United States, Wu said that although both
goals "may appear impossible at the moment, " he is undaunted by the task and
will relentlessly pursue these goals.</P>
      <P>Wu said he explained to the two Taiwan Caucus leaders that the the U.S.-South
Korea FTA, signed earlier this month, has put Taiwan at a disadvantage and that
it will undermine Taiwan's economic development.</P>
      <P>Wu expressed his strong wish that the U.S. Congress will bear in mind the "deep
and wide" business and trade relations between Taiwan and the United States and
push for the signing of an FTA between the two sides.</P>
      <P>He further said that in their meeting, Chabot told him that a U.S-Taiwan FTA is
in the best interests of the United States and that many members of Congress
from both the Democratic and Republican parties are interested in pursuing such
a pact.</P>
      <P>On the issue of Taiwan's plan to bid for entry into the WHO as a full member
under the name "Taiwan, " Chabot said it's "high time" for Taiwan to do so,
according to Wu.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately,  Wu continued, Chabot further said that the People's Republic of
China has persistently obstructed Taiwan's bid but that he and other Taiwan
Caucus members will nevertheless continue to make efforts relentlessly toward
that goal despite the fact that just getting the State Department's support will
be a major challenge.</P>
      <P>For her part, Berkley told Wu that she and other Taiwan Caucus co-chairs will
jointly initiate a proposal shortly to urge the Bush administration to begin
working on matters regarding the signing of an FTA with Taiwan and that she
anticipates that other members of the caucus will also join the effort in the
near future.</P>
      <P>Berkley added that three other Taiwan Caucus co-chairs -- Representatives Robert
Wexler (D-FLa.) , Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) and Steve Chabot -- will all sign
the proposal to push the Bush administration to take concrete steps toward
forging an FTA with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's latest plan to seek to join the WHO as a full member under the name
"Taiwan, " Berkley told Wu that it is a critical issue as all of Taiwan's 23
million people are entitled to that right and privilege, adding that she
supports the "Taiwan" initiative and will try her utmost to help Taiwan reach
that goal.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NOBEL LAUREATE TUTU TALKS ABOUT RECONCILIATION DURING TAIWAN VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 20 (CNA)
04/20/07  14:47:57
(By Y.C. Jou)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>On an eight-day visit in Taiwan, former South African Anglican Church Archbishop
Desmond Mpilo Tutu said he was shaken by the size of a mound that grew out of
the soil one shovel scoop at a time to cover the bloodshed of countless shooting
executions in the early period of Kuomintang rule, at a site which is now known
as Machangting Memorial Park.</P>
      <P>"The height [of the mound] is very telling, for it indicates just how many
people were shot there. It is a silent but very powerful image," he said.</P>
      <P>The 1984 Nobel Peace Prize winner who made a great contribution to ending
apartheid in South Africa and facilitating reconciliation made the remarks in an
interview with members of the press at the Grand Hotel in Taipei Thursday
afternoon during his visit in Taiwan which has been organized by the Taiwan
Foundation for Democracy with the theme of transitional justice.</P>
      <P>Tutu said he has no specific advice for Taiwan regarding transitional justice
but hopes that "the people will learn some of the lessons we learnt, such as
that you cannot go on as a country unless you acknowledge your past."</P>
      <P>Presented with a question regarding historical truth often being vulnerable to
manipulation by politicians,  Tutu expressed his confidence in society's ability
to find out and face its unpleasant past.</P>
      <P>"There are people like ourselves, scholars, and many others, who are able to put
forward a correct version of history, and to point out in fact that it does not
help to try to deceive yourself, " he said.</P>
      <P>"The best way is to look at your past very firmly in the eyes. We need to look
at the beast in the eye, then we'll have the opportunity to advance. Otherwise,
the beast of the dark past will return to haunt us," he said.</P>
      <P>He said that he found that elements of the stories of Taiwan's 228 Incident and
White Terror told to him by victims and their family members whom he met with
that day echoed what he experienced and saw in South Africa as well as Northern
Ireland.</P>
      <P>"People tend to think that victims are angry, nurse grudges and are prepared to
get revenge. However, the victims I met with have gentle faces, are generous,
and really want to move on," he said.</P>
      <P>"I think most of all it's the dignity of these people that makes them such an
impressive group of people, " he said, adding that the point is that these
people want to know what really happened to their loved ones and that it is
important that this need is met.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he thinks South Africa has moved on, Tutu said that it has, "to
some extent."</P>
      <P>"We have not arrived at a destination, but reconciliation is not a just
destination, it is also a journey. It is a process in which every single one of
us is expected to make a contribution, " he explained.</P>
      <P>South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) takes an approach that,
described by Tutu in his 1999 book "No Future Without Forgiveness",  neither
seeks a large-scale  pursuit of former perpetrators, like what happened in
Nuremburg, Germany after World War II, nor simply opts to forget about the past
like countries such as Chile did. Instead, the South African system requires
that those who participated in repression fully confess to their deeds in the
TRC hearings, face-to-face with the victims and their families, in order to be
entitled to a pardon.</P>
      <P>When it comes to forgiveness on the victim's part, Tutu said, it is not to be
expected that those who have suffered will suddenly "like" those who did evil to

position where you're always a victim. But if you're ready to forgive, you're
not an object, you're active, and the initiative is yours. You're in charge, "
he said.</P>
      <P>He further said that he believes people eventually find out the facts. "It is
much better and easier to be friends than to be enemies, and peace is much
cheaper than war," he added.</P>
      <P>Tutu denied a media report that he had not visited Taiwan during the last 12

    <HEADLINE>BITTER RIVALRY DOES NOT HELP DPP'S ELECTION CHANCES: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian called for unity Friday among the four contenders
vying to become the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) 2008
presidential candidate, saying that bitter rivalry will not help the DPP win the
election.</P>
      <P>Chen said unity is the one and only option for the DPP to pursue ahead of the
2008 presidential race.</P>
      <P>He described rivals as "mirrors" from which the DPP aspirants can discover their
own shortcomings, adding that competition helps broaden people's vision and
breadth of mind.</P>
      <P>The president said that bitter campaign moves and rhetoric will not make the
contenders more popular, adding that they are also unacceptable to DPP members
and the contenders' supporters.</P>
      <P>Chen called for the four contenders -- Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su
Tseng-chang, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and former Premier Frank Hsieh -- not to
underestimate the wisdom and determination of the voters who support the DPP.</P>
      <P>Saying that internal competition within the DPP should not be turned into
contradiction between the ruling and opposition parties and that temporary
rivals should not become eternal enemies, Chen pointed out that only when people
know how to "yield" can they manage to "obtain" and only when they are willing
to forgo the interests of "their small selves" can they make "big achievements"
for the country.</P>
      <P>Chen said that only one of the four aspirants will be selected to be the DPP's
presidential candidate but that this final decision will not represent victory
for only that one person chosen or defeat for the other three. Rather, he said,
producing a successful DPP candidate who has the best chance of winning the 2008
presidential race will represent a victory for the whole party as well as for
Taiwan's democracy.</P>
      <P>The period leading up to the DPP primary is a time when the four aspirants'
wisdom and cultivation will be tested, Chen stressed.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to travel to the southern city of Chiayi Saturday to listen to
the second televised presentation during which the four DPP aspirants will
present their views on how to govern the country.</P>

      <P>The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) will hold a series of social activities
for Chinese spouses of Taiwanese citizens to make counseling on everyday life
issues available, beginning with a garden party to be held at the end of May in
Taichung in central Taiwan, SEF Legal Affairs Director Ho Wu-liang said Friday.</P>
      <P>The party follows up on a counseling seminar held in March to help Chinese
spouses cope with the challenges they face finding a job or residence, acquiring
an identification card, or accessing medical services, Ho said, adding that the
SEF will hold other such activities after the garden party.</P>
      <P>Ho said the social gatherings allow local officials to learn what problems
Chinese spouses have adjusting to life in Taiwan, and to improve services for
them. For instance, the Employment Services Center under the Council of Labor

qualifications, but needs to overcome any particular barriers that may exist, Ho

      <P>Despite the ongoing controversy in Taiwan society surrounding the late President
Chiang Kai-shek's legacy, the Tourism Bureau came up Friday with tour packages
featuring Chiang in an attempt to lure more Chinese tourists to the country.</P>
      <P>The bureau under the Ministry of Transportation and Communication produced the
tour packages in response to an April 11 proposal made by Legislator Yeh Yi-jin
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, who suggested during a question-and-
answer session at the Legislative Yaun that government authorities draw up
Chiang-related tour packages exclusively catering to Chinese tourists as
everything connected with Chiang is of great interest to them, tourism officials
said.</P>
      <P>The packages involve some of Chiang's well-known residences around the country,
including the Jiaobanshan resort park in northern Taoyuan County, the Shihlin
Official Residence in Taipei City, the Hsitsu Bay Chateau in the southern port
city of Kaohsiung, the Chengching Building in Kaohsiung City, the Tsuenta
Chateau in central Nantou County and the Yangming Chateau in suburban Taipei ,
according to the officials.</P>
      <P>A tourism operator quoted recent tallies as showing that a total of 15,800
Chinese tourists visited Taiwan during the first quarter of this year, down 18
percent from the same period of last year. The decline is possibly due to a new
measure requiring that Chinese citizens traveling to Taiwan in tour groups pay
at least US$80 per day for boarding and lodging, he added.</P>

      <P>Eyeing the great potential of Taiwan's machine tool and component industries,
the government will allocate NT$630 million (US$19.09 million) over the next
four years as part of a plan to enhance the sector's global competitiveness,
government officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>Based on recent developments, the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) forecasts that the annual production of
machine tool and parts industries will both reach NT$340 billion by 2015.</P>
      <P>In 2006, the overall machinery sector was expected to have a total output of
NT$800 billion, and it is hoped to become the next trillion dollar industry,
following the semiconductor and color monitor industries, IDB officials said.</P>
      <P>The machine tool industry, which plays a crucial role in the overall machinery
sector, generated a record high production value of more than NT$100 billion in
2005, officials indicated, adding that this splendid performance pushed the
development  of machinery components industry to even higher output values,
exceeding NT$100 billion in 2005 and NT$125 billion in 2006.</P>
      <P>With a view to still greater developments in the promising sector, the IDB plans
to initiate an upgrading project, which it hopes will make Taiwan one of the
world's three largest manufacturers of machinery components, and the main
research and development center for advanced and high-precision machinery
components in Asia, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The IDB predicted that the project will help establish in Taiwan 10 flagship
machine tool enterprises with a production value of more than NT$10 billion
each.</P>

      <P>Nationwide 1.75 megawatts of electricity were conserved around noon Friday, over
and above the amount conserved April 16, the result of a variety of factors,
including a"turn-off-the-lights for one hour" campaign, according to the state-
owned Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower).</P>
      <P>The additional electrical savings translate into a reduction of 100,000 metric
tons of carbon dioxide, comparable to the amount of carbon dioxide that an area
of forest covering 442 meters squared would absorb in a year, Taipower officials
said.</P>
      <P>Quoting islandwide records of electrical consumption, Taipower authorities said
that energy use decreased by 56.17 MW islandwide at 12:18 p.m., down from the
peak posted on 12 noon of the same day.</P>
      <P>By comparison, they said, electrical consumption decreased by 54.42 MW
islandwide at 12: 24 p.m. on April 16, down from the peak at 12 noon of the same
day.</P>
      <P>April 16 was chosen as a basis of comparison because the weather patterns of
that day were similar to Friday's weather conditions, they added.</P>
      <P>Taipower officials said that the "turn-off-the-lights for one hour" campaign can
be considered one of the contributing factors behind the greater decrease in
electrical consumption on Friday, compared to April 16.</P>
      <P>They said daily energy consumption is determined by a variety of reasons,
including weather conditions and the brightness of the day.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tien Chiu-chin of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party proposed
several days ago that Taiwan public should take part in a "turn-off-the-lights
for one hour" campaign, switching lights, air conditioners and electrical
equipment off from noon to 1 p.m. April 20 in a bid to lessen consumption of
energy.</P>
      <P>The campaign is part of efforts to mark the April 22 Earth Day, observed around
the globe to raise awareness of the environment, particularly at a time when
additional efforts are being made around the world to help slow global warming,
which scientists attribute to the greenhouse effect, which is a direct result of
emissions of carbon dioxide and fossil fuel pollutants.</P>

      <P>The Environmental Administration (EPA) has imposed fines on 10 individuals for
trying to sell unlicensed environmental chemicals online, an EPA official said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen Shu-ling, a section chief with the EPA's Department of Environmental
Sanitation and Toxic Substance Management, said the 10 people  are repeat
offenders  who tried  to sell  unlicensed environmental chemicals through the
Yahoo-Kimo and PChome online auction networks.</P>
      <P>She added that first-time offenders would usually receive a written admonishment
from the EPA, but for repeat offenders, the EPA would likely level fines varying
from NT$60,000 to NT$300,000.</P>
      <P>Chen said some of the cases involved individuals and pet shop owners who bought
mosquito repellent incense and cockroach bait during holiday trips to Japan and
then tried to sell their leftover chemicals via the online auction.</P>
      <P>The environmental official added that in several cases, the EPA had to mete out
harsh fines because the offenders had exaggerated the effectiveness of the
unlicensed chemicals in their promotional descriptions,  thereby  violating
regulations  governing  toxic environmental chemicals.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, under Taiwanese law, each passenger is allowed to carry one
kilogram of licensed or unlicensed environmental chemicals through the customs

      <P>A draft amendment to the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall
Law pushed by ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers failed Friday
at the legislative Procedure Committee after opposition parties joined forces to
reject it.</P>
      <P>The draft bill,  widely assumed to target main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
former Chairman Ma Ying-jeou as it would effectively ban him from running in the
next presidential race, was blocked by KMT lawmakers and their allies in the
People First Party (PFP) and the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU) by a vote
of 100 to 97 in favor of a KMT proposal that the committee meeting be adjourned.</P>
      <P>PFP legislative caucus whip Fu Kun-chi said caucus members agreed to back the
KMT's proposal after the KMT demonstrated good faith earlier the same day with
regards to cooperation between the two parties in December's legislative
elections and the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>PFP lawmaker Feng Ting-kuo said that the KMT has two weeks to delve into the
issue pertaining to KMT-PFP cooperation in the coming elections.</P>
      <P>If the KMT fails to live up to promises made late last year on the allotment of
10 regional and three at-large seats to the PFP in the year-end legislative
election, PFP lawmakers will not attend the next meeting of the Procedure
Committee, making it possible for the DPP and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU), to again place the draft amendment on the agenda, Feng said.</P>
      <P>The KMT has struggled since Thursday to persuade PFP and NPSU lawmakers to join
forces with the KMT to block the bill in Friday's Procedure Committee meeting
from being put forth for a second reading.</P>
      <P>Along with the bill aimed at preventing Ma from taking part in the next
presidential election, another TSU-proposed bill targeting the KMT's assets was
also barred from being assigned for a second reading.</P>
      <P>In the face of the two bills' failure at the Procedure Committee, DPP
legislative caucus whip Ker Chien-ming accused the KMT of "working for its own
destruction."</P>
      <P>TSU legislative  caucus whip Tseng Tsahn-deng  called  the obstruction by the
KMT and the PFP "a shame" that renders each "a laughingstock." He then blasted
the two parties for "covering up a corrupt criminal."</P>
      <P>Ma was indicted in mid-February  by Taipei prosecutors on corruption charges in
a case related to his alleged embezzlement of some NT$11 million in funds from a
special monthly municipal allowance earmarked for his discretionary use during
his two terms as mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VISITING NOBEL PEACE PRIZE WINNER MEETS WITH VP</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting former South African Anglican Church Archbishop Desmond Mpilo Tutu --
the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize winner -- visited the Presidential Office Friday,
where he received a warm welcome from Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Lu informed Tutu of her ongoing campaign for the ruling
party nomination to run in the 2008 presidential election and expressed
confidence that she would win the battle. In return, Tutu gave his blessing
while observing that her male rivals may have to be careful.</P>
      <P>Lu told Tutu, who won the Nobel Prize for his contribution to ending apartheid
in South Africa and facilitating reconciliation, that she was a member of an
international election monitoring group that observed the first fully-demoratic
presidential election in South Africa in 1994.</P>
      <P>During the trip, Lu said she witnessed how ethnic conflicts were settled in
South Africa and how a new country was born in democracy.</P>
      <P>Mentioning Tutu's visit the previous day to a historic site marking the 228
Incident of 1947 -- one of the bloodiest chapters in Taiwan's history -- the
vice president said although the historic wound remains in the heart of local
people, nonetheless they remain tolerant, peace-loving and dedicated to justice.</P>
      <P>During the 1949-1987 period, while the Kuomintang regime imposed martial law,
she and many other democratic activists were jailed for many years. At the time,
no one would have thought that 20 years later,  a defense counsel for eight
defendants  charged  with insurrection before a military court would be inviting
one of those "insurgents, " to stand for the presidential and vice presidential
election and help bring a peaceful,  democratic  end to that authoritarian
regime. Lu was referring to President Chen Shui-bian's invitation of her to team
up for the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Tutu said that during his current visit to the island once called Formosa, he
feels that there is no hatred in the hearts of family members of the 228
Incident victims. He blessed Taiwan's people, wishing them a peaceful and more
harmonious future.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Farmers' Association (TFA) Secretary-General Chang Yung-chen said Friday
that the association is still considering whether or not to form a farmers'
party and has not yet come to a decision.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks after press reports stated that TFA members will unite
with other local farmers' groups to organize their own political party to
protest against politicians'  long-term ignorance of their interests.</P>
      <P>The TFA,  which has some 1.8 million  members,  has been traditionally
supportive of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>According to press reports, TFA members plan to field their own candidates for
the year-end legislative election.</P>
      <P>Responding to the report, Chang said they have not yet decided to form a party,
but are considering whether or not farmers around the country should establish a
profesional party that differs from the traditional political parties by
focusing only on their particular areas of interest, much like the Green Party
in Germany.</P>
      <P>Chang added that if they really do form a party, they will only seek at-large
legislative seats to safeguard the well-being of farmers and will not compete
with the country's major political parties for constituency seats; he went on to
urge the ruling and opposition parties not to panic over their possible moves.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng said the same day that the
KMT should carefully observe the possible developments with regard to the
proposal of farmers forming their own party.</P>
      <P>TFA members are reportedly dissatisfied with KMT lawmakers as they have
neglected agricultural policies and are not actively promoting bills related to
farmers' well-being.</P>
      <P>Noting that TFA's movement may diminish the KMT's odds of victory in upcoming
elections and its popularity among its grass-root supporters, Wang urged the
party's authorities to manage prudently the issue. Wang is a former KMT vice
chairman.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Chairman Wu Po-hsiung said he was not aware of the farmers party
proposal and will seek to become better informed on the point. At the same time,
however, Wu denied that the KMT has not paid much attention to agricultural
affairs.</P>

      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has agreed to allot five constituencies to
be managed by its ally, the People First Party (PFP) , in December's legislative
elections, PFP officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>The preliminary agreement came after a group of PFP lawmakers led by Chang
Hsien-yao, who also serves as director of the party's central policy center,
held talks earlier that day with KMT officials prior to a legislative Procedure
Committee meeting, in which the KMT needed PFP collaboration to block two bills
that are of major concern to it, according to PFP sources.</P>
      <P>During the talks, KMT Secretary-General Wu Duen-yih signed a document agreeing
to allocate five constituencies for the PFP to run in the year-end legislative
elections, the sources said, adding that the two parties will hold more talks in
the coming two weeks on cooperation in the remaining constituencies.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that all this will help avoid a split between the two parties and
secure victory for both parties in future elections, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, the two draft bills submitted by the "pan-green camp" of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU), were rejected by lawmakers of the KMT, the PFP and the Non-Partisan
Solidarity Union in the committee meeting, crushing "pan-green" efforts to send
them to the respective committees for further screening.</P>
      <P>The first DPP-proposed bill sought to ban those who are convicted in the first
trial from taking part in the country's presidential elections and the second,
put forward by the TSU, sought to force the KMT to return its ill-gotten assets
to the national coffers.</P>
      <P>The first is apparently  aimed at former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, a likely and
strong candidate to represent the KMT in the next presidential race despite
embezzlement charges against him.</P>
      <P>Wu admitted that the two parties had reached agreement in some areas with regard
to the coming elections, saying that the KMT is "cautiously optimistic" about
the outcome.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese investment in China reached US$2.08 billion in the first three months
of this year, an increase of 17.79 percent over the year-earlier level,
according to statistics released Friday by the Investment Commission under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>The Investment Commission approved a total of 258 China-bound investment
projects by Taiwanese entrepreneurs during the January-March period.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a total of 466 inbound investment projects by foreign and overseas

during the same period, a decrease of 72.62 percent over the same period of last

      <P>MOEA officials attributed the drop in foreign direct investment partly to the
unusual high amount recorded in the first quarter of last year due to Philips
Taiwan's transfer of its shares in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. to
its mother company.</P>
      <P>If that sale was excluded, foreign direct investment during the first three
months registered a 14.38 percent drop over the same period of last year, the

      <P>The Consumers' Foundation is intervening on behalf of a young woman to seek
compensation from Chinatrust Commercial Bank for the trauma she suffered as a
result of a January mock bank robbery that she believed was real at the time.</P>
      <P>Foundation Chairman Cheng Jen-hung told reporters Friday that the woman, whose
name he declined to disclose, was trying to remit a sum of money at Chinatrust's
Chungshan branch when the bank staged the anti-robbery  exercise without giving
any prior notice to its customers.</P>
      <P>Caught unaware by the exercise, in which a "robber" wielding a gun was right
next to her, the woman -- pale-faced and trembling with fear -- nearly collapsed
and had difficulty breathing when the exercise was over, according to Cheng.</P>
      <P>The woman was hospitalized for 10 days. She is still receiving follow-up
treatment and is unable to work.</P>
      <P>Chinatrust agreed only to pay her medical expenses and offered two gift vouchers
for the Chinatrust Hotel, claiming that the bank was not responsible for the
consequences because it was following the instructions of the Cabinet-level
Financial Supervisory Commission in holding the exercise.</P>
      <P>Cheng said Chinatrust apparently violated the Consumer Protection Law because it
failed to inform its customers in advance of the mock holdup in the first place
and then shirked its responsibility of making appropriate compensation to the
victim.</P>
      <P>The Consumers' Foundation executive pointed out that under the law, the bank
should post a clear sign warning its customers when its products or services

      <P>A recent survey shows that Honghai Precision Industry Co.'s 2006 net revenue --
NT$868.2 billion (US$26.2 billion) -- ranked top among publicly and privately
owned large corporations in Taiwan, a spokesman of the China Credit Information
Service (CCIS) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Quoting the results of the survey conducted by CCIS, the spokesman said the
total revenue of the top 10 corporations in 2006 amounted to NT$5.14 trillion,
making it the best ever year and resulting in an average growth rate for each
corporation of 24.64 percent, higher than the 2005 rate of 14.38 percent.</P>
      <P>The other nine corporations in the top 10 were: the CPC Corp., Taiwan; Cathay

Taipower Co.; AsusTek Computer; Nan Shan Life Insurance Co.; and the Bureau of
National Health Insurance.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, Honghai topped other corporations for the second

      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) has named seven crops -- peanuts, oranges,
papayas, pineapples, garlic, onions and bananas -- as the subjects of the
government's production registration operations this year in an effort to
prevent glut, COA officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>Growers of these crops can declare the scale of their planned production this
year to the COA Agriculture and Food Agency in order to avail themselves of
government compensation if their crops lose their value due to glut on the local
market, the officials said.</P>
      <P>According to the COA, the production registration system was formed as part of
efforts to address the challenging problem of production-marketing imbalances
that always affect farmers the worst.</P>
      <P>The system allows the government to better control the output of "sensitive
crops " -- those which easily trigger price fluctuations in the event of
production-marketing  unbalance  --  and take precautions against over-planting.</P>
      <P>If the efforts to prevent glut fail, the COA will purchase the registered crops
at 95 percent of their production cost in an attempt to reduce the growers'
losses, the COA said, noting that production registration will not ensure
profits but will at least lessen the damage.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's semiconductor industry ranks first in the world in terms of
competitiveness, with no other countries expected to rival it over the next few
years, an official from the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Tu Tze-chen, director of the ITRI's Industrial Economics and Knowledge Center
(IEK), said that the "blue ocean strategy" for Taiwan's semiconductor industry
is aimed at making other countries think twice about challenging Taiwan's pre-
eminent position in this field.</P>
      <P>By 2015, Taiwan will have the greatest number of 12-inch wafer fabs in the
world, Tu predicted, noting that based on current investment proposals brought
up by Taiwan companies, another 27 12-inch wafer fabs are expected to be built
in the country in the coming few years.</P>
      <P>Chien Chi-sheng,  the IEK's research manager on the local semiconductor
manufacturing industry, said that the 12-inch wafer has transformed the global
wafter manufacturing industry. He explained that manufacturing  12-inch wafers
requires advanced production capabilities and that Taiwan has a key advantage in
terms of lowering production costs.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is facing less and less competition abroad in the field, with major
integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) around the world pulling out of advanced
process development and fewer new competitors entering the market, Chien
explained.</P>
      <P>Moreover, most 8-inch wafer fabs around the world will soon be closed down, and
the world's major memory chipmaker, U.S.-based Micron Technology Inc., has begun
to shift its focus away from the DRAM market, Chien said, adding that all these
factors represent a promising future for Taiwan manufacturers.</P>
      <P>According to Chien's estimate, there will be 14 12-inch wafer fabs in Taiwan by
the end of 2008. By 2009, local wafer foundries and 12-inch wafer manufacturers
will be able to increase their monthly production capacity by 387,000 units, he
said, adding that this will further boost the production value of Taiwan's wafer
manufacturing industry by NT$270 billion (US$8.1 billion).</P>
      <P>The output of Taiwan's IC manufacturing industry will surpass NT$1 trillion for
the first time in 2009 and exceed NT$2 trillion in the following year, he
predicted.</P>

Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales, trying to salvage his job, endured
withering questioning on Thursday from Senate Judiciary Committee members who

federal prosecutors.

In more than five hours of often-combative testimony, Mr. Gonzales, grim-faced,
clasping his hands and hunched over, struggled to offer a coherent explanation
for the dismissals. He apologized for his mistakes in what he said was a flawed
process, but defended the removal of eight United States attorneys as proper.

Wall Street Journal:GM's Chinese Partner Looms as a New Rival

Garment company owner Li Xianjin was planning to buy a new Buick this month.
"Then I saw the Roewe," a new Chinese-made sedan, he says. "It's quite a bit
bigger and more luxurious" and "it looks a lot like a Jaguar."

Mr. Li's change of heart points to a challenge for General Motors Corp. in the

Industry Corp., has been GM's partner in making Buicks in China for a decade,
and it has learned a lot from GM. Now the Chinese company, using that know-how
and the money earned from selling joint-venture cars, could become a serious
competitor.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>MILITARY CONCLUDES ROUND-THE-CLOCK SIMULATED WARFARE DRILLS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 21 (CNA)
04/21/07  14:17:19

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's military has concluded a series of simulated cyber warfare maneuvers in
which the various branches of the armed forces conducted mock counterattacks on
China's coastal military targets after a simulated surprise attack by China,
military sources said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The round-the-clock five-day computerized warfare simulation that ended Friday
was part of the annual "Han Kuang" series of combined services military
exercises aimed at honing combat strategies and battlefield management tactics,
the sources said.</P>
      <P>This year's cyber war games also marked the first time that Taiwan's armed
forces have practiced counterattack strategies and skills in simulated warfare
drills, the sources said, adding that in the mock counterattacks,  Taiwan troops
struck coastal Chinese military targets and booming cities with such weapons as
cruise missiles and short-range ballistic missiles.</P>
      <P>The military's Joint Operations Command Center,  the Joint Operations Training
Center, and tactical command offices at various strategic military units took
part in the computerized maneuvers, the sources said, adding that a U.S.
delegation, headed by former Pacific Command Commander-in-Chief Adm. Dennis C.
Blair, was on hand to observe the whole process.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense is scheduled to brief the press on the details
of the "Han Kuang 23" cyber warfare maneuvers at its routine news conference
next Tuesday, the sources said.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, the war game scenario was set in 2012 when China,
frustrated by Taiwan's long-term resistance against unification  talks,  decides
to  take  advantage  of Taiwan's procrastination in military arsenal upgrading
to accelerate its push for cross-strait unification by launching an all-out
surprise attack on Taiwan proper and its outlying island of Penghu.</P>
      <P>In the first three days of the simulated Chinese invasion, Taiwan incurred
severe human and material losses from China's saturated ballistic missile
assault as well as naval and aerial bombardment. Afterwards, Taiwan's armed
forces managed to get up to steam to stage counterattacks on China's coastal
military targets and its major cities, causing heavy human casualties and major
destruction.</P>
      <P>In the warfare scenario, the military strikes not only took a heavy toll on the
economic well-being of both sides of the Taiwan Strait but also adversely
impacted the global economy and caused a worldwide panic. In the end, the United
States and other Western countries jointly mediated a ceasefire.</P>
      <P>The simulated war games didn't cover the use of nuclear weapons or Taiwan
military attacks on China's aircraft carrier battle groups as some media outlets
had speculated, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the sources said, the U.S. observation group focused in particular on
assessing the Taiwan military personnel's "combat spirit" to see whether their
morale has been affected by the prolonged political infighting that has cast a
shadow over society since the transition of power between different political
parties back in 2000.</P>
      <P>In weighing the military's "combat spirit," the sources said, the U.S.
delegation wanted to determine whether Taiwan would likely lean toward China and
whether any advanced U.S.-built weaponry systems or sophisticated defense
strategies would end up in the hands of the Chinese communists.</P>
      <P>Following the completion of the cyber warfare maneuvers, the sources said, the
military will start a five-day psychological warfare training program aimed at
enhancing service members' combat morale, battlefield adaptability and stress
management abilities.</P>
      <P>The "Han Kuang" series is the largest-scale combined services military exercise
to be staged in Taiwan every year. In addition to the computerized war games, it
also covers live-fire military maneuvers, which will be held later this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO BUILD MORE WIND POWER GENERATORS: ECONOMICS MINISTER</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government plans to build wind power generators on the seas surrounding the
island in the near future after it has installed over 100 such facilities on
land as part of its standing efforts to develop renewable energy sources, the
minister of economic affairs said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Steve R. L. Chen revealed the plan at a forum organized by the Chinese-language
Economic Daily News on strategies in the face of the approaching era of high oil
prices. He said that the government has set the target of 10 percent of the
power generated in Taiwan coming from renewable energy sources by the year of
2010.</P>
      <P>At present, only 8 percent of the total amount of power generated in the country
is from renewable energy sources, Chen said, noting there is still a lot of work
to do in this regard.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan has to import 98 percent of the energy it needs, the island must
take precautions against increasing energy prices in the international market
due to the growing energy shortage around the globe, Chen said.</P>
      <P>In this regard, Chen said, the government has never ceased in its efforts to
develop renewable energy sources and has worked out plans that focus on the
development of wind power.</P>
      <P>Addressing the government's efforts in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in
accordance with a worldwide effort to slow down global warming, the minister
said that a draft bill on greenhouse gas emissions reduction has been sent to
the Legislative Yuan for review and that the government will soon finalize a
draft bill on energy taxation, based on the "pay-per-use" principle.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONSTRUCTION OF EXPRESSWAY HINGES ON ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT: PREZ</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 21 (CNA)
04/21/07  17:08:10
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that the construction of an expressway to
connect Suao and Hualien in eastern Taiwan is necessary but that a prerequisite
for its construction  is the project passing  an environmental  impact
assessment.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while addressing the opening of an NGO-sponsored
environmental protection conference in Taipei.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the government's set policy is to establish an islandwide
expressway  network and that the planned Suhua expressway will be a crucial part
of it.</P>
      <P>But he stressed that if the project fails an environmental impact assessment, it
will have to be aborted, saying that "this is the government's unequivocal
stance and the stance of past and present premiers."</P>
      <P>The president's remarks came in the wake of a recent spat among three
presidential contenders of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party -- namely
Premier Su Tseng-chang and his predecessors Frank Hsieh and Yu Shyi-kun -- on
who should shoulder the biggest responsibility for the stalling of the long-
discussed project.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, environmental activists have blasted what they called myopic
politicians for using the expressway project as a pork barrel ploy to win voter
support in elections without being aware of the disastrous impact on eastern
Taiwan's ecology and tourism that the highway's construction would have.</P>
      <P>Construction of the Suhua expressway was one of Chen's campaign promises in the
presidential elections in 2000 and 2004.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that there are already two freeways, an expressway, a railway
and a high speed railway in western Taiwan. The Peiyi (Taipei-Yilan) expressway
has also been inaugurated, making travel from any point in western Taiwan to
Yilan in northeastern Taiwan within one day a reality.</P>
      <P>In comparison, eastern Taiwan has only one major railway system, which has yet
to go electric, Chen said. If the planned Suhua expressway project is aborted,
the imbalance in development between eastern and western Taiwan will be even
more apparent, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen said that construction of the expressway is the will of the people of
Hualien.</P>
      <P>"Although I said previously that if there is conflict between economic
development and environmental protection, I would rather choose the latter, it
will be a stripping of the Hualien people's rights to pursue prosperity if the
government insists on opposing the project even if it is determined that the
impact on the environment will not be that big," the president said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EPA TO SCREEN EXPRESSWAY CONSTRUCTION PROJECT NEXT MONTH</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The  Environmental  Protection Administration (EPA) said Saturday that it will
convene another meeting to screen a controversial expressway construction
project in eastern Taiwan next month at the earliest.</P>
      <P>EPA officials made the remarks after President Chen Shui-bian said earlier the
same day at the opening of an environmental protection conference that
construction of the Suhua expressway linking Suao and Hualien is necessary for
the sake of balanced development of western and eastern Taiwan but that a
prerequisite for its construction is the project passing an environmental impact
assessment.</P>
      <P>The president's remarks drew flak from the representatives of environmental
protection groups taking part in the conference, who vowed to step up lobbying
of the members of a 21-member environmental impact task force in an effort to
stop the project from going forward.</P>
      <P>EPA officials noted that during the first screening meeting in January, 10
members on the environmental impact assessment task force raised questions about
the project's impact on the local ecology, geographic fault, economy and
culture.</P>
      <P>The EPA has therefore asked the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC) to address their misgivings before April 30, the officials said.</P>
      <P>They further said that if the MOTC can provide the necessary details by next
week, the second screening meeting will be held as early as the beginning of
May.</P>
      <P>Chiou Lin-bin, director general of the MOTC's National Expressway Engineering
Bureau, said Saturday that if the Suhua expressway project is aborted, the goal
of establishing an islandwide expressway network will not be able to be
achieved.</P>
      <P>He said that his bureau has envisioned the National Expressway No. 5, which
currently runs between Nankang, Taipei and Suao, Yilan, stretching to cover the
section between Suao and Hualien and then extending to Taitung in the long run.</P>
      <P>He noted that the current railway transportation system in eastern Taiwan can
hardly relieve the traffic congestion on the present Suao-Hualien Highway and
that upgrading the railway system will not solve the problem.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS TRADE BARBS OVER GOOD GOVERNANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 21 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two presidential aspirants of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
traded barbs over what good governance means Saturday in a televised platform
forum.</P>
      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh said that if elected president in the 2008 election,
he will form a stable coalition in view of the current plight of a minority
government.</P>
      <P>Hsieh noted that if the DPP fails to gain control of more than half of the seats
in the legislature, he will coordinate with other parties to form a stable
coalition, although he declined to touch on how to do so, saying it is a
"complex issue." Hsieh later explained that "tolerance" is essential to
achieving the end.</P>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang challenged Hsieh to disclose now how he would end the
political impasse and the perennial squabbling between the ruling and opposition
parties, saying that Hsieh can provide his advice on coordination now without
waiting to 2008 when he is elected president.</P>
      <P>All four DPP hopefuls, including Vice President Annette Lu and DPP Chairman Yu
Shyi-kun, attended the second and last platform forum sponsored by the DPP prior
to the party's presidential primary in May. The forum was held in Chiayi,
southern Taiwan. The first one was held in Taipei last Saturday.</P>
      <P>They concurred that the minority government has been hampered in carrying out
many of its policies, when asked by professor Shih Cheng-feng of Tamkang
University why so many supporters feel that that the DPP has failed to deliver
on its campaign promises after seven years in power and what they are going to
do to ensure happiness for the people if elected president in 2008.</P>
      <P>Hsieh noted that if he is elected, he will form a stable coalition with other
parties and sign with them an agreement to state clearly in which areas they can
cooperate and in which areas they cannot.</P>
      <P>Su said that the interests of the public are the most important, adding that if
economic development and environmental protection cannot co-exist, he would
rather choose the preservation of Taiwan's ecology.</P>
      <P>Lu said that the major problem with the administration lies with a bad
constitutional system.</P>
      <P>Lu noted that after the president appoints the premier, the Executive Yuan
possesses great power, except that of national defense and diplomatic policies.
But she lamented that the premier's term is too short, noting that there have
been five premiers over the past seven years. The five decades of Kuomintang
rule also left a litany of problems, which will require time to solve, she
added.</P>
      <P>Constant bickering in the legislature stemming from the fact that the government
is a minority government has also been a hindrance to implementing and carrying
out policies, Lu said,  adding that globalization is also a challenge.</P>
      <P>She said that  if elected  president,  she will push for constitutional reform
and party politics, make good use of talent in every field, and work in tune
with global trends.</P>
      <P>Yu said that the performance of the DPP has not lived up to the public's
expectations mainly because it is a minority government, adding, however, that
in fact, the DPP has done a credible job, citing the examples of the daunting
tasks of constructing the Shuehshan Tunnel and dredging of the Keelung River.</P>
      <P>He vowed that if elected, he will make Taiwan a "normal country" and "bring
about economic prosperity so that the people will enjoy a high-quality life."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former opposition Koumintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou registered Saturday to
join the party's primary for the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Ma said that if elected president, he will devote himself to creating a "New
Taiwan, " totally different from the one shaped over the past seven years, by
using the power given to the president by the law and constitutional system. He
described his ideal Taiwan as a country that is "liberal, optimistic, open, and
keen on development."</P>
      <P>For the registration, Ma handed over NT$7 million (US$211,300), a sum of money
to serve as primary operation fees, and a name list of 215,168 KMT members who
gave their support for his bid to represent the party in the presidential
election.</P>
      <P>So far, Ma is the only person to register for the KMT primary.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung reiterated his party's sincerity in
carrying out proposals listed in an agreement forged by the KMT and its
political ally, the People First Party (PFP), Friday.</P>
      <P>The agreement came after two weeks of negotiations between the KMT and PFP on
the matter of jointly selecting candidates from the two parties with the best
chances of winning in the year-end legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Wu made the declaration in response to media inquiries at the KMT headquarters
where he witnessed Ma's primary registration.</P>
      <P>Wu said  that KMT Secretary-General  Wu Den-yih  has full authorization to deal
with issues concerning the KMT-PFP cooperation in terms of the upcoming
legislative elections and that the KMT has nothing but sincerity in carrying out
every agreement between the two parties.</P>
      <P>The KMT and the PFP forged alliance relations Jan. 22 and agreed to jointly work
to select candidates who have the best chances of winning seats in the
legislative elections.</P>
      <P>The PFP had earlier expressed doubts about the KMT's willingness to carry out
the January agreement and therefore acted not to cooperate with the KMT during
Monday's legislative session, leading to several draft bills against the KMT,
including one on ill-gotten party assets, being placed on the legislative
agenda.</P>

Wall Street Journal:Land-Swap Plan Causes Trouble For Congressman

As they dig for nickel, copper and other commodities in the far corners of the
earth, the world's largest mining companies, Rio Tinto PLC and BHP Billiton
Ltd., are used to solving geological problems. Here, though, the problems they
encountered were political.

North America's largest copper lode is believed to be buried more than a mile
beneath Apache Leap, the stark red cliffs that loom above this storied Old West
town about an hour east of Phoenix. Resolution Copper Co., a joint venture
between Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton, wants to mine it. But first it needs
Congress to approve a federal land exchange, under which Resolution would swap
5,000 acres of private land for 3,000 acres of public land near its planned
mine.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S.-Taiwan Business Council said Friday that it welcomes Taiwan's approval
for ProMOS Technologies to build an advanced 0.18-micron chip manufacturing
facility in China.</P>
      <P>Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the council which is comprised of a large
network of companies involved in business between Taiwan and the United States,
said that this is "an important and timely decision."</P>
      <P>He said that it is vital that leading Taiwan companies like ProMOS are able to
actively compete and offer their expertise in all markets around the world,
including China's.</P>
      <P>But he also said that "it remains critical for the Taiwan government  to develop
a clear,  consistent  process for such investments, and to finalize and release
new guidelines for the semiconductor industry to replace those that expired in
December 2005."</P>
      <P>He also urged Taiwan's government to remove the 40 percent equity cap on Taiwan
investments in China, saying that "Taiwan does not have the luxury to delay such
efforts while its regional competitors continue to innovate and reform. "</P>
      <P>He contended that present barriers to cross-strait investment are hurting Taiwan
companies, and by extension their U.S. partners, while a liberalized and
transparent cross-strait economic relationship would be beneficial no only for
Taiwan but also for the many partner companies that rely on Taiwan to research,
design, and manufacturer a myriad of goods for consumption in the global market.</P>
      <P>ProMOS Technologies became the second company to be granted approval by the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) since the government allowed Taiwan
semiconductor  manufacturers  to move 0.18-micron chip manufacturing technology
to China in December 2006. The MOEA gave Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
the green light to use 0.18-micron chip manufacturing technology in its factory
in Shanghai last month.</P>

      <P>A 29-year-old Taiwan man will kick off a cross-continent "Bike-To-Protect-Our-
Planet" cycling journey from Beijing Sunday to help raise public awareness of
the need for joint efforts to slow global warming, organizers said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Hsueh Teh-jui said he plans to cycle across Asia and most of Europe to reach
Paris in six months to promote his cause.</P>
      <P>The "Eurasia cycle tour" has been jointly organized by himself and the Taipei-
based Environmental Quality Protection Foundation (EQPF) to inspire more people
to contribute to global efforts to lower greenhouse gas emissions so as to slow
global warming, Hsueh said.</P>
      <P>In June 1901, Hsueh said, five people drove from Beijing to Paris to spread the
message that the age of the automobile has dawned.</P>
      <P>Over the past century, Hsueh said, excessive carbon dioxide emissions from
motorized vehicles has led to drastic climate changes that may threaten the
sustainability of humans and other lviing species.</P>
      <P>"This time around, I want to travel the same route by bicycle to draw attention
to the danger that global warming poses and invite concerted efforts from
members of the general public to improve the situation," Hsueh said.</P>
      <P>Hsueh, who has completed cycling journeys around Taiwan and France over the past
few years, will start his Eurasia cycling tour from Tiantan, a Beijing heritage
site also known as Temple of Heaven, and travel westward along the Silk Road to
reach Kazakhstan via Urumqi, capital of the Chinese province of Xijiang.</P>
      <P>Traveling at a speed of 80 to 120 kilometers per day, Hsueh said he is scheduled
to arrive at Eiffel Tower in Paris Oct. 15 after cycling through Russia,
Ukraine, Poland,  Germany, Holland and Belgium.</P>
      <P>An EQPF spokesman said the foundation throws full support behind Hsueh's Eurasia
concycling journey because they share a common cause of slowing global warming
to protect the natural ecological systems on the Earth.</P>
      <P>Up-to-date information about Hsueh's cycling journey will be posted online at

    <HEADLINE>TSU UNVEILS NEW PARTY CHARTER, PLATFORM</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) came up with new party charter and
new party platform Saturday as part of its survival strategy ahead of the year-
end legislative election that poses a severe test to its political fate or
future.</P>
      <P>The new TSU party platform upholds five basic principles and ideals.  First and
foremost,  the party insists that Taiwan's sovereignty rests with its people and
advocates a Taiwan-centric national development strategy.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the party vows to unite Taiwan's diverse ethnic groups with the
concept that all residents are new-age Taiwanese who treasure freedom, democracy
and human rights as their shared core values.</P>
      <P>The new TSU platform also pledges to promote fair competition on the basis of
social justice while striving to wipe out money-based politics and establishing
a clean and competent government.</P>
      <P>The new TSU charter and platform were unveiled in a Taipei rally that was
attended by former President Lee Teng-hui, who has been reputed as the party's
spiritual leader, and representatives of some social groups.</P>
      <P>Addressing the rally, TSU Chairman Huang Kun-hui said the new party charter and
platform have set forth new policy direction and development guidelines for the
party.</P>
      <P>"With the declaration of our new party charter and platform, we are committed to
working for the common well-being of our country and people," Huang said.</P>
      <P>According to the new TSU charter, Huang went on, the party will pursue a"center-
left" policy line and collaborate with middle-class and disadvantaged groups to
boost welfare services and benefits for them.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Taiwan people's well-being has been compromised due to the
protracted political standoff between the country's two major parties -- the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party and (DPP) and the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) -- in the past seven years, Huang said this situation should not continue
and that the TSU will play a crucial role in pushing for an early end to all
partisan strife and rivalry.</P>
      <P>The TSU now controls 12 legislative seats and several seats in the Taipei City
Council. The party used to be a DPP ally in the Legislative Yuan as both parties
support Taiwan independence and a more confrontational approach toward China.
But their ties have soured over different partisan interests and certain policy
issues, particularly those related with opening to China.</P>
      <P>As the year-end legislative election will adopt a new electoral system that is
generally believed to be less favorable to small parties, the TSU has tried to
foster a new image to woo new fans and has since softened its pro-independence
rhetoric. It now give priority  to talking  about socialism-like  policy
initiatives, particularly welfare services for disadvantaged groups.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSU UNVEILS NEW PARTY CHARTER, PLATFORM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 21 (CNA)
04/22/07  10:42:56
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) came up with new party charter and
new party platform Saturday as part of its survival strategy ahead of the year-
end legislative election that poses a severe test to its political fate or
future.</P>
      <P>The new TSU party platform upholds five basic principles and ideals.  First and
foremost,  the party insists that Taiwan's sovereignty rests with its people and
advocates a Taiwan-centric national development strategy.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the party vows to unite Taiwan's diverse ethnic groups with the
concept that all residents are new-age Taiwanese who treasure freedom, democracy
and human rights as their shared core values.</P>
      <P>The new TSU platform also pledges to promote fair competition on the basis of
social justice while striving to wipe out money-based politics and establishing
a clean and competent government.</P>
      <P>The new TSU charter and platform were unveiled in a Taipei rally that was
attended by former President Lee Teng-hui, who has been reputed as the party's
spiritual leader, and representatives of some social groups.</P>
      <P>Addressing the rally, TSU Chairman Huang Kun-hui said the new party charter and
platform have set forth new policy direction and development guidelines for the
party.</P>
      <P>"With the declaration of our new party charter and platform, we are committed to
working for the common well-being of our country and people," Huang said.</P>
      <P>According to the new TSU charter, Huang went on, the party will pursue a"center-
left" policy line and collaborate with middle-class and disadvantaged groups to
boost welfare services and benefits for them.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Taiwan people's well-being has been compromised due to the
protracted political standoff between the country's two major parties -- the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party and (DPP) and the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) -- in the past seven years, Huang said this situation should not continue
and that the TSU will play a crucial role in pushing for an early end to all
partisan strife and rivalry.</P>
      <P>The TSU now controls 12 legislative seats and several seats in the Taipei City
Council. The party used to be a DPP ally in the Legislative Yuan as both parties
support Taiwan independence and a more confrontational approach toward China.
But their ties have soured over different partisan interests and certain policy
issues, particularly those related with opening to China.</P>
      <P>As the year-end legislative election will adopt a new electoral system that is
generally believed to be less favorable to small parties, the TSU has tried to
foster a new image to woo new fans and has since softened its pro-independence
rhetoric. It now give priority  to talking  about socialism-like  policy
initiatives, particularly welfare services for disadvantaged groups.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese expatriates living in Italy resolved Saturday to support Taiwan's bid
to join the World Health Organization (WHO) as a full member under the name
"Taiwan."</P>
      <P>At a colloquium hosted by Wu Hsiu-chi, president of the Taiwan Chamber of
Commerce in Italy, the expatriates decided that they will write joint letters to
WHO Director-General Margaret Chan and Italy's foreign and health ministries to
ask the new WHO chief and Italian authorities to consider Taiwan's appeal and
support its bid.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the gathering, Cheng Hsin, Taiwan's representative in Italy,
stressed that medical care knows no borders and that global disease prevention
networks should be seamless.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that based on the WHO's mission to protect the health of all the
peoples around the world, Taiwan has every right to apply to join the WHO as a
full member.</P>
      <P>He said all 23 million people in Taiwan are entitled to good medical care, as
are other peoples around the world, and the last thing that the Taiwanese people
would like to see is that Taiwan causes a "rift" in the global disease
prevention networks.</P>
      <P>Cheng added that due to China's obstruction each of Taiwan's attempts to join
the World Health Assembly (WHA) , the WHO's decision-making body, even as an
observer, have failed over the past 10 years.</P>
      <P>He called for Taiwanese people at home and abroad, as well as friends of Taiwan,
to work together to realize the goal of Taiwan's accession to the WHO as a full
member under the name of "Taiwan" at the earliest possible day.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Chang-fa, head of Italian operations of the European Federation
of Taiwan Health Alliance, said that he has traveled to the WHO headquarters in
Geneva every year since 2000 to voice support for Taiwan's bid to join the world
health regulatory body, and has also observed great pressure applied by Beijing
in its determination in barring Taiwan from joining the WHO.</P>
      <P>Chen said greater efforts are needed to make the international community aware
of the injustice of Taiwan's being excluded from the WHO, and the imperative of
integrating the island into the world health system.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the colloquium, Chen Tai-ming, an economics professor of
postgraduate classes in Rome, called on China -- which claims to have "risen
peacefully" onto the world stage -- to act like a great nation with magnanimity.</P>
      <P>As a "great nation, " China should treat its neighbors well, particularly
Taiwan, which is like a brother of China's, said Chen Tai-ming.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's bid to join the WHO as a full member under the name "Taiwan"
may appear unrealistic at the moment, but people should be unrelenting, pointing
out that so long as they struggle, they exist; and so long as they exist, they
have strength.</P>
      <P>He added that he is confident that Taiwan -- a world-class economic powerhouse
with good medical care a compassionate population -- will eventually succeed in
its bid.</P>

      <P>Tutu, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984, accompanied by his wife, headed
to Sandimen Saturday for an introduction to aboriginal Paiwan culture after
concluding a tour of Meinung Township in Kaohsiung County earlier the same day.</P>
      <P>The couple called on a workshop to experience the art of glass bead making and
take a close look at various glass bead exhibits.</P>
      <P>During their stay, workshop chief Shih Hsiu-chu briefed the visitors on the
significance of glass beads in Paiwan tribal culture, while the couple also
expressed their admiration for the tribal people's achievements integrating
traditional aboriginal culture into the modern economy and even reaching markets
overseas.</P>
      <P>Tutu and his wife were so pleased by the splendid glass beads that they
purchased several pieces of glass bead necklaces and bangles at the store.</P>
      <P>In a goodwill gesture, Tutu presented a Swaziland necklace to Shih as a
souvenir, while Shih also offered a glass bead necklace in return.</P>
      <P>Tutu said that he has greatly enjoyed his current visit to Taiwan and feels that

    <HEADLINE>MAC CLARIFIES STANCE ON OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) spokesman reiterated Saturday the council's
stance on the 2008 Olympic torch relay and denied having said that the torch, if
were to pass through Taiwan, should "arrive" and "depart" from different
locations.</P>
      <P>In a statement carried on the British Broadcasting Corp's (BBC) Chinese-language
website Saturday, Liu Te-hsun said he did not say during a news conference held
April 20 that the Olympic torch relay must pass one place beyond Hong Kong or
Macau to enter Taiwan and depart from Taiwan via another place also other than
Hong Kong and Macau.</P>
      <P>Liu said in the BBC online report that he was recently "misquoted" by a Chinese
website, which claimed that Liu had spelled out "four major conditions" for the
2008 Olympic torch passing through Taiwan, including that the torch shall not
pass through Hong Kong or Macau on its way to and from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liu said he made known at last Friday's news conference the four "requests" of
the MAC regarding the notion about the 2008 Olympic torch relay passing through
Taiwan, and adding that the four "requests" were just requests and they should
not be interpreted as "conditions."</P>
      <P>He reiterated the four requests: the torch must be handled following the
protocol of the International Olympic Committee; China must seek Taiwan's
permission to have the 2008 Olympic torch relay pass through Taiwan; China must
guarantee that Taiwan's sovereignty will not be belittled or compromised; and
the torch relay event should be a move conducive to constructive interactions
between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Explaining the third request, that Taiwan's sovereignty not be belittled or
compromised, Liu said that Taiwan belongs to the International Olympic Committee
as an independent sports entity and has for years taken part in Olympic
competitions under the title of "Chinese Taipei."</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he argued, China has stubbornly insisted on calling Taiwan "China
Taipei" -- a title that is unacceptable to Taiwan and its athletes.</P>
      <P>Liu called for China to once again to address Taiwan with the title that has
been traditionally used by the IOC.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liu stressed that as a full IOC member, Taiwan would be proud to be
part of the 2008 Olympic torch relay and will cooperate with the IOC in this
regard in accordance with IOC traditions and formalities.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's Chief of Staff Chiou I-jen expressed April 17 that
Taiwan will definitely not accept a plan that the 2008 Olympic torch relay pass
through Hong Kong or Xiamen in Fujian Province on its way to and from Taiwan,
saying that the plan would belittle Taiwan by implying that it is a province of
China.</P>
      <P>Chiou added, nevertheless, that it would be acceptable to Taiwan if the torch
passes a third country before it reaches Taiwan, including Taiwan in an
international route, instead of a "domestic" route.</P>
      <P>The IOC is in the midst of a 10-day meeting in Beijing, which began April 16,
and the torch relay matter is expected to be one of the hottest issues under
discussion.</P>
      <P>The 2008 Olympic Games are scheduled to be held in Beijing Aug. 8-24.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The People First Party (PFP) was low keyed Sunday about an agreement reached
late last week with the main opposition  Kuomintang  (KMT)  regarding
cooperation  in coming elections, but called for bilateral talks on the issue as
soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Chang Hsien-yao, a PFP lawmaker and director of the party's central policy
center, opined that the two parties should first discuss how to coordinate on
regional-seat candidacies in December's legislative election two weeks before
holding negotiations on further cooperation or a merger -- as was laid out in a
pledge that he inked with KMT Secretary-General Wu Duen-yih last Friday.</P>
      <P>PFP lawmaker Daniel Hwang Yih-jiau, who also serves as executive director of the
party's central policy center, said that the PFP will not rule out the
possibility of stepping up cooperation in any form or merging with the KMT.</P>
      <P>"No terms or conditions have been fixed or settled with regard to future
collaboration between the two parties, " Hwang said and called for two-way talks
on the issue as quickly as possible so as to lay a solid foundation for victory
in December's legislative election and the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>However, both Chang and Hwang were reserved about whether or not all the PFP
lawmakers will definitely take part in the next Procedure Committee Tuesday to
help the KMT block two draft bills of major concern to it as last Friday.</P>
      <P>PFP lawmaker Liu Wen-hsiung, who has registered to take part in the May 12 by-
election for Keelung mayor, urged the KMT to display greater sincerity on
bilateral negotiations, ranging from the Keelung mayoral by-election to the
year-end legislative election.</P>
      <P>"Trying to do away with the PFP will do no good to the KMT, "Liu warned.</P>
      <P>PFP lawmakers and their peers from the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union attended
Friday's committee meeting to help kill the two bills, after Chang and Wu signed
the agreement earlier that day, crushing efforts by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), to ram
through the two bills for a second reading.</P>
      <P>The first bill, initiated by the DPP, is widely believed to take aim at former
KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, who continues to pursue his presidential bid despite
corruption charges against him. The bill would ban individuals convicted in the
first trial from running in presidential elections, while the second proposed by
the TSU seeks to force the KMT return its "ill-gotten" assets to the nation's
coffers.</P>
      <P>Ten PFP lawmakers showed up in the Friday Procedure Committee meeting and cast
"no" votes against the two bills after Chang and Wu signed a 7-point pledge
early that same day, agreeing to jointly field the most electable candidates  in
December's legislative elections, based on a framework established by the two
parties on Jan. 22, when they decided to create a closer alliance to reinforce
collaboration.</P>
      <P>According  to PFP sources,  the KMT agreed to allot five constituencies for the
PFP to manage in the coming legislative election, while negotiations on
cooperation in the rest of the constituencies must be wrapped up within two
weeks.</P>
      <P>Although the signing of the pledge has temporarily defused tensions between the
two parties with regard to the legislative election, observers said that it will
take more time to judge whether the two parties have effectively come to a cease
fire.</P>
      <P>It is extremely difficult to forge across-the-board collaboration between the
two parties due to a lack of mutual trust and a conflict of partisan interests,
observers said.</P>
      <P>According to KMT sources, the eventual goal of the KMT is to secure a majority
of the legislature so as to secure Ma's win in the 2008 presidential race, while
the PFP is focusing its efforts on bailing out the political careers of PFP
lawmakers.</P>
      <P>The signing of the 7-point pledge just marked the very beginning of afierce
challenge for both parties, the KMT source said.</P>

      <P>Tutu, the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize winner, recognized for his contribution to

      <P>The number of wind turbines along Taiwan's west coast now surpasses 100, and the
renewable energy generated by these units is sufficient to prevent the emission

      <P>At a ceremony held in the Changhua Coastal Industrial Park to promote the use of
wind power, officials from the Bureau of Energy under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs said the 103 giant wind turbines located in 13 wind farms along Taiwan's
west coast can generate 420 million kilowatt-hours of electricity a year --
enough to power 105,000 households.</P>

capacity of 500 megawatts. Each unit will cost at least NT$100 million.</P>
      <P>They said Taiwan's coastal areas are ideal for the development of wind power
because they have six months of strong northwest winds each year, with an
average wind speed of five to six meters per second.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Energy has set the target of generating enough renewable energy to
meet 10 percent of Taiwan's electricity needs by 2010, with wind power making up
80 percent of the renewable energy.</P>
      <P>Taipower, the sole electricity supplier in Taiwan, began to harness wind energy
in 2002 and plans to establish 200 wind turbines in Taiwan and Penghu by 2010.</P>
      <P>Taipower's long-term wind power development plant will build an additional 546
wind turbines between 2010 and 2020 in shallow waters off Taiwan's west coast
and Penghu, with a total capacity of 1,980 megawatts at an estimated cost of
NT$200 million each.</P>
      <P>Out of the 546 windmills, 176 will be built off Penghu, and the electricity
generated by these units will be transmitted to Taiwan through a 40-km undersea
cable.</P>
      <P>The other 370 units will be established 10 to 15 km off the coast of Changhua
and Yunlin counties, according to Taipower.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP PRIMARY SYSTEM 'UNFAVORABLE' TO REFORMISTS: FORMER LAWMAKER</HEADLINE>

      <P>Opinion polls conducted under the current system of the ruling Democratic Party
(DPP) to determine nominees for 2007  year-end  legislative  elections  are
"unfavorable"  to reform-minded candidates, a former DPP lawmaker said Sunday.</P>
      <P>At a ceremony marking the formal establishment of his campaign office, Lin Cho-
shui, who resigned as legislator in November last year to protest the DPP's
handling  of a corruption  scandal implicating President Chen Shui-bian and his
wife, said he hopes he can win an extra legislative seat for the DPP by
competing in Taipei's No. 1 electoral district.</P>
      <P>Lin claimed,  however,  that the DPP's primary  system is unfavorable to him and
other reformists.</P>
      <P>He expressed fear that the DPP might win only one seat in all the electoral
districts in the city of Taipei.</P>
      <P>Lin is a former member of the disbanded New Tide Faction within the DPP.</P>
      <P>New Tide members  were known for their  outspokenness  in criticizing DPP
policies and actions and voicing alternatives.</P>
      <P>Other former  members  of the New Tide Faction, including Legislator Hung Chi-
chang and former DPP Legislator Tuan Yi-kang, were on hand to extend their
congratulations.</P>
      <P>Tuan, former chief convener of New Tide, told reporters that the DPP's primary
system is "seriously flawed" and that nominees selected under such a system
would face considerable difficulties in the legislative election.</P>
      <P>Nominations of candidates during the DPP's primary hinge to a large degree on
opinion polls to determine the approval ratings of the candidates. The poll
results account for 70 percent in the final calculation of candidate ratings.</P>
      <P>The DPP's Central Standing Committee has decided to exclude 50 percent of voters
and survey the opinion of only those who have voted for candidates of the DPP
and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, in the last three elections.</P>

      <P>Medical representatives proposed Sunday that district community hospitals should
transform into senior care centers in response to the advent of an aging
society, thereby solving many problems associated with challenges to hospitals'
survival in the face of shrinking market share.</P>
      <P>The current environment favors the development of large hospitals and physician
clinics, making medium and small hospitals less competitive,  said
representatives at a symposium organized by National Health Research Institutes
and Cardinal Tien Hospital Yung Ho branch.</P>
      <P>Such hospitals have been left with no option but to increase their utilization
to generate additional income, the representatives said, adding that while the
proportion of Taiwan's aged population has soared significantly and now accounts
for 10 percent of the total population, it is estimated in 20 years one out five
citizens will be a senior; that rapidly aging population is expected to
stimulate the demand for elder care services.</P>
      <P>A veteran health care professional said that the elderly tend to have chronic
illnesses, such as high blood pressure, stoke, diabetes, cataract, osteoporosis
and dementia, and that the older adults often have multiple chronic diseases for
which they require a variety of medications and treatments.</P>
      <P>She added that on average each older person takes four types of medications
daily, with others taking as many as six types of medication. Although there are
261 sick beds provided by nursing homes for every 10,000 seniors, only 197 beds
have been used on average because most of the aged wish to stay home in the
company of their families.</P>
      <P>A representative devoted in senior health care research said that senior care
services offered in advanced countries feature integrated local medical
treatments, and in-home care and social resources.</P>
      <P>Under the sponsorship of the Department of Health, a total of 16 hospitals
around the country have launched projects aimed at providing integrated senior
health care services, including Chiayi Christian Hospital and Cardinal Tien
Hospital Yung Ho branch.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASPIRANT PUTS FORTH ALTERNATIVE PLAN ON EASTERN TAIWAN DEVELOPMENT</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A presidential aspirant of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party suggested
Sunday that the country seek to follow a "Taiwan Piloting Plan" to develop
eastern Taiwan should the controversial  freeway connecting Suao and Hualien not
be constructed due to environmental considerations.</P>
      <P>Frank Hsieh, who had served as premier and Kaohsiung mayor, said he agrees with
President Chen Shui-bian that it is essential that the Suhua freeway be built
provided that it passes environmental analysis review.</P>
      <P>Chen said the day before that it was an established government policy that a
round-the-island freeway be built, and that it was essential to build a freeway
connecting Suao in the eastern county of Yilan with its neighboring county of
Hualien. "However, we cannot go ahead with the project if it fails the
environmental review, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on that, Hsieh said that he has been aware since he was the premier a
couple of years ago that the Suhua freeway development project is unlikely to
pass the environmental analysis review.</P>
      <P>Consequently, Hsieh said, he has been promoting the alternative "Taiwan Piloting
Plan", which exclusively aims at developing eastern Taiwan where counties  are
characterized  by relatively  small populations in which the natural environment
and agriculture are the most valuable assets.</P>
      <P>Hsieh envisaged funds being raised and stakeholders consulted under the "Taiwan
Piloting Plan", so that signature industries and products with local features
might be developed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Stanley Yen, chairman of the Ritz Landis hotel group, who is also an
environmentalist, said during an event held in Taipei to mark the April 22 Earth
Day, that the Suhua freeway development issue is an ethical issue, rather than a
political issue.</P>
      <P>Yen, who was instrumental in arranging for a visit to eastern Taiwan in March by
the management of the top-flight Burj Al Arab Hotel on a business inspection
tour, urged politicians to display greater ethical conscience, saying that if
Taiwan's people want to be world citizens, they should first learn to be
citizens of the Earth and try harder to protect the global environment.</P>
      <P>Taking the Beiyi freeway connecting Taipei and Yilan as an example, Yen said
that the construction of the Hsuehshan Tunnel, which is part of the Beiyi
freeway, left Taiwan's invaluable, millennia-old water resources damaged and the
proposed Suhau freeway will intrude into 17 biological sensitive zones. The
Beiyi freeway was opened to public traffic last year amid ongoing doubts and
disputes over environmental issues.</P>
      <P>Yen invited Alwin Zecha, the younger brother of the owner of the seven-star Burj
Al Arab Hotel and two-term chairman of the Pacific Asia Travel Association, to
visit the eastern county of Taitung. News reports stated that the hotelier from
Dubai was initially interested in turning a Taitung hot spring hotel into a new
attraction, taking advantage of the natural beauty and white sand of the quiet
city by the Pacific Ocean.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, SINGAPORE SAID AT ODDS OVER ENVOY SELECTION</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore and Taiwan are at odds over each other's diplomatic personnel
selection, informed sources said over the weekend.</P>
      <P>According to these sources, Singapore has rejected Taiwan's offer to have the
former chief of the General Staff serve as its new representative to the city-
state on the excuse that "his status is too sensitive."</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the sources went on, Singapore proposed assigning a low-
echelon official to be its top liaison officer in Taiwan, an offer Taiwan has
ruled out.</P>
      <P>Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has so far made no comment on all those
reports, while Taiwan's Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Chien-yeh has also
refrained from responding to any inquiries about relevant personnel replacement
speculation.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's representative to Singapore, Hu Wei-jen, will soon serve out the
remainder of a second and final term of office, and Singapore is also planning
to reshuffle the lineup of its mission in Taipei, the sources said the two
countries had discussed the issue earlier this year.</P>
      <P>According  to sources,  President Chen Shui-bian once told Singapore
representative Ker Sin Tze that his administration planned to appoint Lee Tien-
yu, a former chief of the General Staff to succeed Hu as Taiwan's representative
to Singapore.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan and Singapore have long cooperated in military affairs, Ker was
reportedly positive on the replacement proposal and conveyed the message to his
home country.</P>
      <P>However, the sources said, processing for the planned personnel reshuffle was
suspended after Singapore's Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew publicly criticized
President Chen last month over his "Four Wants, One Without" doctrine that Lee
thought could provoke China with its pro-independence rhetoric. Relations
between Taiwan and Singapore have since plunged to a new low, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Early this month, sources say, the Singapore Foreign Ministry informed Taiwan
through a formal channel of its refusal to accept Lee as Taiwan's new envoy to
the city-state, which is why Taiwan's Presidential Office made no mention of
Hu's replacement in its recent announcement of Hu's transfer to a new post at
home.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, sources say, Singapore has informed Taiwan of its plan to assign
Stanley Loh, a press secretary of former Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong, as its new representative to Taiwan, and would prefer to make the
personnel changeover in July.</P>
      <P>In Singapore's personnel hierarchy, Loh's ranking is equivalent to that of a
deputy division chief. Unhappy with Singapore's arrangement, sources say Taipei
has politely let Singapore know of its disapproval with Loh's appointment.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties, Taipei and Singapore have tended
to maintain friendly and stable relations, with each side traditionally posting
a political heavyweight to the other's territory to facilitate communications.
However, the rapport between the two countries has come under strain in recent
years partly because they do not see eye-to-eye on approaches toward China.</P>
      <P>While  Singapore  is critical  of Taiwan's  resistance  to reconciliation with
China at the expense of its sovereign status, Taiwan  is  dismissive  of
Singapore's  attempts  to harmonize its cross-Taiwan Strait policy with China.</P>

      <P>Three traditional dance and percussion troupes will depart Taiwan Wednesday for
a 35-city performance tour in the United States and Canada as part of the
country's cultural diplomacy drive, government sources said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The troupes will represent Taiwan during the "Asian Pacific American Heritage
Month" in the United States, a celebration of Asians and Pacific islanders and
their cultures, said Chang Fu-mei, chairwoman of the Overseas Compatriot Affairs
Commission (OCAC).</P>
      <P>Former U.S. President George H.W. Bush designated May as Asian Pacific American
Heritage Month in 1990 and his successor Bill Clinton designated the second week
in May as the Taiwanese American Heritage Week in 1999. Clinton did so after
lobbying by the Formosan Association for Public Affairs, a Washington-based
group dedicated to promoting Taiwan's cause.</P>
      <P>The three troupes -- the Jyou Tian Folk Drumming and Arts Group, the Hongsheng
Lion Dance Troupe and the Honwa Folk Dance Troupe -- will present acrobatic
dragon and lion dances, drum performances and Taiwanese martial arts
demonstrations, Chang said.</P>
      <P>"The troupes, composed mostly of young people, will give 35 performances in
major cities across the U.S. and Canada to offer a look at Taiwan's culture and
folk arts," Chang explained.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Yang Tzu-pao said the troupes'
performance tour is the work of cultural diplomacy, a valuable vehicle to
showcase Taiwan's spirit, folk culture and customs, and upgrade its
international profile and image.</P>
      <P>Praising the troupe members as cultural ambassadors, Yang said they are getting
Taiwan's name out there. He further said the United States is an ideal place to
embark on cultural diplomacy since its administration has designated the second
week in May as an official celebration of Taiwan, giving Taiwan a unique
opportunity to boost cultural ties with the U.S.</P>
      <P>According to OCAC Chairwoman Chang, some members of the troupes come from
troubled backgrounds, even being placed in juvenile reformatory schools. The
OCAC works with them closely, and all are in night school in addition to
rehearsing dance and drumming routines by day, Chang said, adding that these
individuals have successfully transformed themselves.</P>
      <P>A number of government agencies, including the OCAC, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, the Ministry of Education, the Government Information Office and the
National Youth Commission, will jointly finance the troupes' North America tour.</P>

For decades, Mississippi and neighboring states with large black populations and
expanses of enduring poverty made steady progress in reducing infant death. But,
in what health experts call an ominous portent, progress has stalled and in
recent years the death rate has risen in Mississippi and several other states.

The setbacks have raised questions about the impact of cuts in welfare and
Medicaid and of poor access to doctors, and, many doctors say, the growing
epidemics of obesity, diabetes and hypertension among potential mothers, some of
whom tip the scales here at 300 to 400 pounds.</TEXT>

      <P>The National Youth Commission (NYC) will hold a series of training courses for
prospective female entrepreneurs around the country beginning in May to help
women set up their own business, a NYC official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The NYC started up the innovative program to provide women with entrepreneurial
guidance in 2000, and over the past seven years the program has attracted 14,000
participants, the official said.</P>
      <P>The official added that the program has so far borne fruit in many respects,
including providing leadership among government agencies and pushing other
agencies to attach greater importance to female entrepreneurs.</P>
      <P>For example, following the NYC lead, the Ministry of Labor Affairs initiated the
Micro-business Start-up Loan program this year, officials pointed out.</P>
      <P>The official quoted a survey conducted by the NYC stating that 90 percent of
office ladies said they are interested in starting a business, while only 30
percent of those applying for business start-up loans for young entrepreneurs
were women, showing that women were more conservative in dealing with personal
finances.</P>
      <P>Other figures showed that a total of 390,000 enterprises in Taiwan were headed
by women, accounting for 34 percent of the total, while the revenue streams of
these companies comprised only 13 percent of the total, the official said,
adding that there is still ample room for growth in terms of female business
start-up.</P>
      <P>The NYC programs are characterized  by offering  the best guidelines for
business practices, and for launching many activities for women in the business
sector, including training in writing operating proposals, applying for loans,
marketing products, as well as offering consultation and enterprises diagnostic
services.</P>
      <P>The courses are slated to open May 5, and with the auspices of the NYC, those
interested in participating are required to pay only a NT$1,000 enrollment fee,
the official said, adding that further information is available on their Web

    <HEADLINE>TRADE, TEACHERS' GROUPS CALL FOR MINIMUM WAGE HIKE ASAP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  23 (CNA)
04/23/07  13:46:08

    <TEXT>
      <P>Trade and teachers' groups urged the government Monday to raise the country's
minimum wage, which has been frozen at the same level for a decade, immediately
to make it more commensurate with Taiwan's general economic situation and
consumer price index.</P>
      <P>At a news conference held in the leadup to International Labor Day on May 1,
representatives of the Taiwan Confederation of Trade Union (TCTU) and National
Teachers' Association (NTA) demanded that the government raise the minimum wage
immediately to show that the government is concerned about the "survival rights"
of lower-echelon workers.</P>
      <P>TCTU Chairman Shih Chao-hsien said that over the past several years, enormous
amounts of Taiwan capital has flowed overseas at a tremendous pace as a result
of a "specious" government policy of financial liberalization.  The outflow of
capital has in turn compromised domestic workers' rights and interests, he
claimed.</P>
      <P>Shih added that the country's minimum wage, which has remained at NT$15,840
(US$480) per month, or NT$66 per hour, for 10 years, is not commensurate with
current economic realities,  including rising inflation. This is a development
that has prevented low-level workers from maintaining "a living with dignity" or
even securing their basic "rights to survival," he said.</P>
      <P>NTA Chairman Wu Chung-tai said that many parents have taken on extra jobs just
to try to make ends meet, adding that this moonlighting has had an impact on
parent-child relations.</P>
      <P>The representatives  also called for the administration to institutionalize
regular adjustments of the minimum wage and to convene a meeting at least once a
year in this regard to keep the minimum wage fully commensurate with the actual
economic and social situations. They also resolved that TCTU and NTA members
will rally on Labor Day and invite six presidential aspirants from the ruling
and opposition parties to make known their resolutions and ideals about the
country's labor policy.</P>
      <P>Lee Ying-yuan, Taiwan's top official in charge of labor affairs, said earlier
this month that the minimum wage will be adjusted in the second half of this
year, probably July 1, although the exact timing for the implementation can be
readily changed based on practical considerations.</P>
      <P>As to the adjustment range, Lee said, a combination of factors, including the
increase in the average consumer price index over the past decade, Taiwan's
general economic growth as well as the possible adverse impact on local
industries' competitiveness, should be taken into consideration when deciding on
the level of the minimum wage increase.</P>
      <P>While the business community has declared that 5 percent is the maximum level
they are willing to accept for an upward adjustment, labor groups want a far
larger hike, Lee said, adding that he once proposed at a Legislative Yuan
session that the minimum wage be raised to 40 percent of the average salary of
all workers in the country. If adopted, the minimum wage would be increased to
NT$17,600 per month, representing a hike of 11 percent over the current level.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A national land restoration plan put forward recently by the Executive Yuan is
expected to have an impact on some domestic industries, particularly the cement
processing industry, a Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The plan -- formulated in line with a national land restoration draft bill,
which is pending in the legislature -- stipulates that public land in high
elevation areas or areas zoned for restoration should not be leased out to
private companies for business usage.</P>
      <P>Chen Tai-hsiung, a deputy director of the MOEA Bureau of Mines, said that the
land restoration plan is seen to have an adverse impact on the cement,  iron and
steel,  and petrochemical processing industries. He added that if the plan is
implemented, Taiwan's cement and marble processing industries will be the first
to be affected, with many plants in these sectors being forced to close down due
to a dearth of raw materials.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan Cement Corp., one of the country's major cement producers,
does not expect the national land restoration plan to have any immediate impact
on its business operations.</P>
      <P>A corporate source said that Taiwan Cement has taken out leases on three mine
areas around the island for the extraction of hard rocks or softer rocks for the
production of cement. The leases don't expire until 2017.</P>
      <P>In addition, the source said, according to Taiwan Cement's new extraction
contracts with the government, only three percent of the land in the leased rock
mining areas is at an elevation of higher than 1,000 meters.</P>
      <P>The source  added  that  Taiwan  Cement  has always  been environmentally-
conscious and has helped green the mining areas while excavating raw materials.</P>

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Monday that if there is
evidence to support vote buying allegations in the party's upcoming legislative
primary, the party will deal with them harshly.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung made the remarks amid reports that the
approval ratings for 19 legislative aspirants vying for the at-large seats are
close and that the competition is fierce. They will be ensured a berth in the
year-end streamlined legislature if they can garner 20,000 votes in the member
vote May 6. As such, rumors have it that one ballot is selling for NT$3,000
(US$90.9).</P>
      <P>Lin noted that the party has a task force charged with cracking down on vote-
buying and that it is probing the rumors, but he also urged the media and the
aspirants to refrain from "insinuations" and "exaggerating" election corruption.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP Legislator Yu Cheng-dao urged the party to get to the bottom of
the vote-buying rumors, while his colleague Gao Jyh-peng said that if there are
no cash rewards or interference by the government, it will be difficult for the
party alone to track down vote-buying.</P>
      <P>The new legislature will be elected through a "single-seat constituency, two
ballots" system instead of the existing "single vote, multiple-seat
constituency" system. Voters will cast two ballots, one for the constituency and
another for their favored political party.</P>
      <P>The 225-seat legislature will also be halved to 113 members, with 73 seats
elected from regional districts, six seats for aboriginal representatives and 34
seats for at-large and overseas expatriate representatives.</P>
      <P>The regional seats will be distributed  among the special municipalities,
counties and cities according to their populations, with each locality enjoying
at least one seat and one legislator elected from each district. The at-large
and overseas expatriate seats will be allocated to political parties that win at
least 5 percent of the votes cast, according to the proportion of votes they
garner.</P>

that an article of the existing Nationality Law could provide a fast track for
foreign nationals to become Republic of China citizens.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Wang Hsin-nan was basing his concern on Item I of Article Three
of the Nationality Law, which he said stipulates that foreigners or non-ROC
citizens who stay over 183 days per year in Taiwan for five consecutive years
are allowed to apply for Republic of China citizenship.</P>
      <P>This item, he claimed, might open a convenient door to foreign nationals,

stay in Taiwan for up to six years per contract in accordance with a newly

      <P>A lawmaker of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) challenged the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Monday to come up with evidence to substantiate its
claims that the DPP presidential hopefuls are "buying" TV news reports.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Wang Tuoh, secretary of the DPP Legislative Caucus, said lies cannot be
turned into truth by simply repeating them and that the KMT, which claims three
of the four DPP presidential aspirants have offered money to local TV channels
in exchange for news coverage of their election campaign, should verify their
accusation with evidence or keep quite.</P>
      <P>Noting that the source of the accusation was accredited to Yang Tu, director of
the KMT's Cultural and Communications Committee, Wang said Yang is the last
person who should make the accusation because he himself was financed by Ma
Ying-jeou to film a documentary of the 228 Incident about a revolt by the
Taiwanese against the KMT regime in 1947, with the purpose of whitewashing KMT's
role in the incident.</P>
      <P>The film was shot in 2004 when Ma served as mayor of Taipei and before Yang was
named the chief of the cultural committee.</P>
      <P>Yang was quoted by Monday's United Daily News as saying that among the DPP
presidential hopefuls -- Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su Cheng-chang,
former Premier Frank Hsieh and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun -- all except Lu have
bought TV news coverage through proxies.</P>
      <P>Yang condemned the three DPP hopefuls for infringing on the ethics of journalism
and perhaps breaching the law regulating political donations.</P>
      <P>The paper also quoted Ba Jien, a manager of the Formosa Television Company Ltd.
as saying that politicians are likely to ask for more news coverage while
placing their political TV commercials, and that his station is willing to offer
KMT politicians the same treatment if they buy commercials from Formosa TV.</P>
      <P>Based on Yang's claims, KMT lawmaker Ting Shou-chung asked the National
Communications Commission Monday to stem the placement of TV advertisements
featuring politicians during the election campaign period.</P>

program for 40 years will be entitled to a monthly pension of NT$7,603 (US$229).</P>
      <P>Lin said it has so far not yet come to a final decision in terms of the pension
amount, nor the date for beginning the program's operation.</P>
      <P>Also at the Legislative Yuan, Executive Yuan spokeswoman Chen Mei-ling explained
that after receiving the bill from the MOI April 12, the Executive Yuan
commissioned Minister without Portfolio Lin Wan-yi to form a task force to
review the bill.</P>
      <P>The draft bill is expected to be delivered to the Cabinet plenary meeting for
certification by May 2, Chen said, adding that the MOI will not file detailed
reports on how it will enact the national pension act or when it will begin to
operate the pension program until the bill is certified.</P>
      <P>This bill proposes that anyone aged 25 to 64 not covered by any form of social
insurance be included in the national pension program.</P>
      <P>Forty percent of the monthly premium will be paid by the government. For the
handicapped, the government subsidy will increase in accordance with the degree
of disability. Low-income families will be exempt from the premium, according to
the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chen also noted that the Executive Yuan is opposed to any proposals by lawmakers
to raise the amount of any of the existing stipend programs before the long-

    <HEADLINE>EU-TAIWAN TRADE LAST YEAR RECORDS 6.8% GROWTH IN TAIWAN'S FAVOR</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Bilateral trade between Taiwan and the European Union (EU) increased 6.8 percent
to 39.4 billion euros (US$53.4 billion) last year, making Taiwan the EU's 14th-
largest trading partner worldwide, according to figures released Monday by the
European Economic and Trade Office in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In its EU Newsletter for April, the office quoted figures by Eurostat, the EU's
statistics office, as showing that Taiwanese exports to the EU for 2006 recorded
a growth of 9.7 percent, reaching 26 billion euros.</P>
      <P>In contrast, EU exports to Taiwan, valued at 13 billion euros, were far less
dynamic, representing growth of only 1.5 percent and leaving a deficit of 13
billion euros for the EU -- almost 20 percent larger than in 2005.</P>
      <P>In 2006, Taiwan was the EU's 10th-largest supplier of goods and its 23rd-biggest
customer.</P>
      <P>Compared with 2005, Taiwan fell four notches last year to become the EU's 14th-
largest trading partner worldwide. In Asia, Taiwan was the EU's fifth-largest
trading partner, behind China, Japan, South Korea and India.</P>
      <P>In 2005, Taiwan was the EU's fourth-largest partner, but last year Taiwan was
replaced by India, which recorded a two-way trade of 46 billion euros with the
EU.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs, the
European Economic and Trade Office pointed out that new EU investment in Taiwan
totaled US$7 billion in 2006, accounting for more than half of all new foreign
investment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As a result, accumulated EU direct investment in Taiwan has more than doubled to
US$15 billion, accounting for 20 percent of all foreign direct investment in
Taiwan and making the EU the largest foreign investor in Taiwan, ahead of the
United States and Japan.</P>
      <P>The number of Taiwanese visitors to the EU reached a record high of 330,000 last
year, representing an increase of 10 percent over 2005.</P>
      <P>Approximately 25,000 Taiwanese students are studying in Europe today, including
more than 12,000 who enrolled in 2006. Many students from Taiwan have taken
advantage of opportunities offered by EU member states  and the EU Commission
to obtain  grants  and scholarships.</P>
      <P>Guy Ledoux, head of the European Economic and Trade Office in Taiwan, who
assumed office in March, said in the newsletter that his office will continue to
promote a healthy trade environment in Taiwan for the 25-state EU.</P>
      <P>"Dialogue and willingness to resolve trade issues will continue to be the most
productive approach," Ledoux said.</P>

      <P>A lawmaker urged the Central Election Commission (CEC) Monday to ask the Council
of Grand Justices (CGJ) for a constitutional explanation on the bid by former
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, an indicted suspect on
corruption charges, to run in the 2008 presidential race.</P>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Yu Cheng-tao made the call
in a Legislative Yuan news conference, as it is increasingly obvious that Ma is
set to become the main opposition KMT's presidential candidate. Ma is widely
believed to be a strong contender in the 2008 presidential polls.</P>
      <P>Yu called on the CEC to ask the CGJ to rule on Ma's presidential bid after he
registers with the CEC to run in the next presidential election or on the
constitutionality of his election, to fend off unnecessary rows in the future
should he be convicted after his election.</P>
      <P>As the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law bans citizens
convicted with a prison term of over 10 years in the first trial or those
convicted in the third and final trial on corruption charges from running in
presidential elections, Yu also urged Ma to drop his presidential bid, as the
ex-KMT chief was indicted in mid-February by Taipei prosecutors on corruption
charges.</P>
      <P>Holding a new presidential election would cost about NT$1.2 billion, he said.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court has opened two hearings on Ma's case since early this
month over his alleged embezzlement of about NT$11 million in funds from a
special monthly municipal allowance earmarked for his discretionary use when he
served as mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006.</P>
      <P>Ma maintains his innocence and has represented himself in his defense during the
two sessions.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan will release the results of an investigation into the main
opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) "ill-gotten" party assets April 25, and a Web site
publishing the survey outcome will go online that same day, an Executive Yuan
official said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the survey on the KMT's illegally or improperly
acquired party assets during its authoritarian rule of Taiwan, was completed
recently by agencies under the Executive Yuan coordinated by Minister without
Portfolio Hsu Chih-hsiung.</P>
      <P>The official said the investigation results will include many categories,
including real estate owned by the KMT or its affiliates, revenues of the
party's business, and surplus retirement payments for retired  KMT personnel
whose party employment  was considered equivalent to government seniority.</P>
      <P>Quoting  statistics  conducted  by  the  National  Property Administration under
the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the official said the KMT has 685 plots of
land registered of a total of 148 hectares, valued at about NT$24.32 billion.
Another NT$168 million comes from the party's ownership of the Chientan Youth
Activity Center.</P>
      <P>Statistics of the Ministry of Economic Affairs show that seven main businesses
owned by the KMT gained net revenue of NT$87.1 billion from 1994-2005, the
official said, adding that NT$100 million has been paid to 267 retired KMT
personnel who were allowed to count their party employment toward their
government seniority and received pensions accordingly.</P>

      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Monday he believes that President Chen Shui-bian is
neutral on the four contenders bidding to represent the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) in the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks in an interview with CNA amid reports that Chen is throwing
his weight behind Su in the hotly contested primary.</P>
      <P>To the best of his knowledge, Su said, Chen has so far kept an "appropriate and
congruent distance from each hopeful" in his capacity as the country's head of
state and the party's most important figure.</P>
      <P>"President Chen has maintained his noble status as the country's head of state
and is unlikely to express his personal preference regarding the candidacy
choice at the moment, " Su said.</P>
      <P>In the DPP primary fray, Su's political rivals have questioned his loyalty
toward Chen during last year's "red-shirt" campaign aimed at forcing Chen to
step down over corruption allegations and Su's handling of a controversial plan
to build an expressway linking the eastern county of Hualien to Suao in the
northeastern county of Yilan.</P>
      <P>On those two cases, Chen offered prompt and detailed explanations favorable to
Su, which led to speculation that Chen backs Su.</P>
      <P>Su described the speculation as meaningless. "Chen stood up mainly because he
was personally involved in those issues and was in the best position to clarify
misunderstandings," he added.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, Su went on, there tends to be good faith between the president and
the premier. "Without the president's trust, a premier can't do anything," he
said.</P>

      <P>Defying the traditional concept that physically and mentally disabled people are
not competitive in the high-tech industry, executives of three local electronic
firms hailed them Monday for their efficiency.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officers of three companies made the remarks at a press
conference held in Taipei to mark the 10th anniversary of the promulgation of
the country's Physically and Mentally Disabled Citizens Protection Act.</P>
      <P>The CEO of Siliconware Precision Industries Co., the world's third-largest
provider of semiconductor assembly and test services, noted that they now hire
139 physically and mentally disabled persons in comparison with the total number
of 11,505 employees of the company.</P>
      <P>The executive admitted that although physically and mentally disabled people
learn things relatively slowly, they are more likely to concentrate.</P>
      <P>Citing the example of some aurally impaired employees, the CEO said they can
totally focus on their work since they are less likely to be bothered by outside
noise.</P>
      <P>In addition, they will treasure their jobs more and perform excellently if given
the opportunity, the CEO added.</P>
      <P>The Chipbond Technology Corp., which is a leading provider of wafer bumping
services, was fined for several years for failing to hire a sufficient
percentage of physically and mentally disabled persons as stipulated by the law,
until it finally hired the required ratio early this year.</P>
      <P>A Chipbond executive said the company found the lifetime of the production
machines increased, which the firm attributed to the care of the disabled
employees. Among the current 1,937 employees of Chipbond, 24 are disabled.</P>
      <P>A section chief of Coretronic, a 1,000-employee company dedicated to offering
projection and display solutions, said the firm employs 33 physically and
mentally disabled persons.</P>
      <P>With adequate arrangements,  the Coretronic executive said, disability does not
cause a hindrance to working ability.</P>
      <P>Lee Ying-yuan, chairman of the Council of Labor Affairs (COA) , said on the same
occasion that the COA's goal for this year is to train some 3,000 physically or
mentally disabled persons and to help 3,000 of them to find work in public
organizations or private corporations.</P>

      <P>The average jobless rate in the first three months of the year hit a six-year
low of 3.84 percent, down 0.02 percentage points from the same period of last

      <P>According to officials at the Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), the March unemployment rate was 3.94 percent,
up 0.16 percentage points from the previous month, thanks mainly to the end of
short-term jobs offered during the Chinese New Year holiday and an increase in
the number of people seeking new jobs after the holiday.</P>
      <P>The number of jobless was 420,000 in March, up 18,000 from the previous month,
which the officials said were the second-lowest March figure in nearly six
years.</P>
      <P>The average number of jobless in the first three months of this year hit a six-
year low compared with the average jobless rate of 5.14 percent in the first
three months of 2002, 5.09 percent in 2003, 4.53 percent in 2004, 4.16 percent

      <P>Residents from four of Taipei County's townships voiced strong opposition Monday
to a plan by Taiwan's Nuclear Power Plant No. 1 to build a dry-storage facility
at the plant site to keep its spent nuclear fuel.</P>
      <P>The heads of Wanli, Shihmen, Chinshan and Sanchih townships and some  200
residents  gathered  in front  of the Cabinet-level Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) to protest the proposal by Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) to
build the storage facility within the grounds of Nuclear Power Plant No. 1 in
Taipei County.</P>
      <P>The EPA's Department of Comprehensive Planning is currently assessing the
construction plan's possible impact on the environment.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chang-ming, president of an inter-township association for the promotion of
nuclear power plant safety, said it is not fair to residents of Taipei County
because three of Taiwan's four nuclear power plants are located in their county,
with the No. 1 plant in Shihmen township, the No. 2 plant in Wanli township, and
the No. 4 plant -- still under construction -- in Kungliao township.</P>
      <P>Tsai said Taipei County residents  are firmly opposed  to Taipower's plan to
build a spent fuel dry-storage facility at the site of Nuclear Power Plant No.
1.</P>
      <P>Shihmen township head Liang Yu-hsueh noted that Taipower has held some 200
briefings in Taipei County in an attempt to convince its residents of the safety
of the facility.</P>
      <P>"Those Taipei County residents who attended the briefings have not the slightest
idea of what a dry-storage facility is about when Taipower asked them whether
they would accept the plan, yet Taipower has claimed to EPA officials that the
Taipei County residents have demonstrated a high level of acceptance of the
plan," Liang said.</P>
      <P>Spent nuclear fuel -- a byproduct of the fission of uranium in commercial
nuclear plants -- is highly radioactive.</P>
      <P>Currently, spent nuclear fuel is stored in deep pools of water at most nuclear
power plants. However, by designing facilities for spent nuclear fuel dry
storage, the need for maintaining high cost pools can be eliminated.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER TOUTS COMPETITIVE EDGE OVER KMT CONTENDER</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Monday he is confident that if he wins the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) mandate to run in the 2008 presdiential
election, he will beat his rival from the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Speaking in an interview with CNA, Su said he possesses a competitive edge that
will enable him to defeat Ma Ying-jeou -- the KMT's best bet for the next
presidency.</P>
      <P>"My competitive edge includes political integrity, resoluteness, competence  and
a distinctive  'Taiwanese  flavor, '" he said confidently.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan's political map, Su said, the DPP has a firm grip in southern Taiwan
while the KMT's power base lies in northern Taiwan. "I'm the only one who has
been elected as county magistrate in both southern and northern Taiwan," he said
proudly.</P>
      <P>Su once served as magistrate of the southernmost county of Pingtung. He had also
twice beat his rivals from the KMT-led "pan-blue" camp to win the magistrateship
of Taiwan's most populous county -- Taipei County in northern Taiwan whose
population accounts for one-sixth of the country's total.</P>
      <P>While seeking re-election as Taipei County magistrate, Su said he received
support from across the political spectrum. "Both my home county Pingtung and
Taipei County can serve as my campaign bases if I'm nominated by the DPP to run
for the presidency," he added.</P>
      <P>On prosecution authorities' ongoing investigations into several prominent
political figures' use of their discretionary special allowance funds, including
Su's, the premier said he took the probes in stride.</P>
      <P>"Any public figure must withstand stringent test and scrutiny. Moral integrity
has been one of my priorities in pursuing political career. I have never come
under any question in this regard. If I'm found to have breached or transgressed
the law with regard to the use of the special allowance funds set aside for my
discretionary use, I would definitely pull out of the presidential race, " Su
said categorically.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors  started to probe how Su and three other DPP presidential contenders
-- Vice President annette Lu, DPP Cahirman Yu Shyi-kun and former DPP Chairman
Frank Hsieh -- had used their special allowance funds during their stints as
local government chiefs after KMT's Ma was indicted Feb. 13 over his alleged
misuse of special allowance funds during his tenure as Taipei mayor between 1998
and 2006.</P>
      <P>In the past, Su said, Ma projected a clean image and the public hold high
expectation of his integrity. Immediately after Ma was elected KMT chairman in
2005, he pushed for his party to formulate a regulation that required its
members to quit political posts if they are indicted over corruption charges. As
a results, many KMT local government chiefs quit the party after they were
indicted on corruption charges.</P>
      <P>"However, Ma was lenient toward himself. The KMT invalidated such anti-
corruption stipulation right after Ma was indicted, " Su said, adding that the
KMT-led "pan-blue" alliance had even thwarted the DPP's recent efforts to revise
the current law in a bid to prevent those who are convicted in the first trial
to run for the president. Ma has vowed to pursue his presidential bid even if he
is convicted in the final trial.</P>
      <P>Su also criticized Ma's inconsistence in his attitude toward the KMT assets.
"Before Ma was elected KMT chairman, he promised to return the party's ill-
gotten assets to the ntional coffers. Once he was elected chairman, he quickly
sold out many controversial assets and the legality of those dealings have been
called into questioned," Su said.</P>
      <P>As to personal competence and decisiveness in policy-making, Su said the
devastating 921 earthquake provided a god-send opportunity for comparison of his
and Ma's emergency response capabilities.</P>
      <P>"When the earthquake happened on Sept. 21, 1999, I was Taipei County magistrate.
Two buildings collapsed in the earthquake, while only one building was toppled
in Taipei City where Ma was mayor. The collapsed Taipei building has so far not
yet been rebuilt, while the two toppled buildings in Taipei County had been
completed before I ended my magistrateship tenure," Su said.</P>

      <P>The Tourism Bureau announced Monday that it will slap a fine of NT$60,000
(US$1,820) on a travel service company for failing to provide minimum quality
service to a group of Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials noted that to embrace fully the opportunities arising from
opening Taiwan to Chinese tourists on sightseeing tours, the bureau and travel
service operators agreed late last year to promote a program to upgrade travel
services. Program measures included the requirement that tour operators spend no
less than US$80 daily for each member of a Chinese tourist group, and the age of
tour buses used by Chinese tourist groups not exceed seven years.</P>
      <P>The officials stressed that the standards aim at ensuring a certain level of
quality service for Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the travel service company recently arranged for a
Chinese tourist group to stay at a hotel in Changhua where the expenses for one
night's stay were only a little over than NT$500.</P>
      <P>But according to the US$80 minimum expenses per day for one Chinese tourist, the
accommodations should have cost over NT$1,000 for one night.</P>
      <P>Shockingly, one member of the tour group was bitten by a rat while staying in
that hotel.</P>
      <P>For failing to care properly for the safety of the tourists and ensuring that
the tourists met the minimum expense requirement, the bureau has decided to
discipline the travel service company, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The bureau's announcement came amid reports that travel services and bus
operators, disgruntled at the bureau's strict regulations, will rally at the
bureau Tuesday to stage a protest.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials explained that the requirement that buses used by the Chinese
tourist groups not exceed seven years is due to concerns that Chinese tourists
usually visit scenic spots as Sun Moon Lake and Mt. Ali, which require travel on
mountainous roads, so ensuring that the buses are in good condition is a vital
safety consideration.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that the name "Taiwan" is the best logo
that the Taiwanese people have and that his name "rectification" work will
continue to help correct the wrongs of past administrations.</P>
      <P>Speaking to a group of visiting representatives of the World Taiwanese Chambers
of Commerce at the Presidential Office, Chen said that insisting on a Taiwan-
centric consciousness or a "Taiwanese national identity" is now an "irreversible
trend."</P>
      <P>Saying that the right of the public to use the name "Taiwan" should never be
taken away, Chen said the word "Taiwan" is the best, most beautiful and most
powerful name that the Taiwanese could ever have used.</P>
      <P>In the past, due to some specious political reasons, the name of "Taiwan" had
been prohibited, resulting in identity disputes among groups of different
political affiliations, as well as Taiwan's confinement in the international
community, he said.</P>
      <P>This mistake made by the previous Kuomintang administration has been a source of
agony for the entire Taiwan population, he added.</P>
      <P>The mistake, nevertheless,  should not remain unchanged or unchallenged, the
president went on.</P>
      <P>Chen said the name-changing work will continue, now that the word "Taiwan" is
included on Republic of China passports, the name of the Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport has been changed to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport
and Chunghwa Post Co. has been changed to Taiwan Post Co.</P>
      <P>In the near future, he said, the names of many other state-owned enterprises
will also be changed to carry the word "Taiwan, " including  Chinese Petroleum
Corp.  into Taiwan CPC and China Shipbuilding Corp. into Taiwan International
Shipbuilding Corp. to make them more identifiable with their country of origin.</P>
      <P>Chen called for the support of Taiwanese chambers of commerce scattered around
of world to the country's efforts to join the World Health Organization and the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung municipal Shou Shan Zoo was fiercely criticized by several councilors
during a city council question period Monday for what they called poor
management, a lack of professionalism and inhumane treatment of animals.</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) city councilor Lien Li-jen dressed himself
like an orangutan to express concern for the mental condition of zoo orangutan
that always hides itself and appears to be afraid of people.</P>
      <P>Lien said many animals in the zoo display abnormal behavior, are in poor health
and appear solitary or aggressive.</P>
      <P>The zoo acts against the global trend in promoting animal welfare, Lien said,
suggesting that the zoo, which he describes as poorly-funded and dysfunctional,
be closed.</P>
      <P>Hung Fu-feng, head of the city government's Economic Affairs Bureau (EAB) ,
which oversees the zoo, said the bureau will draft a plan to reform the zoo.</P>
      <P>Earlier  this month,  a crocodile  in the zoo bit off a veterinarian's left
forearm while the vet was attempting to remove anesthetic needles from it. DPP
councilor Lee Wen-liang demanded that the EAB clarify responsibilities  over the
incident  and take disciplinary actions accordingly.</P>
      <P>He also asked that bureau raise the amount of danger pay for zoo staff.</P>
      <P>The male crocodile that attacked the vet was, for 10 years, regarded by the zoo
as a Nile crocodile, but after the high-profile incident drew experts' attention
was found to be a saltwater crocodile, to the zoo's embarrassment.</P>
      <P>In a similar story, a female elephant resident in the zoo for 28 years was
recently reported to have been mistaken as male, though the zoo officials said
an event five years ago to find it awifewas just a PR activity.</P>
      <P>However, Kuomintang (KMT) councilor Mei Tzai-hsing called the "mistake"
unforgivable, saying the zoo was inhumane in failing, for decades, to find it a
male companion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER PLANS TO EMBARK ON DIPLOMATIC TOURS IF WINNING DPP PRIMARY</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Monday he will embark on overseas tours if he wins
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) mandate to run in the 2008
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks in an interview with CNA as the DPP presidential primary
continued to heat up after two rounds of televised policy debates among the four
contenders.</P>
      <P>Given Taiwan's diplomatic plight, Su said the government has consistently spared
no effort to enhance the country's international profile. If he manages to win
the DPP primary, Su said he will visit as many countries as possible,
particularly Taiwan's major security and trading partners, in his capacity as
the ruling party's candidate for the next presidency.</P>
      <P>In the DPP primary fray, Su has often come under fire from the rivaling camps
over alleged abuse of his position for electoral gains. Su said he foresaw such
a scenario long before the primary race began.</P>
      <P>"I offered to quit the premiership when the last legislative session ended early
this year. But President Chen Shui-bian asked me to stay to complete many
important policy initiatives. Out of good faith between me and the president, I
decided to stay, " Su said, adding that he may offer to resign again in case he
wins the primary.</P>
      <P>"If the situation becomes difficult or unfavorable for me to carry out major
policy initiatives, I'll consider stepping down from my current job," Su
explained.</P>
      <P>As to whether he would reshuffle the Cabinet in short term, Su said it's not on
his agenda since the administrative team is working smoothly in high morale.</P>
      <P>Su also touted his team's achievement in promoting tourism in innovative ways,
including naming the pop band F4 as "tourism ambassador" in attracting tourists
from Japanese and South Korea. Just on Sunday, some 5,000 of the group's
Japanese and South Korean fans visited Taipei to meet with their idols.</P>
      <P>"Over the past few years, we have adopted many new measures to sell Taiwan in a
bid to rev up our sluggish tourist industry. Thanks to concerted efforts in the
public and private sectors, we have reaped encouraging results. The number of
tourist arrivals have increased steadily in the past two years and the number is
expected to hit a new high this year," Su said.</P>
      <P>Asked about the government's policy on casino business, Su said the government
would consider opening the business in the context of promoting tourism. "We
would not open gambling for gambling's sake. We would allow for such business
only on the premise of attracting foreign tourists," he added.</P>
      <P>Touched on foreign private equity groups' increasing interest in acquiring local
blue-chip companies, Su said the government will respect market mechanism in
dealing with those issues.</P>

      <P>Lawmakers of the People First Party (PFP) will certainly attend the Procedure
Committee meeting Tuesday and help block passage of two key draft bills of major
concern to the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), a PFP lawmaker said Monday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hwang Yih-jiau, who also serves as the executive director of the
PFP's central policy center, gave his assurances that PFP lawmakers will
"definitely" take part in the meeting and join forces with their KMT
counterparts to prevent the two draft bills from again being included on the
legislative agenda.</P>
      <P>"There will be no surprise on the part of the PFP, " Hwang said. "The PFP is a
political party that lives up to its promises."</P>
      <P>Due to the absence of PFP and Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU) lawmakers,
their peers from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its ally, the
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , were able at the April 17 committee meeting to
push the two bills through for further screening.</P>
      <P>One seeks to ban indicted citizens from pursuing presidency, apparently directed
at former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, and the other targets the return of the
KMT's ill-gotten assets.</P>
      <P>But the two bills were defeated by KMT, PFP and NPSU lawmakers during last
Friday's committee session on a KMT-initiated proposal that the meeting be
adjourned, after the KMT and the PFP inked a 7-point pledge early that same day
on bilateral cooperation in December's legislative election.</P>
      <P>In addition to agreeing to allot five constituencies to be handled by the PFP in
the legislative election, the KMT also promised the PFP  to wrap  up two-way
coordination  in the remaining constituencies within two weeks -- a development
that helped bring about a temporary cease fire between the two allied parties.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Chang Hsien-yao, who also leads the party's central policy
center, urged Monday evening the two parties to open high-level talks as soon as
possible to coordinate their actions in the upcoming legislative election.</P>
      <P>Chang called on the two parties to examine their relationship strategically so
as to free themselves of much of the baggage troubling them.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang voiced agreement Monday with the idea of combining the
upcoming legislative and presidential elections, but said the decision to be
rendered by the Central Election Commission (CEC) should be respected.</P>
      <P>Su made the comments in an exclusive interview with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>According to Su, the public should be willing to see the two high-profile
elections combined as doing so is more cost-effective. The legislative election
is set for December this year, while the presidential race is slated for March,
2008.</P>
      <P>However, the premier said that he is not in a position to ask the CEC do so
because the issue must be decided by the CEC -- the central government agency in
charge of national electoral affairs.</P>
      <P>What is more, he said, the CEC organic law has been stonewalled in the
Legislative Yuan for some time due to the boycott by the opposition "pan-blue
alliance, " preventing a new CEC from being set up so as to make a final
decision on the issue.</P>
      <P>Commenting  on another proposal,  which would allow public referendums to be
held along with presidential elections, Su called the proposal a commonplace
measure in all democratic nations and questioned why the main opposition
Kuomintang views it as a "monstrosity."</P>
      <P>As to an inquiry on whether he would consider resigning from the premiership
should he outgun his rivals in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
presidential primary, Su responded that he will fully delve into the matter if
he wins the party's nomination.</P>
      <P>Stressing that he has stayed as premier under instructions from President Chen
Shui-bian, Su said that he will not step down from the post simply because doing
so would make it easier for him to vie for the party's presidential nomination
by freeing him of a shadow cast by allegations that he can easily allocate
administrative resources to campaign for himself or craft policies to lure voter
support.</P>
      <P>Su also dismissed rumors that there will be a partial re-shuffle of the Cabinet,
saying that all present Cabinet members are well placed and that he will not
make any adjustments in the short term.</P>
      <P>Regarding a DPP central committee proposal that the first two winners in the
presidential primary pair up a ticket to run in the next presidential election,
he said that "ideals and philosophy" on the administration of the nation are
more important to him in terms of selecting a running mate.</P>

English teaching methods with elementary and junior high school teachers.</P>
      <P>Stack came to Taiwan for five seminars from April 23-27 at the invitation of the
MOE with an aim to improve Taiwanese teachers' teaching efficiency.</P>
      <P>A specialist in English education for students from kindergarten to grade 12,
Stack has consulted on English teaching methods in a number of Asian countries,
including Japan and Honk Kong. She is especially involved in teenage English
education, curriculum design, learning evaluation, and education standards of

      <P>In Monday's seminar, Stack pointed out that interactive classroom learning
activities help to elicit students' attention and interest, and that group
discussions in class are beneficial to boosting students' learning efficiency as
they create opportunities for students to practice their skills and help
teachers with classroom management.</P>
      <P>Teachers in the U.S. use a lot of group discussions in class to help non-English

      <P>During the seminar, Stack also encouraged extra curricular learning from

      <P>Taiwan will continue to exert its "soft power" and dedicate itself to democracy,
peace, human rights, love and the development of advanced technologies to win
the world's recognition, Vice President Annette Lu said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks at an assembly of an association promoting cultural and
trade exchanges between Taiwan and Mongolia. She also presented credentials to
the association's newly elected directors and supervisors at the assembly.</P>
      <P>Before its independence from China, Mongolia was able to withstand a great
threat from China and eventually became a democratic country, Lu said, adding
that this was not an easy task and that Mongolia deserves praise from the people
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>She also noted that the Mongolian government and people use modernization to
promote democracy and human rights, as well as sharing its culture with the
world.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, on the other hand, is small, but uses "soft power" to stand strongly in
the international community and take great leaps forward in this highly
competitive era, the vice president continued.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been under a grave military threat from China for 50 years, but the
people of Taiwan have never compromised and face the challenges squarely, Lu
said.</P>
      <P>As a result, Taiwan has been able to sustain its development and create
prosperity and progress, Lu went on, describing Taiwan as "a miracle in the
world."</P>
      <P>Saying that Taiwan is willing to cooperate and exchange experiences with
Mongolia, Lu noted that although the two nations are geographically apart, the
distance can be narrowed through the help of the association.</P>
      <P>She said Taiwan faces many difficulties in the international arena.  However,
she added,  the 21st Century is an era of globalization and Taiwan will expand

      <P>Olivia Newton-John and her band decided Monday to stay in Taiwan for an extra
day to savor Taiwan's delicacies after enchanting more than 9,000 Taiwanese fans
in a pair of concerts the previous two nights.</P>
      <P>Newton-John, who arrived in Taipei April 19, was scheduled to leave for
Singapore for her next leg in her current four-nation Asian tour, but decided to
delay her departure to Tuesday afternoon, so that she could have a full extra
day free to visit Taipei's night markets and taste some of the unique delicacies
recommended by organizers of her performances in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The 58-year-old Australian singer gave two concerts in the Taipei Arena on
Saturday and Sunday nights and achieved a resounding success.</P>
      <P>She led her fans -- most in their 40's to 60's -- back through time with a
string of hits from a repertoire of her famous songs, including "Have You Never
Been Mellow," "A Little More Love," "Stronger Than Before," "Xanadu," "Magic,"
"Suddenly," and "Physical."</P>
      <P>On her second day in Taipei, Newton-John and her entourage took time out to
visit the National Palace Museum. Unable to see much because of the intense
media attention, she said she will find another time to visit the museum.</P>
      <P>Taipei is the second leg of Newton-John's current Asian tour and the only city
to enjoy a pair of concerts. She performed in Hong Kong April 15 before coming
to Taipei. She will also give one concert in Singapore April 27, followed by
another performance in Kuala Lumpur April 29.</P>
      <P>Newton-John's original schedule included one concert in Shanghai April 24 but
the performance was later cancelled.</P>
      <P>Newton-John settled in Malibu, near Los Angeles after winning a series of Grammy
Awards for her work. She has also won numerous Country Music Awards, American
Music Awards and People's Choice Awards.</P>
      <P>A versatile singer, Newton-John has covered rock songs as well as the gentle
folk songs and ballads which formed her early repertoire.</P>
      <P>She starred with John Travolta in the 1978 movie Grease, catapulting herself to
super-stardom with such hits as "You're The One That I Want," "Summer Nights"
and "Hopelessly Devoted To You."</P>
      <P>In 1981, she reached the pinnacle of her career with her million-selling single
"Physical."</P>
      <P>After recuperating  from breast  cancer  surgery  in 1992, Newton-John became a

      <P>The two frontrunners in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)  primary
fray for the 2008 presidential election continued squabbling Monday over the
"one China" framework of the country's Constitution.</P>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang, who is seeking for the DPP nomination to run for next
presidency, said in an interview with CNA that Frank Hsieh, Su's predecessor who
is also bidding to represent the DPP in the 2008 election, should clarify his
"one China" Constitution framework rhetoric because none of those aspiring for
presidency should dodge the issue regarding the country's status.</P>
      <P>Su on Hsieh has said on numerous previous occasions that Taiwan's current
Constitution has a "one China" framework in which China refers to the Republic
of China -- Taiwan's official title.</P>
      <P>Claiming  that Hsieh's rhetoric has caused confusions  and misgivings among many
DPP politicians and grassroots supporters, Su said Hsieh should expound on the
content of his "one China" framework doctrine.</P>
      <P>The pro-independence DPP has been very sensitive to the term "one China" because
Beijing has never hesitated to tell the world its ultimate goal of unify Taiwan
under the "one China" principle and the almost the entire world perceives "one
China" as the People's Republic of China, Beijing's national title.</P>
      <P>Su said Hsieh must clarify his stance on the issue; otherwise, he claimed that
the DPP would be identical with the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) with regard
to Taiwan's status and the country's future.</P>
      <P>Su trailed behind the top-ranking Hsieh in an opinion poll conducted by alocal
newspaper immediately after Saturday's second round of policy debates among the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Olivia Newton-John and her band decided Monday to stay in Taiwan for an extra
day to savor Taiwan's delicacies after enchanting more than 9,000 Taiwanese fans
in a pair of concerts the previous two nights.</P>
      <P>Newton-John, who arrived in Taipei April 19, was scheduled to leave for
Singapore for her next leg in her current four-nation Asian tour, but decided to
delay her departure to Tuesday afternoon, so that she could have a full extra
day free to visit Taipei's night markets and taste some of the unique delicacies
recommended by organizers of her performances in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The 58-year-old Australian singer gave two concerts in the Taipei Arena on
Saturday and Sunday nights and achieved a resounding success.</P>
      <P>She led her fans -- most in their 40's to 60's -- back through time with a
string of hits from a repertoire of her famous songs, including "Have You Never
Been Mellow," "A Little More Love," "Stronger Than Before," "Xanadu," "Magic,"
"Suddenly," and "Physical."</P>
      <P>On her second day in Taipei, Newton-John and her entourage took time out to
visit the National Palace Museum. Unable to see much because of the intense
media attention, she said she will find another time to visit the museum.</P>
      <P>Taipei is the second leg of Newton-John's current Asian tour and the only city
to enjoy a pair of concerts. She performed in Hong Kong April 15 before coming
to Taipei. She will also give one concert in Singapore April 27, followed by
another performance in Kuala Lumpur April 29.</P>
      <P>Newton-John's original schedule included one concert in Shanghai April 24 but
the performance was later cancelled.</P>
      <P>Newton-John settled in Malibu, near Los Angeles after winning a series of Grammy
Awards for her work. She has also won numerous Country Music Awards, American
Music Awards and People's Choice Awards.</P>
      <P>A versatile singer, Newton-John has covered rock songs as well as the gentle
folk songs and ballads which formed her early repertoire.</P>
      <P>She starred with John Travolta in the 1978 movie Grease, catapulting herself to
super-stardom with such hits as "You're The One That I Want," "Summer Nights"
and "Hopelessly Devoted To You."</P>
      <P>In 1981, she reached the pinnacle of her career with her million-selling single
"Physical."</P>
      <P>After recuperating  from breast  cancer  surgery  in 1992, Newton-John became a
staunch supporter of breast cancer awareness charities and has been advocating
early detection and treatment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWO DPP PRIMARY FRONTRUNNERS SPAT OVER 'ONE CHINA'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  23  (CNA)
04/24/07  09:40:54
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The two frontrunners in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)  primary
fray for the 2008 presidential election continued squabbling Monday over the
"one China" framework of the country's Constitution.</P>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang, who is seeking for the DPP nomination to run for next
presidency, said in an interview with CNA that Frank Hsieh, Su's predecessor who
is also bidding to represent the DPP in the 2008 election, should clarify his
"one China" Constitution framework rhetoric because none of those aspiring for
presidency should dodge the issue regarding the country's status.</P>
      <P>According to Su, Hsieh has said on numerous previous occasions that Taiwan's
current Constitution has a "one China" framework in which China refers to the
Republic of China -- Taiwan's official title.</P>
      <P>Claiming  that Hsieh's rhetoric has caused confusions  and misgivings among many
DPP politicians and grassroots supporters, Su said Hsieh should expound on the
content of his "one China" framework doctrine.</P>
      <P>The pro-independence DPP has been very sensitive to the term "one China" because
Beijing has never hesitated to tell the world its ultimate goal of unify Taiwan
under the "one China" principle and almost the entire world perceives "one
China" as the People's Republic of China, Beijing's national title.</P>
      <P>Su said Hsieh must clarify his stance on the issue; otherwise, he claimed that
the DPP would be identical with the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) with regard
to Taiwan's status and the country's future.</P>
      <P>Su trailed behind the top-ranking Hsieh in an opinion poll conducted by a local
newspaper immediately after Saturday's second round of policy debates among the
four DPP presidential contenders which also include Vice President Annette Lu
and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun. In Saturday's debate, Su and Hsieh already
quarreled over the "one China" framework issues.</P>
      <P>In the interview with CNA, Su was asked whether he is willing to pair with Hsieh
if he wins DPP primary, su said the issue regarding "one China" framework should
be resolved first.</P>
      <P>"For me, political conviction is most important and relevant. It should come
first before the pairing-up issue will be addressed. Position, power or fame is
not so important for me. I can withdraw from the race if my political ideals and
convictions have to be compromised," he added.</P>
      <P>In response to Su's challenge for a further explanation of the doctrine, Chao
Tien-lin, spokesman for the Hsih campaign, said it is Su himself most obliged to
explain his stance on the constitutional reform issues.</P>
      <P>"Su had vowed on previous occasions, such as when he assumed office as
presidential secretary-general and the DPP chairmanship, not to touch on such
sensitive issues as the independence vs. unification  debate,  change  of
national  title and territory boundaries, " Chao said, adding that Su should
explain why he is now so eager to address the constitutional framework issues.</P>
      <P>"Hsieh has repeatedly explained that the 'one China' framework is an issue
Taiwan must face squarely because it's the shackles Taiwan should cast off and
break free, " Chao said, adding that Hsieh called attention to the issue in an
aim to have the "one Chian" framework revised, scrapped or overturned, not to
uphold it.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER FAVORS COMBINING ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 23 (CNA)
04/24/07  09:42:14
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang voiced agreement Monday with the idea of combining the
upcoming legislative and presidential elections, but said the decision to be
rendered by the Central Election Commission (CEC) should be respected.</P>
      <P>Su made the comments in an exclusive interview with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>According to Su, the public should be willing to see the two high-profile
elections combined as doing so is more cost-effective. The legislative election
is set for December this year, while the presidential race is slated for March,
2008.</P>
      <P>However, the premier said that he is not in a position to ask the CEC do so
because the issue must be decided by the CEC -- the central government agency in
charge of national electoral affairs.</P>
      <P>What is more, he said, the CEC organic law has been stonewalled in the
Legislative Yuan for some time due to the boycott by the opposition "pan-blue
alliance, " preventing a new CEC from being set up so as to make a final
decision on the issue.</P>
      <P>Commenting  on another proposal,  which would allow public referendums to be
held along with presidential elections, Su called the proposal a commonplace
measure in all democratic nations and questioned why the main opposition
Kuomintang views it as a "monstrosity."</P>
      <P>As to an inquiry on whether he would consider resigning from the premiership
should he outgun his rivals in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
presidential primary, Su responded that he will fully delve into the matter if
he wins the party's nomination.</P>
      <P>Stressing that he has stayed as premier under instructions from President Chen
Shui-bian, Su said that he will not step down from the post simply because doing
so would make it easier for him to vie for the party's presidential nomination
by freeing him of a shadow cast by allegations that he can easily allocate
administrative resources to campaign for himself or craft policies to lure voter
support.</P>
      <P>Su also dismissed rumors that there will be a partial re-shuffle of the Cabinet,
saying that all present Cabinet members are well placed and that he will not
make any adjustments in the short term.</P>
      <P>Regarding a DPP central committee proposal that the first two winners in the
presidential primary pair up a ticket to run in the next presidential election,
he said that "ideals and philosophy" on the administration of the nation are
more important to him in terms of selecting a running mate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OVER 80% PENSIONERS WANT MORE SAY ON PENSION FUND'S USE: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  23 (CNA)
04/24/07  11:11:48
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 80 percent of those who have joined the two-year-old portable pension
system look forward to having a say in determining how the reserve funds should
be used for profit-making, according to the results of an opinion survey
released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the Securities Investment Trust and Consulting
Association (SITCA) in cooperation with the Global View Magazine between March
23 and April 1 to explore local wage earners' knowledge and opinions about the
relatively new portable pension system. A total of 1,002 valid samples were
collected in the survey, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1
percentage points.</P>
      <P>Among the respondents, 44.5 percent said they are very supportive of the
proposal to revise the current law to allow for a say by wage earners on the use
of portable pension fund reserves for lucrative investment deals; 36.1 percent
said they somewhat support the proposal; and only 16.2 percent gave a negative
response.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, the number of wage earners who opted for the portable
pension system had reached 5.64 million as of April 18, with the total pension
fund reserves accumulated under the scheme exceeding NT$140.7 billion (US$4.26
billion) . Moreover, the amount has been increasing by about NT$8 billion per
month.</P>
      <P>After more than a year of delay, the Legislative Yuan finally passed the statute
on the pension fund reserves management and supervision earlier this year.</P>
      <P>However, the survey results showed that 65 percent of the respondents were not
aware that only the government is authorized to manage the fund and that
pensioners are guaranteed a minimum profit equivalent to the interest rate for
two-year time deposits at local banks. If the fund's earnings do not reach that
level, the government is obliged to make up the difference at the expense of
taxpayers, according to the statute.</P>
      <P>A SITCA spokesman said the survey results indicated that the government should
step up a publicity campaign to help pensioners better understand how the
portable pension system operates as well as their legitimate rights under the
scheme.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 68 percent said they are not confident of the
government's efficacy in running the pension reserve funds, while nearly 80
percent said it is inappropriate to use taxpayer's money to make up the
difference if the fund's earnings fall below the set minimum.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 74 percent said they are willing to accept the consequences if they
are allowed to choose investment targets for their pension reserves, and 57
percent said they are confident in their ability to make the right investment
decisions.</P>
      <P>Noting that many advanced countries allow pensioners to decide on their own on
the pension fund investment targets, the SITCA spokesman said the government
should follow suit by coming up with draft law revisions.</P>

      <P>Private citizens, corporations and social groups will be eligible to own locally
registered  airplanes, according to a draft package of amendments to the
existing Civil Aviation Law that passed the first reading in the legislature
Monday.</P>
      <P>Private owners, however, will be prohibited from using their aircraft for
commercial operations or leasing,  civil aviation official said.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the revised law, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)
will be required to regularly send staff to inspect personnel, equipment and
flight operations of privately-owned aircraft.</P>
      <P>At present, wealthy Taiwanese families tend to have their private aircraft
registered in foreign countries. Once the proposed revisions are formally
enacted, they can legally register their aircraft with the CAA and apply for
flights in line with relevant regulations.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a recent survey, more than 20 of Taiwan's top 500
corporations have expressed interest in purchasing small airplanes.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendments also provide a legal basis for private business groups
as well as city and county governments to construct and operate airports.</P>
      <P>To date, CAA Director Chang Kuo-cheng said, the Kinmen County government is the
only local government to have asked about the feasibility of operating an
airport. Kinmen officials dropped the idea after learning that the central
government had incurred huge debts from operating Shangyi Airport on the
outlying island, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The revised law will also allow airline companies to operate small business
charter flight services to overseas destinations, but they will be required to
use helicopters or aircraft that can carry no more than 19 individuals.</P>
      <P>To offer civil aviation companies easier access to capital, the revised law also
eases restrictions on foreign investment in local commercial flight, air cargo
and ground services. The mandatory ratio of local shareholders will be lowered
from two-thirds of the total to 50 percent, and a single foreign shareholder
will not be allowed to own more than a quarter of the company's shares.</P>
      <P>During a meeting of the Legislative  Yuan's transportation committee Monday,
some lawmakers expressed concern about the possible adverse impact of the
liberalization of private aircraft ownership on domestic  flight safety and
national security.  Civil aviation officials  said  the government  will
formulate  comprehensive regulations to prevent any market disorder or chaos.</P>

      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Monday that a winning strategy for the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to win the 2008 presidential election will be
to seek continued support in southern Taiwan and a breakthrough in northern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Su,  one of the front-runners  among the DPP presidential aspirants, made the
remarks while explaining his ideals on running the country to supporters in a
presentation held at a junior high school in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The premier said that it will be a "daunting task" for the party to win the
presidential election next year, adding that the party will have to cement its
support in southern Taiwan, traditionally the stronghold of the DPP, and seek a
breakthrough in northern Taiwan, which has tilted toward the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) in past elections.</P>
      <P>Su noted that he had previously served as Pingtung County magistrate in southern
Taiwan and Taipei County magistrate in northern Taiwan, making him the best
presidential hopeful who is familiar with Taiwan's situation "from the northern
end to the southern end."</P>
      <P>Su also touted his performance during his two terms as Taipei County magistrate,
saying that the development of Taipei County outstripped that of Taipei City
under then Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who doubled as KMT chairman from 2005
until early this year.</P>
      <P>The premier said that the area and population of Taipei County are both larger
than those of Taipei City, but it has received less funds than Taipei City. He
further said that during his two-term stint, he completed the construction of
Fishermen's Wharf in Tamsui, Pali LeftBank Park, Gold Ecological Park in
Rueifang township, many schools as well as a bicycle lane network.</P>
      <P>He also blasted Ma, who stepped down as KMT chairman in February after being
indicted on charges of embezzlement of public funds during his two terms as
Taipei mayor between 1998 and 2006, for selling the party's "ill-gotten" assets
cheaply. Ma has denied any wrongdoing in the "special allowance fund" case.</P>
      <P>Su also criticized Ma for saying that he would stick to his guns in bidding for
the presidency even if found guilty in the first trial.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HAS NO NEED TO EXPRESS STANCE ON OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY NOW: MAC</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan has no need to say at present whether it agrees to host a leg of the
Olympic torch relay, an official of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Liu Teh-hsun, vice chairman of the nation's body on charting China policy, made
the remarks one day after the news agency AFP cited an official of the Beijing
Olympic Games organizing committee as saying that Taiwan has tentatively agreed
that the torch relay can pass through Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liu denied the claim, saying that "discussions are still ongoing, and we have no
need to publicize our stance now."</P>
      <P>He noted that as a participant in the Olympic Games, "Taiwan naturally wants to
have the honor of taking part in the torch relay."</P>
      <P>However he pointed out that Beijing, after being awarded the right to host the
2008 Olympic Games, said that it would designate Taiwan as part of China's
"domestic" relay route, rather than as part of the international circuit. He
further noted that Beijing has referred to the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee
as "Taipei, China," which he said has "troubled us."</P>
      <P>Liu said that Taiwan has only made "a request as have the other Olympic members,
" which is "to follow the protocol of the Olympic Games." He noted that Taiwan's
government must first consent to allowing the torch relay to pass through
Taiwan, and that one of the conditions of granting consent is that Taiwan's
sovereignty will not be compromised.</P>

      <P>Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Tuesday that the merger of the opposition

issues will have to be discussed and arranged.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks on the sidelines of an international symposium  on
transitional  justice and national reconciliation sponsored by the Taiwan
Foundation for Democracy (TFD) , for which Wang serves as the chairman.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the KMT and the PFP, a splinter party of the KMT, will have to
"meet, talk and make compromises, " saying that such actions will, to a greater
degree, conform to the "political reality."</P>
      <P>The year-end legislative elections will see the introduction of a new "single-
seat  constituency,  two ballots" electoral system, replacing the existing
"single vote, multiple-seat constituency" system. Voters will cast two ballots,
one for their constituency representative and another for their favored
political party.</P>
      <P>The 225-seat legislature will also be halved to 113 members, with 73 seats
elected from regional districts, six seats elected by aboriginal
representatives, and 34 seats for at-large and overseas expatriate
representatives.</P>
      <P>Faced with a streamlined legislature, the competition among the legislative
hopefuls has been especially fierce. Nonetheless, reports have said that the
main opposition KMT is willing to yield some at-large seats to the PFP or the
Non-Partisan Solidarity Union to forge a formidable opposition alliance.</P>
      <P>Asked about the timing for the merge of the opposition parties, Wang said that

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs will announce in the near future a decision to
suspend exports of gravel and sand in order to stabilize domestic supplies and
protect natural resources, MOEA Minister Steve R. L. Chen said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen said the policy to suspend exports was crafted under the frame work of the
Trade Act and will be implemented two months after the date of its announcement
to preempt efforts by other countries to import Taiwanese gravel after China and
Indonesia made the resource relatively more scarce by suspending their gravel
exports.</P>
      <P>Domestic demand for gravel and sand exceeded domestic supply during the period
Jan. 1-April 15 this year, with demand reaching 17.89 million cubic meters but
supplies cresting at 17.39 million cubic meters, Chen said. The shortfall in
supplies was covered by the release of reserves, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Chen said the MOEA has increased the number of gravel mining locations in
operation from eight last year to 39 this year, and will increase the volume of
permitted river gravel dredging to 20 million cubic meters in order to ensure an
adequate domestic supply.</P>
      <P>Domestic gravel prices have risen since the beginning of this year, Chen said,
adding that the MOEA and the Fair Trade Commission will ensure that gravel and
sand are sold at fair prices and step up inspections to guard against price
gouging and hoarding.</P>

      <P>For the first three months of this year, export orders amounted to US$75.88

      <P>In March, the value of export orders for information and communications products
saw the greatest increase, rising US$1.31 billion, or 24.59 percent, year-on-

      <P>The prosecution decided not to indict former main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou over his remarks last year regarding President Chen Shui-
bian amid a presidential recall drive in the legislature, the Taipei Prosecutors
Office said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Prosecutors Office said there was no evidence that Ma had intention
to drive others to commit crimes or to disrupt public order when he claimed in
early June, 2006 that "the gun was loaded" and that "Chen would end up in a foul
death" at a time when lawmakers were to vote on the presidential recall motion.</P>
      <P>The prosecutor in charge of the probe on the case found that Ma's rhetoric was a
means of pushing Chen, whom they described as a "corrupt-ridden" president, to
step down following a February launch of a recall motion by lawmakers of the KMT
and the People First Party.</P>
      <P>A group of Tainan city councilors of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
then lodged a complaint against Ma with the Tainan District Prosecutors Office
in mid-June of the same year, accusing him of "enticing others to conduct
criminal activities by making the remarks."</P>
      <P>But the case was transferred to the Taipei District Prosecutors Office, which
dealt with it as an allegation against public order and never questioned Ma, as
the Article 11 of the Constitution guarantees freedom of speech.</P>
      <P>The Taipei prosecutor responsible for handling the case said that relevant
remarks made by Ma in the print and electronic media showed what Ma meant is
that Chen would lose all public respect -- meaning that he might face the end of
his political career -- if the presidential recall motion were to be approved at
the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>As chief of the main opposition part by that time, Ma had the responsibility of
scrutinizing the government's operations for the sake of public interests,

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 24 (CNA)
04/24/07  18:30:16

    <TEXT>
      <P>Medical professionals urged the government Tuesday to begin to evaluate the
possibility of including several new types of vaccine in the existing state-
financed inoculation program.</P>
      <P>Conveners of the new "Taiwan Vaccine Promotion League", including former
Minister of Health Twu Shing-jer, made the call at a press conference the league
held to publicize their message that the government's preventive inoculation
policy has lagged behind world standards over the past 20 years.</P>
      <P>Twu said Taiwan has not progressed since 1984 when it began to freely inoculate
newborns with a vaccine against hepatitis B. At the time, it was a cutting edge
practice and contributed significantly to Taiwan's efforts to reduce the
prevalence of hepatitis and live cancer, he noted.</P>
      <P>However, since then, the country's preemptive care practices have not improved.
For example,  Twu indicated,  74 countries have introduced a vaccine against
streptococcus pneumoniae since the World Health Organization released an
assessment a few years ago, showing that some 1 million young children aged
under 5 in around the world die of streptococcus pneumoniae (S.P.) infection
every year.</P>
      <P>Seventeen of those nations have even listed inoculation with S.P. vaccine in
their state-funded regular inoculation programs Twu added, noting that in
comparison, Taiwan has thus far been reluctant to follow suit despite of the
fact that drug resistant S.P. infections have  become  common  on the  island
where  antibiotics  are over-prescribed.</P>
      <P>Pediatrician Lee Pin-ying at the National Taiwan University Hospital blamed
ongoing,  "outdated"  practices associated with preventive inoculation on a lack
of funds. Parents of young children must pay for the vaccine against new viruses
or bacteria, he said, arguing if all children enjoyed the right to vote, the
government would have long since offered them free inoculations just as it
provides stipends to the elderly.</P>
      <P>In response to the call, Lin Tung, deputy director of the Center for Disease
Control under the Department of Health (DOH) , admitted that the current level
of funding for regular inoculation is inadequate to include new vaccines, saying
that the central and local governments allocated a total of NT$570 million
(US$17.15 million) for the regular inoculation every year.</P>
      <P>However, the DOH has worked out a medium-term plan in a bid for governmental
funds that includes new types of vaccines like that against new-type whooping
cough and S. P. in the regular inoculation regime for young children, Lin added.</P>
      <P>Types of vaccine in the existing regular inoculation practice for children
include neonatal hepatitis B vaccine, BCG vaccine, the three-in-one vaccine
against diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus, the three-in-one vaccine against
measles, mumps and rubella, the vaccine against Japanese encephalitis, and
polomyelitis oral vaccine.</P>
      <P>Members of the vaccine promotion  league also include Lee Ching-yu, a honorary
professor at the National Taiwan University's Medical Institute, who is known as
the father of vaccine in Taiwan; Lin Chou-yien, president of the Chang Gung
Children's Hospital; Huang Fu-yuan, chairman of the Taiwan Pediatric
Association; and Chuang Tzai-cheng, director of the vaccine center of the
National Health Research Institutes.</P>

      <P>Lin said that initial  investigations  have ruled out the possibility of human
error because the train was traveling through the railway section in question
within the speed limit of 40 km per hour.</P>
      <P>He acknowledged that TRA engineers had examined the points on the railway
section between Tungshan Station and Hsinma Station the previous night, but
added that two subsequent test runs were successful and an additional 11 trains
all passed through the section without incident.</P>
      <P>Lin said a TRA committee in charge of train safety will take over the
investigation to establish the cause of the derailment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CENTRAL WILL NOT DICTATE RULE CHANGE: PARTY OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kuomingtang's (KMT) central committee will not impose a proposed change to
its charter regarding the party's requirements for presidential candidates in
the upcoming national congress, KMT Secretary-General Wu Duen-yih said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wu's remarks came amid rampant rumors that the main opposition KMT is planning
to modify its charter to secure former party chairman Ma Ying-jeou's chances of
taking part in the 2008 presidential election despite being indicted on
corruption charges this February. The KMT charter presently bans party members
convicted in the first trial from running for office.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the KMT is slated to hold the second conference of its 17th
plenary session June 24, at which time party delegates from across the country
will deal with charter revision proposals, including the one pertaining to
presidential candidacy.</P>
      <P>For the KMT, it is a routine to screen proposals to revise the party charter
during its plenary sessions every year, and only qualified party delegates at a
national congress are entitled to decide on changes, he said, adding that a
party task force led by Vice Chairman John C. Kuan is only in charge of
collecting opinions with regard to such issues.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a proposed amendment to the Presidential and Vice Presidential
Election and Recall Law submitted by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) was killed early the same day at the legislative Procedure Committee as a
result of the joint efforts of KMT lawmakers and their counterparts in the
People First Party (PFP).</P>
      <P>The bill, which sought to bar citizens convicted on corruption charges from
participating in presidential elections, was apparently directed at Ma -- widely
assumed to be a strong contender in the 2008 presidential race despite
embezzlement charges against him in a case related to funds from a special
monthly municipal allowance earmarked for his discretionary use when he served
as mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006.</P>
      <P>Along with the so-called "Ma exclusion bill, " another bill initiated by the
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , an ally of the DPP, to demand that the KMT
return its illegally acquired assets to the national coffers was also blocked.</P>
      <P>The two draft amendments could pose major setbacks to the main opposition KMT's
quest to take back power in the next presidential election. Against that back
drop, the KMT needs PFP cooperation to prevent the proposals from clearing the
committee for further reading.</P>
      <P>PFP and KMT lawmakers vetoed the two bills in a concerted move in Tuesday's
committee session after the two parties inked a 7-point pledge late last week
regarding cooperation in December's legislative elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SIMULATED WARFARE DRILLS TARGET CHINESE MILITARY: MND</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Officers of the Ministry of National Defense (MND)  confirmed Tuesday that the
MND's just-concluded simulated computerized warfare drills targeted the Chinese
military with missiles in counterattacking a mock surprise assault by China.</P>
      <P>The five-day computerized warfare simulation formed part of the large-scale
combined forces' "Han Kuang" military exercises which are conducted by the MND
annually.</P>
      <P>At a press conference held at the MND, Hsu Tai-sheng, director of MND's Joint
Operation Training and Doctrine Office, stressed that the the five-day
computerized warfare simulation, which began April 16, only targeted Chinese
military objectives and none of its civilian installations.</P>
      <P>According to MND officers, the computerized warfare simulated a situation in
which China attacks Taiwan's warfare command centers, radar stations and missile
bases with high-calibre weapons in 2012, then makes a land assault on the island
after weakening Taiwan's air and marine combat ability.</P>
      <P>In mock counterattacks, Taiwan's troops struck Chinese military targets with
missiles,  including airports,  missile bases and observation and
telecommunications installations.</P>
      <P>However, the MND did not elaborate what kinds of missiles they were using in the
warfare simulation as the officials classified them as confidential.</P>
      <P>MND's spokesman Wu Chi-fang noted that the computerized warfare drills only
focused on the attacking and defensive sides, and did not include an
intervention by the United States. According to Wu, the U.S. military
observation delegation, which was here to observe the process, expressed
satisfaction regarding the content of the MND's computerized mock drills.</P>
      <P>However, Chiu Kuo-cheng, a deputy chief of MND in charge of warfare planning,
admitted that the warfare simulation also reflected Taiwan's serious weakness in
its anti-missile and anti-submarine measures, which allowed the island's
airports, radar stations and missile bases on the west coast to be seriously
damaged by Chinese missiles in the simulated warfare, and China's superiority in
the number of submarines also posed a serious threat to the security of the
island.</P>
      <P>A MND report said the experience obtained in the computerized warfare simulation
will serve as valuable references for Taiwan's military preparedness in the
future, but Taiwan's apparent inferior anti-missile and anti-submarine combat
ability represent another urgent matter that the nation's military forces should
face.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) urged Taiwan people Tuesday to enter
Japan on proper visas, despite the fact that Japan offers visa-free privileges
to Taiwan tourists.</P>
      <P>According MOFA officials, not all Taiwan people are allowed to enter Japan
without a visa. The visa-free treatment is limited to tourists, businessmen,
people visiting families or friends and those attending seminars.</P>
      <P>Those entering Japan for other reasons, such as attending language schools or
engaging in "money-making activities, " including artistic performances, still
need to apply for entry visas, MOFA officials said, adding that Taiwan people
are not allowed to freely enter or leave Japan with only passports and airplane
tickets.</P>
      <P>The number  of Taiwan  people  denied  entry  by Japanese immigration officials
has been on the rise recently after Tokyo announced visa-free treatment for
Taiwanese tourists in September 2005, the officials said.</P>
      <P>In 2006, 942 people from Taiwan were denied entry upon arrival at Japanese
airports, most of whom were suspected by the Japanese authorities as intending
to engage in other activities not compatible with tourism, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Some were also denied entry because they have criminal records and had
overstayed their visas in Japan or held fake passports, or because they failed
to clearly explain the purpose of their visit, they added.</P>

      <P>Several civil social welfare organizations Tuesday urged the ruling and
opposition parties not to propose unrealistic raises in stipend paid to the
elderly as the approach of the year-end legislative election and the 2008
presidential election.</P>
      <P>The civil groups, including the Parents' Association for Persons with
Intellectual Disabilities, the League of Welfare Organizations for Disabled, the
League of Welfare Improvement for Older People (LWIOP) , and the Taiwan
Association of Family Caregivers, held a joint press conference to release their
statements and criticized some politicians for attempting to "buy votes" through
raising the dollars attached to various existing stipend programs.</P>
      <P>The legislative committees of health, environment and social welfare have
decided to screen the existing provisional regulations on welfare subsidies to
the elderly Wednesday. It is said that lawmakers have prepared 25 different
versions of amendment proposals, all aimed at increasing the elderly's stipend,
with some suggesting a raise from the current NT$3,000 (US$90) to NT$4,000,
NT$6,000 or even NT$10,000.</P>
      <P>Whenever there is an election, there are politicians ready to write checks for
those persons who are socially less privileged in an attempt to buy their votes,
criticized LWIOP Secretary-General Wu Yu-chin.</P>
      <P>But social welfare services can't be confined to the practice of offering
stipends, Wu said, noting cash cannot improve people's life, but that can be
accomplished given a sound, healthy social welfare system.</P>
      <P>While over 90 percent of the government's current social welfare budget is spent
covering various kinds of stipend programs, the groups urged ruling and
opposition parties to respect the conclusion of the 2006 national conference on
sustaining Taiwan's economic development and forgo inflating existing social
welfare stipend programs  until the long-planned  national  pension program is
implemented.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Scores of representatives of travel service operators rallied in front of the
Tourism Bureau Tuesday to protest what they called "unreasonable restrictions
placed on hosting Chinese tourists."</P>
      <P>They said that the requirement that operators spend no less than US$80 daily for
each member of a Chinese tourist group should be lifted.</P>
      <P>The protest came one day after the Tourism Bureau slapped a fine of NT$60,000
(US$1,820) on a local travel agent for failing to provide minimum quality
service to a group of Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>The MarcoPolo Travel Service was fined because it had arranged for the tourists
to stay at a substandard hotel in central Taiwan, leading to one of the tourists
being bitten by a rat.</P>
      <P>The protestors are also angry that the Travel Agent Association of the R.O.C.
Taiwan is in charge of screening the hosting arrangements of travel agents; the
requirement that local travel agents post a NT$2 million bond with the
association is similarly unpopular, and the association has requested that the
government handle the screening procedures.</P>
      <P>The requirement that travel agencies which have not been established for five
years old not host Chinese tourist groups should also be scrapped, they
demanded.</P>
      <P>Tourism  Bureau Deputy Director-general  Su Tsang-yang,  in receiving the
protestors, said that requiring minimum expenditures for each member of Chinese
groups is aimed at ensuring quality service, and asked for the understanding of
travel service operators.</P>
      <P>Su also urged the Travel Agent Association to be fair when screening the
itineraries travel service operators must submit to host Chinese tour groups in
order to a avoid conflict of interest.</P>
      <P>The protestors later went to the Legislative Yuan to make their grievances
heard.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau, in anticipation of a rush of Chinese tourists to Taiwan on
sightseeing tours, promoted a quality control campaign with travel service
operators last November. The campaign calls for travel operators to promise to
spend no less than US$80 daily for each member of a Chinese tourist group,
requires that the age of tour buses used by Chinese tourist groups not exceed
seven years, and that there be no self-pay tours during the journey.</P>
      <P>The campaign came one month after a major traffic incident involving Chinese
tourists which left six dead, including s Taiwanese tour guide, and 15 injured.</P>
      <P>The tourists from Dalian in Liaoning Province were en route to Shuili from
Tungpu in central Nantou County when one of the two buses they were traveling in
skidded off the Central Cross-Island Highway and plunged into a ravine.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that he asked the Ministry of Justice
(MOJ) last week to work out a plan to grant sentence commutations to prison
inmates.</P>
      <P>Noting that the previous commutation was meted out 16 years ago to celebrate the
80th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China, the president said
another commutation is appropriate for this year as it is the 20th anniversary
of the lifting of martial law and the 60th anniversary of the 228 Incident.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident refers to a revolt of local people against the government in
1947 during which many were killed in an ensuing government crackdown.</P>
      <P>Chen made the announcement during a meeting with visiting Archbishop Emeritus of

      <P>National reconciliation of a democracy emerging from dictatorship lies in the
acknowledgement by the perpetrators for past cruelty and the forgiveness of
their victims, visiting Archbishop Emeritus of Cape Town Desmond Mpilo Tutu said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a symposium organized by the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy, Tutu,
who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984, said reconciliation is a long process in
which every citizen, in addition to the victims and perpetrators, should be
involved.</P>
      <P>The former chief of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, who was
invited by the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy to offer his advice on Taiwan's
search for transitional justice and national reconciliation, said he has no
ready answer for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said he was surprised by the keen desire of Taiwan to come to terms with its
past, but just as each of the other 20-some countries in the world that have
emerged from the shadows of their past dictatorships, Taiwan has to grope for
its own way out of its historical dilemma.</P>
      <P>However, Tutu said his country's experience in healing the rift caused by
apartheid may shed light on the way ahead for Taiwan and may serve as a catalyst
for reconciliation.</P>
      <P>After the end of apartheid in South Africa, Tutu said, his country faced calls
to put those who perpetrated crimes under the cover of apartheid on trial,
similar to the war criminals tried at Nuremberg after World War Two.</P>
      <P>However, there were also calls for a general amnesty to all perpetrators and for
the country forget about the past and move on, Tutu said.</P>
      <P>The Truth and Reconciliation Commission headed by Tutu opted for another way,
offering pardons only to perpetrators who confessed their crimes and apologized
to the victims in public hearings.</P>
      <P>In this way, Tutu said, old wounds were reopened, treated and bandaged again,
and South Africa avoided a division between its people.</P>
      <P>Wu Naiteh, a research fellow at Academia Sinica, echoed Tutu's opinion in the
symposium by calling for tolerance on behalf of the victims toward their
persecutors, which he said is the key to national reconciliation.</P>
      <P>Tutu, who arrived April 18, will wrap up his visit Wednesday.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Democrats Back Date for Start of Iraq Pullout

Congressional Democrats agreed Monday to ignore President Bushs veto threat and
send him a $124 billion war spending bill that orders the administration to
begin pulling troops out of Iraq by Oct. 1.

On Iraq, the American people want a new direction, and we are providing it, said
Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, a leader of the Congressional
negotiators who came to terms on the legislation that has become a test of wills
between Mr. Bush and the Democratic majority on Capitol Hill.

Wall Street Journal:How an Email Rant Jolted a Big HMO

On a Friday morning last November, Justen Deal, a 22-year-old Kaiser Permanente
employee here, blasted an email throughout the giant health maintenance
organization. His message charged that HealthConnect -- the company's ambitious
$4 billion project to convert paper files into electronic medical records -- was
a mess.

In a blistering 2,000-word treatise, Mr. Deal wrote: "We're spending recklessly,
to the tune of over $1.5 billion in waste every year, primarily on
HealthConnect, but also on other inefficient and ineffective information
technology projects." He did not stop there. Mr. Deal cited what he called the
"misleadership" of Kaiser Chief Executive George Halvorson and other top
managers, who he said were jeopardizing the company's ability to provide quality
care.</TEXT>

      <P>National reconciliation of a democracy emerging from dictatorship lies in the
acknowledgement by the perpetrators for past cruelty and the forgiveness of
their victims, visiting Archbishop Emeritus of Cape Town Desmond Mpilo Tutu said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a symposium organized by the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy, Tutu,
who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984, said reconciliation is a long process in
which every citizen, in addition to the victims and perpetrators, should be
involved.</P>
      <P>The former chief of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, who was
invited by the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy to offer his advice on Taiwan's
search for transitional justice and national reconciliation, said he has no
ready answer for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said he was surprised by the keen desire of Taiwan to come to terms with its
past, but just as each of the other 20-some countries in the world that have
emerged from the shadows of their past dictatorships, Taiwan has to grope for
its own way out of its historical dilemma.</P>
      <P>However, Tutu said his country's experience in healing the rift caused by
apartheid may shed light on the way ahead for Taiwan and may serve as a catalyst
for reconciliation.</P>
      <P>After the end of apartheid in South Africa, Tutu said, his country faced calls
to put those who perpetrated crimes under the cover of apartheid on trial,
similar to the war criminals tried at Nuremberg after World War Two.</P>
      <P>However, there were also calls for a general amnesty to all perpetrators and for
the country forget about the past and move on, Tutu said.</P>
      <P>The Truth and Reconciliation Commission headed by Tutu opted for another way,
offering pardons only to perpetrators who confessed their crimes and apologized
to the victims in public hearings.</P>
      <P>In this way, Tutu said, old wounds were reopened, treated and bandaged again,
and South Africa avoided a division between its people.</P>
      <P>Wu Naiteh, a research fellow at Academia Sinica, echoed Tutu's opinion in the
symposium by calling for tolerance on behalf of the victims toward their
persecutors, which he said is the key to national reconciliation.</P>
      <P>Tutu, who arrived April 18, will wrap up his visit Wednesday.</P>

(By Ruth Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that he asked the Ministry of Justice
(MOJ) last week to work out a plan to grant sentence commutations to prison
inmates.</P>
      <P>Noting that the previous commutation was meted out 16 years ago to celebrate the
80th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China, the president said
another commutation is appropriate for this year as it is the 20th anniversary
of the lifting of martial law and the 60th anniversary of the 228 Incident.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident refers to a revolt of local people against the government in
1947 during which many were killed in an ensuing government crackdown.</P>
      <P>Chen made the announcement during a meeting with visiting Archbishop Emeritus of
Cape Town Desmond Mpilo Tutu at his office.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Justice Minister Lee Chin-yung said that his ministry is working
on a draft of a punishment reduction bill in line with Chen's instruction to
commute some sentences this year.</P>
      <P>Lee said the MOE's Department of Prosecutorial Affairs has organized meetings
with the Judicial Yuan, the National Police Agency, the Investigation Bureau,
the Taiwan High Prosecutor's Office and military legal authorities to work on
the draft that will be sent to the Executive Yuan next week for approval.</P>
      <P>The draft, Lee said, will neither cover criminals who committed serious crimes
nor be applied to people who committed serious financial crimes after 1991.</P>
      <P>Quoting Article 40 of the Constitution of the Republic of China, Lee said the
president has the power to grant amnesties, pardon, cut sentences and reinstate
civil rights in accordance with the law. Taiwan has granted four general
commutations since the promulgation of the Constitution in 1947, he added.</P>

      <P>Former South African Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who won the 1984 Nobel
Peace Prize, departed Taiwan Wednesday after an eight-day visit to the island.</P>
      <P>At the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, Tutu expressed his thanks for the
Taiwan people's hospitality and gave them his blessing.</P>
      <P>Tutu, in the company of his wife, Leah Nomalizo Tutu, arrived in Taiwan April 18
for a visit at the invitation of the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy. During his
stay, he met with President Chen Shui-bian, Vice President Annette Lu, former
ruling Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung, and family members
of the victims of the 228 Incident of 1947, one of the most tragic chapters in
Taiwan's history.</P>
      <P>Tutu also attended a forum held by the foundation Tuesday on the subject of
transitional justice and national reconciliation.</P>
      <P>Tutu said that Taiwan is in a situation similar to that of South Africa during
apartheid. In those days, he recalled, it was difficult for him to obtain a visa
with a South African passport.</P>
      <P>Nowadays, the Taiwan people's rights and interests are still ignored by the
international community, Tutu said, adding that he will speak up for Taiwan at
gatherings  of any international organizations when the opportunity presents
itself.</P>
      <P>Tutu, rising to worldwide fame during the 1980s as an opponent of apartheid, is
recognized for his contribution to ending the inhumane system and facilitating

wounds and boost ethnic harmony.</P>

      <P>A high-ranking U.S. military official reaffirmed Tuesday the United States'
commitment to provide Taiwan with the necessary assistance to defend itself
against possible Chinese invasion.</P>
      <P>The United States is examining Taiwan's defense needs by sending observers  to
survey the island's annual "Han Kuang" military exercise, according to Timothy
Keating, commander of the U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM).</P>
      <P>"USPACOM will continue to make available to Taiwan advice, training and support
for congressionally-approved equipment to defend against the potential military
aggression by the PRC, " Keating said during a Senate Committee on Armed
Services hearing.</P>
      <P>He said the United States is monitoring cross-Taiwan Strait relations closely
and that the country's military interactions with Taiwan and China focus on
efforts to preserve cross-strait stability.</P>
      <P>"We continue to encourage Taiwan to improve its own defenses and create a
credible deterrent to any attack. We have advocated inexpensive hardening
practices as well as the acquisition of a combination of defensive weapons and
systems," he said.</P>
      <P>However, Keating emphasized the United States' position remains that Taiwan's
actions should be defensive, rather than offensive, in nature, and he expressed
confidence that Taiwan understands this point clearly.</P>
      <P>"But it is very much in their interest not to conduct themselves, either by
speech or by action, in a way that could be misconstrued by China in unfortunate
ways," he said.</P>
      <P>Keating said that while China's military modernization efforts do not yet
challenge U.S. military capabilities in the Asia-Pacific region, the opaqueness
of Chinese defense budgets and intentions, as well as the introduction of new
capabilities, are causes for concern.</P>
      <P>The military-to-military interaction between the United States and China is
aimed at increasing  transparency  between their respective militaries, breaking
down barriers to understanding and reducing the potential for miscalculation, he
said.</P>

    <TEXT>: The Straits Times: MM expects growth to hit top end of 4.5- 6.5% forecast.

Singapore's economy is likely to grow at the top end of the official 4.5 to 6.5
per cent growth estimate this year, as long as the United States economy holds
up, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew said yesterday.

The Lianhe Zaobao: Extradition treaty won't harm Singapore's economy: MM Lee.

The agreement between Singapore and Indonesia to sign an extradition treaty will
not scare wealthy Indonesians away from Singapore, nor will the pact harm the
Republic's banking and property sectors.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>NEW ROC ENVOY TO U.S. SOLICITS SUPPORT FOR TAIWAN'S WHO BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 24 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's new representative to the United States, Joseph Wu, paid a courtesy
call on Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), a co-chair of the U.S. Congress Taiwan
Caucus, Tuesday to solicit  support  for Taiwan's  bid to join the World Health
Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>Wu, who formally assumed his post in Washington, D.C. April 16, first  conveyed
President  Chen  Shui-bian's  appreciation  to Taiwan-friendly members of
Congress, particularly Rohrabacher and three other Taiwan  Caucus co-chairs,
for their staunch  and longstanding support for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu said that despite the United States' support, Taiwan's WHO bid has made
little progress over the past 10 years due to China's obstruction, adding that
even in its efforts to join the World Health Assembly (WHA) as an observer have
failed.</P>
      <P>He further said that Taiwan is adopting a new strategy this year for a change --
preparing to apply directly to join the WHO as a full member under the name
"Taiwan" -- to let the international community know that the 23 million people
of Taiwan have the right to join the world health regulatory body.</P>
      <P>For his part, Rohrabacher said he understands that Taiwan and the People's
Republic of China are two different countries and that Taiwan deserves more
positive  treatment  in the international community.</P>
      <P>Rohrabacher said that Taiwan, which has made more contributions to WHO efforts
than China has, deserves fairer treatment, adding that he will relentlessly work
to help Taiwan gain entry into the WHO as a full member.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Rohrabacher also expressed his hope and the set policy of the U.S.
administration that Taiwan will maintain more direct contact with the Chinese
people in efforts to sell Taiwan's democracy in China and thus help change the
Chinese people's mindset and vision.</P>
      <P>Wu responded that he had made strenuous efforts during his stint as the chairman
of the Mainland Affairs Council -- Taiwan's top China policy planning agency --
to let the Chinese people better understand Taiwan's democratization, including
the freedom of speech and the freedom that Taiwan media outlets have enjoyed, by
inviting media members, scholars and even officials from China and Hong Kong to
visit Taiwan in person.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu also appealed to the U.S. Congress for its support for Taiwan's
bid to sign a free trade agreement (FTA) with the United States to better
facilitate business and trade exchanges between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Wu stressed that the U.S.-South Korea FTA, signed earlier this month, has put
Taiwan at a disadvantage and that it will undermine its economic development as
South Korea is a major rival of Taiwan's in terms of foreign trade.</P>
      <P>For his part, Rohrabacher said that he will continue to push for the signing of
a U.S-Taiwan FTA since he has always advocated that it is only natural that free
countries forge free trade pacts among themselves.</P>
      <P>Rohrabacher, however, added that he is afraid he cannot be too optimistic at
present on this issue under the current circumstances in which the United States
needs to curry favor with China for its support on the North Korea issue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'CHINESE SPIES' ARE ACTUALLY ESCAPED ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS: NSB</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The "5,000 Chinese spies" alleged to be operating in Taiwan are actually
"escaped illegal immigrants," rather than "genuine" spies, a National Security
Bureau (NSB) official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang Hsi-tien, a deputy secretary-general of the NSB, said during an
interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan that there are roughly 5,000
Chinese citizens who have been living a clandestine existence in Taiwan since
entering the country illegally.</P>
      <P>Wang said the figure of "5,000" was arrived at based on cumulative calculations
over the past several years, stressing that these illegal immigrants are not
spies.</P>
      <P>The NSB official made the remarks in response to a question raised by opposition
Kuomintang Legislator Lin Yu-fang about whether former Deputy Defense Minister
Lin Chong-pin's recent claim that there are more than 5,000 Chinese spies
operating in Taiwan is true.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin was quoted in the latest edition of the U.S. weekly "Defense News"
as saying that he believes more than 5,000 mainland Chinese spies are operating
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin was also quoted as saying in the weekly report that he himself had
stumbled upon one "Chinese spy" who was working as a cab driver in Taiwan in
1995. He said the driver spoke in perfect Pekingese and admitted that he was
from Beijing, that he had been briefed by the Taiwan Research Institute
(affiliated with the People's Republic of China's National Security Ministry),
that he had a master's degree in hydraulic dynamics from Tsinghua University,
and that he was in Taiwan to 'serve the broad masses by comparing the strengths
and weaknesses  between the capitalist and socialist systems."</P>
      <P>When asked by Legislator Lin Yu-fang whether it was possible that Chinese
authorities, unable to send spies to Taiwan from Xiamen, Fujian Province --
which lies across the Taiwan Strait from Taiwan, had decided to send spies from
Beijing, Wang responded by saying that if he were a Chinese official in charge
of espionage work, he would have sent spies from Fujian Province, rather than
from Beijing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT URGED TO MORE ACTIVE IN CUTTING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior researcher at the Academia Sinica urged the government Wednesday to be
more active in working to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions in
Taiwan, as the country's image has been deteriorating in the international
community due to what he called the record-high rate of increase of such
emissions in the country in recent years.</P>
      <P>Liu Shaw-chen, chief of the Academia Sinica's Research Center for Environmental
Change, made the call while delivering a report on Taiwan's preparations against
climate change and global warming at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Liu indicated that Taiwan's per capita greenhouse gas emissions is now double
the level in 1990.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of a survey on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions
produced in countries with over 10 million people, Liu said Taiwan's per capita
carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions was half those of France and Britain in 1990.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan surpassed the industrialized European nations in 2003 in terms
of per capita CO2 emissions, Liu said. He added that although Taiwan's per
capita CO2 emissions is lower than those of the United States, Canada and
Australia, Taiwan tops the global list in terms of the rate of increase in
greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      <P>"Because  of this,  Taiwan's international  image is being tarnished, " Liu
claimed.</P>
      <P>The scientist stressed that Taiwan possesses the technological know-how to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, adding that he believes it is the government's
duty to strive to do so.</P>

      <P>Taiwan would have to fight on its own for the first 10 to 14 days in the event
of a large-scale military attack by China, a National Security Bureau (NSB)
official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The estimate is based on the presumption that the United States would provide
military support to Taiwan, according to NSB deputy chief Wang Hsi-tien.</P>
      <P>Wang said that while the United States is expected to intervene in the event of

warfare simulation held recently by the military as part of the country's annual
"Han Kuang" military exercise.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, Timothy Keating, commander of the U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM) ,

      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang  expressed opposition Wednesday to "pork barrel" draft
bills that have been put forth by individual legislators or legislative caucuses
of political parties.</P>
      <P>At a regular Executive Yuan meeting, Su instructed Cabinet agencies to stay firm
on carrying out government policies but to do their utmost to consult and
communicate  with members of the legislature in the face of "pork barrel" draft
bills.</P>
      <P>Su said these draft bills -- projects that are given a lot of government money
in order to win votes -- should be avoided, as they will have a profound and
longstanding impact on the nation's finances.</P>
      <P>Su issued  the instruction  after  the opposition-dominated Legislative Health
and Environment Committee passed 23 amendments to a law governing higher annuity
payments for the elderly. The committee meeting decided later that the ruling
and opposition parties should consult with each other and negotiate before
referring final amendment proposals to the legislative floor for debate.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Su lamented that the legislature has passed only 30 bills so far this
legislative session, with 90 other "priority" draft bills submitted by the
Executive Yuan remaining up in the air. The session is scheduled to wrap up May

    <HEADLINE>MURDERERS, MAJOR FINANCIAL CRIMINALS TO BE EXCLUDED FROM AMNESTY: MOJ</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) said Wednesday that prison inmates serving
sentences for murder or major financial crimes will not be included in a
presidential amnesty now being studied by the ministry.</P>
      <P>Vice Justice Minister Lee Chin-yung made the remarks one day after President
Chen Shui-bian said he had instructed the Executive Yuan to study commuting some
sentences to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the lifting of martial law
and the 60th anniversary of the 228 Incident, which refers to a civilian revolt
against the then corrupt government in 1947 that led to a bloody crackdown.</P>
      <P>Lee said that under a draft bill planned by the ministry, those who are eligible
for sentence commutation will be fewer than in past sentence reductions.</P>
      <P>To carry out a carrot-and-stick policy as espoused by the president, those who
have seriously damaged national and social interests will not see their
sentences commuted, but those who have committed minor transgressions and are
serving short prison terms will be given the chance of a fresh start, he said.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out those who are convicted for corruption or major financial
crimes, and those have sexually assaulted children or have murdered people will
be excluded from the plan.</P>
      <P>He also said that the ministry will continue to keep track of the inmates
released after commutation.</P>
      <P>Asked if he is concerned about law and order after the exodus of inmates under
the amnesty, Lee cited a previous amnesty in 1991 as an example.</P>
      <P>He noted that between 1991 and 2000, the recidivism ratio of imnates who were
released earlier after commutation was only 16.21 percent compared with the
recidivism ratio of 49.9 percent of prisoners who completed their terms and the
recidivism ratio of 50.7 percent for those who were released on parole between
1996 and 2006.</P>
      <P>The government granted amnesties in 1971 and 1991 to mark the 60th and 80th
founding anniversary of the nation, respectively. Two other pardons were granted
in 1975 and 1988 to mark the deaths of the two late presidents -- Chiang Kai-
shek and Chiang Ching-kuo.</P>

      <P>A top official of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) accused the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Wednesday of having "lured" TSU elite
to join the DPP in a scheme to enlarge the DPP support base so that the party
can win in the year-end legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Unhappy with "constant" moves that the DPP have made to lure TSU members, TSU
Secretary-General Chien Cheng-shan said the DPP's "stealthy" actions have
damaged the harmony between the two parties.</P>
      <P>"The DPP should take all the responsibility should DPP-TSU consultation and
negotiation on the legislative elections fail, " Chien said.</P>
      <P>Chien said the TSU -- an ally of the DPP -- and the DPP have reached a consensus
that the two parties will cooperate in order to garner the greatest possible
victory for the "pan green camp" in the legislative elections slated for
December this year.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chien noted, even before the two parties have begun to talk, the
DPP has "cut the ground from under the TSU's feet" by luring away one more of
the TSU elite.</P>
      <P>Even DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun traveled south Tuesday to Yunlin to witness a
ceremony  marking former TSU County Councilor  Liao Ching-hsiang's joining of
the DPP, Chien noted. Liao quit the TSU several days ago.</P>
      <P>Chien said the TSU condemns the DPP's "unfriendly" action in the strongest

23 amendment  proposals targeting provisional regulations on welfare stipends
for the elderly Wednesday, despite strong opposition from several social welfare

      <P>Nine of the controversial amendment bills focus on a raise in the stipend, with
some proposals suggesting a boost in the amount from the present NT$3,000
(US$90) per month to NT$4,000, NT$5,000, NT$6,000, or even NT$10,000.</P>

repeated issuance of various stipends, as well as a provision that excludes rich

      <P>A Web site run by the Executive Yuan aimed at allowing the public to gain an
understanding of the government's efforts to recover the main opposition
Kuomintang's (KMT's) illegally or improperly acquired assets was launched
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang presided over the opening of the Web site following an
Executive Yuan weekly meeting earlier in the day, during which Su was briefed by
officials from the Ministry of Finance and the Research, Development, and
Evaluation Commission (RDEC). Minister without Portfolio  Hsu Chih-hsiung,
Finance Vice Minister Lee Ruey-tsang and RDEC Vice Chairman Chen Chun-lin were
also present.</P>
      <P>Su called on the public to support the government's drive to make the KMT return
its ill-gotten assets to serve transitional justice and encouraged the public to
visit the site at http//igpa.nat.gov.tw.</P>
      <P>According to Su, an Executive Yuan task force has been working on the issue
since late August last year, and then-KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou promised to
provide the public with a detailed explanation of how the party has dealt with
its property and land plots. But Ma failed to honor his pledge and in turn sold
much of the KMT assets in a short time, he said.</P>
      <P>The KMT still has assets worth more than NT$45 billion registered under its
name, but the actual value far exceeds this figure, Su said, describing the KMT
as "the world's wealthiest political party."</P>
      <P>The government's efforts to recover the KMT's assets can be dated back to 2001,
when the Control Yuan, Taiwan's highest government watchdog agency, requested
that the issue be addressed, Su said, adding that a bill initiated by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) serving that end has been stonewalled in the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, the Executive Yuan has since the 2000 power transfer been
tracking the KMT's assets -- a complicated task that he called "very difficult"
due to the fact that the opposition "pan-blue alliance" controls a majority in
the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>However, Hsu pointed out, the DPP administration will continue pursuing the goal
and plans to sponsor a series of seminars in August across the country to delve
into the issue.</P>
      <P>Finance Vice Minister Lee brushed aside allegations that the Executive Yuan's
efforts in this regard are aimed at seeking voter support in the coming
elections, describing the rhetoric as a smear tactic. The public now has a sense

      <P>A preliminary draft of a national sentence commutation act will benefit more
than 10,000 prison inmates, Vice Justice Minister Lee Chin-yung said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The preliminary plan of the national amnesty legislation, in line with President
Chen Shui-bian's directive last week, will only commute sentences for criminals
serving time for crimes committed before a certain date, Lee said, adding that
the date will be decided by the MOJ.</P>
      <P>The draft of the national amnesty will not include criminals convicted of
serious crimes and crimes that endanger society, Lee said, adding that crimes
against the Prevention and Punishment of Sex-Trade Act and special financial
crimes will be excluded.</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) caucus whip Ker Chien-ming said the draft
will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval before being sent for
deliberation by the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Kao Yung-cheng, the executive director of the Judicial Reform Foundation, said
he is not against the amnesty or commutation as it is allowed by the
Constitution. However, he went on, an amnesty on death-row inmates is a better
way to show the DPP's political ideal o f a nation built upon the principles of
human rights.</P>
      <P>Vice Chairman of the International Federation for Human Rights Siobhan Ni
Chulachain has requested an amnesty for prisoners on death row, but has received
no response from the government, Kao said.</P>

      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will divest itself of all its shares in the
Central Investment Holding Co. -- the last KMT-owned enterprise still in its
possession -- by the end of June, a senior KMT official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>KMT Deputy Secretary-General Chang Che-shen claimed at a press conference that
although quite a few potential buyers had expressed interest in acquiring the
company, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government "scared them off
through intimidation tactics."</P>
      <P>The Cabinet and the DPP have been mustering support from voters for a referendum
to be held alongside the next election on whether the KMT should give its "ill-
gotten" assets to the national coffers.</P>
      <P>Chang, who is also director-general of the KMT Administration and Management
Committee and chairman of Central Investment Holding, claimed that the DPP and
the government do not really want to see the KMT resolve its party assets
problems because it would give them a good excuse to assault the KMT and win
votes in this year's elections.</P>
      <P>The KMT will try to find buyers for its shares in Central Investment Holding
within the next two months, Chang said, adding that after it gets rid of the
company, the KMT will no longer own or operate any businesses.</P>
      <P>Central Investment Holding was established in 1971 and became an open company in
1995, with capital totaling NT$34.9 billion (US$1.04 billion).</P>
      <P>The KMT has denied that its assets are "ill-gotten" and insists that its total
assets as of the end of 1999 totaled only NT$69.6 billion, not the NT$600
billion claimed by the DPP.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) warned Wednesday that Taiwan businessmen
should think about the risks of focusing too much on the China market.</P>
      <P>Liu Te-hsun, vice chairman of the body in charge of Taiwan's China policy
planning, made the remarks during a meeting in the central city of Taichung with
300 Taiwanese businessmen wanting to invest or having invested in China.</P>
      <P>Liu noted that in recent years, Taiwan businessmen have listed China as their
main investment destination or the major market for their products instead of
diverting their investments and exports to other countries.</P>
      <P>"Focusing on a single market has potential risks, " Liu said, adding that Taiwan
businessmen should seriously consider the negative impact of such a move.</P>
      <P>Businessman Lee Jung-fu, speaking on the same occasion, said China no longer
welcomes all enterprises. Those enterprises that are highly polluting and high-
energy consuming might be told to move to China's hinterland instead of staying
in the more prosperous coastal provinces, he said.</P>
      <P>Labor-intensive enterprises are no longer suitable for investing in China and
Taiwan businessmen should take heed of this trend, Lee added.</P>
      <P>He said that the digital  and service sectors still have development
opportunities in China, although they will be hard to develop if they are small-
scale.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislative caucus convener said
Wednesday that a proposed sentence commutation  plan should not be applicable to
former Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and People First Party (PFP)
Legislator Chiu Yi because they committed major crimes.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming made the remarks after President Chen Shui-bian instructed the
Ministry of Justice (MOJ) last week to study the feasibility of a national
commutation of sentences or partial amnesty for prison inmates.</P>
      <P>The proposal is aimed at commuting sentences for those who committed minor
crimes and who have shown remorse, Ker said, adding that as Chiu is a violent
criminal and shows no repentance, he is not eligible for a sentence reduction.</P>
      <P>Chiu Yi was sentenced to 14 months in prison for his leading role in a violent
demonstration in the southern port city of Kaohsiung after the 2004 presidential
election in which the joint KMT-PFP ticket lost by a razor-thin margin.</P>
      <P>As for Ma, who has not been convicted of any offense, Ker said he has been
indicted for allegedly siphoning funds from his special allowance fund when he
was mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006. Embezzling public funds is not a minor
crime, Ker added.</P>
      <P>On whether the commutation proposal will be written into law before the May 20
anniversary  of President  Chen Shui-bian's inauguration, Ker said it cannot be
made that soon, as a draft of the sentence reduction bill should first be drawn
up by the MOJ, followed by approval by the Executive Yuan and the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>Ker added that the proposal is a response to calls from human right groups,
legislators across political spectrum and grassroots representatives. Prison
overpopulation is also a factor, he added.</P>
      <P>As most provisions in the existing commutation statute are outdated, Ker said a
new set of rules should be enacted to prescribe targets and qualifications for
commutation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT URGES GERMANY TO SUPPORT TAIWAN'S WHO BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 25 (CNA)
04/25/07  20:17:40

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian called on the German government Wednesday to speak up
on behalf of Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Organization (WHO) , a goal
which has remained unfulfilled over the past 10 years owing to China's
obstruction.</P>
      <P>Addressing the issue during video conference with a group of German politicians,
academics and media representatives, Chen suggested that Germany make a case for
Taiwan during the upcoming annual World Health Assembly (WHA) -- the highest
decision-making body of the WHO -- based on the precedent of the former East
Germany.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that the status of East Germany as a "country" was challenged
when it applied to become a member of the WHO in 1968, but the request was
nonetheless included on the WHA's agenda for consideration by the organization's
member nations.</P>
      <P>The WHO invited East Germany to participate in the 1972 WHA as an observer, and
during the 1973 WHA, East Germany's application for WHO membership was approved,
Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Chen said he requested that Taiwan be allowed to become a member of the WHO in a
letter addressed to WHO Director-General Margaret Chan April 11, and hopes that
Germany will offer Taiwan its support so that the country's application could be
put on the WHA's agenda and be discussed by WHO member nations.</P>
      <P>Also, Taiwan hopes that Germany will help Taiwan take part in the WHA as an
observer before it gains membership in the WHO, Chen said.</P>
      <P>"I hereby sincerely urge the international community, especially European Union
countries, to pay attention to China's diplomatic suppression and military
intimidation of Taiwan, and speak up for Taiwan so as to promote the values of
freedom, democracy, peace and human rights that we share," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president said China's obstruction of Taiwan's bid to take part in the WHO
has deprived the island's 23 million people of their rights to life and health.</P>
      <P>While China has never renounced the use of force against Taiwan and has been
increasing its military budget over last 20 years, there is no collective
security mechanism or platform for dialogue that would allow for international
mediation of cross-Taiwan Strait disputes, Chen pointed out.</P>
      <P>"It is extremely unfair to the 23 million Taiwanese people that Taiwan must face
the increasingly strong military threat by China. This also poses a latent
hazard to the security and stability of the Asia-Pacific region," he said.</P>
      <P>Calling the international  community's attention to China's military threat a
result of the emergence of China as a super-power, Chen said the number of
missiles China has deployed to target Taiwan has increased from 200 in 2000 to
nearly 1,000 in 2007.</P>
      <P>Also, Beijing enacted the so-called Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan in March
2005, despite opposition from the international community, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>He urged the German government to exert its influence and lobby the European
Union to maintain its arms embargo against China until China democratizes its
political system and improves its human rights record.</P>

President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney aggressively challenged the

In separate appearances that served as a prelude to an inevitable veto showdown,

Wall Street Journal:Why Korea Makes The World's Best Women Golfers

Why are there so many great Korean women golfers?

South Korea is hardly golfing nirvana. A small country roughly the size of
Indiana, its mountainous terrain leaves room for only 250 golf courses. Indiana
has 470. With green fees averaging over $200 per round, most players in South
Korea are politicians and businessmen out on the company dime. Men outnumber
women on Korea's courses by almost 9 to 1.

Yet in the past decade, South Korean women have come to dominate the world's top
women's golf tour, the U.S. Ladies Professional Golf Association, or LPGA. In
1997 there were no Koreans in the LPGA. Now 14 of the LPGA's latest class of 33
rookies, first-time tour players who have survived the sport's competitive
winnowing process, hail from South Korea. And among the 138 women golfers in the
elite category who are automatically qualified to play in each LPGA tournament,
34 -- almost a quarter -- are Korean.</TEXT>

      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung vowed Wednesday to take
legal action against what he called "false charges" made by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) concerning the party's assets.</P>
      <P>Wu made the comments after Premier Su Tseng-chang earlier presided over a
ceremony in the Executive Yuan marking the launch of a Cabinet Web site on the
KMT's assets. Su encouraged the public to visit the Web site and called for
widespread support of the government's drive to demand that the KMT return its
ill-gotten assets to the national coffers.</P>
      <P>In the face of the DPP administration's efforts to re-appropriate KMT's assets,
Wu said that his party will undoubtedly file lawsuits for each of the groundless

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers complained Wednesday
of a quota requirement that the party plans to impose on its public office
holders regarding liquidating the main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) assets,
arguing that the issue must not become a liability for the DPP.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative caucus whip Wang Tuoh voiced the concern in a Legislative Yuan
news conference and urged the party central to refrain from implementing the
drastic measure, which he warned might strain party unity.</P>
      <P>Wang made the comments after it was reported that the DPP intends to impose
quotas on its public office holders, requiring them to collect enough signatures
to endorse a DPP-initiated campaign demanding that the KMT return its illegally
acquired assets.</P>
      <P>According to local media reports, the DPP is planning to adopt the measure in a
party congress slated for late June that will suspend for one year the
membership rights of those who fail to obtain the number of signatures allocated
by the party central. The DPP has been seriously lagging behind in the campaign
second-phase schedule of targets in terms of signatures collected, the reports
stated.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the party central should not approve the controversial
measure at this sensitive time in the run up to the legislative and presidential
primary elections.</P>
      <P>Suspending  someone's party membership  might be viewed or misunderstood as a
scheme to rule out potential candidates, thus hobbling party unity, Wang said.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, putting the KMT assets issue to a national referendum
alongside the presidential election will be a development of major significance.
Although getting back unlawfully obtained assets for the national coffers serves
social justice, he said, it is worth noting that the issue will be ineligible
from inclusion in public referenda for three years should it fail to pass in the
first attempt.</P>
      <P>Wang suggested the DPP central encourage party members by offering substantial
incentives instead of punishments so as to not upset party unity.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Cheng Yun-peng said he cannot accept the logic behind the party's
planned imposition of the measure, questioning "Why must responsibility for the
KMT's wrongdoing be assumed by the DPP? "</P>
      <P>Such a wrongheaded move will hurt the DPP, and the issue must not be turned into
a weapon with which to defeat opponents in the party's legislative primary, he
said.</P>
      <P>Wu Ping-jei, a DPP Central Standing Committee member, also voiced his worry that
the quota allocation proposal might spark disputes within the party,
particularly at a time when the party's legislative primary is entering the
final stage. The party central must give the issue a second thought, he said.</P>

      <P>Former Premier Frank C.T. Hsieh called on the public to participate in a fund
raising activity initiated by the Paperwindmill Theater -- a kids' drama troupe
-- to take their performances for kids in townships around the island.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who is running for the Democratic Progressive Party's nomination to run
in the 2008 presidential election, made the appeal together with the troupe's
leader Jen Chien-cheng at a news conference at Hsieh's campaign headquarter
Wednesday morning.</P>
      <P>Hieh invited greater participation in the activity, called "Art Project for Kids
in 319 Townships -- First Mile Kid's Smile, " which aims to solicit donations to
enable the troupe to perform for kids in each of Taiwan's 319 townships.</P>
      <P>Participants may donate money to "adopt a performance" for townships that they
designated, and when designated funds for a township reach NT$350,000
(US$10,545) ,  the troupe will make arrangements to present a performance for
the area's children.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he was touched by the headquarter's two volunteer workers, who
donated NT$60,000, and immediately followed suit, donating funds to sponsor
performances in Penghu County's Makung City and Nantou County's Chushan
Township.</P>
      <P>Explaining his reasons for choosing the two places, Hsieh pointed out that he
changed his household registration to Penghu County in the past in order to
avoid being arrested by the Kuomintang, and the Kaohsiung City government built
more than 100 prefabricated temporary houses in Nantou for victims of 921
earthquake during his tenure as Kaohsiung City mayor.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the activity will allow children in remote places to take in
performance art that is not usually easy for them to access as townships office
cannot often afford the expense.</P>
      <P>Hsieh hopes that more people will join in this activity, with each individual
donating NT$100 to help expand the horizons of kids in far away townships.</P>

      <P>Key members of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) may be disciplined
if they fail to collect sufficient signatures in the party's drive to force a
referendum on appropriating opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) ill-gotten assets,
aDPP Central Standing Committee resolution affirmed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The DPP is pushing for a referendum to deal with the Kuomintang's ill gotten
assets alongside the 2008 presidential election and is currently trying to
collect the signatures of 1 million citizens to back the initiative.</P>
      <P>The DPP imposed quota requirements on its members holding party or public
offices, compelling them to gather signatures, but so far the drive is well
behind schedule, according to the party.</P>
      <P>The DPP's acting Chairman Trong Chai suggested during the Central Standing
Committee meeting that the committee propose disciplining key members who fail
to collect the required numbers of signatures by suspending their party
memberships for one year. This proposal would then be taken up at the party's
National Congress, scheduled for July.</P>
      <P>However,  several committee members,  including the party's legislative caucus
leader Ker Chien-ming, argued that such matters regarding penalties against
party members should not be determined by the committee.</P>
      <P>The committee eventually reached a resolution that such cases be referred to the
Central Review Committee for a decision over discipline.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lawrence Gao said it is already stated in the party's constitution
that the partyshall deliberate and take appropriate disciplinary action towards
members whose statements or conduct violate the constitution or resolutions, or
are deemed to destroy Party reputation, and therefore the new resolution came
only as a reaffirmation, adopted to remind members of the need to help achieve
the party's goals.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM NEEDED TO MAKE TAIWAN 'NORMAL COUNTRY': CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Berlin,  April  26  (CNA)
04/26/07  13:59:28
(By Lin Yu-li and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed Wednesday the country's need to reform its
constitution to make Taiwan a "normal country."</P>
      <P>Speaking during a video conference with a group of German politicians, academics
and media representatives, Chen said that many of the problems  that Taiwan
faces today are related to its constitutional system and that the country
urgently needs a new constitution that is viable and up to date.</P>
      <P>First of all, Chen noted, Taiwan's current Constitution was enacted in China 60
years ago without the consent of the people in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition, the constitutional system is confusing because it is neither a
parliamentary system nor a presidential system, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>The president said various civil groups in the country have put forth a total of
15 different versions of draft amendments to the Constitution, including some
that touch on sensitive issues such as changing the country's official name to
"Republic of Taiwan" and forming a "second republic."</P>
      <P>However, no matter which versions are adopted, they will have to be approved by
the Legislative Yuan first and passed in a public referendum before they can be
written into the Constitution, Chen said.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan, like other emerging democracies, faces problems such as vicious
partisan  struggle,  transitional  justice and constitutional reform, none of
them are as serious as the differences over national identity, he said.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed the rise of Taiwan consciousness in the country in recent years
proves that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party is on the right track and
that more and more people believe the party stands a good chance of winning the
2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's relations with China, Chen said unification between the two sides is
impossible at present because Beijing continues to deny Taiwan's status as an
independent sovereign state.</P>
      <P>The president noted that the National Unification Council and the National
Unification Guidelines, which set unification with China as the ultimate goal
and which ceased to function and apply last year, were adopted by the former
Kuomintang government without the people's consent.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the former government followed a "one China" principle and
used to compete with Beijing for the right to represent "China, " but the
present government recognizes that "one China" refers to the People's Republic
of China.</P>
      <P>Asserting that Taiwan is a separate country from China, Chen said Taiwan now
hopes to apply to join international organizations such as the United States
under the name of "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Chen pledged that he will continue to strengthen the Taiwanese identity during
the remaining year of his term.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen expressed the hope that he will be able to visit Germany as the
president of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said he was meeting with the German friends via video conference because no
president of Taiwan has been able to obtain a visa to visit Germany or any other
European Union countries.</P>
      <P>Even though Taiwan has maintained diplomatic relations with the Holy See for
more than 60 years, no president of Taiwan had been able to set foot on Vatican
soil until 2005, when he was granted permission to make a transit stop in Italy
in order to be able to attend the funeral of the late Pope John Paul II, he
noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA PANNED OVER OPPOSITION TO TAIWAN'S WHO BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 26 (CNA)
04/26/07  14:15:10
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) slammed China Thursday over its opposition to
Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Organization (WHO) , saying China's
hidebound intolerance toward Taiwan people's desire for inclusion into the
global health care system signifies its contempt for human rights.</P>
      <P>The MAC, a Cabinet-level body in charge of Taiwan's China policy planning,
issued the press statement after China unleashed ugly invective the day before
against Taiwan's WHO membership bid.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office said Wednesday that Beijing
strongly opposes Taiwan's new bid to join the WHO under the name of "Taiwan"
because Taiwan, as part of China, is not eligible to join the WHO as a member or
quasi-member.</P>
      <P>The spokesman also claimed that Taiwan is not qualified to join the World Health
Assembly (WHA) , the WHO's highest decision-making body, as an observer. The
statement further accused Taiwan of using the WHO bid as a ploy aimed at
elevating its pro-independence secessionist activities to an international
forum.</P>
      <P>In response, the MAC deplored in the press statement China's obstinate bigotry
against the reality that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait do not belong to
each other.</P>
      <P>Noting that health care is a basic human right, the MAC statement said epidemics
prevention and control know no borders or political doctrines and stances.</P>
      <P>With an overwhelming majority of the 23 million Taiwan people keenly yearning
for their country's participation in the WHO, the MAC statement warned China
that its indifference to their health rights as shown in its persistent
obstruction of Taiwan's WHO membership bid will only enrage them and drive the
two sides of the Taiwan strait further apart.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, Taiwan's annual drives to become an observer at the WHA as a "health
entity" have invariably been thwarted by Beijing. This year, Taiwan adopted a
new strategy, with President Chen Shui-bian writing to the WHO Secretariat to
express Taiwan's intention to join the WHO as a full member under the name of
"Taiwan." Due to China's opposition, the bid failed again.</P>
      <P>In the press statement, the MAC also condemned China for denying a visa to
Kaohsiung City Deputy Mayor Cheng Wen-lung to attend an annual meeting of the
General Association of International Sports Federations (GAISF) which opened in
Beijing Wednesday. Cheng originally planned to take advantage of the event to
brief the participants on progress in preparations for the 2009 World Games to
be hosted by Taiwan's southern port city.</P>
      <P>The MAC urged the international sports community to pay heed to China's
perennial obstruction of Taiwan's attempts to participate in international
activities, even such non-political ones as the GAISF.</P>
      <P>On the April 28-29 economic and cultural forum to be held in Beijing under the
auspices of Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang and the Communist Party of
China, the MAC said the event is just another example of China's "divide and
conquer" tactics against Taiwan. The MAC reminded Beijing that its scheme to
debase Taiwan's popularly elected government by collaborating with Taiwan's
opposition party will never succeed and will turn out to be a disservice to
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>For the well-being of both sides of the Taiwan Strait, the MAC statement said,

    <HEADLINE>CHEN ASKS CABINET TO STUDY RAISING MONTHLY STIPEND FOR ELDERLY FARMERS</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that he has asked the Executive Yuan to
study the issue of raising the monthly allowance for elderly farmers by NT$1,000
(US$30) to NT$6,000 if a proposed national pension program fails to clear the
legislature by July.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while inspecting a lychee farm in Kaohsiung
County in southern Taiwan. Accompanying him were Cho Jung-tai, deputy secretary-
general of the Presidential Office, and David Lee, director-general of the
Presidential Office's Department of Public Affairs.</P>
      <P>Recent reports said that a draft bill on the national pension program mapped out
by the Ministry of the Interior will be sent to the Executive Yuan for screening
May 2. The Executive Yuan hopes the draft bill can clear the Legislative Yuan by
November so that the program can be put into practice in January 2008, the
reports said.</P>
      <P>Under the draft bill, the ensured persons will start to pay a monthly premium of
NT$618 at that age of 25 and will be entitled to a monthly pension of NT$7,603
when they reach 65.</P>
      <P>The draft bill calls for the integration of four current monthly allowances --
the NT$3,000 monthly allowance for seniors, the NT%5,999 for elderly farmers,
the NT$3,000 for aboriginal seniors, and the NT$6,000 for seniors in low-income
households.</P>
      <P>The allowances for the four groups of people will be scrapped in due time so as
to prevent political parties from proposing increases in allowances ahead of
every election to curry favor with voters, thus exacerbating the government's
already strained financial situation, according to the draft bill.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Lee Yi-yang refused to say Thursday  whether  the plan
to grant sentence commutations to prison inmates will be implemented May 20,
saying only that all matters in this regard will be conducted in accordance with
the law.</P>
      <P>After President Chen Shui-bian instructed the Executive Yuan Tuesday to work out
a plan for a national amnesty, the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) produced a
preliminary draft of a national sentence commutation bill that same day, Lee
said, adding that the MOJ will consult the Interior Ministry before referring
the draft bill to the Executive Yuan May 2 for approval.</P>
      <P>If the draft bill is approved by the Executive Yuan, it will then be submitted
for deliberation by the Legislative Yuan, paving the way for its implementation,
Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that the draft bill will only commute sentences for criminals serving
time for minor offenses, adding that it will not commute capital sentences to
life sentences nor include those convicted of serious crimes and crimes that
endanger society. Crimes against the Prevention and Punishment of Sex-Trade Act
and special financial crimes will also be excluded, he added.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks during an interpellation session at the Legislative Home and
Nations Committee.</P>
      <P>The previous commutation was meted out in Taiwan 16 years ago to celebrate the
80th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Chen said recently that another commutation is appropriate for this year, as it
is the 20th anniversary of the lifting of martial law and the 60th anniversary
of the 228 Incident.</P>
      <P>More than 10,000 prison inmates are expected to benefit if the bill is passed.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan ranks 18th in the world in terms of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, with
per capita emissions standing at 11.26 tons in 2004, a spokesman for the
International Energy Agency (IEA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The IEA spokesman was responding to an inquiry by CNA about the exact figures of
Taiwan's greenhouse gas emissions after a Taiwan environmental researcher warned
a day earlier that Taiwan ranked first in the world in terms of per capita CO2
emissions growth between 1990 and 2005.</P>
      <P>Liu Shaw-chen, chief of the Academia Sinica's Research Center for Environmental
Change, also warned that Taiwan ranked fourth in the world in terms of per
capita greenhouse gas emissions, behind only the United States, Australia and
Canada.</P>
      <P>The IEA spokesman, however, said that according to the IEA's 2006 study, Taiwan
ranked 18th in per capita CO2 emissions, and not fourth, in the world in 2004.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the IEA tallies showed that Taiwan outstripped other East Asian
countries in terms of per capita greenhouse gas emissions in 2004, with South
Korea ranking 25th in the world and Japan ranking 26th.</P>
      <P>According to the IEA data, Qatar ranked first in terms of per capita greenhouse
gas emissions at 49.64 tons, followed by Kuwait, Luxembourg, the United Arab
Emirates, Bahrain, the United States, Australia and Canada, in that order.</P>

      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang reconfirmed Thursday a revelation the
day before that his Saint Lucian counterpart  has announced the eastern
Caribbean island nation's decision to re-establish diplomatic ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Huang expressed the hope that the two nations can sign a communique marking the
official re-establishment of ties as soon as possible and said his ministry is
working to complete all the relevant follow-up procedures.</P>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Wednesday that Saint Lucia has become Taiwan's 25th
diplomatic ally after Saint Lucia's minister of foreign affairs announced the
news. Su described the resumption of diplomatic ties with Saint Lucia as one of
the most encouraging news events since he assumed the premiership early last
year.</P>
      <P>In response to reporters' questions, Huang said that while negotiating for the
resumption of Taiwan-Saint Lucia ties, Taiwan never once asked the island nation
to severe its diplomatic relations with China. And Saint Lucia has no intention
of doing so, he added.</P>
      <P>Asked about the anticipated protest from Beijing, Huang stressed that diplomacy
is "not a zero-sum game." He added that Taiwan does not want to compete with
China, its political rival, in the diplomatic field, pointing out that "all we
hope is that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will expand their respective
diplomatic territory on their own."</P>
      <P>Huang said it is no secret that Taiwan has been seeking to re-establish
diplomatic relations with Saint Lucia.</P>
      <P>Over the past four months, Huang said, he made two separate visits to the
country, including one in March at the invitation of his Saint Lucian
counterpart.</P>
      <P>The East Caribbean nation first established diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1984
but then switched diplomatic recognition to China in 1997.</P>

      <P>The Humanistic Education Foundation (HEF) presented Thursday the Chinese version
of a guidance manual from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) on how to discipline a child.</P>
      <P>At the presentation ceremony held in Taipei, HEF founder and Executive Chairman
Shih Ying said the manual offers teachers and parents positive ways to teach
their children, instead of traditional discipline practices such as corporal
punishment.</P>
      <P>In the manual, titled "Positive Discipline in the Inclusive, Learning-Friendly
Classroom, " the educational experts suggest that teachers and parents respect
the child's dignity; develop pro-social behavior, self-discipline, and
character; maximize the child's active participation; respect the child's
developmental needs and quality of life; respect the child's motivational
characteristics and life views; assure fairness and transformative justice; and
promote solidarity among children.</P>
      <P>The experts also suggest that teachers and parents reward and recognize good
behavior in four manners: describe the appropriate behavior,  provide clear
reasons,  request acknowledgement, and reinforce correct behavior.</P>
      <P>By giving eye-contact, a nod or a smile, an extra five minutes of play time,
extra credit points, or having good behavior praised in front of a class or a
school is the best way of rewarding a good deed by children, which the experts
say will have strong and positive effects in disciplining children, the manual
suggests.</P>

advantage because of their foreign language ability, although many agree the
ability is crucial to their competitiveness in the job market, according to the
results of a survey released Thursday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the Council of Labor Affairs' Bureau of Employment
and Vocational Training from March 5-27 among 3,287 job-seekers and 492
employers.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 85 percent of new graduates had begun to look for jobs
before graduating and the electronics, information technology and service
industries are the most popular employment fields.</P>
      <P>However, 13 percent of the employers said they are not hiring new graduates
because they lack experience and because there are few positions suitable for
them.</P>
      <P>The survey shows that in addition to academic background and proficiency on the
part of job applicants, the major criteria used by employers in hiring workers
also include sales ability, professional skills, computer skills and foreign
language ability.</P>
      <P>While 58 percent of the new graduates surveyed said they believe a higher
education background will facilitate their job searches, 46 percent of the
employers said the educational background of job applicants will affect their
hiring decisions.</P>
      <P>However, most of the employers surveyed do not care whether job applicants are
graduates of famous universities or not, with 52 percent saying there is no
direct connection between their hiring decision and the universities  from which
the applicants have graduated.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 33 percent of the employers said they will not hire job applicants
who are self-righteous and arrogant, 27 percent will reject applicants who are
unable to express themselves clearly and 20 percent will say no to those who

convicted of serious crimes that endanger society, such as murder, corruption,
sexual assault or economic crime.</P>

      <P>Lee made the remarks in an interpellation session at the Legislative National

      <P>Taiwan stands firm on its bid to pursue membership of the World Health
Organization (WHO) , despite remarks made by a WHO official denouncing Taiwan's
application, a government official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to Chang Wu-shiu, director-general of the Bureau of International
Cooperation under the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) , the government
will not deviate from its goal of becoming a full WHO member, even though its
latest bid was crushed by the WHO a day earlier.</P>
      <P>A WHO official called Taiwan's application a "non-issue" late Wednesday and said
that the WHO will not deal further with it after thorough study and legal
consultation, on the grounds that Taiwan is ineligible  to apply for membership,
which requires statehood recognized by the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Noting that the DOH has yet to verify the remarks by the WHO official to
determine whether his comments represented the WHO's official stance concerning
Taiwan's membership bid, Chang said that the government will continue soliciting
support of its bid from the member states of the World Health Assembly (WHA) --
the WHO's highest decision-making unit.</P>
      <P>The issue pertaining to Taiwan's WHO membership is up to the WHA member states
to decide, Chang said.</P>
      <P>In an April 11 letter sent to WHO Director-General Margaret Chan, President Chen
Shui-bian stated the country's desire to join the WHO as a full member under the
name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) Acting Spokeswoman Yeh Fei-bi said
that the ministry had not received WHO notification of the bid rejection.</P>
      <P>Despite the setback, Taiwan remains committed to pursuing its WHO membership and
seeking support from allied countries to back its bid, Yeh said in a routine
news conference.</P>
      <P>This is the first time the government has applied to enter the WHO in the name
of Taiwan in more than a decade, she added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET HOPES LEGISLATURE WILL PASS PENSION PROGRAM BILL</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan will send a draft bill on a national pension program to the
Legislative Yuan next week, hoping that it will pass the bill quickly, Cabinet
spokeswoman Chen Mei-ling said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen Mei-ling made the remarks after President Chen Shui-bian said earlier the
same day during an inspection tour in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan that he has
asked the Executive Yuan to study the issue of raising the monthly allowance for
elderly farmers by NT$1,000 (US$30) to NT$6,000 if the proposed bill fails to
clear the legislature by July.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan recently said that in view of current financial strain and
the promotion of a national pension program, it would not favor an increase of
the monthly stipend for elderly farmers.</P>
      <P>Asked if President Chen's remarks run counter to that of the Executive Yuan's
stance as well as a resolution reached at a national economic development
conference last year, the spokeswoman said the Cabinet's stance on "no increase
prior to the implementation of the national pension program" remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>She said the Executive Yuan will do its best to communicate with the Legislative
Yuan, hoping for speedy passage of the draft bill.</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) has estimated that around 700,500 elderly
farmers receive monthly allowances of NT$5,000. If they were to get an
additional NT$1,000, it would cost the government an extra NT$8.4 billion
annually.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, lawmakers from across the party spectrum were unanimous in supporting
the increase for farmers.</P>
      <P>Legislator Ker Chien-ming, a caucus whip of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party, said the party still hopes that the national pension program should be
given priority, but added that if the bill cannot clear the legislature by July,
then raising the monthly allowance for farmers is also an option.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hsu Shao-ping, a caucus whip of the main opposition Kuomintang, said
a hike of NT$1,000 is acceptable to the party.</P>
      <P>Recent reports said the Executive Yuan hopes the draft pension bill can clear
the Legislative Yuan by November so that the program can be put into practice in
January 2008.</P>
      <P>Under the draft bill, insured persons who start to pay a monthly premium of
NT$618 at the age of 25 will be entitled to a monthly pension of NT$7,603 when
they reach 65.</P>
      <P>The bill will cover those aged 25-65 who are currently not paying military,
civil servant, teacher or labor insurance, as well as farmers under 65. It is
estimated that 3.53 million will be included in the national pension program.</P>
      <P>The draft bill also calls for the integration of four current monthly allowances
-- the NT$3,000 monthly allowance for seniors, the NT$5,999 for elderly farmers,
the NT$3,000 for aboriginal seniors and the NT$6,000 for seniors in low-income
households.</P>
      <P>Once the national pension program is implemented, the allowances for the four
groups will be scrapped so as to prevent political parties from proposing
increases in allowances ahead of every election to curry favor with voters, thus
exacerbating the government's already strained financial situation.</P>

Thursday, calling for Hualien residents to launch a rally in Taipei May 3 in

the northeastern county of Yilan with Hualien County.</P>
      <P>It was resolved at the meeting that 10,000 Hualien residents, to be led by three
legislators from across the political spectrum and four former Hualien
magistrates, will proceed to Taipei May 3 and march to the Presidential  Office,
the Executive  Yuan,  the Environmental Protection Administration and the Landis
Hotel Taipei to rally support for the freeway and protest against those who
oppose the development plan, according to Fu Kun-chi, an opposition People First
Party legislator representing Hualien.</P>
      <P>Fu called for Hualien residents to demonstrate esprit de corps, saying that it
is high time the Hualien people voice their cause before the development plan is
aborted under environmental protection considerations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hualien County Council Speaker Yang Wen-chih, who co-sponsored the
meeting, claimed that the freeway is now a "common wish of the Hualien
residents, " although a related environmental analysis  review that will decide
the fate of the freeway's development has become stuck due to intervention by
the environmental protection authorities and private environmental groups.</P>
      <P>Yang called for the Hualien residents to go for broke "to defend their rights
and interests."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, members of the Hualien tourism sector said they will also stage a
protest in front of Ritz Landis Hotel Taipei May 3 to vent their anger at
Stanley Yen, chairman of the Landis hotel group, who has voiced his opposition
to the freeway development plan recently, saying that the Suhua freeway
development plan is an ethical rather than a political issue.</P>

      <P>A long-term dispute over the funding of a Tainan underground rail project was
settled Thursday after Premier Su Tseng-chang gave his word Thursday that the
Tainan city government will only have to shoulder 12.5 percent of the cost.</P>
      <P>Su, who is bidding to represent the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in
the 2008 presidential election, met with Tainan Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair and
legislators from the southern city.</P>
      <P>The premier said the city government will only have to shoulder 12.5 percent, or
NT$3.7 billion of the total budget, with the central government providing the
balance.</P>
      <P>According to an estimate by the Ministry of Transportation and Communication
(MOTC) , a budget of NT$29.58 billion (US$896.36 million) is required to make a
7.55-km section of the railway in the city run underground.</P>
      <P>Su expressed hope that construction of the project can start soon so that
further city development will not harm the preservation of the numerous heritage
sites in the city, which is dubbed as Taiwan's "cultural old city."</P>
      <P>Tainan proposed the project to the Executive Yuan in 2004 but it never got off
the ground because both the central and city governments could not afford the
cost.</P>
      <P>The MOTC asked the city to put up NT$7.14 billion, but the financially strapped
local government complained that it could not afford to.</P>
      <P>The city government even suggested that the central government make available
the full amount needed for the project, or else allow the city government to
repay the central government at a rate of either NT$2.5 billion over 15 years or
NT$4 billion over 25 years.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times:Court Asked to Limit Lawyers at Guantanamo

The Justice Department has asked a federal appeals court to impose tighter
restrictions on the hundreds of lawyers who represent detainees at Guantanamo
Bay, Cuba, and the request has become a central issue in a new legal battle over
the administration detention policies.

Saying that visits by civilian lawyers and attorney-client mail have caused
intractable problems and threats to security at Guantanamo, a Justice Department
filing proposes new limits on the lawyers'contact with their clients and access
to evidence in their cases that would replace more expansive rules that have
governed them since they began visiting Guantanamo detainees in large numbers in
2004.

Wall Street Journal:German Giant Siemens Faces Leadership Crisis

For Klaus Kleinfeld, chief executive of German engineering giant Siemens AG, the
end came swiftly as he lost the backing of key members of his board, who went so
far as to try to recruit a new CEO over the weekend. Yesterday, amid a widening
corruption probe at Siemens, Mr. Kleinfeld abruptly said he wouldn't stay beyond
September.

The exit leaves a vacuum at the top of Siemens and marks a dramatic reversal for
Mr. Kleinfeld, a hard-charging 49-year-old who is one of Europe's leading
corporate executives. Mr. Kleinfeld has won plaudits from Siemens shareholders
for aggressively restructuring the sprawling industrial conglomerate and
boosting its profits since he took over in January 2005.</TEXT>

      <P>National  Police  Agency  (NPA) Director-General Hou Yu-ih said Thursday that he
is against granting amnesty or reducing jail terms to those convicted of violent
crimes or under a sentence of death.</P>
      <P>Hou made the comments during a question-and-answer session in the Legislative

lawmakers who are concerned that demonstrating leniency would deal a blow to
public order and assert that most of the rank-and-file policemen are opposed to
the idea.</P>
      <P>Under instructions from President Chen Shui-bian,  relevant government agencies
recently proposed an act to reduce prison terms or a partial amnesty for
criminals. One of the authorities' arguments in support of the idea is that "all

convicted of minor offenses carrying a sentence of less than one year.</P>
      <P>But Hou added that in his capacity as the highest police officer charged with
maintaining the rule of law and public order across the country, he would
"object" to the proposed amnesty if it were to include those convicted of

      <P>Exports of Taiwan's pharmaceutical products increased NT$620 million (US$18.6
million) during the last year for a year-on-year growth of 4 percent, according
to the statistics released by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) Thursday.</P>
      <P>Officials  of MOEA's Industrial  Development  Bureau  (IDB) attributed the
growth in exports to the 2005 establishment of three alliances for
pharmaceutical product exports targeting markets in United States, Europe and
Japan, which collectively account for more than 80 percent of the global
pharmaceutical market.</P>
      <P>Officials noted that the establishment of the three alliances, under the
coordination  of Pharmaceutical  Industry  Technology Development Center
(PITDC), have helped local pharmaceutical products manufacturers set up their
own brands and strengthen their marketing in global markets.</P>
      <P>In addition to helping local companies better understand American pharmaceutical
enterprises' preferences, the alliances are also assisting domestic firms to
develop a presence in the European market as early as possible, the officials
added.</P>
      <P>The efforts of the export alliances have encouraged some domestic groups to

      <P>Chen said the Executive Yuan will abide by a resolution passed by a national

    <TEXT>
      <P>The country's trade and industrial sectors were out of tune with the
administration Thursday over the issue of a minimum wage hike.</P>
      <P>At a meeting called by Minister of Economic Affairs Steve R. L. Chen on the
minimum wage adjustment plan, representatives of the Taipei-based Chinese
National Federation of Industries (CNFI) and the General Chamber of Commerce of
the Republic of China (GCCROC) did not agree with a 10-percent hike in the
minimum wage proposed by the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA).</P>
      <P>The CLA recently suggested a 10-percent rise in the minimum wage to make it more
commensurate with Taiwan's general economic situation and consumer price index.
The wage has remained frozen at the same level for the past 10 years.</P>
      <P>Ho Yu, a standing board member of the CNFI, said that if the minimum wage is to
be raised, it should be capped under five percent, while GCCROC Secretary-
General Chiu Chao-hsin said that the GCCROC's bottom line is five percent and no
higher.</P>
      <P>Firmly opposing a 10-percent rise, Ho said the industrial sector will have to
pay an extra NT$3.6 billion (US$1.09 billion) to workers if the minimum wage is
hiked by one percent.</P>
      <P>The industrial sector will add an extra NT$14.5 billion to its overhead costs if
the minimum wage rises by five percent, and NT$39.4 billion if the minimum wage
is hiked 11 percent, Ho continued.</P>
      <P>Ho also quoted a recent poll conducted by the CNFI as indicating that 56 percent
of the federation's members are opposed to a minimum wage hike,  while four
percent  of the members agree with a three-percent hike, 25 percent agree with a
five-percent rise and the remaining 15 percent favor a hike that exceeds five-
percent.</P>
      <P>Chiu said that it is untrue that the minimum wage has been frozen for 10 years,
arguing that over the past 10 years the average work week has been shortened
while employers have been made to pay for overtime hours and various welfare
measures.</P>
      <P>According to Chiu, certain businesses, including traditional manufacturing
industries,  small-  and medium-size enterprises, restaurants and other
commercial services, will be among the first sectors to bear the brunt of a
minimum wage hike.</P>

      <P>County Magistrate Chou Hsih-wei signed the agreement with NTU President Lee Si-
chen on the cooperative ties, which involve the two sides jointly working out
plans to train local communities in skills and know-how needed in disaster
prevention and rescue operations.</P>
      <P>The two parties will also collaborate with each other in integrating data banks
on disaster control and prevention, mapping out a plan to evacuate personnel in
case of massive landslides, and develop a flood warning system, according to the
county fire department.</P>
      <P>Addressing the event, Chou said it's the county government's duty to safeguard
the lives of residents and their property, and natural disasters such as
typhoons, earthquakes and landslide have been occurring more frequently in the
past few years.</P>
      <P>Against that backdrop, Chou said his government budgeted NT$9 million this year
to continue its work with NTU in upgrading disaster prevention  operations
through  the  application  of  advanced technologies. The work was undertaken as
a part of the central government-initiated national technology program on
disaster control and prevention, which ended last year.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has been ranked the 6th most favorable investment market among 50
countries, according to an evaluation report released Thursday by the Business
Environment Risk Intelligence (BERI).</P>
      <P>Ranked after Switzerland, Singapore, the Netherlands, Japan and Norway, Taiwan
received 72 points from the BERI for its investment environment, and rated as a
Grade A1 environment -- the highest grade available -- indicating a country with
low risks and a positive investment environment.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's ranking in this, the first evaluation of 2007, is consistent with the
previous evaluation from the latter part of 2006.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's operational risk index was only lower than that of Switzerland and
Singapore, its remittance and repatriation factor ranked 5th, while its
political risk index was ranked 15th, moving down one point due to the upcoming
year-end legislative election.</P>
      <P>The BERI expects continuous improvement in Taiwan's general investment
environment, with ranking remaining unchanged but growing to 73 point within one
year, and 74 points in five years.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the BERI forecasts that Taiwan's operational risk index will be stable
or improve during 2007-2008, and that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will
increase thanks to a vigorous supply and demand market.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday that Beijing's proposed route for the 2008
Olympic torch relay is unacceptable to Taiwan, adding that Taiwan's sovereign
status should not be undermined under any circumstances.</P>
      <P>Commenting on China's plan that the Olympic torch would travel from Vietnam's Ho
Chi Minh City to Taipei and then continue on to Hong Kong, Macau and several
other Chinese cities before arriving in the host city, Beijing, Su said at the
Legislative Yuan that Taiwan belongs to the International  Olympic Committee
(IOC)  as an independent sports entity and has taken part in Olympic
competitions on an equal footing for years.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he said, China has persistently schemed to belittle Taiwan, trying
to downgrade Taiwan to the level of a province of China, and the torch relay
plan -- announced by organizers for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games the day
before -- is another example of China's attempt to undermine Taiwan's sovereign
status.</P>
      <P>On a reporter's  question  on whether  Taiwan will resume negotiations with
China if the Beijing Olympics organizers are willing to revise the torch relay
route, Su said that Taiwan will be willing to talk to Beijing so long as
Taiwan's sovereignty is not belittled or compromised.</P>
      <P>Su, meanwhile, declined to speculate on whether Taiwan will boycott the 2008
Olympic Games altogether because of Beijing's attempt to downgrade Taiwan
through the torch relay plan, saying that "currently, we are only handling
issues of the moment."</P>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) rejected Beijing's torch relay plan soon
after the plan was publicized late Thursday. MAC officials said the plan is
unacceptable as it deliberately undermines Taiwan's sovereign status.</P>
      <P>Saying that the Chinese officials have played politics with the torch relay
plan, MAC officials insisted that Taiwan cannot accept the Beijing-proposed
torch relay route because it purposely includes Taipei as part of the "domestic
leg" of the relay.</P>
      <P>MAC officials added that the government would welcome the arrival of the Beijing
Olympic torch if it were to come to Taipei via a third country and then head on
to another third country.</P>
      <P>The 2008 Olympic Games are scheduled to be held in Beijing Aug. 8-24 next year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ABOUT 25,000 INMATES TO BE SET FREE UNDER AMNESTY PLAN: MOJ</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 27 (CNA)
04/27/07  13:11:09
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An estimated 25,000 prison inmates serving sentences for petty crimes or minor
transgressions will be set free soon after a national commutation bill takes
effect, Minister of Justice Shih Mao-lin said Friday.</P>
      <P>If the proposed presidential amnesty plan comes into effect in June, Shih added,
about 7,500 inmates can be freed from prison in the near term under the new
working guidelines of "simplified procedures and convenient operations."</P>
      <P>Noting that the National Commutation Bill of 2007 is being drawn up in line with
the country's new punitive criminal justice policy that calls for leniency for
occasional minor offenders and harsh penalties for those who have committed
felonies, Shih said about 150 types of crimes will be excluded from the amnesty
list.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, serious offenses inapplicable to the proposed amnesty will
include violent crimes, particularly cases of kidnapping for ransom and murder,
serious cases of carjacking for ransom and telephone fraud, sexual offenses
committed against children and women, economic crimes, serious violations of
national interests, such as corruption, and serious violations of the National
Security Law.</P>
      <P>"While mulling the scope of offenses to be eligible  for commutation of
sentences, we just weighed the categories of crimes and gravity of sentences and
didn't touch on any individual cases. As a result, it's not known at this moment
whether any particular inmate will be excluded from the amnesty list or not,"
Shih said.</P>
      <P>As of the end of March, 8,581 of those who had received sentences of less than
one year were still serving time behind bars. If the amnesty plan is implemented
from June, about 7,500 of the inmates in this group can be set free within a
month, Shih said, adding that the exact number will require a further check
after the draft commutation bill clears the legislature.</P>
      <P>Acting on President Chen Shui-bian's directive, the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) is
drafting the commutation statute to implement a reduction of sentences to mark
the 20th anniversary of the lifting of martial law and the 60th anniversary of
the 228 Incident of 1947, a civilian uprising against the then-Kuomintang
government that led to a bloody massacre.</P>
      <P>Shih said the draft bill will be ready for delivery to the Executive Yuan for
further review next week, after which it will be sent to the Legislative Yuan
for deliberation and approval.</P>
      <P>Responding to complaints by an advocacy group calling for the abolishment of
capital punishment that the MOJ has ignored President Chen's previous directive
on suspending execution of death sentences, Shih said phasing out capital
punishment is an established national policy.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Shih added that the MOJ cannot ignore public sentiments and
opinions about such a reform move.</P>
      <P>"The ministry has been contemplating complementary measures in preparation for
the abolishment of the death penalty in line with the president's directive. On
the other hand, we are also endeavoring to strike a balance between the policy
demand and public response to the proposed reform," Shih explained.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY ISSUE POSES TEST FOR TAIPEI, BEIJING, IOC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 27 (CNA)
04/27/07  13:17:53

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's snub of China's offer to include its capital city of Taipei on the
Olympic torch relay route for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games poses a test to the
governments on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and to the International Olympic
Committee (IOC), analysts said Friday.</P>
      <P>Within hours of Beijing's announcement of what would be the longest torch relay
in Olympic history -- a 137,000-kilometer route that would cross five continents
and scale Mount Everest, Taiwan rejected being included on the route.</P>
      <P>According to Beijing's announcement, the Olympic torch would arrive in Taipei
from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam before traveling to China-controlled Hong Kong
and Macau.</P>
      <P>"It is something that Taiwan's government and people cannot accept because the
route is defined by Beijing as a domestic route, which constitutes an attempt to
downgrade our country's sovereignty," Thomas W. Tsai, chairman of the Chinese
Taipei Olympic Committee (CTOC), said at a late night news conference.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Yang Jong-her, minister of the Cabinet-level
National Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, echoed Tsai's view, saying the
arrangement announced by Beijing downgrades Taiwan's status as an independent
sovereign state because Taipei is included as a leg on China's domestic route.</P>
      <P>A senior official of the Mainland Affairs Council, which charts Taiwan's policy
toward China, also described Beijing's proposal as the worst route. "Beijing was
simply trying to belittle Taiwan, " said the official who preferred anonymity.</P>
      <P>Taiwan wanted the torch to come from a third country and leave for another third
country, the official said, adding that Hong Kong is considered part of China
and that Taiwan cannot accept the relay through the former British colony back
to Beijing.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time since the Olympic torch relay was inaugurated for the
1920 Brussels Olympic Games that an IOC member has rejected being part of the
torch relay.</P>
      <P>CTOC Chairman Tsai said protests will be lodged with Beijing and with the IOC.
"An adjustment to the route is necessary," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>As the IOC has already approved the Beijing-proposed relay route, analysts said,
it's up to Beijing to resolve whether and how the route will be changed. "The
ball is in Beijing's court, " an analyst said.</P>
      <P>According to the analyst, Beijing could easily settle the issue by agreeing to
have the torch come to Taipei from Pyongyang, North Korea before heading to Ho
Chi Minh City.</P>
      <P>Given Beijing's obstinate opposition of refusing to treat Taiwan on an equal
footing, the analyst said he is not optimistic about the prospect of Beijing
making any concession on this issue.</P>
      <P>After announcing the torch relay route in Beijing Thursday evening, Jiang
Xiaoyu, executive vice president of the Beijing Olympic organizing committee,
repeatedly referred to Taipei, Hong Kong and Macau as "overseas Chinese cities"
and stressed that they were not included as part of the relay's international
route.</P>
      <P>Taiwan returned to the IOC in 1981 under the name of "Chinese Taipei" after a
10-year hiatus following its ouster from the United Nations in 1971.</P>
      <P>Sports and political analysts reminded the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee that
it should carefully handle subsequent issues besides seeking a change to the
torch relay route. It should not overlook the possibility of being denied IOC
membership following its snub of the 2008 torch relay, they cautioned.</P>
      <P>Sports minister Yang said that although Taiwan rejects the planned arrival of
the torch, Taiwan athletes will by no means be absent from the Beijing Olympic
Games to be held next summer. Asked whether Taiwan would pull out of the games
if Beijing were again to deliberately make discriminatory moves to downgrade
Taiwan's status, Yang said he couldn't answer such hypothetical questions.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the government's torch relay snub, Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) legislative whip Ker Chien-ming said he is convinced that Taiwan is better
off rejecting the offer since the Olympic torch has become a "political torch."</P>
      <P>In contrast, the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) issued a statement late
Thursday night saying that politics should be kept out of sports.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin, a KMT stalwart, said he feels deep regret over the
DPP administration's decision to refuse to allow Taiwan to be part of the torch
relay.</P>
      <P>"I hope the government will change its mind and agree with the inclusion of
Taipei in the relay route, " Hau said, adding that the government should not mix
sports and politics, which he claimed only damages Taiwan's international image
and reputation.</P>
      <P>Wu Ching-kuo, Taiwan's member in the International Olympic Committee who is now
in Beijing to attend IOC activities there, also expressed "shock and regret"
over Taiwan's rebuff, saying he hopes remedies can still be worked out.</P>

      <P>Taipei's top-end residential properties are the sixth most expensive among those
of 16 major cities around the world, according to a survey released Thursday by
a local real estate brokerage company.</P>
      <P>The survey conducted by Century 21 Real Estate shows that top-end housing prices
in Taipei average more than NT$600,000 (US$18,127) per ping (3.3 square meters)
, ranking behind London's NT$3.6 million, Paris's NT$1.31 million, Seoul's 1.25
million, Sydney's NT$830,000 and Vancouver's NT$660,000.</P>
      <P>Ranking from seventh to 16th on the list are: Athens' NT$560,000, New York's

Bogota's NT$137,000 and Mexico City's NT$86,000.</P>
      <P>The survey found that in cities with a high population density, such as Taipei,
Paris and Singapore, top-end housing tends to be smaller in size and located
closer to the downtown area, with the commuting time ranging between 10 minutes
and 20 minutes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION CONDEMNS TAIWAN'S REJECTION OF OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  27  (CNA)
04/27/07  15:36:00

    <TEXT>
      <P>Members of the opposition parties condemned  Friday  the  Democratic
Progressive  Party  (DPP) administration's rejection of Beijing's proposed route
for the 2008 Olympic torch relay, saying that the government is unilaterally
barring the Olympic torch from passing through Taiwan for ideological reasons.</P>
      <P>Hsu Shao-ping,  a whip of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) legislative caucus,
said that Taiwan has been concerned that it is increasingly being marginalized
in the international community. Nevertheless, she continued, rejecting the
passage of the 2008 Olympic torch through Taiwan for political reasons will only
do Taiwan a disservice by seriously damaging the country's image in the
international community.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-hsiung,  an Olympic  silver medalist-turned  KMT legislator,
expressed his concern that the rejection may cause the International Olympic
Committee (IOC) to punish Taiwan by repealing Taiwan's membership in the IOC,
consequently leaving Taiwan athletes out of the Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>If that were to occur, Huang asserted, the DPP government should take all the
responsibility.</P>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday that Beijing's proposed route for the 2008
Olympic torch relay is unacceptable to Taiwan, adding that Taiwan's sovereign
status should not be undermined under any circumstances.</P>
      <P>Commenting on China's plan that the Olympic torch would travel from Vietnam's Ho
Chi Minh City to Taipei and then continue on to Hong Kong, Macau and several
other Chinese cities before arriving in the host city, Beijing, Su said at the
Legislative Yuan that Taiwan belongs to the International  Olympic Committee
(IOC)  as an independent sports entity and has taken part in Olympic
competitions on an equal footing for years.</P>
      <P>Yang Jong-her, Minister of the National Council on Physical Fitness and Sports,
and Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee Chairman Thomas W. Tsai also said shortly
after the Beijing's announcement Thursday that the torch relay route was
unacceptable on the grounds that Taiwan's  sovereign  status would be
compromised  as the Beijing-proposed torch relay route purposely includes Taipei
as part of the "domestic leg" of the relay.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the government officials' remarks, KMT Legislator Yang Li-huan
said that Taiwan should grasp every possible opportunity to gain exposure on the
world stage and that the Olympic torch relay would provide Taiwan with an
opportunity to expand its tourism. "Taiwan should open itself to the world,
rather than shutting itself off," Yang added.</P>
      <P>Kuo Su-chun, a deputy whip of the KMT legislative caucus, suggested that a
nationwide referendum be held to gauge the Taiwan public's opinions on whether
Taiwan should accept the Beijing torch relay route or not.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee Hung-chun, a spokesman for the opposition People First Party,
attributed the DPP government's rejection of the Beijing-proposed torch relay
route to the DPP's preparation for the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lee said he believes that in order to consolidate its support base for the 2008
presidential election, the DPP must alienate itself from the international
community as well as China.</P>
      <P>Lee said he wonders how the DPP will explain to the international community the
reasons for rejecting the Beijing-proposed Olympic torch relay route.</P>
      <P>The DPP government owes an explanation to the Taiwan public and the world over
this issue, Lee added.</P>
      <P>He urged the government not to sacrifice Taiwan athletes' rights on the world
sports stage because of politics.</P>

      <P>A Taipei city government official said Friday that a bus driver who posted
online the contents of videotapes from the bus video camera had broken the law
by violating the privacy of the passengers.</P>
      <P>Loh Hsiao-hsien, director of Taipei city government's Department of
Transportation, made the remarks after a public bus driver working for Shin-Shin
Bus Corp. posted the video content on the Internet.</P>
      <P>The bus driver argued that he made the video to protect himself in the event of
disputes with passengers or misconduct by passengers. He added that he did it
mainly to change the public's impression of bus drivers.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that the video content from the monitors is usually offered by bus
companies to judicial authorities when there is an accident or dispute between
drivers and passengers.</P>
      <P>However, the Shin-Shin Bus driver posted the video content on the Internet, and
the video has now become entertainment for Web browsers, Chen said, adding that
this has seriously violated the passengers' privacy.</P>
      <P>Liu Chi-hwa, general manager of Shin-Shin Bus Corp., said that his company's

      <P>Chen urged all managers of bus companies to improve their supervision of their
drivers, adding that, otherwise, any misbehavior by their drivers will result in
demerits for the bus companies in their evaluation reports.</P>

      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang urged the Legislative Yuan Friday to pass a draft law on
the national pension program as soon as possible to facilitate an early start to
the program.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the program will provide a complete system to take care of
disadvantaged citizens, Su said the Cabinet will finalize the bill next week and
submit it to the legislature for review.</P>
      <P>However, Su would not indicate if the government will increase the monthly
allowance for elderly farmers in the event of the bill failing to pass the
legislature.</P>
      <P>If the law is not enacted, the government has a responsibility to take some
other measures to take care of disadvantaged citizens, especially elderly
farmers, he said.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks during a question period in the Legislative Yuan,
when asked to comment on President Chen Shui-bian's proposal that the monthly
allowance for elderly farmers be raised by NT$1,000 (US$30.12) to NT$6,000 if
the national pension bill does not pass the legislature by July.</P>
      <P>Cabinet spokesman Chen Mei-ling said Thursday that the Executive Yuan will not
hike the monthly allowance for elderly farmers even if the law is not enacted by
July, sparking speculation that there are differences between the Cabinet and
the president on the issue.</P>
      <P>Currently, three kinds of monthly allowances are provided for senior citizens 65
or over: NT$3,000 per month for those who have registered their households in
Taiwan and have lived in the country for more than 183 days per year over the
past three years and who are not receiving government-subsidized shelter
placement or retirement pensions for military personnel; NT$5,000 per month for
those who made a living from farming or fishing; and between NT$3,000 and
NT$6,000 per month for low-income families.</P>
      <P>Officials tallies show that the government paid out NT$71.2 billion between
January and November 2006 in allowances for the senior citizens, with the number
of beneficiaries totalling 1.63 million.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Local officials in charge of health affairs from around the country gathered
Friday at the Kaohsiung city hall for a national working meeting to review
efforts in the prevention and control of dengue fever outbreaks.</P>
      <P>The annual event came three months earlier this year after signs appeared
showing that the mosquito-born disease has been well placed to create an
outbreak on the island since the beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>According to statistics of the Department of Health (DOH) -- the meeting
organizer -- 16 indigenous cases of dengue were recorded Jan. 1 - April 24, and
a further 22 cases were imported during that period.</P>
      <P>It is necessary for Taiwan to hold meetings of this kind earlier than usual
schedule, said Lin Ting, deputy director of the Center for Disease Control,
explaining that World Health Organization online data show increasing dengue
outbreaks in countries in Southeast Asia and Latin America.</P>
      <P>Taiwan needs to be well prepared in the face of the possible inflow of overseas
dengue virus and to strengthen its risk management against viral stowaways, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>The working meeting was presided over by DOH chief Hou Sheng-mou, who said in
his address to the event that he is confident in existing dengue prevention and
control measures.</P>
      <P>Over the past years Taiwan has been successful in stemming outbreaks of dengue
fever. That success has been most obvious in Kaohsiung county, southern Taiwan,
one of the most dengue-affected areas of the country. In 2002 the county was hit
by over 1,900 dengue cases, but five years later, only 185 cases were reported,
according to the DOH.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung County Magistrate Wu Yu-wen attributed the successful disease control
to cooperation between the Kaohsiung county and city in efforts to wipe off
sources of disease-carrying mosquitoes.</P>
      <P>However, Wu suggested that governments must continue to make a coordinated
effort to reinforce and promote the strategy of "regional joint defense" in the
fight against dengue epidemics.</P>
      <P>Dengue fever is a flu-like viral disease spread by the bite of infected
mosquitoes which often breed in stagnant water close to human dwellings.</P>
      <P>The disease usually begins suddenly and is characterized by high fever, rash,
severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, accompanied by
nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite. It may take a month for a patient to
recover.</P>
      <P>The most severe and potentially fatal infection by the virus is the hemorrhagic
type.</P>

answer session at the Legislative Yuan that Taiwan and China have engaged in
five rounds of talks on the matter and he believes that cross-strait
negotiations over the issue have entered the final stage.</P>
      <P>It is now up to Beijing to determine when Chinese citizens will be allowed to
travel to Taiwan for sightseeing this year, Chen said, adding that so long as
Beijing gives a green light, the program could be implemented within the year.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in response to opposition Kuomintang Legislator Huang
Chien-ting, who said that Chinese tourists would be a major force helping to rev
up Taiwan's sagging tourism and asked Chen when the government will open
Taiwan's doors to Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Also answering questions at the Legislative Yuan on this issue, Premier Su
Tseng-chang said that welcoming Chinese citizens to make sightseeing tour of
Taiwan is an established governmental policy, although some related issues,
including the exercise of Taiwan government's public authority, should first be
discussed.</P>

pointing out that welcoming the Chinese in no way minimizes Taiwan's resolve to
attract more tourists from around the world.</P>

      <P>If moving will provide benefits, then the ministry will support it, but if a
relocation proves not to be feasible, then the company should explain to the

announced  that Taiwan will re-establish diplomatic relations with St. Lucia.</P>
      <P>The premier, while meeting a supporter group in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan, said
Wednesday night that St. Lucia has become Taiwan's 25th diplomatic ally after
St. Lucia's Minister of Foreign Affairs announced the news. He described the
resumption of diplomatic ties with St. Lucia as one of the most encouraging news
events since he assumed the premiership early last year.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks during an interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan
when asked about questions Vice President Annette Lu raised concerning Su's
appropriateness of his announcement of the resumption of diplomatic ties, which
is properly the domain of President Chen Shui-bian. Lu also said that Su's act
aimed at currying favor with the voters.</P>
      <P>Both Su and Lu are bidding to become the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's

"share the good news with the public."</P>

      <P>Su noted that St. Lucia's Foreign Minister Rufus Bousquet said Wednesday morning
that the nation intends to establish diplomatic ties with Taiwan, although it
did not rule out maintaining relations with China.</P>
      <P>Foreign media also reported the news later that day, meaning that it was by no
means a secret, he added.</P>
      <P>He stressed that diplomatic policy is with the purview of the president and that
the resumption of diplomatic relations with St. Lucia has been the result of
efforts by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister James Huang expressed the hope Thursday that the two
nations can sign a communique marking the official re-establishment of ties as
soon as possible and said his ministry is working to complete all the relevant
follow-up procedures.</P>
      <P>The east Caribbean nation first established diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1984,
but then switched diplomatic recognition to China in 1997.</P>

      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday that Taiwan would not take part in the 2008
Beijing Olympic Games if China insisted on referring to the country as "Taipei,
China, " instead of the more commonly used "Chinese Taipei."</P>
      <P>Su said the reference "Taipei,  China" would represent  a downgrading of
Taiwan's status as a sovereign country, a situation which he said is totally
unacceptable to the government.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan would never participate in the Games only to be dwarfed and humiliated,
" Su said during a question and answer session in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The government has rejected China's offer to include the island on the Olympic
torch-relay route on the grounds that Beijing's proposed route purposely
downgrades Taiwan's status to that of a local administrative region of China.</P>
      <P>According to China's plan, the Olympic torch would travel from Vietnam's Ho Chi

      <P>A group of scholars and professionals appealed to the major political parties
Friday to change the goverment's system to a parliamentary system through the
implementation of constitutional amendments.</P>
      <P>Lu Ya-li, professor emeritus of Political Science at National Taiwan University,
and Chou Yan-shan, professor of political science at the Chinese Cultural
University in Taipei, urged the ruling and opposition parties of the legislature
to initiate a motion to revise the Constitution and change the system of
government.</P>
      <P>Claiming that their opinions represent those of more than a hundred political
science scholars and professionals, Lu and Chou said the general provisions of
the current constitution, which deals with the sensitive issues of the country's
name and territory, should remain intact.</P>
      <P>However, they said at a news conference the central government's system should
be converted to a parliamentary system, with its members chosen by a popular
election system under which the voters cast one ballot for their favorite
candidates and one for their favorite political parties.</P>
      <P>They also called for an relaxation of the current criteria for amending the
Constitution.</P>
      <P>Noting that both the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the major
opposition Kuomintang have been in favor of a system of parliamentary
government, Lu and Chou urged them to come up jointly with a motion for
constitution revisions before May 5 and put it to a national referendum held in
conjunction with either the legislative elections at the year end or the

      <P>Nearly 80 percent of respondents to a recent survey opined that the proposed
raise of the minimum monthly wage to NT$17,000 (US$511) is still insufficient to
improve the lives of socially less privileged workers.</P>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) publicized Friday the results of the

the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) labor policies since it took

      <P>The poll shows that 80.7 percent of respondents agreed that the DPP government's
efforts to bolster the economic development of the country over the past seven
years did not profit workers by raising their wages in the least.</P>
      <P>Moreover, 76.7 percent of those surveyed thought the employment market had been
unstable over the past few years and that the instability was still increasing.</P>
      <P>The survey shows that the postgraduates appeared more concerned about employment

      <P>According to Beijing's announcement, the Olympic torch would arrive in Taipei

      <P>According to the reports, during that meeting President Chen was indignant about
the possible arrangement of the torch either entering or leaving Taiwan from

Wall Street Journal: How Motorola Fell A Giant Step Behind, As It Milked Thin
Phone, Rivals Sneaked Ahead On the Next Generation

A year ago, Motorola Inc. appeared headed for a third straight year of rich
profits under Chief Executive Ed Zander, driven by its hit cellphone the Razr.
But behind the scenes, Motorola was working furiously to get a successor phone
to market by the second half of 2006, according to people familiar with the
matter. When it failed to do so, profit margins on handsets narrowed and the
company swung to a loss. Motorola's travails illustrate the risks for a company
that rides high with a big consumer hit. Amid its success with the Razr, it fell
behind on developing a phone with the next generation of technology. Missing a
beat is especially hazardous in cellphones, where it can take two to three years
to develop a new line.</TEXT>

      <P>The government's decision to refuse to allow the Olympic torch relay of the 2008
Beijing Olympic Games to pass through Taiwan was made after group discussions
and not by any individual, Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday.</P>
      <P>Su said after a Legislative Yuan session that the National Security Council
(NSC), the Mainland Affairs Council, the National Council on Physical Fitness
and Sports and the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee met to discuss the issue
before deciding that the proposed route planned by China "dwarfed Taiwan's
status."</P>
      <P>The NSC then reported the decision to President Chen Shui-bian before notifying
the Chinese Olympic Committee in Beijing and the International Olympic Committee
(IOC), Su said.</P>
      <P>Su insisted that China's moves of downgrading Taiwan's sovereignty in the route
plan will not be accepted by the government, including a name change from the
commonly used title "Chinese Taipei" to "Taipei, China" and calling the relay
route from Taipei to Hong Kong a domestic route rather than an international
one.</P>
      <P>Taiwan rejected the plan to guard its sovereignty and rights as an independent
sports entity in the Olympic games, Su added.</P>
      <P>He said the government will come up with solutions to deal with the consequences
following Taiwan's refusal of the route plan, such as the possibility of being
denied IOC membership.</P>

      <P>The European Chamber of Commerce in Taiwan (ECCT) expressed approval Friday of
the government's sincerity in making efforts to improve the investment
environment.</P>
      <P>ECCT  representatives  made  the remarks  after  a two-day government-ECCT
annual coordination meeting, co-chaired by Thomas M.F. Yeh, vice chairman of the
Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), and ECCT
Chairman Ralf Scheller.</P>
      <P>Discussions in the meeting focused on issues listed in the ECCT 2006-2007 report
of its proposals for the government.</P>
      <P>The ECCT participants praised the authorities' efforts in the past year to
answer various calls from the business organization, including those for an
amendment to the Civil Aviation Act to allow liberalization  of the aviation
market,  reinforced efforts in intellectual property rights protection and the
formation of the National Communications Commission.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the European business representatives expressed concern over the
promotion of cross-Taiwan Strait trading, as well as other issues concerning
whether Taiwan will remove excessive economic restrictions, accelerate the
development of the service sector and build a preferential taxation system.</P>
      <P>While some of the issues touch political concerns, the government will adopt a
deliberate attitude in dealing with the ECCT's requests, Yeh said, adding that
the CEPD will continue efforts to push for solutions in an open manner.</P>
      <P>The CEPD was commissioned to serve as the coordinator between the government and
foreign chambers of commerce in 1997, working to promote communication and
assist foreign businesses in resolving investment problems.</P>
      <P>According to the CEPD, there is a close bond between the Taiwanese and European
trade and economic sectors, with statistics showing that bilateral trade
amounted to 40 billion euros in 2006.</P>
      <P>European Union investment in Taiwan reached US$14.6 billion last year, making it
the largest foreign investor and the country's fourth-largest trade partner,
according to CEPD tallies.</P>

      <P>An official with the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games organizing committee claimed
Friday that Games organizers had discussed the route for the 2008 Olympic torch
relay with Taiwan's top Olympic delegate and reached a consensus on the part
concerning Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Jiang Xiaoyu, an executive deputy chairman of the Olympics, called a news

Olympic Committee Chairman Thomas W. Tsai, during which a four-point consensus

Jiang added.</P>
      <P>Jiang claimed that Tsai signed the minutes to endorse the consensus on the 2008

would travel from Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City to Taipei and then continue on to
Hong Kong, Macau and several other Chinese cities before arriving in the host

Beijing's proposal about Taiwan's role or place in the torch relay," he said.</P>
      <P>While both sides pledged in the minutes that Taiwan should be called "Chinese
Taipei" as its official designation in the IOC, Tsai said Beijing officials and
Chinese journalists and media executives have typically  referred to Taiwan as
"Taipei,  China" --  a characterization they feel makes it sound as if Taiwan
were part of China.</P>
      <P>Without elaboration, Tsai further said that over the past month, Beijing's
attempts to describe Taiwan as a province under its jurisdiction  have even
become ever more evident in bilateral engagements.</P>
      <P>"During the period, we have on many occasions expressed our stance and bottom
line to Beijing. Without Beijing's positive response to our request and for the

Chi Minh City-Taipei-Hong Kong relay route," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>In an April 24 response to Tsai, the Beijing Olympic Committee failed to promise

arrangement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.N. BID UNDER NAME OF TAIWAN `DIFFICULT': EX-FOREIGN MINISTER</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan's bid to apply to join the United Nations under the name of "Taiwan"
involves great difficulty, a former Republic of China minister of foreign
affairs said Friday.</P>
      <P>Addressing the issue during a conference titled "Taiwan and Its Contexts" held
at Yale University, Fredrick Chien said the ROC has been "unfairly and
unreasonably"  ignored by the international community since its seat at the
United Nations was replaced by the People's Republic of China in 1971.</P>
      <P>While promoting a campaign to re-enter the United Nations over the past 14
years, Taiwan has not tried to challenge Beijing's representation  at the United
Nations but has emphasized  the "unfairness" of the world organization excluding
Taiwan, Chien said.</P>
      <P>According to Chien, "it will be a very difficult matter" if Taiwan is to apply
for U.N. membership under the name of "Taiwan" because Taiwan must be a "new
country" in order to enter the United Nations as a new member, which brings up
the issue of declaring independence.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chien pointed out, any application for new U.N. membership is
required to obtain the unanimous consent of the five permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council -- one of which is China.</P>
      <P>Therefore, "there will be a very big problem" if Taiwan is to apply to join the
United Nations under the name of "Taiwan" this September, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, analyzing the democratic development of Taiwan at the conference, Chu
Yun-han, a professor of political science at National Taiwan University, said
the problems of partisan struggle and split national identity in Taiwan are not
expected to be resolved in the near future.</P>
      <P>While the people hinged high expectations on President Chen Shui-bian when he
was elected in 2000 and again in 2004, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) has failed to obtain a majority status in the Legislative Yuan in the past
two legislative elections, Chu noted.</P>
      <P>Despite this fact, the DPP has refused to relinquish the right to appoint the
premier, resulting in a continuation of confrontation between the ruling and
opposition camps, Chu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>7.5-9.5% MINIMUM WAGE HIKE EXCEEDS `ACCEPTABLE RANGE': MOEA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The minimum monthly wage adjustment range recommended by a wage review committee
goes beyond the level acceptable to bosses, Economics Minister Steve R.L. Chen
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after the wage review panel under the Cabinet-level
Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) recommended the day before that the minimum
monthly wage be raised by 7.5 percent to 9.5 percent, pending final approval by
the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has been in close contact with
major industrial and business associations and senior business executives in the
past few weeks in the hope of winning their support for a hike in the minimum
wage.</P>
      <P>"After difficult negotiations, they have finally agreed to a maximum 5 percent
hike. Perhaps, a 6 percent hike is a barely tolerable ceiling. The recommended
figures go far beyond the range bosses are willing to pay," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting  that  franchised  stores,  small-  and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
and micro-businesses are usually most vulnerable to a minimum wage hike, Chen
said the ministry will step up communications with various business associations
to seek their support.</P>
      <P>Moreover,  Chen said, the ministry will flesh out various complementary packages
of measures to help the industrial and business community weather challenges
that may arise from the impending wage hikes.</P>
      <P>Among the measures in contemplation are offering soft loans through the SME
Development Fund as well as organizing on-the-job manpower  training  programs
to help small-  and medium-sized enterprises upgrade productivity and
competitiveness, Chen said.</P>
      <P>CLA Chairman Lee Ying-yuan chaired a meeting of the wage review committee Friday
to discuss the issue.</P>
      <P>Lee said the 22 members  on the panel --  comprised  of representatives from
employers' associations, labor unions, academics and government officials --
came to a compromise after more than three hours of heated debate and intensive
consultations.</P>
      <P>While labor groups sought a steep 20 percent hike in the minimum monthly wage in
light of soaring living costs and a 10-year freeze of the minimum wage level,
employer representatives attempted to limit the rise to between 5 percent and 6
percent.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the conference goers settled the proposed hike at a range between
7.5 percent and 9.5 percent after using the 7.5 percent increase in the consumer
price index over the past decade.</P>
      <P>An estimated 1.7 million low-wage workers are expected to benefit from the
adjustment, Lee said.</P>
      <P>At Friday's meeting, the panel also decided to change the formula for
calculating wages for part-time workers whose average wage per hour will rise to
between NT$93 and NT$95 from the current NT$66.</P>
      <P>Lee said the CLA will submit the package to the Cabinet for a final review. "We
are hopeful that the wage hike can be implemented from July 1," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC REBUTS BEIJING'S ACCUSATION ABOUT OLYMPIC TORCH CONSENSUS</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's refusal to be included in the Beijing-proposed route for next year's
Olympic torch relay is an issue of "sovereignty" and "respect" rather than of
"credibility or routing," a senior official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Liu Te-hsun made the remarks after
Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2008 Olympic Games (BOCOG) Vice President
Jiang Xiaoyu accused Taiwan the day before of "breach of commitment" by reneging
on a previous agreement to host a leg of next year's Olympic torch relay.</P>
      <P>Jiang said he was surprised at Taiwan's snub of China's proposal that the
Olympic flame would arrive in Taipei from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam before
heading to China-controlled Hong Kong and Macau.</P>
      <P>Jiang claimed that the BOCOG had been discussing the relay issue with Taiwan
sports officials since November and received a letter detailing Taipei's
agreement to the route March 27.</P>
      <P>However, Liu rebutted Jiang's claim by elaborating on the negotiation process
over the torch relay.</P>
      <P>Liu said that on Feb. 12, Taiwan's Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee (CTOC)
Chairman Thomas W. Tsai traveled to Beijing to meet with his Chinese counterpart
and was given a briefing on the torch relay route. Tsai was told that the
Olympic torch would be entering Taipei from Vietnam before leaving for Hong
Kong.</P>
      <P>Tsai presented Beijing's proposal to the government authorities, and on March
27, Tsai sent a letter to BOCOG saying the CTOC would not object to the plan as
long as China refrains from using it to belittle Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Over the past month, Liu claimed, Beijing has changed its tune. "We have
discovered that China started spreading propaganda claiming that Taiwan would be
the Olympic torch's first leg on the `interior route.' Worse still, China has
typically referred to Taiwan as `Taipei, China' instead of using its formal
designation in the International Olympic Committee (IOC) of `Chinese Taipei, '"
he added.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, Olympic committees on both sides of the Taiwan Strait reached
a consensus in 1989 that Taiwan should be addressed as "Chinese Taipei" when it
takes part in IOC-sponsored competitions and activities in China.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, Liu said, Chinese officials and media personalities have not
observed  that accord while talking  about the 2008 Olympics-related activities.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Liu said, the CTOC sent a letter to Beijing again April
20 protesting its abuse of the torch relay route for political manipulation and
stressing that Taiwan could not accept China's attempt to downgrade its
sovereign status.</P>
      <P>To avoid a situation in which the Olympic torch might be described as traveling
from "Taipei, China" to "Hong Kong, China, " Liu said the CTOC requested in its
April 20 letter that the flame enter and exit Taiwan via third countries.</P>
      <P>"However, Beijing ignored our request and announced the route Thursday, " Liu
said, adding that Taiwan was surprised at Beijing's announcement.</P>
      <P>For the sake of safeguarding Taiwan's sovereignty and national dignity, Liu
said, Taiwan must reject the Beijing-dictated torch relay route.</P>
      <P>In the process, Liu said, the CTOC has approached the IOC for assistance,
calling attention to Taiwan's plight that Beijing is deliberately attempting to
belittle Chinese Taipei -- an independent member of the IOC -- as an integral
part of China.</P>
      <P>At the moment, Liu said, Taiwan will not rule out the possibility of hosting a
leg of the relay, although it requires further discussion.</P>
      <P>The Olympic flame has come to Taiwan only once -- in 1964 for the Tokyo Olympic
Games. President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that Beijing should consider the
relay route that Japan used in 1964, which entailed having the flame travel to
Taiwan from a third country and then passing it on to another third country.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is becoming a learning-oriented society, attributed to a mushrooming of

      <P>A recommended minimum monthly wage hike of 7.5 percent to 9.5 percent goes
beyond the level acceptable to bosses, the National Association of Small and
Medium Enterprises said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Association President Lin Ping-pin made the remarks one day after the Council of
Labor Affairs (CLA) convened a wage review committee to decide the level of
adjustment, which will be sent to the Executive Yuan for approval. CLA Chairman
Lee Ying-yuan noted that since the consumer price index has risen by 7.5 percent
over the past decade and the minimum monthly wage has not increased at all in
the same period, the hike should be at least 7.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Lin said the increase is higher that the maximum level of 5 percent acceptable
to bosses.</P>
      <P>Lin argued that while the consumer price index has "only" risen by 7.5 percent,
the shortened working hours and a new labor pension system that was put into
practice last July have incurred a 30 percent increase in expenses for
employers.</P>
      <P>He claimed that many small- and medium-sized enterprises will have to close if
there is a 7.5 percent minimum wage increase and that if they do, jobs will also
decrease.</P>
      <P>Under the new pension system, employers must deposit at least 6 percent of an
employee's salary into their pension account each month, which the employees can
carry with them whenever they change jobs. Under the old system, an employee
would get his or her pension after working for 25 consecutive years for the same
enterprise or when they reached the age of 55 years and had worked for the same
company for 15 consecutive years.</P>
      <P>Also under the old system, employees would receive their pension in one lump
sum, while under the new system, retired workers are eligible to receive a
monthly pension for the rest of their lives.</P>

      <P>The monitoring indicators for Taiwan's economic climate flashed a green light
for March, signalling steady growth, according to a report released Friday by
the Council for Economic Development and Planning (CEPD).</P>
      <P>The total monitoring score gained four points from 19 in February to 23 in
March, with the indicators turning from yellow-blue that indicated a slowdown in
February, CEPD officials said.</P>
      <P>The change marked the first green light for the last nine months since May 2006,
the official said.</P>
      <P>Among the nine component indicators, three showed improvement, namely bank
clearings and remittances,  exports and industrial production, they said.</P>
      <P>The composite index of leading indicators -- a barometer for the economy's
outlook in the coming three months -- stood at 109.4 in March, up 0.9 percent
from the month-earlier level, they said.</P>
      <P>Among the seven indicators comprising the composite index, six made  positive
contributions,  including  new orders  for the manufacturing sector, customs-
cleared exports, money supply M1B, wholesale price change from six months
earlier, average work hours in the manufacturing sector and stock prices,
according to the CEPD.</P>
      <P>The index of coincident indicators, which represents the current economic
situation, registered 110.2 in March, up 1.1 percent from February, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>Among the six indicators making up the index, five made positive contributions,
including bank clearings, manufacturing production, industrial production,
manufacturing sales and average monthly earnings of manufacturing workers, they
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a CEPD survey of manufacturers in March indicated that 14 percent of
the respondents expected conditions to improve over the next three months, down
from 29 percent in a February survey.</P>
      <P>A total of 13 percent of the respondents  predicted that conditions will be
worse, up from 8 percent in the previous month, while 73 percent said they think

      <P>Officials of the Government Information Office (GIO) said Saturday that they
have informed the world press regarding Taiwan's refusal to be included in
China's "domestic route" in the 2008 Beijing Olympic Game's torch relay.</P>
      <P>The officials said that in order to clarify Taiwan's stance, GIO personnel
informed the world's major media as soon as Taipei decided to reject being
included in the 2008 Olympic torch relay route.</P>
      <P>The Chinese Olympics organizers announced Thursday that Taipei would be included
as a leg in the torch relay's "domestic" route. According to Beijing's
announcement, the Olympic torch would arrive in Taipei from Ho Chi Minh City,
Vietnam before heading to the China-controlled areas of Hong Kong and Macau.</P>
      <P>While unveiling the route, Jiang Xiaoyu, executive vice president of the Beijing
Olympic organizing committee, referred to Taipei alongside with Hong Kong and
Macau as "overseas Chinese cities, " a description that downgrades Taiwan's
sovereign status.</P>
      <P>Taipei, indignant at being "downgraded" to the level of a Chinese province,
insisted that the Olympic torch must enter and depart Taiwan via a country other
than China.</P>
      <P>According to information collected by GIO personnel stationed around the world,
a total of 25 major news media had reported the issue, with Japanese media
accounting for the largest coverage, followed by other Asian media.</P>
      <P>GIO officials said the majority of the world news media had reported objectively
on the Taiwan government's stance and the situation between the two sides of
Taiwan Strait, and that few made any editorial comments. An AP report said the
episode underscores the deep mistrust between Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>Due to the objective coverage of the issue, there has been no damage to Taiwan's
image related to its rejection of the torch relay, the officials said.</P>

      <P>The government will not interfere in civic exchanges between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait, but insists that such exchanges be conducted under the law
and that issues involving public rights and power be dealt with by the
government, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Tung Chen-yuan said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Tung made the declaration at a Taiwan Thinktank conference while talking about a
high-profile Beijing forum hosted by the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the
Communist Party of China (CPC).</P>
      <P>The two-day cross-strait economic, trading and cultural forum opened earlier in
the day in Beijing, with KMT honorary Chairman Lien Chan and CPC General
Secretary Hu Jintao attending the opening ceremony. It is the third forum of its
kind since they began in 2005.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the event, Tung said the conclusions from the forum will still
serve as nothing but a channel of propaganda for the KMT and CPC, as the forum
will have no direct dialogue between government officials.</P>
      <P>However, he also said Beijing often takes advantage of the forum's informal
conclusions in an attempt to sow dissent in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Expressing hope that Beijing will stop disturbing Taiwan's politics and delaying
real cross-strait talks, Tung said there are several issues on which authorized
talks are currently taking place. The two sides could reach agreement on the
issues eventually if they continue negotiations, he noted.</P>
      <P>Tung also reiterated the government's determination to maintain the status quo
in the Taiwan Strait and Taiwan's democratic system, as well as the hopes of the
Taiwan people for cross-strait peace.</P>

      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Saturday that he regrets the attacks on him by his
three rivals in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) primary for the
2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The premier, one of the frontrunners in the primary, made the remarks while
attending a clam festival in Yunlin County a day after Vice President Annette
Lu, former Premier Frank Hsieh and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun, held a news
conference to accuse Su of misusing national resources to aid his campaign. Su
angrily denied the accusation.</P>
      <P>He described the "pork barrel" accusation from his rivals as lamentable, saying
he would only have expected such a slur from the main opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>He said the DPP supporters do not want to see internal strife in the party and
added that only solidarity within the party is needed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsieh told a supporters' group that "a fair" primary is crucial to
ensure that all aspirants can gladly accept the outcome. The primary will
consist of a member vote May 6 and a series of public opinion polls before it
announces the candidate later that month.</P>
      <P>Lu continued to question if President Chen Shui-bian is favoring any specific
hopeful prior to the primary, saying that Chen should "make his stance clear" as
"integrity is crucial for a national leader."</P>
      <P>In fact, President Chen has on a number of recent occasions clearly and
unequivocally professed his neutrality as regards the DPP aspirants.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang Toh, a party whip of the DPP in the legislature, accused all
four aspirants of campaigning as if they have lost their senses as the primary
draws near.</P>
      <P>"They should calm down, otherwise the DPP will have no hope of winning the
presidential election next year," he added.</P>
      <P>Former DPP Legislator Lin Cho-shui also said that the attacks on the premier by
his three rivals have DPP supporters worried.</P>
      <P>He also said DPP acting Chairman Trong Chai should refrain from attending news
conferences of the hopefuls Friday, saying that he should observe decorum as a
chairman instead of interfering in an election.</P>

      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Tung Chen-yuan said Saturday that
Taiwan would welcome the passage of the Olympic torch through the country but
rejects the intention of China downgrading Taiwan to the level of one of its
provinces.</P>
      <P>Tung made the remarks at a seminar held in Taipei on the 2008 Beijing Olympic
Games and cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Tung said it is an honor for Olympic member nations to have the torch pass
through their countries and that Taiwan would like to share this honor.</P>
      <P>However,  he  added,  Taiwan  opposes  Beijing's  political intervention in
sports affairs and the torch relay route proposed by Beijing.</P>
      <P>The Olympics organizers announced Thursday that Taipei would be included as a
leg on the torch relay's "domestic" route.</P>
      <P>According to Beijing's announcement, the Olympic torch would arrive in Taipei
from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam before heading to the China-controlled areas of
Hong Kong and Macau.</P>
      <P>Announcing the route, Jiang Xiaoyu, executive vice president of the Beijing
Olympic organizing committee, referred to Taipei, Hong Kong and Macau as
"overseas Chinese cities, " a description that downgrades Taiwan's sovereign
status.</P>
      <P>An indignant Taipei insisted that the Olympic torch must enter and depart Taiwan
via a country other than China.</P>
      <P>Tung noted that the Taiwan government has stated repeatedly that the torch
arrangement should adopt the Olympic courtesy by obtaining the approval of the
country through which the torch is scheduled to travel.</P>
      <P>According to Tung, Beijing Olympic Games organizing committee has since March
2005 included Taiwan in China's "domestic route" for the torch relay.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chinese officials and journalists have repeatedly referred to
Taiwan as "Taipei, China, " which Tung said violates the agreement reached
between the Chinese Olympic Committee and the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee
in 1989, in which both sides agreed to use "Chinese Taipei" when referring to
Taiwanese sports teams when they visit China.</P>

city's plan to transform the Easy Card into a kind of electronic money that can
be used at gas stations, convenience stores, or to pay for entrance to the City
Zoo.</P>
      <P>Hau made the call at an activity hosted by the Taipei Smart Card Corp. to
celebrate breaking the 9 million mark for issuance of the multi-purpose IC cards
for Taipei's mass rapid transport system, buses and parking lots.</P>
      <P>Hau expressed approval of the company's efforts, which have made Easy Card the
largest-circulation card of its kind in Taiwan, and the sixth-largest among
Asian cities. He said that in the near future when the cable car between the zoo
and the Maokung tea-production area in the Mucha district is inaugurated, people
can also use the card to pay for the cable car and for visits to the zoo.</P>
      <P>The city government has also been working with the Taipei County, Keelung City
and Taoyuan County in an effort to expand Easy Card applications to public
transport all over northern Taiwan, Hau added, noting that the city government
has also begun efforts to encourage the railway and high-speed railway system
operators to adopt the card.</P>
      <P>In the celebration, professional tennis players Chan Yung-jan and Chuang Chia-
jung, who reached the finals in the women's doubles in the Australia Open
earlier this year, touted the smart card and hosted a charity auction for
limited edition Easy Cards carrying their images.</P>

      <P>Several audit and cashier officials handling the "special allowance fund" of
several prominent figures of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party will be
questioned next week in a probe into alleged misuse of the fund, a special
investigation panel under the Supreme Prosecutors Office said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen Yun-nan, director of the panel, said that since those cases were assigned
to two teams of prosecutors earlier this month, the prosecutors have been
examining related evidence.</P>
      <P>"The prosecutors have yet to summon any of the defendants to explain their fund
use," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The indictment of former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who used to enjoy a
reputation as "Mr. Clean" until his indictment for alleged embezzlement of his
"special allowance fund" this February, has triggered a debate on the nature of
the fund given to senior officials around the country for their discretionary
use, a practice that has been going on for decades without anyone's questioning.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Hou Kuan-jen alleged that Ma misused half of the fund that went
directly into his personal banking accounts during his two-term mayorship
between 1998 and 2006. The indictment forced Ma to resign from the chairmanship
of the main opposition Kuomintang. Ma, who has denied any wrongdoing, has
registered to represent the party in the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>But another prosecutor in Tainan, in a similar probe of the "special allowance
fund" for Tainan Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair, dropped the case last month, saying that
half of the "special allowance fund" that went directly to the mayor's banking
accounts was an "actual subsidy."</P>
      <P>The Supreme Prosecutors Office will convene a meeting of the prosecutors in
early May to decide a coherent interpretation on the nature of the fund, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>But he also said the panel will investigate each case based on facts and
evidence and that the consensus reached at the meeting will only be used as a
reference and will not affect the probe into the current cases.</P>
      <P>All dossiers related to the alleged misuse of the fund of the DPP bigwigs were
turned over from the now defunct anti-corruption center to the special
investigation panel, which was formally inaugurated April 2.</P>
      <P>The panel also formally began probes April 14 into alleged discretionary fund
misuse cases involving the four DPP aspirants for the next presidency -- Vice
President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and
former Premier Frank Hsieh. Their cases were assigned to three prosecutors --
Hou Kuan-jen, Shen Ming-lun and Chou Shih-yu.</P>
      <P>Hou's team will also handle a similar case involving another DPP bigwig --
National Security Council Secretary-General Tan Sun Chen.</P>
      <P>The case involving Judicial Yuan President Weng Yueh-sheng's alleged
misappropriation of the "special allowance funds" budgeted for his discretionary
use will be handled by three prosecutors -- Chu Chao-liang, Wu Wen-chung and Lee
Hai-lung. Chu is the prosecutor who cleared the Tainan mayor.</P>

      <P>A memorial monument was unveiled by the Taipei municipal government at the
city's Sports Park Saturday to commemorate foreign workers who died on the job.</P>
      <P>Addressing the unveiling ceremony, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said many of the
city's landmark buildings  and public facilities, including Taipei 101 Tower and
the Metro mass rapid transit system, were completed with the assistance of many
foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>"Without their contributions, Taipei could not have developed its modern urban
style so quickly. Over the years, their sweat and labor have helped enhance our
city's beauty, grandeur, breadth and depth," Hau said emotionally, adding that
the city government has built the monument to express its gratitude for all
foreign workers who have sacrificed their lives in their work for Taiwan's
progress.</P>
      <P>The monument, dedicated to commemorate all foreign workers who died from
workplace accidents since 1991, is engraved with grateful words in many Asian
languages that read: "These venerable workers dedicate their precious lives.
They will be remembered by all city dwellers forever."</P>
      <P>The city government invited Buddhist monks from Thailand to perform religious
rituals and an Indonesian choir from the Bread of Life Christian Church to sing
hymns in praise of the God and pray for the souls of all deceased foreign
workers at the ceremony.</P>
      <P>The heads of representative offices of the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and
Vietnam were also invited to attend the monument unveiling ceremony. They joined
Hau and other city government officials in laying wreaths at the memorial
monument.</P>
      <P>According to Hau, Taipei now have more than 36,000 foreign workers, most of whom
work as caregivers or family helpers. Only a small portion of them work in the
manufacturing and construction sectors, with Thais accounting for the largest
ratio of these two categories of foreign workers.</P>
      <P>A total of 26 foreign workers have died from workplace accidents in Taipei City
since 1991, city officials said, adding that the city government will step up
workplace security inspection, education and publicity in order to minimize
workplace deaths and injuries.</P>

The Bush administration will not try to assess whether the troop increase in
Iraq is producing signs of political progress or greater security until
September, and many of Mr. Bushs top advisers now anticipate that any gains by
then will be limited, according to senior administration officials.

In interviews over the past week, the officials made clear that the White House
is gradually scaling back its expectations for the government of Prime Minister
Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. The timelines they are now discussing suggest that the
White House may maintain the increased numbers of American troops in Iraq well
into next year.

Wall Street Journal:The Debt Collector vs. The Widow

Heart surgery halted Viola Sue Kell's work sewing carpets in a rug mill in 2001.
It was the end of 40 years of cleaning motel rooms, restaurant jobs, "just hard
stuff," says Mrs. Kell, a 64-year -old widow. She applied for Social Security
disability, and her monthly $827 benefit now is her only income.

But when Mrs. Kell tried to pay her mortgage and electric bills in 2004, her
checks bounced. Every cent of the Social Security check, which went straight to
her bank each month, had been taken by a debt collector that had garnished her
bank account.That's not supposed to happen, but the practice is widespread and

      <P>The government remains firm on its stance that the Olympic torch for the 2008
Beijing Olympics should enter and exit Taiwan both via a third country if China
would include the island on the flame's relay route, an official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chou Jui, head of the office of the minister of the National Council on Physical
Fitness and Sports (NCPFS) , made the remarks after International Olympic
Committee (IOC) Chairman Jacques Rogge was quoted as having said in India
earlier in the day that he hopes Taiwan and China can settle their disputes over
the torch relay route through consultations.</P>
      <P>Beijing announced next year's Olympic torch relay route Thusday, in which Taipei
would be the 21st stop, behind Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City and before China-
controlled area of Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Within hours of Beijing's  announcement,  Taiwan explicitly rejected the
Vietnam-Taiwan-Hong Kong route, saying it implied Taiwan was part of China.</P>
      <P>Rogge refrained from giving direct comments on the dispute during his visit in
India Saturday. He instead said that the dust has not yet settled and that he
looks forward to seeing the two sides of the Taiwan Strait reach an agreement on
the issue through further talks.</P>
      <P>Responding to press inquiries about the NCPFS' views on Rogge's remarks, Chou
said the council cannot make any comment until after getting full information
about the IOC's position on the dispute.</P>
      <P>But he added that one thing is certain that the government will stick to its gun
that the Olympic torch to be acceptable to Taiwan must follow a "third country-
Taiwan-third country" route.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Tung Chen-yuan said earlier in the

worth."</TEXT>

      <P>The government remains firm on its stance that the Olympic torch for the 2008
Beijing Olympics should enter and exit Taiwan both via a third country if China
would include the island on the flame's relay route, an official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chou Jui, head of the office of the minister of the National Council on Physical
Fitness and Sports (NCPFS) , made the remarks after International Olympic
Committee (IOC) Chairman Jacques Rogge was quoted as having said in India
earlier in the day that he hopes Taiwan and China can settle their disputes over
the torch relay route through consultations.</P>
      <P>Beijing announced next year's Olympic torch relay route Thusday, in which Taipei
would be the 21st stop, behind Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City and before China-
controlled area of Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Within hours of Beijing's  announcement,  Taiwan explicitly rejected the
Vietnam-Taiwan-Hong Kong route, saying it implied Taiwan was part of China.</P>
      <P>Rogge refrained from giving direct comments on the dispute during his visit in
India Saturday. He instead said that the dust has not yet settled and that he
looks forward to seeing the two sides of the Taiwan Strait reach an agreement on
the issue through further talks.</P>
      <P>Responding to press inquiries about the NCPFS' views on Rogge's remarks, Chou
said the council cannot make any comment until after getting full information
about the IOC's position on the dispute.</P>
      <P>But he added that one thing is certain that the government will stick to its gun
that the Olympic torch to be acceptable to Taiwan must follow a "third country-
Taiwan-third country" route.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Tung Chen-yuan said earlier in the
day that Taiwan would welcome the passage of the Olympic torch through its
territory but reject the intention of China downgrading Taiwan to the level of
one of its provinces. The MAC charts Taiwan's policy toward China.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian lodged "a protest in the strongest terms" against the
secretariat of the World Health Organization (WHO) Sunday, saying that Taiwan's
bid to join the WHO is not an issue that could be denied or decided by the
secretariat or any individual working for the WHO.</P>
      <P>Taking the former East Germany as an example, Chen said whether Taiwan should be
admitted into the WHO as a full member is an issue that should be determined by
all member countries of the WHO.</P>
      <P>Chen appealed to the WHO Secretariat and WHO Director-General Margaret Chan to
handle Taiwan's accession bid in accordance with the WHO laws and spirit and
refer Taiwan's membership application to the World Health Assembly so that all
WHO members can discuss the issue and reach a decision when they meet in mid-
May.</P>
      <P>Chen made the call in his speech at the opening of a workshop on Taiwan's bid to
join the WHO under the name of Taiwan, marking the first and formal response to
the WHO Secretariat's reply to his letter dated April 11 to the WHO director-
general about Taiwan's membership bid.</P>
      <P>The WHO Secretariat responded in an April 25 letter to Chen by calling Taiwan's
application a "non-issue" and saying that after a thorough study and legal
consultation, the WHO had decided not to deal further with the issue, on the
grounds that Taiwan is ineligible to apply for membership, which requires
statehood recognized by the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The president reiterated that Taiwan is a sovereign state which has every right
to apply to join the world health regulatory body as a full member based on the
WHO's spirit of protecting the health of all peoples around the world and the
notion that medical care knows no borders.</P>
      <P>Noting that asking for a WHO membership is the exercise of collective human
rights of the 23 million Taiwanese people, Chen asserted that this is not a
matter that could be unilaterally denied or deprived of by the WHO Secretariat
or the WHO director-general.</P>
      <P>Chen quoted the WHO's organizational law as indicating that the WHO's membership
is open to all countries from around the world. He added that the procedural
rules of the World Health Assembly (WHA) -- the WHO's highest decision-making
unit -- have also stipulated that countries intending to apply for membership in
the WHO should submit its application to the WHO chief 30 days before the
convening of the next WHA and the WHO chief should then refer the application to
the WHA so that the application could be put on the WHA agenda for debate by all
member countries.</P>
      <P>He argued that whether Taiwan is a sovereign state and whether Taiwan is
entitled to applying for a full WHO membership are issues that should not be
decided unilaterally by the WHO Secretariat but rather be determined in concert
by all WHO member countries.</P>
      <P>Based on the WHA procedural rules, Chen said it is the WHO chief's duty and
responsibility that after he or she receives a membership application, 30 days
before a new round of the WHA, that the application be placed on the WHA agenda
for debate -- a job that should never be handled solely by the WHO Secretariat.</P>
      <P>It is beyond question that Taiwan is a sovereign state, Chen stated, adding that
Taiwan maintains formal diplomatic relations with 23 WHO member countries and
one WHO observer.</P>
      <P>On what basis could the WHO Secretariat have denied Taiwan's sovereign status by
saying that Taiwan is ineligible to apply for membership, and how on earth could
the WHO Secretariat cast doubt on the political decisions that 23 WHO member
countries have made concerning Taiwan, Chen questioned, ridiculing the decision.</P>
      <P>He lamented that Taiwan's bids to enter the WHA as an observer have all failed
over the past 10 years due to China's obstruction, thus the country's efforts to
"meaningfully participate" in WHO activities have also been frustrated as a
result of a memorandum of understanding struck secretly between China and the
WHO authorities in 2005.</P>
      <P>The president  stressed  that Taiwan will only incur more suppression and
humiliation if the country fails to work to defend its rights or continues to
restrict itself on the global arena and it is the reason why he has insisted
that Taiwan applies for a full membership in the WHO under the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan is not the only country in the world which is not a U.N. member
state but tries to gain accession into the WHO, adding that in 1968, the then
East Germany was not a U.N. member, but it became  a WHO full  member  that
year after  the then  WHO director-general asked to include East Germany's
application into the WHA agenda, with an attachment of the WHO Charter and the
WHA rules of procedure to serve as the reference of all other WHO member
countries.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that Taiwan is not challenging the WHO Charter or the WHA rules of
procedure, adding that Taiwan is just asking the WHO Secretariat and the WHO
chief to allow Taiwan's application to be included on the agenda of the next WHA
so that all WHO member countries could debate it and come to their own decision.</P>

      <P>The number of inbound visitors reached 881,292 in the first quarter of this
year, marking a 2.59 percent year-on-year increase, according to statistics
released by the Tourism Bureau Sunday.</P>
      <P>Japan remained the top source of visitors to Taiwan, while the number of
passengers from South Korea posted the largest growth, Tourism Bureau officials
said.</P>
      <P>Japanese people made 306,898 visits to Taiwan in the first three months of the
year, up 4.21 percent, according to the official tallies.</P>
      <P>In March alone, the number of visitors from Japan hit a new single-month high of
120,599, up 10.18 percent from the year-earlier level. Moreover, both business
travelers and leisure travelers registered solid gains during the month, the
officials said without providing exact figures.</P>
      <P>They attributed the upbeat records to a combination of factors, including the
practice of many Japanese companies to organize tours for their employees in
March -- the final month of the traditional Japanese fiscal year; a number of
festive activities, such as colorful lantern exhibitions, held throughout Taiwan
during the month; and an increase of flights offered between the two countries
in March.</P>
      <P>Another encouraging development during the first quarter of the year was a 16.58
percent year-on-year growth in the number of visitors from South Korea, the
officials said, adding that the annual growth rate even reached 27 percent in
March.</P>
      <P>South Koreans made 63,521 visits to Taiwan during the first quarter, according
to the Tourism Bureau tallies. In March alone, 9,528 South Koreans made
sightseeing trips to Taiwan, up 66 percent from a year ago. The steep increase
might be attributable to Lantern Festival and tourism promotional  activities
launched by noted Taiwanese pop group F4, the officials said.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the number of South Korean business travelers during the same month
decreased 5.75 percent to 6,129, the officials said.</P>
      <P>During  the first quarter,  the number  of visitors  from China-controlled areas
of Hong Kong and Macau also registered a rare decline of 5.48 percent to 95,451,
while the number of American visitors rose 2.21 percent to 92,648.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the number of visitors from Singapore surged 7.15 percent to 37,982
and the number of Malaysian visitors also increased 4.97 percent to 28,668.</P>
      <P>During the same period, the number of visitors from European countries posted a
6.48 percent growth to 45,706, while the number of visitors from Australia and
New Zealand jumped 10.34 percent to 13,740.</P>
      <P>According to a Tourism Bureau analysis, the number of tourists or leisure
travelers to Taiwan from its major tourist markets totaled 372,653 in the
January-March period, up 5.74 percent from the year-earlier level, but the
number of business travelers from its major trading partners slid 3.68 percent

    <TEXT>
      <P>A student labor rights advocacy group urged the government Sunday to set a
higher minimum hourly wage for part-time workers than what the Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA) has recommended.</P>
      <P>A spokeswoman for the activist group known as the Young Laborers 95 Alliance
said the minimum hourly wage should be raised to between NT$101 and NT$103 in
terms of the new CLA-proposed hourly wage calculating formula, not the CLA-
recommended NT$93 to NT$95.</P>
      <P>After a three-hour meeting on Friday, the CLA's wage reviewing committee came up
with a package of recommendations to adjust the country's minimum monthly and
hourly wages, both of which have been frozen for 10 years.</P>
      <P>According to the committee's recommendations, the minimum monthly wage should be
raised by 7.5 percent to 9.5 percent. That means the minimum monthly wage will
be adjusted upwards to between NT$17,028 and NT$17,345 from the current
NT$15,840.</P>
      <P>In response to calls from part-time workers, the committee also suggested that
the minimum payment for those paid by hour be raised to between NT$93 and NT$95
from the present NT$66.</P>
      <P>The recommended minimum hourly wage reflects a shortened work week that has been
in place for monthly wage earners for several years. The new calculating formula
also allows for a weekly off day for part-time workers. At present, the minimum
hourly wage is calculated on a 30-work-day-per-month and eight-work-hour-per-day
formula. The new calculating formula is based on a criteria of 182.66 work hours
per month.</P>
      <P>The 95 Alliance spokeswoman claimed that the minimum hourly wage calculated in
terms of the CLA recommended new formula should range between NT$101 and NT$103,
rather than between NT$93 and NT$95.</P>
      <P>If the rise in the consumer price index over the past decade is taken into
account, the spokeswoman said a more reasonable minimum hourly wage would be
NT$125.</P>
      <P>The most unbearable point in the CLA-proposed adjustment package lies in its
failure to allow hourly wage earners to ask for double pay when they work on
national holidays, the spokeswoman said.</P>
      <P>"The CLA has violated the Labor Standards Law in its ban on part-time workers or
hourly wage earners to claim double pay for working on national holidays since
the law has such a provision," she said, adding that the 95 Alliance will
organize a protest at the Executive Yuan Monday to push for a removal of such an
illegal ban.</P>

      <P>More than 2,000 people from some 400 families rallied on Taipei streets Sunday
to support "International Spank Out Day" which was initiated in 1998 by a U.S.
group to bring widespread attention to its campaign to end the physical
punishment of children.</P>
      <P>Activists from several dozen other Taiwan civil groups, including Homemakers'
Union and Foundation, also took part in the rally -- a walk from National Taiwan
University to Daan Forest Park -- sponsored by the non-profit Humanistic
Education Foundation (HEF).</P>
      <P>HEF volunteers called on Taiwan parents and teachers not to spank their children
or students, while offering educational information to parents and caregivers
about non-violent discipline alternatives.</P>
      <P>Group members suggested that adults, rather than smacking a child on a sudden
impulse, place a phone call for educational consultation, exchange pithy
formulas encouraging  non-violent  solutions  -- particularly during periods of
anger -- and seek supportive resources in order to help end the resort to
violence.</P>
      <P>"Angry" parents and teachers are also encouraged to hit drums, play ball, or
clean the house to channel their sudden impulses or dissipate bad moods.</P>
      <P>Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng, who was among several celebrities invited
by the HEF to offer their "pithy formulas" to beef up April 30 "International
Spank Out Day, " said: "Respect and understand children to avoid treating them
violently."</P>
      <P>Noting that even a little  child is a human being whose individuality should be
respected by adults, Tu said that spanking will actually deal only with

      <P>A qualifying round for the 2007 Mahjong World Championship began in Taipei
Sunday, with 150 contestants taking part in three days of competition.</P>
      <P>The competition in Taipei is part of a series of regional qualifying tournaments
in Asia, Europe and North America.</P>
      <P>The eight top winners in the Taipei event will qualify to move on to the semi-
finals, to be held in June in either Denmark or Japan. A total of 20 finalists
will earn the right to join the grand finale, the Mahjong World Championship, in
November in the city of Chengdu in China's Sichuan province.</P>
      <P>GigaMedia Global Limited, a provider of online entertainment software and
services, has secured a five-year exclusive right to co-host the Mahjong World
Championship in conjunction with the World Mahjong Organization -- the official
international body that sets the rules of the game and competition standards.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for GigaMedia said the company plans to hold a Mahjong World
Championship in Taipei within the next five years.</P>
      <P>Mahjong is said to have originated in China about 2,500 years ago, but the four-
person game assumed its current form in the 19th century.</P>
      <P>Organizers of the Mahjong World Championship have indicated that they plan to
turn the competition into an event "as big as the World Series of Poker," with
television programming, corporate sponsorships and awards totaling millions of
dollars.</P>
      <P>They said that playing the game for fun should also be accepted, instead of
merely focusing on it as a form of gambling.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPAQUE PROCESS FOR BUYOUT HURTS TAIWAN: U.S. BUSINESS GROUP</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A U.S. business group claimed Sunday that Taiwan's lengthy delays and lack of
formal process for leveraged buyout deals hurts Taiwan chip companies.</P>
      <P>In a press release posted on its Website Sunday, the U.S.-Taiwan Business
Council, which is dedicated to fostering trade and business relations between
the United States and Taiwan, said Taiwan's government should set up a thorough,
transparent, and straightforward process for mergers and acquisitions in
Taiwan's semiconductor industry.</P>
      <P>The lack of a permanent and timely process for reviewing mergers and acquisition
activity in the chip sector adds costs that may inhibit foreign investment from
even exploring Taiwan's market, according to the press release.</P>
      <P>In addition, the council said, it leads to delays that may ultimately cause
deals to collapse -- a contributing factor in the recently scuppered plan by
U.S.-based Carlyle Group to buy out Kaohsiung, Taiwan-based chip packager
Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASE).</P>
      <P>Carlyle offered to buy ASE for NT$39 per share in November, 2006, but called off
the bid early this month over the failure to clench a deal with the ASE.</P>
      <P>Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council said that
increased merger and acquisition activity in the semiconductor industry would
have a positive impact on the overall value of Taiwan's economy as well as
increasing the capital available to companies.</P>
      <P>Noting that the semiconductor sector is a jewel in Taiwan's economic crown,
Hammond-Chambers warned that legacy policies on chip investment in China, and
the lack of formal processes for merger and acquisition activities in the sector
are set to undermine the efforts of Taiwanese companies to become industry
leaders through partnerships with global capital.</P>

acknowledge diplomas issued by Chinese schools before mainland Chinese students

    <TEXT>New York Times: Rebuilt Iraq Projects Found Crumbling

In a troubling sign for the American-financed rebuilding program in Iraq,
inspectors for a federal oversight agency have found that in a sampling of eight
projects that the United States had declared successes, seven were no longer
operating as designed because of plumbing and electrical failures, lack of
proper maintenance, apparent looting and expensive equipment that lay idle.

The United States has previously admitted, sometimes under pressure from federal
inspectors, that some of its reconstruction projects have been abandoned,
delayed or poorly constructed. But this is the first time inspectors have found
that projects officially declared a success X in some cases, as little as six
months before the latest inspections X were no longer working properly.</TEXT>

      <P>The government will conduct careful planning before allowing Chinese citizens to
study in Taiwan, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) officials said Sunday.</P>
      <P>In particular, the government needs to break through the current legal
restrictions and work out a management plan to regulate the students' stay in
Taiwan, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials were responding to a proposal, put forth during a Beijing forum
between the Communist Party of China and Taiwan's Kuomintang, that Taiwan
colleges and universities recruit students in China to promote cross-Taiwan
Strait educational exchanges and cooperation.</P>
      <P>According to the MAC, although allowing China students to study in Taiwan will
help some Taiwan universities increase their student numbers and enhance
understanding of Taiwan by China's younger generation, the policy involves a
number of issues, such as requiring the students to find a guarantor, providing
them with guidance on life in Taiwan, permitting them to accept part-time jobs
and including them in insurance programs.</P>
      <P>There will also be other issues that will arise after the students' graduation,
including their residence, employment, marriage and over-staying of their visas,
as well as these issues' impact on national security, MAC officials said.</P>
      <P>Noting that most Taiwan universities still rely on government funding and do not
set different tuition rates for domestic and foreign students, the officials
said that allowing Chinese students to study in Taiwan under these circumstances
will not help increase the universities' financial resources but will dilute
Taiwan's higher education resources.</P>
      <P>While the government has always supported exchange activities that are helpful
to promoting positive cross-strait interaction and expects cross-strait
exchanges in all areas, it will not help if China only targets some selected
activities, they said.</P>
      <P>The officials pointed out that there are a lot of problems in cross-strait
exchanges that remain unresolved and urged China to resume talks with Taiwan as
soon as possible to resolve the problems.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged the European Parliament Monday to continue to
support Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Organization (WHO) , a goal which
is being pursued this year under the name of "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Addressing the issue while receiving members of a pro-Taiwan group in the
European Parliament, Chen stressed that Taiwan is applying to join the WHO under
the name of "Taiwan" not because the country is changing its official title but
because the name is more familiar to the international community than its
official title "Republic of China."</P>
      <P>On the WHO Secretariat's claim that Taiwan is not a sovereign country and
therefore not qualified to become a WHO member, the president asserted that
Taiwan's status as a sovereign country is "unquestionable" because Taiwan
maintains diplomatic relations with 23 official members of the WHO and one
observer in the organization.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that Taiwan has tried but failed to join the WHO for the past
10 years and that even the country's bid for "meaningful participation" in the
organization has been unsuccessful.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that the 23 million Taiwan people's right to health should not be
ignored, denied or restricted, while expressing his gratitude to the European
Parliament for adopting resolutions in support of Taiwan's WHO bid on many

      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) will deal squarely with personnel who are
found to be responsible for the leakage of information about the 23rd Han Kuang
military exercise to be held in May, an MND official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the legislative Defense Committee, Deputy Defense Minister
Ko Chen-heng admitted that part of an Apple Daily report Monday saying that
details of the 23rd Han Kuang drill can be viewed at the FOXY Web site was
correct, including the time and item names of the drill, but part of the report,
including the names of forces to take part in the exercise, was wrong.</P>
      <P>Ko said that investigations into the leakage of the information have begun and
that the personnel responsible will be severely punished.</P>
      <P>This marked the fourth time this year that information about the 23rd Han Kuang
exercise has allegedly been leaked.</P>
      <P>The exercise will be based on a simulated scenario regarding the cross-Taiwan
Strait military situation in the year 2010, according to Chiu Kuo-cheng, an MND
deputy chief of the general staff for operations and planning.</P>
      <P>In the scenario, Taiwan has to defend itself against a Chinese invasion attempt
launched due to Taiwan's refusal to participate in unification  talks,  Chiu
said,  adding that Taiwan's military capability in the scenario is the same as
at present due to a lack of progress in terms of arms procurement. He further
said that this year's Han Kuang drill has two phases: full-scale maneuvers and
computer war game simulations.</P>
      <P>According to Chiu, the full-scale maneuvers will be carried out in areas of
Penghu, Hualien, Yilan, Hsinchu, Taichung, Changhua and Pingtung as scheduled by
the MND, with some of the maneuvers open to the public to watch at certain
times. The computer war game simulations will proceed for five consecutive days
at all command centers, he added.</P>

      <P>Nearly 74 percent of Taiwan workers worry that they might become victims of
karoshi -- a Japanese term for death from overwork and stress and fatigue from
long working hours -- according to the results of a public opinion poll released
Monday.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by 1111 Job Bank April 13-27 to mark May 1 Labor Day, found
that 90 percent of the respondents have worked overtime, with overtime hours
averaging 8.2 hours per week or 1.64 hours per work day.</P>
      <P>Of this group, nearly 50 percent were not paid for their overtime, the poll
found.</P>
      <P>Wu Jui-ying, a 1111 vice president, quoted a 2003 report compiled by the
Lausanne,  Switzerland-based  International Institute of Management Development
as indicating that the Taiwanese worked an average of 2,282 hours a year in
2002, more than anyone else in the world.</P>
      <P>Wu said that according to similar tallies compiled by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics, Taiwan workers worked an average of 2,170
hours a year in 2006, or 180.8 hours per month.</P>
      <P>The 1111 poll found that Taiwan's salaried men and women worked 8.18 more hours
per week than the normal weekly work hours so far this year, marking an increase
of 1.52 hours over the average of 6.66 hours recorded in 2004 in terms of weekly
overtime hours.</P>
      <P>In terms of overtime hours, the poll found that 71.7 percent of the responding
office workers work overtime in the evening after their normal work, 19.38
percent work overtime when the need arises and 17.6 percent work at the weekend.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that 73.79 percent of the office workers worry that they
might die from overwork, as they often suffer from symptoms of fatigue,
including sore, numb neck and shoulders, declining memory, difficulty
concentrating and mood swings.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted online, had a confidence level of 95 percent and a margin of
error of 2.2 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PEOPLE OVER 50 URGED TO CHECK FOR COLON CANCER EVERY YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  30 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Bureau of Health Promotion urged people over 50 years of age Monday to
receive yearly screening for colon cancer, which is the third-most common kind
of cancer among people in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kung Hsien-lan,  head of the bureau's  Cancer Control and Prevention Division,
noted that colon cancer is the result of colorectal polyps turning malignant and
that there is a 46 percent chance of malignant cells existing in polyps larger
than two centimeters in diameter.</P>
      <P>While 90 percent of colon cancer patients can survive if the cancer is
discovered at stage I, the survival rate is less than 20 percent if it is
discovered only at the terminal stage, Kung pointed out.</P>
      <P>According to Kung, colon cancer is most prevalent in people over 50 years of
age, and experiences of Europe and the United States show that receiving fecal
occult blood tests every one to two years can help early discovery of colon
cancer and reduce the death rate by 18 percent to 33 percent.</P>
      <P>Advising people over 50 to receive screening every year, Kung said the
government now subsidizes fecal occult blood tests for citizens 50-69 years of
age every two years.</P>
      <P>Tallies from the Department of Health indicate that colon cancer has the third-
highest cancer-related death rate in Taiwan. While 3,898 of 7,366 people
diagnosed with colon cancer in 2002 died within two years, 4,111 of 8,238 people
diagnosed in 2003 died within two years, according to the tallies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is a sovereign state and "formally became independent" the day Taiwan
people cast their votes to elect their president for the first time March 23,
1996, Vice President Annette Lu claimed Monday in the eastern city of Hualien,
adding that March 23 should therefore be set as Taiwan's independence day.</P>
      <P>In a speech to her supporters in the Hualien area, Lu said Hualien could be a
"defensive frontline zone " instead of a safe place in the rear in the event of
military attacks by China.</P>
      <P>She lambasted Beijing for downgrading Taiwan's sovereign status when announcing
a 2008 Olympic torch relay route plan recently that included  Taiwan  as a
"domestic  leg." She also blamed  the administrative department for failing to
take preventive or remedial measures beforehand in this regard.</P>
      <P>Noting that only people in sovereign states are given the right to elect their
own presidents, Lu claimed that presidential elections have made Taiwan not only
a de facto independent country, "but also a de jure independent one."</P>
      <P>Knowing this fact well, she went on, China fired intimidating missiles into the
seas off the coasts of Keelung and Kaohsiung on the eve of the March 23
presidential election in 1996.</P>
      <P>She added that one of the missions that the new Taiwan president to be elected
in 2008 should strive to carry out is to normalize Taiwan's sovereign status in
the international community, claiming that so far none of the other presidential
aspirants is as capable and devoted as she is in this regard.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The textbooks used by the country's high schools present laborers in a bad
light, a teachers' group complained Monday.</P>
      <P>In a press conference called to mark May 1 Labor Day, Wu Chung-tai, president of
the National Teachers' Association, said the current textbooks, published by
various companies with the approval of the Ministry of Education, either fail to
prepare students for the labor markets they will face after graduation or
portray laborers and labor unions in an unflattering light.</P>
      <P>He claimed that all the current textbooks, regardless of their publishers, are
skewed in favor of capitalists, although a majority of the students who have to
use the textbooks are likely to end up as laborers living on salaries.</P>
      <P>It is a shame that these textbooks, instead of priming students with information
about laborers' rights, ways to solve labor disputes and the negative impact
brought about by globalization, offer an unrealistically  rosy  picture  of
economic  development  and globalization, Wu went on.</P>
      <P>Citing examples, labor activist Chen Chu-po said at the news conference that a
history textbook published by the Taiyu Company for vocational senior high
schools "unfairly" lays the blame for the exodus of local firms in the 1980s on
environmentalists and high labor costs.</P>
      <P>It is an insult to the country's laborers that textbooks discriminating against
them have been approved by the Ministry of Education, Chen said.</P>
      <P>They urged the education authorities to invite labor activists to sit on its
panel responsible for working out guidelines for compiling textbooks and revise
the guidelines to embody respect for labor rights and instil students with the
ideas of socialism.</P>

      <P>The education resources enjoyed by Taiwan students would be diluted if the
government were to allow China citizens to study in Taiwan without working out
proper complementary measures, a Ministry of Education official claimed Monday.</P>
      <P>According to Szu Chi-pu, executive secretary of the ministry's Mainland Affairs
Task Force, there are more than 150 colleges and universities in Taiwan, with
public institutions receiving 80 percent of their funding from the government
and private institutions receiving 18 percent to 20 percent of their funding
from the government.</P>
      <P>In assessing whether to allow Chinese students to study here, the government
needs also to take into account the possible decline in the quality of education
and the policy's possible impact on the country's public order, Szu said.</P>
      <P>Citing the example of Japan, Szu said approximately 70,000 China students have
studied in Japan since Japanese universities started recruiting Chinese
citizens, but he claimed that the policy has resulted in worsening of Japan's
public order.</P>
      <P>In one case, a Chinese student killed a family of five in Kyushu around four
years ago, which prompted the Japanese government to sponsor a racist
advertisement urging its citizens to "beware of Chinese, " Szu said, adding that
the advertisement was removed after protests by the Chinese government.</P>
      <P>Szu made the remarks in response to Beijing's announcement Sunday that Taiwan
colleges and universities are welcome to recruit students in China to promote
cross-Taiwan Strait educational exchanges and cooperation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Because  of discontent  with the Kuomintang's (KMT) delay in furthering
coordination on the coming legislative polls, People First Party (PFP) lawmakers
will attend Tuesday's Procedure Committee meeting but might not vote on a bill
aimed at ex-KMT Chief Ma Ying-jeou, a PFP lawmaker said Monday.</P>
      <P>The decision was made during a PFP legislative caucus meeting earlier in the
day,  in a gesture to express PFP lawmakers' dissatisfaction with the KMT's
postponement of two-way talks to better coordinate candidacies in December's
legislative elections.</P>
      <P>The Procedure Committee is slated to address the bill designed to squeeze Ma out
of the 2008 presidential election for the third time Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The KMT fails to control a majority in the Legislative Yuan and needs PFP
collaboration to kill the bill, which carries tremendous significance for the
party's future as the presidential election approaches.</P>
      <P>According to PFP legislative caucus whip Fu Kun-chi,  PFP lawmakers will attend
Tuesday's meeting after several of them expressed displeasure with the KMT's
attitude, but they will refrain from voting on the Ma bill.</P>
      <P>Since PFP lawmakers joined forces with their KMT peers during the April 17
Procedure Committee in blocking "the Ma exclusion bill" put forward by the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) after the two parties reached an
initial seven-point  agreement  on the legislative elections, the KMT has not
held new talks with the PFP to advance cooperation, despite pledging that it
would do so within two weeks.</P>
      <P>PFP lawmakers will certainly take part in the coming Procedure Committee
meeting, but how they will act depends on how the meeting progresses, PFP
lawmaker Feng Ting-kuo said.</P>
      <P>"There will be room for negotiations if the KMT honors its promise to allot
seven constituencies to the PFP in the seven-point agreement," Feng said.</P>
      <P>Ma  is viewed as the opposition's  best bet for the 2008 presidential race, but
the former KMT chairman has been indicted on corruption charges by Taipei
prosecutors in a case related to allegations that he embezzled over NT$11
million from a special monthly municipal allowance earmarked for his
discretionary use when he served as mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006.</P>
      <P>Ma stepped down from the KMT's top post in mid-February and announced his desire
to run for president immediately after being indicted.</P>

      <P>A senior Chinese official said Monday that he would like to see the 2008 Cross-
Strait Economic, Trade and Cultural Forum between the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) and the Communist Party of China (CPC) held in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of China's State Council,
expressed the wish while he was seeing off Lien Chan, honorary KMT chairman, at
the airport after the KMT and the CPC held their third cross-strait forum in
Beijing April 28-29.</P>
      <P>Chen said that each time the two sides prepare to hold the annual forum, there
are people in Taiwan who heap negative or abusive remarks on the meeting.</P>
      <P>"Yet we have been going from strength to strength, and I would hope that the
next forum can be held in Taiwan," he said.</P>
      <P>Lien, who led a delegation consisting of more than 100 senior KMT officials and
Taiwan business leaders, told reporters at the airport that the people of Taiwan
"will welcome the achievements of the 2007 forum."</P>
      <P>He urged the government in Taipei to "reap the forum's fruitful results" for the
sake of the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Some 500 participants attended the two-day forum and discussed various issues,
including cooperation in education, sightseeing trips by Chinese tourists to
Taiwan and direct flights across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Among the new measures announced by Beijing during the forum was a decision to
allow students from China to apply to study in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lien met with Chinse President Hu Jintao at the opening of the forum. It was the
third time they had met since the KMT and the CPC held their first forum in
Beijing in April 2005 -- the first top-level talks between the two political
parties in 60 years.</P>

remove barriers to its policy to help bail out ongoing negotiations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen issued the call at a seminar in Kaohsiung City attended by representatives
of the local tourism, business and industry sectors.</P>
      <P>Chen's comments came after the third economic cooperation forum held between
Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the Communist Party of China (CPC)
concluded a day earlier in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Although the KMT and the CPC reached agreement in several fields, including
allowing Taiwan-based universities  and businesses to recruit students in China
and to invest in Chinese shipping and container companies, Chen, Taiwan's top
China policy planner, pointed out that the conclusions are invalid because the
KMT does not represent the Taiwan government.</P>
      <P>"What the KMT and the CPC have done is more burdensome than beneficial, further
complicating the situation, " the MAC chief said, adding that "any agreement
reached between them must be approved by the government."</P>
      <P>Chen called on Beijing to remove barriers to its existing policy toward Taiwan
so as to help push forward real negotiations already underway between the two
sides.</P>
      <P>Pointing to the long-expected opening of Taiwan to Chinese tourists as an
example, Chen said that the "simple" issue remains unsolved following Sunday's
KMT-CPC forum and ascribed the failure to Beijing's continuous attempts to
rehash political issues. "But bilateral negotiations on the issue must go on,"
he said.</P>
      <P>As to the issue concerning Beijing's plan to relay the 2008 Olympic Games torch
through Taiwan as part of its domestic route, Chen said that the government will
never yield to China's "two-faced" scheme to make Taiwan one of its provinces
and thus will not accept the Beijing-proposed relay route.</P>
      <P>The main obstacle to Taiwan-China dealings and permanent peace in the Taiwan
Strait resides in Beijing's reluctance to recognize this country's existence as
an independent sovereignty, he said.</P>
      <P>In the face of Beijing's increasing bullying of Taiwan, he also called for
concerted efforts from the opposition parties and local governments to forge
national consensus and common ground toward China.</P>

      <P>Construction work on the main stadium for the 2009 World Games in Kaohsiung is
ahead of schedule, an executive of Fu Tsu Construction Co., which won the bid to
build the stadium, said Monday.</P>
      <P>Laio Nien-chi, vice chairman of Fu Tsu, told Kaohsiung Deputy Mayor Cheng Wen-
lung  during  the later's  inspection  of the construction site that the project
is now 16.17 percent complete, slightly ahead of the scheduled progress of 16.08
percent.</P>
      <P>The stadium, covering an area of 19 hectares, will cost N$5 billion (US$150.6
million). It will have world-class track and field facilities, and a seating
capacity to accommodate 55,000 people.</P>
      <P>The stadium  has been designed  to be the world's  first multifunction stadium
powered by solar energy. Its solar power generators will be capable of supplying
1 million kilowatts of electricity a year.</P>
      <P>The generators can meet the stadium's power needs for lighting and air
conditioning during the World Games. When no sports events are taking place, the
surplus electricity can be sold to Taiwan Power Co. and net NT$5 million per
year in revenue for the Kaohsiung city government,  according  to officials
from the Kaohsiung  city government's Public Works Bureau.</P>
      <P>The project is scheduled for completion by January 2009, allowing enough time to
prepare for the World Games, to be held July 16-26, 2009.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chairman of the Taiwan Friendship Group in the European Parliament, Georg
Jarzembowski, suggested Monday that Taiwan's government better communicate to
the international community its reasons to reject the Beijing-proposed Olympic
torch relay route.</P>
      <P>Noting that he was not in an appropriate position to comment on whether or not
letting the torch in would be more advantageous for Taiwan, Jarzembowski said it
is clear that Taiwanshould avoid any situation as to present the image to a
third country that Taipei is of the same status as Hong Kong and Macau.</P>
      <P>Jarzembowski made the remarks while talking with a number of reporters at the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He and other three European Parliament members,
also from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and
European Democrats, are on a six-day visit in Taiwan and met with President Chen
Shui-bian earlier the day.</P>
      <P>Jarzembowski said he does not consider the government's decision to reject the
torch route to be election-driven as some elements in Taiwan claim. Rather, he
said he believes that Chen made the decision in order to defend the status quo
and Taiwan's status as a sovereign state.</P>
      <P>China announced next year's Olympic torch relay route Thursday, in which Taipei
is defined by Beijing as the first stop on Chinese soil, after Vietnam's Ho Chi
Minh City and before China's Hong Kong. Taiwan quickly rejected the plan,
insisting the torch should enter and exit Taiwan via third countries.</P>
      <P>Over the issue of Taiwan applying for full membership to the World Health
Organization (WHO) , Jarzembowski said although no positive answers can be
expected in near future, the issue of Taiwan's participation in the WHO should
be kept on the table.</P>
      <P>Jarzembowski said it is always important for Taiwan toraise the flagshowing that
Taiwan is a sovereign state and has the right to contribute its expertise in
health regulations. As for what the best strategy to achieve those goals will
be, he said it is a decision best left to the country's government.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that at the moment the European Parliament, the United States and
Japan support the idea of Taiwan becoming a World Health Assembly observer, and
the European Commission is in favor of the arrangement  allowing for Taiwan to
engage in "meaningful participation."</P>
      <P>He said he hopes Margaret Chan, the new WHO Director-General from Hong  Kong,
will not hinder  Taiwan's  cooperation  with the organization.</P>
      <P>Jarzembowski said there needs to be official dialogue between the government of
People's Republic of China and the government of Republic of China if cross-
strait tensions are to be eased.</P>
      <P>Europe is closely watching human rights situation in China, Jarzembowski said,
China has to know that it is not a question of 'Western stylehuman rights
requirement, but a question of China's own destiny, because in the long run it
can not have economic prosperity while depriving people of their liberty.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC URGES BEIJING TO ACT IN CROSS-STRAIT NEGOTIATION MECHANISM</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) suggested Monday that China act
within existing cross-Taiwan Strait engagement mechanisms while proposing to
open more access points for cross-straits chartered flight services.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Liu Te-hsun made the remarks in response to media inquiries on
several controversial announcements by Chinese authorities at a two-day forum
co-hosted by Taiwan's largest opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the Community
Party of China (CPC) in Beijing that ended Sunday.</P>
      <P>The announcements include the opening of six more Chinese cities, namely
Chengdu, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Shenzhen, Kueilin, and Dalian, to serve as cross-
strait chartered flight destinations, and the opening of Taiwanese colleges and
universities to enroll students from China.</P>
      <P>Liu explained  that the two sides talked about the issue concerning
destinations  of the chartered cargo and passenger cross-strait flight services
during authorized negotiations, and that the KMT-CPC forum only served to
exchange opinions between two political parties and any agreements arising from
such an event cannot be implemented without governmental authorization.</P>
      <P>As to the issue of Chinese student enrollment, Liu stressed that educational
resources in the country are shared by all Taiwanese people. Providing local
students with the best educational resources on the one hand, while on the other
hand resolving the difficulties of some local colleges and universities in
recruiting students is a challenge the Ministry of Education has to face, he
said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on recent media reports saying that Beijing has defined Chinese
people's sightseeing visits to Taiwan not as "travel between two countries, "
the MAC official stated that the government hopes that Beijing will deal with
the issue concerning Chinese tourists' visits to Taiwan in a pragmatic manner,
meaning on an economic basis, not a political one.</P>
      <P>Any unnecessary political barriers will certainly cause difficulties in the
cross-strait dialogues on the issue, Liu noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSU LAWMAKERS SPEAK OUT FOR TERTIARY-EDUCATION GRADUATES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 39 (CNA)
04/30/07  22:00:37

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of lawmakers of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) Monday
urged the government not to allow further enrollments at tertiary education
institutes, citing the huge supply-demand gap between college graduates and the
domestic job market.</P>
      <P>The group of TSU lawmakers, led by legislative caucus whip Tseng Tsahn-deng,
issued the call in a Legislative Yuan news conference on the eve of the May 1
Labor Day.</P>
      <P>Calling on the government to pay greater heed to a high unemployment rate of
4.36 percent among Taiwan's university graduates and master's and doctoral
degree holders, Tseng said that aglut of "unqualified" higher education manpower
is already having an impact on starting salaries.</P>
      <P>Citing the latest statistics compiled by the Cabinet-level Council of Labor
Affairs, Tseng reported that the starting monthly salaries for tertiary degree
holders new to the job market averaged NT$31,500, while those for new university
and college graduates stood at NT$26,700 and NT$23,800, respectively.</P>
      <P>The earnings of Taiwan's university graduates and higher-degree holders are
little compared by their tuition fees, which have markedly risen in recent
years, Tseng said, noting that salaries for Taiwan's higher education diploma
holders have bogged down over the latest 10 years.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Tseng pointed out, a local graduate from a private college or
university typically carries student loan debts of at least NT$400,000.</P>
      <P>The TSU lawmakers' call came after Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
concluded an economic cooperation forum with the Communist Party of China (CPC),
the third of its kind, a day earlier in Beijing.</P>
      <P>The CPC offered several overtures to Taiwan, including allowing Taiwan-based
universities and colleges to recruit students in China, among others.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the issue, TSU Chairman Huang Kun-huei voiced his opposition on
the grounds that Taiwan's higher education resources have been insufficient due
to rapid expansion, with each college student receiving only NT$10,000 in
government subsidies per year, a drop from the previous level of NT$30,000.</P>
      <P>Against such a backdrop, there is no reason for Taiwan's colleges and
universities to court Chinese students -- a situation which Huang predicted
would further stretch educational resources for local students.</P>
      <P>What the government should do, Huang opined, is adopt adequate measures  to
phase  out  poorly-performing  higher  education institutions.</P>
      <P>According to TSU Secretary-General Chien Chen-shan, Taiwan cannot pin its hopes
on China to address such a problem. Many more complications involving employment
and immigration will arise from such an opening to Chinese students and a
recognition of Chinese academic degrees, he warned.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Filler in Animal Feed Is Open Secret in China

As American food safety regulators head to China to investigate how a chemical
made from coal found its way into pet food that killed dogs and cats in the
United States, workers in this heavily polluted northern city openly admit that
the substance is routinely added to animal feed as a fake protein.

For years, producers of animal feed all over China have secretly supplemented
their feed with the substance, called melamine, a cheap additive that looks like
protein in tests, even though it does not provide any nutritional benefits,
according to melamine scrap traders and agricultural workers here.

Wall Street Journal:65,000 Airplanes Tracked Globally

Nearly 30,000 commercial airliners fly around the world, and Alexandre Avrane
tracks each of them.

Through a telescope in his penthouse apartment, Mr. Avrane can spot planes miles
beyond Paris. But his real intelligence lies in a global network of airplane
fanatics from Tehran to Lima to Shanghai. The Frenchman even has a pair of eyes
in Goma, near war-torn Congo's border with Rwanda.

Maximo J. Gainza, a fellow enthusiast from Buenos Aires, in February emailed Mr.
Avrane an interesting nugget: A Boeing 727 that had been in the fleet of
Bolivian flag carrier Lloyd Aereo Boliviano for 37 years was still flying, Mr.
Gainza wrote, setting a record for the longest time served by a plane with a
single airline.</TEXT>

      <P>Nearly half of Taiwanese youngsters practice impulsebuying, although over 70
percent of them agree that it is worthwhile to think it over before making a
decision, according to results of a survey released Monday.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by ACNeilson Taiwan Limited at the request of Citibank
Taiwan and Taiwan Women's Rescue Foundation, obtained satisfactory answers from
1,742 high school students throughout Taiwan between Sept. 18, 2006 and Jan. 19,
2007.</P>
      <P>The results show that 45 percent  of youngsters  surveyed acknowledged that they
would buy on the spur of the moment. Of the girls surveyed, 53 percent said they
would purchase what they like this way, compared to 34 percent of the boys who
would do the same.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 84 percent of the young people believe that they should be
held responsible for their own behavior, and 90 percent said they understand
that a person's bad credit history will make it difficult to get bank loans in
the future.</P>
      <P>The study also found that an on-campus educational program on personal financing
could increase the number of students with good knowledge of personal finance
from 21 percent to 41 percent.</P>

      <P>Scores of foreign experts on electronic passports have been invited to attend a
seminar to be sponsored Tuesday by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) to
offer tips on Taiwan's e-passport issuance plan, a diplomatic official said
Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the MOFA is organizing the Taiwan ePassport Forum in
cooperation with the Asia Pacific Smart Card Association in preparation for its
planned issuance of e-passports from next year.</P>
      <P>Electronic passport specialists from Germany, France, Australia, the Netherlands
and several other countries will deliver keynote speeches at the forum, the
official said, adding that foreign participants will also exchange views and
technological know-how with relevant local software and hardware manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Noting that the MOFA's Bureau of Consular  Affairs  began preparations for the
e-passport issuance in 2005, the official said the ministry hopes to obtain
expert views and counseling on Taiwan's e-passport program through the forum.</P>
      <P>In addition to MOFA staff members, the official said senior officials from
10-plus relevant government agencies have also been invited to attend the
seminar to keep them abreast of the latest development and technological know-
how in related fields.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the issuance of an e-passport is an integral part of passport
renewal to stamp out forgery and other related frauds, the official said
e-passport issuance will not affect existing passport application procedures and
will follow the principles of convenience and accessibility.</P>
      <P>The official  further said the data to be stored in the e-passport's integrated
circuit or memory chip will be same as those recorded in the present version of
passport.</P>
      <P>"The chip embedded in the back cover of the passport will not carry such
controversial items as fingerprints and iris scans, " the official said, adding
that special devices will also be introduced to prevent stealing or hacking of
information stored in the chip.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the official said the MOFA has referred a package of amendments to
the passport statute to the Legislative Yuan for approval to provide a legal
basis to the issuance of e-passports.</P>
      <P>Thanks to active promotion by the United States and formulation of relevant
standards and regulations by the international civil aviation  organizations,
37  advanced  countries  have  issued e-passports.</P>
      <P>As sophisticated technologies have been introduced to protect the personal
information of e-passport holders, the official said the issuance of e-passport
will help prevent passport falsification and even help speed up immigration
procedures.</P>
