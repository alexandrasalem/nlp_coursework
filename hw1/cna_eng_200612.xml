    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S FUTURE BELONGS TO ITS PEOPLE: FILMMAKER(REPEAT)</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's future belongs to its people, and
the people of Taiwan have the right to find "their real selves, "
Taiwanese-American filmmaker Will Tiao said in an interview with 
CNA Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese have the right to find themselves... because they have
never had the chance to develop and articulate their own selves, "
Tiao said on the last day of a two-week promotion tour of a film
titled Formosa Betrayed.</P>
      <P>The movie, which Tiao plans to shoot next year and release in
2008, is about the story of the 1982 murder of a Taiwanese professor
who was killed for speaking out for an independent and democratic
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Many people in Taiwan have shown enormous support for a movie
they think is long overdue, said Tiao, who was born in Kansas and
comes from a family with strong pro-Taiwanese independence views.</P>
      <P>While stressing his position as a foreigner and trying to stay
away from political analysis during his visit, Tiao said he still
believes Taiwan's future should belong to its people and that Taiwan
is "a democracy that is coming into its own."</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is slowly starting to realize that it does have to deal
with the past if it wants to move toward becoming a normal country, "
he said, adding that people of this generation are probably not as
aware of history as they should be.</P>
      <P>For a long time, Taiwanese have been told by others about who
they are -- first the Japanese and then the Chinese. But Taiwanese
have the right to define themselves and explore what Taiwan identity
is, Tiao said.</P>
      <P>People of Taiwan have to know and reconcile the past before
moving forward. Only by doing so can they learn to deconstruct those
arguments of "conventional wisdom" and look at the world in a new
perspective, according to Tiao, who spent 10 years in Washington
working for the Formosan Association for Public Affairs, a
pro-independence lobby group.</P>

      <P>Taiwan aims to win 15 gold medals at
the 15th Asian Games which opened in Doha, Qatar Friday, according to
a sports official accompanied Taiwan's national team to the games.</P>
      <P>A total of 391 athletes are representing Chinese Taipei in 34
different sports at the games, which will run through Dec. 15.</P>
      <P>More than 13,000 athletes from 45 countries are expected to
compete in the 39 sports and 423 events at the Asian Games -- all
figures which represent record highs for the games.</P>
      <P>Among the 39 sports, chess and the triathlon have been included
for the first time at the games.</P>
      <P>This is also the first time that the Asian Games are being held
in West Asia. The host Qatar government has reportedly spent some
US$1 billion for the high-profile sports event -- building gyms,
sports arenas and facilities in the country, half of whose territory
is located in the desert.</P>
      <P>By sponsoring the 15th Asian Games, the Qatar government has
vowed to transform Qatar into the "mecca of sports" in the Middle
East to boost athletic and sports development in that part of the
world.</P>
      <P>Chinese Taipei is confident that it can win gold medals in about
10 sports, namely taekwondo, archery, shooting, karate, tennis, soft
tennis, table tennis, rhythmic gymnastics, bowling and golf. It is
also hoping to pick up gold in the equestrian event.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THREE GOALS SET FOR DEVELOPING PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY: VICE PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has envisioned three major
goals for the development of the country's pharmaceutical industry
over the next 10 years, including turning the island into a
biomedicine research, development and manufacturing stronghold, Vice
Premier Tsai Ing-wen said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The other two goals are making Taiwan into a medical and
pharmaceutical research and development center on major diseases in
Asia, as well as a gene pharmacology research and development center
in Asia, the vice premier said.</P>
      <P>She made the remarks while attending the annual conference of the
International Research-based Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association
in Taipei.</P>
      <P>To achieve the goals, the government should step up multinational
cooperation in the bio-tech industry, assist local manufacturers,
learn from the systems used in the industrialized nations to carry
out a comprehensive review on statutes regarding the promotion of the
industry as well as company law and regulations governing the listing
of companies so as to attract investment by local and foreign
manufacturing companies by creating a sound investment environment.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the government has listed the bio-tech sector as one of
the priority industries and has included it in the list of emerging
strategic industries that are provided with government incentives.</P>
      <P>She said that the government has invested around NT$55 billion
(US$1.66 billion) in the bio-tech industry over the past four years,
adding that the bio-tech industry currently generates NT$160 billion
in revenue. She estimated total revenues will hit NT$320 billion in
2010.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GROWTH IN NUMBER OF HIV-POSITIVE INMATES SLOWING DOWN: MOJ</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The rise in the number of HIV-positive
inmates or detainees has slowed down since the first quarter of this
year thanks to the Center for Disease Control's (CDC's) active AIDS
prevention and awareness campaign, a Ministry of Justice (MOJ)
official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Quoting MOJ tallies, Cheng An-hsiung, director of the ministry's
Department of Corrections, said the number of HIV-positive inmates
and detainees stood at 1,700 at the end of last year, marking a
four-fold increase from 419 recorded in 2004.</P>
      <P>As of the end of September this year, the number of HIV-positive
inmates/detainees rose to 2,600, with those serving prison terms
accounting for 92 percent of the total. The monthly figures so far
this year show that the growth in the number of HIV-positive inmates
has been slackening, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>To mark the anniversary of a "Clean Syringe Exchange Program" to
prevent the spread of HIV infection among drug addicts, the CDC
issued a press release at the end of October, saying that the
percentage of new HIV infections had declined from 14.4 out of every
100,000 people a year ago to 13 for the first nine months of this
year.</P>
      <P>According to the CDC statistics, a total of 2,316 new
HIV-carriers were recorded in the January-September period, down from
3,400 recorded for the same period last year. The CDC forecast this
year's total number of new HIV carriers at 3,100.</P>
      <P>"All these figures point to encouraging signs of a slowdown in
expansion of HIV infection," Cheng said.</P>
      <P>In addition to the "Clean Syringe Exchange Program" launched by
the CDC to provide clean syringes for drug addicts, Chen said, the
slowdown in HIV infection can also be attributed to the CDC's
intensified HIV/AIDS awareness campaign over the past year.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, 95 percent of the HIV-positive inmates are
serving time for drug-related crimes, with the ratio reaching 99
percent among HIV-positive female inmates. More worrisome is the fact
that female HIV-positive inmates are getting younger, he added.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Cheng said, the MOJ has directed
correctional institutions to step up education of imprisoned drug
addicts in cooperation with local health units to help them
understand the risks and hazards of sharing syringes with other drug
abusers.</P>
      <P>An MOJ study showed that HIV-positive inmates are most worried
about their job prospects in their post-incarceration life. Cheng
said the MOJ has begun to cooperate with private social groups and
corporations to offer job opportunities, psychological counseling and
medical assistance to released HIV-positive convicts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WVT APPEALS FOR HELP FOR AIDS ORPHANS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>World Vision Taiwan (WVT), a Christian
charity dedicated to helping disadvantaged people and carrying out
emergency humanitarian relief missions, called on the public Friday
to extend a helping hand to millions of children around the world who
have lost one or both parents to AIDS.</P>
      <P>The WVT, which has taken part in various global AIDS prevention
and aid programs for more than 13 years, made the appeal in
conjunction with the commemoration of Dec. 1 World AIDS Day -- a day
of action on HIV and AIDS.</P>
      <P>Noting that World AIDS Day is a time to remember those who have
lost their lives to the disease, admire the bravery of those living
with HIV, and raise awareness and money to help the victims, the WVT
urged local people to donate funds for AIDS orphans in Taiwan and in
other countries around the world.</P>
      <P>Prospective donors are welcome to sign up via the Internet at
http: //www.worldvision.org.tw/edm/20061127aidschild/ or deposit
funds in the WVT's postal account at 15752467.</P>
      <P>Quoting U.N. tallies, the WVT said the world now has 15 million
AIDS orphans. As most HIV carriers are middle-aged people, the number
of AIDS orphans is expected to increase further in the next few
years.</P>
      <P>Since the first AIDS case was detected in 1981, the WVT said HIV
infection has spread so rapidly and extensively that it has become
not just a health problem but also a grave social issue.</P>
      <P>Of the 8.3 million HIV carriers in Asia, two-thirds are in India,
the WVT said, adding that the number of HIV-positive people in China
has also been rising quickly to stand at about 650,000 at present.
Given the geographic proximity to China, it said, Taiwan cannot
afford to remain lax in precaution and prevention efforts.</P>
      <P>In order to create a more friendly environment for HIV carriers
and full-blown AIDS patients, the WVT said more efforts should be
devoted to reducing discrimination and stigmatization of all HIV
victims.</P>

      <P>The total passenger traffic of Taipei's mass
rapid transit (MRT) system is expected to top 2.5 billion early this
month, the Taipei Rapid Transit Corp. (TRTC) announced Friday.</P>
      <P>The figure will represent a 25-fold increase since the system's
passenger traffic reached 100 million on Dec. 22, 1998, TRCT
officials said.</P>
      <P>With a population of 23 million in Taiwan, the figure is
equivalent to 109 rides per person, they said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, for the second consecutive year, Taipei's MRT system
was rated by University of London's Railway Technology Strategy
Center as the most reliable system among the world's 25 major metro
systems in 2005, they noted.</P>
      <P>According to Deputy Taipei Mayor Chen Yu-chang, while the section
of the MRT system that is currently in operation totals 76 km,
another 76 km are under construction and 250 km are under planning.</P>
      <P>After all these projects are completed, the density of the MRT
network will be similar to that of other major metro systems in the

    <HEADLINE>TWO NOBEL LAUREATES TO SUPPORT RESEARCH AT NCKU INNOVATION CENTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two Nobel laureates will render their
support to research work to be conducted at the
soon-to-be-inaugurated Institute of Innovations and Advanced Studies
(IIAS) located at National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) in Tainan
City, southern Taiwan, school officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>Alan G. MacDiarmid, a New Zealand-born American chemist who, with
two other chemists, won the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2000, and
Aaron Ciechanover from the Israel Institute of Technology, who shared
the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2004 with two other scientists, have
been confirmed to be joining research to be carried out by the IIAS
teams to help pursue innovation and excellence in research, the NCKU
officials said.</P>
      <P>In addition to the two Nobel laureates, seven other world-class
scientists, including Paul C.W. Chu, a U.S. Presidential Science
laureate and president of Hong Kong University of Science and
Technology, and Harold Weinstock, a fellow of the U.S. Air Force
Office of Scientific Research, are also expected to render their
support to the IIAS scientific and technological research.</P>
      <P>The mission of the IIAS is for the institute to become a platform
to initiate, facilitate, and accelerate collaborative research at the
highest possible levels for Taiwan scientists with their global
counterparts, according to Tzeng Yon-hua, a member of the IEEE
Nanotechnology Council and one of the chief organizers of the IIAS.</P>
      <P>The IIAS is being established to pursue vigorously the
integration and sharing of expertise and facilities with other global
centers of excellence; jointly organize workshops to brainstorm on
and about frontier and critical research areas; and encourage and
facilitate co-directing of graduate students and postdoctoral
research fellows, Tzeng added.</P>
      <P>Members of the IIAS will thus include distinguished scholars not
only from NCKU but also from other institutions in Taiwan and around
the world.</P>
      <P>It is anticipated that the creation of such a collaborative
platform for scholars in Taiwan and abroad will allow Taiwan
scientists to be more visible globally and involved in research with
greater global impact, he noted.</P>
      <P>On the sidelines of the IIAS's inauguration ceremony, the NCKU is
also sponsoring an international academic workshop slated for Dec.
12-15. Programs of the workshop will feature discussions on
alternative/renewable energy, frontier biomedicine, enabling
materials, and micro-nano science and technology.</P>
      <P>MacDiarmid received the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2000 for his
co-discovery of conductive polymers. Prior to his discovery,
polymers, or more commonly known as plastics, were accepted to be
electrical insulators with limited high-tech applications.</P>
      <P>His contributions made possible the use of electrically
conductive plastics in many aspects of daily life, ranging from
anti-static sheets for electronic devices and flexible flat panel
displays to plastic solar cells.</P>
      <P>Facing an enormous and critical global energy crisis, MacDiarmid
has in recent years been globe trotting, urging scientific
communities from all corners of the globe to develop effective means
of producing biofuels.</P>
      <P>At the workshop, MacDiarmid will deliver two lectures, one on the
amazing electrically conductive plastics and the other on
agricultural energy.</P>
      <P>Aaron Ciechanover was awarded the 2004 Nobel Prize in chemistry
for his co-discovery of one of the most important cyclical processes
in biochemistry, namely the regulated degradation of proteins that
build up in all plants, animals and human beings.</P>
      <P>Ciechanover and the other co-winners of the 2004 Nobel Prize
worked "stubbornly" and carefully for decades on the non-mainstream
subject of cell degradation and discovered that a molecule called
ubiquitin labeled proteins that were destined to be destroyed leaving
only unlabeled and desirable proteins to be continuously built up.</P>
      <P>Known for his electrifying lectures, Ciechanover is expected to
give a lecture at the workshop on "Proteins Dynamics: The Three
Decades Journey From a Basic Biological Idea Into Human Diseases and
Drug Development."</P>
      <P>The seven other distinguished scholars -- also including
nanomaterials and nanodevices experts Donhee Ham of Harvard
University, Supriyo Bandyopadhyah of Virginia Commonwealth University
and Bin Yu of the NASA Ames Research Center -- who have agreed to
support the IIAS research endeavor, will also join the workshop,
according to Tzeng.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKER CALLS FOR ATTENTION TO ROC NATIONALS WITH AIDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A lawmaker of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) called Friday for attention to be paid to the
plight of Republic of China nationals residing overseas who cannot
return to Taiwan because they have AIDS.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Sue Huang pointed out that these ROC nationals,
mostly born overseas to ROC-citizen parents, have not registered
their households in Taiwan and that if they want to return to the
island for settlement, they first need to pass a health checkup, she
said.</P>
      <P>Under the current law, if they have AIDS, tuberculosis,
intestinal parasites or leprosy, they cannot return even if they are
ROC passport holders, Huang said.</P>
      <P>As there is no cure for AIDS, the patients are unable to return
and enjoy the rights of a citizen, she said, adding that even if they
are in Taiwan, they will be repatriated.</P>
      <P>In comparison, those who have registered their households can

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei-based China Airlines (CAL) is
scheduled to begin operating cargo flights from Taipei to Stockholm,
Sweden from Dec. 6, the first a Taiwanese carrier has entered the
Scandinavian market, CAL officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>CAL will operate a Boeing 747-400F twice weekly to Stockholm's
Arlanda International Airport, flying in from Luxembourg and
proceeding from Stockholm via Abu Dhabi to Taipei, CAL officials
said.</P>
      <P>It will be CAL's seventh all-cargo route in Europe.</P>
      <P>The new route will help reduce costs and time that would
otherwise be required for shipments delivery of Taiwan-originating
cargo to Scandinavia, the officials said.</P>
      <P>With the economies of the newly developed countries in Asia
flourishing, imports of telecommunications equipment, electronics and
vehicles have increased noticeably, they said, adding that
Scandinavian countries are prominent suppliers and exporters of these
products, making air cargo transport from Scandinavia to Asia more
critical than ever.</P>
      <P>Stockholm is the gateway to the other Scandinavian countries --

    <HEADLINE>CEC WARNS OF PUNISHMENT FOR `GHOST VOTERS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) warned
so-called "ghost voters" in Taipei and Kaohsiung cities Friday that
they will risk punishment if their false abodes are detected.</P>
      <P>According to CEC Deputy Secretary-General
Teng Tian-you, voter numbers in the two special
municipalities have "abnormally" increased over
the past few months prior to the Dec. 9 mayoral
and city council elections, as well as the Dec.
30 borough chief elections.</P>
      <P>Warning the public that they will be breaking the law if they
vote in a housing registration neighborhood where they do not really
live, Teng said the CEC has already asked the Ministry of the
Interior to step up checks of falsely registered voters in the two
cities as the elections approach.</P>
      <P>"Ghost voters" can affect election results and those people who
register a false abode in order to cast their ballots in a certain
district will be fined or otherwise punished, Teng said.</P>
      <P>Although numbers of residents in Taipei and Kaohsiung have both
declined over the past three years in a row, the two cities' voter
numbers have actually increased, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>In Taipei, the number of eligible voters had grown by 9,916 as of
the end of August compared to a year ago, while the figure for
Kaohsiung rose by 7,994, he went on.</P>
      <P>Teng voiced his doubts about the "abnormal"
voter population growth in the two special
municipalities and warned the public against
"irregularities."</P>

    <HEADLINE>COMMAND CENTER FOR RETURN OF KMT'S 'ILL-GOTTEN' ASSETS INAUGURATED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A national command center for the campaign
to demand that the opposition Kuomingtang (KMT) return its
"ill-gotten" assets to the national coffers was formally opened
Friday in the southern port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Yu Shyi-kun presided
over the inauguration ceremony along with the initiators of the
"National League For The Return of Ill-Gotten Assets, " Cheng
Cheng-yu and Wu Nan-ho.</P>
      <P>In his address, Yu expressed the hope that the civil group will
be able to collect the 1 million signatures required for the issue to
be put to a national referendum.</P>
      <P>Mentioning that on this date in 1945 the Japanese emperor
declared defeat and surrendered to end World War Two, Yu said the
emperor then promised that Japan, which had ruled Taiwan as a colony
for 50 years, would return every piece of land and all buildings and
other assets to the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, the KMT government which took over the reigns of power
in Taiwan "indulged its corrupt officials to turn them into property
of "one person and one party," Yu claimed.</P>
      <P>He also noted that his party has proposed at the Legislative Yuan
a bill regulating ways to manage "ill-gotten" assets. However, the
bill has been blocked by the KMT and its ally the People First Party,
which together hold a slim majority in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>"Fortunately, the ruling party can still force the opposition to
return its ill-gotten assets to the Taiwan people via the existing
Referendum Law," Yu said, urging people to sign the petition for the
holding of a national referendum on the issue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DIOXIN CONTENT IN FOOD BELOW ALARM LEVELS: CONSUMERS' FOUNDATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The dioxin levels in food in Taiwan are
below the alarm levels set by the Department of Health, according to
the results of a survey released Friday by the Consumers' Foundation.</P>
      <P>The survey collected 20 food samples from traditional markets
near garbage incinerators in the Peitou, Neihu, Mucha, Hsintien and
Shulin areas of Taipei City and Taipei County and from traditional
markets in areas where dioxin contamination has been reported,
including Taipei County's Pali township, Changhua County's Hsienhsi
township and the neighborhood of a plant belonging to China
Petrochemical Development Corp. in Tainan City.</P>
      <P>The samples covered five pieces of duck, four pieces of
free-range chicken, four duck eggs and one piece each of beef, pork,
goose, oyster, fish, shrimp and crab. Tests on the samples were
conducted by National Cheng Kung University's Research Center for
Environmental Trace Toxic Substances.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng Jen-hung, chairman of the foundation, the
results indicate that the cases of dioxin contamintation reported in
the country so far remain isolated incidents, but added that the
government needs to continue to monitor the situation.</P>
      <P>Wu Chia-cheng, deputy secretary-general of the foundation and a
professor of chemistry, noted that dioxins can be emitted from
natural phenomena such as volcanic eruptions and forest fires, or can
be a byproduct of chemical processing.</P>
      <P>Dioxins are also produced when organic material is burned in the
presence of chlorine, Wu added.</P>
      <P>He said dioxins can enter the body through the nose, skin or
mouth, with the ingestion of food accounting for as many as 95
percent of dioxin contaminations in humans.</P>
      <P>Dioxins generally accumulate in the fat and it takes a very long
time for the toxin to be released from the body, he said.</P>
      <P>Exposure to high levels of dioxins can cause acne and rashes,
while long-time exposure to dioxins can damage the immune, nervous,
endocrine and reproductive systems and even lead to tumors, Wu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER DPP LAWMAKER TO RETURN TO TAIWAN TO 'REGAIN PARTY'S GLORY'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York,  Nov.  30 (CNA)
(By Timothy Hwang and S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A former Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) lawmaker and Cabinet minister said in New York Thursday that he
will return to Taiwan soon in a bid to help rebuild the party's
"glorious and beautiful image."</P>
      <P>Lo Wen-chia, who had just concluded a visiting scholar program at
Harvard University, said he will "engage in direct dialogue with
voters" in Taiwan, hoping to "reignite supporters' passion" for the
DPP.</P>
      <P>But he denied that he will run for DPP chairman in anticipation
of an election failure Dec. 9, when voters in Taiwan's two largest
cities will elect their mayors and city council members.</P>
      <P>Neither will he contest a legislative seat in an election that is
scheduled for late next year, Lo told the CNA.</P>
      <P>The former protege of President Chen Sui-bian said recent remarks
he made that drew attacks from some DPP stalwarts were aimed at
"protecting the DPP and absolutely not at attacking the president or
distancing myself from the president."</P>
      <P>In a speech at Boston University Nov. 28, Lo said he had read the
prosecution's indictment against first lady Wu Shun-jean and others
on charges of embezzlement, forgery and perjury and he felt badly
that the president had given contradictory and false testimony.</P>
      <P>He also said he did not believe the president would embezzle
public funds, although the prosecutors named the first couple as
"joint perpetrators" in the corruption case.</P>
      <P>"If you listen to my Boston speech carefully, you will find it
was moderate and full of plain facts and not aimed at criticizing the
president at all," Lo said.</P>
      <P>He deplored that the DPP's "reformist and integrity images" have
been surpassed by the Kuomintang (KMT) within a short span of time,
while people's identity with the DPP has rapidly dropped.</P>
      <P>"I have a strong emotional attachment to the DPP, a party that
has achieved a great deal and a party I will never leave. I believe
many people think like me," he added.</P>
      <P>He claimed that the DPP could become Taiwan's ruling party in
2000 because it understands Taiwan's social trends and can lead
mainstream public opinion.</P>
      <P>Leading public opinion through a good grasp of the pulse of
society is the "DPP's core value" -- a core value that Lo said his
proposed "New DPP Campaign" was aiming at.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has been losing its advantages by focusing too
much on politics while ignoring much other "serious business, " Lo
said he was still confident that Taiwan will survive and thrive.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The 2006 annual labor force participation
rate among Taiwan's married women stood at a record high of 48.38
percent for May, indicating that more Taiwan housewives are working
than ever, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) reported Friday.</P>
      <P>More and more married women are willing to work or seek
employment in a bid to share the household financial burden or to
satisfy their career pride, according to DGBAS officials.</P>
      <P>The labor force participation rate is the proportion of the
population in the labor force.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS chooses May as the base month for the labor force
participation rate survey each year, as May is the least fluctuating
month in terms of employment and unemployment.</P>
      <P>This year's survey found that the labor force participation rate
among married women has risen to 48.38 percent, marking a 20-year
high. By comparison, males had a labor force participation rate of
67.36 percent, while the rate for single women stood at 55.96
percent.</P>
      <P>Labor force participation rates differed considerably by age, the
survey found. While only about 34 percent of married women aged over
45 remain in the labor force, 64.54 percent of married women aged
between 25 and 44 are in the workforce and 46.69 percent of married
women aged between 15 and 24 are in the workforce.</P>
      <P>By education background, the survey found that 66.58 percent of
the married women who have college or higher education backgrounds
are career women, followed by their counterparts with junior high
school education or lower at 33.4 percent.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that married women without children have a
participation rate as high as 71.31 percent, which declines to 58.14
percent if they have children under the age of six and drops further
to 44.67 percent if they have children over six.</P>
      <P>Using a timeline of 20 years, the DGBAS found that the labor
force participation rate married women has risen modestly but
gradually, from 41.82 percent in 1986 to 48.38 percent by May this

    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 895,000 workers in Taiwan have
thought of finding new jobs this year, accounting for 8.89 percent of
the total employed population, according to the results of a survey
released Friday by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The number marks the lowest level over the last five years since
the number of workers thinking about finding new jobs peaked at 1.02
million in 2001, DGBAS officials said.</P>
      <P>Among the workers who have thought about changing jobs this year,
514,000 are men and 381,000 are women, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The annual survey is based on labor force statistics compiled
in May.</P>
      <P>As of May, workers had remained in their present jobs for eight
years and seven months on average, which was one month longer than
last year's survey.</P>
      <P>By gender, the average length that the workers had spent on their
present jobs was nine years and six months among male workers and
seven years and five months among female workers.</P>
      <P>On the reasons why workers would think about finding new jobs,
68.26 percent said they wanted a change in their work environment,
while others said they wanted to increase their income.</P>
      <P>Of the 895,000 workers who have had the idea, 250,000, or 27.92
percent, have actually looked for new jobs. The ratio represents a
rise of 0.09 percentage points from last year and a soar of 8.74
percentage points over the past 10 years, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>By age, 15.21 percent of the workers thinking about changing jobs
are in the 15-24 age group, 6.36 percent are in the 45-64 age group
and 1.3 percent are 65 or above.</P>
      <P>While senior high school graduates account for the highest ratio
among all potential job changers, at 10.12 percent, college graduates
and those with higher education account for the lowest ratio, at 6.97
percent.</P>
      <P>By industry, the largest percentage of potential job changers are

    <HEADLINE>ANTI-GRAFT LEADER DEMANDS RELEASE OF DETAINED MILITARY INSTRUCTOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The leader of the ongoing "Million Voices
Against Corruption" campaign demanded Friday that the high school
drillmaster detained by military prosecutors three days earlier on
charges of inciting a riot because of his support for the campaign be
released immediately.</P>
      <P>Shih Ming-teh, a former chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) who launched the anti-graft campaign in early
September, warned in a statement that if the Ministry of National
Defense (MND) ignores this demand, the red-clad followers of the
campaign will take "drastic action."</P>
      <P>Army Maj. Tung Hua-cheng, a drillmaster at the Taibei High School
in Shilin, showed up at the site of the anti-graft rally Sept. 20 in
support of its demand for President Chen Shui-bian's ouster. He was
wearing his military uniform but was apparently trying to hide his
identity with a face mask and a pair of sunglasses.</P>
      <P>Tung displayed a letter he wrote to Minister of National Defense
Lee Jye, saying that in the event of a war, the rank and file
soldiers will "turn their guns inward."</P>
      <P>The military instructor could face seven years in prison for
"inciting active duty servicemen to riot" in violation of Article 16
of the Criminal Law of the Armed Forces, according to Military High
Court prosecutors.</P>
      <P>Shih is currently in Thailand attending an anti-corruption forum.
His statement, faxed to the anti-graft campaign headquarters in
Taipei, was read at a press conference on his behalf by Lin
Cheng-chieh, a deputy commander of the campaign.</P>
      <P>The statement noted that as a democratic country ruled by law,
Taiwan has come a long way from the martial law period through the
sacrifices and dedication of many people, which put the DPP in power.</P>
      <P>"The pluralism, tolerance and freedom of expression found in
Taiwan today represent a spirit that the people of Taiwan cherish and
pride themselves on most," it said.</P>
      <P>"These achievements did not come easily, yet I am afraid it will
take only overnight [for the government] to discard such treasured
values and let the people feel the 'green chilling effect,'" it
added.</P>
      <P>Green is the color chosen by the DPP for its party flag. The DPP
and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, are frequently addressed
as the "pan-green camp."</P>
      <P>Shih urged the leaders of all opposition parties to stand up on
the people's side for the detained military instructor. He also
called on government authorities to "rein in your horse at the edge
of a cliff."</P>
      <P>The anti-graft campaign's threat to take drastic action came a
day after opposition lawmakers vowed to freeze the MND's budget and
have every military leader's special fund expenditures re-examined if
Tung is not released.</P>
      <P>They contended that the prosecution of Tung on charges of
inciting a riot is a human rights violation, and that the military
officer did not do anything wrong by exercising his right to freedom
of expression.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRICEY FISH CATCH FROM CHINA NABBED IN HSINCHU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Coastal patrol officers seized late Thursday
over 30 metric tons of expensive fish smuggled in from China at the
Nanliao fishing port in northern Hsinchu county, a spokesman for the
Coast Guard Administration (CGA) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Acting on a tipoff that a fishing vessel from Hsinchu was
attempting to smuggle in fish from China, prosecutors and CGA agents
seized some 33 metric tons in seven categories of fish, including
striped mullet and pomfret, aboard a local fishing boat.</P>
      <P>The contraband catch had a market value of more than NT$20
million (US$615,000) , CGA agents estimated. They pointed out that
their information showed that the catch was not caught by the fishing
vessels, which left Hsinchu Nov. 27 to bring the contraband produce
from China.</P>
      <P>The three-member crew, including the captain, surnamed Lin, were
turned over to the Hsinchu Prosecutor's Office earlier Friday for
investigation on charges of smuggling, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>The bust was part of a four-month operation begun in November by
the CGA following orders from the Executive Yuan to stamp out
smuggling, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>He also called on the public never to purchase agricultural and
fishery products smuggled in from China because they usually contain
too many preservatives and illegal substances to keep them fresh.</P>

The Only Consensus on Iraq: Nobody's Leaving 
Right Now 

In the cacophony of competing plans about
how to deal with Iraq, one reality now appears
clear: despite the Democrats' victory this
month in an election viewed as a referendum on
the war, the idea of a rapid American troop
withdrawal is fast receding as a viable option.
On Thursday in Amman, Jordan, President Bush 
declared that Iraqis need not fear that he is 
looking for "some kind of graceful exit out
of Iraq." But a graceful exit -- or even an
awkward one -- appears to be just what the Iraq
Study Group, led by James A. Baker III and Lee
H. Hamilton, tried to design in the compromise 
reached by Republicans and Democrats on the panel
on Wednesday. The question now is whether Bush
can be persuaded to shift course.

Wall STreet Journal: Rural Renewal,
Energy Boom Lifts Small-Town Hope
On Northern Plains

A new energy boom is reviving hopes 
across North Dakota. Little towns see a golden
opportunity to stem the population decline
that has long bedeviled all of North Dakota.
Over the past two years, renewable energy 
projects that will cost more than US$1 billion
have been announced in the state, including five
ethanol plants, three biodiesel plants and five
wind farms. Oil taxes have helped to generate a
US$500 million state budget surplus. 
North Dakota's population peaked at nearly
681,000 during the Great Depression, then
gradually declined as the state bounced through 
the ups and downs of agriculture and oil, and
young people left the state for better jobs
and warmer weather. Today, with just 637,000
people, the state is so sparsely populated that
it still has a single area code.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>EXPLANATION OF FUNDS NOT INTENDED TO SWAY CASES: DGBAS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An explanation of discretionary expense
funds for President Chen Shui-bian, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou and
other senior officials is aimed at clarifying misgivings about their
use and is not intended to sway any individual cases being probed, 
the country's chief budget agency said Friday.</P>
      <P>The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS) under the Executive Yuan issued the remarks in a press
release in response to public debate after it explained the "state
affairs fund" for Chen and the "special expense fund" for Ma and
other senior officials around the island during a Cabinet meeting
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>DGBAS Minister Hsu Chang-yao said at the time that Chen's fund
should not fall under the same reimbursement rules as other general
expenses funds because it is of "a special nature, " as it combines a
"special expense fund and a secret fund."</P>
      <P>Hsu noted that the fund has been appropriated to the Presidential
Office since 1949 and has been mainly used for inspection tours at
home or abroad, giving bonuses, subsidies, hosting guests and giving
presents in a wide range of fields.</P>
      <P>Hsu's remarks were considered by some as an Executive Yuan
attempt to get Chen and Ma, as well as other officials, off the hook,
as more and more officials are being probed over the use of the
discretionary funds.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS also said in its press release that the agency has
normal exchanges with the Ministry of Audit (MOA) under the Control
Yuan and that the MOA made a regular check of accounts in
mid-November.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS was responding to reports carried by the China Times
newspaper that the MOA and the DGBAS are at loggerheads over the use
of the "state affairs fund" and that the MOA made a surprise raid on
the DGBAS to demand that Minister Hsu present all receipts claiming
reimbursement from his "special expense fund." Hsu was also forced to
turn over his "guest list" for verification.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS said the visit was arranged in late September and was
not a surprise raid.</P>
      <P>The MOA also denied that the two agencies disagree on the fund
use.</P>
      <P>At issue is the MOA's views on the "state affairs fund, " which
amounts to around NT$5 million (US$50,500) a year. The MOA has
maintained that every expense should be accompanied with invoices or
receipts for reimbursement, while the DGBAS said the fund combines a
"special expenses fund" for senior officials, only half of which
requires receipts.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors probing the alleged misuse of the "state affairs
fund" indicted first lady Wu Shu-jen Nov. 3 on embezzlement and
forgery charges after it was found that she used invoices
collected from family members and others to claim NT$14.8 million
reimbursement from the state affairs fund between July 2002 and March
2006.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors also said that had probed the possible flow of the
half of the special "state affairs fund" that the president can claim
reimbursement from without providing any proof of spending. But he
added that no hard evidence was found to show that the president had
pocketed money from this part of the fund.</P>
      <P>Chen was named along with Wu as a "joint perpetrator" but has
prosecution immunity while in office. He has denied any wrongdoing,
claiming that the use of invoices belonging to other people was to
cover expenses incurred in "secret diplomatic programs."</P>
      <P>Ma, who doubles as main opposition Kuomintang chairman, has also
been questioned by prosecutors twice over his mishandling of his own
"special expenses fund, " when a staff member of the Taipei city
government was caught using larger-amount invoices claiming
reimbursement in lieu of hundreds of smaller-amount invoices to claim
reimbursement from half of the fund, NT$170,000 per month, that 
requires receipts.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors are also investigating if half of the "proof-free"
fund deposited directly into Ma's personal account might not have
been used for official duties but to line his pocket.</P>
      <P>Minister of Justice Shih Mao-lin also said in Wednesday's Cabinet
meeting that the "special expense funds" for senior officials were
"de facto special allowances" for the officials and can be kept if
they are not used up by the end of the year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S UNIVERSITY TUITION TO BE RAISED BETWEEN 2.4%, 10%</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tuition fees for public universities around
the country will be raised from 2.4 percent to 10 percent next year
to meet rising costs and upgrade facilities, National Taiwan
University (NTU) President Lee Si-chen revealed Friday.</P>
      <P>Lee said the tuition adjustment plan was proposed at an earlier
board meeting of the Association of National Universities of Taiwan
(ANUT) , with participants all agreeing a tuition hike would help
efforts to maintain teaching quality at the institutions.</P>
      <P>Lee, who is also chairman of the association, explained that the
island's consumer price index has seen an average yearly growth of
2.4 percent to 2.5 percent.</P>
      <P>"The planned hike would only help schools offset the annual
inflation," he said.</P>
      <P>A university has to continue investing in upgrading software and
hardware to boost its competitiveness, Lee said, noting that in this
regard, a tuition hike has to surpass the annual growth rate in cost
levels.</P>
      <P>Therefore, NTU intends to raise its tuition fees by 2 percent-3
percent next year, Lee added.</P>
      <P>The general tuition hike plan will be submitted to the 2007
conference of Taiwan's university presidents for discussion. It is
expected the hike will take effect at the start of the 2007 academic
year in September, according to Lee.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN TAIWAN'S CREATIVE INDUSTRY: III</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan needs to step up efforts to develop
its creative industry as its output in the field pales in comparison
with leading countries, a representative of the Institute for
Information Industry (III) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's 2004 output in the creative industry was US$17 billion,
only slightly more than one-tenth of the U.K.'s output of US$160
billion. The numbers indicate Taiwan has a long way to go in
developing the industry, said Ho Wen-hsiung, director of III's
Industry Support Division.</P>
      <P>China's creative industry output is US$220 billion annually,
while Japan checks in at US$130 billion, only slightly less than its
well-known auto industry, Ho added.</P>
      <P>With its reputation in creative industries throughout Asia,
Taiwan should do better than that, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is capable of turning the tide in the sector of the
digital creative industry, given its advantage in information and
communication technology and rich cultural assets, Ho said.</P>
      <P>It's never too late to start developing the creative industry,
which makes up an integral part of a knowledge-based economy. And it
is a route that Taiwan has to take because its output in the computer
hardware industry went from US$20 billion in 2001 to US$10 billion in
2004, Ho noted.</P>
      <P>"In fact, the creative industry is not a new industry. It is just
a new integration of value chains," Ho pointed out.</P>
      <P>III was established in 1979 as a non-profit organization, jointly
sponsored by Taiwan's government and dozens of prominent private
enterprises, for the purpose of growing and strengthening Taiwan's
information industry development.</P>

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou said Friday that his party will not "compete for worst
record" with other political parties and neither will it build its
own success on other parties' failures.</P>
      <P>Pepping up KMT nominees for the Dec. 30 ward chief elections, Ma
urged the party's mayors, councilors and ward chiefs to "be clean and
diligent, and love the people."</P>
      <P>He said the KMT won the three-in-one local elections late last
year because the party had high morale, while the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) was embroiled in a string of corruption
charges.</P>
      <P>This year, the DPP has been bogged down by even more corruption
scandals and has been "abandoned" by the people of Taiwan, Ma
claimed, urging the KMT members not to "relish a rival that is
corrupted by power."</P>
      <P>"We must not make the same mistakes or walk on the same path as
the DPP," he said. "Instead, we should learn lessons from its failure
and map out a strategy for our party's development," he added.</P>
      <P>The DPP motto is "be clean and diligent, and love the homeland"
-- just one word different from Ma's proposed maxim for KMT

University presented 1,000 paper cranes to Taichung Mayor Jason Hu
through his deputy Friday, hoping good wishes brought by the origami
birds will help the mayor's wife recover from injuries suffered in a
recent car accident.</P>
      <P>Taichung's Deputy Mayor Hsiao Chia-chi accepted the paper cranes
from representatives of the university's Student Association at the
Taichung City Council, promising to relay the good wishes to the
mayor, who has stayed at Chi Mei Medical Center in Tainan County
since Nov. 18 to be with his seriously injured wife, Shao Hsiao-ling.</P>
      <P>The mayor's wife is still in the hospital's intensive care unit.
She has been in a coma since the accident, although doctors have said
she is not in critical condition. A medical team performed two
separate surgical operations, amputating her left forearm and a
ruptured spleen.</P>
      <P>Feng Chia students were especially shocked by the bad news
because on Nov. 15 -- only three days before the car accident -- they
met with the mayor on campus and accepted his congratulations for the
university's 45th anniversary.</P>
      <P>Leading members of the student association said they were stunned
by the Nov. 18 accident, because only a day earlier they had been
accorded warm hospitality when they paid a visit to the mayor and the
Taichung City Council.</P>
      <P>The Student Association launched a drive last month, asking Feng
Chia students to fold 1,000 paper cranes and to pray for the early

      <P>The crane is a symbol of longevity in China, Japan and other

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is expected to announce
details of its five-point policy guidelines for the country's five
free-trade zones at the end of this year after holding three seminars
this month, officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) has set
up free-trade zones in four sea ports in Keelung, Taipei (Bali) ,
Taichung and Kaohsiung, and at Taoyuan International Airport.</P>
      <P>The project, launched in 2003, aims to make Taiwan an
international business operation center that offers infrastructure
and services facilitating the flow of capital, people, commodities
and information.</P>
      <P>To achieve that end, the CEPD has drafted five policy guidelines:
introduce a global operation mechanism for commodity flow; improve
the operating environment for international commodity flow; provide
services to builders of the commodity flow infrastructure; strengthen
the functions of free-trade zones; and revitalize market functions.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials said Taiwan is a key transshipment center for East
Asia and North America. Besides its geographical advantage, Taiwan --
as the world's 16th largest trading nation with annual trade
worth US$381 billion (2005) -- also enjoys a competitive edge in
serving as a dispatch base for countries buying products from China
and Southeast Asia, they said.</P>
      <P>In the light of these advantages, they said Taiwan should seize
the opportunity to transform itself into a transshipment center, as
well as a provider of services to business operators.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
issued an "orange-level" travel advisory against Fiji Friday, urging
locals to refrain for the time being from visiting the South Pacific
island country out of safety concerns.</P>
      <P>On the ministry's travel advisory scale, an orange-level alert
is the second most serious warning.</P>
      <P>Noting that Fiji's political situation has become volatile after
its embattled prime minister and other senior officials went into
hiding earlier in the day amid the threat of a military coup, MOFA
officials said locals should suspend business or sightseeing
trips to that country at this time.</P>
      <P>Those already there should avoid public demonstrations or
assembly venues for the sake of their own safety, the officials said.
If necessary, they can contact the country's representative office in
Fiji via its round-the-clock emergency hotline: 679-992-6661.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the officials said locals had better avoid visiting
the Yiksan region in South Korea's North Cholla Province at this time
because of a recent outbreak of the H5N1 strain of avian influenza
there. The South Korean government has taken steps to prevent further
spread of the outbreak. Visitors to South Korea should shun the

      <P>Private consumer spending in the fourth

      <P>Business revenues generated by wholesalers, retailers, and

    <HEADLINE>ACTING KAOHSIUNG MAYOR URGED TO MAINTAIN ADMINISTRATIVE NEUTRALITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung, Dec. 1. 30 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The campaign office of the opposition
Kuomintang's (KMT) Kaohsiung mayoral candidate, Huang Chun-ying,
urged acting Kaohsiung Mayor Yeh Chu-lan Friday to maintain
administrative neutrality in the lead-up to the Dec. 9 mayoral
election.</P>
      <P>Huang's spokesman pointed out at a press conference that Yeh and
some 20 department chiefs in the Kaohsiung city government have taken
leave Dec. 1-8 to canvass for Chen Chu, the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) candidate, in an attempt to boost her chances
of an election victory.</P>
      <P>"It is unprecedented that a Kaohsiung mayor and so many
department chiefs take an eight-day leave collectively," said Chen
Shei-saint, a former KMT legislator.</P>
      <P>"Doesn't the city government have anything else to do in the next
week except help Chen Chu with her election campaign?" he asked.</P>
      <P>"There are urgent matters the acting mayor should attend to, such
as the spread of dengue fever," he said, adding, "We have already
seen three deaths from dengue hemorrhagic fever last month, and the
city government should attach more importance to the lives of
Kaohsiung residents than to the election campaign."</P>
      <P>The acting mayor is serving as the head of Chen Chu's election
campaign and is apparently doing her utmost in the final dash to help
the DPP candidate get elected on Dec. 9, so she can smoothly hand
over the reins to Chen Chu on Dec. 25.</P>
      <P>Chen Chu, former chairwoman of the Council of Labor Affairs, is
still lagging in opinion polls behind Huang.</P>
      <P>Results of a Nov. 27 DPP survey show her still trailing 3 percent
behind Huang in voter approval ratings, but another poll conducted by
the United Daily News a day earlier placed Chen Chu at 29 percent,
and Huang at 38 percent.</P>
      <P>The DPP customarily gets strong backing in Kaohsiung and has
defeated the KMT in the two previous mayoral elections.</P>
      <P>Analysts believe Chen Chu's poor performance is due mainly to
negative publicity about the first family's alleged involvement in an
embezzlement case that has led public prosecutors to indict first
lady Wu Shu-jen and to name the first couple as "joint perpetrators."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
issued an "orange-level" travel advisory against Fiji Friday, urging
locals to refrain for the time being from visiting the South Pacific
island country out of safety concerns.</P>
      <P>On the ministry's travel advisory scale, an orange-level alert
is the second most serious warning.</P>
      <P>Noting that Fiji's political situation has become volatile after
its embattled prime minister and other senior officials went into
hiding earlier in the day amid the threat of a military coup, MOFA
officials said locals should suspend business or sightseeing
trips to that country at this time.</P>
      <P>Those already there should avoid public demonstrations or
assembly venues for the sake of their own safety, the officials said.
If necessary, they can contact the country's representative office in
Fiji via its round-the-clock emergency hotline: 679-992-6661.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the officials said locals had better avoid visiting
the Yiksan region in South Korea's North Cholla Province at this time
because of a recent outbreak of the H5N1 strain of avian influenza
there. The South Korean government has taken steps to prevent further
spread of the outbreak. Visitors to South Korea should shun the
affected region and avoid coming into contact with poultry and wild
birds, and avoid eating raw poultry.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEMAND FOR FOREIGN CAREGIVERS GROWS SUBSTANTIALLY: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Domestic demand for foreign caregivers has
spiked significantly since the beginning of this year, with the
annual growth rate hitting 9.3 percent for the first 10 months, the
country's top economic planning agency said Saturday.</P>
      <P>As of the end of October, the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) said the number of foreign laborers
in Taiwan had reached 336,985, up a whopping 16,371 or 5.1 percent
from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>The bulk of foreign laborers worked in the manufacturing sector,
accounting for 169,065 of the total and marking an increase of 4,746
over the same period last year, according to CEPD tallies.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials attributed the increase mainly to a new
market-opening measure adopted in January that allows 19 "dirty,
arduous and dangerous" manufacturing industries, better known as "3K'
industries, to hire foreign workers.</P>
      <P>Caregivers formed the second largest foreign labor group, with
the number increasing 12,839 or 9.3 percent year-on-year to 150,326
at the end of October.</P>
      <P>The third largest foreign labor group was in the
construction sector, but the number shrank 11.1 percent to a mere
12,049, according to the same tallies.</P>
      <P>While local society remains divided over the consequences of an
influx of foreign caregivers, CEPD officials said the government has
sped up a "good housekeeper" project aimed at encouraging local women
to receive training and become licensed caregivers.</P>
      <P>With an aging local population, the officials said Taiwan needs to
train more local caregivers to meet the skyrocketing market demand.</P>
      <P>Under the "good housekeeper" project, the officials said the
government plans to train a total of 30,000 local home care providers
in the coming two years. The Ministry of the Interior has so far
offered pre-job or on-the-job training courses for 12,000 local home
care providers, social workers at senior citizens' homes and
caregivers for people with mental or physical disabilities.</P>
      <P>In addition, the officials said, the Ministry of Education, the
Department of Health and Council of Labor Affairs have also
organized various training programs for would-be local caregiving
personnel over the past year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP TO FOCUS ON 'GETTING OUT THE VOTE' AS ELECTIONS DRAW NEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With only one week remaining before mayor
and city councilor races are held Dec. 9 in Taipei and Kaohsiung, the
presidential office, Executive Yuan and ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) are pulling out all the stops in a "get out the vote"
campaign, DPP officials said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The officials said supporters of the "pan-green camp" led by the
DPP are traditionally more enthusiastic in elections than their
counterparts of the "pan-blue alliance" led by main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>But a series of alleged corruption scandals implicating the
members of President Chen's family and senior aides this year --
with the latest a Nov. 3 indictment of first lady Wu Shu-jen on
embezzlement and forgery charges -- have seriously dented the
popularity not only of the president but also the ruling party, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>With support dampened, they estimated the turnout of "pan-green
camp" supporters will drop to around 60 percent from 80 percent in
the past, although they estimated they would have a greater chance of
winning if the turnout rate could surpass 70 percent.</P>
      <P>If they cannot tap supporters' passion for the DPP in the
final stage before the elections, they estimated the turnout rate
might only be 65 percent in Taipei and lower than 70 percent in
Kaohsiung, traditionally a stronghold of the DPP.</P>
      <P>They said that DPP polls showed support for Chen Chu, the DPP
candidate for Kaohsiung mayor, still lagging by three percentage
points behind her rival, Huang Jun-ying of the KMT. Pointing out the
figure falls within the margin of error, they said stumping efforts
and canvassing in the last week will be crucial.</P>
      <P>In Taipei, although Frank Hsieh, the DPP's candidate for Taipei
mayor, still lags behind KMT candidate Hau Lung-bin, support for him
has steadily risen, they said. This, coupled with possible changes
within the "pan-blue alliance," could bring about a turnaround at any
time, they said.</P>
      <P>James Soong, who has taken leave as chairman of the
People First Party -- an ally of the KMT -- to run in the Taipei
mayoral election, and Lee Ao, an independent legislator, are
considered by some to divide the "pan-blue" vote.</P>
      <P>Chen Chu will hold a large "hand-in-hand" rally by the side of
Love River Sunday, with the participation of four DPP heavyweights --
DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun, Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su
Tseng-chang and Hsieh. President Chen is also expected to attend.</P>
      <P>DPP officials said they are hoping that Sunday's rally will
recreate a similar effect like the "one million people hand-in-hand"
campaign that was launched prior to the 2004 presidential election,
considered a major event that catapulted Chen into his
second term as president.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, although President Chen has not arranged any stumping
activities for Hsieh in Taipei City, Cho Jung-tai, deputy
secretary-general of the Presidential Office and a protege of
Hsieh, has already taken leave to campaign for Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Hsieh will hold a carnival-like rally to drum up support at the 
Taipei Arena stadium Nov.7.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 60 foreign spouses of Taiwanese,
dressed in the traditional costume of their motherland, took part in
singing and oral reading competitions Saturday in central Taichung
city at an event organized by the Executive Yuan to help foreign
spouses learn Mandarin or local dialects.</P>
      <P>Lin Feng-hsi, executive director of the Executive Yuan's Central
Taiwan Joint Services Center, said singing and reading are helpful
ways to learn a foreign language. In this regard, his center has
organized various singing and reading-oriented courses and activities
for foreign spouses to help them blend into the local culture.</P>
      <P>Besides existing courses and activities, the center will also
assist foreign spouses by opening extra courses in Mandarin or a
local dialect if a group of at least 15 people can be organized for a
private course, Lin noted.</P>
      <P>Foreign spouses play an increasingly important role in Taiwan,
with one out of every five newlywed couples involving intermarriage
and one out of every 6.5 babies born to foreign mothers -- mostly
from China and Southeast Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Foreign spouses face many difficulties while trying to adapt to
the local society, including differences in language, culture, social
customs, identity, sense of participation, and education of the

    <HEADLINE>TURN DEMOCRACY INTO DRIVE HELPING TAIWAN'S UNITY: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged the nation
Saturday to turn democracy into a drive that is favorable to the
country's solidarity, rather than allowing it to become a barricade.</P>
      <P>In his written address to the 6th World Taiwanese Congress held
in Taipei, Chen said democracy should be a force that helps Taiwan
become a "normal, complete and great" nation.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the power of the people has contributed toward
great progress in the country's democratic development in past
decades.</P>
      <P>In today's Taiwan, Chen said, differences in opinion enjoy full
protection by the Constitution, with every individual entitled to the
right to express their views without having to worry about being
suppressed or persecuted, which is the pride and value of Taiwan's
democracy and a sign of great social progress.</P>
      <P>While people are allowed to disagree with each other, they must
not damage the country's solidarity, Chen said.</P>
      <P>While people can be divided on the issue of their national
identity, the country must not be allowed to split, nor should the
government be allowed to become inoperative, Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, in an ever-changing international situation,
Taiwan must stick to the universal values of freedom, democracy,
peace and human rights and establish a value-based alliance with the
world's democratic community to deepen and consolidate democracy
around the globe.</P>
      <P>Also addressing the congress, Tan Sun Chen, secretary-general to
the Presidential Office, said the issue of whether President Chen
should resign over the alleged "state affairs fund" scandal is not a
personal affair but a question that concerns the whole nation.</P>
      <P>For the sake of the country's 23 million people, the president
must hold on and serve out his term until May 20, 2008, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The prosecution indicted first lady Wu Shu-jen on charges of
forgery and corruption Nov. 3 after determining she had used receipts
provided by others to claim reimbursements totaling NT$14.8 million
(US$450,000) from the president's "state affairs fund" between July
2002 and March 2006.</P>
      <P>President Chen was named along with his wife but was not charged
because of his constitutional immunity from prosecution as head of
state.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed none of the money went into his own pocket and vowed
to resign if the first lady is found guilty in the first trial.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN AID HELPS INDONESIAN SCHOOLCHILDREN REGAIN HOPE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Nias, Indonesia, Dec.1 (CNA)
(By Charles Kang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nefi, a 10-year-old Indonesian girl,
was all smiles Friday when she joined with her teacher and classmates
to welcome an aid supervisory delegation from Taiwan that had
arrived to inspect her school in Nias, one of the hardest-hit regions
in the 2004 earthquake and tsunami catastrophe.</P>
      <P>The fourth grader recalled that she was reduced to tears when her
earthquake-and-tsunami-destroyed Tetehosi Idanoi Elementary School
came into her sight for the first time two months after the tragedy.</P>
      <P>"School was my most favored place to study and play. I prayed for
God's help, wishing someone would help us rebuild our school... It
was so great that my dream has come true, with help from Taiwan. Now
we have new classrooms, new schoolbags, uniforms and textbooks. We
can go to school again every day," Nefi said.</P>
      <P>Nefi said she has studied very hard since her school re-opened
under financial aid from Taiwan. She won a championship in a recent
Indonesian speech contest at her school.</P>
      <P>Nefi joined other students in signing the "Song of Nias" to
welcome the visitors from Taiwan, including Hsu Kuo-lang, head of the
secretarial department of the Government Information Office (GIO) ,
Lin Chia-lung, a former GIO minister who is now secretary-general of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, and senior executives of
World Vision Taiwan (WVT).</P>
      <P>The Tetehosi Idanoi Elementary School reconstruction project is
part of a "10,000 Hopes" plan initiated by then-GIO Minister Lin
Chia-lung in the wake of the devastating earthquake and tsunami
disaster in late 2004, which killed more than 200,000 people in
several South and Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia, Sri
Lanka and Thailand.</P>
      <P>The "10,000 Hopes" plan was aimed at helping 10,000 children in
tsunami-affected areas for three years. Taiwanese citizens and
corporations donated more than NT$400 million to the project.</P>
      <P>The "10,000 Hopes" supervisory commission has cooperated with
World Vision Taiwan, a Christian charity, in carrying out school
reconstruction projects on the Indonesian island of Nias.</P>
      <P>With a sum of NT$108 million for the Nias rehabilitation project,
World Vision Taiwan has not only helped rebuild schools in Nias but
also helped parents of schoolchildren rebuild their life and careers.
The charity has arranged for parents of schoolchildren to help build
classrooms and roads in the vicinity as well as other public
facilities.</P>
      <P>This is the second consecutive year that Lin has traveled to
Indonesia to look into implementation of the "10,000 Hopes" project.
Lin said he is very pleased to see it progressing smoothly.</P>
      <P>"Last year, many schoolchildren were still barefoot and had no
uniform and schoolbags. This time around, we see them come to school
joyfully in neat uniforms and shoes with textbooks and stationery in
their schoolbags, " Lin said. "From their bright smiles, I feel our
altruistic efforts have come to fruition."</P>
      <P>It is hoped the three-year aid project can come to a smooth close
next year, with 10,000 children in the tsunami-disaster zone
receiving good care and true benefits.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Lin and other "10,000 Hopes" project
supervisors paid a visit to North Nias District Administrator
Binahati B. Baeha.</P>
      <P>Baeha expressed his heartfelt thanks to Taiwan's generous
humanitarian aid to his district. He said he hopes to visit Taiwan in
the future to promote bilateral goodwill exchanges and foster
friendship.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A former Cabinet member from the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Saturday he was returning to
Taiwan to "restore the party's glory, " which he considered as having
been tainted in the past few years.</P>
      <P>Lo Wen-chia, who used to be one of President Chen Shui-bian's
trusted proteges and also an ex-DPP lawmaker, made the remarks upon
arrival from the United States at Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport.</P>
      <P>Lo is expected to face strong criticism and questions from DPP
colleagues after his recent remarks in the United States, in which he
commented frankly on the party and Chen's management of the
president's discretionary "state affairs fund."</P>
      <P>In a speech he gave at Boston University late last month, Lo said
he had read the prosecutor's indictment against first lady Wu
Shun-jen on charges of embezzling the president's "state affairs
fund, " and felt badly the president had provided false testimony in
the case.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors indicted Wu on charges of forgery and corruption
Nov. 3, after determining she had used the receipts or invoices of
others to claim funds totaling NT$14.8 million (US$450,000) from the
president's "state affairs fund" during the period 2002-2006.</P>
      <P>President Chen was named along with his wife in the corruption
charges but was not charged because of his constitutional immunity
from prosecution as head of state.</P>
      <P>Lo said he believes the president had no intention of embezzling
public funds, but that he made some "procedural mistakes" in using
the "state affairs fund."</P>
      <P>On the first lady's being indicted, Lo also suggested that the
party should not have double standards in handling the first lady's
case by not suspending her party membership rights.</P>
      <P>Lo said he knew very well that he would face much criticism
against him after his frank remarks toward the party and first
family.</P>
      <P>However, Lo said, his speech was not aimed at criticizing the
president, but that he had just "reminded" the president, as he
maintains close relations with Chen.</P>
      <P>Noting that some have exaggerated his remarks, Lo said he brought
back a video of his speech from the U.S., hoping that it would
clarify what he really said in the speech.</P>
      <P>Referring to the mayoral elections on Dec. 9, Lo said those DPP
candidates are all the party's elite, and that he would stand with
DPP supporters to help restore the party's glory and fame.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian lauded the
Kaohsiung mass rapid transit (MRT) system as even better than its
Taipei counterpart after taking a test ride Saturday.</P>
      <P>The president, accompanied by acting Kaohsiung Mayor Yeh Chu-lan
and Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. Chairman Chiang Yao-tsung, rode an
8 km section of the red line between Far Eastern Department Store and
Hsiaokang.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that 20,000 people had taken the
test ride on the same section, with over 95 percent expressing
satisfaction with the smooth travel. The MRT's red and orange lines
are scheduled to be inaugurated at the end of 2007.</P>
      <P>Chiang, who previously served in Taipei rapid transit system,
said the Kaohsiung MRT system has been efficient and that the BOT
(build-operate-transfer) model of construction has saved the
government NT$44.4 billion (US$1.34 billion). The cost of personnel
is also cheaper and more job opportunities have been created, Chiang
added.</P>
      <P> President Chen took the opportunity to praise former
Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh for his willpower and outstanding sense
of responsibility, saying Hsieh had laid a solid foundation for the
MRT's construction while serving between 1998 and 2005. Hsieh, the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate in the Taipei
mayoral election, stepped down to take the premier post in January
2005.</P>
      <P>President Chen, who has been mired in alleged corruption scandals
implicating his family members and senior officials, was in high
spirits Saturday.</P>
      <P>He said he will be attending a "hand-in-hand" rally Sunday by the
side of Ai River, also known as Love River, to drum up support for
Chen Chu, the DPP candidate for Kaohsiung mayor.</P>
      <P>The president, who visited a night market to canvass votes
for Chen Chu Friday, said he loved Kaohsiung city very much and
twice mentioned he will move to Kaohsiung after leaving office

    <HEADLINE>POST-SURGERY SURVIVAL RATE OF LUNG CANCER PATIENTS TOPS 50%: STUDY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 50 percent of lung cancer patients
survive at least five years after surgery, according to the results
of a study released Saturday by the Taiwan Lung Cancer Society.</P>
      <P>The study, unveiled during the Asia-Pacific Congress on Lung
Cancer and the 10th Annual Meeting of the Taiwan Cooperative Oncology
Group held in Taipei, is based on an analysis of 971 lung cancer
patients who underwent surgery at Taipei Veterans General Hospital
over the past 20 years.</P>
      <P>The study found 52.5 percent of lung cancer patients survive at
least five years after surgery, and the five-year survival rate could
even reach 68.4 percent if the patients did not fall victim to other
diseases.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-yi, president of the society, said it is mistaken for
patients to think they are doomed to perish after being diagnosed
with lung cancer.</P>
      <P>Many lose their appetite and a lot of sleep over their disease
and would rather follow some unscientific therapies than undergo
surgery out of fear, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, unlike in the past when some of the patient's
ribs had to be removed in lung cancer surgery, today's operations
leave only an incision 10 cm to 12 cm in length, thanks to
thoracoscopy and progress in anesthetic technology.</P>
      <P>While the surgery takes a very short time to complete, patients
can eat and get out of bed hours after the surgery and be discharged
from the hospital within four to five days, Chen said.</P>
      <P>For patients whose lung cancer has proceeded to stage II or stage
III, their survival rate will increase by five percent to 10 percent
if they receive chemotherapy after surgery, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Chen said smokers, those with a chronic cough, those who are
frequently exposed to second-hand smoke or have a family history of
lung cancer are at high risk of suffering from the disease and should
receive regular health checkups to ensure early diagnosis.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BREAKTHROUGH SEEN IN EARLY LUNG CANCER DIAGNOSIS RESEARCH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Researchers from the National Research
Program for Genomic Medicine (NRPGM) have discovered several genes
that play a decisive role in the formation and transfer of lung
cancer.</P>
      <P>Distinguished investigator Wu Cheng-wen of the Institute of
Cancer Research at the National Health Research Institutes (NHRI)
reported the breakthrough in research on lung cancer transfer and
deterioration Saturday at an Asia-Pacific lung cancer conference.</P>
      <P>Wu warned that in 2006, lung cancer was the top killer in Taiwan
and that the rate of growth in lung cancer cases in Taiwan has risen
to become the world's highest. Mentioning that smoking can
undoubtedly cause lung cancer, Wu said in Taiwan, however, 90 percent
of female lung cancer patients were found to have never even smoked.</P>
      <P>For this reason, the NHRI began efforts years ago to find out
what causes people to suffer from lung cancer, yielding recent
rewards when researchers found that besides passive smoking, air
pollution and oil smoke, genes also plays a key role in lung cancer's
formation.</P>
      <P>The NHRI have discovered several genes related to the disease, Wu
said, noting that if all the genes mutate, the risk of getting lung
cancer will surge to become 20-30 times greater.</P>
      <P>Wu explained gene mutation may be congenital or result from other
factors, including aging. By pinpointing pathogenic genes, it is
possible to discover signs of lung cancer through preventive screen
tests. Even further, it is also feasible for physicians to design a
personal treatment program for each lung cancer patient.</P>
      <P>In the next stage, genetic research will focus on the puzzle of
why lung cancer spreads easily to the brain, bones and liver,
according to the NHRI.</P>

      <P>In a speech given at the World Taiwanese Congress at the Grand

    <HEADLINE>KMT CARES MOST ABOUT PRESIDENT DELIVERING ON HIS WORDS: CAUCUS WHIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said Saturday that the party cares more
about the president delivering on his word than where the wife of
President Chen Shui-bian's son gives birth.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chin-lung, a KMT legislative caucus whip, made the remarks
one day after Cheng Chih-chung, the president's son, and his wife
Huang Jui-ching, returned from the United States.</P>
      <P>The first son and his wife flew to the U.S. in late October after
visiting the first lady, Wu Shu-jen, who was said to be in poor
health due to the investigation into alleged embezzlement of public
funds. Huang, who is now seven months pregnant, unexpectedly became
an issue during the upcoming election after the opposition speculated
whether the first son intended to have his child born in the U.S. to
get a U.S. citizenship.</P>
      <P>Noting that the president openly stated in September that he
would not like to be called a "grandfather of an American, " the KMT
demanded that he deliver on his promise.</P>
      <P>Also, in a previous presidential election, the president once
lambasted his rival as "unpatriotic" after the rival's grandson was
born in the United States, so the opposition has asked the president
to apply the same criteria.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the party took in stride the return of the first son
and his wife, saying they are both adults and can choose to give
birth here or in the United States.</P>
      <P>Their return is "not a big deal, " and only means the president
has delivered on his word, and that the KMT will not touch on the
subject again, he added.</P>
      <P>He also said it should not affect the Dec. 9 Taipei and Kaohsung
mayoral elections amid reports that the "pan-green camp" led by the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party was greatly boosted by the return
of the first son and his wife.</P>
      <P>Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng also said Saturday that the
Chen couple's return will not sway voters in the upcoming
election, but "if they didn't return, the DPP stands to lose some of
its core supporters."</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks while stumping for Huang Jun-ying, the
KMT's candidate in the Kaohsiung mayoral election, in the southern
Taiwan port city.</P>
      <P>Wang, a former KMT vice chairman, said both the DPP and KMT have
solidified their core supporters, and that Huang's return will not
lure away any of those voters who have made up their minds.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>As thousands pack the exhibition hall for
the 2006 Information Technology (IT) Month, Taiwan can look back at
the past year and forward to the future with a sense of
accomplishment, organizers and officials said Saturday.</P>
      <P>"Entering its 27th year, IT Month has become the most compelling
and significant year-end event for Taiwan's IT industry and
consumers. We estimate more than two million visitors will visit the
fair this year, " said Frank Huang, president of the Taipei Computer
Association, IT Month's main organizer.</P>
      <P>About 350 companies set up more than 1,700 booths at the fair,
which is taking place in Taipei from Dec. 2-10, and will head south
for shows in Taichung Dec. 15-20, Tainan Dec. 28-Jan. 2 and Kaohsiung
Jan. 11-16, 2007.</P>
      <P>While consumers care most about cheap computer prices, the fair
also provides Taiwan's IT industry a chance to look back
retrospectively as well as consider future prospects.</P>
      <P>And the results are not disappointing. Despite all the theories
of economic "hollowing out" in news reports, Taiwanese companies have
been doing well in global markets, manufacturing more than 98 percent
of computer motherboards and controlling the manufacture of about 87
percent of laptop computers, said Minister of Economic Affairs Chen
Ruey-long.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's brand development and industrial design has received
much positive feedback over the past year, winning 146 international
industrial design awards and boosting Taiwan's confidence in its
value-added efforts. Taiwan has been doing well in foundry, packaging
tests, and flat panel sectors as well, Chen added.</P>
      <P>However Taiwan will be facing challenges in the upcoming year.</P>
      <P>"We'll see a lot of changes in the upcoming year, with the launch
of a new Microsoft computer system, Vista, and emerging development
of 3G mobile phones, " said Frank Huang, adding that Taiwan needs to
devote more energy to digital content development to catch up with
South Korea.</P>
      <P>"Without a doubt, the IT and digital industries will be Taiwan's
lifelines in the future," Huang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CALLS FOR END TO SMEAR CAMPAIGN AFTER RETURN OF PRESIDENT'S SON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) urged the opposition "pan-blue alliance" Saturday to put a stop
to its smear campaign against President Chen Shui-bian's son and
daughter-in-law now that the couple have returned home.</P>
      <P>DPP Deputy Secretary-General Tsai Huang-liang made the call after
Chen Chih-chung and his pregnant wife Huang Jui-ching returned to
Taipei from the United States late last night.</P>
      <P>Over the past two weeks, Tsai said some opposition politicians
have relentlessly tried to "play up" the rumor that Huang, who is
seven months pregnant, will give birth in the United States to
facilitate her citizenship application.</P>
      <P>The rumor has even been blown up into a bizarre claim that if the
DPP loses the Dec. 9 municipal elections in Taipei and Kaohsiung,
Huang and her husband Chen Chih-chung should be held accountable,
Tsai regretted, adding that the speculation has caused "unbearable
pressure" on the young couple.</P>
      <P>"Now that the couple have returned, we are hopeful that all the
rumors and smears against the first family can come to a halt. As a
matter of fact, Huang has never said she would not return to Taiwan
to deliver her first baby," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the topic about where the couple will live has
nothing to do with the upcoming election, Tsai urged the opposition
camp to shift their focus to major policy issues and respect the
president's son and daughter-in-law's privacy.</P>
      <P>Before his return, the president's son had been interning at a law
firm in New York after obtaining master's degrees in law from two
noted U.S. universities in the past two years.</P>
      <P>Some DPP politicians have claimed that the opposition camp and
certain media outlets had been deliberately playing up the story in a
bid to divert people's attention from a scandal involving Taipei
Mayor Ma Ying-jeou's alleged misuse of a discretionary fund for his
use.</P>
      <P>Just Wednesday, the president's son filed a defamation lawsuit
against opposition Kuomintang Legislator Chiu Yi over Chiu's claim
that he and his wife have applied for U.S. citizenship.</P>
      <P>On Monday, Chen Chih-chung and his elder sister, Chen Hsin-yu,
also filed a defamation lawsuit against Chiu over Chiu's claim that
they own "huge assets" in the United States.</P>
      <P>Because the two cases were unrelated, Chen Chih-chung's lawyer
Hsu Ming-shui said they should be handled separately.</P>
      <P>If Chiu is indicted over the "citizenship" defamation suit, Hsu
said his client will demand NT$100 million in damages.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-chung has rebutted Chiu's "citizenship" claim in a
written statement, stressing that he has never applied for nor
possessed a passport of any country other than the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-chung further said he has never applied for immigration
through investment in the United States nor any other form of U.S.
immigration. He also sternly debunked Chiu's claim that he has
invested in a supermarket chain in the U.S.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THOUSANDS RALLY IN PANCHIAO TO OPPOSE PERSECUTION INSIDE CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Thousands of Taiwanese rallied in a parade
in Panchiao, Taipei County Saturday to oppose persecution in China
and voice support for a movement urging Chinese to withdraw
membership from the Communist Party of China (CPC).</P>
      <P>"In two years, almost 16 million Chinese people have submitted
statements withdrawing from the CPC or its affiliated organizations.
The numbers show the Chinese have spurned the CPC because of its
severe persecution inside China and repeated violations of human
rights," said Lee Ching-mei, a parade spokeswoman.</P>
      <P>During the rally, Falun Gong members carried out an exercise that
uses five meditations, and something the Chinese government
deems an illegal activity.</P>
      <P>The parade was the second time a massive Taiwan rally was
organized in support of the secession movement since Epochtimes, a
Falun Gong affiliation newspaper, published "Nine Commentaries on the
CPC" and launched the movement in 2004, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Braving the cold air and light rain, participants held
cardboard and banners with anti-CPC slogans, which included "CPC is
not China," "Oppose organ harvesting," "Support Chinese human rights
activists," and "A democratic China will not exist before the
elimination of the CPC."</P>
      <P>History shows in Russia, more than 4.2 million members withdrew
from the Communist Party before the Soviet Union finally collapsed in
1991. And the CPC may collapse as well, with the secession movement
gaining steam, said Li Dayong, who works for the Global Service
Center for Quitting CCP.</P>
      <P>Li said most people don't realize that behind all the rapid
economic growth and development of big cities, the Chinese government
has illegally kidnapped and detained dissidents, writers and
reporters, suppressed Falun Gong members, and ignored the problems of
corruption, discontinued education, unemployment and an ineffective
health care system, among many other areas.</P>

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung's mayoral candidates elaborated
their respective policies Saturday in televised campaign speeches
organized by the Central Election Commission.</P>
      <P>Chen Chu, candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) , promised to construct the country's first light-rail rapid
transit system (MRT) in Kaohsiung during her four-year tenure if
elected in the mayoral elections on Dec. 9.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen vowed to complete two MRT lines in Kaohsiung,
which are currently under construction; hold a successful World Games
in the southern port city in 2009; and complete construction on an
international convention and exhibition center in the city.</P>
      <P>Huang Chun-ying, the opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) candidate,
suggested the government open direct air and marine transport between
Kaohsiung and China, which he estimated would create trade
opportunities worth NT$10 billion for the city.</P>
      <P>Such a move is likely to draw Taiwanese business people back from
China, and foreign enterprises will want to set up their operational
headquarters in Kaohsiung, Huang claimed.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-ming, who is representing the Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) in the races, urged the public not to vote for those who are
not deeply involved in Kaohsiung affairs.</P>
      <P>Noting that he served as Kaohsiung city councilor for 12 years
before being elected legislator, Lo said he was the candidate who
best understands Kaohsiung's problems.</P>
      <P>Lin Chih-sheng, candidate for the Taiwan Defense Alliance (TDA),
noted that Taiwan's current political upheaval lies in its vague
national identity, and he promised, if elected, to work toward
defining Taiwan's position in the world community.</P>
      <P>Expressing his opposition to direct transport links with China,
Lin lamented that Taiwan's economy has suffered after some
politicians encouraged more investment in China. Lin urged the
Taiwanese people to build a truly independent country for their own
benefit.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Department of Health (DOH) held an
exercise against avian flu Saturday at a community college in Hsinyi
district, after a recent outbreak of the deadly H5N1 strain of avian
flu in poultry in neighboring South Korea.</P>
      <P>The bird flu outbreak in South Korea, whose government has
therefore ordered the immediate slaughter of some 300,000 chickens,
has caused concern in Taiwan, since the two countries are
geographically close and on the same migration route for migratory
birds, although Taiwan remains free of bird flu.</P>
      <P>The rehearsal, dubbed "White Egret No. 8, " focused on efforts to
minimize panic in the event of an avian flu outbreak.</P>
      <P>Chiu Chan-hsien, a section chief of the DOH's Center for Disease
Control (CDC) , noted that his agency has been cooperating with
community colleges around the country and National Cheng Kung

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As an emerging democracy, Taiwan should play
an active role in China's democratization for the benefit of both
people in Taiwan and China, a Chinese human rights activist said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>"Only by participating in the process of the democratization of
China and the deconstruction of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
can God truly bless Taiwan," said Li Dayong, who works for the Global
Service Center for Quitting CPC, on the sidelines of a parade
opposing state-led persecution inside China.</P>
      <P>The rally gathered thousands of participants in Panchiao, Taipei
County to support a movement calling on CPC members to quit the
party, and opposing China's suppression of Falun Gong and dissidents.</P>
      <P>Views of Taiwan's future commonly held among Taiwanese people --
unification, independence, and the status quo -- will not work
because they are all based on interaction between cross-strait
governments, Li said.</P>
      <P>"But can you really trust the Chinese government and the CPC,
based on its track record?" asked Li, who is one of the founders of
Future China Forum, a democracy-advocating Internet forum.</P>
      <P>Eastern European countries didn't start their democratization
process until the Communist Party of Soviet Union was deconstructed,
Li said, adding that it provided a perfect example for both Taiwan
and China.</P>
      <P>"Most people know that Taiwan is in a stalemate politically,
especially in cross-strait relations. The real question we have
to ask is how to walk out of it," he said.</P>
      <P>"In my opinion, only by helping Chinese people break away from
the control and suppression of the CPC can Taiwan secure its future
and break away from China's military threat," he said.</P>

      <P>A National Cheng Kung University (NCKU)

monitoring system, using global positioning system (GPS) signals, a
university spokesman reported Saturday.</P>
      <P>Tseng Ching-liang, director-general of NCKU's Satellite

"maritime remote-sensing system based on GPS reflective signal" --
can provide real-time information of water levels at rivers,

      <P>Tseng said that Germany already has such a system in place, but
it is the first of its kind in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>With funding from the National Science Council, the research team

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SEEKING INT'L PRESENCE VIA CULTURAL EXCHANGES: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday
Taiwan looks forward to expanding its international presence through
increased cultural exchanges with other countries.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in a speech delivered at a happy
get-together of foreign students studying at local universities or
graduate institutes on scholarships offered by the Republic of China
government.</P>
      <P>The get-together, organized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) , is aimed at fostering goodwill and friendship with Taiwan
scholarship recipients, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The MOFA began to offer scholarships in 2003 to encourage foreign
youths to pursue tertiary education in Taiwan as part of its efforts
to forge closer links with the international community through
cultural exchanges.</P>
      <P>The number of recipients of the MOFA-sponsored Taiwan
scholarships has reached about 500. This is the first time that the
MOFA has hosted a party for all scholarship recipient students to get
together for an evening of amusement and entertainment.</P>
      <P>Many foreign students performed their country's folm music and
dances at the evening party. Resident ambassadors and representatives
of various countries were also invited to attend the get-together.</P>
      <P>While geographic boundaries and political limitations tend to
exist among countries around the world, Chen said cultural exchanges
can be freely without any off-limits.</P>
      <P>"We believe that arts, music, dances and other cultural
activities can be the best vehicle for sharing feelings and aesthetic
experiences and forging international partnerships, " Chen said,
adding that such exchanges are also the best embodiment of Taiwan's
ideal of basing its national development on cultural heritage and
creativity.</P>
      <P>Noting that the robust development in creative cultural
industries in recent years has brought new opportunities for Taiwan
to expand its international presence, Chen said Taiwan has taken part
in a world-class historic relic restoration project in Guatemala
since 2005.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said, Taiwan has cooperated with the Institute
de France in presenting a culture award since 1996 and a
UNESCO-affiliated international theater association has relocated its
secretariat to Taiwan. To boost cultural exchanges with Russia, Chen
said, an exhibition of literary works and relevant archives and
artifacts of three great Russian writers is being held at the
National Museum of Literature in Tainan.</P>
      <P>"All these activities point to our commitment to promoting
cultural development and fulfill its duties as an Global Village
member in promoting world peace through cultural exchanges, " he

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT SETS HIGH GOAL FOR TAIWANESE IDENTITY PROMOTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday he is
hopeful that the percentage of local citizens identifying themselves
as Taiwanese rather than Chinese can reach 80 percent by the end of
his term of office on May 20, 2008.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while hosting a dinner at the Taipei Guest
House in honor of participants to the sixth World Taiwanese Congress
which opened in Taipei earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Before he assumed the presidency in May 2000, Chen said only 20
percent to 30 percent of local people identified themselves as
Taiwanese rather than Chinese. But the percentage already spiked to
60 percent in an opinion survey conducted by National Chengchi
University's Election Study Center last month.</P>
      <P>"Let's continue working together to promote Taiwan's
self-identity. Hopefully, the percentage of local people identifying
themselves as Taiwanese can hit 80 percent before the conclusion of
my tenure in 2008," Chen said.</P>
      <P>As normalization of Taiwan's statehood is the theme of this
year's World Taiwanese Congress, Chen told his guests that
Taiwan's recent political turmoil was rooted in difficulties in
normalizing Taiwan's statehood.</P>
      <P>"As a result, there is a polarized conflict over national
identity in our society. And our constitution is unfit and irrelevant
to our present national situation, which has in turn caused many
unfavorable and even harmful impact on our country's transformation
into a mature democracy," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen said he has consistently remained confident of
Taiwan's democratic future.</P>
      <P>"Over the past few months, some people have taken to the streets
or even resorted to drastic measures to make known their appeals...
However, our country has not paused or faltered over those vociferous
protests. The government has continued implemented various
policy initiatives, economic activities have remained on normal track
and the stock market has become even more robust. Our democratic
achievements and our people's democratic mannerism and
resilience deserve applause, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president was referring to a so-called "Million Voices
Against Corruption" campaign led Shih Ming-teh, a former chairman of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, to force him to resign over
a spate of corruption allegations implicating members of the first
family and his close aides.</P>
      <P>Chen has survived three opposition-initiated recall motions in
the legislature. On Nov. 3, prosecutors indicted the first lady, Wu
Shu-jen on charges of embezzling NT$14.8 million from a special
"state affairs fund" budgeted for the president's discretionary use,
and Chen could face the same charges when his immunity from
prosecution lapses after he leaves office in May 2008.</P>
      <P>The president has denied any wrongdoing, insisting that history
will return justice to him and judicial process will clear his name.
But he promised to step down if his wife is found guilty in the first
trial. The district court will open the first hearing on the case
Dec. 15.</P>
      <P>In his Saturday speech, Chen told participants to the Taiwanese
World Congress that freedom and rule of law are two of a kind and
that successful liberal societies tend to protect freedom with
consistent and impartial rule of law.</P>
      <P>"Now that Taiwan is a liberal democracy, we should abide by the
law and follow due process of law, including recalling a president
and rewriting the Constitution," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that crisis often offers opportunity for reform and
development, Chen said that despite the recent political
disturbances, he will never back off his promise of carrying out
constitutional re-engineering.</P>
      <P>"I'll do my utmost during the remainder of my term in office to
promote constitutional reform and craw up a constitutional system
that is fit and relevant to Taiwan's present status quo, " Chen said,
adding that glorifying Taiwan's national identity, defending its
sovereignty, dignity and security as well as warding off any change
to the peaceful status quo in the Taiwan Strait are his unshirkable
missions as the country's head of state.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SEEKING INT'L PRESENCE VIA CULTURAL EXCHANGES: PRESIDENT(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday
Taiwan looks forward to expanding its international presence through
increased cultural exchanges with other countries.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in a speech delivered at a happy
get-together of foreign students studying at local universities or
graduate institutes on scholarships offered by the Republic of China
government.</P>
      <P>The get-together, organized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) , is aimed at fostering goodwill and friendship with Taiwan
scholarship recipients, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The MOFA began to offer scholarships in 2003 to encourage foreign
youths to pursue tertiary education in Taiwan as part of its efforts
to forge closer links with the international community through
cultural exchanges.</P>
      <P>The number of recipients of the MOFA-sponsored Taiwan
scholarships has reached about 500. This is the first time that the
MOFA has hosted a party for all scholarship recipient students to get
together for an evening of amusement and entertainment.</P>
      <P>Many foreign students performed their country's folm music and
dances at the evening party. Resident ambassadors and representatives
of various countries were also invited to attend the get-together.</P>
      <P>While geographic boundaries and political limitations tend to
exist among countries around the world, Chen said cultural exchanges
can be freely without any off-limits.</P>
      <P>"We believe that arts, music, dances and other cultural
activities can be the best vehicle for sharing feelings and aesthetic
experiences and forging international partnerships, " Chen said,
adding that such exchanges are also the best embodiment of Taiwan's
ideal of basing its national development on cultural heritage and
creativity.</P>
      <P>Noting that the robust development in creative cultural
industries in recent years has brought new opportunities for Taiwan
to expand its international presence, Chen said Taiwan has taken part
in a world-class historic relic restoration project in Guatemala
since 2005.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said, Taiwan has cooperated with the Institute
de France in presenting a culture award since 1996 and a
UNESCO-affiliated international theater association has relocated its
secretariat to Taiwan. To boost cultural exchanges with Russia, Chen
said, an exhibition of literary works and relevant archives and
artifacts of three great Russian writers is being held at the
National Museum of Literature in Tainan.</P>
      <P>"All these activities point to our commitment to promoting
cultural development and fulfill its duties as an Global Village

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 3 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu declined Sunday to
speculate on how the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will
fare in next weekend's municipal elections in Taipei and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Lu said that she usually has a good intuition about which DPP
candidates will win but that she really has no idea about this year's
mayoral and city council elections to be held in Taipei in northern
Taiwan and Kaohsiung in the south Dec. 9.</P>
      <P>Lu made the comments while attending a campaign rally to stump
for Taipei City Council candidate Huang Hsiang-chun and mayoral
candidate Frank Hsieh.</P>
      <P>On the lower public interest in the elections compared to
previous elections, Lu said that this could be due to the fact that
Taiwan's democracy has become more mature, noting that it is natural
for voters in a mature democracy not to show as much enthusiasm as
voters in newly democratic countries.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lu criticized incumbent Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who
doubles as chairman of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , as "having
spent most of his time over the past eight years entertaining the
media by constantly changing his outfits instead of performing his
role as the mayor of Taiwan's capital."</P>
      <P>Noting that 12,500 of Taiwan's 85,000 low-income households are
located in Taipei City, Lu said that it is clear that having the KMT
run the municipal government has not been a blessing for Taipei
residents.</P>
      <P>Lu urged Taipei residents to vote for Frank Hsieh, who she said
has experience turning Kaohsiung City into a modern and beautiful
municipality during his time as mayor of the southern port city.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will
continue efforts to consolidate the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT
and the People First Party (PFP) to ensure a pan-blue victory in the
Dec. 9 mayoral election in Taipei, a KMT lawmaker said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chin-lung, a whip of the KMT legislative caucus, told
reporters that both KMT and PFP leaders are aware that most pan-blue
supporters want the two opposition parties to present only one
candidate in the election.</P>
      <P>Although the KMT has fielded the most hopeful candidate in the
race -- former Environmental Protection Administration Chief Hau
Lung-bin -- PFP Chairman James Soong is running as an independent,
raising concerns about a split pan-blue vote.</P>
      <P>The Taipei mayoral election is a six-way race that includes three
independent candidates. Polls over the past three months have shown
Hau leading all other candidates in voter approval ratings at above
40 percent.</P>
      <P>Soong's ratings have been between 8 percent and 11 percent, while
the ratings of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's candidate,
former Premier Frank Hsieh, have been between 15 percent and 20
percent.</P>
      <P>Pan-blue supporters have urged KMT and PFP leaders to sort out
their differences to ensure a pan-blue victory in the Taipei mayoral
election.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lai Shyh-bao said the leaders of the KMT and the
PFP both know the importance of consolidation within the "pan-blue
alliance" and that the question now is how to do it.</P>
      <P>Lai said the KMT will not cease its efforts in this regard to the
very end.</P>
      <P>In related news, media reports Sunday said KMT Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou had a secret meeting with his PFP counterpart for four
hours late Friday night in an attempt to thrash out their
differences.</P>
      <P>While a KMT spokesman declined to comment on the reports, PFP
Chairman Soong neither confirmed nor denied that the meeting took
place, saying only that news media should verify the report with

    <HEADLINE>TALKS ON TAIWAN-MACAU AVIATION PACT RENEWAL POSTPONED AGAIN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Review and negotiations on an aviation pact
between Taiwan and Macau were postponed once again last month,
marking the third postponement since 2005, officials said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Confirming the postponement, officials from the Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA) and the private Taipei Air Transport Business
Association (TATBA) said it is up to the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) to determine whether and when a meeting of air
carriers' representatives from Taiwan and Macau will be held to have
the pact renewed.</P>
      <P>Talks on Taiwan's flight rights with foreign countries are
usually handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but flight rights
talks between Taiwan and Hong Kong as well as Taiwan and Macau have
been handled by the MAC as such talks involve cross-Taiwan Strait
affairs.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan-Macau aviation pact was first signed by the TATBA and
Air Macau -- the territory's only airline -- on Nov. 30, 1995, with
the pact being in effect for five years and subject to further
alterations to adapt to the needs of both sides.</P>
      <P>MAC officials took part in the 2000 negotiations in their
capacity as TATBA consultants.</P>
      <P>The new round of pact renewal talks were originally scheduled to
be held in November 2005 but were postponed to May 30 this year.
However, as May 30 approached, the negotiators from the two sides
decided that the meeting should be postponed again.</P>
      <P>CAA Director-General Chang Kuo-cheng confirmed that he was
instructed by the MAC authorities recently to inform the Executive
Yuan that the Taiwan-Macau aviation pact review had been postponed
for a third time.</P>
      <P>TATBA Chairman Fan Chih-chiang also traveled to Macau recently
and reached a consensus with Air Macau officials on the postponement,
according to the TATBA authorities.</P>
      <P>Under the existing pact, passenger capacity on the Taipei-Macau
route was increased by 8,000 per week. Half of the additional
passenger capacity was allotted to Air Macau, and the other half was
divided between EVA Airways and TransAsia Airways -- the two Taiwan
carriers providing flight services on the route.</P>
      <P>Neither Chang nor Fan would confirm whether Taiwan plans to ask
in future talks for an increase in cargo volume for Taiwan carriers
and an inclusion of a Taichung-Macau route in the pact.</P>

      <P>Five social welfare groups in Taipei City
have sought to forge a " Love Front " and will hold a fundraising
charity evening party in the city Dec. 14 to help school dropouts, an

      <P>The " Love Front" is being formed by the Good Friend Mission

      <P>Chu said that according to the new rules concerning junior high
school students in Taipei City enacted by the city's Department of
Education, schools are allowed to suspend students " unamenable to
guidance " for two weeks. He said the five organizations are worried
that the stipulation will empower the schools to drop students
without informing the education authorities of their decisions.</P>
      <P>The fundraising dinner will take place at Fu Shiang Yuan
Restaurant at the Taipei City Council hall, Chu said, inviting the
public to join the charity activity. He added that the purchase of
just one ticket to the activity can help a dropout get back into

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Communication between the Kuomintang
(KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) has been frequent and smooth,
and there is no need for the two parties to hold a closed-door
meeting, KMT spokesman Huang Yu-chen said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Huang made the comments in this southern port city, where KMT
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou was stumping for the party's candidate, Huang
Chun-ying, in the Dec. 9 Kaohsiung mayoral election, after a
newspaper reported that Ma and PFP Chairman James Soong had met for
four hours in a closed-door meeting late Friday.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Ma and Soong, who is running as an
independent in the Dec. 9 Taipei mayoral election, discussed "put-out
mechanisms" and bilateral cooperation after the mayoral and city
council elections in Taipei and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Huang refuted the report and stressed that no
such meeting took place between the chairmen of
the KMT and the PFP -- which together form the
opposition "pan-blue alliance."</P>
      <P>"As Soong seems determined to run until the
end in the Taipei mayoral race, it is impossible
for the KMT to ask him to withdraw from the race
now," Huang said.</P>
      <P>"The two parties are engaged in a gentlemen's race and they will
not make any deal in exchange for Soong's withdrawal from the Taipei
mayoral election," he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Soong was reluctant to respond to
reporters' questions about the issue, only
reiterating that the PFP stands firm in its
position of cooperating with the KMT.</P>
      <P>According to Soong, he has no idea how news
of a meeting came out.</P>
      <P>"If elected mayor of Taipei, I promise to do my best to serve
Taipei citizens and support the KMT to win back power in the 2008
presidential election," Soong said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hau Lung-bin, the KMT candidate
in the coming Saturday's Taipei mayoral
election, expressed his strong belief that he
will win the contest as Ma is fully supportive
of him.</P>
      <P>Many pan-blue supporters are concerned that Soong and Hau might
split the pan-blue vote, thus paving the way for
victory by former Premier Frank Hsieh -- the
candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Tzu Chi Bone Marrow and Stem Cell
Research Center, the largest of its kind in Asia, has linked up with
its two largest counterparts in the world -- which are located in the
United States and Germany, respectively -- to better serve blood
disease patients globally, an official of the center said Sunday.</P>
      <P>After linking up with the U.S. national bone marrow program,
which ranks as the largest in the world with the data of six million
donors, and the German bone marrow bank, which is the world's second
largest with the data of some three million donors, the Tzu Chi Bone
Marrow and Stem Cell Research Center now has access to over 10
million donors' data worldwide and is in turn contributing to forming
a much larger bone marrow databank to help blood disease patients,
the Tzu Chi official said.</P>
      <P>Bone marrow transplant is currently the most effective treatment
for blood diseases like leukemia and serious anemia.</P>
      <P>The Tzu Chi Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Research Center -- a
subsidiary of the Buddhist Compassionate Relief Tzu Chi Foundation
founded by Master Sheng Yen -- now boasts 290,000 samples, the Tzu
Chi official said.</P>
      <P>The center currently runs five departments: an immunogenetics
laboratory, an umbilical cord blood bank, a clinical medicine
research department, a donor activity and outreach department, and a
database and administrative department.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Sales of completed homes in Taiwan in
November increased 29.8 percent in value over the same month last
year, according to statistics released Sunday by Sinyi Real Estate
Inc., Taiwan's largest housing agent.</P>
      <P>Chang Hsin-min, an assistant manager at Sinyi's planning and
research division, noted that the November sales of completed homes
also rose 14.2 percent in value over October.</P>
      <P>Chang explained that in terms of the number of transactions, the
November sales were up only 1.4 percent from the same month in 2005
and 4.6 percent from October.</P>
      <P>This is due to the fact that the average price of a completed
home sold in November went up by 9.1 percent to up about NT$9.43
million, compared with the average price in October, he added.</P>
      <P>Chang predicted that sales of completed homes in December will
continue to be brisk as a result of seasonal factors. He explained
that many young people like to get married before ushering in the new
year, creating a new wave of home buyers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMICS OFFICIAL FORECASTS TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC GROWTH AT 4.5% FOR 2007</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  3  (CNA)
(By Y.L.Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) official disclosed Sunday that the council
forecasts Taiwan's economic growth for 2007 will exceed 4.5 percent,
higher than the forecasts made by several major economic think tanks.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level council will hold a meeting to discuss the
forecast Monday before revealing it as part of the council's views
about Taiwan's economic outlook, the official said.</P>
      <P>A forecast of 4.5 percent is higher than the International
Monetary Fund's forecast of 4.2 percent, the Directorate-General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics' figure of 4.14 percent, the Chung
Hua Institution for Economic Research's forecast of 4.14 percent, the
Asian Development Bank's prediction of 4 percent growth, and Global
Insight's figure of 3.6 percent.</P>
      <P>Global Insight's growth forecast for the global economy for 2007
is 3.3 percent, with the economies of Taiwan's main export markets
slowing down. The xxxx forecasts that China's growth will drop from
10.5 percent this year to 9.2 percent in 2007, while the United
States' will decline from 3.3 percent to 2.4 percent, and Japan's
will slide from 2.5 percent to 2.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the council's forecast is relatively optimistic in
the face of decreasing foreign trade and declining consumption, the
official noted the Executive Yuan will put forth a set of five
projects to boost the economy, with the first part to be launched
next year, which he said should help allay relevant concerns.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>People in Taiwan will be able to see one
partial solar eclipse and two total lunar eclipses in 2007, plus a
number of meteor showers, according to the Astronomical Observatory
of the Central Weather Bureau (CWB).</P>
      <P>Information provided by the observatory shows that people in
Taiwan will be able to see the whole process of the partial solar
eclipse on March 19, and part of the processes of the two total lunar
eclipses on March 4 and Aug. 28.</P>
      <P>The observatory also indicated that Taiwan will be an ideal place
to watch meteor showers next year, with most of these celestial
events concentrated in the second half of the year.</P>
      <P>Among these meteor showers, the one radiating from the
constellation Perseus on the night of Aug. 13 and those streaming
from the constellation Gemini Dec. 14-15 will be the most worth
watching.</P>
      <P>Other meteor showers visible to people in Taiwan next year
include: the Lyrid meteor shower, flowing from the constellation
Lyra, on the night of April 23, the Aquarid meteor shower July 28,
the Orionid meteor shower Oct. 21, and the Leonid meteor shower on
Dec. 18.</P>
      <P>A meteor shower occurs when large amounts of small fragments from
cosmic debris enter the Earth's atmosphere at extremely high speed
within a short period of time, leaving a streak of light that
disappears quickly.</P>
      <P>Most of the cosmic debris fragments are smaller than a grain of
sand, so almost all the fragments burn up in the atmosphere and never
reach the Earth's surface.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'LOVE FOR KAOHSIUNG AND TAIWAN' RALLY STAGED IN KAOHSIUNG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,   Dec.   3  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A rally organized by a dozen
pro-independence groups led by the Taiwan Society to "show love for
the island" was staged in Kaohsiung City in southern Taiwan Sunday
evening, bringing together almost all Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) leaders.</P>
      <P>The participants, mainly followers of the ruling DPP, began
streaming into the venue of the rally along the banks of the Love
River between the Kaohsiung Bridge and Chungcheng Bridge in downtown
Kaohsiung. By 5: 20 p.m. when the rally formally began, some 100,000
people had already gathered, according to the organizers.</P>
      <P>In addition to President Chen Shui-bian, also attending were Vice
President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang, DPP Chairman Yu
Shyi-kun and President Chen's son, Chen Chih-chung, who returned from
New York with his pregnant wife Friday night to preempt critics'
claims that they were planning to have their first child born in the
United States in order to get U.S. citizenship for their child.</P>
      <P>Frank Hsieh, DPP's mayoral candidate in Taipei City who had
served as the Kaohsiung mayor between 1998 and 2005 also appeard at
the site on 7 p.m.</P>
      <P>At the request of the master of ceremony, the participants in the
rally joined their hands to form a human chain of three to four
persons deep along the river "to show their love for the river, the
city and the island," according the organizers.</P>
      <P>Although the rally was aimed at allowing people to show their
love for Taiwan, almost all the speakers at the gathering showered
praise on the ruling party, which has controlled the Kaohsiung city
hall for the last eight years, for cleaning up the Love Rive and
stumped votes for the party's mayoral candidate, Chen Chu.</P>
      <P>President Chen and Vice President Lu flashed the figure five,
referring to Chen Chu's ballot number, repeatedly during their
speeches, to woo support for the ruling party's candidate.</P>
      <P>They also railed against the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , whose
candidate, Huang Chun-ying, is engaged in a neck-and-neck race with
Chen Chu.</P>
      <P>Chen Chu was invited to make a speech at the rally, during which
she blamed the KMT for turning the Love River into a "dirty ditch"
during its five decades in power in the city.
She said the DPP, since coming to power in the city eight years ago,
has cleaned up the river and expanded the city's sewage system.</P>
      <P>She appealed to the people at the rally to keep the DPP in power
in Kaohsiung by voting for her in the election.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, four Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) candidates in the
city council elections showed up at the rally despite the TSU's
prohibiting any of the party's candidates from attending the
gathering.</P>
      <P>Chao Tien-lin, one of the four TSU candidates, said they just
came to greet the people at the rally, and not to endorse Chen Chu's
bid for the mayorship.</P>
      <P>The TSU, an ally of the DPP in the Legislative Yuan, prohibited
its candidates from attending the rally because the rally's
organizers had tried to persuade TSU mayoral candidate Lo Chih-ming
to withdraw from the race and to rally behind Chen Chu.</P>
      <P>KMT candidate Huang Chun-ying didn't bother to attend the rally,
claiming that the rally had been converted into a campaign rally for
Chen Chu and that the DPP was trying to claim all the credit for
cleaning up the river, even though the project to clean up the
river started long before the DPP came to power in
Kaohsung.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WILL CONTRIBUTE MORE IF PART OF WHO ACTIVITIES: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that
Taiwan will make a greater contribution to the world's health efforts
if it is allowed to take part in more activities under the World
Health Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>Chen said that although Taiwan is not a WHO member or observer,
the country has upheld the universal principle of health rights and
has made a contribution in line with the WHO's goals of "helping the
poor and the weak."</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of the International Forum for Health
Leaders held at the International Convention Center of the National
Taiwan University Hospital, Chen said despite Taiwan's being expelled
from the WHO in 1972 after the United Nations granted the China seat
at the U.N. to the People's Republic of China, Taiwan has never
relented in its efforts to participate in or push for global health
endeavors.</P>
      <P>Over the past 10 years in particular, Taiwan health authorities
have surmounted various difficulties to implement a national health
insurance program to cover virtually everyone in the country, Chen
said. At the same time, he added, Taiwan has also actively taken part
in international medical aid actions abroad, winning the hearts and
minds of people around the world.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's medical aid and first-aid personnel have taken part in
major natural disaster relief efforts worldwide in recent years,
including following the devastating tsunamis that struck South and
Southeast Asia in late December 2004, and the major earthquakes that
rocked Central Asia in 2005, the president said.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan has contributed to efforts to arrest the
spread of polio in Gambia, control HIV/AIDS in Malawi, expand medical
facilities in Swaziland, and control the spread of malaria and
cholera in Sao Tome and Principe.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen offered his congratulations to Hong Kong bird flu
expert Dr. Margaret Chan, who was officially appointed by the WHO in
early November as the new WHO chief. He told Chan that Taiwan is more
than willing to contribute efforts to support the new programs in six
health areas that Chan is planning to promote worldwide.</P>
      <P>Chen also called for the health leaders from around the world
attending the meeting to strive harder in dealing with various major
health issues, particularly suicide, obesity, chronic disease, drug
abuse and seniors' care to help improve the well-being of people
around the world.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEFENSE MINISTER REFUSES TO RELEASE MILITARY INSTRUCTOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Defense Minister Lee Jye refused Monday to
accede to opposition lawmakers' demands that the high school
drillmaster detained on the charge of inciting "active duty
servicemen to riot" in late November be released.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan Defense Committee, Lee
said the case -- involving Army Maj. Tung Hua-cheng, a drillmaster at
the Taibei High School in Shilin, who showed up Sept. 20 at the site
of a "Million Voices Against Corruption" rally aimed at pushing for
President Chen Shui-bian to step down -- is being handled by the
military courts according to the law.</P>
      <P>Tung wore his military uniform to the rally but apparently was
trying to hide his identity with a face mask and a pair of
sunglasses. At the rally, he displayed a letter he wrote to Minister
of National Defense Lee Jye, saying that in the event of a war, the
rank and file soldiers will "turn their guns inward."</P>
      <P>The military instructor could face seven years in prison if
convicted of inciting active duty servicemen to riot in violation of
Article 16 of the Criminal Law of the Armed Forces, according to
Military High Court prosecutors.</P>
      <P>Noting that Tung is facing serious charges, Lee said that he
cannot agree with the opposition lawmakers' calls for his release. He
added that if lawmakers feel that Tung's human rights have been
violated, they can file a petition with the commission charged to
protect servicemen's rights under the Ministry of National Defense
(MND).</P>
      <P>Opposition People First Party Legislator Chao Liang-yen asked the
MND to release Tung immediately, claiming that military prosecutors
had "illegally arrested" him. Chao argued that the offense of
inciting active duty servicemen to riot only applies to actions that
endanger the integrity of the nation's territory, are aimed at
toppling the government, or involve the use of violence to threaten
or coerce.</P>
      <P>Chao argued that Tung did not commit any of these offenses
through his actions at the rally.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee said that he has not felt any pressure from
"upstairs" since the officer's arrest and that the military has
remained calm, with no signs that any "rank and file soldiers have
been incited to riot."</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO REVIEW TOURIST BUS SAFETY REGULATIONS: MOTC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Transportation authorities have begun a
comprehensive review of existing measures and regulations concerning
tourist bus-related traffic safety after a bus accident claimed 21
lives in southern Taiwan Sunday.</P>
      <P>Minister of Transportation and Communications Tsai Duei said
Monday at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting that the ministry is
working to impose stricter restrictions on the maximum age of
passenger buses and considering banning the use of retread tires on
tourist buses. </P>
      <P>A bus carrying a group of local tourists from Kaohsiung to Tainan
plunged into a ravine near the Meiling Scenic Area in Nansi in Tainan
County, Sunday, killing 21 and injuring all others on board.</P>
      <P>The accident has been called by authorities the country's worst
highway accident in 20 years.</P>
      <P>A preliminary investigation has revealed that the bus was 18
years old and fitted with retread tires.</P>
      <P>Although the use of retreads is not prohibited, most officials of
the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) believe it's
time to upgrade measures in the management of retreads, with some
suggesting banning tourist buses from using the tires, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Faced with lawmakers' concerns, Tsai also said efforts have been
launched to screen all "risky roads" for sightseeing buses around the
island. The ministry is scheduled to publicize a list of the roads
within three months in an attempt to prevent a similar tragedy from
occurring in the future.</P>
      <P>According to MOTC statistics, there are a total of 11,925 tourist
buses in Taiwan, 3,339 of which are over 12 years old.</P>
      <P>In early October, a bus carrying 19 Chinese tourists plunged from
a mountain road into a valley in the central county of Nantou,
killing six people.</P>
      <P>In light of the fact that the drivers of the buses in these two
accidents had both had their bus licenses for less than three years,
Tsai said the MOTC will begin in January of next year to activate a
reporting system on the management of bus drivers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FREE FLU SHOTS AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE AGED OVER 50</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>From Dec. 1, a government-funded flu
vaccination program will be further expanded to cover citizens aged
50 or over, officials from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) under
the Department of Health said Monday.</P>
      <P>Citizens aged 50 or over are urged to get free flu shots at
public hospitals as soon as possible, since the vaccination rate this
year has been low and the stock of flu vaccine doses remains high,
said Liu Ting-ping, director of the CDC Vaccine Center.</P>
      <P>Liu said that since the government started providing 2.24 million
free flu vaccinations for the public Sept. 25 in preparation for the
winter flu season, only about half of the people eligible for free
vaccinations had received shots as of mid-November.</P>
      <P>A study conducted by the CDC among 200,000 people vaccinated
against the flu between 2003 and 2004 indicates that the ratio of
hospitalization for pneumonia or influenza among those who received
the shots was 40 percent lower than the ratio for those who were not
vaccinated, while the risk of hospitalization for chronic respiratory
diseases was 24 percent lower, they noted.</P>
      <P>The CDC, after analyzing reported flu cases between 2000 and
2006, said the incidence of flu turning into serious disease among
children under 12 years is four or five times the number among people
over 65, while the mortality rate is also three of four times that of
the elderly, far higher than other age groups.</P>
      <P>Liu said Taiwan usually enters flu season around the end of
November, with cases reaching a peak around Christmas.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, the best way to prevent flu is to get flu
shots.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS FAIL TO AGREE ON EASING CAP ON INVESTMENT IN CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling and opposition parties bickered
heatedly Monday at a legislative committee meeting over a draft
statute revision to ease a 40-percent ceiling on investment in China.</P>
      <P>With the views so diverse, Non-Partisan Solidarity Union
Legislator Tsai Hao, who chaired the meeting, had tried in
vain to smooth out the differences and had to leave the matter for
later discussion.</P>
      <P>At issue is the statute revision proposed by Legislator
Lai Shyh-bao of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and 37 colleagues
from the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People
First Party. The lawmakers said the government's "active management,
effective opening" policy regarding cross-Taiwan Strait trade runs
counter to the principle of market forces and restricts the
investment strategy of Taiwan businessmen.</P>
      <P>Lai proposed that Taiwan businessmen only report their investment
projects in China to the Ministry of Economic Affairs after six months
and that the cap on investment should be eased.</P>
      <P>He urged that investment projects in China be seen as general
investment or cooperation projects without the requirement of prior
approval.</P>
      <P>Also, local businesses that have paid-in capital of NT$80
million (US$3.42 million) and a net worth of over NT$10 billion
should have their investment cap for investment in China eased from
the present 40 percent to 50 percent.</P>
      <P>But Legislator Chao Yung-ching of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and Legislator David Huang of the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) opposed to the change vehemently, claiming
that it would "hollow out" Taiwan's economy.</P>

(MND) will ask the Executive Yuan to sponsor negotiations between the
MND and the Ministry of Education (MOE) on the matter, Defense
Minister Lee Jye said Monday.</P>
      <P>Answering a question from opposition Kuomintang Legislator Kuo
Su-chun on whether it is true that all drillmasters on campuses will
be phased out by 2020 as noted recently by Education Minister Tu
Cheng-sheng, Lee said Tu spelled out his ideas without consulting him
in advance and that he had not discussed the issue with Tu.</P>
      <P>Lee said the MND has pondered the necessity of posting
drillmasters on college campuses but feels it is still necessary to
post drillmasters in senior high schools to help "bolster the
students' character education, provide counseling for students and
maintain campus order and security."</P>
      <P>Admitting, however, that the drillmaster system needs to be
improved, Lee said the MND thinks that before military instructors
are pulled off campuses once and for all, their quality should at
least be upgraded. For example, he said, drillmasters should be asked
to return to the military rank and file after working on college
campuses or in high schools for two years in a bid to provide schools
with the "best possible military and character education."</P>
      <P>The drillmasters issue became a focus of attention Monday at the
Legislative Yuan Defense Committee after Maj. Tung Hua-cheng, a
drillmaster at the Taibei High School in Shilin, who attended a Sept.
20 "Million Voices Against Corruption" rally aimed at pushing for
President Chen Shui-bian's ouster, was detained on the charge of
inciting "active duty servicemen to riot" in late November.</P>
      <P>At the rally, Tung allegedly displayed a letter he wrote to Lee,
saying that in the event of a war, the army will "turn their guns
inward." Tung could face seven years in prison if convicted of
inciting active duty servicemen to riot in violation of Article 16 of
the Criminal Law of the Armed Forces, according to Military High
Court prosecutors.</P>
      <P>Tu said recently that vacancies left by retiring drillmasters
will be no longer be filled, with the goal of phasing out military
officers on campuses by
2020.</P>
      <P>Tu said universities should make courageous reforms now that the
function of drillmasters "has been completed."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the job of military officers should be to
defend the country rather than provide psychological counseling to
children and said the job will be taken over by professionals.</P>
      <P>According to MOE tallies, there are 1,420 drillmasters in
universities and colleges around the country, approximately
three-fifths of whom will have retired by 2014, with all of them gone
by 2020.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOJ CLARIFIES FIRST EXECUTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) clarified
Monday that the first approved execution this year is not the one
reported by a local newspaper.</P>
      <P>Vice Justice Minister Lee Chin-yung was responding to a report
carried by the United Daily News that Justice Minister Shih Mao-lin
had approved the execution of Tseng Su-jui, who murdered a senior
high school teacher after breaking into her residence in 2002.</P>
      <P>Reports also said that after Shih approved the execution order,
the High Prosecutor's Office should carry out the order within three
days.</P>
      <P>Lee said the ministry has adopted a very cautious attitude toward
execution and has indeed approved an execution, although not Tseng's
case.</P>
      <P>Lee said lawyers have requested an investigation of the case to
see about the possibility of filing an extraordinary appeal.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that for all capital cases, the ministry will say
clearly whether there is a possibility of an extraordinary
appeal or retrial.</P>
      <P>"The ministry will only cautiously consider approving an
execution after all means are exhausted and there is still no chance
of starting a retrial or filing an extraordinary appeal," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Taiwan will repeal the death sentence, Lee said it
is a long-term goal for a nation founded on human rights.</P>
      <P>He said the public have polarized views on scrapping the death
penalty, adding that the matter will need long-term communications
and campaigning to reach a consensus.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The proposed formation of a new form of
"political alliance" between the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and
the People First Party (PFP) should wait until after the Dec. 9
elections in Taipei and Kaohsiung cities have finished, a KMT
lawmaker said Monday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chin-lung, the KMT's whip at the Legislative Yuan, made the
comments in response to speculation that KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
and PFP Chairman James Soong have met to discuss "pullout mechanisms"
as the mayoral and city council elections are to be held Saturday in
the two special municipalities.</P>
      <P>According to a China Times report, Ma and Soong met in a
closed-door meeting late Friday to discuss Soong's withdrawal from
the Taipei mayoral election in order to secure victory for Hau
Lung-bin, the KMT's candidate in the race.</P>
      <P>Soong might announce his pullout from the Taipei mayoral
election, in which he is running as an independent, at the last
minute and urge voters to cast their ballots for Hau, the report
said, adding that in turn, the KMT agreed to allow Soong to serve as
convener of a proposed KMT-PFP alliance -- a different one to the
existing "pan-blue alliance" -- and to continue bi-partisan
cooperation at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Tsai denied the report and argued that it is impossible for the
two parties to exchange such terms with only five days left to go
before the elections.</P>
      <P>Ma did not discuss election issues with Soong and there is
absolutely no deal between them on the pullout issue, Tsai claimed,
adding that "the KMT won't do anything that could affect the
elections now."</P>
      <P>As to rampant speculation about the establishment of a new formal
KMT-PFP political alliance, Tsai made it clear that "the KMT does not
plan to do so at present" and that "it is better to talk about the
matter after the Dec. 9 elections" as the KMT and the PFP have always
been cooperative partners at the Legislative Yuan.</P>

      <P>A hospital in the central city of Taichung

nutritional and naturopathic therapy.</P>
      <P>Liu Po-jen, director of the Ear, Nose and Throat Department at

the therapy program is a joint effort between the hospital and
Hungkuang University's Graduate School of Nutritional Medicine.</P>

and an initial group of 15 volunteers who have accepted the therapy
have shown satisfactory results, Liu said.</P>
      <P>The hospital will recruit 15 more volunteers with asthma who will
receive a free two-month course of treatment with nutrients known to

      <P>Health leaders from more than 40 countries
met in a global forum in Taipei Monday to discuss health

it would be able to make a greater contribution to global health if
it were allowed to take part in more WHO activities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FREEWAY TRAFFIC POLICE TO STEP UP CRACKDOWN ON HARD SHOULDER DRIVING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Traffic police will step up a crackdown on
the practice of using the hard shoulder of freeways to overtake,
Taiwan National Freeway Bureau officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials said that according to newly revised
regulations, the fines for using the hard shoulder in violation of
the traffic regulations will be between NT$3,000 and NT$6,000
(US$90.9-US$181.8).</P>
      <P>It took a car accident involving Taichung Mayor Jason Hu and his
wife Shao Hsiao-ling Nov. 18 to goad the police into making the move.
Hu's minivan overturned when a vehicle tried to overtake it on the
hard shoulder as he was returning to Taichung after campaign stumping
in Kaohsiung. Shao, who had to have her left arm amputated and her
spleen removed, was still unconscious at the Chi Mei Medical Center
in Liuying, Tainan County.</P>
      <P>The officials said past freeway crackdowns have focused on
speeding, but tallies by freeway traffic police show that hard
shoulder driving in violation of traffic regulations account for
between 2,000 and 7,000 cases per month, representing between 3
percent and 7 percent of all violations.</P>
      <P>As these violations have a great impact on traffic safety, police
will from now on focus on speeding, not keeping a safe distance,
driving on the hard shoulder without legitimate reasons and changing
lanes recklessly, the officials said.</P>
      <P>They noted that the hard shoulders of the freeways are for use
only under special circumstances or during the execution of official
duties or rescue operations by ambulances, police cars and other
official vehicles.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the director of the intensive care unit at the Chi Mei
Medical center, said Shao's Glasgow coma scale has improved to 11
from two when she arrived at the hospital, and added that if her
condition remains stable for the next one or two weeks, Hu might be
able to consider transferring his wife to a hospital closer to their
home in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Dr. Hou Ching-cheng said that apart from her naso-gastric feeding
tube, she no longer relies on her life-support system.</P>
      <P>Shao can now make a little sounds and react to pain. Her medical
team will continue to give her stimuli to awaken her senses of smell,
hearing, vision and touch, in the hope of efficiently upgrading her
brain function.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 4 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu announced Monday
plans to open free evening classes for grade school children from
underprivileged families in every village across the country.</P>
      <P>Lu made the pledge during a speech at an informal meeting at the
Presidential Office, attended by representatives of more than 20 
village and township chiefs across the country.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the move would be an activity whose scope goes
beyond political differences, Lu said she will ask Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, a member of the main opposition Kuomintang, to
jointly promote the cause.</P>
      <P>Lu also called on widespread support for the campaign, saying it
is an initiative far more important to society as a whole than
election campaigns.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, the program aims to open more than 1,000
after-school auxiliary classes in 2007, with the first 100 beginning
during the coming winter vocation for children from low-income,
single parent or poor aboriginal families.</P>
      <P>Getting an adequate education is key for impoverished children to
overcome the effects of poverty, and the planned extra night classes
aim to provide them with a public and therefore free opportunity to
study and learn more.</P>
      <P>She called on private or public authorities to offer free sites
for the classes and urged retired schoolteachers, public servants and
college students to serve as hourly-paid instructors.</P>
      <P>Each class will comprise no more than 20 children and receive
monetary assistance of NT$100,000 per semester, she explained.</P>
      <P>Charitable organizations, such as the Rotary International Club,
Kiwanis International and local women's rights groups have promised
to raise funds for the campaign -- about NT$200 million (US$6.15
million) for the first year, Lu said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the vice president said, she is also projecting the
construction of residential communities for the silver-haired
population. As Taiwan's population is rapidly aging, it is a matter
worth very close attention, she added.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Monday he has
ordered the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) to
form a special task force to identify problems in traffic management
in the wake of a tragic bus accident that claimed 21 lives a day
earlier.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks to a group of local reporters after
delivering a speech at a dinner in honor of public health leaders
from more than 40 countries who were in Taipei to attend a forum on
disease prevention and health promotion.</P>
      <P>Noting that Sunday's bus crash has provided a heart-rending
lesson, Su said he wants the MOTC to determine problems in the design
and construction of the country's highways, as well as tour bus
management.</P>
      <P>"We will be able to avert a recurrence of similar tragedies
only after we get a clear picture of problems with all those
points," Su said, adding that he has demanded the MOTC assume the
responsibility of resolving all relevant issues.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, President Chen Shui-bian visited three
hospitals in Tainan County to express concern and sympathy for
those injured in the bus crash on the way to the mountainous 
Meiling Scenic Area in southern Tainan County.</P>
      <P>Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-chih presented a
package of recommendations to Chen on ways to improve
traffic management, including tightening supervision of the tour
bus industry and working out clear regulations on replacing aged
vehicles.</P>
      <P>The double-decker tour bus, with parents and students onboard
from Tingchin Elementary School in Kaohsiung City, tumbled
into a ravine Sunday as it wound its way down the mountain road
after stopping in Meiling, Tainan County. Twenty-one people died on
spot or on the way to hospitals, with 24 others seriously
injured.</P>
      <P>The injured, including 16 children, were treated for broken
bones and other injuries, a spokesman for the Kaohsiung city
government said.</P>
      <P>MOTC Minister Tsai Duei said the tour bus was 18 years
old but had recently passed a safety inspection. Authorities will
consider lawmakers' demands to restrict older buses from driving on
mountainous roads, Tsai told lawmakers Monday.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Lin Chih-feng said the cause of the accident was
still being investigated.</P>

Motse's lesson of the day: "When the administration of the ruler
answers to the desire of the subjects, it manifests an understanding
of approvals and disapprovals of the people. When there is such an
understanding, the good will be discovered and rewarded and the bad
will be discovered and punished, and the country will surely attain
order."</TEXT>

his role in a scandal related to Chinatrust's flawed investment in a

transactions in an attempt to acquire larger rival Mega Financial
Holding Co.</P>
      <P>Koo's current whereabouts are unknown. He failed to return to
Taiwan in November at the end of a two-month Eisenhower Fellowship
program in the United States.</P>
      <P>The wanted list will remain valid for more than 25 years and will
not expire until March 27, 2031.</P>

      <P>Chuang, former deputy superintendent of NTU Hospital who
specialized in immunology, began his research on AIDS after the first
imported case of AIDS was detected in Taiwan in 1984. He also served
for many years as the convener of an AIDS consultative commission
under the Department of Health (DOH).</P>
      <P>Chuang also served as a goodwill ambassador for the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, performing many difficult surgeries in Libya and
winning the respect of the Libyan people and government. Libyan
strongman Muammar el-Qaddafi is said to have been close friends with
him.</P>
      <P>At Chuang's urging, NTU hospital set up an AIDS research center
after obtaining funds from the DOH. The hospital also set up Taiwan's 
first ward for AIDS patients, who faced serious discrimination in
society at the time.</P>
      <P>He also contributed a great deal to the cocktail therapy for AIDs
patients project launched by the DOH in 1997.</P>
      <P>Chuang began cutting down on research work around five years ago
when he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease. Later, he was

Presidential Office on whether there will be a special envoy from
Taiwan attending the Gambian president's inauguration. Whether Lu
will represent President Chen remains uncertain, he added.</P>
      <P>Lee also noted that President Chen has said that the vice
president will visit Burkina Faso and that the ministry is making the
relevant arrangements.</P>
      <P>Lu's office said recently in a statement that she definitely
plans to visit Burkina Faso, but the timing of her visit has yet to
be finalized.</P>
      <P>The office issued the statement after reports said that Lu had
declined to make the visit because she plans to attend a conference
of the Democratic Pacific Union (DPU) scheduled for Dec. 8-10 in
Taipei. The DPU, inaugurated in August 2005, is the vice president's
brainchild.</P>
      <P>Lu's office said that after the conference, Lu will receive
delegates from various countries and that since the delegates will be
leaving Taiwan Dec. 11-12, Lu will be preoccupied and unable to leave
Taiwan during that two-day period.</P>
      <P>Her office also said that after the DPU conference, the Chinese
version of the vice president's biography, penned by a scriptwriter
of the popular South Korean TV drama "Dae Jang Geum, " will be
launched in Taipei.</P>
      <P>As Lu will attend the promotion for the new book, which will come
after Dec. 20, her African visit will probably take place after that
date, her office added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POOR WATER QUALITY AT GUEST HOUSES: EPA SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 5 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Guest houses had the poorest water quality
among major public or private establishments across Taiwan, according
to the results of a probe published Tuesday by the Cabinet-level
Environment Protection Administration (EPA).</P>
      <P>Among more than 1,200 residential communities, schools,
hospitals, department stores, bus or train transfer centers and
tourist spots investigated, water quality at guest houses, in
particular those on offshore islands, were found to be the country's
poorest, the EPA survey found.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-ming, a section chief at the EPA's Environmental
Sanitation and Toxic Chemicals Control Bureau, said that most
homestays and hotels with low water quality are located in remote
areas and that their water supplies mainly depend on underground
water or water towers that are rarely cleaned and may contain too
much bacteria.</P>
      <P>After random checks by EPA officials of cisterns and water towers
at 235 guest houses and hotels across the country, nearly 7 percent
of them had substandard water quality -- the highest level recorded
among all facilities, the survey discovered.</P>
      <P>Hospitals and tourist facilities came second and third with 5.7
percent and 5.6 percent, respectively, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>In terms of cities and counties, guest houses and hotels on the
Matsu Islands group under the jurisdiction of Lienchiang county
registered the highest level of substandard water quality -- around
40 percent, followed by those in central Taichung county with 26.3
percent. Around 8 percent of those on the offshore Penghu county and
some 6 percent in Kaohsiung city had unclean water.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, homestays and hotels with substandard water
quality have been required to improve the quality of their water
supply and meet conditions set by the government.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Q3 CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IN HOUSING PRICES DOWN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Consumer confidence in housing prices
decreased in the third quarter of 2006, indicating Taiwan's housing
market is losing steam owing to weak demand, according to a report
released Tuesday by the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD).</P>
      <P>The composite housing price confidence index stood at 102.48 in
the third quarter, down 5.52 points from the previous quarter and up
0.88 points over the same time last year, the report shows.</P>
      <P>The confidence index for housing prices in the near term
registered 107.56, down 4.43 points from the second quarter, while
the confidence index for housing prices in the future dropped 6.6
points to stand at 97.4.</P>
      <P>On the financial burden on homebuyers, the report indicates that
the average housing prices in Taiwan in the third quarter were equal
to 6.5 times the average annual income of local people.</P>
      <P>In Taipei City, the average housing prices in the third quarter
were equal to eight times the average annual income of its residents,
compared with the ratio of 8.7 times in the second quarter and 9.5
times in the first quarter.</P>
      <P>In the third quarter, homebuyers in the city spent an average
37.1 percent of their earnings on mortgage loans every month,
according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Chang Chin-o, a professor at National Chengchi University's
Department of Land Economics, said the result indicates that real
estate prices in Taipei City remain unreasonably high.</P>
      <P>Citing the examples of other countries, Chang noted that housing
prices are considered reasonable if they are equal to four to five
times the average annual income of the people, with spending on
mortgage loans accounting for one-quarter to one-third of their
earnings.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang warned the increase in the number of speculators
is a major factor for instability in Taiwan's housing market, and
urged the financial sector to screen mortgage loan applications with
discretion to stop manipulation of housing prices by speculators.</P>
      <P>The CEPD report indicates the ratio of first-time housing buyers
looking for residences for themselves declined to 49.6 percent in the
third quarter, the lowest level recorded so far this year.</P>
      <P>While the ratio of homebuyers who were replacing their old
residences for new ones increased to 26.3 percent, the ratio of those
buying houses for investment purposes rose to 24.2 percent, the
highest level registered so far this year.</P>
      <P>By region, the highest ratio of investment-oriented housing
buyers was recorded in Taipei County, at 31.1 percent, followed by
the city and county of Taichung at 30.7 percent, and Taipei City at
28.1 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT VOICES OPPOSITION TO PUBLIC UNIVERSITY TUITION HIKE PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 5 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
expressed Tuesday their strong opposition to a proposal to raise
public university tuition fees by between 2.4 percent and 10 percent
next year.</P>
      <P>Members of the KMT caucus at the Legislative Yuan held a press
conference to voice their discontent with the plan which was formed
Friday during a board meeting of the Association of National
Universities of Taiwan (ANUT) on a grounds that a tuition hike will
help efforts to maintain educational quality at public universities
amid rising costs.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hou Tsai-feng argued that as most families' income has
been seen shrinking in the country over the past several years, "it
will be more and more difficult for poor people to enter the higher
education system as they try to rise out of poverty."</P>
      <P>Citing governmental tallies, Hou said the income gap between the
richest 10 percent of families and the poorest 10 percent of families
in Taiwan expanded from 30.7 times in 2000 to 50 times last year.
Under the proposed tuition hike plan, a public university student
will have to pay NT$3,000-NT$6,000 (US$93-US$185) more in tuition per
semester, the KMT caucus member noted.</P>
      <P>National Taiwan University President Lee Si-chen, who also chairs
the ANUT, has revealed that the institution intends to raise tuition
fees by between 2 percent and 3 percent in 2007.</P>
      <P>The general tuition hike plan will be submitted to the 2007
conference of Taiwan's university presidents for discussion. It is
expected the hike will take effect at the start of the 2007 academic
year in September, according to Lee.</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu announced Tuesday
that Premier Su Tseng-chang will serve as President
Chen Shui-bian's special envoy in attending the Dec. 15 inauguration
of Gambian President Yahya Jammeh.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks after a luncheon for legislators in Taipei,

inauguration, according to Lu.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the PCC's inauguration is too close to Lu's Gambia
visit, Lu explained that President Chen Shui-bian had originally
asked her to serve as his envoy to attend the inauguration ceremony
Nov. 24, but the inauguration was later postponed to Dec. 15.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP CONTINUES TO BLAME KMT FOR LEAKING INFO ABOUT CHAIRMEN MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 5 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>James Soong, on leave from his People First
Party (PFP) chairmanship to run for Taipei mayor as an independent
candidate, blamed the Kuomintang's (KMT) key staff again Tuesday for
leaking information about his "secret meeting" with KMT Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou last Friday.</P>
      <P>The behind-closed-doors meeting held late at night -- and so late
in the municipal election campaign -- has sparked intense speculation
as to "what secret deals were reached" and "for what purpose." Taipei
and Kaohsiung voters elect their mayors and city council members Dec.
9.</P>
      <P>According to a newspaper report, Ma signed a written agreement on
three "conditions" during the meeting, under which Soong would make a
"graceful exit" from the intense mayoral race (to help secure KMT
nominee Hau Lung-bin's victory) : Soong would become convener of a
"KMT-PFP Alliance"; the KMT would "concede" some legislative seats to
PFP members; and the two parties would continue to cooperate in the
legislature.</P>
      <P>According to Wang Jin-pyng, a KMT member and speaker of the
Legislative Yuan, Ma later told him they had not discussed elections;
they had "only discussed" how to deal with a government request for a
special budget to procure weapons from the United States and how
their two parties would cooperate in the future.</P>
      <P>As for the report about a "secret deal" made between Ma and
Soong, Wang said he was "unaware" of such a deal. Soong himself
refused to respond to media queries concerning the reported "secret
deal."</P>
      <P>But Soong was unhappy his four-hour meeting with Ma was leaked to
the media, and strongly suspected it was the KMT side that broke the
agreement to keep it from public knowledge.</P>
      <P>Soong stressed that it was certainly not his party members who
leaked the information, adding "I believe it was not Mr. Ma who
released the information."</P>
      <P>Soong pointed at KMT Secretary-General Chan Chun-po, claiming
that if it wasn't Chan, could it be possible that Mr. Ma Ying-jeou
made the leak?</P>
      <P>The PFP leader also blamed the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP) Taipei mayor candidate, former Premier Frank Hsieh, for
releasing a photo of his secret meeting with Ma.</P>
      <P>How did Hsieh get that photo? Soong asked: "Was it provided by
the national security authorities? If not, by whom? Or was it Hsieh
who sent someone to monitor Ma's and my actions?"</P>
      <P>To Soong's accusation, Hsieh replied by returning the volley back
to "them" -- Soong and Ma -- saying "they know who took the picture."</P>
      <P>Hsieh noted that the journalist or amateur photographer met
"their people" when taking the picture.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said Ma and Soong's secret meeting could be seen as "a
victory of the doves inside the KMT and PFP, " whereas its leaking
could be attributed to hawks in both parties. He said people have a
right to know what the chairmen of the two opposition parties had
discussed behind the scenes.</P>
      <P>"If they had discussed an exit mechanism [for Soong in this
election], they could be suspected of having broken the law."</P>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang agreed that Ma and Soong should "honestly
tell the people" what they talked about, rather than "trying to hide
or cover up anything."</P>
      <P>Chen Ching-chun, secretary-general of the DPP's legislative
caucus, said the meeting between chairman of the largest opposition
party and a mayoral candidate at this stage of the election campaign
"gives people ample room for imagination" as to whether they had made
a deal on something.</P>
      <P>If their "cooperation" was aimed only at boosting their parties'
interests, people would not believe they could cooperate honestly
with each other, Chen added.</P>
      <P>KMT Spokesman Huang Yu-chen claimed that no secret deals had been
reached between Ma and Soong and that all of the fuss over the
so-called "secret meeting" should "stop here, " as his party would
focus all its efforts on winning municipal elections in Taiwan's two
largest cities.</P>
      <P>"No quid pro quos were made and no deals reached in secret. The
KMT thanks Mr. Soong for his enlightenment, and the goal of KMT-PFP
cooperation remains unchanged," Huang said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that
he had instructed the Executive Yuan to promote measures to lure back
capital from Taiwan businessmen operating in China.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while visiting Advanced
Semiconductor Engineering (ASE) Co.'s factory in Nantzu, Kaohsiung
County that day.</P>
      <P>ASE -- the world's largest chip packaging and testing company --
became a hot topic recently after reports of its buyout by the
U.S-based Carlyle Group, one of the largest private equity investment
firms in the world.</P>
      <P>Local attention has been focused on whether the buyout will hurt
Taiwan's capital market. If Carlyle's buyout bid succeeds, ASE might
be delisted from the Taiwan Stock Exchange and the media have also
been discussing if ASE's move was prompted by the government's
40-percent ceiling on investment in China.</P>
      <P>The president said he understands that Taiwan businesses are
adopting a global perspective, but added that he believes ASE will
stay in Taiwan and develop locally.</P>
      <P>He said the government's trade policy is to pursue sustainable
development and social justice, and is against globalization that
tilts too much toward China.</P>
      <P>Local businesses should keep risk management in mind and should
not place all their eggs in one basket, the president said.</P>
      <P>Chen advocated his administration's "active management, effective
opening" policy regarding cross-Taiwan Strait trade that was adopted
earlier this year to replace the "active opening, effective

      <P>The 2006 Austronesian Forum, sponsored by
the Cabinet-level Council of Indigenous Peoples, will take place Dec.
12-13 at National Pingtung University of Education's Minsheng campus
in southern Taiwan, with nearly 400 people participating.</P>
      <P>Among the foreign delegates will be political leaders from 14
countries, including Australia, Canada, Japan, Fiji, Kiribati, the
Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Zealand, the Solomon Islands, Palau,
Tuvalu and Venezuela, according to organizers.</P>
      <P>Topics to be discussed at the forum include strategies to revive
the native languages of the Austronesian peoples, preserving
Austronesian ecologies, establishing a platform for cultural
exchanges among the Austronesian peoples and promoting the
re-emergence of the various traditional tribes in the Austronesian
island countries.</P>
      <P>Taiwan hosted the first Assembly of Austronesian Leaders in
December 2002, bringing the Asia-Pacific island aboriginal cultures
together for the first time. The meeting concluded with a declaration
providing a vision for the development of Austronesian civilization
and outlining goals in promoting cooperation among Austronesian
peoples.</P>
      <P>In November 2003, aborigines from 12 Asia-Pacific countries,
including Taiwan, met again in Taipei and adopted a proposal to set
up a permanent forum with its preparatory office in Taipei to promote
cooperation and exchange among Austronesian aborigines.</P>
      <P>The Austronesian peoples share many common cultural roots, with
their territory stretching from Easter Island to Madagascar and from
New Zealand to the northern tip of Taiwan, covering nearly one-third
of the globe and representing a population of nearly 300 million.</P>
      <P>Linguists see Taiwan's indigenous population as pivotal to the
reconstruction of prehistoric Austronesian culture. With 10
indigenous tribes left on the island and 420,000 people who speak
languages of Austronesian derivation, Taiwan has been recognized as
an important center for studies of Austronesian heritage.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of flu cases is expected to
increase sharply over the coming month as the country has entered its
annual flu season, Center for Disease Control (CDC) officials said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>CDC tallies show that the number of flu cases has been rising
over the past month.</P>
      <P>While 3.08 in every 100 patients making outpatient visits
displayed flu-like symptoms in the first week of November, the ratio
climbed to 3.31 in every 100 patients in the second week, 3.28 in
every 100 patients in the third week and 3.36 in every 100 patients
in the fourth week, the tallies indicate.</P>
      <P>CDC officials urged the public to pay extra attention to their
health during the flu season and advised those who are especially
susceptible to flu, such as seniors and children, to get vaccinated
against the disease as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>According to the CDC, only 48.4 percent of people aged 65 or
above have so far received the free flu vaccinations offered by the
government, which is lower than the 57.7 percent registered during
the same time last year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The consumer price index (CPI) for November
rose 0.21 percent from the level of the same month last year,
according to tallies released Tuesday by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials attributed the rise to the fact that fuel, gas,
electricity and cigarette prices were higher this year compared with
of last year, although food prices registered a 2.25 percent drop.</P>
      <P>For the 11 months until November, the CPI was 0.59 percent higher
than the figure for the same period of last year, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS predicted the inflation rate for the whole of 2006 will
register 0.7 percent, which means the rise in consumer prices still
remains moderate, DGBAS officials said.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials said consumer prices has seen a slight increase
recently due to the hike in international raw material prices.</P>
      <P>For example, oil exported by OPEC countries costs US$55.42 per
barrel at present, up 8.1 percent over last year, they noted.</P>
      <P>In terms of grain prices, corn prices in November were double
that of last November, while prices of wheat and soy beans rose 65.1
percent and 22.9 percent year-on-year, respectively, they said.</P>
      <P>In terms of metal prices, nickel prices in November were up 175
percent year-on-year, while the prices of zinc and copper were up 159
percent and 59.9 percent, respectively, they said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the wholesale price index (WPI) for November increased
6.06 percent compared with the same month of last year, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>For the 11 months to November, the WPI was 5.58 percent higher
than the level for the same period last year, they said.</P>

US$3.32 billion from the month-earlier level, according to statistics

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Brazil-made commercial jets will enter the
Taiwan market in the near future, as Taipei-based Mandarin Airlines
has leased two commercial jets from the Empresa Brasileira de
Aeronautica S.A. (Embraer), a Mandarin spokesman said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, the first Embraer-made E-190 and
E-195 planes are slated to begin service with Mandarin Airlines from
May next year, replacing the company's existing Fokker planes.
Mandarin Airlines will take delivery of the Embraer planes in two
years, he added.</P>
      <P>The official admitted that the company's lease of the Embraer
planes is aimed at the fast-growing Chinese air travel market, as the
small- and medium-sized planes are suitable for plying routes between
Taiwan and as far away as Mongolia.</P>
      <P>However, the first of the planes to be introduced next year will
be used to ply the Hong Kong and Ho Chih Minh City routes, he noted.</P>
      <P>Embraer is one of the world's largest aircraft manufacturers,
focusing on specific market segments with high growth potential in
commercial, defense and executive aviation. The company was Brazil's
largest airplane exporter from 1999 to 2001.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A homosexual group announced its endorsement
of five candidates in the upcoming Taipei city council elections
Tuesday and demanded more homosexual-friendly policies from the
Taipei and Kaohsiung city governments.</P>
      <P>Based on candidates' past records and public statements, the
Taiwan Tonzhi Hotline Association (TTHA) said it will endorse Pan
Han-shen, Chan Ming-chou, Dai Hsi-chin, Lin Yi-hua and Chou Po-ya in
the Dec. 9 election for Taipei city councilors.</P>
      <P>Of the candidates, Pan is from the Green Party, which is been
known for supporting homosexual rights, while independent candidate
Chan Ming-chou claimed he is the first out of the closet homosexual
candidate in Taiwan's election history.</P>
      <P>"The homosexual population accounts for as much as 10 percent of
the population. Votes of homosexuals are going to be critical and
that is why candidates should not ignore the importance of these
voters, " said Kao Ying-chao, convener of the TTHA's human rights
group.</P>
      <P>The organization did not endorse any candidates in the elections
for Taipei and Kaohsiung city mayors or Kaohsiung city council, which
will also be held Dec. 9, as most candidates either failed to
answer questionnaires submitted by the group or lack past records
for review.</P>
      <P>However, Kaohsiung city mayoral candidate Chen Ju did mention
common-law partners and families of gay people in her White Paper,
while Taipei mayoral candidate Clara Chou is also listed as a
homosexual-friendly candidate.</P>
      <P>In the survey, most candidates were hesitant to specify their
views or policies on homosexuals, said Kao.</P>
      <P>Homosexual groups have submitted their recommendations and
endorsements in elections from as early as 1995, TTHA Public
Relations Director Wu Hsu-liang said, adding that they endorsed
candidates such as current legislators Hsiao Bi-khim, Cheng Yun-peng
and Joanna Lei in past elections.</P>
      <P>"Our surveys and endorsements are non-partisan. All we care about

    <HEADLINE>CARLYLE MIGHT SET UP TAIWAN AFFILIATE TO BUY OUT ASE: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 5 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior finance regulator said Tuesday that
the Carlyle Group of the United States might set up a Taiwan
affiliate to merge with Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASE) , a
Taiwan blue chip company which President Chen Shui-bian visited
earlier that day.</P>
      <P>If Carlyle forms a Taiwan-registered company to buy out ASE,
there will no longer be an issue of ASE becoming a foreign-invested
company that is trying to circumvent the government's restrictions on
investing in China, said Susan Chang, vice chairwoman of the
Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC).</P>
      <P>She noted that setting up a Taiwan affiliate could be "the most
beneficial way" for Carlyle to merge with ASE, the world's largest
computer chip packaging and testing firm.</P>
      <P>Critics have blamed the government for clamping a 40 percent
ceiling on Taiwan companies trying to invest a proportion of their
total assets in China, a regulation that forces them to find ways to
get around the restrictions.</P>
      <P>In Kaohsiung, where the president, Premier Su Tseng-chang and
Economic Affairs Minister Chen Ruey-long visited ASE, the president
urged ASE to "keep its roots in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The president praised ASE Chairman Chang Chien-sheng for claiming
the merger plan did not have anything to do with "expanding
investment in China."</P>
      <P>He also praised Chang for declaring ASE will not alter its policy
of keeping its roots in Taiwan and its plan of expanding investment
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The government welcomes any company, be it Taiwan-invested or
foreign-invested, to keep its roots in Taiwan, to operate in Taiwan,
and to increase investment in Taiwan," said Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>As the country seeks to change, there are things that it wants to
keep from changing, such as its economic policy goals of sustainable
development and social justice as well as prosperity for all, he
added.</P>
      <P>"If economic growth results only in increasing wealth
concentration in the hands of a few and in widening the gap between
rich and poor, how could we unite all people of Taiwan for a common
goal?" he asked.</P>
      <P>He said it is simply normal for a pluralistic democracy like
Taiwan to have different views on economic and trade policy, "and
yet, the government must not lose its direction but rather should
keep its vision and make its choices."</P>
      <P>The president reminded Taiwan's businesses that globalization
does not mean "sinification" and that they should not put "all their
eggs in a basket called China."</P>
      <P>On the other hand, he said, when a Taiwan company like ASE
implements its global business plan, it should not be distorted as
trying to leave or abandon Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The leader of the ongoing "Million Voices
Against Corruption" campaign said Tuesday that he will "imprison"
himself in the campaign's Taipei office from Tuesday until
scandal-ridden President Chen Shui-bian agrees to step down.</P>
      <P>Shih Ming-teh, a former chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) who launched the campaign in early September,
made clear his determination at a press conference after returning
from a trip to Thailand, where he attended an anti-corruption forum.</P>
      <P>Shih deplored that the government deployed some 500 police at the
airport to prevent followers of the anti-corruption campaign from
greeting him and causing a stir.</P>
      <P>He urged pro-DPP voters to vote for candidates of the "pan-blue
alliance" of the opposition Kuomintang and People First Party in the
Dec. 9 mayoral and city council elections in Taipei and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>"If you find it difficult to vote for opposition candidates,
please cast an invalid vote and don't let the corrupt regime in power
have a chance to continue its rule," Shih said.</P>
      <P>He admitted that when more than 1 million red-clad protesters
joined a parade in Taipei in October, the idea did cross his mind
about leading the protesters in breaking a police cordon and
occupying the Presidential Office and the president's residence.</P>
      <P>Shih added that on second thoughts, however, he gave up the idea
and told himself that it was not worthwhile to ruin Taiwan's
hard-earned democratic system simply for the sake of one corrupt
leader.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TIRES NOT CAUSE BEHIND TAIWAN'S WORST BUS ACCIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Worn tires are not the cause of Taiwan's
worst bus accident in two decades, said Chen Chin-yuan, chief
of the Directorate General of Highways under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of his office's preliminary investigation,
Chen said the tires on the front two wheels of the bus that crashed
into a ravine in Tainan County Sunday killing 21 persons were
manufactured in July, 2006, while the tires on its four rear wheels
were manufactured in January, 2006, all of which are within what Chen
described as the "six-year usable period of normal tires."</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Chen said, the tread on all six tires was more than
1.6 mm in depth as required by the regulations and ruled out the
possibility that the tires played any role in the accident.</P>
      <P>Chen said his office had also ruled out the possibility that the
road condition might have triggered the accident, saying that the
stretch of the road on which the accident took place is about 400
meters long with a slope of 5 degrees which is not very dangerous,
despite having many hairpin bends and bridges.</P>
      <P>In light of the fact the bus left 43-meter-long skid marks on the
road, Chen said the driver must have realized the vehicle was
traveling too fast and was trying hard to put the brake on it before
the accident, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He that suggested that human error and mechanical failure were
the possible reasons for the accident.</P>
      <P>Although the Directorate General of Highways finding was contrary
to media speculation that worn tread on the tires was a factor in the
accident, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications had
already decided to ban the use of retread tires by tour buses in any
case.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CARLYLE MIGHT SET UP TAIWAN AFFILIATE TO BUY OUT ASE: OFFICIAL(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 5 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior finance regulator said Tuesday that
the Carlyle Group of the United States might set up a Taiwan
affiliate to merge with Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASE) , a
Taiwan blue chip company which President Chen Shui-bian visited
earlier that day.</P>
      <P>If Carlyle forms a Taiwan-registered company to buy out ASE,
there will no longer be an issue of ASE becoming a foreign-invested
company that is trying to circumvent the government's restrictions on
investing in China, said Susan Chang, vice chairwoman of the
Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC).</P>
      <P>She noted that setting up a Taiwan affiliate could be "the most
beneficial way" for Carlyle to merge with ASE, the world's largest
computer chip packaging and testing firm.</P>
      <P>Critics have blamed the government for clamping a 40 percent
ceiling on Taiwan companies trying to invest a proportion of their
total assets in China, a regulation that forces them to find ways to
get around the restrictions.</P>
      <P>In Kaohsiung, where the president, Premier Su Tseng-chang and
Economic Affairs Minister Chen Ruey-long visited ASE, the president
urged ASE to "keep its roots in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The president praised ASE Chairman Chang Chien-sheng for claiming
the merger plan did not have anything to do with "expanding
investment in China."</P>
      <P>He also praised Chang for declaring ASE will not alter its policy
of keeping its roots in Taiwan and its plan of expanding investment
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The government welcomes any company, be it Taiwan-invested or
foreign-invested, to keep its roots in Taiwan, to operate in Taiwan,
and to increase investment in Taiwan," said Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>As the country seeks to change, there are things that it wants to
keep from changing, such as its economic policy goals of sustainable
development and social justice as well as prosperity for all, he
added.</P>
      <P>"If economic growth results only in increasing wealth
concentration in the hands of a few and in widening the gap between
rich and poor, how could we unite all people of Taiwan for a common
goal?" he asked.</P>
      <P>He said it is simply normal for a pluralistic democracy like
Taiwan to have different views on economic and trade policy, "and
yet, the government must not lose its direction but rather should
keep its vision and make its choices."</P>
      <P>The president reminded Taiwan's businesses that globalization
does not mean "sinification" and that they should not put "all their
eggs in a basket called China."</P>
      <P>On the other hand, he said, when a Taiwan company like ASE
implements its global business plan, it should not be distorted as
trying to leave or abandon Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The leader of the ongoing "Million Voices
Against Corruption" campaign said Tuesday that he will "imprison"
himself in the campaign's Taipei office from Tuesday until
scandal-ridden President Chen Shui-bian agrees to step down.</P>
      <P>Shih Ming-teh, a former chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) who launched the campaign in early September,
made clear his determination at a press conference after returning
from a trip to Thailand, where he attended an anti-corruption forum.</P>
      <P>Shih deplored that the government deployed some 500 police at the
airport to prevent followers of the anti-corruption campaign from
greeting him and causing a stir.</P>
      <P>He urged pro-DPP voters to vote for candidates of the "pan-blue
alliance" of the opposition Kuomintang and People First Party in the
Dec. 9 mayoral and city council elections in Taipei and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>"If you find it difficult to vote for opposition candidates,
please cast an invalid vote and don't let the corrupt regime in power
have a chance to continue its rule," Shih said.</P>
      <P>He admitted that when more than 1 million red-clad protesters
joined a parade in Taipei in October, the idea did cross his mind
about leading the protesters in breaking a police cordon and
occupying the Presidential Office and the president's residence.</P>
      <P>Shih added that on second thoughts, however, he gave up the idea
and told himself that it was not worthwhile to ruin Taiwan's
hard-earned democratic system simply for the sake of one corrupt
leader.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TIRES NOT CAUSE BEHIND TAIWAN'S WORST BUS ACCIDENT(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Worn tires are not the cause of Taiwan's
worst bus accident in two decades, said Chen Chin-yuan, chief
of the Directorate General of Highways under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of his office's preliminary investigation,
Chen said the tires on the front two wheels of the bus that crashed
into a ravine in Tainan County Sunday killing 21 persons were
manufactured in July, 2006, while the tires on its four rear wheels
were manufactured in January, 2006, all of which are within what Chen
described as the "six-year usable period of normal tires."</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Chen said, the tread on all six tires was more than
1.6 mm in depth as required by the regulations and ruled out the
possibility that the tires played any role in the accident.</P>
      <P>Chen said his office had also ruled out the possibility that the
road condition might have triggered the accident, saying that the
stretch of the road on which the accident took place is about 400
meters long with a slope of 5 degrees which is not very dangerous,
despite having many hairpin bends and bridges.</P>
      <P>In light of the fact the bus left 43-meter-long skid marks on the
road, Chen said the driver must have realized the vehicle was
traveling too fast and was trying hard to put the brake on it before
the accident, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He that suggested that human error and mechanical failure were
the possible reasons for the accident.</P>
      <P>Although the Directorate General of Highways finding was contrary
to media speculation that worn tread on the tires was a factor in the
accident, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications had
already decided to ban the use of retread tires by tour buses in any
case.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO BECOME HIGH-INCOME COUNTRY WITHIN 20 YEARS: MASTERCARD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is expected to advance from a
medium-income country to a high-income country within the next 20
years if it continues to transform its manufacturing economy into a
service economy, according to a report released Tuesday by MasterCard
Worldwide.</P>
      <P>Yuwa Hedrick-Wong, an economic advisor at the company, said that
in seeking to become a high-income country, Taiwan should boost its
labor productivity, increase its investment in education, strengthen
cross-Taiwan Strait communication and links, and increase research
and development.</P>
      <P>Also, Hedrick-Wong said Taiwan should create a better environment
to give Taiwanese businesses a stronger incentive to maintain their
roots in Taiwan and to invest more in the country to bolster domestic
demand and create more job opportunities.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's economic outlook for next year, the company predicted
that Taiwan's economy will post a growth rate of only 1.2 percent due
to low consumer confidence as a result of the credit card debt
problem and political uncertainties.</P>
      <P>According to Hedrick-Wong, while lower confidence will affect
consumer spending, a slowdown in the U.S. and Chinese economies is
also expected to affect Taiwan's economic performance, which relies
heavily on exports.</P>
      <P>In addition to declining consumer confidence, private consumption
in Taiwan has seen negative growth, and the production value of the
manufacturing sector as well as the country's labor productivity have
also been declining, he said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) Chairman Hu Sheng-cheng said MasterCard has
underestimated Taiwan's economic growth.</P>
      <P>Hu said the negative impact from the credit card debt problem
will diminish next year, while the cut in custom duties for imported
cars will also stimulate consumer spending.</P>
      <P>Mainstream economic research institutions in Taiwan generally
believe that the country's private consumption will register a growth
rate of 3 percent next year, and the CEPD has predicted that the
country's economy will grow by 3.2 percent, Hu noted.</P>
      <P>The CEPD's target is to achieve an economic growth rate of 4.6
percent next year, he said.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Law enforcement authorities will continue
relentless with anti-vote-buying efforts up to the Dec. 9 mayoral and
city council elections in Taipei and Kaohsiung, a ranking Ministry of
Justice (MOJ) official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Law enforcement officers will closely monitor whether any of the
candidates in the municipal elections are engaging in any activities
in violation of the Public Officials Election and Recall Law,
including vote-buying, violence and other irregularities, Vice
Justice Minister Wang Tien-sheng said.</P>
      <P>The Prosecutors' Offices in Taipei and Kaohsiung have received
463 vote-buying related complaints since anti-vote-buying and
anti-election violence task forces were established in Taiwan's two
largest cities and special municipalities under the Cabinet's direct
jurisdiction, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Among the complaints, 34 were related to the Taipei mayoral
election and 19 concerned the Kaohsiung mayoral race. Another 219
complaints were related to the Kaohsiung city council elections and
191 concerned Taipei city council races, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Two candidates have been taken into police custody for alleged
vote-buying, and one of them -- an incumbent city councilor -- has
been prosecuted on vote-buying charges, according to Wang.</P>
      <P>Noting that election bribery activities can be expected to
increase with campaigns shifting into high gear in the last few days
leading up to the elections, Wang urged the candidates to refrain
from vote-buying if they want to avoid prosecution and the
possibility of seeing their hard-fought election victories declared
null and void.</P>
      <P>Altogether, 192 candidates are taking part in the Taipei and
Kaohsiung mayoral and city council elections. Of that total, six are
running for Taipei mayor and five others are running for Kaohsiung
mayor. Another 103 candidates are competing for the 52 seats in the
Taipei city council, while 78 others are vying for the 44 seats in

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The rise in the female labor force
participation rate is mainly attributable to the upgrading of women's
average educational levels and the continued development of the
service industry rather than to a slowdown in the economy, the
country's top budget and accounting agency said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS) was responding to a recent media report that alleged that the
deterioration of the local economy is the main reason behind the
substantial increase in the number of double-income families.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials dismissed the report as "misleading," saying that
the ongoing rise in the rate of women's labor force participation
coincides with an increase in their educational attainment in recent
decades.</P>
      <P>The officials said the labor force participation rate of married
women with children under six years of age reached a 20-year high of
58 percent in 2006. The ratio was also higher than the percentage for
all married women, according to DGBAS tallies.</P>
      <P>Noting that women with children under 6 years of age tend to be
younger and better educated, the officials said this group of women
are less likely to quit jobs because of marriage or childbirth. Even
if they resign due to marriage or childbirth, they are more likely to
return to work.</P>
      <P>The officials further said that the enactment of women's welfare
promotion legislation, such as the workplace gender equality law, and
the implementation of various policy initiatives to increase women's
job opportunities have also contributed to the rise in the women's
labor force participation rate.</P>
      <P>The labor force participation rate refers to the percentage of
working-age persons in an economy who are employed or are unemployed
but looking for a job.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lin I-hsiung, former chairman of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , said Wednesday that despite his
past criticism of the party, he still thinks the DPP is the best
party in Taiwan and one that is moving toward a better direction.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks while accompanying Frank Hsieh, the DPP's
candidate in the Taipei mayoral race, to canvass votes in a suburban
Shihlin market with only three days remaining before the Dec. 9
election.</P>
      <P>Amid the DPP's slipping popularity in the wake of a series of
alleged corruption scandals implicating the family members of
President Chen Shui-bian and his senior aides, the presence of Lin,
who enjoys high esteem within the party, has greatly boosted the
morale of Hsieh, who is facing an uphill battle against Hau Lung-bin
of the main opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Lin lauded the performance of Hsieh over the years, saying that
he admires the former premier's caliber, integrity as well as his
warmth towards friends.</P>
      <P>Noting that he has been friends with Hsieh as well as Chen Chu,
the DPP's candidate in the Kaohsiung mayoral election, for years, Lin
said that "he will extend a hand to express solidarity."</P>
      <P>Lin, who has stayed out of the limelight since quitting the DPP
early this year because of his disappointment with the party, also
said that he would stump for Chen prior to Saturday's election.</P>
      <P>On questions about suggestions that he take the helm of the party
again after Saturday's election, Lin said "the question should be
left for discussion after the election."</P>
      <P>On whether the mayoral elections in Taipei and Kaoshiung
represent a confidence vote on the embattled president, Lin only said
that he came to the rally to meet people and not to touch on other

    <DATELINE>San Francisco, Dec. 5 (CNA)
(By Jih-chun Wu and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's physically challenged artist
Yang En-dian, whose legendary life story has inspired many in the
country, arrived in San Francisco recently for a lecture and
fundraising tour.</P>
      <P>Yang, 32, who was born without arms and later abandoned by her
parents, was raised at a southern Taiwan Catholic orphanage before
becoming a mouth and foot painting artist.</P>
      <P>She is being accompanied by her husband on the tour, during which
she will share her life story with Taiwanese and Chinese expatriates
living in the United States.</P>
      <P>Yang is also expected to raise funds by selling her own works
during the tour for the Liukuei Christian Orphanage, located in the
mountainous region of Kaohsiung County, where she was raised under
the intensive care of orphanage founder Father Yang and his wife.
Thanks to the care she received at the orphanage, Yang grew up to be
a courageous artist who now leads a happy and ordinary life as a
mother and a wife.</P>
      <P>Yang's lecture and fundraising tour on the U.S. West Coast will
also take her to Seattle and Los Angeles.</P>
      <P>In March 1974, Yang was brought to the orphanage after being
abandoned in a marketplace in Kangshan, Kaohsiung County. Believing
that the baby was "sent by the Lord, " Father Yang named the infant
Yang En-dian, meaning "grace and benevolence from God." Little did he
know that the child would grow up and develop a legendary friendship
with then-President Chiang Ching-kuo.</P>
      <P>President Chiang developed a special attachment to the child and
arranged for her to receive surgery in Taipei to help straighten her
spine and allow her to stand unaided. He even arranged for her to
learn Chinese brush painting and calligraphy.</P>
      <P>The child became a celebrity after a picture of her and President
Chiang was made into a postage stamp.</P>
      <P>Yang did not let the president down and grew up to earn her own
living by selling her art works.</P>
      <P>Yang gave birth last year to a healthy baby girl, whom she now
bottle-feeds using her feet. She initiated a drive early this year to
share and distribute breast milk to help mothers who cannot feed
their babies with their own breast milk and whose babies are allergic
to formulated milk.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 6 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Sixty-six percent of Taiwan office workers
are interested in working in China, with many optimistic about
China's development prospects, according to the results of a survey
released Wednesday by an online employment service provider.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by Pan Asia Job Bank from Nov. 17-27 on
2,149 office workers via online questionnaires.</P>
      <P>While 43 percent of the respondents expressed "a high degree of
interest" in working in China, 23 percent expressed "an extremely
high degree of interest."</P>
      <P>On the reasons why they are considering working in China, 40
percent of the respondents said China's development prospects are
promising, 30 percent said they want to increase their work
experience, and 17 percent said jobs are hard to find in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The survey shows that most of the workers interested in working
in China are in the 26-30 age group, accounting for more than 30
percent of all surveyed workers. The second largest group is those
aged 40 or above, accounting for 24.5 percent of all surveyed
workers.</P>
      <P>Of these workers, 58.8 percent are men, 45.2 percent are
university graduates, and more than 50 percent are single.</P>
      <P>Among the workers who have no intention to work in China, many
said they do not want to leave their home country because of family
factors, and others said there are still a lot of development
opportunities in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Other reasons cited by the workers for not considering working in
China include the bad law and order situation in China and the lack
of rule of law there.</P>
      <P>On the top concerns in deciding whether they will actually accept
any offer to work in China, 32 percent of the respondents mentioned
the pay offered by Chinese companies, 26 percent said they will
assess the prospect of the industry they plan to enter, 13 percent
said they will consider the benefits offered by Chinese companies,
and 12 percent said they will see if they are able to display their
expertise in the job being offered.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 93 percent of the respondents think it will pose a
threat to local workers if the government is to allow Chinese
citizens to work in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER CALLS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF AID EQUIPMENT FOR DISABLED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang called Wednesday for
government-initiated efforts to develop disability equipment and
caregiving facilities to benefit the physically challenged.</P>
      <P>At a regular Executive Yuan meeting, Su instructed that the
establishment of a center for demography, health and social
protection studies should be included in the Cabinet's "Mega Warmth"
social welfare project to further improve care for the physically
challenged.</P>
      <P>Under the envisaged center, there should be an agency exclusively
responsible for the development of disability equipment and
caregiving facilities, Su said.</P>
      <P>Noting that disability equipment and mobility aids are the eyes,
hands, legs and feet of the handicapped, Su said the government
should initiate efforts to enable this special group of people to
have better "eyes, hands, legs and feet" so they can enjoy higher
quality of life.</P>
      <P>He said that in addition to developing and making aid and
caregiving equipment, the government should also spare no efforts to
improve public facilities accessible to and usable by the physically
challenged to make Taiwan "a genuinely barrier free country."</P>

    <HEADLINE>CEPD OUTLINES  PRIORITIES FOR 2007 ECONOMIC AGENDA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  6  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will focus on three
priorities next year in order to realize its economic growth target,
with stimulating domestic demand topping the list, an official with
the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Also high on the work agenda are stepping up research and
development as well as boosting employment and narrowing the wealth
gap and urban-rural divide, the official said.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks after CEPD commissioners passed the country's
2007 economic development plan a day earlier, which set next year's
economic growth target at 4.6 percent, the per capita gross domestic
product (GDP) at US$16,886, the unemployment rate at 3.9 percent and
the inflation at below 2 percent.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the U.S. economy is expected to slow
down next year which could affect Taiwan's export growth to some
extent. And this is why Taiwan should spur domestic demand to bolster
its continued economic expansion, the official said.</P>
      <P>To realize this goal, he said, the government will continue
expanding public investment, accelerating relaxation of regulations
governing the service industry, perfecting the domestic investment
environment and further invigorating the financial market.</P>
      <P>"Through all these measures, we expect to see a 3 percent growth
in private consumption in real terms in 2007," said the official.</P>
      <P>With gross fixed capital formation expected to maintain the
traditional level of around 20 percent of GDP, the official said,
domestic demand will be able to contribute to more than 60 percent of
next year's economic growth.</P>
      <P>On the R&amp;D promotion, he said, the government's 2007 budget for
scientific and technological development will increase 10.8 percent
from this year's level, which is higher than the average 7.9 percent
growth posted in the past three years.</P>
      <P>"We hope our R&amp;D investment will spawn a cluster effect by
attracting more high-tech companies to invest in Taiwan as well as
enhance our labor productivity and expand value-added output, " the
official explained.</P>
      <P>While pursuing economic growth, the official said, the government
will not overlook the importance of achieving balanced development.</P>
      <P>"Equal emphasis will be given on creating jobs so that local
citizens can make a living, " the official said, adding that the
government's target is to keep the unemployment rate below 4 percent
throughout next year.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he added, the government will continue working to
narrow the gap between the rich and the poor as well as bridge the
divide between urban and rural regions. "Our target is to pull the
wealth gap between the richest 20 percent and the 20 percent down to
below six-fold," the official said.</P>
      <P>According to the official, 2007 will be the first year of the
first three-year stage of a long-term national development plan valid
until 2015, which is aimed at increasing investment in Taiwan,
creating jobs, narrowing the wealth gap and balancing development in
metropolitan areas and the countryside.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAICHUNG MAYOR'S WIFE GRADUALLY REGAINS SPEECH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The wife of Taichung Mayor Jason Hu is
gradually recovering her power of speech after being in coma for the
past 18 days since a serious car crash, a doctor at the Chi Mei
Medical Center in southern Tainan County said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>But Hou Ching-cheng, director of the center's intensive care
unit, said Shao Hsiao-ling can only say a few words and cannot utter
a complete sentence.</P>
      <P>Her eyes can follow specific objects and her Glasgow coma scale
had moved up one notch to 12 for the past few days, Hou said. Her
medical team is now cautiously assessing when she can be transferred
to a hospital nearer Taichung, where Hu and Shao live.</P>
      <P>Shao has a swallow reflex but still requires a naso-gastric tube
for feeding, Hou added.</P>
      <P>Hu believes that a disc of him and their two children speaking
has had an effect on bringing Shao out of the coma, according to
Taichung Deputy Mayor Hsiao Chia-chi.</P>
      <P>He is now recording another disc with Shao's favorite songs and
music, as well as placing some of her favorite paintings and food
around her hospital bed, in the hope that this will revive her senses
of smell and listening as well as her memory, Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>Hsiao said that Hu, who was only slightly injured in the
accident, will return to work Monday and that he hopes to have his
wife transferred to a hospital near Taichung. If that is not
possible, Hu plans to travel to the Tainan hospital every day to see
his wife, Hsiao added.</P>
      <P>Hu and Shao were returning from a stumping trip to Kaohsiung Dec.
18 when their minivan was hit by another vehicle on the freeway that
lost control after trying to overtake Hu's van on the hard shoulder.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday
democracy, freedom, peace and human rights is the backbone of
Taiwan's survival and the platforms bridging Taiwan with the world's
democratic community.</P>
      <P>Making the remarks while receiving a delegation from the
Washington-based Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA) , a
pro-independence lobbying group composed of mainly
Taiwanese-Americans, Chen thanked FAPA for its firm support for
Taiwan and its contribution in helping the country expand its foreign
relations.</P>
      <P>Over the past 25 years, FAPA has stood firm by the people of
Taiwan and has worked hard to fight for the support of the U.S.
Congress for Taiwan's democracy, freedom and human rights, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He also expressed gratitude to FAPA for its efforts in promoting
a free trade agreement (FTA) between Taiwan and the United States.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the United States is engaging in FTA talks
with South Korea and Thailand -- the seventh- and ninth-largest
trading partners of the United States, respectively.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, as the eighth-largest trading partner of the United
States, is not inferior to the two Asian countries in terms of
economic strength, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He further cited statistics showing that the purchasing power of
the Taiwan people is higher than the combined purchasing power of the
six Central American nations that have signed the Central America
Free Trade Agreement with the United States.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that these six Central American nations are all
Taiwan's diplomatic allies, Chen said the establishment of a
Taiwan-U.S. FTA will bring substantial business interests to many
American businesses and enhance the economic and trade relations
between Taiwan and the United States.</P>
      <P>He said that although Taiwan and the United States remain divided
on trade issues such as pharmaceuticals, intellectual property rights
and telecommunications, this should not hamper FTA talks, because the
main purpose of FTA talks is to remove bilateral trade barriers.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>James Soong, head of the opposition People
First Party (PFP) who is running as an independent in the Dec. 9
Taipei mayoral election, sued his ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) rival Wednesday for "allegedly trying to make him lose the
election."</P>
      <P>Chu Ou, convener of Soong's election campaign headquarters, took
the legal action at the Taipei Prosecutors Office against Frank
Hsieh, who claimed a day earlier that someone sent him an e-mail
saying that Soong was slated to announce Dec. 6 that he was pulling
out of the Taipei mayoral election.</P>
      <P>Soong's election campaign headquarters denied the rumor and said
that Soong will take part in the election. They argued that Hsieh's
move, apparently aimed at making Soong lose the election, was in
violation of the Election and Recall Law.</P>
      <P>According to Chu, Soong has demanded that Hsieh clarify the
source of the e-mail message. If Hsieh refuses to do so, it would
mean that he had intentionally divulged the rumor in an attempt to
make Soong fail in the election, Chu said.</P>
      <P>With only three days left before Saturday's elections, Soong is
determined to counter any defamation or smear through legal action,
Chu said.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
member said Wednesday that he will sue Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou and People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong on
charges of vote buying, claiming that a recent "secret" meeting they
had will seriously affect the Dec. 9 special municipality elections.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-ming, a TSU candidate in the Taipei city council
election, announced his lawsuit plan against Ma and Soong at a news
conference.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the Ma-Soong closed-door meeting last Friday
will severely affect the outcome of the elections and was an "obvious
violation" of Article 89 of the Election and Recall Law.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed that Ma and Soong met in secret in total disregard
of public sentiment and political ethics, to secure personal
political gains. He further claimed that deals made between them
regarding the elections were purely exchanges of political interests.</P>
      <P>He urged Soong, who is running as an independent in the Taipei
mayoral election, to "stop deceiving voters" and pull out of the
race. Ma and Soong should also immediately apologize to the public,
he argued.</P>
      <P>Ma and Soong are reported to have met last Friday to discuss
Soong's pullout from the Taipei mayoral election -- something that is
widely perceived by the "pan-green camp" of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party and its ally, the TSU, as a tactic of the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP to help the
KMT's candidate, Hau Lung-bin, in the race.</P>
      <P>It was reported that Ma and Soong reached three agreements to
pave the way for their future cooperation in the Legislative Yuan and
in the coming elections, but both Ma and Soong have denied such
reports.</P>

      <P>Hopes were strong Wednesday that
Taiwanese woman soft tennis player, Chiang Wan-chi, would win the
country's first gold medal at the 15th Asian Games being held in
Doha, Qatar, later that day.</P>
      <P>In a laudable performance earlier in the day, Chiang beat her
South Korean rival, Kim Ji Eun, in the women's singles semifinal in
four straight matches, to challenge China's Jiang Ting, who defeated
Japan's Tsuji Miwa in the other semifinal that same day.</P>
      <P>Taiwan hopes to win 15 gold medals at the 15th Asian Games that
opened in Doha Dec. 1, but officials of the Cabinet-level National

from Chinese Taipei's women's soft tennis team would win any golds.</P>
      <P>A total of 391 athletes are representing Chinese Taipei in 34
events at the games, which will run through Dec. 15.</P>
      <P>Chinese Taipei previously envisaged winning gold in about 10
sports -- taekwondo, archery, shooting, karate, tennis, soft tennis,
table tennis, rhythmic gymnastics, bowling and golf. It was also
hoping to pick up gold in the equestrian event.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Winning the Dec. 9 Kaohsiung mayoral
election is the most important thing for the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) at present, and all other things are of secondary concern, KMT
spokesman Huang Yu-cheng said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Huang told reporters that KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou attaches
great importance to the final three days in the lead-up to the
election and has asked party officials and members to make all-out
efforts to help KMT candidate Huang Chun-ying get elected.</P>
      <P>The spokesman noted that Ma has already traveled to Kaohsiung 15
times to stump for the KMT nominee and will continue to do so in the
next three days.</P>
      <P>The KMT was defeated in the previous two mayoral elections in
Kaohsiung, but the emergence of one corruption scandal after another
involving the ruling Democratic Progressive Party in both the central
government and the Kaohsiung city government in recent years has
created a favorable climate for the KMT to recapture the Kaohsiung
mayorship.</P>
      <P>The latest polls show that Huang Chun-ying is ahead of his DPP
opponent Chen Chu in voter approval by about 20 percent.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on a secret meeting last Friday between Ma and
opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong, the KMT spokesman
said the two leaders only talked about future cooperation between the
two partners in the "pan-blue alliance" and reached some consensus in
principle.</P>
      <P>He said there was no quid pro quo about what the two parties
should do regarding their candidates in the Taipei mayoral election
and that neither had Ma and Soong signed any agreements to that
effect.</P>
      <P>Soong is running as an independent in Taipei against five other
candidates, including KMT nominee Hau Lung-bin and the DPP candidate,
former Premier Frank Hsieh.</P>
      <P>A TVBS opinion poll released two days ago show Hau leading with a
54 percent voter approval rate, against Hsieh's 20 percent and
Soong's 9 percent. These results represent only slight changes
compared with previous polls -- an indication that the Ma-Soong
meeting had little influence on the voters.</P>
      <P>There was speculation after the Ma-Soong meeting that they might
have reached a secret deal on Ma helping Soong get elected, with
Soong pledging to support Ma to win the 2008 presidential election,
but both leaders denied they discussed anything about the mayoral
election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE CONDEMNS JUDICIAL YUAN FOR FREEING KEY WITNESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislature's Judiciary Committee
adopted a resolution Wednesday condemning the Judicial Yuan for
releasing Tang Shou-yi, who made and sold the gun supposedly used to
shoot at the president and the vice president on the eve of the 2004
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Tang, who fled the country after serving a jail term for another
crime last May, claimed recently that he gave false testimony at the
request of investigators probing the March 19, 2004 shooting of
President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>He reportedly gave the false testimony in exchange for a chance
to flee the country, a plan he claimed he executed after getting a
phone call from a prosecutor.</P>
      <P>Legislators asked why the prosecution did not seek to detain
Tang, a key witness in the presidential assassination case, when his
jail term expired.</P>
      <P>The prosecution should at least have demanded a bond and
restricted his residency before releasing him, said the lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Deputy Justice Minister Wang Tien-sheng said prosecutors can do
nothing if the judges decide to release a witness in a criminal case
being handled in the court.</P>
      <P>"This is what the criminal code stipulates, " said Wang, who
claimed that he was not trying to shift the responsibility for
releasing Tang to the Judicial Yuan.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yi-jin, a ruling Democratic Progressive Party lawmaker, said
that since the prosecutors are not responsible for failing to request
Tang's further detention, a resolution should be adopted to condemn
the Judicial Yuan's judges for freeing him.</P>
      <P>Her proposed resolution, which was later passed by the committee,
said the Judicial Yuan's judges failed to detain Tang or ban him from
leaving the country, leading to his claims made from abroad that have
damaged the reputation of the country's police investigators and
justice system.</P>
      <P>In answer to lawmakers' demands for an investigation of the
prosecutors to determine if they violated work ethics, Wang claimed
that Tang's accusation against the prosecution was groundless and
said he had confidence in the prosecutors.</P>
      <P>The deputy minister said the government has put Tang on a wanted
list and hopes he will return to Taiwan to face justice.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker Lai Shyh-bao said Tang's
accusations, however idle they might sound, have hurt the Ministry of
Justice most, because people will have the impression that Taiwan is
a police state where politics is in control of everything else.</P>
      <P>Wang said he will forward the legislator's opinion to Prosecutor-
General Wu Ying-chao, who is responsible for the investigation into
the shooting.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Indigenous
Peoples (CIP) sponsored a citation ceremony Wednesday for individuals
and groups in honor of their outstanding efforts in helping
aboriginal people quit alcohol, a council spokesman said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The activity was held in a carnival-like atmosphere in which
private individuals and representatives from hospitals and charitable
organizations from around the country were cited for their remarkable
achievements in helping aboriginal people regain their health by
staying away from alcohol.</P>
      <P>The council also unveiled the results of its "quit alcohol"
program in which the people and groups cited have taken part for many
years.</P>
      <P>CIP Vice Chairman Hsu Ming-yuan said that the council hopes to
assist aboriginal people in quitting alcohol and maintaining health
through the program.</P>
      <P>Hsu ascribed the aboriginal people's shorter average life
expectancy -- five years less than other Taiwan residents -- to
alcohol addiction and stressed that it is very important to teach
them the right way to drink yet stay healthy.</P>
      <P>Traffic accidents, liver-related disease, cardiac problems,
stroke, diabetes and obesity -- all closely related to alcohol abuse
-- are the major illnesses afflicting Taiwan's aboriginal people, Hsu

      <P>Crime penetrating into the outlying Kinmen

past year, law enforcement authorities on the outlying island said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The conclusion was reached during a joint law enforcement meeting

chief prosecutor of the Kinmen Prosecutors' Office, presided over the
meeting.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by the office, Liu reported that 124
criminal cases related to the "mini three links" -- direct trade and
shipping links between Taiwan's Kinmen and Matsu islands and Xiamen
and Mawei ports in China's Fujian province -- were reported to Kinmen
law enforcement authorities in the first 10 months of this year, down
from the previous year's 174 cases, or nearly 29 percent
year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Liu called for closer cooperation between the various government

    <HEADLINE>CANADIAN INDIGENOUS LEADERS SHARE EXPERIENCE WITH TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 6 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A pair of Canadian indigenous leaders shared
experiences and expertise with their Taiwanese counterparts in a
workshop on Canada's aboriginal self-governance and economic
development Wednesday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"In terms of aboriginal relations and development, Canada was far
from perfect -- it even made some mistakes in the past. But it can
share its experience in aboriginal affairs with Taiwan," said David
Hamilton, director of general relations of the Canadian Trade Office
in Taipei (CTOT) at the workshop, which was co-organized by CTOT and
Taiwan's Council of Indigenous Peoples.</P>
      <P>From 1870-1950, Canadian aboriginals went through a long period
of discrimination just like aboriginals in other countries, said
Larry Chartrand, a professor at the University of Winnipeg who also
serves as the director of Canada's Aboriginal Governance Program.</P>
      <P>It wasn't until 1969 that aboriginals in Canada mobilized and
responded through massive protests and pushed for a new relationship
between the Canadian government and aboriginal people. After three
subsequent constitutional amendments in 1982, the Canadian government
began to negotiate one by one with aboriginal tribes on
self-governance issues, he said.</P>
      <P>However, Canadian aboriginals still face great challenges today
such as land claims, the scope of self-governance, and continuing
poverty and discrimination, Chartrand noted.</P>
      <P>"It's our belief that what you do today will affect seven
generations later," said Romeo Crow, a Blackfoot tribe chief of the
Siksika Nation, who also serves as president of the Aboriginal
Financial Officers Association.</P>
      <P>The Blackfoot tribe, a group of nomads that followed buffaloes in
the past, has been trying to build its own business, increase the
group's educational enrollment rate while at the same time preserving
its tradition and culture, Crow said.</P>
      <P>Self-governance is one thing, a vision to plan for the future
instead of dwelling on the present is another, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'DUMP VS. SAVE' RUMORS ABOUND IN TAIPEI MAYORAL CAMPAIGNSBy S.C. ChangCNA Staff Writer</HEADLINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P> All major candidates for Taipei mayor were straining to appeal to
supporters Wednesday as rumors of "dumping one candidate to save
another" abounded in the final stage of the municipal election
campaign, with voters in the capital electing a new mayor and city
council members Dec. 9.</P>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) candidate for mayor, former
Environment Minister Hau Lung-bin, had KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and
Honorary Chairman Lien Chan making a statement that "Hau is the only
one we support" in an attempt to dash the rumor of Ma reaching a
secret deal with People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong under
which Hau would be "dumped" for Soong to get elected.</P>
      <P>Indeed, the Dec. 1 secret meeting just days before the vote
between Ma and Soong, who is on leave from his party post to run as
an independent, has created a bombshell in the election campaign the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party was quick to seize as
opportunity.</P>
      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh, the DPP candidate vying with Hau and
Soong, has issued a photo of the secret meeting and sent text
messages to cellphones alleging that Soong would quit the race
Wednesday, in a bid to generate sympathy for Soong among "pan-blue
alliance" voters, hoping more Soong votes would reduce Hau's chances
of winning. Hau had been leading in public opinion polls.</P>
      <P>Observers said judging from Soong's strong reaction to the
allegation -- he has sued the Hsieh camp for violating election law
-- and his impassioned campaign speech against the KMT, Soong might
have won some sympathy, to the DPP campaign's delight.</P>
      <P>By increasing Soong's media exposure, KMT Taipei Chapter head Pan
Chia-sen said, Hsieh's "real purpose" was more likely to boost the
Soong campaign than to damage it.</P>
      <P>If Hsieh's strategy works as he has wished, "pan-blue" voters
will likely be divided into those voting for Soong and those voting
for Hau -- benefiting Hsieh with the alliance's split vote.</P>
      <P>Meanswhile, Hsieh himself faced a threat from his "pan-green
camp" ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union's (TSU) "dumped" nominee,
former media personality Chou Yu-kou, who was almost kicked out of
the party and has lost the support of her party in the campaign.</P>
      <P>Chou has been campaigning on a theme of anti-corruption, hoping
to win the support of some 30 percent of the swing vote that she
considered to be the "rational and conscientious" middle class. Her
focus on Hsieh's suspected involvement in the Kaohsiung rapid transit
scandal might cut a dent into the former Kaohsiung mayor's support
base.</P>
      <P>Lee Ao is another lone fighter in the six-way mayoral race in
Taipei, campaigning on the theme of "opposing military purchases" and
"standing up to the central government" in an attempt to solicit
support from what he claimed to be "smart and young" Taipei citizens
aged between 20 and 50.</P>
      <P>"Follow the light, instead of following blue or green, " Lee, an
independent lawmaker, urged his electorate, reminding the "blue" half
of them not to be fooled a fourth time by the mantra of "pan-blue
unity."</P>
      <P>In the city council race, where 103 candidates are vying for 52
seats, what they hated most to hear from voters was "you're sure to
win" -- a sentence that they feared could easily turn to mean "you're
sure to lose, " because results are so uncertain they could go in any
direction.</P>
      <P>Against such a backdrop, any candidate is likely to cry out for
"save me" votes no matter how certain he or she might be about the
vote -- an interesting phenomenon at this late stage of the campaign.</P>

County's Japanese School, led by their president, dedicated 1,000
paper cranes to Taichung Mayor Jason Hu Wednesday to wish his wife an
early recovery from injuries sustained in an accident 18 days ago.</P>
      <P>Mikio Tatsui, president of the Taichung Japanese School,
presented the paper cranes -- a symbol of longevity -- to Taichung
Deputy Mayor Hsiao Chia-chi, asking him to relay the students' good
wishes to the mayor and his wife, Shirley Shao.</P>
      <P>Tatsui said the pupils began to fold the origami birds -- with
the target set at 1,000 -- as soon as they heard the bad news about
the accident.</P>
      <P>Japanese people believe that by folding 1,000 paper cranes, the
gods will grant their wish and make a sick loved one healthy again.</P>
      <P>Tatsui also expressed hope that the mayor's wife could visit the
Japanese School after she has fully recovered.</P>
      <P>Hu has accompanied his wife at Chi Mei Medical Center in Tainan
County since Nov. 18. He indicated Wednesday that he will return to
work at the Taichung city government from Dec. 11 after doctors
agreed to move his wife from the intensive care unit to an ordinary
ward.</P>
      <P>The mayor's wife is now able to open her eyes and repeat simple
words after her husband, such as "go home," but doctors said this
does not mean her language-related brain functions are back to
normal.</P>
      <P>She was in a coma for 17 days after a medical team performed two

China-bound investment and cross-Taiwan Strait economic exchanges.</P>
      <P>The article claimed that Taiwan has continued losing chances of
taking full advantage of rapid economic growth in China's coastal

China-bound investment and cross-Taiwan Strait economic exchanges.</P>
      <P>The article claimed that Taiwan has continued losing chances of
taking full advantage of rapid economic growth in China's coastal
regions over the past decade, and has consequently stagnated in its
economic development.</P>
      <P>Hu said the "Topics" commentary was warped by preconception and
exaggeration, insisting the government has consistently pulled out
all stops to promote commercial exchanges across the Taiwan Strait
and create a sound investment climate.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Hu said, the government has spared no effort over the
years to ease restrictions on cross-strait economic and investment
activities.</P>
      <P>On providing visions for future development, Hu said the
government has come up with "mega investment" and "mega warmth"
projects that encourage investment in Taiwan and emphasize care for
the economic and social well-being of the disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>"We have unveiled five packages of measures to reinvigorate our
economy from five dimensions -- industrial development, fianncial
market reform, manpower cultivation, infrastructure construction and
social welfare," Hu added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINESE TOURISTS EXPECTED TO BOOST TAIWAN'S GDP: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 7 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese tourists are expected to contribute
0.1 percentage points per year to Taiwan's gross domestic product
(GDP) after Taiwan opens its doors wider to Chinese tourists,
according to a report released Wednesday by the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>The estimate is based on the presumption that 1,000 Chinese
tourists are allowed to visit Taiwan per day, which translates into
365,000 people per year.</P>
      <P>With each of the tourists staying in Taiwan for seven to eight
days on average and spending an average of NT$5,600 (US$173) per day,
they will increase Taiwan's private consumption by NT$16 billion per
year, CEPD officials said.</P>
      <P>Citing the spending data of Chinese tourists in Hong Kong, the
officials pointed out that each Chinese tourist spent a total of
HK$4,554 (US$586) on average during their stay in Hong Kong in 2005,
with HK$2,979, or 65 percent, being spent on shopping, and HK$610
being spent on dining and drinking.</P>
      <P>Compared with American and European tourists who tend to spend
most on hotels, Chinese tourists obviously pay more attention to
shopping than accommodations, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The total of 12.54 million Chinese tourist arrivals in Hong Kong
in 2005 contributed 4 percentage points to the GDP of the special
administrative region for the year, they noted.</P>
      <P>Based on the experience of Hong Kong, the CEPD proposed that
Taiwan create a good shopping environment and step up marketing of
indigenous products to appeal to Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>In addition, with hotels in Taiwan providing only a total of
21,000 rooms, it is urgent that more hotels be built to cope with the
accommodation needs of Chinese tourists, according to the CEPD.</P>
      <P>However, in light of the fact that Chinese tourists are less
choosy about accommodations, the CEPD suggested that more three-star
budget hotels be made available.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOONG SHOULD QUIT POLITICS IF MAYORAL BID FAILS: DPP LAWMAKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 7 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Calling People First Party (PFP) Chairman
James Soong "the source of chaos in Taiwan, " ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) legislators demanded Thursday that he quit
politics if he loses the Dec. 9 Taipei mayoral election.</P>
      <P>Soong is on leave from his party post to run as an independent in
the Taipei mayoral race, which some observers say could lead to a
split of the "pan-blue" vote between himself and the KMT's candidate,
Hau Lung-bin, allowing the DPP's candidate, Frank Hsieh, to take the
election.</P>
      <P>During a press conference, Ker Chien-ming, convener of the DPP
legislative caucus, accused Soong of being a "master schemer" who is
working with KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou to "cover up each other's
shady business" and to block the nation's development.</P>
      <P>Ker said he is not concerned that the DPP might lose badly in the
Taipei and Kaohsiung municipal elections. "What worries me is that
the state machine might be torn apart," he said, referring to the PFP
legislators' proposal for direct flights across the Taiwan Strait
that had twice caused the legislature to "rev an empty engine"
recently.</P>
      <P>The DPP heavyweight said the "blue-green" standoff has gotten
worse since Ma became KMT chairman last year, for which he said Soong
should be blamed.</P>
      <P>He called on voters to put an end to "extremism" in Taiwan and
look at the two municipal elections with calm and reason, so that the
country will not "continue to be divided."</P>
      <P>Elaborating on Ker's accusations against Soong, DPP lawmaker Wu
Ping-jui said Soong's PFP had hijacked the KMT in the legislature,
leading to its failure to approve such important decisions as the
nomination of the prosecutor general and the government bill on
purchasing key weapon systems to upgrade the nation's defense
capabilities.</P>
      <P>"It's time that Taipei voters had a say on whether to let a
minority party keep hijacking the majority view, " Wu said, adding
that if Soong's extremism is not accepted by Taipei citizens, "he
should leave politics for good, his PFP should disband, so that
extremism will come to an end in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Kao Chih-peng, another DPP legislator, called the PFP, created
after Soong lost his presidential bid in 2000, "the very source of
Taiwan's turmoils" without which, Kao claimed, the arms purchase bill
would have passed the legislature long ago and there would not have
been three attempts to recall President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Kao said that the upcoming vote in Taipei is a vote of confidence
on Soong and that voters should use their ballots to tell Soong where
he should be headed.</P>
      <P>"If Soong and his PFP are not accepted in Taipei, that will be a
blessing for Taiwan. Otherwise, Taiwan is doomed to disaster, " he
claimed.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lee Chun-yi said he is concerned that if Soong and
Ma keep working together toward "something, " the DPP will be in
opposition for 20 full years.</P>
      <P>William C.T. Lai, another DPP legislator, also demanded that if
Taipei voters veto Soong's mayoral bid this time, Soong should quit
politics so that "rationality can prevail again in the legislature."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's information technology (IT)
industry need to create new value for its products in the face of
intense global competition, Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, while continuing to improve their
manufacturing technology and lower their costs, it is very important
for the IT manufacturers to seek to raise the added value of their
products through research and development and the establishing of
quality and prominent brand names.</P>
      <P>Tsai made the remarks while addressing a forum on innovation
strategies for the technological and operational models of the IT
industry. The event was held by the Ministry of Economic Affairs in
cooperation with the Chung Hua Institution for Economic Research.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's status in the world's technological
development is becoming increasingly important with the joint efforts
of the government and private sector, Tsai said the annual production
value of the country's photonics industry topped NT$1 trillion for
the first time in 2005, following a similar achievement by the
semiconductor industry a year earlier.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is also performing well in terms of technological
innovation with the expansion of the production value of the IT
industry, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>For example, Taiwan ranked fourth and fifth in 2006 in terms of
technological infrastructure and scientific infrastructure,
respectively, among a total of 61 economies surveyed by the
Swiss-based International Institute for Management Development, Tsai
pointed out.</P>
      <P>In 2005, Taiwan obtained the fourth largest number of patents in
the United States for the seventh consecutive year, while Taiwan
ranked second in the world in terms of the number of patents granted
per million people, she said.</P>
      <P>For the same year, Taiwan obtained 820 patents in the United
States for inventions in the field of semiconductor technology,
ranking it third in the world behind only the United States and
Japan, Tsai said, adding that Taiwan also obtained the world's third
largest number of patents for inventions in the field of liquid
crystal display technology.</P>
      <P>In terms of inventions in the field of computer hardware and
software technology, the number of patents obtained by Taiwan also
jumped from 239 in 2004 to 279 in 2005, marking a significant
increase of 16.7 percent, with Taiwan's ranking advancing from eighth
to fifth, Tsai said.</P>

      <P>Of these 841 cases, damage was caused to the aircraft in 108
cases, while in another 22 cases, the aircraft were either forced to
return soon after takeoff, give up the flight, turn back while in
mid-air or take emergency measures, with subsequent flights being
canceled or runways being closed, the report said.</P>
      <P>It said that over the last 16 years, four expensive aircraft
belonging to the ROC Air Force have crashed as a result of bird
strikes.</P>
      <P>Although no bird strike-related crashes involving civil aircraft
have been reported, airlines have suffered huge losses because of
damage caused by bird strikes to the engines or other components of
their aircraft, the report said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the report indicated that 686 of the total of 841 bird
strikes occurred during landing, and the other 132 cases occurred
during takeoff.</P>
      <P>The committee proposed that in addition to installing bird
dispersing devices, airports should also conduct bird species surveys
and work out bird strike prevention plans to ensure flight safety.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROTARY INT'L PRESIDENT PRAISES CONTRIBUTION OF TAIWAN MEMBERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Rotarians in Taiwan have made a great
contribution to Taiwan society and communities over the years, Rotary
International President William Boyd said in an interview with the
CNA Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese Rotarians donated an average of US$138 per person per
year to the Rotary Foundation, which is one of the highest figures in
the world, Boyd said on the first day of his three-day visit to
Taiwan. He added that membership in Taiwan has been growing strong,
with a 10-percent increase this past year.</P>
      <P>The most satisfying fact, according to Boyd, a New Zealander who
is visiting Taiwan for the first time, is knowing that Rotarians in
Taiwan have been helping communities and people through collaboration
with government agencies and various organizations.</P>
      <P>Boyd made the comments on the heels of an anti-drugs and
anti-AIDS campaign in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Rotary International is an organization of more than 32,000
Rotary clubs located in more than 200 countries. Its members are
known as Rotarians. The purpose of the group is to bring together
business and professional leaders who provide humanitarian service,
encourage high ethical standards in all vocations, and help build
goodwill and peace around the world.</P>
      <P>Boyd, who was invited to join the Rotary club in 1971, said he
has always been interested in helping people. Being a Rotarian has
helped him expand his vision and get involved in many international
events. As the current president, he has been able to travel with his
wife Lorna to different countries and meet different people, he said.</P>
      <P>In Uganda, Boyd met a young man who lost his arm in an accident
and was later able to make a living as a cab driver after receiving
an artificial arm, which was donated by a Rotary club and cost only
US$50.</P>
      <P>"It's amazing to see what a difference a little effort can make,"
he said.</P>
      <P>Boyd, whose term as president will end in June 2007, has made
"water, hunger and health" the three main areas for Rotarians around
the world to work on in 2006 and 2007. Stressing his philosophy of
"local Rotary clubs know best," Boyd said that he only sets a general
direction and then lets local clubs make decisions on specific areas
they want to work on.</P>
      <P>Boyd said he believes Rotary International's role will increase
in the future, adding that it is gratifying to see so many
international organizations, such as UNICEF, actively approach Rotary
International for collaborate on projects.</P>
      <P>What Rotary International can do to help the world is not limited
to its 1.2 million members, Boyd said, pointing out that several of
the organization's programs involve women and youth as well and that
Rotarians usually bring their family members along to participate in
community services.</P>
      <P>"The future of Rotary International is looking as good as ever, "
Boyd said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT DIFFERENCES SHOULD BE RESOLVED PEACEFULLY: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
cross-Taiwan Strait differences, particularly political differences,
should be resolved peacefully via dialogue between the official
leadership of the two sides, rather than through violence or other
non-peaceful means.</P>
      <P>During a visit to the Presidential Office by Bastiaan Belder -- a
European Parliament member who authored a "China report" calling for
fair treatment of Taiwan by all European Union member states -- Chen
said he was very grateful that the European Parliament has passed
many major resolutions regarding Taiwan's security concerns.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan's 23 million people should neither be isolated
from the world nor have their human rights neglected. Rather, he
said, they should have the right to pluralistic values, like all
people do around the world.</P>
      <P>He called for the international community to respect Taiwan
people's collective human rights, pointing out that it is not only a
right for the people in Taiwan to partake in global organizations and
activities, it is a responsibility to do so, as part of one global
society.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should be accepted as part of the international community
whether under the principle of universality prescribed by the United
Nations charter, or in terms of the supreme "borderless" guideline
that has been observed by the world's health and medical sectors,
Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Citing the "China Report, " which was passed Sept. 7 this year in
a majority decision by the European Parliament, Chen said he could
not agree more with the main thrust of the report, including
opposition to an E.U. resolution to lift the arms embargo on China;
firm support for Taiwan's participation in major international
organizations, including the World Health Organization; and that
controversies and differences across the Taiwan Strait should be
solved via peaceful dialogue.</P>
      <P>Chen said he salutes the European Parliament, which has vetoed
lifting the arms embargo on China in nearly 10 resolutions in the
past several years. He said once such an embargo is lifted, it would
be tantamount to encouraging Beijing to further infringe upon human
rights and facilitating arms sales to totalitarian China, which would
in turn use the arms against peace-loving Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president also conveyed his appreciation to the European
Parliament for its passage of a resolution calling for China to
remove missiles that are deployed along its southeastern coastal
provinces, targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said he would like to see China rise as a democratic country,
instead of a military hegemony.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NTUH DEVELOPS ANTI-OXIDANT WATER EFFECTIVE AGAINST FREE RADICALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7 (CNA)
(By Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese researchers have developed a
device that can transform tap water into an "anti-oxidant water, "
which has proven effective against free radical-related symptoms in
dialysis patients, sources at National Taiwan University Hospital
(NTUH) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Free radicals, such as OH, NO, ROO, H2O2, HOC1, 1O2, and NOOO,
have long proven to be health-damaging because they oxidize lipids,
destroy cell membranes, and interrupt the functions of protein and
DNA, leading to many diseases.</P>
      <P>The anti-oxidant water is laced with active hydrogen atoms, which
have been proved effective in "catching" radicals and neutralizing
the harmful particles into a more neutral substance, they said.</P>
      <P>Cheng Chien-ting -- a research fellow of NTUH's Medical Research
Department -- said the machine combines a renovated filter, an
electrochemical processor and a far infra-red apparatus to enrich
ordinary water with hydrogen atoms.</P>
      <P>Once the anti-oxidant water is absorbed into the body, the
hydrogen atoms seek to combine with radicals to stop the oxidation
process, preventing further damage caused by radicals, he said.</P>
      <P>Cheng explained that the need for anti-oxidant water became
urgent when they discovered that most patients requiring kidney
dialysis suffer from a side effect caused by the therapy, in which
the process mobilizes white blood cells and produces a large amount
of radicals.</P>
      <P>If left attended, the radicals would oxidize protein, low-
density lipoproteins and red blood cells, causing inflammation,
vessel hardening, and anemia respectively, he noted.</P>
      <P>Under the auspices of the National Science Council, NTUH's
research team collaborated with Wanhwa Hospital in Taipei City and
began clinical testing of anti-oxidant water in 2002.</P>
      <P>During a one-month observation of 37 patients, they added
anti-oxidant water into standard dialysis fluid and found the
vessel-hardening index decreased by 35 percent to 69 percent and the
inflammatory index went down by 8 percent to 12 percent.</P>
      <P>In 2005, NTUH conducted another test among 25 patients requiring
kidney dialysis, whose condition also improved after being treated by
anti-oxidant water.</P>

      <P>Despite the fact that marijuana is an
illicit narcotic in Taiwan, over 60,000 people abuse the second-grade
"soft drug, " the Department of Health's (DOH) National Bureau of
Controlled Drugs reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to bureau Director-General Chien Chun-sheng, at least
67,000 people smoked marijuana in Taiwan from 2003-2005, making it
the third most abused drug among Taiwan's youth.</P>
      <P>Although it is the Ministry of Justice's authority to decide
whether the drug should be legalized for medical treatment purposes,
Chien said that the DOH prefers not to make it a lawful substance for
fear there would be no end to the trouble if it is legalized.</P>
      <P>Abusing marijuana produces distorted perceptions and causes

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT) and People First
Party (PFP) should step up consolidation after Saturday's mayoral and
city council elections in Taipei and Kaohsiung, Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said in an interview Thursday with Asia
Television Ltd.</P>
      <P>The two parties must engage in the field in order to win back
power in 2008 by fielding a sole common candidate in the next
presidential election, Wang said.</P>
      <P>It is the desire of many in Taiwan that the KMT regain power,
Wang claimed, expressing his belief that the KMT would do its utmost
to better serve the people if it takes control of the central
government again.</P>
      <P>Wang, however, was reserved about the possibility of his own
participation in the 2008 presidential election, saying that it would
depend on the situation following Saturday's elections in the two
special municipalities. </P>
      <P>Commenting on the Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral elections, Wang
contended that Hau Lung-bin, the KMT candidate, should be able to win
the race in Taipei. But, he added, it is hard to predict the outcome
in Kaohsiung since results of most public opinion polls show tied
support for Huang Chun-ying, the KMT hopeful, and Chen Chu, the
candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Powerchip Semiconductor Corp. (PSC)
and the Japanese Elpida Memory Inc. signed an MOU in Taipei Thursday
to establish a joint facility in central Taiwan for DRAM production.</P>
      <P>When the PSC-Elpida DRAM fabrication facilities -- to be located
in the Central Taiwan Science Park -- begin commercial operations --
hopefully in four to five years -- the new joint venture will be the
world's largest 12-inch chip wafer foundry, with a total planned
capacity of 240,000 wafers per month, said PSC Chairman Frank Huang.</P>
      <P>These new DRAM fabrication facilities, carrying a pricetag of
NT$450 billion (US$13.85 billion) , would also be the largest joint
venture project in Taiwan in recent years involving domestic and
foreign companies.</P>
      <P>Huang said despite the efforts of Singapore and China to offer
attractive packages for such a large-scale investment project, Elpida
decided to choose Taiwan as the joint venture's location and to tie
up with PSC, reflecting the importance that Elpida has attached to
Taiwan's and PSC's competitiveness in terms of semiconductor
manufacturing.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the MOU signing ceremony, Yukio Sakamoto,
president and CEO of Elpida, said PSC and Elpida -- partners
cooperating perfectly over the past several years -- will strive
together concertedly, envisaging a challenge to the world's DRAM
leader status in three years.</P>
      <P>"Now it's time for us to make our move into PC DRAM production
and become the number one player in the DRAM industry, " said
Sakamoto. "We have decided to do so because we have gained
credibility for our advanced DDR2 SDRAM, which was backed up by the
high productivity at our E300 fab in Hiroshima. Moreover, we are very
confident in our 70nm process technology, soon to be in mass
production at our E300 fab. We are very happy to be able to transfer
this new technology to ramp up our new joint fab," He added.</P>
      <P>He also noted that a combination of Elpida's state-of-the-art
technology and PSC's cost competitiveness in DRAM production will
definitely translate into outstanding production capabilities in this
joint venture, supplying high quality DRAM products at competitive
prices.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's trade surplus posted in the first
11 months of this year stood at US$18.39 billion, an amount larger
than the totals for 2004 and 2005, the Ministry of Finance (MOF)
reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>The surplus might shore up Taiwan's trade surplus for 2006 to
US$20 billion, marking a three-year high, said Lee Li-hsueh, director
of the MOF's Department of Statistics.</P>
      <P>Lee quoted MOF tallies as indicating that Taiwan exported
US$19.54 billion-worth of goods and services in November, up 8.2
percent from the year-earlier level, while importing US$17.12
billion-worth of products and services, up 7.9 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINESE TAIPEI TERM RESULT OF `ONE CHINA' POLICY: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Dec.  7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian attributed
Thursday the term "Chinese Taipei" that Taiwan has to use on many
international occasions as a result of the "one China" policy adopted
by Taiwan's previous government.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a campaign rally in the southern port city of
Kaohsiung, Chen said he was asked by a visiting European Parliament
(E.P.) member earlier in the day why Taiwan athletes are taking part
in the 15th Asian Games in Doha, Qatar under the banner of "Chinese
Taipei" rather than under the national flag of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>"I told Bastiaan Belder that the ROC has been forced since 1981
to use the 'Chinese Taipei' banner in the Olympic Games and the Asian
Games and some other international activities partly because of the
'one China' policy followed by our previous government," said Chen
whose Democratic Progressive Party advocates Taiwan's separate
national identity.</P>
      <P>The president was referring to Taiwan's previous ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) which favors Taiwan's eventual unification with a
democratic China. The KMT ruled Taiwan for more than five decades
until May 2005.</P>
      <P>Belder, an E.P. member from the Netherlands who authored a "China
report" earlier this year calling for fair treatment of Taiwan by all
European Union member states, is visiting Taipei at the head of an
E.P. delegation. He met with Chen at the Presidential Office in the

ROTARY INT'L PRESIDENT PRAISES CONTRIBUTION OF TAIWAN MEMBERS</P>
      <P>Taipei, Dec. 7 (CNA) Rotarians in Taiwan have made a great
contribution to Taiwan society and communities over the years, Rotary
International President William Boyd said in an interview with the
CNA Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese Rotarians donated an average of US$138 per person per
year to the Rotary Foundation, which is one of the highest figures in
the world, Boyd said on the first day of his three-day visit to
Taiwan. He added that membership in Taiwan has been growing strong,
with a 10-percent increase this past year.</P>
      <P>The most satisfying fact, according to Boyd, a New Zealander who
is visiting Taiwan for the first time, is knowing that Rotarians in
Taiwan have been helping communities and people through collaboration
with government agencies and various organizations.</P>
      <P>Boyd made the comments on the heels of an anti-drugs and
anti-AIDS campaign in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Rotary International is an organization of more than 32,000
Rotary clubs located in more than 200 countries. Its members are
known as Rotarians. The purpose of the group is to bring together
business and professional leaders who provide humanitarian service,
encourage high ethical standards in all vocations, and help build
goodwill and peace around the world.</P>
      <P>Boyd, who was invited to join the Rotary club in 1971, said he
has always been interested in helping people. Being a Rotarian has
helped him expand his vision and get involved in many international
events. As the current president, he has been able to travel with his
wife Lorna to different countries and meet different people, he said.</P>
      <P>In Uganda, Boyd met a young man who lost his arm in an accident
and was later able to make a living as a cab driver after receiving
an artificial arm, which was donated by a Rotary club and cost only
US$50.</P>
      <P>"It's amazing to see what a difference a little effort can make,"
he said.</P>
      <P>Boyd, whose term as president will end in June 2007, has made
"water, hunger and health" the three main areas for Rotarians around
the world to work on in 2006 and 2007. Stressing his philosophy of
"local Rotary clubs know best," Boyd said that he only sets a general
direction and then lets local clubs make decisions on specific areas
they want to work on.</P>
      <P>Boyd said he believes Rotary International's role will increase
in the future, adding that it is gratifying to see so many
international organizations, such as UNICEF, actively approach Rotary
International for collaborate on projects.</P>
      <P>What Rotary International can do to help the world is not limited
to its 1.2 million members, Boyd said, pointing out that several of
the organization's programs involve women and youth as well and that
Rotarians usually bring their family members along to participate in
community services.</P>
      <P>"The future of Rotary International is looking as good as ever, "
Boyd said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>2006 R&amp;D SPENDING EXPECTED TO FALL SHORT OF 3% GDP TARGET: NSC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's overall R&amp;D spending is not
expected to reach 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) this
year, and the target may not be reached until 2015, a National
Science Council (NSC) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>NSC Vice Chairman Yang Hung-tun made the remarks after an NSC
commissioners meeting during which the results of a nationwide survey
of scientific and technological research and development in 2005 was
unveiled.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, Yang said, Taiwan's total R&amp;D spending
amounted to NT$281 billion (US$8.65 billion) in 2005, marking a
year-on-year increase of NT$17.7 billion, or 6.7 percent. The amount
was equivalent to 2.52 percent of the country's GDP for 2005, up
marginally from 2004's 2.44 percent.</P>
      <P>Judging from this trend, Yang said, the country's R&amp;D spending
will fall short of the 3 percent GDP target this year as set forth by
President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>"It is estimated that we may have to wait until 2015 to see the
realization of this goal," Yang said.</P>
      <P>In 2005, Yang said, the bulk of the R&amp;D spending came from
private enterprises, accounting for 66.9 percent of the total, higher
than the figure of 64.8 percent in 2004; with the government sector
contributing 31.5 percent, lower than 2004's 33.6 percent. The
remaining 1.6 percent of R&amp;D spending was by higher education
institutions, non-profit private organizations and foreign
institutions.</P>
      <P>Noting that none of the government agencies have seen a budget
increase in recent years, Yang said the NSC had proposed a 10-percent
increase in its R&amp;D budget for 2005, but the proposal was scaled down
by the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Another reason behind the slow increase in R&amp;D spending lay in
the lackluster results in prodding the private sector to invest more
in R&amp;D. "As a result, we have not yet attained the 3 percent GDP
target," he added.</P>
      <P>According to an NSC-drafted white paper on science and technology
development for 2007-2010, the government's R&amp;D spending will still
just amount to 0.9 percent of GDP in 2009 and only reach 1 percent in
2015, while the private sector's R&amp;D spending is estimated to amount
to 1.7 percent of GDP in 2009 and 2.5 percent of GDP in 2015.</P>
      <P>In 2005, Yang said, Taiwan had an R&amp;D work force of 115,954, up
6.5 percent from 108,891 in 2004.</P>

its arms sales ban against China anytime soon as Beijing has not yet
improved its human rights record and as the European Parliament has
yet to enact a code of conduct with regard to arms sales, according
to a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference Thursday, Soong Wen-cheng, deputy
director of the MOFA's Department of European Affairs, said the topic
about whether to lift the China arms ban is expected to be on the
agenda of the Dec. 14-15 E.U. summit.</P>
      <P>"But we don't think the discussion will lead to a conclusion
anytime soon since there has been no marked improvement in China's
human rights record and the E.U. has not yet worked out any
complementary measures, particularly a code of conduct, to cope with
the situation following the removal of the arms embargo," Soong said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the E.U. arms sales ban was imposed in 1989 in
response to China's brutal crackdown on pro-democracy student
demonstrators at Tiananmen Square in Beijing, Soong said it would be
"tantamount to encouraging China to commit further human rights
violations if the arms ban were to be lifted before Beijing took
concrete and significant steps to improve its abysmal human rights
record.</P>
      <P>Soong further said the European Union will surely formulate a
code of conduct and other regulations for its member states to follow
in striking arms deals with China once it lifts the arms sales ban.
"Since no such rules have been unveiled, we don't expect any decisive
conclusion to be reached at the upcoming E.U. summit," he added.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the recent formation of a China-friendly panel in
the European Parliament -- the E.U.'s legislative arm -- by 16
parliamentarians would bring about any negative impact on Taiwan's
substantive relations with the E.U., Soong said that given the close
economic and trade ties between China and Europe and China's
strenuous efforts to promote cultural exchanges with European
countries, including the establishment of Confucius Institutes in
several European countries to promote the Chinese language and
culture, there is nothing unusual about the emergence of such a
subgroup in the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>According to Soong, the European Parliament has traditionally had
more Taiwan-friendly members than China-friendly ones. Moreover, he
said, Europe is a stable place, and its policy toward China has been
transparent, namely, that two sides of the Taiwan Strait should
engage in dialogue, seek solutions to their disputes by peaceful
means and refrain from using military force to resolve their
differences.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH TO ENCOURAGE LABELING OF TRANS FAT CONTENT IN FOOD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 8 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) has no plans
to ban the use of trans fats in the country, but it will encourage
food manufacturers to label the trans fat content in their products
starting next year, a DOH official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The DOH will gauge public reaction toward the measure before
further deciding whether to make the labeling compulsory, according
to Weng Hsiu-chen, a section chief at the DOH's Bureau of Food
Sanitation.</P>
      <P>Weng made the remarks in response to a decision by New York City
to prohibit restaurants from using cooking oils containing trans fats
-- which are produced during the hydrogenation process of vegetable
oils and are believed to be a major cause of heart disease.</P>
      <P>Weng pointed out that a series of discussions on the issue of
trans fats have been held in Taiwan since 2001 and that in the latest
one which took place in August this year, the DOH decided to first
require oil suppliers to label the trans fat content in their
products before expanding the policy to packaged food manufacturers.</P>
      <P>In assessing the influence of fats on human health, the amount of
fats consumed must also be taken into consideration, instead of only
focusing on what kind of fat is being consumed, she said.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung said Friday that he has been accompanying DPP
Kaohsiung mayoral candidate Chen Chu during her last-minute
campaigning out of pure friendship and that this should not be
"overinterpreted."</P>
      <P>Lin, who has led a nearly secluded life since withdrawing from
politics five years ago, said that he and Chen have maintained a
friendship for 30 years and that he is simply expressing his concern
for his friend's election bid by accompanying her during the
campaigning.</P>
      <P>Lin declined to speculate on how Chen will fare in Saturday's
election, saying that it is not appropriate to do so as it may
influence voters. "The decision is for the voters to make, and we
should respect their decision," he added.</P>
      <P>A former DPP member speculated the day before that Lin's
campaigning for Chen Chu and the DPP's Taipei mayoral candidate,
Frank Hsieh, several days ago may be a sign that he is preparing to
return to the DPP as the new party chairman. The speculation was also
reported by the media.</P>
      <P>Lin responded to the reports by saying the DPP politician and the
media have overinterpreted his actions, stressing that the last thing
he is interested in doing is getting back into politics.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) is planning to begin cooperating with
local governments to create a better investment climate for
service-oriented businesses starting early next year, a CEPD
spokesman said Friday.</P>
      <P>To gain an in-depth understanding of the gap between central
government policies and practical execution by local authorities and
companies, the CEPD has begun a series of seminars with 17 local
governments to draft measures promoting the service sector, as
service-oriented businesses have become the major force driving up
Taiwan's economy, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics, the spokesman reported that revenues
generated by the service sector already accounted for 73.8 percent of
the country's gross domestic product and that some 5.8 million -- out
of a total of more than 10 million workers -- were employed in the
sector by the end of the third quarter of this year.</P>
      <P>The CEPD's ongoing efforts formed part of its action guidelines
crafted for the service industry in 2004, which focused on promoting

    <TEXT>
      <P>The New Party (NP) would consider whether to
dissolve itself if four of its Taipei city council candidates fail to
get elected in Saturday's elections, NP Chairman Yok Mu-ming said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Yok urged NP supporters to build up a sense of urgency and not
overlook the importance of the Taipei City Council election to the
party's future, and called for continued support to help the NP
continue playing a role in Taiwan's politics.</P>
      <P>Although Yok was reluctant to predict the results of the
elections, he made it clear that he would propose to discuss the
issue within the party if the four candidates -- all party elite
members -- fail to win the elections.</P>
      <P>Such an outcome would mean the NP is unable to gain public
recognition, and it must face up to the issue whether it should
continue to exist or not, Yok said, noting the NP, as a democratic
party, must deal with its future through due process.</P>
      <P>The New Party fielded Lee Ching-yuan in Wenshan and Taan
districts, Hou Kuan-chun in Wanhua and Chungcheng districts, Pan
Huai-chung in Shihlin and Peitou districts and Wang Hung-wei in
Sungshan and Hsinyi districts.</P>
      <P>The NP forms a loose "pan-blue alliance" with the main opposition
Kuomintang and the People First Party against the "pan-green camp" of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the Taiwan Solidarity
Union. It controls only one seat in the "pan-blue" controlled

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health is checking if a
brand of China-made green bean noodles containing a cancer-inducing
chemical has been imported into Taiwan, a DOH official said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Shu-kung, head of the DOH's Bureau of Food
Sanitation, five to ten Taiwan importers have imported similar
products for domestic sale.</P>
      <P>Although a preliminary investigation indicates the brand in
question has not been imported into Taiwan, the DOH is checking
importers' details to ensure the information is accurate, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>He said the DOH will make the results public as soon as the
investigation is completed.</P>
      <P>The DOH made the move in the wake of reports that "Longkuo fensi"
produced by a company in Yantai in the northeastern Chinese province
of Shandong has been discovered to contain sodium
hydroxymethylsulfinate, a chemical used as a bleaching agent for
textiles, soap and molasses.</P>
      <P>Lin Chieh-liang, a toxicologist at Linkuo Chang Hung Memorial
Hospital, noted that unscrupulous manufacturers often use the
substance to bleach rice noodles, green bean noodles or fruit to give
their products a better look.</P>
      <P>If consumed by humans, the chemical can cause headaches,
vomiting, shortness of breath and relapse of asthma, Lin said, adding
that long-time consumption of the chemical can also lead to cancer of
the digestive tract.</P>
      <P>Lin urged consumers to avoid buying rice noodles and green bean
noodles that are excessively white in color.</P>
      <P>If consumers are worried that rice noodles or green bean noodles
they bought may contain sodium hydroxymethylsulfinate, they can
soak the noodles in cool water for one hour before cooking them, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>While cooking, the pot should be left uncovered to speed up the
volatilization of the chemical, he said.</P>

      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) warned
Friday that "phantom voters" should not vote in Dec. 9 mayoral and
city council elections in Taipei and Kaohsiung because they may be
prosecuted for violating criminal law.</P>
      <P>CEC spokesman Teng Tien-you defined a "phantom voter" as someone
who does not actually reside in Taipei or Kaohsiung, but who has
registered a household in one of the two cities before Aug. 9, simply
for the purpose of voting in the elections.</P>
      <P>Teng explained that according to Article 146 of the nation's
Criminal Law, a phantom voter could face prosecution for obstructing
the correct polling results of an election.</P>
      <P>Statistics provided by the CEC earlier this month showed abnormal
increases in the number of voters in both cities, with Taipei and
Kaohsiung gaining 15,606 and 7,994 voters respectively this year,
compared with 2005.</P>
      <P>The spokesman also reminded all candidates that all campaigning
activity must cease by 10 p.m. Friday on the eve of the election, and
that no newspapers will be allowed to publish any campaign
advertisements Saturday when the elections take place.</P>
      <P>Six candidates, including three independents, are competing in
the Taipei mayoral election, while the Kaohsiung mayoral race is a
battle among five candidates.</P>
      <P>The Taipei mayoral hopefuls include former Environmental
Protection Administration chief Hau Lung-bin of the opposition
Kuomintang, former Premier Frank Hsieh of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, and People First Party Chairman James Soong, who
is running as an independent.</P>
      <P>Conspicuous among the Kaohsiung mayoral candidates are former
Kaohsiung Deputy Mayor Huang Chun-ying, nominated by the KMT; former
Council of Labor Affairs Chairwoman Chen Chu of the DPP; and
Legislator Lo Chih-ming of the Taiwan Solidarity Union.</P>

      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long
will leave for Swaziland Saturday for the 10th Taiwan-Swaziland
meeting on economic cooperation slated for Dec. 11-12.</P>
      <P>The meeting, aimed at boosting economic relations between the two

Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), the

      <P>Swaziland is one of Taiwan's key economic and trade partners in
southern Africa, with two-way trade reaching US$23.23 million in

themselves need in the future.</P>
      <P>Wang Hsiou-yen, director of the county government's Bureau of

of a pilot social welfare program conducted in a community in the
county by the Hondao Welfare Foundation.</P>
      <P>The program, which the foundation adopted from models used in
Japan and Hong Kong, calls for able-bodied elderly to extend help to
other, less fortunate elderly citizens as a form of "insurance"
should they require help themselves in later life.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the amount of time people devote to helping
others can be accumulated and registered in exchange for the same
quantity of service they might need in the future.</P>
      <P>The three-month pilot program has received a warm reaction, Wang

to Jan. 28 to demonstrate how its experts have restored more than 70
damaged paintings by the late Taiwanese artist Shyi Der-jinn.</P>
      <P>The artist left 1,500 of his paintings to the Shyi Der-Jinn
Foundation before he died in 1981 at the age of 59.</P>
      <P>The foundation, set up with an initial endowment of NT$3.5
million, became operational in 1985 but found itself lacking the
expertise to maintain the artworks.</P>
      <P>In 1988, the foundation decided to donate all the paintings by
Shyi in its possession to the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts.
The museum began to receive the paintings in 1991 but found that some
of them were damaged.</P>
      <P>At the time, the museum did not have the funds to hire art
restoration experts to repair the paintings.</P>
      <P>Through the help of the preparatory office of the National Center

      <P>Taiwan was listed on the Tier 2 Watch List in the 2006 U.S.
Trafficking in People Report published in June, primarily because it
failed to show increased efforts in fighting trafficking during the
past year, said James Husky, chief of the political section at the
American Institute in Taiwan Taipei Office.</P>
      <P>Human trafficking is seen as the modern-day slavery, which is
very different from slavery in the past, said Washington-based John
Miller, Director of U.S. State Department's Office of Monitor and
Combat Trafficking in Persons (G/TIP) , in the conference that
gathered public prosecutors, officials and law enforcers from Taipei
and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>About 800,000 people are trafficked across national borders each
year, which does not count millions trafficked within their own
countries, said Miller, whose office coordinates the U.S.
efforts in the global fight against modern-day slavery, including
forced labor and sex exploitation.</P>
      <P>Being listed on the Tier 2 Watch List means Taiwan does not
comply with the minimum standards and requires special scrutiny
because of a high or significantly increasing number of victims and a
failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts to combat human
trafficking.</P>
      <P>Miller said the "Three Ps" principle -- prevention, protection
and prosecution -- should be used when dealing with trafficking
issues.</P>
      <P>The national action plan to fight trafficking, which was
initiated by the Executive Yuan, was a great first step for Taiwan,
said Mark Taylor, Senior Coordinator for Reports of G/TIP.</P>
      <P>Legislation makes sure the traffickers will be punished, but the
implementation of the law is equally important as well, Taylor noted.</P>
      <P>Public prosecutors and officials from Taipei and Kaohsiung
mentioned the difficulties under the current system to define
trafficking cases and identify victims.</P>
      <P>"If a person ends up losing his freedom, it's a trafficking case,
"Miller said, adding that government agencies should also work with
non-government organizations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan still hopes to wrap up tourism talks
with China by the end of this year, despite the fact there is only a
short time left, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks during a seminar with a group of election
observers from Hong Kong and Macau, with less than one day to go
before Saturday's city mayoral and city council elections in Taipei
and Kaohsiung -- Taiwan's two special municipalities.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, China seems to have recently slowed its pace in
technical talks with Taiwan due to the approach of the elections, but
the MAC chairman expressed the hope nonetheless that the talks will
conclude before the end of the year if China accelerates its pace to
allow its people to sightsee in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Saturday's elections, Wu said that the polls will
mark a key turning point in Taiwan's democratization no matter what
the results will be. Every peaceful election is a victory for
Taiwan's people, he added.</P>
      <P>Democracy has turned into a key part of the everyday lives of the
Taiwan people and this goes far beyond political divergences and
ethnic differences, he said.</P>
      <P>But Wu lamented China's cool response to Taiwan's rapid
democratization and pointed out that Beijing's reluctance to face the
democratic development in Taiwan and its misconception of the
situation has become the biggest hurdle to improving bilateral
relations.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will re-activate
the mechanism for his nomination of members of the Control Yuan next
week, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, Vice President Annette Lu will serve as

      <P>Wang made the remarks on the sidelines of an international
conference on parliamentarian affairs and democratic politics
organized by the Democratic Pacific Union, a regional organization
initiated by Lu to promote democracy, peace and prosperity for
pan-Pacific countries. Chen and Lu attended the conference.</P>
      <P>Wang told CNA that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's

an old name list of Control Yuan nominees and submit a new one.</P>
      <P>Asked about a possible hopeful for the Control Yuan leadership,
Wang said it is the president's right to nominate the person he
believes is best for the position. However, he said he will give the
president his opinion if asked.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAYORAL ELECTIONS DEMONSTRATE TAIWAN'S DEMOCRACY: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that
the peaceful, rational and orderly process of the mayoral elections
for Taipei and Kaohsiung attests to the country's democracy.</P>
      <P>Noting that a lot of people have taken to the streets over the
past few months to express their disapproval or support for his
leadership, Chen said he not only has listened to their voices but
also is willing to reflect on the government's policy and make
improvements accordingly.</P>
      <P>Chen said this is a democratic achievement that strikes a sharp
contrast to the situation 30 years ago, when Taiwan's leaders used
military or police forces to crush the voices of the people.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks during an international conference
held in Taipei by the Democratic Pacific Union (DPU) on the role of
legislature in democratic politics.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Taiwan's legislature has played a critical
role in the country's democratic achievements, abrogating a number of
outdated laws and establishing a sound foundation for the rule of
law.</P>
      <P>Chen said the smooth operation of the legislature is the
cornerstone that ensures the stability and development of a
democratic society, because the legislature is the center of a
democratic system, with legislation, budgets and treaties all
requiring the approval of the legislature before they can be put into
force.</P>
      <P>While political parties can monitor the administrative branch
through their representatives in the legislature, the legislature
must not become a battleground for vicious political competition,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>Any arguments between political parties in the legislature should
be founded on national interests and the people's well-being rather
than on partisan interests, he said, adding that the purpose of the
mechanism of checks and balances is not intended to contain each
other but to prevent either party from abusing its power.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen noted that the DPU has made many achievements
since its inauguration Aug. 14, 2005, which include the establishment
of the Pacific Disaster Prevention and Control Center and the
organization of an election observation delegation for Taiwan's
"three-in-one" local elections in 2005.</P>
      <P>These achievements have demonstrated what he described as
Taiwan's "soft power" and have successfully linked together 28
countries on the Pacific Rim to form a united and strong concentric
circle, he said.</P>
      <P>He said the forthcoming establishment of the Pacific
Congressional Caucus Dec. 10 will mark an important step forward for
the DPU, as the caucus will become the largest international
congressional organization in the region.</P>
      <P>Describing the Pacific region as "the most vital territory on
earth, " Chen pointed out that the region occupies one-third of the
world's total area, is home to 40 percent of the world's population
and accounts for more than 50 percent of the world's economic
strength.</P>
      <P>Through the Pacific Congressional Caucus and the cooperation of
parliamentarians of various countries, the DPU will secure democracy,
peace and prosperity in the Pacific region and further promote these
achievements to non-DPU members and the rest of the world, Chen said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Nov.  9  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged the
prosecution authorities Saturday to investigate the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Kaohsiung mayoral candidate's alleged vote-buying,
triggering vehement accusations from KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou that
Chen has violated the election law by making allegations aimed at
spoiling a candidate's chances of getting elected.</P>
      <P>After casting his ballot in Taipei, Chen told reporters that
media reports about suspected vote-buying in Kaohsiung City are "the
greatest insult to the voters and the severest damage to Taiwan's
democracy" and he urged the prosecution to immediately investigate.</P>
      <P>In Kaohsiung, district court prosecutors summoned two drivers of
tour buses allegedly involved in the dispensing of "attendance fees"
of NT$500 (US$15.50) to participants in an election-eve rally
organized by the Huang Chun-ying campaign. Huang is the KMT nominee
for mayor.</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-mai, campaign manager of Huang's Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) rival Chen Chu, said he had evidence that a campaign
worker for Huang gave NT$1,000 to two rally participants, while
another person "hinted at them to elect No. 1 candidate" -- Huang.</P>
      <P>The Chen Chu campaign immediately filed a lawsuit with the
Kaohsiung District Court accusing the Huang campaign of vote buying.
The Ministry of Justice said the district court prosecutor's office
has started looking into the allegation.</P>
      <P>The Huang campaign followed with a counter-suit charging the DPP
candidate with false accusation.</P>
      <P>Huang himself filed another suit against President Chen
Shui-bian, claiming that the president's accusation was aimed at
scuttling his chances of winning the election -- an offense under the
election law.</P>
      <P>Ma said it was "extremely inappropriate" for a head of government
to make a "groundless" accusation against a candidate on the election
day.</P>
      <P>He also accused Chen of abusing his constitutional immunity from
prosecution in an attempt to "win elections by all means."</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Huang Yu-chen said that by "fabricating facts," the
president was "insulting voters' intelligence" and "causing the
biggest hindrance to democracy."</P>
      <P>DPP legislative caucus convener Ker Chien-ming said Huang's
campaign workers were video-recorded distributing "attendance fees"
to rally participants -- an act that he claimed could be interpreted
as vote buying and bringing "shame to Taiwan's democracy."</P>
      <P>He claimed that it was "concrete evidence" of the KMT and Ma
"racing to the bottom" and said the DPP must sue them and demand that
the Ministry of Justice report the incident to the legislature.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Bowing to cheering supporters at his
campaign headquarters, Taipei Mayor-elect Hau Lung-bin of the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) declared Saturday that what he described
as the "clean KMT" has triumphed over "the corrupt Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) " in a grueling battle in which "all of the
city's citizens" could claim victory.</P>
      <P>Hau trounced his ruling DPP rival, former Premier Frank Hsieh, by
160,000 votes after a lengthy campaign that saw candidates slinging
mud at one another as rumors of schemes and plots swirled around.</P>
      <P>"Throughout this campaign, I've been constantly smeared, " Hau
said, adding that "I always have confidence that real gold will not
be blackened and that charcoal can never become white because I
firmly believe Taipei's citizens will not accept smear strategies in
an election."</P>
      <P>Now that the election campaign is over, Hau said he will work
with people from all political camps in building a great city,
focusing on cleaning up the Danshui river, zero tolerance on crime,

able to "groom" quite a number of DPP politicians for the city
council.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lee added, Hsieh's performance as Kaohsiung mayor -- a
post he held before becoming premier -- helped DPP candidate Chen Chu
win the mayoral race in the southern Taiwan city so that the DPP can
continue to keep Hsieh's promise to "protect the city's Love River."</P>

chairman of the opposition People First Party (PFP) to run in
Saturday's Taipei mayoral election as an independent, announced that
he would bow out of politics after yet another election trouncing.</P>
      <P>Soong made the announcement at 6 p.m. before the completion of
the vote count, which showed that Hau Lung-bin of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) had been steadily in the lead, with Frank Hsieh of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) trailing behind and
Soong not even in the running.</P>
      <P>"I respect the choice of the Taipei citizens and I gladly accept
my defeat," he said.</P>
      <P>"I'll pursue my future with my wife by my side," he added.</P>
      <P>Soong said that during the campaign, he had examined the city's
problems in the hope of getting the chance to serve the residents, a
hope that was dashed by his dismal showing in Saturday's polls.</P>
      <P>The former Taiwan provincial governor said that during the past
three decades in politics, he has taken every post as a
responsibility and challenge and has always prided himself on being a
"can-do man."</P>
      <P>Soong left his campaign office shortly after delivering his
remarks, with his supporters urging him to stay in politics and run
in the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Vice Legislative Yuan Speaker David Chung of the PFP claimed that
voters "were positive about Soong's performance, " but put him behind
Hau because they were worried that Hsieh would win.</P>
      <P>He described Soong as an "asset of the nation" and claimed that
the public "will not be able to accept" his departure from the
political scene.</P>
      <P>But Soong's coterie said that before Soong threw his hat into the
ring, he had said the mayoral election would be his "last battle."</P>
      <P>Soong ran unsuccessfully in the 2000 presidential election as an
independent, when he split the KMT vote, assuring President Chen Shui

to become the first female municipality head in Taiwan's history.
</P>
      <P>"The hard-won victory is a confidence vote for former Kaohsiung
Mayor Frank Hsieh as well as me, " Chen said after she won by a
razor-thin margin of 1,114 votes against her rival Huang Chun-ying of
the main opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>She credited Hsieh for laying a solid foundation for Kaohsiung,
saying that the public owes Hsieh and that it is time to "return him
justice and extend him warmth."</P>
      <P>She said that Hsieh, who unsuccessfully represented the DPP in
the Taipei mayoral election, fought a brilliant battle that also
helped her own campaign.</P>
      <P>Although basking in the triumphant atmosphere, she said however
that the joy should not be longer than one minute as she knows the
tremendous responsibility and public expectations that lie ahead.</P>
      <P>At a time when the DPP's popularity has slipped to its lowest ebb
due to a series of corruption scandals implicating the family of
President Chen Shui-bian and his close aides, Chen Chu had to fight
an uphill battle with a big pre-poll margin between her and her
rival.</P>
      <P>Observers attributed her success to an excellent campaign team,
which smoothed out feuds in the primary and bridged the differences
between various factions.</P>
      <P>She also solicited former acting Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai to
serve as the campaign manager and received support from Hsieh's team.</P>
      <P>Apart from turning foes into friends, she also used
her personal charisma, stressing her devotion to Taiwan's democratic
development since the Formosa Incident of 1979 -- a peaceful rally to
mark World Human Rights Day that turned violent and for which she was
imprisoned.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of the election campaign, supporters of the
"pan-green camp" of the DPP and the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
worried that Lo Chih-ming of the TSU would split the vote and tried
to persuade Lo to bow out, but when Lo insisted on running,
Chen's team adopted an undermining strategy to put him out of the
race.</P>
      <P>Chen's staff said the final week in the runnup to Saturday's
election had been crucial, with President Chen, Premier Su
Tseng-chang, revered former DPP Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung and various
other DPP heavyweights all converging on Kaohsiung to stump for her.</P>
      <P>A Dec. 3 "hand-in-hand" rally around the Love River also played a
part in boosting her momentum, resulting in a nearly 70 percent
turnout rate. A higher turnout rate was helpful to the DPP in the
election, as Kaohsiung has traditionally been the party's stronghold.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian is pleased with the
outcome of the just-concluded mayoral elections in Taipei and
Kaohsiung -- the country's two largest cities, Premier Su Tseng-chang
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks after the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP) candidate, Chen Chu, narrowly won the crucial mayoral
election in southern port city of Kaohsiung, while the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) candidate, Hau Lung-pin, won comfortably
in the capital of Taipei.</P>
      <P>"I have informed the president of the electoral results via
telephone. The president is pleased with the outcome and grateful for
all DPP comrades' campaign efforts and support from members of the
public toward the DPP candidates, " Su said, adding that the
president looks forward to a quick return to "business as usual" in
the wake of the hotly contested elections.</P>
      <P>Su will soon leave for Gambia to attend the Dec. 15 inauguration
of Gambian President Yahya Jammeh as President Chen's special envoy.</P>
      <P>He said he takes it as great honor to attend Jammeh's
inauguration on behalf of the president.</P>
      <P>Chen Chu bested KMT candidate Huang Chung-ying by 1,114 votes
out of almost 800,000 cast, in a result expected to help boost the 
position of embattled President Chen.</P>
      <P>The two mayoral elections had been seen by some pundits as a
referendum on Chen's presidency.</P>
      <P>However, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun dismissed that view, saying
that the elections should not be regarded in such a perspective.</P>
      <P>In Taipei Hau beat the DPP's Frank Hsieh by about 13 percentage
points with all the votes counted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KAOHSIUNG WIN GIVES DPP CHANCE TO REGROUPBy S.C. ChangCNA Staff Writer</HEADLINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P> The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) managed to retain
its power base in the southern port city of Kaohsiung, while its
candidate for Taipei mayor, although he lost the race, was able to
snatch over 40 percent of the vote Saturday, giving the party a
chance to regroup in the midst of a political crisis triggered by a
string of corruption scandals involving members of the first family.</P>
      <P>After badly losing the local government elections of 2005, in
which the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) snatched even Chiayi City,
the DPP has aimed to retain its power base in southern Taiwan and
Kaohsiung was a bridgehead it could not afford to lose.</P>
      <P>As President Chen Shui-bian has claimed, Saturday's polling was a
vote of confidence in former Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh's
administrative performance -- the city's citizens gave the DPP's
nominee Chen Chu a narrow win over the KMT's Huang Chun-ying.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who was recruited as premier by Chen Shui-bian before
running for Taipei mayor, also managed to get 40 percent of the
capital city's vote, more than the 36 percent won by Lee Ying-yuan,
the DPP's previous candidate to challenge Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, an
indication that a moderate and forward-looking DPP aspirant can still
win the swing vote in Taipei.</P>
      <P>DPP insiders said Saturday's vote results in Taipei and Kaohsiung
signify that the DPP is gradually emerging from the dark clouds
caused by one after another corruption scandals involving the
president's senior aides and family members as well as Cabinet- level
officials.</P>
      <P>Senior DPP officials noted that 2006 was "a year of crisis" for
the party because the first family's suspected involvement in the
"state affairs fund" scandal and former DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh's
anti-corruption campaign shook the confidence of many of the party's
staunch supporters.</P>
      <P>"Keeping Kaohsiung gives us a breather, " they claimed, adding
that their insistence on "party unity" has won endorsement from a
substantive section of the voters.</P>
      <P>But other party members pointed out that the DPP's support rates
had been dropping from 29 percent in mid-2005 to 18 percent prior to
the local elections that year, further dipping to 15 percent in the
aftermath of corruption scandals this year, indicating that a large
number of middle-class supporters have turned their backs on the
party.</P>
      <P>Political pundits noted that the DPP's popularity has never
exceeded 35 percent, and Chen Shui-bian was able to win the 2000 and
2004 presidential elections because middle-class voters who were
disgruntled with the KMT had voted for him, and so losing their
support would be quite devastating for the party.</P>
      <P>From that perspective, the DPP leadership may no longer ignore
calls for "serious reform" which will be a critical indicator of
whether the party will be able to make a new start, they said.</P>
      <P>For the KMT, the latest vote serves as a reminder that southern
Taiwan was still out of its reach even though its rival has been
bogged down by corruption charges.</P>
      <P>And KMT leaders could not hide their shock that the DPP's Hsieh
has managed to break through the 40 percent benchmark in Taipei, the
"pan-blue alliance's" stronghold.</P>
      <P>The KMT was quite demoralized that its chances of winning
Kaohsiung was dashed and its sure win of Taipei was not as big as had
been anticipated.</P>
      <P>"Boosting the KMT's morale will be Chairman Ma's major work"
after he steps down as Taipei mayor Dec. 25, if he wants to stage a
good campaign for 2008, said party insiders.</P>
      <P>With PFP Chairman James Soong announcing he will leave politics
for good after losing his mayoral bid, Ma is the sure top leader of
the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT, PFP and New Party -- a position
from which he will have to prove himself a serious contender for the
nation's top job.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Saturday that
although many emerging democracies face challenges from remnants of
their previous authoritarian regimes, democratic values and ideals
will prevail so long as assiduous efforts are devoted to
consolidation of democratic systems.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks in a speech delivered at the opening of an
international seminar on the role of the legislature in democratic
politics sponsored by the Democratic Pacific Union (DPU) , which was
founded in Taipei in August 2005.</P>
      <P>Noting that globalization has spurred freer flow of not only
population, money and merchandise but also ideas and notions, Lu said
democracy has emerged as a basic universal value in the 21st century.</P>
      <P>As an inefficient or corrupt government tends to impede
democratic reform, Lu said emerging democracies, including Taiwan,
should continue pulling out all the stops to consolidate their
democratic systems.</P>
      <P>While mass rallies and street protests may ignite waves of
democratic movement, Lu said the consolidation of democracy requires
visions and wisdom.</P>
      <P>"We need a visionary legislature in the pursuit of democratic
consolidation and overhaul of political system, " said Lu who once as
a legislator for three years.</P>
      <P>During her stint as a lawmaker, Lu said she came to a full
understanding that the legislature must play the role of "public
conscience." Under the principles of division of power, Lu said the
legislature should strictly oversee government operations and the
allocation of government budget.</P>
      <P>To promote cooperation among parliaments in Pacific rim
countries, Lu said a Pacific Congressional Caucus will be formed
under the DPU this Sunday. The establishment of the caucus will mark
an important step forward for the DPU, as the caucus will become the
largest international congressional organization in the region.</P>
      <P>"We hope the caucus will function well to contribute to the
consolidation of democracy in the Pacific region which would in turn

    <HEADLINE>MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS GIVE DPP BREATHER AFTER CRISIS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The just-concluded municipal elections in
the country's two largest cities gave the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) a breather after being dogged by corruption
scandals swirling around the first family for several months, a
political pundit said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Professor Emile Sheng from Soochow University in suburban Taipei
made the remarks after the DPP managed to retain its grip in its
traditional stronghold -- the country's second largest city of
Kaohsiung -- in Saturday's mayoral election.</P>
      <P>Although the DPP resoundingly lost, as expected, to the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) in the mayoral race in the capital city
of Taipei -- the KMT's main support base -- the number of votes
captured by its candidate Frank Hsieh surpassed the benchmark 40
percent.</P>
      <P>Sheng said the electoral outcome would allow embattled President
Chen Shui-bian to recoup its popularity after the "special state
affairs" debacle and the DPP to stop its downward streak triggered by
voter discontent over corruption scandals involving members of the
first family and some administration officials.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the municipal elections, in which the DPP-led
"pan-green" camp saw a slight expansion of its presence in the city
councils of the two special municipalities, Sheng predicted that
Premier Su Tseng-chang will remain in the post in the foreseeable
future and may emerge as the front runner in the race for the
"pan-green" camp candidacy for the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Turning to the post-election situation of the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People Fist Party (PFP), Sheng
said the KMT's narrow loss in Kaohsiung would deal a blow to KMT
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's reputation.</P>
      <P>"It's really disappointing that the 'pan-blues' failed to win the
mayorship in the DPP's traditional heartland in a political milieu so
unfavorable to the DPP," Sheng said, adding that the failure has hurt
Ma's reputation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Sheng said the PFP Chairman James Soong's decision to
quit politics after receiving a mere 4.1 percent of the total in the
Taipei mayoral election will help limit the impact of the latest
election defeat to the party, which also performed poorly in
councilor elections in both cities.</P>
      <P>In contrast, professor Wang Yeh-li of Tunghai University said he
believes that the election setback could enhance the possibility of
the PFP's disintegration or accelerate its merger with the KMT.</P>
      <P>For his part, Hsu Yung-ming, an associate researcher with
Academia Sinica, questioned the propriety of the KMT's plan to file a
suit to invalidate the DPP candidate Chen Chu's narrow victory in the
southern port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>"Our memory of the 'pan-blue alliance' filing two lawsuits
against the results of the 2004 presidential election remains vivid.
A vote recount didn't find irregularities in the vote nor change the
result of the election. The 'pan-blue' ticket of then-KMT Chairman
Lien Chan and PFP Chairman James Soong owe all of us an apology," Hsu
said.</P>
      <P>Lien and Soong teamed up to challenge President Chen and Vice
President Annette Lu's re-election bid in 2004, but lost by a
razor-thin margin. They also lost both suits challenging the validity
of the Chen-Lu ticket's electoral victory and even the validity of
the election. Neither of them has ever apologized for the money and
energy spent on the vote recount and relevant judicial procedures.</P>
      <P>Hsu said he keenly hopes that the KMT can refrain from taking any
controversial moves to continue nightmarish partisan bickering that
has long gripped local political scenes.</P>
      <P>Voter turnout in the just-concluded elections was about 67
percent in Kaohsiung with a population of about 1.6 million, and 64
percent in Taipei which boasts a population of 2.6 million.</P>
      <P>Six candidates vied for Taipei mayor, and five contenders sought
the job in Kaohsiung. Taipei victor Haul Lung-bin enjoyed a
comfortable lead when he declared himself victor at 7 p.m. before
voting results were final. Hau eventually won 692,085 ballots,
outnumbering his closest rival, the DPP's Hsieh, by more than 160,000
votes.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung winner Chen Chu, also a former Council of Labor Affairs
chairwoman and once a prisoner of conscience, said experience would
set her apart.</P>
      <P>"I have participated in every step of Taiwan's democratic
development history," Chen said shortly before the vote. "Only if you
have a sense of history can you understand this land from your
heart."</P>
      <P>Chen Chu garnered 379,417 ballots, compared to KMT hopeful Huang
Chun-ying's 378,303 votes.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung District Court approved
early Sunday the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Kaohsiung mayoral
candidate's application for impounding all ballot boxes to facilitate
probes into his election lawsuit aimed at invalidating the electoral
outcome announced a day earlier.</P>
      <P>A court judge is scheduled to visit the Kaohsiung Election
Commission at 10: 30 a.m. in the company of the losing KMT candidate
Huang Chun-ying's representatives to seal up all ballot boxes, the
name list of eligible voters and vote counting reports furnished by
all polling stations.</P>
      <P>Huang's campaign applied for impounding all ballot boxes late
Saturday after some of its volunteers overseeing vote count
procedures at various polling stations claimed that the figures
announced by the election commission diverged from those presented by
polling stations and many of Huang's votes were counted as "invalid"
simply because they were slightly tainted by ink.</P>
      <P>The court originally ruled that Huang's campaign should present
more evidence in five days to back up its "irregularity" claims.</P>
      <P>After KMT Legislator Chiu Yi led two volunteers responsible for
vote count supervision to testify at the court, the presiding judge
approved the "impounding" application.</P>
      <P>Huang lost to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's)
Chen Chu by a mere 1,114 votes, according to the Kaohsiung Election

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian exhorted the
country Sunday to resume work now that Taipei and Kaohsiung municipal
elections are over.</P>
      <P>Chen was asked by a reporter whether he is planning to "move to
Kaohsiung" as he had promised Kaohsiung voters while stumping for
ruling democratic Progressive Party mayoral candidate Chen Chu
several days ago. Chen said that if Chen Chu wins the Kaohsiung
mayoral race, he and his wife would move to the southern port city to
live. Chen Chu won the race Saturday, with a razor-thin margin over
her opposition Kuomintang rival Huang Chun-ying.</P>
      <P>The president just smiled and declined to answer the reporter's
question.</P>
      <P>Chen attended the opening of a seminar on archive decipherment
and historic truths sponsored by Academia Historica -- a national
institute under direct administrative supervision of the president,
where archives on the Republic of China's history are kept, as well
as records of the nation's major, important historic incidents.</P>
      <P>Addressing the event, Chen said over the past six years, the
government has striven to decode and study historical documents on
major political cases or incidents in an effort to recover historical
evidence and reestablish historical truths.</P>
      <P>Chen said the actions may have temporarily disturbed the
country's harmony, but he has insisted that such work must continue
so the country's social justice can be restored, historic wounds
healed and long-term national development secured.</P>
      <P>He added that if historical truths cannot be brought into broad
daylight, past wrongdoings will never serve as reminders and historic
wounds and rifts will not pass away as time goes by. Instead, these
historical mysteries will remain a source of hatred, continuing to
divide the country if not properly tackled.</P>
      <P>Academia Historica was founded in 1914 and was reestablished in
Taiwan 43 years later. It is responsible for preserving documents and
conducting research on modern Chinese history, particularly the
republican period.</P>
      <P>The academy has a collection of 7.5 million publications and
national records, mainly from the Presidential Office, the Executive
Yuan, provincial and local governments, plus some personal and other
archives. Most records are open to Academia Historica staff and

      <P>According to the Bureau of Investigation under the Ministry of

      <P>Efforts made by publicly run agencies to

commendable, Environmental Protection Adminsitration (EPA) officials
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>EPA officials said 11 Cabinet-level agencies -- including the

first half of this year, in terms of using and procuring
environmentally friendly products or "green products," which cut down
on waste and pollution, use less raw materials, conserve resources
and are recyclable, EPA officials said.</P>
      <P>To take the lead in environmental protection efforts, the Cabinet
set a 2006 goal whereby 80 percent of procurement made by
governmental agencies will be green products, EPA officials said.</P>
      <P>"Green" procurement by governmental agencies as a whole totaled
NT$3.464 billion in the January-June period, an increase of NT$26
million over the year-earlier level, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Only three Cabinet-level agencies, including the Ministry of
Education, have not performed so successfully in this area and thus
have room for improvement, they added.</P>
      <P>For the next year -- when the government's "green procurement"
will target 83 percent -- more public agencies, including the
Presidential Office, Legislative Yuan, Judicial Yuan, Examination
Yuan and Control Yuan, will also be included in the "green
procurement" and "green consumption" initiative, starting Jan. 1,
2007, the EPA officials said.</P>
      <P>Privately run companies and private organizations will also be
required to jump on the bandwagon Jan. 1, 2007, they noted.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition
People First Party (PFP) called a news conference Sunday to voice
firm support for party Chairman James Soong, urging him to continue
leading the party despite his announcement to withdraw from politics
after losing in Saturday's Taipei mayoral election.</P>
      <P>Cheng Chin-ling, the PFP's legislative caucus whip, issued the
call at the Legislative Yuan while accompanied by PFP lawmakers --
including Liu Wen-hsiung, Lin Hui-kuan, Daniel Hwang, Lin Chung-te
and Fu Kun-chi. Also present were Legislative Yuan Deputy Speaker
David C. Chung, a PFP member, and PFP Secretary-General Chin
Ching-sheng.</P>
      <P>Cheng deplored Soong's failure in the Taipei mayoral elections
and ascribed Soong's loss to voters' "dump and save" tactic to avoid
a split in the "pan-blue alliance" and secure the victory of Hau
Lung-bin, the candidate of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), in
the face of competition from Frank Hsieh, a former premier and rival
from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Although Soong announced following the elections that he would
pull out of the political sector, Cheng said that all PFP lawmakers
hope Soong will change his mind and continue leading the party. They
also urged PFP Vice Chairman Chang Chao-hsiung to now serve as acting
chairman to maintain the party's normal operations.</P>
      <P>Chung and Chin also praised Soong as an outstanding politician
and voiced regrets over his decision to pull out of politics, saying
that it will be a great loss to Taiwan and its people.</P>
      <P>However, PFP spokesman Lee Hung-chun admitted that it will be
very hard for Soong to change his mind. He called on Chang to hold
off his decision to follow Soong's lead and instead stay in the party
to help overcome its current obstacles. The PFP should continue its
cooperation with the KMT in the legislature, he said.</P>
      <P>Soong garnered 53,281 votes, or 4.14 percent of the total, in
Saturday's Taipei mayoral election, ranking behind Hau's 692,085
votes (53.81 percent) and Hsieh's 525,869 votes (40.89 percent.)</P>
      <P>The PFP and the KMT form a loose "pan-blue alliance" that also

a symposium Dec. 12 on investment and technological cooperation with
Israel, after bilateral trade between the two countries exceeded US$1
billion last year for the first time, a ministry spokesman said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>The symposium will be held at National Taiwan University's
international conference center, and aims to help Taiwanese
enterprises gain a better understanding of Israel and seek
collaboration and commercial opportunities in the Mideast country,
the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>In this symposium, Israeli officials as well as Taiwanese
entrepreneurs and business experts who have conducted business with
Israel will be invited to participate in discussion on Israel's
investment climate, the development of its high-tech industry and
key characteristics of its culture and trade, according to the
spokesman.</P>
      <P>He added that Israel has earned the reputation of a second
"Silicon Valley," with 100 companies listed on the NASDAQ, and that
it has become an international hub for technological cooperation and
multinational investment, the spokesman said, adding that the main
international corporations, such as Intel, IBM and Microsoft have all

      <P>The opposition Kuomintang's (KMT)
legislative caucus said Sunday it would take a hands-off approach
toward the decision of KMT Kaohsiung mayoral candidate Huang
Chun-ying to file a lawsuit aimed at invalidating Saturday's election
results, in which Huang lost to his rival by a razor-thin margin.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chin-lung, party whip of the KMT's legislative caucus, said
the caucus respects Huang's call on Saturday for all ballot boxes in
Kaohsiung city to be impounded -- as a means to facilitate his
lawsuit, which aims to invalidate the election results -- but that it
will not exert any further pressure on the prosecution on the matter.</P>
      <P>Early Sunday, the Kaohsiung District Court approved Huang's
request to impound all ballot boxes to facilitate probes into his
election lawsuit.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the case has now entered the judicial process and the
KMT legislative caucus will do nothing further in this regard.</P>
      <P>Huang lost to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP)
Chen Chu by a mere 1,114 votes. Chen got 49.41 percent of the vote,
or 379,417 votes, while Huang obtained 49.27 percent, garnering
378,297 votes -- the narrowest margin in Taiwan's history between the
two camps in special municipality elections.</P>
      <P>Huang's campaign applied for the impounding of all ballot boxes
late Saturday after some of its volunteers who were overseeing
vote-counting procedures at various polling stations claimed figures
announced by the election commission diverged from those presented by
polling stations, claiming many of Huang's votes were counted as
"invalid" simply because they were slightly tainted by ink.</P>
      <P>The court originally ruled that Huang's campaign should present
additional evidence within five days to back up its claims of

Kuomintang (KMT) candidate for Kaohsiung mayor who lost by a mere
1,114 votes to ruling party rival Chen Chu Saturday, said Sunday he
had "not yet lost" the election and still has a good chance of
winning.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by lawyer Ho Hsu-ling at the Kaohsiung Election
Commission, Huang told reporters he will file a lawsuit to dispute
the election results, claiming "chances are I will win the election."</P>
      <P>The lawyer was scheduled to file suit Monday, when the court will
likely set a time to recount ballots that were cast and counted at
839 polling stations across the city.</P>
      <P>All valid and invalid ballots, voter registrations and
vote-counting records were sent to the election commission in the
morning, under police escort.</P>
      <P>Representatives of Huang's and Chen Chu's campaigns were present
as six judges and several election officials sealed the ballots and
other relevant papers.</P>
      <P>Initial witness reports indicated that a certain candidate's vote
gain had been inflated, and that some votes were proclaimed invalid
due to "excessively stringent" confirmation standards.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Chiu Yi, who was also present at the election
commission, said that preserving the evidence is the most difficult
part of an election dispute.</P>
      <P>Chiu praised the on-duty judges for making a "wise" decision soon
after the Huang campaign had filed a request to seal ballot boxes
late Saturday.</P>
      <P>He said more than 6,000 invalid votes were counted for Huang --
an unreasonably large number. Inferring from the 2004 presidential
elections in which about one-tenth of the invalid votes could be
"validated," Huang's vote gain could be 600 or more.</P>
      <P>In addition, irregularities were allegedly found at more than 10

      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
lamented Sunday opposition People First Party (PFP) Chairman James
Soong's announcement to withdraw from politics, calling it "a great
loss" to the country and its people.</P>
      <P>Wang made the comments one day after Soong announced he would be
leaving Taiwan's political scene after having lost Saturday's mayoral
election in Taipei. Soong had 53,281 votes, or only 4.14 percent of
the total, ranking third among five candidates.</P>
      <P>Hau Lung-bin, candidate of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT),
won the lion's share with 53.81 percent, or 692,085 votes, in the
Taipei mayoral race. Frank Hsieh, a former premier and candidate of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), came second with 40.89
percent, or 525,869 votes.</P>
      <P>Wang, a KMT heavyweight, expressed his belief that KMT Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou would seek to mend bilateral relations with the PFP in
the near term, and that the PFP will try to adjust its pace following
its defeat in the Taipei mayoral and city council elections.</P>
      <P>As there are still nearly two dozen PFP lawmakers serving in the
Legislative Yuan and some of the party's members have still managed
to get elected in Taipei and Kaohsiung city council elections, the
KMT needs to show respect for the PFP in terms of future cooperation,
Wang said.</P>
      <P>The PFP controls 22 seats in the 220-member Legislative Yuan, but
only two PFP candidates were elected in the 52-member Taipei city
council elections, down from eight who were elected four years ago.</P>

      <P>The government will soon launch a
"mega-development project" aimed at transforming eastern Taiwan's
agricultural and tourism industry while ensuring the quality of life

Development (CEPD) announced Sunday.</P>
      <P>The project, formally known as the "Eastern Taiwan Sustainable
Development Plan," is expected to be in the pipeline beginning Monday
when the CEPD convenes its first meeting on the project.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, the government will invest some NT$50 billion
over nine years to transform the eastern corridor -- from Yilan
County's Nanao and Tatung rural townships to Hualien and Taitung
counties -- into an international-standard tourism area, conserving
eastern Taiwan's natural beauty while building an environment with a

      <P>Specifically, the project will feature developing the tourism
industry in the corridor's rural townships; developing an industrial
processing zone for deep-sea products; promoting an "immigration"
program to build new tribal villages in the area; developing a
cottage industry-based economy; bolstering railway and multiple
transportation systems; and reviewing the existing policy of
transporting sand and gravel from east to west Taiwan, according to
CEPD officials.</P>
      <P>The project -- initiated by former Premier Frank Hsieh in August
2005 and put on the drawing board in February this year with Su

    <HEADLINE>PFP VICE CHAIRMAN SHOWS NO WILLINGNESS TO RETAIN POST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  10 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>People First Party (PFP) Vice Chairman
Chang Chao-hsiung remained unmoved Sunday despite PFP lawmakers'
calls for him to reverse his decision to resign from his post, in the
wake of PFP Chairman James Soong's announcement a day earlier that he
would quit politics.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng Chin-ling, the PFP's legislative caucus whip,
Chang remained firm in his intention to resign from the post, despite
party lawmakers' efforts to retain him.</P>
      <P>Soong announced Saturday following his defeat in the Taipei
mayoral election that he accepted the voters' judgment, and that he
would pull out of Taiwan's politics altogether. Soong, once a
powerful politician, gained more than 50,000 votes in the race, only
4.14 percent of the total.</P>
      <P>Cheng made the comments following a meeting over the issue
between Chang, a group of PFP lawmakers and David J. C. Chung, a PFP
member and Legislative Yuan vice speaker.</P>
      <P>Although PFP lawmakers tried hard to persuade Chang to stay and
help maintain the party's normal operations, Cheng said that the
party vice chairman's decision about quitting the post remained
unchanged.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, Chung and PFP lawmakers asked Chang to
continue leading the party and also promised to demand Soong continue
to serve as party chief. They contended that the PFP should continue
collaborating with the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) at the
Legislative Yuan in future, as the PFP still controls 22 seats in the
220-member legislature.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the two parties would still form a formal political
alliance as it has been reported, Cheng said that they are working
toward that direction, but added that the KMT "holds the key."</P>
      <P>It was reported that Soong and the KMT Chairman had met for four
hours prior to Saturday's elections in a closed-door, late-night
meeting to discuss the two parties' future collaboration in the
legislature and to form a formal political alliance -- an alignment
different from the loose "pan-blue alliance" that comprises the two
parties and the New Party.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Soong has no public activities scheduled and has
rejected all visits.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP ON BRINK OF CRUMBLING AFTER LOSING ITS CHAIRMANBy Han Nai-kuoCNA Staff Writer</HEADLINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P> Taiwan's second largest opposition party, the People First Party
(PFP), is on the brink of crumbling after its chairman, James Soong,
bowed out of politics Dec. 9 following a defeat in the Taipei mayoral
election.</P>
      <P>Soong, who founded the PFP almost single-handedly in 2000 after
losing the presidential election by a narrow margin, received some
50,000 votes, or a little more than 4 percent, in the election --
lower than the 5 percent threshold necessary to get his NT$2 million
deposit back. He was defeated by Hau Lung-bin, candidate of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT), who captured 53.8 percent of the vote.</P>
      <P>Soong's failure was a sharp contrast to late 2000, when he ran as
an independent in the presidential election while a member of the
opposition Kuomintang at the time. Although he failed that year, he
won 4.6 million votes nationwide -- about 37 percent of the popular
vote.</P>
      <P>That stunning performance prompted him to form the PFP, which
captured 46 legislative seats in 2001 elections with 19 percent of
the ballots cast, followed by winning eight seats in the Taipei City
Council election in 2002.</P>
      <P>Even when the PFP's legislative seats dropped to 34 in the 2004
legislative elections, the party still managed to secure 17 percent
of the vote in the capital city of Taipei.</P>
      <P>Soong's humiliating defeat in the Taipei mayoral election Dec. 9
was coupled with the party's defeat in city council elections in
Taiwan's two largest cities. Only two PFP members won Taipei city
councilor races, while four others won elections for Kaohsiung city
councilor.</P>
      <P>Soong's sudden departure leaves the PFP headless, with no clear
direction in the party's future. There is no one in the party who
could take over the chairmanship and fill Soong's large shoes.</P>
      <P>Political analysts have blamed Soong himself for turning a blind
eye to PFP supporters' fervent hope that the PFP be merged with its
"pan-blue alliance" partner, the KMT, after Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou
became KMT chairman in July 2005.</P>
      <P>Like the KMT, the PFP is against Taiwan independence and
champions eventual reunification with China. The party has maintained
a close working relationship with the KMT in the legislature, but the
relationship has been tense sometimes, especially in election years,
because the two parties must compete for support from the same
voters.</P>
      <P>It has been the common wish of pan-blue alliance supporters that
the KMT and PFP become one stronger, united party that challenges the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>When their hope could not be realized, and when compelled to
choose between the PFP and the KMT, most of the PFP's past supporters
switched allegiance to the KMT in the Dec. 9 elections.</P>
      <P>The PFP will become increasingly immaterial in Taiwan's politics
and appears destined to fade into history. Some of the 22 PFP
legislators have acknowledged they are seriously thinking of leaving
the PFP and joining the KMT, because failing to do so, they will have
very little chance of getting re-elected in legislative races next
year.</P>
      <P>The 2007 election will use a "single-member constituency,
two-vote system," with the number of legislators slashed from 225 to
113 and their term extended from three years to four. The new system
will be extremely unfavorable to small political parties, including
the PFP.</P>

the Taiwanese Association of America's Dallas-Fort Worth Chapter, as
part of a series of events marking the association's founding.</P>
      <P>The celebrations gathered some 100 members from its branches

who established the association in New York in 1976.</P>
      <P>The association also discussed Taiwan media in a meeting earlier

objective in news-gathering and avoid fabrication so as to protect
people's basic human rights.</P>
      <P>Wang said the association was founded to help political prisoners
and their family members, and now works toward safeguarding basic

      <P>Based on this consideration, Wang noted in future the

    <HEADLINE>DPP CAUCUS SUGGESTS PARTY HEAVYWEIGHTS WORK TOWARD PARTY UNITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.   10  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Members of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP) legislative caucus called on the party's
"four heavyweights" Sunday to sit down and discuss how to achieve
party unity now that the party has weathered another election crisis.</P>
      <P>Chen Ching-chun, caucus secretary-general, made the call after
DPP candidate Chen Chu won the Kaohsiung mayoral race by a razor-thin
margin Saturday, retaining a power base for the party that has been
dogged by a string of corruption scandals over the past months.</P>
      <P>If the party's key figures -- Vice President Annette Lu, Premier
Su Tseng-chang, Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and former Premier Frank Hsieh
-- try to jockey for an advantageous position with only a view toward
becoming the party's presidential candidate in 2008, people would
feel disillusioned, he said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who ran on the party ticket for Taipei mayor, lost the
election but managed to snatch over 40 percent of the vote -- a
prowess some analysts said shows he is a potential contender for the
next presidency.</P>
      <P>Lin Cho-shui, who recently quit his legislative seat in protest
over the party's inaction on the corruption scandals, suggested the
four heavyweights sit down to discuss whether to launch the
presidential nomination process early so the party would have enough
time to prepare for the next big fight.</P>
      <P>Kao Chih-peng, a DPP lawmaker in the "[pro-]Chen Shui-bian
faction, " said primaries for next year's legislative elections and
2008 presidential elections could be held simultaneously, but whether
the timetable should be moved forward needs further discussion.</P>
      <P>Chen Ching-chun said just-concluded municipal elections in Taipei
and Kaohsiung are not a prelude to the 2008 race, which will be
decided more by what the ruling party can achieve in the coming 18
months than by the emergence of the party's candidate.</P>
      <P>"If President Chen has a poor administrative record for the
remainder of his term, whoever will be running on the DPP ticket in
2008 will face an uphill battle," he said.</P>
      <P>William C.T. Lai, another DPP legislator, said it matters little
whether a party candidate is chosen early or late; what really
matters is that the candidate is chosen by consensus and in the
interest of harmony, something that can only be achieved if party
heavyweights demonstrate their wisdom.</P>

The release of the report by the bipartisan

A document that many in Washington had hoped

among the party's four "heavyweights, " namely Vice President Annette
Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang, Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and former Premier
Frank Hsieh.</P>
      <P>He reasoned that producing a DPP presidential candidate early
would not necessarily prevent these "heavyweights" from competing.
Besides, he said, if a DPP presidential candidate were to be named
too early, the candidate would unavoidably become the target of smear
campaigns and mudslinging by the opposition camp, adding that such a
development would also be detrimental to the DPP administration's
operations at the same time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BUSINESSES SHOULD THINK GLOBALLY: THINK TANK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  11  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In a time of globalization, Taiwan
businesses should not confine their investments to "just a certain
part of the world, " the head of a local think tank said Monday,
referring to China.</P>
      <P>Chen Po-chih, chairman of the Taiwan Thinktank, made the remarks
at a seminar sponsored by the Industrial Development Bureau under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>He noted that some media is exploring why Taiwan's economic
performance lags behind that of South Korea and attributes some of
the reasons to the government's China investment restrictions on
certain sectors, but said he disagrees with that view.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed that the key to the gap between Taiwan and South
Korea lies in the fact that Seoul is seeking to be No. 1 in the
world, while Taiwan businesses are content to be No. 1 only in China.</P>
      <P>Chen said there are a lot of opportunities to make money in China
and that Taiwan businessmen should seize those opportunities.</P>
      <P>But he also said that not every Taiwan business makes money,
citing the example of manufacturers of notebook computers. Since they
have been allowed to invest in China, their profits have not seen a
dramatic increase, showing that "going west" is no guarantee of
profits, he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan businesses should not blame the government's cross-Taiwan
Strait trade policy for their failure to make money, he added.</P>
      <P>With the ratio of Taiwan's exports to China higher than that of
South Korea's to China, Chen said the reason Taiwan's industry and
profits lag behind South Korea is because Taiwan businesses look only
at how to make money from the gap between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>"They fail to focus on building a fortress of knowledge, so that
they are easily surpassed by their rivals," he said.</P>
      <P>He added that some businesses, such as Taiwan's
DRAM and flat panel businesses, which have not gone to China, have
developed better than their South Korean counterparts.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out the fallacy of some Taiwan businesses that
think they are incapable of competing globally, but at the same time
believe that they can win if they invest in China.</P>
      <P>Moreover, in the midst of the free flow of goods and capital,
businesses should realize that if they cannot widen the knowledge gap
between them and their rivals, they could fall quickly, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Legislator Trong R. Chai has decided to propose a bill at the end of
the month to promote his idea of relocating the capital city from
Taipei in northern Taiwan to the central area of the island.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative caucus whip Yeh Yi-jin praised Monday the plan as
a positive move for national development, explaining that judging
from the perspective of geography, it is "even-handed" for the
central government to place its headquarters in the central area of
the country.</P>
      <P>Tsai announced the proposal a day earlier in a press release
along with several of his colleagues. He revealed that the proposal
has won the support of over 70 lawmakers and that he has therefore
decided to present the bill to the legislature in late December. If
the bill fails to clear the Legislative Yuan, Tsai said, he will push
for a referendum on the issue.</P>
      <P>In the press release, Tsai argued that Taipei's economic
development has greatly outpaced that of other Taiwan cities in the
central and southern regions, adding that relocating the capital
would help in efforts to balance development in the country.</P>

      <P>The Legislative Yuan Judicial Committee
approved Monday after a preliminary review a draft bill calling for
the establishment of associate judges in courts to help facilitate
the process of lawsuits involving intellectual property disputes.</P>
      <P>Associate intellectual property rights (IPR) judges, if installed
in courts, could provide professional consultations to judges, ask
questions or offer explanations on behalf of the judges and assist in
investigations to help judges handle IPR lawsuits, which otherwise

      <P>Taiwan should consider opening direct
trade, postal and transportation links -- better known as "three
direct links" with China conditionally, the head of a think-tank said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Po-chih, chairman of the Taiwan Thinktank, said that from
the perspective that "the world is flat, " Taiwan should consider
opening direct links -- particularly direct air links -- with China
if three prerequisites can be secured.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan should launch direct air links with China if the
nation's dignity can be upheld, if Beijing promises not to interfere
in Taiwan's efforts to forge free trade agreements with other

      <P>He made the remarks during a speech he delivered at a seminar

against the "world is flat" trend, in which multinational companies

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has
followed international norms in dealing with an application for
Republic of China nationality from a Pakistani man married to a
Taiwanese woman, a MOFA official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The official made the remarks after Legislator Lu Shiu-yen, the
Taiwanese woman Tsou Shih-yung and her Pakistani husband called for
attention to the difficulties of the Pakistani man in obtaining ROC
nationality.</P>
      <P>Tsou said that after they married in Taiwan, the MOFA told them
to go to Pakistan to register their marriage and get it authenticated
by the Pakistan Embassy in Saudi Arabia because Taiwan does not
maintain diplomatic relations with Pakistan. They have spent
NT$200,000 (US$6.060) in getting the marriage certificate and getting
it authenticated, but have received no response from MOFA since
submitting the relevant documents in mid-June.</P>
      <P>Lu said that apart from Chinese spouses, ROC law stipulates that
foreign spouses of Taiwan nationals have the right to apply for ROC
nationality. However, the ministry said that since Pakistan is "a
terrorist country," screening of Pakistanis should be more rigorous.</P>
      <P>Chen Shan-you, an official of MOFA's Bureau of Consular Affairs,
said Pakistan is not friendly toward Taiwan while friendly to
terrorists.</P>
      <P>The international community generally adopts a strict manner in
verifying the identity of Pakistani people, Chen said, claiming that
the delay was caused by the "slow authentification" by the Pakistan
Embassy in Saudi Arabia.</P>
      <P>But he also said that Chien Kang-tan, director-general of MOFA's
Bureau of Consular Affairs, has instructed him to continue the
rigorous screening but to also take the individual case into
humanitarian consideration.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Consular Affairs has asked its representative
office in Saudi Arabia to help with the authentication and
verification and should get the results in three days, he added.</P>

President Yahya Jammeh.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks at a legislative committee when Legislator

with diplomatic protocol to send an envoy at such short notice.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian announced last month that Vice President

decided to designate Su as his special envoy because of Lu's busy

      <P>Legislator Huang Wei-cher of the ruling Democratic Progressive
asked if the itinerary could have unexpected twists and turns, given
the fact that the premier's plans to visit other countries have twice

      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) stands firm
on its stance of continuing to collaborate with the People First
Party (PFP) and will not back out of a cooperation agreement it
reached with the PFP, KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Monday.</P>
      <P>Ma made the comments after attending a public charity activity
while answering questions from reporters about the reported accord
that the two parties signed prior to the Dec. 9 mayoral and city
council elections in Taipei and Kaohsiung -- Taiwan's two special
municipalities.</P>
      <P>According to a China Times report, Ma and PFP Chairman James
Soong inked an accord Nov. 28 to form a political alliance and step
up bilateral cooperation after the municipal elections. But Ma
regretted clinching the pact and asked to meet Soong again Dec. 1 in
a meeting that was leaked the following day, the report said.</P>
      <P>Saying that the KMT does not regret having cooperated with the
PFP, Ma added that his meetings with Soong were aimed at reaching a
consensus on continued collaboration between the two parties.</P>
      <P>But he argued that it is wrong to view their meetings as "secret"
or "closed-door" and claimed that he and Soong did not sign any
formal documents, although they agreed to keep on cooperating.</P>
      <P>"The KMT is very sincere about the promise that it made to the
PFP and it will not change its position in this regard," Ma repeated,
stressing that his party will make pubic any formal accords that it
inks through due process with the PFP.</P>
      <P>The KMT and the PFP already form a loose "pan-blue alliance" that
also includes the New Party against its rival "pan-green camp" of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the Taiwan Solidarity Union.</P>
      <P>PFP spokesman Lee Hung-chun urged the two "pan-blue" partners
later that day to rebuild mutual trust and establish a formal
alliance as soon as possible after the Saturday's elections to meet
the high expectations of supporters for "pan-blue" unity.</P>
      <P>Although Soong has announced his intention to quit the political
scene following his hammering in the weekend Taipei mayoral race, Lee
said that 22 PFP lawmakers still serve in the Legislative Yuan and
that they are the PFP's most valuable asset as they form a key
minority in the 220-member legislature.</P>

bickering through the media, Lee said, adding that the PFP is looking
forward to quickly beginning talks over the issue with the KMT.</P>
      <P>Although the PFP is now at a disadvantage due to Soong's
announcement last Saturday that he is to quit politics, Lee pointed
out that the PFP is still an independent political party. It still
has some 20 lawmakers serving at the 219-member Legislative Yuan and
they are the key to guaranteeing a "pan-blue" legislative majority,
he noted.</P>
      <P>The PFP caucus in the Legislative Yuan will continue to operate
normally and the party has no plans to elect a new party chairman,
Lee said.</P>
      <P>Soong said that he would retire from politics last Saturday after
conceding defeat in the Taipei mayoral election. He earned just over
58,000 votes, or 4.14 percent of the total, ranking a distant third
among the six candidates.</P>
      <P>The once powerful Soong set up the PFP in 2000 after losing the
presidential election to President Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic
Progressive Party.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER HOPES TO VISIT CHINA IN SPRING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Monday that he hopes to visit China next spring in an attempt to help
mend bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>In a meeting with reporters, Wang said he has been seeking the
opportunity to make such a trip for the past five or six years and
that it is now more probable that he will be able to realize the trip
early next year.</P>
      <P>He declined to provide any further details, saying that the time
is not yet ripe.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he will vie for the presidency in the 2008
election, Wang said he was "unable" to assess the possibility at
present, but he said he was planning to meet main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong in the coming days.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, a KMT heavyweight, he will discuss issues
related to a quicker screening of a presidential nomination list of
Control Yuan members at the Legislative Yuan, while also trying to
persuade Soong to remain in the political arena.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a long-stalled law amendment that will allow direct
transport links between Taiwan and China, Wang contended that it is
no good to ram the controversial bill through the legislature despite
the fact that the KMT and the PFP together command a majority at the
219-member Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Soong announced last Saturday that he would retire from politics
after conceding defeat in the Taipei mayoral race earlier the same
day.</P>
      <P>Soong gained only around 58,000 votes, or 4.14 percent of the
valid ballots, placing him a distant third among the six candidates.</P>
      <P>The KMT, the PFP and the New Party are partners in the "pan-blue
alliance" -- rivals of the "pan-green camp" of the ruling Democratic

    <HEADLINE>COMMUNITY MENTAL HYGIENE CENTER INAUGURATED IN TAIPEI COUNTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 11 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei county government inaugurated a
community mental hygiene center Monday to offer help to those on the
brink of suicide or who are suffering from other mental disorders.</P>
      <P>The center was opened after five members of a family of six in
Taipei committed suicide one after another in less than four months,
suspectedly due to economic factors. The tragedy shocked society and
made the front pages of several newspapers.</P>
      <P>At the opening ceremony, Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei
said suicide has become the sixth-most-common cause of death in
Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Chou said the county government has already set up a telephone
hotline to offer counseling to those in need.</P>
      <P>Tai Chuan-wei, deputy director of the Cabinet-level Department of
Health (DOH) suicide prevention center, noted that family members are
the best people to find out if someone is suicidal.</P>
      <P>Citing the example of the six-member family, in which the father
and his adult daughter jumped into a river in August, Tai claimed
that if more people show concern to other members of their families,
"tragedies would not occur again."</P>
      <P>The mother of the family killed herself and her two sons Sunday,
jumping into the same river where her husband and daughter died.</P>
      <P>Tai said he had high expectations for the mental hygiene center.</P>
      <P>According to Tai, the people most likely to attempt suicide are
in the 16-24 age group, with most suicide deaths occurring among the
elderly.</P>
      <P>Chiang Hung-chi, deputy executive officer of the DOH's suicide
prevention center, noted that some 45 percent of suicides had
revealed their intention in advance. However, 70 percent of family
members believed they were not serious, Chiang added.</P>
      <P>Chiang urged families and friends not to ignore threats of
suicide.</P>
      <P>According to government statistics, the World Health Organization
(WHO) has listed depression as one of the three biggest diseases of
the 21st Century, with suicide the ninth-most-common cause of death
in Taiwan last year.</P>
      <P>Hsu Ming-neng, director of the Taipei county government's Health
Department, said the mental higiene center will held seminars and
related activities to allow the public to better understand various
mental diseases and teach them techniques to relieve stress.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INTERNATIONAL FORUM ON ANIMAL WELFARE HELD IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  11 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>People's attitude toward animals has
changed over time, especially in the last 10 years, but Taiwan still
faces barriers that impede the practice of animal protection,
scholars said in an international forum Monday.</P>
      <P>"Animal protection is a policy that cannot be delayed," said
Chen Shei-saint, chairman of the Animal Protection Association (APA)
of the Republic of China at the opening ceremony of the 2006
International Companion Animal Welfare Forum.</P>
      <P>The two-day forum, co-organized by the APA, Life Conservationist
Association and the Department of Veterinary Medicine at National
Taiwan University, is taking place in Taipei with scholars from 11
countries meeting in a "dialogue between Taiwan and the World."</P>
      <P>David Fraser, a Canadian professor at the University of British
Columbia who also works for the Office International des Epizooties
(OIE, World Organization for Animal Health), offered a global
perspective on animal welfare in a keynote speech.</P>
      <P>It is amazing how quickly people's opinion could change in
30 years toward animals, Fraser noted, adding that the animal
protection movement is looking for a more global reach in the 21st
century.</P>
      <P>However, there are new challenges ahead, including the rising
production of meat -- especially in developing countries; the human
impact on wildlife species, and increasing cases of domestic animals
living in human communities, Fraser said.</P>
      <P>Briefing the audience on the animal protection movement in
Taiwan, Shih Chao-hwei, a Buddhist nun, followed up Fraser's
viewpoints with her concerns.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's animal protection movement has a long way to go, said
Shih Chao-hwei, a professor at Hsuan Chuang University.</P>
      <P>"The [animal protection] law in Taiwan has been in place. All we
need now is the improvement of law enforcement. Too many times we
have allowed unlimited generalizations of cultural diversity, tourism
and sacred sacrifice to impede the practice [of animal protection] in
Taiwan," she said.</P>
      <P>Twelve theses will be presented at the forum.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taichung, Dec.  11 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu returned to work
at the Taichung city government Monday after spending 22 days at Chi
Mei Medical Center in Tainan County receiving treatment and
accompanying his wife, Shirley Shao, who was seriously injured in a
Nov. 18 car accident.</P>
      <P>Hu thanked city council speaker Chang Hung-nien and other council
members for their support in helping him and his wife tide through
their ordeal.</P>
      <P>He termed progress in his wife's recovery as "a miracle" and
expressed gratitude to all who have prayed for her and sent their
best wishes.</P>
      <P>Shao, who has not fully recovered from her injuries, is still at
Chi Mei Medical Center.</P>
      <P>She lapsed into a coma after the accident and remained in an
intensive care unit for 18 days. A medical team performed two
surgical operations, amputating her left forearm and a ruptured
spleen. Five days ago, she was able to open her eyes and utter a few
syllables. Doctors determined she was no longer in critical condition
and allowed her to stay in an ordinary ward.</P>
      <P>The mayor compared his wife's condition to "a lightbulb that
turns on and off because there isn't enough electricity."</P>
      <P>He added that his wife is "off" more often than she is "on."</P>
      <P>Queried by reporters about the possibility of a photo opportunity
with his wife, Hu said news media should not expect to see her for at
least six months.</P>
      <P>Hu disclosed that starting Dec. 13, China Medical University
Hospital in Taichung will take over the job of providing patient care
and undertaking rehabilitation work for his wife.</P>
      <P>Asked how he felt about the driver of the car who had tried to
overtake them on a freeway shoulder and caused his chauffeured
minivan to overturn, Hu said he bore no grudge against that young
man.</P>
      <P>"I hope his life has returned to normal and that he would obey
traffic rules and drive carefully in future," he said.</P>
      <P>Later Monday, the Taichung City Council invited the mayor to a
ceremony to light up a Christmas tree in the plaza in front of the
council -- not only to greet the festive holiday, but also to
celebrate the mayor's return to work and to pray for his wife's early
recovery.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nobel prize-winning scientists encouraged
Taiwan students Monday to remain curious about the world around them,
while also cultivating a concern for political and social affairs.</P>
      <P>During a rare question-and-answer session at an international
seminar in Yilan, northeastern Taiwan, Taiwan high school and college
students were excited to have the opportunity to ask questions of six
Nobel laureates gathered in part to celebrate the 70th birthday of
Dr. Lee Yuan-tseh, the former president of Academia Sinica.</P>
      <P>Wei Yu-shu, a sophomore at Taichung First High School, asked the
top scientists if a laser that captures atoms could control the
atoms' movement. Other students asked the scientists when they had
made the resolution to become a scientist, or if they had ever
thought of changing their job after winning the Nobel prize.</P>
      <P>Dodley Herschbach, who had served as Lee's lab research advisor,
said he came from a farming background and was the first member of
his family to attend college, and that he hadn't become interested in
science until entering university.</P>
      <P>German-born John Polanyi was born to a family of scientists. He
said he naturally joined their ranks, even though his father had not
asked him to become one, asking him instead to care about politics
and society.</P>
      <P>Polanyi added that he enjoyed sharing his findings with other
people, and also hoped to hear constructive suggestions from others.</P>
      <P>John Fenn of Virginia University, an octagenarian, and Caltech
Professor Rudolph Marcus, the 1992 Nobel prize winner of chemistry,
encouraged young students to remain curious about everything in the
world.</P>
      <P>Steven Chu, who won a Nobel prize in 1997, said he practices what
Fenn and Marcus had advised and has always remained curious about all
things. Chu said the Nobel prize gives him a chance in public
service.</P>
      <P>Lee advised students not to be dejected by criticism that their
findings "look stupid."</P>
      <P>"Marcus' finding was called 'stupid, ' too, but 20 years later it
was proven right," he said.</P>
      <P>Some of the students were nervous when meeting in person with
these international figures, asking questions in a quivering voice.
But as for Taichung's Wei, he said he could understand 70 percent of
what was said in their lectures.</P>
      <P>"These masters expanded my scope. I admire their truth-seeking
spirit, " he said, determined that he will follow in their footsteps
on the path of scientific research.</P>
      <P>The seminar was sponsored by the Academia Sinica's Institute of
Atomic and Molecular Sciences with some enterprises co-sponsoring.</P>

      <P>Senior government officials said Monday it
is not yet time for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to
consider when to hold its presidential primary election and whom to
nominate as the party's presidential and vice presidential
candidates.</P>
      <P>In response to media queries about DPP legislative caucus whip
Ker Chien-ming's call for an early decision to nominate the DPP's
presidential and vice presidential hopefuls, Presidential Office
Deputy Secretary-General Cho Jung-tai said a rush or hurry is
"unnecessary."</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan held mayoral and city council elections in
Taipei and Kaohsiung only two days go, Cho said, "The DPP should not
give the impression that the purpose of its existence is solely
elections."</P>
      <P>Cabinet spokesman Cheng Wen-tsan echoed Cho's remarks when asked
to comment on media reports that Premier Su Tseng-chang and former
Premier Frank Hsieh form the best ticket for the DPP in the 2008
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that now is the time for Taiwan's society to
recuperate from the Dec. 9 elections.</P>
      <P>"The people expect the DPP to do a good job, and there is no need
to hurry on fielding candidates for the next elections," he said.</P>
      <P>In the Dec. 9 elections, DPP candidate Chen Chu was elected
Kaohsiung mayor. Although the party's candidate for Taipei mayor,
Frank Hsieh, was defeated by opposition Kuomintang candidate Hau
Lung-bin, he garnered more than 40 percent of ballots cast against
Hau's 53 percent, making him one of the presidential hopefuls for the

    <HEADLINE>NOBEL LAUREATES ENCOURAGE TAIWAN'S STUDENTS TO 'STAY CURIOUS'(repeat)</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nobel prize-winning scientists encouraged
Taiwan students Monday to remain curious about the world around them,
while also cultivating a concern for political and social affairs.</P>
      <P>During a rare question-and-answer session at an international
seminar in Yilan, northeastern Taiwan, Taiwan high school and college
students were excited to have the opportunity to ask questions of six
Nobel laureates gathered in part to celebrate the 70th birthday of
Dr. Lee Yuan-tseh, the former president of Academia Sinica.</P>
      <P>Wei Yu-shu, a sophomore at Taichung First High School, asked the
top scientists if a laser that captures atoms could control the
atoms' movement. Other students asked the scientists when they had
made the resolution to become a scientist, or if they had ever
thought of changing their job after winning the Nobel prize.</P>
      <P>Dodley Herschbach, who had served as Lee's lab research advisor,
said he came from a farming background and was the first member of
his family to attend college, and that he hadn't become interested in
science until entering university.</P>
      <P>German-born John Polanyi was born to a family of scientists. He
said he naturally joined their ranks, even though his father had not
asked him to become one, asking him instead to care about politics
and society.</P>
      <P>Polanyi added that he enjoyed sharing his findings with other
people, and also hoped to hear constructive suggestions from others.</P>
      <P>John Fenn of Virginia University, an octagenarian, and Caltech
Professor Rudolph Marcus, the 1992 Nobel prize winner of chemistry,
encouraged young students to remain curious about everything in the
world.</P>
      <P>Steven Chu, who won a Nobel prize in 1997, said he practices what
Fenn and Marcus had advised and has always remained curious about all
things. Chu said the Nobel prize gives him a chance in public
service.</P>
      <P>Lee advised students not to be dejected by criticism that their
findings "look stupid."</P>
      <P>"Marcus' finding was called 'stupid, ' too, but 20 years later it
was proven right," he said.</P>
      <P>Some of the students were nervous when meeting in person with
these international figures, asking questions in a quivering voice.
But as for Taichung's Wei, he said he could understand 70 percent of
what was said in their lectures.</P>
      <P>"These masters expanded my scope. I admire their truth-seeking
spirit, " he said, determined that he will follow in their footsteps
on the path of scientific research.</P>
      <P>The seminar was sponsored by the Academia Sinica's Institute of
Atomic and Molecular Sciences with some enterprises co-sponsoring.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Senior government officials said Monday it
is not yet time for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to
consider when to hold its presidential primary election and whom to
nominate as the party's presidential and vice presidential
candidates.</P>
      <P>In response to media queries about DPP legislative caucus whip
Ker Chien-ming's call for an early decision to nominate the DPP's
presidential and vice presidential hopefuls, Presidential Office
Deputy Secretary-General Cho Jung-tai said a rush or hurry is
"unnecessary."</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan held mayoral and city council elections in
Taipei and Kaohsiung only two days go, Cho said, "The DPP should not
give the impression that the purpose of its existence is solely
elections."</P>
      <P>Cabinet spokesman Cheng Wen-tsan echoed Cho's remarks when asked
to comment on media reports that Premier Su Tseng-chang and former
Premier Frank Hsieh form the best ticket for the DPP in the 2008
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that now is the time for Taiwan's society to
recuperate from the Dec. 9 elections.</P>
      <P>"The people expect the DPP to do a good job, and there is no need
to hurry on fielding candidates for the next elections," he said.</P>
      <P>In the Dec. 9 elections, DPP candidate Chen Chu was elected
Kaohsiung mayor. Although the party's candidate for Taipei mayor,
Frank Hsieh, was defeated by opposition Kuomintang candidate Hau
Lung-bin, he garnered more than 40 percent of ballots cast against
Hau's 53 percent, making him one of the presidential hopefuls for the
2008 race.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ELECTION COMMISSION REBUTS VOTE-RIGGING ALLEGATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Dec. 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung Election Commission (KEC)
rebutted Tuesday opposition accusations that the just-concluded
mayoral election was rigged.</P>
      <P>Chen Pao-teh, a KEC section chief, said the voting and vote count
procedures in Saturday's mayoral election were transparent and
closely supervised.</P>
      <P>"It is simply not likely that any major mistake occurred in the
vote count process, nor is it likely that any election staff
deliberately rigged the process," Chen Pao-teh said.</P>
      <P>He was responding to opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Chiu
Yi's allegation that the number of ballots garnered by ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate Chen Chu at No. 160
polling station was "474" rather than "747" as tallied in the final
count.</P>
      <P>"The accusation was ill-motivated and completely unfounded," Chen
Pao-teh said, adding that the figure reported to the KEC and the
Central Election Commission was exactly "474."</P>
      <P>As to the opposition's claim that a family with five eligible
voters received seven voting notices, including two for the borough
chief elections to be held later this month, Chen Pao-teh said it was
purely a case of negligence and didn't have any effect on the mayoral
election result.</P>
      <P>"A voting notice could hardly be used to rig an election. A voter
can never receive a ballot at a polling station simply with a voting
notice. Voters must produce their ID cards to get blank ballots. So
long as you have your ID card, you can receive a ballot, even if you
don't have a voting notice," Chen Pao-teh explained.</P>
      <P>In Saturday's hotly contested mayoral election, Chen Chu narrowly
defeated the KMT candidate, Huang Chun-ying, by a mere 1,114 votes.
Huang has filed a lawsuit demanding that the courts invalidate the
outcome on the basis that legal infractions occurred.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung District Court has impounded all the ballot boxes
for a possible vote recount.</P>
      <P>Chen Pao-teh said that all the ballot boxes have been sealed up
and subject to strict round-the-clock monitoring. "They won't be
unsealed until after the court decides on whether to hold a vote
recount," he added.</P>

      <P>Defeated Kuomintang (KMT) candidate for
Kaohsiung mayor Huang Chun-ying lambasted the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Tuesday for "setting up" a vote-buying scheme
to sabotage his campaign, vowing he will persist to the end in his
lawsuit against the perpetrators.</P>
      <P>Huang lost by a paper-thin margin of 0.14 percent of the valid
votes to his DPP rival, former Labor Affairs Minister Chen Chu, in
Saturday's municipal election.</P>
      <P>Huang said the rival camp "designed a delicate hoax" to allege
that his campaign workers tried to bribe participants attending the
election eve rally.</P>
      <P>Chen Chu campaign held a late night press conference to spread
the rumor Friday, followed by President Chen Shui-bian's voting day
allegation that under such suspicions, even if Huang won the vote,
his election would be invalid, Huang said.</P>
      <P>"The president was evidently trying to influence voter behavior,
a move that was extremely immoral," Huang claimed.</P>
      <P>As his campaign has sued the DPP manipulators over the
vote-buying allegation, he urged the judicial authorities to speed up
investigation and find the fact quickly.</P>
      <P>"Only truth will clear my name and return justice to Kaohsiung's
one million voters, " he said, adding that Taiwan deserves a "clean"
election environment.</P>
      <P>Partly because of this incident, he has filed another election
lawsuit to request a recount of the vote aimed at invalidating Chen's

      <P>The quit smoking hotline service center

junior and senior high schools to help students kick the habit in
light of the increasing number of teenage smokers, an official said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Lien-chang, deputy director of the service center, pointed

smoking by giving them demerits, a method which he said is

transfer students who smoke to the center for five quit smoking
counseling sessions via telephone, with each session lasting 30
minutes to 50 minutes, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Statistics from the bureau indicate that although the number of
smokers in Taiwan declined from 4.89 million in 2002 to 4 million in
June this year, the number of teenage smokers has been increasing.</P>

of Taiwan journalists exchanged views with scholars from the
Weatherhead East Asian Institute of the prestigious university on
U.S.-China-Taiwan relations.</P>
      <P>Tung noted that China slowed down its pace in terms of engaging
in talks with Taiwan prior to the Dec. 9 municipal elections in
Taipei and Kaohsiung, but now that the elections are over, which saw
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) retain its hold on
the southern port city of Kaohsiung, he believes that a "window
of opportunity" has opened for such talks between now and July 2007.</P>
      <P>Noting that legislative elections will be held in Taiwan at the
end of next year and the presidential election will be held in March
2008, Tung said that if there is no substantial progress in
cross-strait talks before July 2007, then China could again slow down
its pace on cross-strait engagement because of considerations of
election-related factors.</P>
      <P>Columbia University professor Lu Xiaobo said that China has
enhanced its understanding of Taiwan. After the Taipei and Kaohsiung
municipal elections, many in China have adopted a more pessimistic
view regarding Ma Ying-jeou, Taipei mayor and chairman of the
main opposition Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>China is not sure whether Ma, the most likely bet to be the
candidate of the KMT in the 2008 presidential election, will win the
race, Lu said, adding that China has lowered its expectations for the
"pan-blue alliance" led by the KMT.</P>
      <P>Lu also said that China has not completely ruled out the
possibility of the pro-independence DPP retaining power in the 2008
presidential election despite the fact that a series of recent
alleged corruption scandals involving family members of President
Chen Shui-bian and his senior aides have dented the DPP's popularity.</P>
      <P>However, China has no idea who will succeed President Chen within
the DPP camp, nor is it sure of the future cross-strait policy of the
DPP, Lu said.</P>
      <P>For this reason, Lu said he believes that China will not take any
rash actions prior to 2008.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's airline industry recorded 28
accidents involving fixed-wing aircraft between 1996 and 2005, with a
total of 467 people killed in seven of these accidents, according to
tallies released Tuesday by the Cabinet's Aviation Safety Council
(ASC).</P>
      <P>The number translates into an accident rate of 2.1 per million
departures, which is lower than the accident rate of 2.17 per million
departures recorded for the 1995-2004 period and 2.82 per million
departures recorded for the 1994-2003 period, ASC officials said.</P>
      <P>However, the world's total air accident rate for the 1996-2005
period was 0.89 per million departures, which means that there is
much room for improvement for Taiwan's flight safety, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>Of the 28 air accidents, 13, or 46.4 percent, occurred during
landing, they said.</P>
      <P>While the aircraft swerved off the runway in seven cases, six
accidents occurred during rainy days and another five happened during
typhoons, they said.</P>
      <P>The officials said that in addition to poor weather conditions,
the air crew's failure to follow standard operational procedures or
their lack of understanding of the aircraft system were responsible
for most of the accidents.</P>
      <P>According to the ASC, 88 percent of the air accidents recorded by
Taiwan's airline industry over the past 10 years were due to human
error, 42 percent were related to environmental factors, and 19
percent were related to problems with the aircraft.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  12 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) demanded Tuesday that main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou apologize if President Chen Shui-bian's vote-buying
allegations against the KMT candidate in the Dec. 9 Kaohsiung mayoral
race were true.</P>
      <P>DPP Deputy Secretary-General Tsai Huang-liang and Public
Relations Department Director Mong I-chao issued the call at a news
conference at DPP headquarters after the KMT ran an advertisement in
newspapers charging Chen of seeking to influence the Saturday mayoral
election by making such remarks earlier that same day.</P>
      <P>Tsai and Mong asked Ma to resume political responsibility and
offer a public apology to Kaohsiung residents should the vote-buying
allegations filed by the DPP camp against Huang Chun-ying, the KMT's
defeated hopeful, be proven true.</P>
      <P>Now that relevant evidence has been given to prosecutors, the KMT
should stop provoking social confrontation and wait for the final
judgment of the judiciary, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Tsai also claimed the Huang camp's lawsuits against Chen Chu, his
DPP rival and now Kaohsiung mayoral-elect, was only part of its
efforts to smear the DPP in a bid to cover its vote-buying for Huang
by passing the buck to Chen Chu.</P>
      <P>Huang said earlier the same day that he will hold on to the last
minute until his name has been cleared by court. He lashed out at the
DPP for orchestrating the scheme to make him lose the election.</P>
      <P>Huang challenged Chen Chu Monday to hold a new election if her
vote-buying accusation against himself is proved to be a plot staged
by Chen Chu's camp.</P>
      <P>Huang's campaign has lodged a suit against Chen Chu after her
campaign made public a videotape on the eve of Saturday's elections
showing that a man suspected to be Huang's campaign was giving money
to rally attendants while soliciting votes for Huang aboard a bus.</P>
      <P>Huang lost the race to Chen Chu by a slim margin of 0.14 percent,
or just 1,114 votes.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, who doubles as mayor of
Taipei, vowed to examine the party's worse-than-expected results from
the Dec. 9 mayoral and city council elections in Taipei and Kaohsiung
in Wednesday's weekly meeting of the Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>Ma said that he will also review his own responsibility as KMT

      <P>Shish offered some tips to avoid violating the law, saying that
the public should refrain from complying with requests to carry

    <HEADLINE>NO IMPROVEMENT IN CHINA'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.12 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China's human rights record not only saw
little improvement in the past year, it even worsened, contrary to
its excellent performance in pushing for economic development,
according to a human rights report released Tuesday by the
Taipei-based Taiwan Foundation for Democracy (TFD).</P>
      <P>In the TFD 2006 China Human Rights Report, six scholars released
results of their observations on China's human rights performance in
the fields of society, politics, judicature, economic environment as
well as education and culture, in the one-year period between July 1,
2005 and June 30.</P>
      <P>TFD Vice President Tung Li-wen stated that in 2006 Beijing
authorities and some enterprises in China were seen as notorious for
their pressure on workers' "right-defending" movement, saying based
on news reports from overseas media outlets over the past year, there
were more than 20 incidents in China where police arrested or
assaulted laborers protesting to defend their working welfare and
level of wages.</P>
      <P>China needs to allow workers to organize their own independent
unions that can work to safeguard the working rights of their
members, Tung suggested.</P>
      <P>In politics, Chen Chu-ju, an assistant researcher of the
Institute of International Relations at National Chengchi University,
said she found that with increasing social conflicts triggered by
increasing economic development, the communist authorities have
enacted stricter measures to press down on the human rights of the
people.</P>
      <P>While taking severe steps to crack down on human rights defenders
and advocates, Beijing further strengthened its control over freedom
of press and speech, as well as the Internet, Chen noted, adding that
although the regime has been declaring an intention to develop
democratic politics in China, in fact it has been acting to reduce
the political rights of the people.</P>
      <P>In the field of judicature, Academia Sinica Assistant Researcher
Liao Fu-te said China performed badly in work to safeguard freedom
and human dignity, establish a fair judicial system and properly
enforce the law. Citing Amnesty International statistics, he said
that in 2005 a total of 2,148 people were sentenced to death around
the world, with 1,770 of them in China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EPA DEMANDS SUNKEN INDONESIAN FREIGHTER BE REMOVED BY NEXT APRIL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) gave an ultimatum to the owner of an Indonesian freighter
Tuesday to remove a sunken ship off Taipei County in northern
Taiwan by the end of next April.</P>
      <P>Hsu Jen-tseh, a section chief of the EPA's Department of Water
Quality Protection, was referring to "Dewi Bunyu" of Indonesia, which
overturned off Taipei Harbor July 15. </P>
      <P>The sunken ship, carrying 1,000 tons of highly volatile chemical
ethyl acetate, or commonly known as "Banana Oil," and 33 tons of
petroleum products, has triggered worries that it could explode.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the latest inspection report showed that only 87 tons
of ethyl acetate and four tons of fuel oil were left on the
Indonesian vessel, now lying 50 meters under the sea and two nautical
miles off Linshanpi.</P>
      <P>"The vessel will no longer threaten the ecology and environment
of surrounding water areas," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>He said that the chemical is soluble in water and easily
breaks down, adding that the chemical originally stored in 10
tanks has almost dissolved in the water. Investigation has shown
that the ecology and fisheries in the surrounding areas have not
suffered losses.</P>
      <P>But to ensure navigational safety, Hsu said that the EPA has
asked the owner to remove the vessel and residual oil.</P>
      <P>The EPA also demanded that the owner pay for the mishap,
including more than NT$3 million (US$92,000) incurred in
administrative fees and NT$300,000 in pollution fines, by the end of
this month before he is allowed to leave the country.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the issue of a South Korean freighter, San-Ho Brother,
is more thorny. </P>
      <P>The freighter was carrying more than 3,100 tons of highly
toxic benzene when it overturned off Hsinchu.</P>
      <P>The air force mobilized F-16 fighters and the Army also
used combat helicopters to attack the ship so as to trigger an
explosion. </P>
      <P>Hsu noted that as the owner of the ship has yet to offer any 
feasible plan to remove the benzene, the EPA has since Nov. 4 served
tickets and the fines have so far accumulated to NT$58.5 million.</P>
      <P>The South Korean owner will start exploration under the sea to
prepare for the final removal work, according to Hsu.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou hosted a ceremony
Tuesday in renaming a briefing room, a meeting room and the lobby of
the Taipei City Hall building after influential figures in Taiwan's
history.</P>
      <P>Ma said he expected the new names will breathe historic and

      <P>At the ceremony, the briefing room on the 12th floor was re-named
as "Liu Ming-chuan Hall, " the meeting room on the 11th floor was
named "Wu San-lien Hall" and the lobby "Shen Pau-chen Hall."</P>
      <P>Ma described Liu Ming-chuan (1836-1896) as the father of Taiwan's
modernization, saying Liu was the person who defeated French military
troops in northern Taiwan, stopping the invasion of foreign forces.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, Liu was also the first Taiwan governor during
the Ching Dynasty, who constructed the island's first railway using
the building-operation-transfer model, called BOT.</P>
      <P>Wu San-lien (1899-1988) was appointed by the Republic of China
government to serve as Taipei mayor in 1949. One year later, he won

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHIEF DEMANDS DPP APOLOGY OVER VOTE-BUYING CHARGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 12 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou demanded a public apology Tuesday from the ruling party
over vote-buying allegations and said he strongly suspects the
allegations were part of a scheme against the KMT hopeful prior to
the Dec. 9 Kaohsiung municipal elections.</P>
      <P>Ma made the comments while answering questions from reporters on
the issue after the KMT ran an advertisement in local newspapers
accusing the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) of indulging in foul
play to win the elections.</P>
      <P>The DPP must make a public apology for the allegations it made
against Huang Chun-ying, the KMT Kaohsiung mayoral candidate, because
fairness and abiding by the law are key elements of a democratic
society, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma also blasted President Chen Shui-bian for airing unconfirmed
vote-buying accusations to attack Huang early on polling day, which
came after a questionable videotape made public on the election eve
by Chen Chu, the DPP candidate in the race, showing one of Huang's
campaign workers allegedly bribing voters aboard a bus.</P>
      <P>Such attempts to abort rival election bids, Ma said, are not only
just unlawful but also extremely immoral.</P>
      <P>Huang lost the Kaohsiung mayoral election to Chen Chu by a slim
margin of 0.14 percent, or 1,114 votes, in sharp contrast to the
results of most pre-election public opinion surveys that showed Huang
enjoyed a lead over Chen Chu, in particular in the initial stages of
the campaign.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the DPP's vote-buying charges against Huang are
far from the truth because Huang's camp would not have tried to buy
votes in a bus that it did not lease. In addition, he pointed out,
the street intersection where the bus was parked at the time was not
a district where the KMT enjoys widespread support.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Secretary-General Chan Chun-po said that he will
take full responsibility for the KMT's loss in the Kaohsiung mayoral
election and added that he has offered Ma his resignation.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the advertisement that the KMT ran in local
newspapers questioning the DPP's win in the Kaohsiung mayoral race,
KMT spokesman Huang Yu-chen said that his party hopes to bring the
truth to light and leave the issue to be judged by the public.</P>
      <P>The KMT is by no means a bad loser, but the Kaohsiung people must
realize that no one can be allowed to win an election by nefarious
means, he said.</P>

but PFP lawmakers urged him to take over the helm in the absence of
Soong, who announced his decision Dec. 9 to bow out of politics
following a humiliating defeat in the Taipei mayoral election.</P>
      <P>Chang told the PFP legislators that he would stay in office
temporarily only if the PFP lawmakers agree to support the Cabinet
and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's version of proposed
legislation requiring political parties, especially the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT), to return ill-gotten party assets to the
national coffers.</P>
      <P>The quid pro quo drew mixed reactions from the 22 PFP
legislators, half of whom accepted his offer, while the other half
were opposed to it.</P>
      <P>While acknowledging that the PFP caucus needs to form a consensus
on the issue, Legislator Cheng Chin-ling, convener of the PFP
legislative caucus, said she believes the rift between the DPP and
its "pan-blue alliance" partner, the KMT, is unlikely to deepen,
because the proposed legislation in question would uphold social
justice.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Hung-chun, spokesman for the PFP, said the tough
condition shows that Chang is really not very interested in remaining
in his post.</P>
      <P>He added that the PFP caucus does not have an answer to the
question now because it needs time to consider such a vital issue.</P>
      <P>In reaction, the KMT legislative caucus deplored Chang's quid pro
quo, claiming that the Cabinet and DPP's version of the draft
legislation on ill-gotten party assets is "unfair and unjustified"
because it is targeted specifically at the KMT.</P>
      <P>The KMT has made clear previously that it will propose its own
version of a political party law to deal with the party asset issue.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsai Chin-lung, a whip of the KMT legislative caucus,
expressed confidence that most PFP legislators will not work with the
DPP against the KMT.</P>
      <P>He added that KMT legislators expect continued close cooperation
with their PFP counterparts in the legislature.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KAOHSIUNG MAYOR-ELECT DENIES CHARGES OF FABRICATING EVIDENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,   Dec.  13  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vote-buying allegations made by
Kaohsiung mayor-elect Chen Chu against his opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) rival were not fabricated by the Chen camp and the KMT should
immediately stop smearing Chen by making such claims, a spokesman for
Chen's election campaign said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to Hsiao Yu-cheng, Chen Chu's campaign workers filmed
what they claimed was vote-buying by campaign workers for Huang
Chun-ying, the KMT's candidate in the Dec. 9 Kaohsiung mayoral race,
aboard a bus Dec. 8 after receiving a tipoff the previous day.</P>
      <P>The Chen Chu camp released the videotape on the eve of the
election and President Chen Shui-bian made vote-buying allegations
against Huang early on polling day -- developments that the KMT
claimed led to his defeat.</P>
      <P>In response to the KMT's charges that the videotape was a plot
orchestrated by the Chen Chu camp to ruin Huang's election bid, Hsiao
called it KMT mud-slinging and argued that it is aimed at blurring
the focus of the matter.</P>
      <P>Hsiao expressed his belief that the matter will soon be clarified
as relevant evidence has been referred to prosecutors. Secret
witnesses and several people filmed on the bus have also displayed
willingness to testify before prosecutors, he added.</P>
      <P>He urged the KMT not to comment further on the incident, as the
prosecution is investigating the matter.</P>
      <P>Huang, who lost the Kaohsiung mayoral election to Chen Chu by a
slender margin of 0.14 percent, has filed a lawsuit against her to
clear his name and has demanded a recount of the votes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER URGES EARLY ADJUSTMENT TO FACE MAJOR ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Tuesday that the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) should adjust and
improve for the legislative elections of late 2007 and the
presidential election of early 2008.</P>
      <P>Wang also said that "the important thing is to think about
winning the 2008 presidential election" and that "all other things
are insignificant."</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks amid reports that Lien Chan, honorary
chairman of the KMT, urged KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou at a meeting
that day to cooperate with Wang. Lien wants Ma to invite Wang -- a
seasoned and savvy politician from Kaohsiung, a stronghold of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party -- to serve as his first deputy
chairman.</P>
      <P>Asked about reports of teaming up with Ma for the 2008
presidential election, Wang declined to comment.</P>
      <P>Reports also said that some "native" legislators have strongly
urged a party conference to discuss the party's "native" direction,
which is considered to be the party's Achilles heel and one of the
main reasons it lost the Kaohsiung mayoral election by a razor-thin
margin. The DPP, although it lost in the Taipei mayoral election,
garnered more votes than in the previous election. </P>
      <P>With the DPP pulling free of the quagmire it was in for months in
the wake of a spate of alleged corruption scandals implicating the
family members of President Chen Shui-bian and his senior aides and
registering a better-than-expected performance, Wang said a party
review should not target only Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Wang said that all 23 cities and counties in the country,
including seven cities and counties now served by DPP heads, are
important and that the KMT "should think seriously about how to win
back the trust of the people."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP VOWS TO CONTINUE OPPOSING ARMS PROCUREMENT BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  12 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP)
vowed Tuesday that it will continue to oppose any plans by the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government to buy arms from the
United States at what the party described as "exotic prices."</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Hung-chun, spokesman for the PFP, reiterated his
party's determination after PFP legislators and their allies in the
main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) joined forces at a meeting of the
legislature's Procedure Committee to block a bill requesting a NT$6.3
billion supplementary budget for a submarine feasibility assessment,
P-3C anti-submarine aircraft in the first year, and the upgrading of
Patriot II missiles.</P>
      <P>The KMT again collaborated with the PFP against the arms
procurement legislation despite its previous assurance that the
supplementary budget would be included in the legislative agenda of
the current legislative session.</P>
      <P>It was the 66th time in five years that the arms procurement
budget legislation submitted by the DPP government had been blocked
in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that Randy Schriver, former U.S. deputy assistant
secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, had said that
the PFP's dwindling influence after the Dec. 9 mayoral and city
council elections in Taipei and Kaohsiung would allow its ally, the
KMT, to have a free hand in supporting the arms procurement plans.</P>
      <P>"The PFP's position on arms procurement is not something that Mr.
Schriver or the United States can manipulate," he said, vowing that
the PFP will continue to oppose any plans to buy arms from the United
States at unreasonable prices.</P>
      <P>The DPP government has planned to purchase eight diesel-electric
submarines, a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft and six
Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries from the United States.</P>
      <P>An initial budget bill requesting NT$610.8 billion (US$16
billion) was slashed to NT$480 billion last year to placate the
opposition lawmakers. It was further reduced to NT$340 billion to
purchase only the submarines and the sub-hunting aircraft, but
opposition lawmakers have repeatedly refused to include the draft
bill on the legislative agenda.</P>
      <P>A separate bill requesting a NT$6.3 billion supplementary budget
would earmark NT$200 million for a submarine feasibility assessment,
NT$1.7 billion for the P-3Cs in the first year, NT$3.7 billion for he
upgrading of the Patriot II missiles, and NT$700 million for building
an airstrip on Taiping Island in the Spratly archipelago located in
the southern part of South China Sea.</P>

      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed an amendment to
the Education Basic Law Tuesday, banning any form of corporal
punishment in schools and making Taiwan the 109th country in the
world to protect students with formal legislation.</P>
      <P>The Humanistic Education Foundation -- the prime mover behind the

passed the amendment following a third reading.</P>
      <P>According to a spokesman for the foundation, the amended law will
benefit 5.3 million students in different levels of schools
throughout Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that all students are entitled to the right not to be
subjected to physical punishment, be they in public or private
kindergartens, elementary schools, high schools, colleges or any
other educational institutions.</P>
      <P>The spokesman pointed out that the U.N. Secretary-General's Study

Committee of the General Assembly by independent expert Paulo Sergio
Pinheiro, urges more than 130 countries that have signed the U.N.
Convention on the Rights of the Child to pass legislation on zero

percent.</P>
      <P>According to a consensus reached among the lawmakers, the maximum

as suggested by the government. Previously, there had been no such
limit imposed.</P>
      <P>The consensus will be enacted Dec. 15 and put into practice Feb.
16 next year.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu of the opposition Kuomintang, which had
resisted cutting this privilege for retired government employees,
said afterward that her party agreed to the deal "reluctantly".</P>
      <P>Under this consensus, a Feb. 26 decree issued by the Ministry of

Confucius' lesson of the day: "If in governing you depend upon
laws and maintain order by enforcing those laws by punishments, you
can also make the people keep away from wrongdoing, but they will
lose the sense of shame for wrongdoing. If, on the other hand, in
government you depend upon moral sentiment and maintain order by
encouraging education and good manners, the people will have a sense
of shame for wrongdoing and, moreover, will emulate what is good."</TEXT>

(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed an amendment to
the Education Basic Law Tuesday, banning any form of corporal
punishment in schools and making Taiwan the 109th country in the
world to protect students with formal legislation.</P>
      <P>The Humanistic Education Foundation -- the prime mover behind the
legislation -- welcomed the good news for students after lawmakers
passed the amendment following a third reading.</P>
      <P>According to a spokesman for the foundation, the amended law will
benefit 5.3 million students in different levels of schools
throughout Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that all students are entitled to the right not to be
subjected to physical punishment, be they in public or private
kindergartens, elementary schools, high schools, colleges or any
other educational institutions.</P>
      <P>The spokesman pointed out that the U.N. Secretary-General's Study
on Violence Against Children, presented Oct. 11 to the third
Committee of the General Assembly by independent expert Paulo Sergio
Pinheiro, urges more than 130 countries that have signed the U.N.
Convention on the Rights of the Child to pass legislation on zero
physical punishment of children by 2009.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan became the 109th country in the world to
adopt such a law after Mongolia passed similar legislation Dec. 8.</P>

      <P>Lawmakers of different political parties
agreed Tuesday to limit the amount of pensions retired government
employees can deposit in banks at a preferential interest rate of 18
percent.</P>
      <P>According to a consensus reached among the lawmakers, the maximum

by the number of years of government service, rather than 1.2 times
as suggested by the government. Previously, there had been no such
limit imposed.</P>
      <P>The consensus will be enacted Dec. 15 and put into practice Feb.
16 next year.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu of the opposition Kuomintang, which had
resisted cutting this privilege for retired government employees,
said afterward that her party agreed to the deal "reluctantly".</P>
      <P>Under this consensus, a Feb. 26 decree issued by the Ministry of

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan employers remain cautious in their
hiring intentions for the first quarter of 2007, with the country
reporting the worse employment outlook for the second consecutive
quarter among major economies in the Asia-Pacific region, according
to the results of a survey released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by Manpower Inc., a leading
international employment service provider, on more than 49,000 human
resources directors and senior hiring managers from 27 countries and
territories worldwide, 1,372 of whom are from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition to Taiwan, the seven other Asia-Pacific economies
surveyed were Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, New Zealand
and Singapore.</P>
      <P>The survey shows that Taiwan's net employment outlook for the
first quarter of 2007 stands at 15 percent, up 1 percentage point
from the current quarter but down 7 percentage points over the same
period in 2006.</P>
      <P>While 24 percent of the Taiwan respondents said they plan to
increase their staff numbers in the next quarter, 9 percent expect to
cut staff and 55 percent said they have no plans to hire new workers.</P>
      <P>Owing to the reviving housing market and the government's efforts
to expand public development projects, respondents from the
construction and mining industry demonstrated the strongest intention
to hire new workers, with the sector's net employment outlook soaring
18 percentage points from the current quarter to 23 percent for the
next quarter.</P>
      <P>The net employment outlook for the financial, insurance and real

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>One person was diagnosed with cancer every
8.4 minutes on average in Taiwan in 2003, compared with 8.5 minutes
in 2001 and 9 minutes in 2000, according to a report released
Wednesday by the Department of Health (DOH).</P>
      <P>The figures were calculated based on the number of cancer cases
at 212 hospitals around the island with at least 50 beds in 2003.</P>
      <P>There were 250.77 cancer patients out of every 100,000 people in
Taiwan in 2003, with liver cancer and breast cancer being the most
common types of cancer among men and women, respectively, the report
showed.</P>
      <P>It was found that the 10 most common types of cancer among men
were liver cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, oral cancer, stomach
cancer, prostate cancer, bladder cancer, esophagus cancer, pharyngeal
cancer and skin cancer, in that order.</P>
      <P>Among women, the 10 most common kinds of cancer were breast
cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, cervical cancer,
stomach cancer, thyroid cancer, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, and
skin cancer, in that order.</P>
      <P>Chao Kun-yu, deputy director-general of the DOH's Bureau of
Health Promotion, said a total of 62,542 new cancer cases were
reported in 2003, up 3,543 cases compared with 2002.</P>
      <P>While there were 288.98 male cancer patients out of every 100,000
men, there were 212.02 female cancer patients for every 100,000
women, Chao said.</P>
      <P>With the promotion of smear tests by public health offices around
the country, the occurrence rate of cervical cancer in women has
dropped by roughly 37 percent over the past five years, Chao said.</P>
      <P>However, the occurrence rates of oral cancer and esophagus cancer
in men have increased by 20 percent, mainly as a result of smoking,
alcohol consumption and betel nut chewing, Chao added.</P>
      <P>Since cancer tops Taiwan's list of 10 major causes of death, Chao
called for the public to form the habit of undergoing regular cancer
screening tests, pointing out that "an ounce of prevention is better
than a pound of treatment."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Approximately 40 percent of office workers
in Taiwan are so-called "credit card slaves, " with each of these
workers shouldering an average of NT$462,000 (US$14,237) in credit
card debt, according to the results of a survey released Wednesday by
an online employment service provider.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 57.31 percent of the respondents mostly
make purchases with cash, 28.06 percent with both cash and credit
cards, and 14.33 percent mostly with credit cards.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, the period of time needed for an
indebted worker to pay off their credit card debt is 36 months on
average.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by 1111 Job Bank on 1,340 office workers
via online questionnaires between Nov. 27 and Dec. 11. It has a
margin of error of plus or minus 2.7 percentage points.</P>

      <P>By gender, 63.33 percent of women and 47.1 percent of men have

impulse purchases were to reward themselves while in a good mood,
getting discounted prices during department store sales, and making

Council of Grand Justices Thursday for an interpretation on Article
52 of the Constitution regarding the president's immunity from
prosecution, a caucus leader said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The caucus will also request that the trial on the alleged misuse
of the president's "state affairs fund" be suspended until the
constitutional dispute is clarified, according to Ker Chien-ming,
convener of the DPP caucus.</P>
      <P>Claiming that it is in violation of the president's immunity for

protecting the constitutional system and ensuring the normal

    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Taipei University of
Technology (NTUT) presented around 30 cartons of books and five
computers to the Gambia Wednesday to be distributed to children
there.</P>
      <P>Mawdo C. Juwara, Gambian ambassador to the Republic of China,
received the donations presented by NTUT President Lee Tsu-tian.</P>
      <P>The donation coincided with an official visit to Gambia by
Premier Su Tseng-chang, who was scheduled to leave for the West
African country later that day to attend the inauguration of
re-elected President Yahya Jammeh slated for Dec. 15.</P>
      <P>The idea for the donation came up this summer when Lee led a
29-member NTUT delegation comprised of faculty and students to Gambia
for a three-week cultural exchange visit.</P>
      <P>Lee said during that visit that he saw poverty has resulted in
denial of access to cultural assets in most African countries,
including Gambia, prompting him to launch a book and computer-raising
drive when he returned to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that "knowledge is power, " Lee said the poor will become
rich through books while the rich will become wiser through reading.</P>
      <P>NTUT and Gambia maintain an academic cooperation program that
includes classes offered by NTUT to Gambian students and government
officials in the fields of oil exploration and information
technology.</P>
      <P>With financial support from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) , NTUT will be sponsoring the program starting next August,
offering four-year university education scholarships to 25 Gambian
citizens.</P>
      <P>Lee said during his visit in Gambia that he met with Jammeh, who
had told him that he hopes the Gambian people can establish a
"Silicon Valley" by 2020, a goal that makes the nurturing of
high-tech talent imperative.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, Jammeh said he is grateful that the MOFA and
NTUT are sponsoring information technology classes for Gambian
students to help Gambia realize its dream.</P>
      <P>In addition to attending the English IT class, the students will
also be able to take other NTUT classes such as electronic
engineering, electrical engineering and optoelectronics, as elective
courses, Lee said.</P>
      <P>NTUT has since 2004 helped Gambia nurture specialists in oil
exploration and other areas of the petroleum industry by offering
four-year university courses to 25 Gambian citizens, also under the

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang urged all political
figures and parties Wednesday to reflect upon themselves and move
toward democratic maturity.</P>
      <P>Su said that if political figures and parties become arrogant
after winning elections and create disturbances when losing them,
then they will "not live up to the expectations of the voters."</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks at a Cabinet meeting in which he
said that the smooth conclusion of the mayoral and city
councilor elections in Taipei and Kaohsiung has underscored the
maturity of Taiwan's democracy.</P>
      <P>"There will be winners and losers in every election," the premier
said, and all should accept the election outcome.</P>
      <P>He noted that there will be bitter rivalry during each election
campaign, which he termed a norm of democratic politics and also a
chance for political parties to reflect upon themselves and to make
headway.</P>
      <P>Now that elections are over, he expressed the hope that all will
put aside their rivalries and return to the urgent tasks of improving
the nation's economy and law and order, as well as social justice.</P>
      <P>He said that vote-rigging was rampant in Taiwan's elections "in
early years," but added that nowadays, from presidential elections
down to borough chief elections, they are held in a transparent way.</P>
      <P>The premier's words came as Huang Chun-ying, the candidate of the
main opposition Kuomintang in the Kaohsiung mayoral election who lost
by a razor-thin margin of 1,114 votes to his rival Chen Chu of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party, filed a lawsuit demanding that
the result be invalidated on the basis that legal infractions
occurred, including irregularities by election staff.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung District Court has impounded all the ballot boxes
pending a possible vote recount.</P>
      <P>Huang also protested vehemently a DPP accusation that Huang's
campaign workers paid participants for showing up at his final
campaign rally on the eve of Saturday's election.</P>
      <P>Huang and KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou claimed that the accusation
was a scheme orchestrated by the DPP to smear Huang in the last
stretch of the campaign.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged the prosecution authorities on
polling day to investigate Huang's alleged vote-buying, triggering
further accusations by the KMT that this was aimed at swaying the
voters.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung Prosecutor's Office has already begun
investigations and a man who admitted paying NT$500 each to a
coach-load of participants at a Huang rally has been taken into
custody.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIDS SPREADING AMONG TAIWAN FEMALE DRUG ADDICTS: HOSPITAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 13 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While the number of female AIDS patients is
rapidly growing around the world, the number in Taiwan has also been
rising, in particular among female drug abusers, an official at
National Cheng Kung University Hospital (NCKUH) in southern Tainan
City said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Shing-chun, an NCKUH doctor, ascribed the spread of AIDS
among local female drug addicts to rampant needle-sharing, adding
that the practice has since 2005 outpaced sexual activity as the No.
1 cause of infection.</P>
      <P>Some 20 years ago, there was one woman in every 10 AIDS patients
in Taiwan, with the ratio increasing to one in eight today, Lin
reported, expressing concern that the actual number might be triple
that reported to the official authorities.</P>
      <P>As most Taiwan women infected with AIDS are usually diagnosed
through pre-natal examinations at hospitals or clinics, it is very
hard to trace the disease among those who have had abortions or who
don't plan to give birth, she said.</P>
      <P>Most of Taiwan's female AIDS patients are aged between 16 and 45,
with half of them married housewives. Only a small number of them are
sex workers, relavent statistic showed.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong might change his mind and not retire from
politics until 2008, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, Soong voiced willingness during a meeting they
had Tuesday to "rethink" his decision to retire from politics.</P>
      <P>If Soong really changes his mind, he will stay on at least until
after the 2008 presidential election, Wang pointed out, adding that
Soong is a seasoned and capable political figure and that he tried to
persuade Soong to continue contributing to the country, as ongoing
political development is critical to Taiwan's future.</P>
      <P>Wang said that he also urged Soong to stay on as head of the PFP
and to push for its consolidation with the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) . However, he added that it remains unclear whether Soong will
remain in that position.</P>
      <P>Soong announced his retirement from politics last Saturday
evening after conceding defeat in the Taipei mayoral election. He
garnered only 53,000 votes, or 4.1 percent of the total, ranking a
distant third among the six candidates.</P>
      <P>PFP spokesman Lee Hung-chun said later Wednesday that the PFP has
not any set position about establishing a formal alliance with the
KMT -- consensus on which was reached between Soong and KMT Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou prior to the Dec. 9 Taipei and Kaohsiung municipal
elections.</P>
      <P>The PFP has neither worked out any specific model nor has it
drafted any plan aimed at consolidating with the KMT, Lee said.</P>
      <P>He also denied a local newspaper report that the PFP has agreed
in principle to merge with the KMT based on the New Party model --
meaning that the two parties would first engage in talent exchanges
and establish a cooperation platform before moving toward an eventual
consolidation, probably by the end of next year after the legislative
elections.</P>
      <P>The KMT, the PFP and the New Party already comprise a loose
"pan-blue alliance."</P>

      <P>The first of the tests is scheduled to be held in March 2007 and
applications to take the test can be made this month until Dec. 29,
said Walis Pelin. The examinees will sit two examinations -- one on

      <P>Those who pass the test will be entitled to extra points for
their entrance examinations to high schools and colleges, he said.</P>

      <P>Touting the tests at the Legislative Yuan, Walis Pelin said
potential indigenous examinees can familiarize themselves with the
languages -- including 12 languages from 12 indigenous tribes and 43
sub-dialects -- by studying textbooks published by the Ministry of

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  13 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Rotavirus infection is the most common
cause of acute gastroenteritis among children in Taiwan, with up to
10,000 children hospitalized every year as a result of the infection,
according to a report released Wednesday by National Taiwan
University Hospital.</P>
      <P>The report said that 160,000 to 540,000 people seek medical
treatment for rotavirus infection every year in Taiwan, 3,000 to
10,000 of whom require hospitalization because of gastroenteritis
triggered by the virus.</P>
      <P>The medical costs resulting from rotavirus-related
hospitalization amount to NT$300 million to NT$1 billion per year,
the report said.</P>
      <P>Huang Li-min, a pediatrician at the hospital, pointed out that
most children will be infected with rotavirus at least once before
they reach five years old, with 20 percent displaying severe
symptoms.</P>
      <P>Huang said rotavirus is the most prevalent between November and
March each year and that common symptoms of the infection include
diarrhea, vomiting, fever and abdominal pain.</P>
      <P>In some cases, the infection can lead to severe complications
such as dehydration, shock and even death, he said.</P>
      <P>He suggested that parents should have their children vaccinated
against rotavirus to prevent infection.</P>
      <P>Also Wednesday, GlaxoSmithKline Inc., a leading pharmaceutical
company, announced that it will donate oral rotavirus vaccine to the
city and county of Taipei for vaccination of infants up to six months
from low-income families.</P>
      <P>The vaccines will be provided free of charge to the targeted
children starting Dec. 18 at the Jenai, Chunghsing, Yangming,

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian expressed hope
Wednesday that France will support Taiwan's bid to join the World
Health Organization (WHO) as an observer, saying that Taiwan has
worked toward the WHO goal for 10 years.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks at the Presidential Office when he
received Christian Bataille, chairman of a pro-Taiwan group in
France's National Assembly, who is heading a visiting delegation of
French lawmakers.</P>
      <P>The president said Taiwan hopes to play an active role in
international organizations, especially as medical care should be
without borders and the voice of the 23 million people of Taiwan
should be heard.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has worked toward joining the WHO as an observer for the
past decade," Chen said, expressing the hope that Taiwan's cause will
get support from the French government and National Assembly.</P>
      <P>The president likened the friendship between Taiwan and France as
"red wine that will get even more aromatic as time goes by."</P>
      <P>He also noted that bilateral trade between the two countries
totaled US$4 billion last year, with France enjoying a trade surplus
of US$1.06 billion. Taiwan is France's sixth-largest importer in Asia
and its fifth-largest export destination.</P>
      <P>"There is still ample room for the development of bilateral
relations," he added.</P>
      <P>He also said that Lafayette frigates and Mirage-2000 fighters
purchased from France now form the backbone of Taiwan's naval and air
forces.</P>
      <P>On the European Union's intention to lift an arms embargo on
China in place since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, Chen also
expressed concern.</P>
      <P>He said that since the massacre, China's human rights record has
yet to improve, with many dissidents, religious figures and
journalists still persecuted.</P>
      <P>China is notorious for its lack of respect for freedom of speech,
the press and religion, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said the lifting of the arms embargo would be tantamount to
letting a unfree and undemocratic China deal with a free and
democratic Taiwan, which would also endanger the peace and stability
of the Asia and Pacific region.</P>
      <P>He said China's defense budget has been increasing in double
digits over the past 17 years, while it also passed its
Anti-Secession Law in March 2005 giving itself the "legal basis" to
launch a military attack against Taiwan should it tilt toward
independence.</P>
      <P>China has also deployed more than 800 missiles in its coastal
areas opposite Taiwan, a number that is increasing at a speed of more
than 100 missiles per year, leaving Taiwan people under the constant
threat from the other side of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Residuals of polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs) and insecticides have been found near the estuary of the
Tamsui river, posing a possible threat to human health, officials of
National Taiwan Ocean University (NTOU) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>A research team, led by Gong Gwo-ching, a professor at NTOU's
Department of Oceanography, has surveyed coastal areas near the
Tamsui river estuary for several months and has found the levels of
environmental hormones, especially PCBs and insecticides, have been
higher than normal in the mud on the perimeters of the discharge
pipelines of the Bali sewage treatment plant.</P>
      <P>Gong suggested that although Taiwan has prohibited the use of
PCBs for years, old residuals have not decomposed and still exist in
the environment.</P>
      <P>PCB residuals travel with rain or ground water into the river and
are then deposited at the estuary and coast, Gong said, adding that
they could enter the food chain and damage human health if they are
digested by fish or shrimp.</P>
      <P>"The worry is not unfounded," he noted, "since we found disrupted
gene expressions by environmental hormones in the livers in four
species of fish, including mullet -- a common fish in local markets."</P>
      <P>He said that the levels of PCB are still far below the standard
that would pose an immediate threat to health. "However, consumers
are recommended not to eat fish skin, guts and heads," he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) heavyweights thanked voters Wednesday for their support
in the Dec. 9 municipal elections in Taipei and Kaohsiung cities.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun, Premier Su Tseng-chang, former Premier
Frank Hsieh and Kaohsiung Mayor-elect Chen Chu expressed their
appreciation for voters' backing at a news conference prior to the
weekly meeting of the DPP's Central Standing Committee -- the first
since last Saturday's elections.</P>
      <P>According to Yu, voter support for the DPP is a reflection of the
public's desire to safeguard the country and a clean government. The
DPP will take concrete action to respond to voters' high
expectations, he promised.</P>
      <P>Chen defeated his opposition Kuomintang rival Huang Chun-ying in
the close-run Kaohsiung mayoral race by a slim margin, while Hsieh,
despite his defeat, performed better than expected and gained some 41
percent of the votes in the hard-fought Taipei mayoral election.</P>
      <P>While Vice President Annette Lu was absent from the news
conference, interaction between Hsieh and Su -- the DPP's most likely
contenders at present to vie for the 2008 presidential election --
became the central focus of media.</P>
      <P>As Hsieh seemed to have markedly cemented his power base due to
his relatively good performance in the Taipei mayoral race, Su is
also a DPP figure who enjoys widespread support at a time when the
party's image has been tarnished by a series of corruption
allegations related to the first family.</P>

      <P>Ministers from 10 countries -- New Zealand, Canada, Japan, Fiji,

Austronesia is considered by experts as the most widespread language
family in the world, reaching Madagascar in the west, Easter Island
in the east, New Zealand in the south and Taiwan in the north.</P>

Austronesian language, have the same marine culture, and face the

colonization.</P>
      <P>As a result, all the Austronesian peoples can forge partnerships
to work on these issues, he said.</P>
      <P>He added that since 2002, the council has organized international

    <TEXT>New York Times:White
House to Delay Shift on Iraq Until '07

The White House said Tuesday that President
Bush would delay presenting any new strategy for
Iraq until early next year, as officials suggested
that Mr. Bush's advisers were locked in internal
debates on several fronts about how to proceed.

Wall Street Journal:How Immigration Upended
Dreams Of an Entrepreneur

Amid the debate over illegal immigration, one
of the most contentious questions is whether
unauthorized workers from Mexico and other Latin
American countries displace U.S. workers,
especially low-wage workers in agriculture,
cleaning and construction. The Hairstons' saga
shows that the issue is not just about low-paid
workers, but also entrepreneurs who set out to
make their own fortune.</TEXT>

      <P>The charter flight was the first of its kind between Kinmen and
Singapore under a cooperation agreement between TransAsia Airways and
the Kinmen county government, the officials said.</P>
      <P>It was the return flight of a TransAsia plane that carried 189

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI'S AVERAGE HOUSE PRICE 3.3 TIMES THAT OF KAOHSIUNG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 13 (CNA)
(By T.C. Jiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>This year's average housing price in the
capital city of Taipei is 3.3 times that of southern Kaohsiung city,
according to the results of a survey released by Yungching Real
Estate Group.</P>
      <P>The study also showed the price gap has continued to widen
since 2003.</P>
      <P>The group's president, Liao Ben-sheng, explained that Taipei city
offers more job opportunities, which serves as an incentive for the
working population in other parts of Taiwan to flow into the
city.</P>
      <P>As a result, although Taipei and Kaohsiung are special
municipalities under the Cabinet's direct jurisdiction, their
residents have a different willingness and purchasing power to buy a
house or an apartment, Liao said.</P>
      <P>The study indicated that after the outbreak of severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the overall housing market began
to boom, with an average housing price increase of 10 percent every
year -- while Kaohsiung saw less than 5 percent of annual increase.</P>
      <P>According to another survey the group had conducted with 104 Job
Bank, an online job site for Taiwan, 66 percent of Taipei office
workers wanted to remain in the city, compared to merely 33 percent
of Kaohsiung office workers who had the same view.</P>
      <P>Liao pointed out the increasing number of office workers will
provide a boost in the housing market.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs
(CLA) rebutted Wednesday as "unfactual and erroneous" a U.S. media
report that claimed an average 2,500 cases involving abuse of
Vietnamese laborers are reported annually in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tsai Meng-liang, a CLA section chief in charge of vocational
training affairs for migrant workers, said the CLA has cooperated
with non-governmental organizations to offer temporary shelter for
disgruntled foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>"Most of those staying at temporary shelter centers were mainly
involved in salary disputes with their employers, and only a few
cases were related to abuse or maltreatment," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, Tsai went on, the government has made many
improvements in foreign labor administration and management with a
view to better protecting their rights and interests. For instance,
since November employers have been required to report the arrival of
their foreign employees to local government authorities within three
days.</P>
      <P>Starting this year, Tsai said, local employers can no longer
arbitrarily take the initiative to have a foreign worker repatriated
before their working contract expires. In such a case, local labor
administrators must explore the foreign laborer's views before
determining whether repatriation should be carried out.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Tsai said, local employers are now required to offer
better meals and lodging conditions for their foreign employees in
addition to modernizing relevant management rules.</P>
      <P>The CLA has consistently offered subsidies for local governments
to inspect foreign laborers' living and working conditions and to
provide them with counseling services, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>According to CLA tallies, more than 336,000 foreign nationals are
now working in Taiwan legally, with Thailand and the Philippines
tying as the top source of foreign labor, followed by Vietnam,
Malaysia and Mongolia.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday
differences in political stances should not impede national
development nor blot out hard-won achievements in reform and
advancement in various aspects.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while attending an annual
award-presentation ceremony in honor of outstanding civil servants.</P>
      <P>Praising the prize winners for their dedication to public
service, Chen said they have become catalyst for changes and standard
bearer for reform and innovation. "I salute your efforts to upgrade
public service quality and operational efficiency," he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that the fruit of reform and development belongs to all
fellow citizens, Chen said partisan competition should never smudge
progress in infrastructure construction and nor should political
differences hinder sustainable economic growth.</P>
      <P>Chen said it is hoped that the opposition-controlled Legislative
Yuan can pass a number of critical bills and budget proposals to
facilitate reform and development.</P>
      <P>During his six-year presidency, Chen said he has pulled out all
the stops to complete a number of tough infrastructure construction
projects, including the Hsuehshan Tunnel -- the centerpiece of the
Peiyi Expressway that shortens the travel time from Taipei to Yilan
to just half an hour from original two hours -- and the Yuanshantzu
flood-prevention sluice along the Keelung River that has spared
residents in the greater Taipei area from flood damages during
typhoon season.</P>
      <P>Chen also took the opportunity to tout the achievements of the
Central Taiwan Science Park which he said has quickly grown into one
of the world's most promising high-tech heartland, with its 2006
turnover expected to nearly double the year-earlier level.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan has completed a
preliminary review of a proposed amendment to the Income Tax Law that
would allow taxpayers to claim a higher deduction for educational
expenses.</P>
      <P>According to the bill passed by the Finance Committee Wednesday,
taxpayers would be able to claim a deduction of up to NT$25,000
(US$769) for educational expenses for each child who is receiving
higher education, compared with up to NT$25,000 per household at
present.</P>
      <P>In addition, taxpayers would also be able to claim a deduction of
up to NT$25,000 for each child who is within three years before
entering elementary school.</P>
      <P>The amount of the allowed deduction would be adjusted accordingly
whenever there is an average hike of more than 3 percent in the
tuition fees of local colleges and universities, according to the
committee.</P>
      <P>Chang Sheng-ho, director-general of the Ministry of Finance's
Taxation Agency, estimated that approximately 2 million people will

    <HEADLINE>VOTE-BUYING SCANDAL SUSPECT ADMITS TO HANDING OUT HIS OWN MONEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung, Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A key suspect in the vote-buying scandal
surrounding last weekend's Kaohsiung municipal elections said
Thursday that he did give money to participants in opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) candidate Huang Chun-ying's campaign rally but was
not told by any one to do so.</P>
      <P>Ku Hsin-ming, who surrendered to prosecution investigators
accompanied by his lawyer, told the media that although he handed out
money to passengers on a bus, he is innocent because he was not doing
it for anyone and because the money was his own.</P>
      <P>He explained that he gave passengers NT$500 each "just to call on
more people to attend the campaign rally of a certain candidate."</P>
      <P>Police earlier detained Tsai Neng-hsiang, nicknamed "Hei Sung, "
or "Black Pine, " after viewing videotape of him handing out NT$500
to passengers on a bus last Friday.</P>
      <P>Investigators have since interviewed 22 of the people who were
aboard the buses on which the alleged vote-buying occurred. All of
them told the investigators that they had received NT$500 as they
were urged to "vote for a certain mayoral candidate and a certain
city council candidate."</P>
      <P>The investigators have found that both Ku and Tsai had been
passing out money to passengers on board two buses, which were rented
by Ku.</P>
      <P>Tsai received tens of thousands of NT dollars from Ku, and they
talked to each other by cell phone immediately before they began to
distribute the money, according to the initial results of the
investigation.</P>
      <P>Ku disappeared for several days after the incident became a major
news story as Huang, who lost the election by a razor-thin margin,
blamed his defeat in part on the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP's) underhanded tactic of accusing the KMT of vote-buying
on the eve of the election.</P>
      <P>As the prosecution continued its probe into the matter, Huang
called on the investigators to subject all those involved to a
polygraph, or lie-detector test, in order to uncover the facts as
quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Huang noted the license plate numbers of the suspected buses did
not match with any of those rented to carry people to his campaign
rally, which he said proves that his campaign had nothing to do with
the alleged vote-buying.</P>
      <P>He has filed a lawsuit with the court to declare his DPP rival's
election victory invalid and to request a vote recount.</P>

    <HEADLINE>65% DISAPPOINTED WITH GOVERNMENT'S ANIT-VOTE-BUYING CAMPAIGN: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A majority of respondents to a recent
opinion poll expressed disappointment with the government-led
campaign against election bribery, pollsters said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 1,604 randomly chosen adult residents,
conducted by the Taiwan chapter of Transparency International (TI) in
July, found that 65 percent of those interviewed felt the
government's anti-vote buying campaign was insufficiently effective.</P>
      <P>Comparing the results with similar surveys conducted in the
previous two years, Chen Chun-ming, a TI Taiwan researcher in charge
of the survey, said the latest poll shows that more people have
become disillusioned with the government's anti-vote-buying campaign.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, Chen said, the respondents were positive
about the government's efforts to promote political integrity and
accountability but were dissatisfied with the results of the efforts,
including efforts to eliminate shady links between politics and
organized crime and crack down on official corruption and election
bribery.</P>
      <P>More than 70 percent of the respondents expressed disappointment
with the campaign against official corruption and involvement of
criminal rings in politics, Chen said, adding that the figure is
higher than those recorded in the previous polls.</P>
      <P>Although the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) has adopted many new
measures in investigating suspected vote-buying cases, Chen said the
poll results show that those efforts have so far failed to boost
local people's confidence in the campaign's effectiveness. "This is a
phenomenon worthy of our attention," he stressed.</P>
      <P>The latest poll also shows that over 60 percent are unsatisfied
with the government's recent efforts to revamp unused public
facilities.</P>
      <P>Asked about their level of confidence in the process of improving
the government's integrity, 39 percent expressed optimism regarding
the issue, while 47 percent said they are pessimistic.</P>
      <P>As to what constitutes the most serious violation of political
integrity or ethics, election bribery was mentioned most often by the
respondents, followed by lobbying public officials for illicit favors
or personal gain.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 60 percent of those polled said they think the
requirement for public office holders to declare their family assets
can be effective in promoting clean politics; more than 60 percent
said they believe that demanding political appointees to place their
assets into trust will contribute to political integrity; and 80
percent expressed support for the proposal to make it a crime for
senior officials not to clearly account for significant increases in
personal assets.</P>
      <P>While 65 percent said they believe that the establishment of an
independent anti-corruption agency will contribute to political
integrity and clean politics, the percentage of those who think
otherwise has risen steadily in the past three years, Chen said,
adding this phenomenon deserves further study in order to figure out
the root cause.</P>
      <P>The Berlin-based organization Transparency International is
dedicated to wiping out government corruption and enhancing political
accountability. It has branches in more than 90 countries. The
organization's Taiwan chapter has been commissioned by the Ministry
of Justice to conduct an annual political integrity index survey over
the past few years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOST BELIEVE CHINA'S ENGAGEMENTS WITH TAIWAN ILL-MOTIVATED: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A majority of the Taiwan people are
suspicious of China's intentions regarding conducting exchanges
across the Taiwan Strait, with more than 60 percent of respondents to
a recent opinion poll believing that China's engagements with Taiwan
are mostly ill-motivated, pollsters said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The poll conducted by the quasi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) also found that the number of Taiwan people inclined
to support the pursuit of Taiwan independence is higher than the
number of Taiwan people who want to maintain the present status quo.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,073 valid samples were collected in the telephone
survey conducted Nov. 26-27 on adults randomly chosen from around the
country. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.99
percentage points.</P>
      <P>In the poll, 60.1 percent of the respondents said they believe
that China's military, diplomatic, economic, social and cultural
actions toward Taiwan are mostly ill-motivated rather than based on
good will.</P>
      <P>Nearly 55 percent of those polled said they are worried about the
overconcentration of Taiwan's outbound investments in China, compared
to 29.6 percent who said they are not concerned about the matter.</P>
      <P>While 21.7 percent said they are satisfied with the fact that
annual two-way trade across the Taiwan Strait will soon surpass the
US$80 billion mark, 30.6 percent said they are unhappy with this
development.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 68.9 percent said they support the government's policy
of opening Taiwan's doors to Chinese tourists, but the respondents
were divided over the government's current regulations governing
Chinese people's visit to Taiwan. While 30.8 percent said the current
rules are too strict, 30 percent said the restrictions are too loose,
and 14 percent said the existing control measures are "just right."</P>
      <P>Nearly 60 percent gave the thumbs-down to China's insistence on
engaging only with Taiwan's opposition "pan-blue alliance" parties --
the Kuomintang, the People First Party and the New Party -- and
refusing to have any dialogue with Taiwan's democratically-elected
leaders and government.</P>
      <P>On the sensitive issue regarding Taiwan's future, 33.5 percent
said they look forward to seeing formal Taiwan independence; 22.7
percent said they want to see cross-strait unification; and 23.8
percent said maintaining the status quo is the best option for
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If the present status quo couldn't be maintained, 41.9 percent
said they would opt for independence, compared to 31.4 percent who
said they would choose unification with China.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the poll results, professor Chen Ming-tong of National
Taiwan University said that young people in Taiwan have become
increasingly hostile toward China and that they are becoming more
vocal in expressing their views on Taiwan's future regarding the
issue of independence versus unification.</P>
      <P>"The poll results attest to Beijing's intensified campaign to woo
Taiwan's youth. I'm convinced that Beijing authorities would be
interested in the findings of this survey," he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) assured
the public Thursday of the safety of locally produced Agaricus blazei
Murill mushrooms, after some products sold on the Taiwan market were
discovered to contain a toxic chemical.</P>
      <P>Addressing the issue during a committee meeting in the
Legislative Yuan, COA Vice Chairman Lin Kuo-hua claimed that the
products discovered to contain a toxic chemical were imported and
that there is no such problem with locally produced Agaricus blazei
Murill mushrooms.</P>
      <P>Lin was responding to the results of tests on 35 mushroom
products released Wednesday by the Consumers' Foundation, which
indicated cadmium content in all eight Agaricus blazei Murill
products sampled by the foundation.</P>
      <P>With the exception of one in which the cadmium content was within
the maximum acceptable level of 2 ppm, all the other seven Agaricus
blazei Murill products contained an excessive amount of cadmium,
according to the test results.</P>
      <P>In one of these products, the cadmium content was found to be
more than eight times the maximum acceptable level.</P>
      <P>However, contrary to what the COA claims, data from the
foundation shows that one of the sampled products was produced by an
organic farm located near Sun Moon Lake in Nantou County.</P>

    <HEADLINE>1ST HALF OF 2007 OPPORTUNE TIME FOR CROSS-STRAIT TALKS: MAC HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The first half of 2007 may be an opportune
time to restart cross-strait talks on issues that are important to
the interests of people in both Taiwan and China, Taiwan's top
official in charge of China policy planning said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Since cross-strait negotiation has been an issue that has often
been manipulated by candidates during elections, the first half of
next year, during which there will not be any elections, seems to be
an ideal period for cross-strait talks, said Joseph Wu, chairman of
the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that the two sides can restart negotiations in the
following months on issues including the opening of Taiwan to Chinese
tourists, the expansion of cross-strait charter flight services, the
building of monetary supervisory systems across the strait, and joint
efforts in crime-fighting, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Stressing that charter flights can never be better than the
opening of direct cross-strait air links, Wu called for the Beijing
leadership to remove political barriers so that cross-strait
negotiations on direct air links can be started before long.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks after he attended a seminar sponsored by the
quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation on China's investment
climate and Taiwan investors' strategies.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan companies and businesspeople have channeled some
US$150 billion into China in various investment projects, making it
imperative that their investments there are protected under an
investment guarantee mechanism.</P>
      <P>Taiwan keenly hopes that cross-strait negotiations will be
resumed soon to also discuss other issues, including the exemption of
double taxation, protection of intellectual property rights,
cross-strait judicial support, and the repatriation of illegal
immigrants, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu noted that the 2007 Chinese New Year cross-strait
charter flights will be implemented from Feb. 5 for 28 days under the
principles established June 14.</P>
      <P>A total of 96 charter flights will be available to facilitate
China-based Taiwan businesspeople returning home for the holiday. Six
China-based carriers and six Taiwan-based carriers will offer flight
services on routes connecting Taoyuan, Kaohsiung, Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou and Xiamen, Wu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP, KMT SPAT OVER CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION ON PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling party's lawmakers claimed
Thursday they were asking for grand justices' interpretation of
Article 52 of the Constitution not for the sake of President Chen
Shui-bian but for the sake of ensuring that the government can run
under a good system, an argument that the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
said is simply off the point.</P>
      <P>Article 52 gives the president immunity from criminal prosecution
while in office, a privilege that the DPP's legislative caucus said
must not be given up in order to ensure the smooth operation of the
government.</P>
      <P>"In the future, whoever is the president, if he or she abandons
the constitutional immunity, unimaginable consequences will ensue and
similar political strife will never end, " warned Ker Chien-ming,
convener of the DPP caucus.</P>
      <P>He stressed that his caucus' petition requesting suspension of a
court trial of first lady Wu Shu-jen was aimed at protecting the
judicial system, and not the president.</P>
      <P>But the DPP caucus petition, filed on the eve of the court's
scheduled trial concerning Wu's suspected involvement in the alleged
misuse of the president's special "state affairs fund, " left the KMT
caucus unconvinced.</P>
      <P>The KMT caucus claimed that the court is going to try the
president's wife, not him, on Friday and so the DPP caucus' petition
was totally off base, and it could even be suspected of attempting to
interfere with the judicial authorities.</P>
      <P>Wu and several of the president's senior aides were indicted on
charges of embezzlement, forgery and perjury in connection with the
investigations into the "state affairs fund" scandal.</P>
      <P>The prosecution found that Wu had used receipts offered by other
people to claim reimbursement totalling NT$14.8 million (US$450,000)
between July 2002 and March 2006 from the "state affairs fund"
budgeted for the president's discretionary use.</P>
      <P>Calling the PDP caucus "a busybody, " KMT Legislator Wu Yang-chih
said the Presidential Office's legal hook is none of the business of
the PDP legislative caucus.</P>
      <P>Wu said the president himself has pledged to step down if his
wife is found guilty of embezzlement or forgery in the first trial.
"If he really has any respect for the law, why is he trying to stop
the court from trying his wife?" Wu asked.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Wu asked in what capacity the DPP caucus was filing the
petition for constitutional interpretation, noting that the law
stipulates that a lawmaker cannot request a constitutional
interpretation unless it involves a dispute over the exercise of
his/her legislator's duties.</P>
      <P>Ker argued that his caucus was within its rights to file such a
petition as the legislature, which is dominated by the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and People First Party, was involved
in legislating an unconstitutional law that authorizes prosecution of
the president and the vice president for suspected violation of the
election law.</P>
      <P>Another KMT lawmaker, Kao Sze-po, retorted that the legislation
on a special prosecutor's investigations into alleged corruption and
dereliction of duty by senior officials including the president and
vice president was passed under a consensus of the ruling and
opposition parties.</P>
      <P>"Now the DPP is slapping its own face by filing a petition to
challenge the law's constitutionality," Kao claimed.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yi-jin, secretary-general of the DPP caucus, pointed out that
by filing such a petition, her caucus actually was telling the
president that he had made mistakes by agreeing to being questioned
by the prosecutor in 2004 over a local election dispute and in 2006
over his role in the "state affairs fund" case.</P>
      <P>"We decided to request a grand justices' interpretation to
preserve the dignity and the spirit of constitutional democracy" she
said, adding that it does not have anything to do with the first
lady's scheduled court trial.</P>

      <P>Taipei is one of the Asian cities with
"excellent" capability to manage air quality, according to a report
released recently by the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The other six cities with "excellent" air quality management

      <P>The study, focusing on the air pollution of 22 Asian cities, was
backed by the U.N. Environment Programme and was published ahead of
the first governmental meeting on urban air quality opening Wednesday
in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.</P>
      <P>The study rated Beijing, Busan and New Delhi as having "good" air
quality management capability and rated Colombo, Ho Chi Minh City,
Jakarta, Manila and Mumbai as having "moderate" management
capability.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Dhaka, Hanoi, Surabaya and Kathmandu have "limited"
capability to manage air quality, the report said.</P>
      <P>The report said that although most of these Asian cities have
been able to reduce the emissions of key pollutants, pollution caused
by fine particulate matter remains a problem owing to the rapid rise
in the number of motor vehicles.</P>
      <P>In particular, the concentrations of particulate matter up to 10
micrometers in size (PM10) are "serious" in Beijing, Dhaka, Hanoi, Ho
Chi Minh City, Jakarta, Kathmandu, Kolkata, New Delhi and Shanghai,
the report said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By Lillian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Justice Shih Mao-lin said
Thursday that he hopes more medical resources will be devoted to
prisons or penitentiaries to help combat drug crimes.</P>
      <P>Shih made the remarks while attending a seminar on drug
rehabilitation, during which he also said that cooperation between
judicial and medical systems will mean a big step forward in
combating the drug problem in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shih cited statistics to show around 80 percent of
larcenies and burglaries in Taiwan are drug-related, and
drug users also account for more than 60 percent of AIDS patients.</P>
      <P>For drug offenders, the question is not where to detain them, but
how to do something to help adjust their character and even behavior,
which he said would require more medical resources.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan has defined drug criminals as both
criminals and patients since 1998, but has been unable to put the
concept into practice because there has not been enough medical
resources to back it up. </P>
      <P>He said that the inmates are most in need of health education,
citing 300 juvenile delinquents in a Taoyuan prison as an example,
saying that a lot of them have learning difficulties or mental
diseases, and if
medical resources could help them back on track, then the risk
they pose to society would be greatly reduced.</P>

every citizen, Lee Nan-yang said the first lady will show up at court
Friday as scheduled unless her doctors prohibit her from doing so out
of health considerations.</P>
      <P>As of Thursday afternoon, Wu's doctors have not made any
suggestions that Wu should not appear in court because of health
reasons, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Wu was indicted Nov. 3 on charges of embezzlement and forgery in
a scandal involving the misuse of a special "state affairs fund"
budgeted for the president's discretionary use.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors decided to indict Wu after discovering that she had
used invoices collected from family members and others to claim
NT$14.8 million in reimbursements from the state affairs fund between
July 2002 and March 2006.</P>
      <P>Chen was named along with Wu as a "joint perpetrator" but was not
charged because of his constitutional immunity while in office as the
head of state. He has denied any wrongdoing, claiming that the use of
invoices belonging to other people was to cover expenses incurred in
"secret diplomatic programs."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT SAYS HE IS SERIOUS ABOUT MOVING TO KAOHSIUNG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday the
idea of moving to the southern city of Kaohsiung was not raised on
the spur of the moment but was instead a "very serious" one.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in the latest issue of his online
newsletter. He was referring to a promise made by his wife, Wu
Shu-jen, during the run-up to last week's Kaohsiung mayoral election
that the first family would buy housing in the port city if
Democratic Progressive Party candidate Chen Chu won the election.</P>
      <P>Chen Chu was elected to the mayoral post Dec. 9 by capturing
49.41 percent of the vote, leading her main opponent, Huang Chun-ying
of the Kuomintang, by only 1,114 votes.</P>
      <P>Likening the passion of Kaohsiung people to the warm sunshine,
President Chen said he and his wife have long been looking forward to
moving there.</P>
      <P>Also, Chen said he and his wife very much admire the pride
displayed by Kaohsiung people for their hometown, which he said has
made major progress in various ways in recent years.</P>
      <P>"It would be a kind of happiness to be able to move to Kaohsiung
and become neighbors with all of you. We are very thankful to the
people of Kaohsiung for giving us the chance to fulfill our dream, "
Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the support offered by Kaohsiung voters to
Chen Chu proves that a person with excellent ability will definitely
succeed.</P>
      <P>The election outcome also demonstrates Kaohsiung residents'
approval for former Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh of the DPP and his
achievements in promoting the city's development, the president said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The results of a local study have indicated
that botulinum toxin is effective in treating migraine headaches, in
addition to removing wrinkles, researchers said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The study, jointly conducted by six major medical centers in 2002
on 60 patients suffering from severe migraine, showed that patients
saw a significant decrease in the frequency and intensity of their
migraine after they were injected with 0.5 c.c. to 1 c.c. of
botulinum toxin at the exact spots of pain.</P>
      <P>Researchers noted that approximately 1.5 million people over 15
of age in Taiwan suffer from migraines, and that these patients
usually display symptoms of nausea, vomiting and fear of light and
noise, besides severe headache.</P>
      <P>Chen Jou-hsien, a neurologist at Linkou Chang Gung Memorial
Hospital, said migraine patients who have at least four relapses per
week can consider receiving botulinum toxin therapy if they do not
want to receive long-term preventive medication.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the effect of one botulinum toxin therapy can
last up to three months, with each therapy costing NT$8,000 to

    <DATELINE>Los Angeles,  Dec. 13 (CNA)
(By Lu-sheng Chu and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A six-year-old leukemia patient from
Taiwan has met and hugged a U.S. astronaut as he had wished, the
Make-A-Wish Foundation said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Six-year-old Kao-yuan Chen wished he could watch the launch of a
spaceship and hug an astronaut and had expressed this to the
Make-A-Wish Foundation, which vows to grant the wishes of children
around the world with life-threatening medical conditions, to enrich
the human experience with hope, strength and joy.</P>
      <P>Before Chen met and hugged U.S. astronaut Gordon Fullerton at a
special event in Los Angeles Tuesday, under arrangements by the
foundation the six-year-old also visited the Kennedy Space Center in
Cape Canaveral in Florida several days ago.</P>
      <P>At the space center, Chen was wearing an astronaut suit, an
astronaut helmet and a look of great excitement, according to a video
shown by the foundation at the event.</P>
      <P>Fullerton also gave the boy a high-power telescope, which will
allow him to gaze at the stars from his home in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Among some 10 children from around the world that the foundation
helped realize their heartfelt wishes this year, Chen was the only
child from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Since 1980, the Make-A-Wish Foundation has enriched the lives of
children with life-threatening medical conditions through its
wish-granting work. The Foundation's mission reflects the
life-changing impact that a Make-A-Wish experience has on children,
families, referral sources, donors, sponsors and entire communities.</P>
      <P>The Make-A-Wish Foundation was founded in 1980 after a young boy
named Chris Greicius realized his heartfelt wish to become a police
officer. Since its humble beginnings, the organization has blossomed
into a worldwide phenomenon, reaching more than 144,000 children
around the world.</P>
      <P>A network of more than 25,000 volunteers enable the Make-A-Wish
Foundation to serve children with life-threatening medical
conditions. Volunteers serve as wish granters, fundraisers, special

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
Thursday welcomed reports that Japan plans to recognize the
international driver's licence issued by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ministry said in a press release that it has promoted the
matter for quite some time, and was gratified to receive a positive
response from Japan.</P>
      <P>The MOFA attributed the reason to the high calibre of Taiwanese
tourists as well as their high spending capabilities.</P>
      <P>The ministry's press release came after reports that Japan's
National Police Agency decided Tuesday to submit for approval a
revised traffic bill to the Japanese Diet next spring,
which will allow Taiwanese tourists to drive in Japan if they possess
a Taiwan-issued international driver's license.</P>
      <P>The new measure will promote bilateral economic benefits, given
the fact that Taiwanese and Japanese pay nearly 2.5 million
visits to each other's country every year.</P>
      <P>The MOFA also said this is another piece of good news after
Japan waived its visa requirement for Taiwan tourists in

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Defense Minister Ko Chen-heng said
Thursday that the Ministry of National Defense is still planning to
curtail the compulsory military service period to one year by the end
of 2008, but added that this will be based on the premise that the
volunteer recruitment goal can be achieved smoothly.</P>
      <P>Ko made the remarks while reporting to a Legislative Yuan
committee on the situation surrounding recruiting volunteer military
servicemen as well as the plan to adjust the term of compulsory
military service.</P>
      <P>He noted that President Chen Shui-bian and the MND have said
previously that the compulsory military service period will be
shortened to one year by the end of 2008, but he also said that
judging from the present situation, there does not seem to be room
for further shortening compulsory military service in 2007.</P>
      <P>He also said that the ministry will make a final assessment by
the end of 2007 on the exact timing of the adjustment.</P>
      <P>The MND had planned to recruit 6,561 servicemen in 2005, but
actually accepted 6,644. It had planned to recruit 13,500 this year
and had so far accepted 8,164.</P>
      <P>Ko was responding to Legislator Lin Yu-fang of the opposition
Kuomintang, who asked about media reports that compulsory military
service will be shortened to 14 months from the present 16 months
next year and will be further cut to one year by 2008.</P>
      <P>Lin said the MND should keep the public abreast of the situation
so that future draftees can make their career plans accordingly.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two draft bills designed to force the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) to return its "ill-gotten" assets to the
national coffers got nowhere in the Legislative Yuan Thursday after a
joint meeting of three committees adjourned in chaos.</P>
      <P>The two bills -- one submitted by the Executive Yuan and the
other by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party -- were supposed to
be discussed by the joint meeting of the Home and Nations Committee,
the Judiciary Committee, the Finance Committee and the Organic Laws
and Statutes Committee.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of the sitting, Legislator Yeh Yi-jin, secretary
of the DPP legislative caucus, appealed to her KMT colleagues to
debate unemotionally the bills that were crafted to settle the assets
problem, which is deeply rooted in the country's unique history.</P>
      <P>However, her appeal fell on deaf ears of the KMT committee
members, who claimed that the bills are part of what they described
as "the DPP's political scheme to monopolize political power," citing
its "shady governance, " and its attempts to seek permanent immunity
from criminal charges for scandal-ridden President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The claims drew fierce rebuttals from DPP lawmakers and ended in
bickering, with DPP lawmakers unfolding posters denouncing the KMT in
the chamber and KMT lawmakers responding by motioning for an
adjournment.</P>
      <P>The motion triggered chaos on the floor, with DPP lawmakers
occupying the podium in attempts to stop the chairman of the session,
DPP Legislator Kao Chien-chih, from acting on the adjournment motion
and KMT lawmakers trying to reclaim the podium to push the chairman
to put their motion to a vote.</P>
      <P>After realizing that the individuals involved were incapable of
holding a debate, Kao put the sitting into recess.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Dec.  14  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The camp of the main opposition
Kuomintang's (KMT's) candidate in the Dec. 9 Kaohsiung mayoral race
called Thursday for a new election if vote-buying allegations made by
a rival camp are proven untrue.</P>
      <P>Lee Liang-chien, spokesman for the campaign headquarters of Huang
Chun-ying, issued the call at a news conference after a case in which
a videotape showing alleged vote-buying aboard a bus by Huang's
workers took new turns in recent days.</P>
      <P>A man shot in the film giving money to passengers aboard the bus,
which was waiting to leave for a campaign rally, told prosecutors
that he gave away NT$500 in cash to each passenger to buy their votes
for a "certain" candidate</P>
      <P>The camp of Chen Chu, candidate of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and Kaohsiung mayor-elect, made public the
videotape late on the eve of the election and accused Hung of
vote-buying -- which the Huang camp claimed was slander that led to
his loss in the election.</P>
      <P>Huang lost the election by a margin of only 0.14 percent -- or
just 1,114 votes -- to Chen.</P>
      <P>Lee said that they strongly suspected that the videotape was set
up by Chen's camp with the aim of ruining Huang's election bid and
that he demanded that Chen promise to hold a new election if the
content of the film is proven untrue.</P>
      <P>Lawyers from the Huang camp have filed a suit to clear his name
and have demanded that the court invalidate Chen's election victory
and recount the votes. They also demanded the Central Election
Commission put a temporary hold on Chen's election as Kaohsiung
mayor, slated for Dec. 15.</P>
      <P>Hung Chih-kun, director of Chen's election campaign office, urged

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT AGAINST RAISING CHINA INVESTMENT CEILING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
people are "putting the cart before the horse" when they argue that
the government should lift the 40-percent ceiling on Taiwan
investment in China.</P>
      <P>Instead, Chen said, they should look at the issue from the
opposite perspective by pondering how to increase investment in
Taiwan instead of China, and they should seek to overcome barriers to
investment in Taiwan instead of "blindly" challenging the
government's restrictions on investment in China.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during a meeting at the Presidential Office
with a group of businessmen from home and overseas Chinese and
Taiwanese communities who have performed exceptionally during
business start-ups.</P>
      <P>He said that benefiting from the recovery of the world economies,
Taiwan's domestic economy has regained momentum, with growth of 5.02
percent posted in the third quarter and growth for the entire year
expected to be between 4.3 percent and 4.6 percent, plus an
unemployment rate that is likely to be controlled under 4 percent for
this year.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan's Powerchip Semiconductor Corp. (PSC) and
the Japanese Elpida Memory Inc. signed an MOU in Taipei Dec. 7 to
establish a joint venture in central Taiwan for DRAM production. When
the PSC-Elpida DRAM fabrication facilities -- to be located in the
Central Taiwan Science Park -- begin commercial operations in four to
five years -- the new joint venture will be the world's largest
12-inch chip wafer foundry, with a total planned capacity of 240,000
wafers per month.</P>
      <P>The president said this joint venture also represents three major
points.</P>
      <P>First, he said, despite the efforts of Singapore and China to
offer attractive packages for such a large-scale investment project,
Elpida decided to choose Taiwan as the joint venture's location and
to tie up with PSC, reflecting the importance that Elpida attaches to
Taiwan's and PSC's competitiveness in terms of semiconductor
manufacturing.</P>
      <P>Second, these new DRAM fabrication facilities, carrying a
pricetag of NT$450 billion (US$13.85 billion), represent the largest
investment project in Taiwan since the government put forth a "mega
investment, mega warmth" plan early this year, and also the largest
single investment project in Taiwan's history, he said.</P>
      <P>Third, he went on, in order to facilitate the joint venture,
relevant government agencies have been striving in a short period of
just nine months to complete all the paperwork required, including
land requisition and environmental impact assessments, a record in
this regard in the history of the development of Taiwan's
science-based industrial parks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW ALIGNMENT WITH PFP STIRS DEBATE WITHIN KMT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As the biggest party in the opposition
"pan-blue alliance, " it is normal that Kuomintang (KMT) members
differ on the issue of whether to form a formal alignment with the
People First Party (PFP), KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while answering questions from reporters
after a meeting of the KMT's Central Standing Committee (CSC) the
previous day failed to reach a consensus on the issue.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the issue must be eventually settled within the
decision-making CSC, Ma said it is important that KMT members are
able to freely air their viewpoints and that it is no surprise that
party members hold different stances on the issue.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, a KMT heavyweight,
contended that PFP Chairman James Soong should not retire from
politics, despite his recent announcement to do so shortly after he
conceded defeat in the Dec. 9 Taipei mayoral race.</P>
      <P>Soong must stay on to help the PFP consolidate with the KMT, Wang
said, adding that if he fails to do so, the PFP-KMT merger might get
into trouble and further hobble Taiwan's political development.</P>
      <P>Wang also denied rampant speculation that he will form a KMT
ticket with Chairman Ma Ying-jeou to run in the 2008 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>But according to PFP officials, Soong remains firm on his
decision to withdraw from the political scene and the only thing that
concerns him now is the future of some PFP lawmakers. It is hard for
Soong to "leave them like this, " the officials said, although they
added that it is true that some PFP lawmakers might not be willing to
join or return to the KMT.</P>
      <P>Once the PFP and the KMT have wrapped up their negotiations on
forming a new political alliance, Soong will really be free from his
"moral duty" as head of the PFP by that time, they said.</P>
      <P>While Soong has no preference for any specific model to conduct
consolidation talks with the KMT, the KMT effectively holds the key
on putting negotiation results into practice, the officials
explained.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that Soong decided to retire from politics "out
of respect for the public mandate, " he can still help bridge
differences between PFP lawmakers and the KMT before he really bids
farewell to the party, they said.</P>
      <P>Soong garnered only a little over 50,000 votes in the recent
Taipei mayoral race, ranking a distant third among the six
candidates.</P>

re-examination of his request to return to his job as a doctor at the
National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH).</P>
      <P>Lee Chun-sheng, chief of the CSPTC Division of Protection, said
the commission will take about three months to examine, screen and
discuss Chao's re-examination appeal, which he filed last week after
an earlier request to return to his job as an orthopedic surgeon at
the NTUH was rejected by the medical center.</P>
      <P>The screening period could be extended for two more months if
necessary, in accordance with regulations, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The NTUH voted down in mid-October Chao's request on the grounds
he had "seriously violated medical ethics."</P>
      <P>Chao was suspended when he was indicted on insider-trading
charges in July, charges that are still being handled in court. On
Oct. 9, he filed an application with the NTU Hospital requesting
reinstatement.</P>
      <P>The request was rejected after three polls were held by the
hospital's Clinical Ethics Committee, Department of Orthopedic
Surgery and finally by hospital management, all of which voted
overwhelmingly against allowing Chao to return. The last vote was 57
versus one, with one abstention.</P>
      <P>The hospital said participants in the three meetings "unanimously
agreed" that Chao's behavior was in severe violation of medical
ethics and damaging to the hospital's reputation, therefore rendering
him "unfit to be an NTU Hospital doctor." Honesty and integrity are
part of the hospital's core values, said a hospital spokesman.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors have demanded an eight-year sentence for Chao. His
father, Chao Yu-chu, also charged in the same Taiwan Development
Corp. stock-trading scandal, deserves a 10-year jail term, according
to the indictment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROTEST HELD AGAINST NCC CLAMPDOWN ON ILLEGAL RADIO STATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hundreds of independence supporters staged
a protest Thursday in front of the National Communications Commission
(NCC) against its clampdown on unlicensed radio stations.</P>
      <P>Protesters mobilized by various pro-independence groups,
including the Taiwan Independence Party, argued that the NCC's
ongoing campaign against pirate radio stations is part of a plot
mounted by pro-China media organizations to seize all broadcasting
resources.</P>
      <P>The crowds charged the NCC's establishment as "unconstitutional"
on the grounds that it should be an independent agency free from
political interference. The NCC's current lineup was formed in
proportion to the number of seats that each of the major political
parties controls in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>They also blasted the NCC's decision to refer a case regarding
President Chen Shui-bian's televised remarks about vote-buying on the
Dec. 9 polling day of the municipal elections in Taipei and Kaohsiung
to the Central Election Commission, saying that doing so is in
violation of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Because the NCC is an unconstitutional organization, it is not
entitled to handle any dispute related to media, the protesters
claimed. They also demanded that all NCC members step down to allow
for the establishment of a fair environment for Taiwan's media.</P>
      <P>Wang Hsing-nan and Yen Wen-chang, lawmakers of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , were also present during the
hour-long demonstration.</P>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" has accused Chen of making the
televised comments in an attempt to influence the elections, in
particular the mayoral election in Kaohsiung, which the DPP viewed as
a critical battle to secure a chance of victory in the 2008
presidential election.</P>
      <P>NCC Chairman Su Yeong-chin said earlier the same day at a
legislative committee that his commission plans to eradicate some 50
unlicensed radio stations in the coming year. More than 100 such
pirate stations have already been wiped out since early this year, he
noted.</P>
      <P>Unlicensed radio stations, more rampant in southern Taiwan,
create many social problems, as most of them sell fake medicine or
spread false information, especially in the runups to elections,
Su claimed.</P>

Wall Street Journal:On Death Row,
Fate of Mentally Ill Is Thorny Problem

Mr. Thompson is on death row at the Riverbend
Maximum Security Institution, and like many prison
inmates, he is mentally ill. Today, his case is at
the center of a complex debate about the death
penalty in the U.S. Recently, the Supreme Court
ruled that mentally retarded defendants and
juveniles cannot be sentenced to death. Mr.
Thompson is asking the courts to decide whether
mentally ill prisoners can be executed if rendered
competent only by medication. His twice-delayed
execution and similar cases are working through
the judicial system; one will likely end up in
front of the high court.</TEXT>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By T.C. Jiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The output of Taiwan's communications
industry is expected to surpass NT$706.5 billion this
year, representing a 43 growth year-on-year, according to a
forecast released Thursday by the Industrial Technology Research
Institute (ITRI) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>The forecast was made at a two-day symposium that opened the
previous day in Taipei on the review and outlook of Taiwan's
electronics industry under the sponsorship of the ITRI's Industrial
Economics and Knowledge Center (IEK) and the MOEA's Industrial
Technology Information Service (ITIS).</P>
      <P>The IEK-ITIS project predicted that this year's top five products
will be mobile phones, GPS products, WLAN products, DSL CPE products
and SOHO routers.</P>
      <P>Chang Huai-chi, the project's research manager, said the
development of cell phones is still the focus while forecasting that
the total number of mobile phones to be manufactured in 2007 will
reach 140 million.</P>
      <P>Chang added that 3G cell phones will become focus products.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the next wave of the global communication
industry will center on the integration of various functions.</P>
      <P>For instance, cell phones can already be used as digital cameras
and music players he said, adding that in the future, they can
function as GPS navigators and TVs.</P>
      <P>The number of 3G cell phone users in 2006 reached 390 million
with an annual rise of 100 million subscribers, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The number of 3G cell phone users next year is likely to be 520
million, accounting for 18 percent of all mobile phone subscribers,
Chang predicted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KINMEN COAST GUARD DISPERSES INTRUDING CHINESE FISHING BOATS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen, Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Five Chinese fishing boats have been seized
in the past few days while poaching elvers in waters surrounding the
Taiwan-held outlying island of Kinmen, local coast guard authorities
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The onset of winter brings the start of the elver season to
Kinmen waters and Chinese fishing boats often intruded into Kinmen
waters to poach, enraging the Kinmen fishermen and threatening
navigation safety of ferry boats plying the direct "mini three links"
route between Kinmen and Xiamen in China's coastal Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen coast guard corps has joined forces with the Kinmen
county government in mounting several rounds of a crackdown on
Chinese poachers in recent days to protect the country's fishery
resources and maintain coastal safety, coast guard officers said.</P>
      <P>In addition to expelling Chinese fishing boats from Kinmen
waters, coast guard patrol boats also seized five Chinese boats for
serious legal infractions. Four Chinese fishermen from two of the
ships may be indicted in accordance with the statute governing
exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, Kinmen officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, nine Chinese fishermen aboard three fhsing boats from
Fujian which were caught poaching in Kinmen waters earlier this week
were repatriated earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Coast guard officials said they have traditionally stepped up
maritime patrol and coastal investigations from Nov. 1 through the
end of February to prevent elver poaching and maintain coastal
safety.</P>
