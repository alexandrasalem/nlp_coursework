    <HEADLINE>FORMER EDUCATION MINISTER RELEASED ON NT$2 MILLION BAIL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Education Minister Yang Chao-hsiang,
who had been subpoenaed for questioning for alleged involvement in a
bribery and corruption case, was released Wednesday morning on NT$2
million (US$57,637) bail, to Taipei law enforcement sources
reported.</P>
      <P>Yang was one of 14 people, including several former officials
from the Ministry of Education (MOE), who were recently subpoenaed by
Taipei district prosecutors for questioning about their suspected
involvement in the notorious Jin Wen Academy bribery and corruption
scandal that erupted last year.</P>
      <P>Yang was questioned on charges of receiving bribes from board
members of Jin Wen Academy so as to help smooth upgrading the former
high school to an academy and an illegal development project of the
Taipei County school, including the development of residential
houses.</P>
      <P>The former education minister was required by prosecutors to
produce sufficient documents and related evidence in three days to
prove that a luxurious residence he owns that was built by the Jin
Wen Group was purchased at a justifiable price.</P>
      <P>Also on Wednesday, Huang Cheng-chieh, a former MOE department
director, was released on NT$300,000 (US$8,646) bail after an
overnight questioning session, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Former Vice Education Minister Lin Chao-hsien had been arrested
in May on similar corruption charges. He was released later on NT$2
million bail.</P>
      <P>Chairman and CEO of the Jin Wen Group, Chang Wan-li, who is also
wanted by prosecutors for fraud and bribery charges, has reportedly
fled to Canada.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VILLAGERS IN DANGEROUS AREAS SHOULD CONSIDER RESETTLING: CEPD HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairman of the Cabinet-level Council
for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) suggested on Wednesday
that residents of villages in geologically unsafe areas around the
island should consider moving permanently to different locations.</P>
      <P>Chen Poh-chih said these residents should think about resettling
so as to avoid being the victims of natural disasters such as that
wrought by Typhoon Toraji which swept across the island Monday.</P>
      <P>The chairman said a CEPD ad hoc task force will be established
shortly in order to tackle geological and conservation issues,
particularly resolving the problem of landslides and mud-flows on a
permanent basis.</P>
      <P>He quoted tallies compiled by the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture as indicating that there are more than 50 villages
islandwide, most inhabited by aboriginal groups, located in
geologically dangerous areas, such as along river banks, on
mountainsides or at the mouths of rivers.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive resettlement plan to be mapped out by the CEPD
task force is expected to become available in a week, and the actual
implementation of the plan should begin some time next year at the
earliest, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>He added that not all the villages' residents should move, saying
that many of the villages will become safe to live in after work on
reinforcing related facilities protecting against natural disasters
is carried out.</P>
      <P>Before any resettlement plan is carried out, Chen said, all
relevant factors must first be considered and dealt with, including
the villagers' feelings about resettling, their prospects for making
an adequate living following resettlement, as well as other cultural
and social issues.</P>
      <P>The CEPD ad hoc task force will also solicit opinions and
suggestions from specialists in the fields of geography and geology
and from experts in the areas of local customs, practices and culture
when drafting a resettlement plan, Chen noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS LAUNCH NEW DRIVE TO HELP KIDS IN TYPHOON-STRICKEN AREAS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   1   (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
legislators launched a campaign Wednesday to help children orphaned
in the recent typhoon disaster.</P>
      <P>Legislators Ting Shou-chung, Hung Hsiu-chu and Tina Wei-kang Pan
urged candidates of all political stripes for the year-end elections
for legislators and local government chiefs to cut spending on
campaign literature and use the money instead to sponsor children in
areas hardest-hit by Typhoon Toraji.</P>
      <P>Ting pointed out that Toraji has inflicted heavy human casualties
and property damage on Taiwan, particularly in the central county of
Nantou and the eastern county of Hualien.</P>
      <P>"In view of the government's limited financial and manpower
resources, we have launched the drive to urge those who intend to run
in the legislative and local government chief elections scheduled for
December to reduce the number of their campaign posters, banners and
other publicity materials and use the money to sponsor orphans in the
typhoon-stricken areas until they can complete university education,"
Ting said.</P>
      <P>Ting noted that candidates for public elections tend to spend
hundreds of thousands, or even millions of new Taiwan dollars on
campaign literature.</P>
      <P>"We hope that all hopefuls in the December elections will spend
less on campaign pamphlets and show more concern and offer more
assistance to typhoon victims," Ting urged at a news conference.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Hung said many local people have
become fed up with the political wrangling and lip services of
Taiwan's politicians.</P>
      <P>"It's time for political figures to improve their public image,"
Hung said, adding that spending less on campaign vans and printed
publicity materials and using the money saved to help young typhoon
victims would be a good way to help politicians win popular support.</P>
      <P>Pan echoed Hung's views, saying that money saved by reduced
campaign literature could help finance living expenses and school
tuition fees of children orphaned in the typhoon.</P>
      <P>"We hope that all hopefuls intending to run in the year-end
elections, regardless of their party affiliation or political
stripes, can join our campaign to help more children in
typhoon-stricken areas," Pan said.</P>
      <P>The three lawmakers also announced that they would sponsor the
children bereaved by firefighter Lee Chi-jung and police officer Lin
Teh-fu, both of whom were killed in typhoon relief operations in the
eastern county of Hualien, one of the hardest-hit regions.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Toraji battered Taiwan with gusty winds and torrential
rain Monday, leaving at least 69 people dead and 138 others missing,
according to official tallies as of Wednesday morning.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan exported US$6.85 billion-worth of
products and services to Japan in the first five months of this year,
a slight decrease of 2.36 percent from the same period of last year,
sources from the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>While almost all categories of Japan-bound Taiwan exports posted
reductions in the January-May period, the exports of electrical
machinery showed remarkable growth, BOFT officials noted.</P>
      <P>The officials attributed the commendable growth in exports of
electrical machinery mainly to growth in the export of integrated
circuit (IC) products.</P>
      <P>These exports, valued at US$1.91 billion in the first five
months, represented an increase of 17.14 percent over the figure
posted in the same period of the previous year, BOFT officials said.</P>
      <P>They noted, however, that similar exports by Taiwan's major rival
-- South Korea -- increased by 20.05 percent.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exports of machine tools and optical instruments to Japan
were down 10.87 percent and 14.96 percent year-on-year, respectively,
in the five-month period, while exports of Taiwan-made fishery
products, plastics and household products to Japan also diminished by
a two-digit rate in the same period, the officials added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT TO WATCH CLOSELY FORMER CHAIRMAN'S DEEDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will watch
closely the deeds of former KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui when he attends
the inauguration of a new political party, a KMT official said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chao Shou-po, director general of the KMT's Organization and
Development Committee, made the remarks one day after Konsin. C.
Shah, a member of the KMT old guard, cut himself on the arm during a
party meeting to demonstrate the strength of his desire to see Lee
expelled from the party.</P>
      <P>Chao said that when Lee attends the inauguration of the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU), the KMT will watch "what he does and what he
says."</P>
      <P>The TSU will be headed by former Minister of the Interior Huang
Chu-wen, who is closely affiliated with Lee. The former chairman has
raised the ire of KMT members by saying that he will help the
minority government of President Chen Shui-bian gain a stable
majority in the year-end legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Chao said that the views on the matter within the party at
present are polarized and that the KMT has to be careful how it
handles the matter, adding that as long as there is substantial
evidence against Lee, the KMT disciplinary committee will start an
investigation.</P>
      <P>Vice President of the Legislative Yuan Yao Eng-chi also said that
the KMT must stress solidarity and tolerance at present. Only if Lee
openly stumps for candidates of other political parties and
jeopardizes the survival of the KMT, he said, will the party decide
to take action.</P>
      <P>Yao, who met with Chao Wednesday, said that any decision on
whether to expel Lee will be left to the disciplinary committee. If
Lee's deeds jeopardize the survival and development of the party,
then the KMT will definitely take action, he added.</P>
      <P>Yao said that the KMT is "still the center of political
stability" in the nation and has made the greatest contribution to
the country. He added his hope that those who have split from the KMT
will come back to its fold.</P>
      <P>According to Chao, the inauguration of the TSU is basically a
"social event" in which Lee and figures from other political parties
will participate. Lee's attendance therefore cannot be construed as
stumping for TSU candidates, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>`NO MORE ROOM FOR TAX CUTS': DPP LEGISLATOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Chien Hsi-chieh of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Wednesday that "there is no
more room for the government to cut taxes."</P>
      <P>Chien made the remarks at a press conference in the wake of calls
by industrial and business groups in the ongoing Economic Development
Advisory Conference (EDAC) for the cutting or abolishment of six
taxes.</P>
      <P>According to Chien, Taiwan, with an average tax rate of 12.7
percent, is the "least burdened country in the world in terms of
taxes," and with a government budget deficit of more than NT$400
billion (US$11.49 billion), there is no room for the government to
further cut taxes.</P>
      <P>The government should therefore silence interest groups that
continue to suggest tax cuts, Chien went on.</P>
      <P>He cited Lin Chuang, director-general of the Directorate General
of Budget, Accounting &amp; Statistics, who warned earlier that with a
budget deficit of up to NT$400 billion, the government is not
expected to be able to make ends meet for the next decade under the
current tax system, let alone if further cuts are implemented.</P>
      <P>Chien criticized the trade and industry groups for "only seeking
their own interests" in proposing tax cuts, adding that the act would
not benefit the general public and would not encourage consumption.</P>
      <P>Professor Tseng Chu-wei of National Chengchi University opposed
tax cuts, stressing that they should not be used to "bail out" the
government.</P>
      <P>Taipei University Professor Huang Shih-hsin also vehemently
opposed the cuts, but said that the enterprises should not be
criticized too heavily. He added that the social responsibility of
Taiwan businesses lags behind developed countries and it is "a joke"
for the government to let them play such a big role in its decision
making process.</P>

from defecting to work for the mainland government or its People's
Liberation Army (PLA).</P>
      <P>"We must formulate stringent regulations to block our career
soldiers and civil servants from defecting to work for the mainland
authorities," Chang said, adding that the CPA should produce a
comprehensive report on possible measures in two weeks.</P>
      <P>Chang's directive came after a local newspaper reported recently
that mainland China is considering taking advantage of Taiwan's
decision to reduce its troops by courting retired Republic of China
military officers to work for the PLA. The report drew government
attention and concern.</P>
      <P>Noting that establishing a modern, elite deterrent force is one
of the government's major policy goals, Chang said the ROC military
will continue its personnel trimming and organization restructuring
work.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he went on, the military should refine its strategy
and practice in carrying out the work.</P>
      <P>The premier also asked the MND and the VAC to strengthen
services, concern and care for all military servicemen to consolidate
their loyalty to the country.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chief of the General Staff Tang Yao-ming also
encouraged all military servicemen to dedicate themselves to serving
the country during an inspection tour of the Navy General
Headquarters.</P>
      <P>Tang explained in a speech to all officers and men why the ROC
must beep up its defense capabilities in the face of mainland China's
ever-increasing military threat.</P>
      <P>He also again debunked the recent newspaper report that had
aroused so much concern, denying that a retired ROC army officer has
defected to work for the PLA. Tang stressed that all ROC military
servicemen must uphold their loyalty to the national cause.</P>
      <P>Tang made a similar inspection tour of the Air Force General
Headquarters last week and is scheduled to inspect the Army General
Headquarters next week.</P>
      <P>Military authorities said the tours are routine.</P>
      <P>As for recent speculation about a possible reshuffle of military
brass, the Ministry of National Defense said it is the ministry's
established policy to refrain from commenting on military personnel
changes before they are formally approved by relevant authorities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>UMC TO SHIFT PRODUCTION TO 12-INCH WAFERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>United Microelectronics (UMC) Chairman
Robert Tsao said Tuesday that Taiwan's leading semiconductor foundry
will shift the emphasis of its production capacity from 8-inch wafers
to 12-inch wafers.</P>
      <P>He added that 12-inch chips are expected to account for half of
the corporation's chip output by 2003.</P>
      <P>At an investor conference, Tsao said that for the first half of
2001, UMC posted net sales amounting to NT$38.596 billion, with net
income totaling NT$4.62 billion and basic earnings per share reaching
NT$0.4.</P>
      <P>The corporation suffered a NT$3.05 billion loss before income tax
in the second quarter. Tsao said that revenues in the third quarter
will continue to decline from the level of the second quarter.</P>
      <P>He added, however, that he expects revenues to bottom out in the
third quarter and improvements will be seen in the fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>Tsao pointed out that the semiconductor sector is facing the
worst recession since 1985 and a speedy recovery before 2003 is very
unlikely.</P>
      <P>Due to the global over-capacity situation for 8-inch wafers, UMC
plans to reduce the company's monthly 8-inch wafer capacity from
240,000 units to 160,000 units within the next six to eight months,
said Tsao.</P>
      <P>The company is planning to sell one-third of its 8-inch wafer
production facilities and use the capital to expand its 12-inch
production capacity, he added.</P>
      <P>Tsao disclosed that UMC's NT$1.5 billion capital investment this
year will be used to expand the production capacity of 12-inch
wafers.</P>
      <P>UMC now has three 12-inch fabs. Trecenti fab in Japan has monthly
production capacity of 1,000 wafers; Fab 12A in Tainan, Taiwan, has a
design capacity of 40,000 wafers and its production capacity by the
end of this year will reach 10,000 wafers; and the Singapore UMCi fab
will install its production equipment by the third quarter of 2002,
according to Vice Chairman and CEO Peter Chang.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the production costs of the 12-inch wafers will
be reduced by up to 30 percent as compared to that of 8-inch wafers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN INSPECTS NANTOU COUNTY IN WAKE OF TYPHOON TORAJI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Wednesday
inspected Nantou County, the area in Taiwan worst hit by Typhoon
Toraji, in the aftermath of the typhoon that swept across the island
Monday.</P>
      <P>The streets of Chunkeng Village in Shuili Township, Nantou
County, were literally buried by mudslides, and teary-eyed residents
of the village asked the president to help them rebuild their homes.</P>
      <P>The president said he had already instructed that an
inter-government agency task force be formed to formulate an overall
reconstruction plan.</P>
      <P>In response to complaints that the military has not been doing
enough in terms of relief and reconstruction work, Chen also
instructed the Ministry of National Defense to send more personnel to
join in the effort.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Nantou County Magistrate Peng Pai-hsien also said that
he had asked for more military personnel to help in clearing roads
and highways to bring traffic back to normal.</P>
      <P>Nantou County was the worst-hit county in Taiwan, with 25
residents being killed and 87 going missing, followed by Hualien
County with 24 residents killed and 29 missing. As most of the those
who went missing are believed to either have been swept away by
floods or buried in landslides or mudflows triggered by torrential
rains, the chances of finding them alive is considered slim.</P>
      <P>While the president headed to Nantou County, Vice President
Annette Lu inspected Hualien County Wednesday morning. Both the
president and vice president have donated one-month's salary towards
typhoon relief.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung has urged the Legislative
Yuan to agree to the use of special funds to help in reconstruction
efforts.</P>
      <P>A Buddhist organization took the lead in extending help by
donating NT$1 million (US$28,719) to the Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>Lin Chao, director general of Taiwan Sokagakkai, said that since
the disastrous earthquake of Sept. 21, 1999, the organization has
carried out spiritual reconstruction work in the quake-affected
areas, and he urged the public not to give up hope in the wake of
this new natural disaster.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Chang Po-ya, in accepting the check, noted that
Typhoon Toraji wreaked severe havoc and that the situation in some
areas is even worse than it was in the wake of the killer temblor of
Sept. 21, 1991.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang and another government agency chief donated
one-day's salary toward typhoon relief, and both urged other civil
servants to follow suit.</P>
      <P>In addition to the heavy human casualties, agriculture,
livestock, and fishery losses caused by the typhoon have been
estimated to be NT$1.58 billion.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Power Company said that as of 11 a.m. Wednesday, 15,575
households were still without electricity, adding that power should
be restored to most by Wednesday night.</P>
      <P>Some 2,000 of the worst hit households, located in the townships
of Shuili and Hsinyi in Nantou County, will have to wait for roads to
be cleared before work can commence on restoring their power.</P>

      <P>The number of foreign visitors to Taiwan in
the first six months of this year totaled 1.38 million, the
Cabinet-level Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS statistics show that of this figure, 520,000 people
came from Japan, 201,000 came from Hong Kong and 184,000 came from
the United States.</P>
      <P>Among the foreign visitors, 516,000 were tourists, up 38.5
percent over the same period of last year, while 452,000 came to
Taiwan for business, down 0.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Because of the increase in the number of foreign visitors, the
DGBAS said that the occupancy rate of international tourist hotels in
Taiwan averaged 63.6 percent between January-May, up 3.3 percent over
the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>The statistics also indicate that 3.74 million Taiwan people

      <P>Grenada, one of the Republic of

condolences and concern to Taiwan for the country's huge losses and
damage caused by Typhoon Toraji.</P>
      <P>In a letter delivered to ROC Ambassador L.S. Chiang, Grenada
Governor-General Sir Daniel Williams asked Chiang to pass on a letter
to ROC President Chen Shui-bian to express his deepest condolences
and grave concern over the havoc wrecked by the typhoon, Chiang said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Williams said it is regrettable that Taiwan was hit by the
disaster at a time when the country was working at reconstruction
following the Sept. 21 earthquake of 1999, the worst tremor to hit
Taiwan in a century.</P>
      <P>The Grenada government and people would like to extend their
moral support and best wishes to the people of Taiwan at a time when
they are suffering a great deal of pain, Chiang quoted Williams as
saying.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Toraji, which will go down in history as one of the
island's most damaging storms, swept through eastern and southern
Taiwan Monday, killing at least 72 people and leaving more than 134
still missing. The death toll is expected to climb higher as rescue
workers continue to find the bodies of those missing and now believed

      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou met Wednesday with
Echo Tsai, CEO of HiQ Computers in Sunnyvale, Calif. who has been
working since 1998 on a "Technology Goes Home" project to help
disadvantaged students learn how to use computers.</P>
      <P>Tsai grew up in the eastern Taiwan city of Taitung before going
to the United States and founding HiQ Computers in 1986, whose annual
transactions hit US$80 million last year.</P>
      <P>She started the "Technology Goes Home" project in Boston,
providing computer lessons for the city's poor students and helping
them gain basic computer skills. Those who finish all the courses
receive a computer as a gift and so far 1,000 computers have been
given out.</P>
      <P>The project has been very successful and has won the support of
both the mayor of Boston and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore. The
city has even designated June 14 as "Echo Tsai Day" as a mark of
respect for her contributions.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, computers are the easiest way to shorten the

    <HEADLINE>U.S. THINK TANK FORESEES NO BREAKTHROUGH IN CROSS-STRAIT LIMBO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York, July 31 (CNA)
(By Jennifer Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The lingering political stalemate between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is not expected to see any major
breakthrough this year, according to a report released Tuesday by a
noted U.S. think tank.</P>
      <P>The report prepared by the National Committee on American Foreign
Policy, many of whose research fellows have offered counseling to the
U.S. government, said mainland China will continue for the
foreseeable future to pressure Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian to accept its "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>The report said that as Chen's administration fails to control a
majority in the legislature, it has met opposition at nearly every
turn in carrying out its major policies.</P>
      <P>Against this background, the report said, mainland China will
shun any engagement with the Chen administration to avoid giving any
credit to Chen's personal political clout.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the report went on, mainland China will step up efforts
to forge ties with Taiwan's opposition camp and businesspeople with a
view to further weakening Chen's political clout and reputation.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the mainland authorities think Taiwan's
current political and economic doldrums are creating a favorable
environment for their "united front tricks."</P>
      <P>The report said Beijing seems to be waiting for the reshuffle of
Taiwan's political map that will follow the island's year-end
legislative elections and the 2004 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The report pointed out that the number of Taiwan-targeting
missiles deployed by mainland China has continued to increase, rising
from 40-50 five years ago to 300 at present. Moreover, it said, the
performance and accuracy of mainland China's newly deployed missiles
are better than the old ones.</P>
      <P>Even though mainland China has heightened its military threat to
Taiwan, the report said, Beijing is unlikely to use force against
Taiwan in the short term due to the following four reasons:</P>
      <P>-- Mainland China must focus its energy on domestic economic
modernization and partial political restructuring;</P>
      <P>-- the mainland hopes to forge good ties with the current U.S.
administration, to be admitted to the World Trade Organization as
early as possible and to smoothly host the 2008 Olympic Games;</P>
      <P>-- the mainland is seeking to forge better ties with its Asian
neighbors with a view to offsetting the expansion of U.S. influence
in the Asia-Pacific area. If Beijing attacks Taiwan at the moment,
the report said, it will draw a backlash from its Asian neighbors;
and</P>
      <P>-- the mainland leaders believe that time is on their side, that
Taiwan's politics will remain unstable due to wrangling between its
ruling and opposition parties and that the island will become
increasingly reliant on the mainland market along with growing
cross-strait commercial exchanges and Taipei's and Beijing's WTO
accession.</P>
      <P>Another noteworthy development is that the balance of military
power between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will eventually tilt
toward the mainland, no matter what kinds of advanced weapons the
United States sells to Taiwan in the future, the report said.</P>
      <P>As a result, the report continued, the mainland is expected to
continue its "wait and see" strategy toward cross-strait relations.
It will continue to watch whether Chen will compromise on the "one
China" issue, the report said, adding that the mainland at the same
time will avoid any unnecessary conflict with the United States.</P>
      <P>The report suggested that the Bush administration should exercise
prudence in dealing with cross-strait affairs. It said the best
strategy for the United States is to continue its present efforts to
cultivate a favorable atmosphere for the resumption of peaceful
cross-strait dialogue, including selling Taiwan selected advanced
weapons to help maintain the cross-strait balance of military power.</P>
      <P>The think tank is also scheduled to organize a roundtable meeting
in New York from Aug. 13-14. Scholars from Taiwan, mainland China and
the United States, as well as U.S. officials in charge of China and
Taiwan affairs, will attend the conference.</P>
      <P>It will be the first meeting of its kind since U.S. President
George W. Bush's inauguration early this year.</P>
      <P>The Taipei delegation will be composed of representatives of
Taiwan's three main political parties and several officials,
including Antonio Chiang, deputy secretary-general of the National
Security Council.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA VOWS TO PUSH FOR PRESIDENT CHEN'S VISIT TO DENMARK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Wednesday it will continue its efforts to pave the way for President
Chen Shui-bian to visit Denmark late this year to receive an award to
be presented by an international alliance of liberal parties.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokeswoman Chang Siao-yue said the Republic of China
government appreciates the Liberal International's goodwill in
deciding to present its 2001 Freedom Award to President Chen.</P>
      <P>As the award marks an international recognition of Chen's
contribution to promoting Taiwan's democratization, Chang said, the
MOFA hopes that Chen can receive the prestigious award in person.</P>
      <P>Chang said she cannot elaborate on relevant preparations for
Chen's travel to Denmark at the moment. Despite the absence of
formal diplomatic ties, the ROC and Denmark share common
beliefs in freedom and democracy, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Noting that boosting substantive ties with European countries
has been one of MOFA's major work plans, Chang said the ministry
will redouble its efforts to push for the realization of Chen's
Denmark travel plan to receive the Freedom Award. Because of
Beijing's diplomatic embargo against Taiwan, no ROC head of state has
ever visited any European country so far.</P>
      <P>Chang's remarks came after local news media reported that Chen's
personal aides have held many rounds of discussion on his
Denmark travel plan.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, Presidential Office officials said
whether Chen can visit Denmark to receive the award personally will
hinge on the Danish government's attitude.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the officials said, Chen has not yet filed a visa
application. "We'll decide whether to apply for a Danish visa based
on the developments in the general international situation in the
coming months as well as on the Danish government's attitude,"
said a presidential aide.</P>
      <P>If Denmark denies Chen's visa application, the aide said, the
chairman of the Liberal International may travel to Taiwan to present
the award to Chen.</P>
      <P>The London-based Liberal International (LI) groups liberal
parties in major countries around the world. Taiwan's current ruling
Democratic Progressive Party has been its member.</P>
      <P>The alliance decided at its executive commission meeting in
February to present its 2001 Freedom Award to President Chen. The
award is scheduled to be presented at the organization's annual
congress to be held in Denmark Nov. 9-10.</P>
      <P>In an interview with a Danish newspaper in March, Chen expressed
his hope that the Danish government can grant him a visa so that he
can receive the award at the LI's annual conference as the award
marks a recognition of the 23 million Taiwan people's pursuit of
freedom and democracy.</P>

record-breakers is Lo Tseng-wen, who has five children serving as
police officers, and the other is Chang A-piao, a centenarian who is
living with four generations of offspring under the same roof.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "By banishing all flatterers and
keeping away from the society of women; holding in low estimation
possession of worldly goods, but valuing moral qualities in men: that
is how the ruler gives encouragement to worthy men."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER CALLS FOR HALT TO EXCESSIVE DEVELOPMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung on Thursday called
for an across-the-board halt to excessive development around the
island as a means of preventing aggravating the effects of natural
disasters.</P>
      <P>Noting that floods and mudslides have become major killers in
Taiwan, Chang said residents in mountainous and riverside areas are
now so frightened that they dread the coming of rain.</P>
      <P>Chang said that unrelenting and excessive development, which is
taking Mother Nature and wildlife conservation hostage, must be
stopped.</P>
      <P>He urged all his compatriots and all the different levels of
government in Taiwan to learn a lesson from Typhoon Toraji, which
wreaked havoc across central and eastern Taiwan between Sunday and
Monday, by respecting nature when seeking economic gain.</P>
      <P>Chang said the central government will solicit ideas and plans to
help Taiwan achieve sustainable development that is not at the cost
of the natural environment.</P>
      <P>The premier made the call during a meeting sponsored by the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture on Taiwan's agricultural
development amidst the island's bid to join the World Trade
Organization.</P>
      <P>Toraji, one of the deadliest typhoons to strike the island in
recent memory, killed 75 people, injured 36 and left 133 others
unaccounted for. The death toll is expected to climb as rescue
workers continue to find the bodies of those missing and now believed
dead.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An elderly woman has combed the banks of
typhoon-ravaged Fatsuchi Brook in Taichung County over the last two
days trying to find her grandson who is believed to have been washed
away by floods wrought by Typhoon Toraji earlier this week.</P>
      <P>"Have you seen my grandson?" the 81-year-old grandmother of
Taichung County resident Liao Chen-cheng asked of every person who
appeared along the banks of the brook.</P>
      <P>She also checked every body that was unearthed from the mud along
the brook, which is now dry only three days after the typhoon swept
across the island on Sunday and Monday, causing severe flooding,
landslides and mudslides along rivers in eastern and central Taiwan,
claiming 75 lives and leaving 133 others unaccounted for.</P>
      <P>Between checking bodies that were unearthed and asking passersby
about her grandson, the elderly woman sat on a rock on the banks of
the brook and waited.</P>
      <P>Liao was believed to have been washed away by floods Monday
afternoon when he was trying to rush home by taking a short cut by
riding his motorcycle along Fatsuchi Brook, which was dry prior to
being inundated with surging water caused by heavy rains brought by
the typhoon. His backpack was discovered later in the day on the
banks of the brook.</P>
      <P>In Hualien, eastern Taiwan, one of the two counties hardest hit
by Typhoon Toraji, Chiang Chi-meng, the only survivor of a six-member
family, didn't know what to say Wednesday when a body initially
identified by rescue workers as his seven-year-old eldest daughter
was found to be someone else.</P>
      <P>While carrying the dead child's body in his arms and crying, he
was told that it was in fact not his daughter but the six-year-old
daughter from another family. The body, identified by the style and
length of hair, was later retrieved by surviving members of the Chiu
family.</P>
      <P>Chiang, recalling the events of Monday night after Typhoon Toraji
pounded Hualien County, said that the river's water level rose
abruptly, whereupon he instructed all of his family members to climb
onto the tin roof of their two-story home. Before he knew it, he said
they were all swept away, including his elderly parents, wife and two
daughters, despite his clutching onto his parents and his wife
clutching onto the two children.</P>
      <P>He said he later awoke and found himself stuck on a thick tree
trunk lying in the river. He saw no trace of any of his family
members, so he waited by the river and watched rescue workers comb
the mud and rocks. As of Tuesday afternoon, none of his family
members had been accounted for.</P>
      <P>In Hsinyi Township in the central county of Nantou, the other of
Taiwan's two hardest hit counties, an aboriginal man surnamed Liao
walked for an entire day and night to reach his home in the
mountainous village of Pishih to find his daughter.</P>
      <P>Reaching Pishih after 34 hours of walking and climbing, Liao
discovered that the entire village had been buried by landslides and
falling rocks.</P>
      <P>Liao said he reckons that more than 30 residents in some 20
households in the village went missing in the disaster, including his
teenaged daughter, who was home alone when the typhoon struck.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA CONCERNED ABOUT CRASH IN BRAZIL OF BUS CARRYING ROC TOURISTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Thursday that the Republic of China representative office in Brazil
has sent staff members to help handle the aftermath of the crash near
Rio de Janeiro of a tourist bus carrying 41 ROC expatriates.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokeswoman Chang Siao-yue said Huang Lien-sheng, chief of
the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Rio de Janeiro, rushed to
the crash site upon learning of the traffic mishap, in which five ROC
expatriates were killed and 17 others injured.</P>
      <P>Chang said the MOFA has formed a special task force to help deal
with relevant affairs.</P>
      <P>Among those killed was Chen Lung-hsing, president of the
Taiwanese Association in Sao Paulo, Chang said, adding that the other
four people who died were all ROC expatriates residing in the United
States, including Tsai Chao-chia, Lee Yung-yi, Huang Hsiu-o and Cheng
Yun-ju, president of the Taiwanese Women's Association in North
America.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that all of the injured have been sent to four
nearby hospitals for emergency treatment. Five sustained serious but
not life-threatening injuries, while the rest received only mild
injuries in the accident, Chang said, quoting reports from Brazil.</P>
      <P>All of the passengers aboard the ill-fated tour bus were
participants in the 28th annual conference of the World Taiwanese
Association (WTA) held in Sao Paulo July 28-29, Chang said.</P>
      <P>More than 700 WTA members from North America, Latin America,
Europe, Japan, Australia and Taiwan attended the two-day conference.
After the meeting, the participants were divided into three groups to
partake in sightseeing trips to Rio de Janeiro, Iguazu and the Amazon
region, respectively.</P>
      <P>Most of the 100-plus WTA members who joined the Rio de Janeiro
tour group came from the United States. They took three separate
buses. The accident only affected those aboard the ill-fated bus. No
ROC diplomats stationed in Brazil accompanied the group on the
sightseeing trip.</P>
      <P>According to reports from Brazil, the accident occurred when the
tour bus was returning from the historic city of Petropolis, located
about 50 kilometers north of Rio de Janeiro.</P>
      <P>Brazilian police authorities were quoted as having said that the
bus driver seemed to be speeding as he was turning a sharp curve. The
driver lost control of the bus which then overturned and plunged from
the upper deck to the lower deck of the highway.</P>
      <P>The highway was closed for several hours to facilitate relief
operations.</P>
      <P>Some Taiwan residents in the Rio de Janeiro area came to the
hospitals where the injured WTA members are recuperating to offer
necessary assistance.</P>
      <P>The organizing committee of the 28th WTA conference commissioned
one of the largest Brazilian travel agencies to arrange the
post-meeting pleasure tour. The Brazilian travel agency reportedly
purchased travel safety insurance policies for all tour group
members.</P>
      <P>The organizing committee had invited several ROC officials,
including Chen Chu, chairwoman of the Council of Labor affairs, Tchen
Yu-chiou, chairwoman of the Council of Cultural Affairs, and Yao
Chia-wen, a senior adviser to the President, to attend the annual WTA
congress.</P>
      <P>None of them however managed to attend the meeting due to visa
problems. The ROC does not maintain formal diplomatic ties with
Brazil. About 20 WTA members, most of them pro-independence
activists, traveled from Taiwan to Brazil to take part in the
conference.</P>

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung donated one month
of his salary toward typhoon relief Thursday and called for other
civil servants around the country to follow suit.</P>
      <P>Noting that it will take huge amounts of money to recover from
the destruction of the typhoon, Chang said the Executive Yuan
initiated a "one-day's salary donation campaign" Wednesday in the
hope that more money will be collected shortly to expedite relief
work in affected areas in the wake of Typhoon Toraji, which ravaged
the island July 29-30.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Executive Yuan officials said that people who intend
to contribute cash to help accelerate relief work are welcome to send
in money to the Ministry of the Interior (MOI), at postal account
number 19595889.</P>
      <P>MOI officials reported that as of noon Thursday, members of the
generous Taiwan public have sent in nearly NT$20 million (US$576,370)
over the past two days through the MOI postal account and two other
bank accounts each offered by the Central Bank of China and the
International Commercial Bank of China.</P>
      <P>In related news, a Kuomintang sub-group at the Legislative Yuan
on Thursday initiated a donation drive labeled as "casting a brick to
attract jade," to collect donations from all sectors in Taiwan and
overseas Chinese communities abroad.</P>
      <P>To serve as the "brick," KMT Legislator Chen Hung-chi and Hu
Yi-shou, chairman of the Taipei Chenghuang (town god) Temple, who is
co-sponsoring the campaign with the KMT lawmakers, each donated
NT$200,000 (US$5,764) in cash to facilitate the relief drive.</P>
      <P>On the first day of the drive, a local dairy company promised to
deliver 60,000 Tetra bags of milk worth approximately NT$700,000
(US$20,173) to Tahsin village in Kuangfu township in the eastern
county of Hualien, one of the areas hardest-hit by Typhoon Toraji,
which has claimed 75 lives, left 133 missing and 36 seriously injured
as of Thursday.</P>
      <P>Another Taipei household electrical appliances company offered to
send 50 washing machines to Tahsin village Friday to show their

      <P>The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission
(OCAC) expressed condolences Thursday for the death of the only son
of one of its U.S.-based advisers.</P>
      <P>OCAC officials said they feel deep regret over the murder in
Orange County, California Monday of Kenneth Chiu, son of Christopher
Chiu, an OCAC adviser.</P>
      <P>The officials said Christopher Chiu is an unpaid OCAC adviser,
not an OCAC commissioner as previously reported.</P>
      <P>As the tragic incident was basically a private family affair, the
officials said the OCAC was not in a position to make any further
comment.</P>
      <P>According to a Los Angeles Times report, Kenneth Chiu, 17, was
allegedly stabbed to death by his next-door neighbor, 20-year-old
Christopher Charles Hearn.</P>
      <P>Hearn was later taken to a local jail on suspicion of murder and
a large knife was recovered at his residence. Hearn, "a violent
person" according to his neighbor, was questioned through sign
language because he is deaf and unable to speak.</P>
      <P>U.S. prosecutors alleged that Hearn waited for Kenneth to return
home, and then attacked him with the large knife that was found with
Hearn.</P>
      <P>Hearn, held without bail, faces special-circumstance charges of
lying-in-waiting and murder based on ethnicity, either of which would

    <HEADLINE>OLYMPIC SPONSORS URGED TO PRESS CHINA TO LIFT INTERNET CONTROLS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  1 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Human Rights Watch on Wednesday called
on media and computer giants underwriting the 2008 Olympic Games as
well as other Internet companies doing business in mainland China to
work toward persuading the Chinese government to lift its restrictive
regulations governing Internet use.</P>
      <P>Sidney Jones, the Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said these
tightening government controls "are having a chilling effect on
academic freedom, commercial exchanges and ordinary communications."</P>
      <P>"This is one area where human rights and corporate interests
should coincide," he said, adding that "more people will use Internet
services and related technologies if they don't have to worry about
getting arrested."</P>
      <P>In a report released Wednesday, titled "Freedom of Expression and
the Internet in China," the New York-based human rights organization
pointed out that Communist Chinese authorities have issued more than
60 sets of regulations governing Internet content since Beijing began
permitting commercial Internet accounts in 1995.</P>
      <P>The report details many of these regulations, describes recent
Communist Chinese efforts to police Internet cafes, and summarizes
the cases of several people put on trial or sentenced to prison terms
for downloading or posting politically sensitive material on the Web.</P>
      <P>It pointed out that as recently as July 11, mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin condemned the spread of "pernicious
information" on the Internet and called existing legislation
"inadequate."</P>
      <P>"As the Olympic momentum builds, Chinese websites are going to
proliferate," said Jones, noting that "corporate sponsors are going
to have to choose between helping China open up by getting these
controls removed or abetting repression by giving the government the
technology for Internet censorship."</P>
      <P>"China's entry into the World Trade Organization should also give
companies an incentive to press to have these restrictions lifted,"
he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. OFFICIAL REAFFIRMS SUPPORT FOR ROC'S WHO BID: HEALTH MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  2  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Deputy Secretary of Health and Human
Services Claude Allen says that the United States supports the
Republic of China's participation in the activities of the World
Health Organization (WHO), Taiwan's Minister of Health, Lee
Ming-liang, said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lee, who is currently in the U.S. to solicit support for the
ROC's WHO bid, made the remarks in a telephone interview with
reporters in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee said that during his visit to Washington, D.C. last week he
had met with Allen, several influential members of congress and
officials of the American Institute in Taiwan, a quasi-official
organization authorized to handle ROC-U.S. relations in the absence
of diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>During their talks, Lee said Allen had told him that the U.S.
government supports Taiwan's bid to participate in WHO activities.
According to Allen, Lee said, U.S. President George W. Bush would
also take pleasure in seeing Taiwan's participation in WHO
activities.</P>
      <P>However, Lee said, Allen did not directly refer to the term
"observer status" in relation to Taiwan's participation in the WHO.</P>
      <P>Lee further said many U.S. senators and congressmen had also
voiced firm support for the ROC's WHO bid. "They assured me that they
would introduce resolutions again demanding the U.S. executive branch
take concrete steps to back Taiwan's WHO bid," he said.</P>
      <P>Lee also met with Allen Jones, secretary-general of the World
Federation of Public Health Associations and gave interviews to the
Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times.</P>
      <P>Both the Times and the Post have shown sympathy for Taiwan's
stance in their coverage of the issue.</P>
      <P>In an article appearing in its Aug. 1 issue, titled "Taiwan's
lonely quest for help on health," the Post said the International
Committee of the Red Cross, Rotary International, the Vatican, the

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S 2001 ECONOMIC GROWTH TO BE BELOW 2 PERCENT: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 2 (CNA)
(By Flor  Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economic growth rate for the whole
of 2001 will fall below 2 percent, despite an optimistic outlook that
business conditions will recover by the end of this year, an official
with the Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>W. A. Yeh, an advisory member of a DGBAS committee and a former
vice chairman of the Council of Economic Planning and Development,
Taiwan's highest government agency in charge of drawing up the
country's economic policies, said the low growth forecast is due to
the fact that Taiwan's economy grew by only 1 percent in the second
quarter and it will be hard to surpass 4 percent for the fourth
quarter.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS committee is slated to call a meeting Aug. 17 to
officially adjust downward Taiwan's economic growth rate for the
whole of 2001 from 4.20 percent forecast previously.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's leading index for June rebounded, Yeh said it
was only an initial good sign following a continued contraction over
the past year. The leading index must rebound for three months in a
row to indicate whether a country's economy has effectively regained
momentum, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, it would be over optimistic to expect that
Taiwan's export-oriented economy will be able to revive in the fourth
quarter, despite the fact that the U. S. economy is very likely to
rebound during the same time, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RESUMING DIALOGUE KEY TO CROSS-STRAIT TIES: KMT CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Reopening channels for dialogue between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait is crucial to the development of
cross-strait relations, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The two sides must renew their dialogue channels under the 1992
'one China, separate definitions' consensus to ensure that
cross-strait relations move in a peaceful direction," Lien said while
meeting with a delegation of former U.S. government officials.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lien told his guests that the KMT would never
accept Beijing's claim that Taiwan is part of the People's Republic
of China.</P>
      <P>Touching on the possible U.S. role in cross-strait relations,
Lien said he doesn't think that the United States needs to play the
role of an "active promoter."</P>
      <P>In his view, Lien said, cross-strait issues should be resolved by
the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lien further said Taiwan does not oppose U.S.-mainland China
engagements and would never create any incident that may harm
Washington-Beijing ties.</P>
      <P>"Likewise, we hope that Taiwan-U.S. relations would never be
affected by U.S.-mainalnd China interactions," Lien said, adding that
the United States should forge a balanced, parallel triangular
Taipei-Washington-Beijing relationship to maintain peace and security
in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Turning to the domestic front, Lien said an intraparty split led
to the KMT's embarrassing defeat in the 2000 presidential election.
Nevertheless, Lien said, the KMT has no intention to ask members of
its splinter groups to return to the party.</P>
      <P>"We only hope to cooperate with them because the KMT and its
splinter groups share common political concepts, goals and values,"
he noted.</P>
      <P>Asked by some former Clinton administration officials whether he
would visit mainland China, Lien said he does not reject such a
proposal. "But I don't have any mainland travel plan at the moment,"
he said.</P>
      <P>Lien said Taiwan's current woes result not only from economic
problems but also from political instability.</P>
      <P>Lien claimed that the current Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP)-led government's failure to respect the ROC's "dual leadership"
constitutional system has led to a constitutional crisis.</P>
      <P>"While the KMT controls a majority in the legislature, it does
not have a say in Cabinet formation and policy formulation. This is
the root cause of political instability and uncertainty here," he
said.</P>
      <P>Lien said the KMT is now carrying out sweeping intraparty
restructuring with a view to reinventing itself and to regaining
power by doing well in the legislative elections scheduled for
December and the next presidential election in 2004.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAYOR MA PITCHES FOR SUNGSHAN AIRPORT'S ROLE IN CROSS-STRAIT AIR LINKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday the
government should not rule out the possibility that Taipei's
Sungshan Airport is used as a supplementary facility for
direct flights services across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Ma said the city government's Bureau of Transportation has
finalized a feasibility study which concludes that Sungshan Airport
is fully equipped to operate direct cross-strait flight
services.</P>
      <P>Ma said although the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)
under the Ministry of Transportation and communication claimed that
Sungshan Airport has reached its capacity in handling domestic
flight services, the market situation would be different after the
island's high-speed railway is inaugurated four to five years later.</P>
      <P>"By then, the demand for domestic flight services would decline
by an estimated 22 percent after the high-speed railway opens to
traffic," Ma said, adding that Sungshan Airport would then have
capacity to operate direct cross-strait flights.</P>
      <P>Ma pointed out that Taipei residents account for 30 percent of
cross-strait air traffic volume. If Sungshan Airport is allowed to
operate direct cross-strait flights, he said, Taipei residents would
no longer need to travel to Chiang Kai-shek International Airport
in Taoyuan County, some 40 kilometers south of Taipei.</P>
      <P>According to the city government's study, the best timing for
opening direct cross-strait air links is around 2007 or 2008. Ma
said he is convinced that direct cross-strait air traffic volume
will be very large. "And we would need many airports to operate such
flight services. Therefore, CAA officials should not rule out
Sungshan Airport from the list of possible supplementary airports
for direct cross-strait flights," he added.</P>

(By Chang Hui-yen and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chang Fu-mei, minister of the Overseas
Chinese Affairs Commission (OCAC), urged overseas Chinese in Dallas,
Texas to help Taiwan's bid to participate in activities of the World
Health Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks when she met with overseas Chinese
Wednesday. Edward Feng, director of Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in Houston, also took part in the meeting.</P>
      <P>Chang said that U.S. officials had expressed support for Taiwan's
participation in the WHO, and she asked the overseas Chinese to make
use of their relations with U.S. congressmen to promote Taiwan's
acceptance by the WHO.</P>
      <P>She also said that it would be best to become a full member of
the WHO, but that being granted observer status would be a good step
in the right direction.</P>
      <P>Feng also said that the governor of Texas and Texas senators and
congressmen are good friends of U.S. President George W. Bush, and
they have the potential to become part of Bush's team. He has
therefore asked the overseas Chinese to help invite the rising
political stars to visit Taiwan to witness its democracy, freedom and
economic prosperity.</P>
      <P>Given budget constraints, Chang also said that the future focus
of the commission will be to put time, energy and money into
Southeast Asia and central and south America where the overseas
Chinese are not as well off as those in the United States.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that the commission plans to communicate with and
serve overseas Chinese groups, promote Chinese culture and Mandarin
education, promote trade for Taiwan businessmen and enhance services
to overseas Chinese students.</P>
      <P>Chang has been traveling to meet with overseas Chinese since she
took office last year. She left Taiwan July 18 for a visit to Europe
before flying to Atlanta, Georgia, and later to Dallas.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 2 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Local economists and scholars on a symposium
Thursday were divided on whether the government should adopt a tax
cut to stimulate the sagging economy.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica member Yu Tzong-shian said a tax cut would not
stimulate the economy at a time when the government is mired in
financial woes, while Mai Chao-cheng, another Academia Sinica member,
said the government should reduce its intervention in the market or
keep out of the market completely.</P>
      <P>The symposium were jointly sponsored by several business leaders
who were invited to serve as members of the Presidential Economic
Development Advisory Conference (EDAC).</P>
      <P>Yeh Wan-an, an advisor at the Chung-Hua Institute for Economic
Research, pointed out that there can be no economic development
without a sound financial system. He suggested that now is not an
appropriate time to consider tax cuts as a way to spur the economy.</P>
      <P>National Chengchi University Professor Chang Chang-chi said that
continued capital outflow from Taiwan will do no good to the
country's economic development and suggested that the government
establish clear industrial policies and focus on the information and
related industries.</P>
      <P>Chang added that the nation's labor policies should be adjusted
and suggested that the government consider enacting legislation on
unemployment insurance.</P>
      <P>However, National Taiwan University Professor Liu Yi-ju said she
is in favor of the scrapping of a 10 percent tax on corporations'
surplus, adding that this would stimulate enterprises to retain their
capital in order to expand their investments.</P>
      <P>Liu added that every tax cut must be accompanied by supporting
measures and suggested that the government also eliminate the stock
transaction tax while reinstating the stock gain tax.</P>
      <P>Liu Tai-ying, chairman of the China Development Industrial Bank,
suggested that the government increase its debts to 48 percent of the
gross national product in order to raise capital</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's leading computer firm, Acer Inc.,
has split its own brand name division and research and service units
in an effort to create greater efficiency and profits for the
business concern, an Acer executive said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Acer Manager C.T. Wang said that the company divided its brand
name operation unit -- ABO -- and its research and service division
-- DMS -- in July in a move to draw a clear line between the two
business departments.</P>
      <P>From now on, the ABO division, which is now an Acer-affiliated
group, will focus on a diversified outsourcing production of desktop
home computers, including competing against other outsourcers to make
Acer's own computers, while its DMS department will be retained
within Acer Inc. to dedicate its energy to running own brand
products, according to Wang.</P>
      <P>Wang also said that Acer has set up R&amp;D centers in Beijing and
Italy and added that the company's head office in Taipei will
dispatch a group of experts to Beijing to help carry out outsourcing
tasks there.</P>
      <P>He added that the Acer parent company hopes to lift the number of
outsourced computer units in Beijing to more than 12,000 in the near
future, while it is using its distribution network to expand Acer's
presence in European markets by commissioning outsourcers from Taiwan
to manufacture its brand name computers.</P>

      <P>The Chinese manager of Japan's Daiei Hawks
baseball team was awarded a medal by the Republic of China government
Thursday for his contributions to the development of Taiwan baseball
and the promotion of sports exchanges between Taiwan and Japan.</P>
      <P>He received the Order of Brilliant Star with Grand Cordon from Lo
Fu-chuan, representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Representative Office in Tokyo.</P>
      <P>Known in Japan as Sadaharu Oh, Wang broke the world record of 756
home runs when he was a slugger for the Yomiuri Giants in 1977. He
retired in 1980 after extending the record to 868.</P>
      <P>After his retirement, he served as their manager before joining
the Hawks several years ago. The Hawks have been the champions of the
Pacific League for the past two consecutive seasons.</P>
      <P>At the medal-presentation ceremony held at the ROC Mission in
Tokyo, Lo lauded Wang for his career achievements, including
rewriting the world's home-run record and being awarded the first
"National Honor Award" by the Japanese government in 1977.</P>

40 years and added that the most important thing as a manager is to
"let team members share the joy of victory."</P>

in a win or a loss, "everyone must do his best."</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  2  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States has not received a
visa application from Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian to
enter the country to make a speech at the National Press Club, White
House National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Rice made the remarks in an interview with the Washington Times.
She did not say what the U.S. response would be should such an
application be received.</P>
      <P>National Press Club Chairman Richard A. Ryan extended an
invitation to Chen June 17 for a visit to the United States to
deliver a luncheon speech there in September or October. Chen
responded last week that he would be delighted to accept the
invitation and asked to have further communication on the matter.</P>
      <P>Chen's desire to visit the United States has become a thorny
issue for the administration of U.S. President George Bush. Rice said
at a press conference in June that Chen's transit stops in New York
and Houston in May were courtesies accorded to an elected president
of a democratic country.</P>
      <P>Washington Times reporter Bill Gertz visited Taipei to interview
Chen earlier this year during which Chen urged the United States,
Japan and Taiwan to develop a missile defense system. Upon his
return, Gertz asked Secretary of State Colin Powell and Rice about
Chen's suggestion.</P>
      <P>Rice said that U.S. Aegis-equipped warships could provide a
shield against missile attack in Asia, but added that it is
"premature to decide whether such a system could be deployed in a
joint U.S.-Japan-Taiwan system as suggested by the ROC president."</P>
      <P>"A lot frankly depends on what the (mainland) Chinese do with
their missile capability across the Taiwan Strait," she said.</P>
      <P>Rice also said that the administration's strategy regarding
Beijing is to integrate mainland China's economy internationally with
the goal of eventually causing its political dictatorship to enact
reforms.</P>
      <P>She said that "everyone would agree that China is a rising power
in the Asia-Pacific and therefore we have a number of security issues
in conflict with the Chinese," including mainland China's resentment
of the U.S. presence in the region, differences over Taiwan and human
rights, and Beijing's weapons and missile sales.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) Vice Chairman Lee Kao-chao said Thursday that the
local currency is not expected to further depreciate against a weaker
U.S. dollar.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the local unit will not continue to slide, due to
the fact that other G8 member states have kept pressure on the United
States on the grounds that a strong greenback is not good for the
global financial situation. He predicted that the United States will
soon adjust its strong currency policy.</P>
      <P>CEPD Vice Secretary-General Thomas Ming-feng Yeh said the
European Union is very likely to use the opportunity to ask the
United States to allow its currency to depreciate, given the fact
that the Euro has lost more than 30 percent of its value against the
U.S. dollar since its inception two years ago.</P>
      <P>In Asia, weakened Asian currencies have not helped boost regional
countries' exports as a result of a sluggish world economy and a
slumping U.S. market, he added, noting that a strong U.S. dollar has
in turn had a negative effect in Asian countries' normal economic
activities and foreign trade.</P>
      <P>Yeh, however, pointed out that it remains to be seen whether the

the best guarantee of stability.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Chief of the General Staff Gen. Tang Yao-ming and

      <P>Without security, he said, there would be no stability. Without
stability, the people would not have felt safe to carry out various

      <P>In modern warfare, the importance of air defense is greater than
in the past, he continued, adding that whether missile forces can
bring their strength into play depends on equipment availability.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he instructed the officers and soldiers to operate and
maintain their equipment in accordance with regulations in order to
preserve an effective and high-availability air defense.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the nation is building up a basic military force
that is capable of meeting its self-defense needs and that Taiwan has
no intention of starting an arms race with mainland China or

assistance to his hard-hit county.</P>
      <P>Peng said at a press conference that some of the areas in the

21, 1999 earthquake, but rescue work is being hampered by road
disruption and limited manpower and resources.</P>
      <P>Peng took a helicopter to inspect affected areas of the central
county's Hsinyi Township, where he encountered criticism from
residents who said the rescuers came too late and the government did
not understand their plight.</P>
      <P>Peng said that he regretted that he did not have the authority to
command airplanes to go to some townships still cut off from the

Monday.</P>
      <P>He also questioned the central government's efforts in relief
work, saying that after the Sept. 21 quake, military personnel could
be seen everywhere helping the residents clear their land, and that
the military personnel could clear roads in one day, compared with
this time, when Shuili, Luku and Hsinyi townships are still closed to
traffic.</P>
      <P>Peng noted that 20,000 military personnel pitched in to the
relief work after the quake, but only 2,000 were sent this time and
even then, only after repeated requests.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the 9-21 Earthquake Post Disaster Recovery Commission
set up a command center for reconstruction work as a result of
Toraji, which Executive Director Huang Jung-chun said will form a

      <P>Huang added that in the first stage of the operation, the center

that the ROC Embassy can only await the court's verdict.</P>
      <P>According to Paraguayan media Wu Wen-huan is a leader of the
Fuching gang, a mainland Chinese criminal gang in Eastern City. He is
accused of using threats and blackmail against Taiwan businessmen in
the South American country.</P>
      <P>The overseas Chinese community is said to be angry but too afraid
of Wu to speak out, Yen went on, adding that the ROC government hopes
that the Paraguayan police will eliminate gangsters and let overseas
Chinese live peacefully in Paraguay.</P>
      <P>Yen further pointed out that Wu's alleged threats have also
affected Taiwan investor confidence, with "many" investors
being reluctant to invest in Paraguay even though the country
possesses good investment conditions.</P>
      <P>Yen also ruled out the possibility of a Taiwan-financed
industrial park being fully occupied within a year as local media
have reported, which he said is also due to Wu's threats.</P>
      <P>Wu was an adviser to the Foreign Relations Committee of the Lower
House of Paraguay, with a three-month tenure that ended June 30 this
year, an appointment the local media claimed was obtained through
cronyism.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US EXPERT URGES TAIWAN TO DIVERSIFY ENERGY SOURCES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 2 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An expert from the United States recommended
Thursday that Taiwan should diversify its energy sources, promote
energy efficiency and take part in international large-scale energy
research.</P>
      <P>Ernest Moniz, undersecretary of the Department of Energy under
the former Clinton administration, told a panel of science and
technology advisers under the Executive Yuan that Taiwan is right in
starting research into wind power, which has the potential to become
a source of supplemental power within ten years.</P>
      <P>Moniz also suggested studies in co-generation technology, which
uses heat energy produced in industrial processes to generate
electricity, and scattered small power generation stations.</P>
      <P>Energy efficiency is a challenge facing the whole world, Moniz
said while calling on the island to help heavy energy consumers such
as steel mills to find ways of boosting energy efficiency during the
manufacturing process and thereby boosting their competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Noting that nuclear energy is a cheap source of electricity that
does not produce any greenhouse gases, Moniz predicted that it will
remain a major source of energy in the next one or two decades.</P>
      <P>The U.S. energy expert said, however, that the permanent disposal
of nuclear waste is a thorny problem and noted that no new nuclear
plants are planned in the near future in the United States because of
this.</P>
      <P>He suggested that Taiwan should take part in international
geological studies to seek ideal places for nuclear waste dumping
sites.</P>
      <P>These studies are sure to bear heavily on the worldwide nuclear
power policy, Moniz added.</P>
      <P>Automobile fuel is another subject of study he urged Taiwan to
devoted itself to, saying that the government's automobile policy is
poorly conceived because it fails to prod automobile manufacturers to
use advanced technology to reduce the pollutants released by
automobiles.</P>
      <P>Moniz was invited to take part in a three-day energy conference
organized by the Science and Technology Advisory Group under the
Executive Yuan to help the government shape its energy policy.</P>
      <P>Co-convenor Tsay Ching-yen said at the wrapping up of the
conference Thursday that Moniz's suggestions will be translated into
specific policy in a meeting between various ministries and
government agencies next month.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The death toll from Typhoon Toraji, which
barreled across the island between Sunday and Monday, had risen to 83
by 9 p.m. Thursday, with another 130 people still unaccounted for,
according to government statistics.</P>
      <P>The heavy casualties make Toraji the 7th-most lethal typhoon
since 1958, the year in which Taiwan authorities began collecting
data on casualties caused by typhoons.</P>
      <P>According to the statistics compiled by the National Fire
Administration under the Ministry of the Interior, Typhoon Gloria in
1963 was the deadliest one, claiming 224 lives and leaving 88 people
missing, followed by Typhoon Pamela in 1961, which caused 158 deaths
and left 121 people missing.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Shirley in 1950 came in third place with 108 deaths and
81 people missing.</P>
      <P>From the fourth to the six places are: Typhoon Vera in 1977, with
104 deaths and 10 people missing; Typhoon Elsie in 1969, with 93
deaths and 12 people missing; and Typhoon Fran in 1970, with 89
deaths and 41 people missing.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Opal in 1962, with 79 deaths and one person missing and
Typhoon Flossie in 1968, which claimed 74 lives and left 31 people
missing, were ranked seventh and eighth respectively before being
overtaken by Toraji within only six hours on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the monetary cost of agricultural damage from Toraji
had risen to NT$6.16 billion (us$181.17 million), according to the
Council of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>Nantou and Hualien counties, the two counties that bore the brunt
of the havoc, suffered losses of NT$2.31 billion (US$68.05 million)
and NT$990 million, respectively, to crops and agricultural

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR CALLS FOR CLOSER EXCHANGES WITH M'LAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  August  2  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday
that while Taipei City will respect the views of the central
government concerning issues on cross-Taiwan Strait relations, it
cannot rely on the central government to decide "on everything."</P>
      <P>Ma, who has previously served as vice chairman of the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, said that cross-strait
exchanges are very close, noting that cross-strait trade totaled more
than US$30 billion last year, with Taiwan enjoying a trade surplus of
US$10 billion.</P>
      <P>In addition, he went on, a great number of 40,000 Taiwan
businesses investing in the mainland come from Taipei City. "I cannot
ignore the issue as the head of Taipei City Hall," Ma said, adding
that the Taipei city government must also have a clear attitude
toward cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the city cannot avoid such questions as "leaving
roots in Taiwan," or a primary school for the children of Taiwan
businessmen soon to open in Shanghai, or some mainland cities that
desire to have exchanges with Taipei City.</P>
      <P>Ma said that Taipei has to devise a policy that is the most
beneficial to its residents and cannot wait for the central
government to make the decisions.</P>
      <P>The popular mayor said that Taipei will basically follow the
regulations of the central government, but will also develop
strategies and approaches that "the central government cannot."</P>
      <P>Taipei's exchanges with other mainland cities, especially
Shanghai, have been brisk, said Ma, adding that the exchanges focus
on city administration, official and unofficial exchanges and
substantial exchanges in trade and culture.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, Ma said that judging from present situation,
whether or not both sides enter the World Trade Organization, Taiwan
will have to engage in dialogue with the mainland. He added
that a mechanism for the division of labor between Taiwan and the
mainland that leaves R&amp;D and high-technology in Taiwan would be most
beneficial for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma also called for the central government not to restrict itself
by banning local government heads from visiting the mainland and
asked the central government to be "bolder and more far-sighted" so
that cross-strait relations can be stabilized to a point acceptable
to both sides.</P>
      <P>He also expressed the hope that the ongoing Economic Development
Advisory Conference will study all these questions so as to make the
best use of Taiwan's advantages, otherwise, he warned, Taiwan could
have less and less leverage in dealing with cross-strait relations.</P>

anniversary of the end of the Second World War.</P>
      <P>The six Nobel laureates invited to Lu's Taiwan Alliance for
Global Peace are Betty Williams, Jody Williams, Joseph Rotblat, Lech
Walesa, Oscar Arias Sanchez and Frederik W. de Klerk.</P>
      <P>Betty Williams, an Irishwoman who won the Nobel Peace Prize in

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP)
Thursday nominated the party's deputy secretary-general, Chin
Chin-sheng, to run for the post of Taipei county magistrate in the
December county chief and legislative elections.</P>
      <P>After the nomination was announced, Chin and several PFP
legislative candidates began visiting supporters in the Hsinchuang
area, accompanied by PFP Vice Chairman Chang Chao-hsiung.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taipei County has been ruled by the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) for 12 years, Chin said that "it is time for
a change now."</P>
      <P>If elected, Chin said, he will place greater focus on the
improvement of the county's transportation system, environmental
protection and illegal buildings to bring them up to the level of
Taipei City.</P>
      <P>Upon learning of Chin's nomination, Kuomintang (KMT) candidate
Lin Chih-chia expressed the hope that the three main opposition
parties -- the KMT, the PFP and the New Party -- will cooperate to
support a single candidate so as to ensure victory in the election.</P>
      <P>He said that he would agree to have the candidate selected
through a public opinion survey.</P>
      <P>As incumbent magistrate Su Chen-chang of the DPP will seek
re-election in the election and Lin stated that Su's re-election will
be a foregone conclusion if the opposition camp fails to cooperate.</P>
      <P>He said that he would discuss the idea when he met with KMT
Chairman Lien Chan Friday, and added that he would also confer with
Chin and New Party leader Wang Chien-shien after his meeting with
Lien.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang did not exclude the possibility of running on the
New Party ticket, but stressed that he wants to promote the
cooperation of the opposition camp.</P>
      <P>"If the opposition parties do not want to cooperate," he said,
"their efforts will be in vain, and their budgets for the elections
should be given to the victims of Typhoon Toraji."</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKER URGES SHELVING ARMS PURCHASE AND USING MONEY FOR RELIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A lawmaker on Friday urged the Chen
administration to postpone a US$4 billion arms purchase from the
United States and use the money for reconstruction work in the
aftermath of Typhoon Toraji that swept across Taiwan July 29-30.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Legislator Kuo Jung-chen submitted the
emergency written appeal to the Executive Yuan Friday, asking that
the money saved by shelving the purchase be used to help residents in
areas battered by the typhoon recover from the disaster.</P>
      <P>As of late Thursday, 83 people were confirmed dead and another
130 people were still missing as a result of Typhoon Toraji, the
seventh most deadly typhoon to hit Taiwan in the last four decades.</P>
      <P>In addition to the heavy human casualties, the typhoon also
caused losses to agriculture totaling more than NT$6.2 billion
(US$179 million) as well as immeasurable damage to the island's
infrastructure, including roads and bridges, according to statistics
compiled by the National Fire Administration under the Ministry of
the Interior.</P>
      <P>Kuo, a legislator representing Taichung County in central Taiwan,
which was one of the areas seriously hit by floods, landslides and
mudslides triggered by the typhoon, stressed that the Chen
administration should put maintaining internal safety and security at
the top of the list of its priorities and temporarily shelve defense
expenditures.</P>
      <P>He said the Republic of China government should refrain from
incessantly increasing defense spending year by year and stop the
meaningless arms race with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Kuo urged the Ministry of National Defense to be "courageous"
enough to say "no" to the Bush administration regarding the mammoth
US$4 billion arms package, which includes four Kidd-class destroyers,
eight diesel-powered submarines designed to counter blockades and
invasions, 12 P-3 Orien Ai craft, and a Paladin self-propelled
artillery system.</P>
      <P>"A total of NT$140 billion would well be able to help the people
in disaster areas stand up again from the ruins, and the money would
definitely be better spent on this than on expensive weapons to be
left idly in warehouses," he noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kuo called for President Chen Shui-bian to make
genuine efforts toward generating funds for relief and rehabilitation
work instead of taking whirlwind tours to disaster areas that Kuo
said are designed and executed only as media events.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lin Chun-yi, a former administrator of the
Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration (EPA), has been
appointed the Republic of China's ambassador to the West African
state of The Gambia.</P>
      <P>Lin, 61, said in an interview with CNA that he takes great
pleasure in accepting his new assignment to serve the country.</P>
      <P>Lin, a biologist and environmental activist, said he will focus
his efforts on further cementing bilateral relations after assuming
his new post in the near future, particularly on promoting civilian,
economic and cultural exchanges.</P>
      <P>Lin said he is no stranger to Africa. During his service with a
Christian church in the United States, Lin recalled, he had been
assigned to Tanzania, Kenya and several other African states to
assist in establishing their biology teaching systems.</P>
      <P>"I also took the opportunity to conduct some biological and
ecological research programs. I have many fond memories of my life
and work in those countries. After leaving Africa, I still harbor a
special affection for that continent," an emotional Lin said, adding
that he was excited by his new mission.</P>
      <P>Lin said that although he is a novice in the diplomatic world, he
will devote his full energy to fulfilling his duty and contributing
to the ROC's diplomatic cause.</P>
      <P>He said he has been endeavoring to obtain more knowledge about
Gambia through the Internet. Noting that Gambia upholds freedom and
democracy and has a stable investment climate, Lin said he will push
for increased Taiwan investment in the West African state after
taking his new job.</P>
      <P>In his view, Lin said, local entrepreneurs can consider investing
in the electronics, power generation, agricultural, aquacultural and
livestock industries in Gambia.</P>
      <P>Touching on the heavy human casualties and property losses
inflicted by Typhoon Toraji-triggered mudslides in Taiwan's
mountainous regions in the central county of Nantou and the eastern
county of Hualien, Lin said he was saddened by the typhoon tragedy.</P>
      <P>Lin said he sounded warnings more than 10 years ago against the
over exploitation of the island's mountainous regions and Taiwan's
lax soil and water resources conservation efforts.</P>
      <P>"We are now paying the price for our past mistakes. In the face
of the recent disaster, we must from now on pay more heed to
environmental protection and forestation. Otherwise, we will
encounter even more adversities in the future," he noted.</P>
      <P>Lin resigned from the top EPA post early this year to take the
blame for the serious environmental pollution caused by oil slicks

coast.</P>
      <P>The pollution -- caused by about 1,100 tons of fuel that leaked

Kenting, part of a national park at Taiwan's southernmost tip.

    <HEADLINE>DPP CAUTIONS TSU AGAINST COOPERATION WITH OTHER PARTIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said Friday that if the Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) chooses to cooperate with other opposition parties after
the year-end legislative and county-head elections, then there will
be "no more" political stability in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Wu Nan-jen made the remarks one day after
the TSU spokesman, Su Chin-chiang, said that the TSU advocates
political stability but that this does not mean it will help the
ruling party. Su added that the TSU does not exist for the purpose of
opposing or helping any one political party.</P>
      <P>The TSU, a party to be headed by former Minister of the Interior
Huang Chu-wen, who is closely affiliated with Lee Teng-hui, the
former ROC president and ex-chair of the Kuomintang, will be formally
inaugurated Aug. 12. Lee had said earlier that he wants to help the
minority government of President Chen Shui-bian gain a stable
majority in the Legislature.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the DPP is appreciative of Lee's help, but he noted
that the deeds of the TSU head have departed from Lee's intentions.</P>
      <P>He said that the TSU, as an independent party, will certainly not
have to consider the views of any of the other political parties, but
that it should definitely consider the intentions of Lee, its
spiritual leader.</P>
      <P>Wu stressed that DPP Chairman Frank Hsieh expressed his concerns
about the nomination of TSU candidates for the year-end elections
during his meeting with Lee earlier. DPP officials have estimated
that one-fourth of the TSU candidates will have an affect on the
election prospects of the DPP's own nominees.</P>
      <P>Wu urged the TSU spokesman to show political sensibility, adding
that if the TSU chooses to cooperate with other political parties
after the election, then there will be "no more political stability"
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also said that the DPP is not too worried about the TSU,
adding that the DPP is not facing the problem of losing seats in the
elections but instead the question of how many seats it can gain in
the Legislature.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CENTRAL SCIENCE PARK LOCATION TO BE DECIDED BY END OF YEAR: NSC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The answer to the question of where exactly
Taiwan's third "silicon valley" will be located is expected to be
finalized by the Executive Yuan at the end of this year, an official
in charge of science and technology development said Friday.</P>
      <P>The exact location of the proposed Central Science-based
Industrial Park (CSIP) -- Taiwan's third such park following the
Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park (HSIP) in northern Taiwan and
the Tainan Science-based Industrial Park (TSIP) in southern Taiwan --
is expected to be decided in five months, said Huang Wen-hsiung, vice
chairman of the Cabinet-level National Science Council (NSC).</P>
      <P>Ground-breaking and initial development are expected to kick off
next year at the earliest, said Huang after presiding over the first
NSC meeting on the CSIP development project.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, a total of eight districts in five cities and
counties in central Taiwan are aggressively bidding to be the site of
the CSIP.</P>
      <P>Related officials from Hsitun in Taichung City, Chinshui and
Tahya in Taichung County, Changping and Erlin in Changhua County,
Tuku and Paochung in Yunlin County, and Puli and Chushan in Nantou
County attended the first NSC meeting exclusively at a CSIP location.
The officials included Taichung County Chief Liao Yung-lai and
Taichung City Mayor Chang Wen-ying, according to Huang.</P>
      <P>After the location of the planned science park in central Taiwan
is decided, Huang noted, actual development jobs are expected to
begin around the middle of 2002 as land requisition is expected to
take another half year to complete.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's science-based industrial parks, particularly the first
one located in Hsinchu, have been the cradle of the island's
high-technology development and the "jewel in the crown" of its
export-oriented industrial business.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER ORDERS REFORESTATON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Saddened by the heavy casualties and
property damage wrought by Typhoon Toraji, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung
ordered a national reforestation campaign Friday to stabilize
mountainous areas and restore a safe environment for the people.</P>
      <P>Addressing a press conference dubbed "Clutching Taiwan's Land
with the Roots of Trees" and hosted by the Government Information
Office four days after the devastating typhoon ravaged Taiwan, Chang
declared that the administration is determined to grapple with the
problem of unrelenting farming and excessive development islandwide
by carrying out widespread reforestation projects.</P>
      <P>Harshly criticizing the exploitation of farmland and the
relentless development for economic gains regardless of the negative
effects, Chang said the soil and water conservation-depleting betel
nut cultivation, which is one of Taiwan's worst "land killers" and
the root cause of many otherwise preventable landslides and mudslides
that occur when a typhoon strikes, must be ended once and for all.</P>
      <P>Chang stressed that the government will ban betel nut cultivation
and other "improper" farming methods and will "deal with them
squarely" so as to help address the mudslide problem at its roots.</P>
      <P>The national reforestation drive will begin in "geologically
precarious" regions, which comprise around 10,000 hectares of
hillside and slopeland that have become even more dangerous two years
after the deadly Sept. 21 earthquake of 1999, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>It is expected that reforestation will have been carried out on
5,600 hectares of this land by the end of 2004, with the planting of
some 10 million new trees, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The ambitious campaign is expected to create 400,000 work days
for local residents, particularly aboriginal people, who have
suffered high unemployment in recent years, the premier continued.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the geography of Taiwan features high peaks,
steep slopes, rapidly flowing rivers and a fragile soil system, Chang
said while accelerating reforestation in hilly regions continues,
greening and forestation plans will also be carried out in some flat
and low-lying areas.</P>
      <P>It is expected that some 8,000 hectares of plains and low-lying
areas -- mainly low-yield rice paddies -- will be the first targets
of the forestation plan, Chang said, adding that by doing so, the
"greened" areas will not only contribute to beautifying local
communities but will also help reduce the greenhouse effect in cities
caused by carbon dioxide discharged from factories and vehicles.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TOP PRC NEGOTIATOR WITH TAIWAN `AT ODDS' WITH MAINLAND PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's top negotiator with Taiwan
Wang Daohan no longer maintains close ties with mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin because of their different political concepts
and Jiang's arrogance, according to a Hong Kong magazine report.</P>
      <P>The report, carried in the latest issue of Open Magazine, said
the first rift in the Wang-Jiang relationship occurred in September
1999 when Taiwan was rattled by a devastating earthquake that claimed
more than 2,400 lives and left tens of thousands homeless.</P>
      <P>At that time, the report said, Wang, a former Shanghai mayor and
Jiang's mentor, had three times asked Jiang to allow him to head a
delegation of Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) staff to visit Taiwan to show concern for its
earthquake victims.</P>
      <P>However, the report went on, Jiang repeatedly rejected Wang's
requests, saying that mainland China "need not express regards for
Taiwan's pro-independence government."</P>
      <P>The report said that although Wang explained that his planned
visit was not aimed at showing concern for the Taiwan government, but
for the earthquake victims, Jiang still turned down Wang's request.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Wang had even assured Jiang that he
would not touch on any political issue during his stay in Taiwan.
Wang reportedly had told Jiang that his planned visit could achieve
political effects in winning Taiwan people's hearts during their time
of hardship. But Jiang turned a deaf ear to Wang's advice, the report
said.</P>
      <P>The report further said Wang had suggested that mainland China
should donate at least US$1 million to help Taiwan's earthquake
victims. Jiang again rejected Wang's suggestion and Beijing later
donated just US$100,000 toward Taiwan's post-quake relief programs.</P>
      <P>The report continued that the final incident that led to the
Wang-Jiang split occurred in March this year when they were
discussing in private the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP's)
transformation.</P>
      <P>During their closed-door meeting, the report said, Wang advised
Jiang to unveil an intraparty reform plan at the CCP's 16th national
congress as a response to rising public calls for political
modernization. In Wang's view, the report said, the CCP will be
trapped in a very embarrassing position if it fails to accelerate its
transformation from a revolutionary party into a socialist democratic
party.</P>
      <P>After Wang finished his speech, the report said, Jiang rudely
told Wang that he did not think Wang was in a position to address the
CCP's reform issue or its future prospects.</P>
      <P>The report said Wang was caught off-guard by Jiang's remarks as
the octogenarian party elder had never expected Jiang to made such a
response. Wang later told his friends that he was deeply disappointed
and embarrassed by Jiang's arrogance, the report said.</P>
      <P>It further said that during his week-long stay in Shanghai in
mid-June to attend a Beijing-initiated conference of the top leaders
of mainland China and four Central Asian countries, Jiang met with
all party elders in the Shanghai area except for Wang. The omission
has since caused much speculation in mainland political circles,
according to the report.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SENATOR SAYS BUSH ADMINISTRATION SEEMS MORE WILLING TO ENGAGE BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  2 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior U.S. senator said Thursday on
the eve of his trip to East Asia that the Bush administration seems
to have modified its attitude toward mainland China and now appears
more willing to "engage and embrace" the country.</P>
      <P>Joseph R. Biden, Jr., chairman of the powerful Senate Committee
on Foreign Relations, also said that he does not expect
administration officials to repeat President George W. Bush's
statement that the United States will do whatever it takes to defend
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Delaware Democrat made the comments while talking to
reporters before leaving for Taiwan, mainland China and South Korea
on his first overseas trip since becoming committee chairman six
weeks ago.</P>
      <P>Biden said that the Bush administration, when it took office six
months ago, "appeared to depart at least verbally, in body language,
from the last administration in terms of how it dealt with China".</P>
      <P>With Secretary of State Colin Powell's visit to Beijing in late
July, Biden said, the administration" seems to have moved back in the
direction of seeking to engage and embrace China".</P>
      <P>The issue of weapons proliferation looks set to dominate Biden's
discussions with the leadership in Beijing.</P>
      <P>On cross-strait issues, Biden told reporters from South Korea,
mainland China and Taiwan that the United States does not want to
communicate to Taiwan that "we will be with it no matter what it
does."</P>
      <P>"We're not for your independence," he said, adding that "if you
do that, you're on your own."</P>
      <P>"Conversely, mainland China should not have any doubt that if
they unilaterally decide to impose physical domination upon Taiwan,
then anything could happen, the minimum of which would be us
supplying the Taiwanese government with whatever it takes," he said.</P>
      <P>Biden, along with Sen. Paul Sarbanes (D-Md.), Sen. Arlen Specter
(R-Pa.) and Sen. Fred Thompson (R-Texas), is due to arrive in Taipei
on August 6. The senators will then visit Shanghai and Beijing August
7-10 before heading to Seoul.</P>
      <P>A liberal Democrat, Biden succeeded conservative Jesse Helms
(R-N.C.) as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee in June when
the Democrats won control of the Senate because of the defection of a
single Republican.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nantou County Magistrate Pang Pai-hsien
appealed Friday for the military and civilians to help residents in
his county, saying that typhoon Toraji wrecked more serious havoc to
the county than earlier thought.</P>
      <P>Pang, who has been inspecting the affected areas "day and night"
since the typhoon swept across Taiwan Sunday and Monday, made a
five-point suggestion after inspecting the affected areas in the
central Taiwan county again Friday.</P>
      <P>He first urged the military to speed up the construction of
makeshift bridges, adding that the typhoon had destroyed 43 bridges
in the county, rendering the delivery of goods and rescue services
more difficult.</P>
      <P>Pang also urged the military to increase its manpower support,
saying that there are still residents trapped in affected areas and
that more than 90 people are still unaccounted for. Nantou County
desperately needs military support for traffic clearing, household
cleaning and environmental disinfection, he said.</P>
      <P>Saying that Luku and Hsinyi townships are still cut off from the
outside world, Pang also asked for more airborne rescue efforts,
adding that helicopters are in severe short supply, which is slowing
down rescue efforts.</P>
      <P>Pang also requested the support of heavy equipment and vehicles
to help with rescues, goods deliveries and traffic clearing in the
shortest possible time.</P>
      <P>He also asked the military to provide support communications, as
well as water and electricity equipment repairs so that daily
necessities to the public can be resumed as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>As it is already five days since Toraji swept across Nantou
County leaving residents in the affected areas without water or
electricity and with food running short, health officials are
beginning to worry about the possibility of outbreaks of dysentery
and chickenpox.</P>
      <P>The health officials said that the elderly and the young are
already suffering from colds and diarrhea, while patients with high
blood pressure and asthma, as well as those who need dialysis, are
having difficulty seeking medical treatment, despite the operations

    <HEADLINE>SENATE BILL TO DENY BEIJING ACCESS TO U.S. CAPITAL MARKETS INTRODUCED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  2  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms on Thursday
introduced a bill in the Senate that if passed would deny companies
owned by the mainland Chinese government access to American stock and
bond markets.</P>
      <P>The bill introduced by the North Carolina Republican is designed
to encourage the full privatization of firms that are majority-owned
by the Communist regime in Beijing.</P>
      <P>The heavyweight senator emphasized that the United States "cannot
and should not subsidize the barbarous Communist Chinese government
when it tortures, imprisons and murders its own people."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Communist China ships missile technology and
weapons of mass destruction to "terrorist nations" and is blatantly
threatening democratic Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Helms added, Beijing is occupying Tibet and
oppressing mainland China's minorities and people of faith.</P>
      <P>The bill, which proposes to prohibit any government-owned
mainland Chinese companies from listing stocks or issuing bonds on
U.S. capital markets, is intended to deny the Chinese government
access to billions of dollars without costing any American jobs, the
senator explained.</P>
      <P>"Simultaneously, the bill will promote economic reform in China
by emphasizing that the United States favors privatized firms and
real Chinese entrepreneurs, who will be free to utilize U.S. capital
markets," he noted.</P>
      <P>"That is a truly free market policy. The need to end this subsidy
to the Chinese government is obvious," he emphasized.</P>
      <P>"Today, two majority government-owned companies, PetroChina and
Sinopec, do business with Sudan and Iran. The activities of these
companies, both listed on the New York Stock Exchange, prop up two
other governments that also abuse human rights and export terrorism
and religious intolerance," Helms pointed out.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the legislation he introduced "will help stave
off potential financial disaster that could otherwise await American
savers and investors."</P>
      <P>"As China continues to partially privatize its economy, its
government-owned companies are expected to dramatically increase
listings and offerings on U.S. exchanges, meaning that more and more
Americans would have Chinese government stocks and bonds in their
portfolios," he said.</P>
      <P>"Should there be a crisis in U.S.-China relations over Taiwan,
for example, the value of those securities is certain to collapse.
The savings of Americans must never be subjected to such a great
political risk," he stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC FREE TO NAME ENVOY TO APEC SUMMIT: MAC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China is free to name any
person as its representative at the annual informal leadership
meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, a
senior mainland China affairs official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-tung, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland
China, was responding to reports that Beijing will not allow Koo
Chen-fu, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), to attend
this year's APEC summit to be held in Shanghai in October.</P>
      <P>The SEF is a quasi-official intermediary body authorized by the
ROC government to handle cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges in the absence
of official ties.</P>
      <P>Noting that APEC is a regional economic cooperation forum, Chen
said Taiwan, as a full APEC member, has the right to freely name a
delegate to attend the annual APEC summit.</P>
      <P>"We hope mainland China can respect the international rules of
the game and all APEC members' legitimate rights," Chen said, adding
that mainland China, as the host country of this year's APEC
ministerial and leadership meetings, should treat each member with
respect and grace.</P>
      <P>In his view, Chen said, mainland China should refrain from any
name-calling and should instead extend a warm welcome to any delegate
appointed by the ROC authorities.</P>
      <P>APEC is one of the few international organizations that accept
both Taiwan and mainland China as members. Due to Beijing's
opposition, however, the ROC head of state has been barred from
attending the annual APEC leadership meeting in person and must
instead appoint a proxy to take part in the event on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Koo, a veteran tycoon and Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland
China, represented former ROC President Lee Teng-hui at the 1995,
1996 and 1997 APEC summit meetings.</P>
      <P>But a local newspaper quoted mainland officials in charge of
Taiwan affairs as having said recently that Taiwan should refrain
from designating Koo to attend the upcoming summit and should instead
appoint a delegate suitable for "the development of cross-strait
relations" to participate in the Shanghai event.</P>
      <P>According to mainland officials, Koo should not visit the
mainland before the two sides of the Taiwan Strait resume dialogue.
Mainland China has insisted that it will not resume regular dialogue
between the SEF and its mainland counterpart -- the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) -- until after Taiwan
accepts its "one China" principle, which downgrades the ROC to a
local-level government under the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, Presidential Office officials said they
could not understand what mainland China means by saying that Taiwan
should send "a person suitable for the development of cross-strait
relations" to the summit.</P>
      <P>In any case, the officials went on, President Chen Shui-bian has
not yet decided who will represent him at the Shanghai summit.</P>
      <P>"We hope mainland China will stop meddling in the purely economic
APEC meeting based on its own ideological thinking," said a close
aide to the president.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS DEBATE WHICH FUNDS TO USE FOR TYPHOON DISASTER RELIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling and opposition legislative caucuses
agreed Friday to allow the Executive Yuan to make emergency use of
what remains of the 2001 Tax Redistribution Fund if the money is to
be spent on disaster relief in the wake of Typhoon Toraji.</P>
      <P>With regard to a proposal by the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) legislative caucus to convene an extraordinary
legislative session to earmark additional budget toward disaster
relief, Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng said that the
Executive Yuan should use the available funds first.</P>
      <P>He said that the Cabinet has approximately NT$6.3 billion (US$182
million) at its disposal for disaster relief.</P>
      <P>If it were to be discovered that the allotted budget is
insufficient to cover relief-related expenses, he continued, then the
possibility of convening such a session could be discussed.</P>
      <P>He added that the Legislative Yuan will try to quickly handle any
proposal regarding the additional allocation of disaster relief money
in order to facilitate the Executive Yuan's relief work.</P>
      <P>Wang suggested that the Executive Yuan could also try to find a
flexible way to use a NT$2.3 billion (US$66 million) portion of the
Sept. 21 Earthquake Special Donation Fund and another NT$27.3 billion
(US$787 million) portion of the NT$100 billion (US$2.9 billion) Sept.
21 Earthquake Special Budget.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislative Whip Tsai Huang-lang expressed dissatisfaction
with the agreement to use the Tax Redistribution Fund because it is
meant to be allocated for the use of various local governments, not
for disaster relief.</P>
      <P>With regard to Wang's proposal to try to find a way to use the
budgets earmarked for post-quake reconstruction on post-typhoon
relief, Tsai said that those funds are meant for the rebuilding of
various quake-affected counties and cities and should not be dipped
into for typhoon relief.</P>
      <P>Tsai noted that the passage of Typhoon Toraji on Monday has
already caused estimated damage in excess of tens of billions of new
Taiwan dollars and claimed that "a mere few billion" will not be
enough to provide relief.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in response to opposition Kuomintang lawmakers'
comments that various government agencies have all earmarked budget
that could be put toward disaster relief, DPP Legislator Chen
Chin-jun claimed that these budgets are "not enough" to handle relief
and reconstruction needs.</P>
      <P>According to the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics, the combined allotted disaster relief budget of the
Council of Agriculture, the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of the
Interior and various county and city governments is approximately
NT$4.7 billion (US$136 million).</P>

    <HEADLINE>DONATIONS FOR TYPHOON RELIEF LESS FORTHCOMING THAN FOR 921 QUAKE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although the destruction wrought by Typhoon
Toraji on Taiwan is almost as serious as the disastrous earthquake
that hit Taiwan two years ago, public response toward relief efforts
has been lukewarm compared to the spontaneous outpouring of help and
sympathy after the quake, according to local newspaper reports Friday.</P>
      <P>The mass-circulation United Daily News said that the lukewarm
response may be the result of the economic sluggishness that has left
people with less disposable income, or public mistrust due to the
widespread government mismanagement and alleged theft of earthquake
funds by the authorities.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior set up three accounts to help
post-typhoon reconstruction and had collected NT$113,374,870
(US$326,728) as of Friday following a NT$20 million donation by the
Chi Mei Group.</P>
      <P>To assuage the public fear about possible mismanagement of the
donations, Minister of the Interior Chang Po-ya assured that "every
dollar collected will be used for the affected residents."</P>
      <P>Vice Interior Minister Lee Yi-yang also said that the use of
Sept. 21 donations needs to be investigated and he gave his assurance
that the ministry will monitor rigorously the use of the typhoon
donations.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu had
already donated one month of their salaries toward typhoon relief and
they urged government chiefs and civil servants to donate generously.</P>
      <P>It is expected that government agencies and political parties
will launch a donation campaign in the next few days.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (TSMC) donated only a
few million dollars this time, compared with NT$200 million donated
in the wake of the Sept. 21 earthquake.</P>
      <P>The Tzu Chi Buddhist Compassionate Relief Foundation, the largest
charity organization in Taiwan, has been collecting donations and has
begun distributing money to the needy.</P>
      <P>Private charity organizations reported a sharp contrast to the
wake of the Sept. 21 earthquake, for which private donations of
NT$14.6 billion were collected.</P>
      <P>The Chinese Fund for Children and Families Taiwan reported that
they were deluged with calls for donations after the quake but have
received far fewer calls this time.</P>
      <P>World Vision Taiwan also said that although it received around
100 calls inquiring about donations, only about half of the callers
actually remitted money. In the first month after the Sept. 21
earthquake, in contrast, it had collected NT$60 million.</P>
      <P>Despite the lukewarm response, some heartening stories have
surfaced, with one 82-year-old veteran who wished to remain anonymous
donating NT$1 million (US$28,818). Another veteran gave a check for
NT$1.2 million, allegedly his entire savings.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RESETTLEMENT OF DEVASTATED VILLAGES HARD TO CARRY OUT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Resettlement of villages devastated by
mudslides will be a hard task, but there is no other option for some
mountainous villages that are under constant threat of natural
disasters, a Council of Agriculture (COA) official said Friday.</P>
      <P>The official said that the council conducted a geological survey
after the disastrous earthquake of Sept. 21, 1999 that shows that 65
villages on the island are located in dangerous areas vulnerable to
landslides or debris and mudflows. The council suggested that at
least 12 villages should be evacuated as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The torrential rainfall Monday brought by Typhoon Toraji caused
large-scale floods of mud and debris to wipe out some mountainous
villages, leaving many villagers buried alive.</P>
      <P>Four villages in eastern Taiwan's Hualien County and in
mountainous Nantou County in central Taiwan were reduced to
wasteland, and the next torrential rainfall will very likely cause
more hazardous landslides and debris flows, according to the COA
official, who added that residents of these four villages should have
priority for resettlement.</P>
      <P>Most of the villagers are aboriginals reluctant to leave their
own land and to give up their farms or trade, and the government has
had difficulties carrying out similar resettlement plans in the wake
of past disasters. The inhabitants of the aboriginal Hsinyi village
in Nantou County, for instance, would flee the floods and landslides
in times of danger and return to their damaged homes afterwards. The
authorities have discussed permanent evacuation with the villagers
for the last eight years, but no consensus has yet been reached.</P>
      <P>Chairman Chen Po-chi of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development said that an overall plan is necessary for the villager
resettlement projects, while housing, education, job opportunities,
customs and culture should all be considered.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed that "budget constraints" will not allow the
government to invest in developing new townships, but said that what
the government can do at the moment is try to arrange for the
villagers to move to safe areas in environments they are familiar
with.</P>

Toraji, a military spokesman announced Friday.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Toraji, the 7th-most lethal to hit Taiwan since 1958, had

    <HEADLINE>MOFA PUSHING FOR PRESIDENTIAL VISIT TO DENMARK: FM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Tien Hung-mao
said Friday that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is making
every possible effort to pave the way for President Chen Shui-bian to
visit Denmark in November to receive an international award.</P>
      <P>Tien said Liberal International's (LI's) decision to present its
2001 Freedom Award to Chen is an honor for both the president himself
and for the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>"We appreciate the LI's goodwill in presenting the award to our
president, and MOFA certainly will enlist every possible means to
have President Chen travel to Denmark to receive the prestigious
award in person," Tien said.</P>
      <P>Over the past few months, Tien said, the MOFA has used nearly
every possible channel to push for the realization of Chen's Denmark
travel plan.</P>
      <P>Tien would not elaborate on MOFA's efforts, saying only: "We will
continue our efforts."</P>
      <P>MOFA officials said the ministry has been working to make Chen's
Denmark visit happen ever since the LI, a London-based international
alliance of liberal parties, decided to present its 2001 Freedom
Award to him in February.</P>
      <P>As the ROC does not maintain formal diplomatic ties with Denmark,
MOFA officials have consistently kept a low profile in their work,
but diplomatic sources said Denmark has already rejected MOFA's
request for a Danish visa for Chen through official channels.
Nevertheless, MOFA officials said they will continue trying other
channels to push for Chen's visit.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokeswoman Chang Siao-yue said earlier this week that
despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties, the ROC and Denmark
share common beliefs in freedom and democracy.</P>
      <P>Noting that boosting substantive ties with European countries is
one of MOFA's major goals, Chang said the ministry will redouble its
efforts to push for the realization of Chen's Denmark travel plan.
Because of Beijing's diplomatic embargo against Taiwan, no ROC head
of state has ever been allowed to visit any European country so far.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Presidential Office officials said that whether Chen
can visit Denmark Nov. 9-10 to receive the award in person will hinge
on the Danish government's attitude.</P>
      <P>The officials said Chen has not yet filed a visa application.
"We'll decide whether to apply for a Danish visa based on the
developments in the general international situation in the coming
months as well as on the Danish government's attitude," said a
presidential aide.</P>
      <P>If Denmark denies Chen's visa application, the aide said, the
chairman of the Liberal International may travel to Taiwan to present
the award to Chen.</P>
      <P>The LI groups liberal political parties in major countries around
the world. Taiwan's current ruling Democratic Progressive Party is a
member.</P>
      <P>In an interview with a Danish newspaper in March, Chen expressed
his hope that the Danish government will grant him a visa so that he
can receive the award at the LI annual conference, as the award
represents recognition of the pursuit of freedom and democracy by the
23 million people of Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei's preparations to launch its ninth
bid to join the United Nations have entered the final countdown, as
the New York-based world body is to call its annual general assembly
in mid-September.</P>
      <P>Republic of China Foreign Affairs Minister Tien Hung-mao said
Friday that the government has decided to rule out the possibility of
joining the U.N. as an observer and also pointed out that it has no
plans to join the international organization under a designation
other than the ROC.</P>
      <P>As the U.N. is a political and governmental body composed of
sovereign states, Tien said, any change in the nation's formal title
must be made in compliance with the ROC Constitution, a move which is
out of the power of his ministry.</P>
      <P>The foreign affairs minister made the remarks while answering
questions from reporters following the swearing-in ceremony of the
newly appointed representatives to France and Brazil -- Hsieh
Hsin-ping and Chou Kuo-jui.</P>
      <P>Tien revealed that the Executive Yuan will set up an
inter-ministerial task force, to be led by himself and by Executive
Yuan Secretary-General Chiou I-jen, to devise a more flexible,
efficient and dignified strategy for this year's U.N. bid. Taipei
will also coordinate with its diplomatic allies that traditionally
raise the proposal in favor of Taiwan's membership at the U.N.
assembly, he added.</P>
      <P>According to Tien, the content of those allies' proposals will be
quite similar to those put forward in the past and his ministry will
call a news conference Tuesday to give an explanation of this year's
proposal.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Friday that the Republic of China will decide who it will send to
represent Taiwan at the annual informal leadership meeting of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Shanghai later this
year. The ministry also said that mainland China has no right to
interfere in the matter.</P>
      <P>The MOFA was responding to media reports that mainland China will
reject Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation and
Taiwan's top negotiator with the mainland, to attend the APEC meeting
in October.</P>
      <P>The MOFA said that to participate in APEC activities is the right
and obligation of the members. As a full member and keen participant
of APEC, the ROC government hopes to fulfill its duty and make
contributions.</P>
      <P>The MOFA said that past ROC presidents have wanted to participate
in APEC meetings, but to preserve the harmonious operations of APEC
and to fully participate in the functions of APEC, the ROC has sent
envoys to represent its president each year.</P>
      <P>The MOFA said that the ROC government is happy to see that
mainland China is playing host to this year's event, but that the
mainland has no right to interfere with the decisions of the ROC
regarding its selection of its representative.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainalnd Affairs Council, echoed the same view
earlier by saying that the ROC is free to name any person as its
representative at the annual APEC meeting.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Chen Ming-tung said that APEC is a regional
economic cooperation forum and the ROC has every right to participate
in the meeting.</P>
      <P>APEC is one of the few international organizations that accept
both Taiwan and mainland China as members. Due to Beijing's
opposition, however, the ROC state of head has been barred from
attending past APEC leadership meetings in person and must instead
appoint a proxy to take part in the event on his behalf.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T CANNOT COPE WITH LARGE-SCALE REDUCTION IN TAX INCOME: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>

(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Director General of Budget, Accounting
and Statistics said Friday that the government would not be able to
cope with a large-scale reduction in tax income as suggested by
various industry groups.</P>
      <P>Lin Chuan said at the third financial panel meeting of the
Economic Development Advisory Conference slated to be held Aug. 24-26
that the government has already sold off all the state-owned company
stocks that it could, so any imbalance in government finance might
become more apparent in the next year or two.</P>
      <P>He said that stock income cannot be considered routine income,
and selling government bonds will produce negative effects and amount
to spending government savings.</P>
      <P>Lowering taxes will also cut into savings and reduce economic
competitiveness, he said, warning that Japan and the United States
ran into the same problem in the 1980s.</P>
      <P>With the government's annual current tax income at NT$900 billion
(US$26 billion) and its total annual budgeted expenditure at NT$1.6
trillion (US$46 billion), Lin said that Standard &amp; Poor's has lowered
Taiwan's credit rating because the government's current income from
stocks alone amount to NT$200 billion (US$5.8 billion).</P>
      <P>He went on to say that instead of simply giving a tax cut that
would cause decreased tax income, the tax system should be adjusted
and related measures planned.</P>
      <P>There should be a period of transition from a reliance on stock
income, he said, because if the budgeted income is lowered to NT$1.4
trillion (US$40 billion) immediately -- leading to a proportional
reduction in the expenditure -- the economy would be "seriously
hurt."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 3 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Chang Chun-hsiung
said Friday that he hopes Taiwan can maintain an economic growth rate
of 3 percent this year despite the global economic recession.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks during a meeting with a Canadian
parliamentary delegation, in which he also envisioned a 5 percent
economic growth rate for next year.</P>
      <P>The premier said Taiwan's economy is driven by foreign trade, and
at a time when the world is mired in economic woes, the government
will use huge public investments to prime the economy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economic growth is not gained by luck, but by the
nation's capacity to face challenges, Chang said, adding that now is
the time to overcome difficulties.</P>
      <P>In referring to the outflow of capital from Taiwan, Chang said
that this was not unusual. He said that as Taiwan's living standard
is rising, so are its labor costs. This being the case, it is natural
that local enterprises should try to survive by finding opportunities
abroad.</P>
      <P>Chang went on to say that if these enterprises can base their
headquarters in Taiwan, the island can serve as a global planning and
management center.</P>
      <P>However, Chang said, Taiwan's goal of being a regional operations
hub has been hindered by the stalemate in its ties with mainland
China. The premier emphasized that the government will do all it can
to maintain peace between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>For his part, Canadian congressman John McKay said the visit of
his delegation, composed of 14 parliamentary members from Canada's
four largest political parties, signaled Canada's friendship toward
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>McKay said the delegation appreciated the warmth and friendship
from the people on Taiwan during their stay. He said they will
continue promoting ties between the two countries when they return

equates the existence of the ROC with Taiwan independence.</P>

"don't join, don't support, don't agree" campaign of their own.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORESTRY OFFICIAL SAYS ILLEGAL BETEL NUT TREES TO BE UPROOTED BY 2004</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior official of the Forestry Bureau
under the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture said Friday that all
illegally planted betel nut trees found in national forests will be
uprooted by 2004.</P>
      <P>Illegally planted betel nut trees are a major contributor to soil
erosion and mudslides as was clearly demonstrated during the last
typhoon to pass over the island.</P>
      <P>Lee Tao-sheng, deputy director of the bureau, said that the
council has already removed many trees. At one point in the past,
some 3,673 hectares of illegally planted betel nut trees were on
national lands. Since the government has addressed the problem, there
are now only 1,818 hectares affected. The trees in this area are
expected to be removed by 2004, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that illegal betel nut plantations on private
land totals 11,122 hectares. Nantou County has the most betel nut
trees with 6,809 hectares, followed by Chiayi County with 5,662
hectares and Hualien County with 2,281 hectares.</P>
      <P>Clearing lands of illegal trees is not as easy as planting new
trees, Lee said, adding that the bureau expects to meet with
resistance from plantation owners and workers over the plan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS OUTPUT TO HIT US$ 8.7 B. IN 2005</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The production value of Taiwan's wireless
telecommunications industry will hit around NT$100 billion in 2001,
and the figure is expected to reach NT$300 billion (about US$8.7
billion) in 2005, a trade official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming made the remarks
at the establishment ceremony of the "3G Club" held at the Far
Eastern Plaza Hotel in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Expressing the hope that the formation of the business alliance
will help pool the wisdom of the local telecommunications industry,
and the academic and government sectors to create more advanced
products to grab a larger slice of the mainland Chinese and global
markets, Yiin said he believes that Taiwan's telecommunications
industry will take off after the opening of its market.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by the Industrial Technology Research
Institute, Yiin said the output of Taiwan's wireless
telecommunications industry totaled NT$31.9 billion in 2000, and the
figure is expected to jump to NT$100 billion for this year and NT$140
billion and NT$300 billion for 2002 and 2005, respectively.</P>
      <P>By 2005, Taiwan will emerge as one of the world's major suppliers
of wireless LAN products, such as third-generation cellular phones,
he predicted, adding that this will also lead to the innovation of
the local semiconductor, telecommunications, and software industries
to make them the locomotive of Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Yiin, however, pointed out that to achieve all these objectives,
Taiwan must develop five strategic products -- cellular phones, blue
tooth products, wireless Lan products, global positioning satellites
and application and content services -- and further integrate
cooperation in the local industries.</P>
      <P>The "3G Club" hopes to create a wireless telecommunications
application and invention center in Taiwan and cultivate local
professional talent for those sectors by actively promoting those key
strategies of the local third-generation wireless telecommunications
industry, he added.</P>
      <P>Leading local businesses, including Taiwan Cellular Phone Corp.,
Acer Communications and Multimedia Inc., Inventec Corporation,
Asustek Computer and Quanta Computer are 3G members, among others.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT CONSIDERS ENTERING LAWSUIT BETWEEN RCA AND WORKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 3 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said
Friday it was considering whether to serve as guarantor for former
Taiwan workers of the U.S. company RCA in their lawsuit against the
company for subjecting workers to occupational hazards.</P>
      <P>CLA officials said they are studying the legality for the
Cabinet-level agency to wade into civil disputes.</P>
      <P>Former RCA Taiwan workers who claim the company exposed them to
dangerous chemical solvents which predisposed them to various cancers
are deciding whether to sue the company.</P>
      <P>They plan to ask a court to temporarily impound RCA's assets in
Taiwan as a safeguard against their damage claims pending the court's
ruling, and thereby will be required to provide a deposit, usually
one-third of the value of their claims, as a counter safeguard to
compensate for any damage caused by the impound in case their claims
are denied.</P>
      <P>Since they intend to impound US$2.4 billion (US$69.76 million)
worth of RCA assets, they need to post a deposit of NT$800 million
(US$23.25 million).</P>
      <P>They asked the CLA to serve as their guarantor in the proposed
suit to persuade the court to waive the deposit requirement.</P>
      <P>CLA Vice Chairman Kuo Chi-jen said Friday that a three-year study
has failed so far to establish a link between the cancers suffered by
RCA workers and their occupations while in the employ of the company.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Kuo said a government's written guarantee is rare in
practice despite the fact that it is provided by law, and that the
council will fully examine the legal consequences of such a move
before making a decision.</P>
      <P>However, Wang Shih-szu, a labor rights advocate who represents
the RCA employees in the dispute, said the CLA has agreed to serve as
guarantor in the lawsuit, and will certify in the suit that the RCA
workers' diseases were related to their jobs.</P>
      <P>Wang said RCA invested in Taiwan in 1969 and had three plants
with about 30,000 employees at its peak until 1992 when it divested
from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In 1994, the Environmental Protection Administration found that
the company had dug wells at its Taoyuan plant to dispose of
hazardous liquids and declared the plant site "a permanent pollution
zone" in 1998.</P>
      <P>In 1997, many former RCA workers were found to be suffering from
various cancers. The number of RCA employees who developed cancer has
risen to 1,375 by 2001, in addition to many others suffering from
tumors. Among the cancer suffers, 216 have died already.</P>
      <P>The former RCA employees have demanded damages from the company
but have gotten no response thus far.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HOUSE RESOL'N FOR CONTINUED ENDORSEMENT OF ROC'S WHO BID INTRODUCED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  3  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two U.S. members of Congress have
introduced a House resolution calling on the Bush administration to
continue to endorse Taiwan's bid to obtain observer status at the
2002 annual meeting of the World Health Assembly in Geneva,
Switzerland.</P>
      <P>Rep. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Rep. Steve Chabot (R-Ohio)
pointed out that President George W. Bush stated in his May 11 letter
to Sen. Frank Murkowski (R-Ala.) that the United States "should find
opportunities for Taiwan's voice to be heard in international
organizations in order to make a contribution, even if membership is
not possible."</P>
      <P>In his letter Murkowski, Bush added that his administration "has
focused on finding concrete ways for Taiwan to benefit and contribute
to the World Health Organization."</P>
      <P>Moreover, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy
Thompson announced May 16 the Bush administration's support of
Taiwan's participation in the activities of the WHO when he attended
the last annual meeting of the World Health Assembly.</P>
      <P>Rep. Brown last February introduced House Resolution 428, which
urged the U.S. government to support Taiwan's participation in the
WHO, and 31 senators headed by Murkowski wrote to the U.S. president
in mid-March expressing their concerns about the administration's
efforts in helping Taiwan join the WHO as an observer.</P>
      <P>Following the passage of the resolution by both houses of
Congress earlier this year, President Bush signed it into law.</P>
      <P>The Brown-Chabot resolution is designed to amend that law so that
the Bush administration can continue planning to endorse and obtain
observer status for Taiwan to attend the World Health Assembly
meeting in Geneva next year.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  3  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Thirteen members of the U.S. House of
Representatives introduced a resolution Thursday that urges the Bush
administration to take a leading role in gaining international
support for Taiwan's participation in the United Nations and other
international organizations.</P>
      <P>The House concurrent resolution, introduced by Rep. Bob Schaffer
and twelve colleagues from both parties, points out that Taiwan and
its 23 million people "deserve full and equal membership in the
United Nations and other international organizations."</P>
      <P>Congressman Schaffer emphasized Friday that "Taiwan continues as
a beacon of freedom and democracy under the shadow of Communist
China. Taiwan's courageous dedication to democratic principles
reinforces its rightful place as a member of the United Nations. The
citizens of our great nation stand shoulder to shoulder with Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The resolution reaffirms the United States' commitment made in
the 1994 Taiwan Policy Review to actively support Taiwan's membership
in international organizations, said the Colorado Republican.</P>
      <P>It notes that the global community has reacted positively to
Taiwan's desire for international participation, as shown by Taiwan's
membership in the Asian Development Bank, its admission into the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum as a full member, and its
anticipated membership in the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>As evidenced above, the resolution says, Taiwan "possesses ample
resources and creativity to contribute to the work and funding of the
United Nations and its affiliate organizations, such as the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund, as well as benefit from
these organizations."</P>
      <P>Rep. Schaffer, together with 40 congressional colleagues,
introduced a similar House resolution last year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT INSPECTS TYPHOON-TORN COUNTIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Nantou  County,  central  Taiwan,  Aug.  4  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen
Shui-bian inspected the counties of Nantou, Chiayi and Yunlin on
Saturday to survey the damage caused by Monday's Typhoon Toraji.</P>
      <P>Toraji now ranks as the sixth-most lethal typhoon to hit Taiwan
since 1958, the year when the government began maintaining records on
typhoon casualties. As of early afternoon Saturday, the death toll
from Toraji had risen to 89, with another 133 people still
unaccounted for.</P>
      <P>In the village of Fengshan in Chiayi's Alishan Rural Township,
residents appealed to Chen for help and suggested that the government
can aid in resolving the serious landslide and mudflow problems in
the area while adding to the government's coffers by exporting the
gravel deposits that were washed down the mountains during the
typhoon.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi warned that such a
proposal might involve legal issues, but Chen said that exceptions
can be made through policy changes if amending related laws might
take too long to be of any use to dealing with the urgent matter.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice President Annette Lu, who was inspecting another
village in the same rural township, said that as the chairwoman of
the presidential science and technology advisory committee, she will
try to import the necessary technology to make the most effective use
of the stones and gravel.</P>
      <P>Lu added that Taiwan can try to follow the example of Japanese
companies that turn these kinds of stones and gravel into floor tile
products.</P>
      <P>In Nantou, military and police helicopters took advantage of the
fair weather to transport more relief materials to various rural
areas that were completely cut off from the rest of the country due
to destroyed or blocked roads.</P>
      <P>According to government estimates, reconstruction projects in the
wake of Toraji will cost approximately NT$10 billion (US$288
million).</P>
      <P>Therefore, Minister-without-Portfolio Chen Chin-huang warned that
the agreement struck by ruling and opposition legislative caucuses
Friday to allow the Executive Yuan to use what remains of the fiscal
2001 Tax Redistribution Fund will not be enough to cover the foreseen
expenditures.</P>
      <P>The government estimates that total agricultural, forestry,
fishing and livestock losses including damage to agricultural
facilities amount to approximately NT$6.6 billion (US$190 million).

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT CONSULTATIONS SHOULD NOT BE 'PRIVATIZED': OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  4  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"No privatization" is the government's
bottom line for consultations between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait, a senior official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Cabinet Secretary-General Chiou I-jen made the remarks at a
meeting of the cross-strait panel under the Economic Development
Advisory Conference (EDAC).</P>
      <P>During the session, many panel members, including opposition
lawmakers and business executives, criticized the government's
for its alleged reluctance to liberalize cross-strait commercial
exchanges and open direct "three links" -- trade, mail and
transportation.</P>
      <P>They said the government has often resisted the appeals for
easing the existing "go slow, be patient" policy on mainland
China-bound investment and for opening of direct cross-strait "three
links" on the ground that such moves may jeopardize Taiwan's national
security.</P>
      <P>In response, Chiou said both easing the "go slow" policy and
opening direct cross-strait "three links" involve many complex
problems, not just national security issues.</P>
      <P>Noting that such new opening measures could accelerate capital
outflow and further drive up the unemployment rate, Chiou said the
government must exercise prudence in handling relevant affairs.</P>
      <P>Chiou pointed out that Beijing's "one China" precondition for
resuming cross-strait dialogue entails "high price" for Taiwan
to endure.</P>
      <P>In his view, Chiou said Taiwan would have to pay a "price" if it
accepts Beijing's "one China" principle, which downgrades the
Republic of China to a local-level government under the People's
Republic of China -- mainland China's official national title.</P>
      <P>Chiou said the current Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has no
intention of using the "go slow" and "three links" issues as
bargaining chips for cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>At the moment, Chiou said, stumbling blocks indeed exist
in resuming cross-strait talks. "We are certainly willing to
make every possible effort to push for resumption of cross-strait
dialogue," Chiou said, adding that the government's bottom line for
cross-strait talks is that they should not be completely privatized
and should be handled by officially authorized organizations.</P>
      <P>The session was co-chaired by Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, Acer Group Chairman Stan Shih and Wu
Jung-yi, head of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, a private
think tank.</P>
      <P>This was the panel's third meeting since its formation in late
July. The panel is expected to come up with a package of proposals
for further discussion at the EDAC scheduled for Aug. 24-26.</P>
      <P>The panel will mainly address five categories of issues regarding
cross-strait ties -- adjustment of the "go slow" policy; the timing
for opening "three links"; mechanism for cross-strait capital flow;
opening the door to mainland Chinese tourists; and strategy for
coping with problems that may arise following Taipei's and Beijing's
accession to the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>During Saturday's meeting, all panel members agreed to hold
special sessions to solicit opinions of senior executives of
foreign-owned companies on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Starting Monday, the panel will also hold a series of seminars in
different parts of the island to seek opinions of people in
various social quarters on future government cross-strait
policies.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the panel has decided to invite relevant national
security officials to brief its members on the possible impact of
cross-strait economic relations on national security.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 4 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chu Yun-peng, one of the 120 members of the
upcoming Economic Development Advisory Conference, predicted Saturday
at a technology and economics seminar that Taiwan's annual economic
growth is unlikely to reach 2 percent this year.</P>
      <P>Chu, an economics professor at National Taiwan University, said
at the National Policy Foundation-organized seminar that although
Taiwan's first-quarter growth was merely 1.06 percent and growth for
the second and third quarters appears just as sluggish, he believes
the fourth quarter will see some improvements and will register a
better performance than last year's fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>However, Chu, who is also a researcher at Academia Sinica's
Institute of Social Sciences, added that Taiwan's fourth quarter
recovery will still depend on whether the U.S. economy recovers. He
added that even if the U.S. economy does begin to pick up, the trend
will only help the domestic information technology industry and will
have no effect on domestic consumption-based industries or the
construction industry.</P>
      <P>With regard to the possibility that the government might yield to
industry pressure to imitate the U.S. administration's move to cut
taxes in order to stimulate economic recovery, Chu expressed his
doubt about the effectiveness of such a policy.</P>

(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Saturday that
emigration is an option for solving Taiwan's overpopulation problem.</P>
      <P>She made the remark Friday while inspecting areas in central
Taiwan devastated by Typhoon Toraji which swept across the island
Monday, causing flooding, landslides and mudflows that left many
people dead and many more missing.</P>
      <P>She said that people in Taiwan must recognize the pressing
problem of overpopulation and suggested emigration as a possible
option to be considered by authorities working out a long-term
population policy. However, she added that there is no immediate need
for such an emigration policy and that it would not be compulsory if
implemented.</P>
      <P>Lu said that natural disasters plus manmade damage to Mother
Nature have brought catastrophic consequences, pointing out that
Taiwan's overused land needs time to rehabilitate.</P>
      <P>She said that, living in a nation surrounded on all sides by
water, the people of Taiwan should demonstrate the spirit of
expedition by seeking opportunities overseas instead of continuing to
exploit and develop the island's mountainous areas and thereby give
Taiwan back its beautiful natural landscape.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN COMPUTER FIRMS TO FACE SEVERE COMPETITION FROM M'LAND: DELL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  4 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An executive of Dell Corp.'s international
procurement office (IPO) in Taipei said that Dell's decision to move
its Asia-Pacific IPO from Taipei to Hong Kong will not affect its
purchases from Taiwan in the short term but added that computer firms
in mainland China are potential competitors Taiwan cannot ignore.</P>
      <P>Fang Kuo-chien, general manager of computer giant Dell's IPO in
Taipei, said that the Taipei IPO office will not shrink, although the
IPO office in mainland China will continue to expand.</P>
      <P>Since Dell has long-term contracts with its Taiwan suppliers,
Fang said that cooperation relationships and strategic alliances with
these suppliers have not changed. He added that if Dell considers
changing suppliers, it will not be an immediate decision.</P>
      <P>Fang said some of Dell's Taiwan suppliers have been making
deliveries from their factories in mainland China, where the
production costs are comparably lower. Mainland China is considered
by all international computer firms as one of the most important
markets as well as potential OEM suppliers.</P>
      <P>While leading international computer firms, such as IBM and
Toshiba, have invested in manufacturing plants on the mainland, Fang
said that Taiwan companies are in a disadvantageous position due to
government restrictions.</P>
      <P>He said that he considers that Taiwan still maintains the
advantage in terms of technology and international business
experience. However, the lack of Taiwan authorities' flexibility will
weaken the competitiveness of the island's companies, he added.</P>
      <P>Dell's decision to move its Asia-Pacific IPO to Hong Kong is a
pragmatic adjustment in the company's operations in this part of the
world, Fang said. He would not rule out the possibility that Dell may
move the office back to Taipei in the future when direct
transportation links between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
exist.</P>

party's goal is to send PFP Chairman James Soong into the
Presidential Office in 2004.</P>
      <P>Criticizing the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
"ineptitude," the main opposition Kuomintang's "historic burden," and
the opposition New Party's "expected bubble-bursting," Chang said
that only the PFP can represent "60 percent" of the Taiwan mainstream
without regard for ethnic or north-versus-south differences.</P>
      <P>Chang said while visiting the offices of the PFP candidates in
Tainan City who were nominated by the party to run in the year-end
legislative elections that Soong's past experience as Taiwan
provincial governor -- when he visited all 309 townships in the
nation several times -- is his party's "largest resource."</P>
      <P>Therefore, Chang said that the PFP decided to nominate two
candidates in Tainan despite criticism from one candidate's camp that
the move would force him out of the race because some believe that
the party will win only one seat in the city.</P>
      <P>He said that he hopes both nominees will be elected to the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>He explained that as the convener to a committee in charge of
nominating candidates, he and the seven committee members agreed that
if every region were to field only one PFP candidate, there would
only be a total of 28 candidates -- less than even the opposition New
Party, which nominated 35 people, and the soon-to-be-established
Taiwan Solidarity Union, which is fielding 41 candidates.</P>
      <P>He added that Soong also supports the decision to nominate more
than one candidate per election precinct.</P>

    <HEADLINE>YEH SHENG-MAO APPOINTED NEW INVESTIGATION BUREAU CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Yeh Sheng-mao, newly appointed director of
the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB), said Saturday he
will do his utmost to fulfill his duty after assuming office.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) announced in a news release late
Friday that it has decided to promote Yeh from the MJIB deputy
director post to the bureau's directorship due to practical needs.</P>
      <P>Yeh, 58, has climbed the ladder from local investigator to the
top MJIB post. He was head of the Taipei City Government's
anti-corruption department before becoming the MJIB deputy director.</P>
      <P>Throughout his career, Yeh has been noted for his low-profile,
self-effacing working style, sources familiar with Yeh said.</P>
      <P>According to the MOJ press release, Justice Minister Chen
Ding-nan took the initiative in promoting Yeh to head the MJIB,
Taiwan's equivalent of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.</P>
      <P>The press release said Premier Chang Chun-hsiung approved Yeh's
promotion Friday. As for the outgoing bureau chief Wang Kuang-yu's
new assignment, the news release said it will be announced later.</P>
      <P>MJIB sources said the government originally planned to appoint
Wang as a national policy adviser to the Republic of China president.
But Wang has reportedly shown little interest in assuming such a
post.</P>
      <P>Justice Minister Chen would not make any comment on the abrupt
personnel change.</P>
      <P>MJIB sources said Chen's decision to replace Wang with Yeh might
be aimed at facilitating the government's plan to set up an
independent anti-corruption agency to eradicate official corruption
and establish clean politics.</P>
      <P>Wang had voiced opposition to the proposal of forming an
independent anti-corruption agency. The MJIB's current functions
include cracking down on official corruption and drug trafficking, as
well as investigating major economic crimes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC, U.S. REACH CONSENSUS ON JUDICIAL ASSISTANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Negotiators from the Republic of China and
the United States have reached a consensus on bilateral judicial
assistance after a week of talks, according to reports from
Washington, D.C. Saturday.</P>
      <P>The reports said the two sides have agreed to sign a memorandum
of understanding (MOU) on bilateral judicial assistance and
cooperation in the near future, marking an instance of international
recognition of the ROC's judicial sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Diplomatic sources said Taiwan-U.S. negotiations over judicial
assistance had been stalled for nearly three years before seeing a
breakthrough after the inauguration of U.S. President George W. Bush.</P>
      <P>With a view to combating international crime, the Bush
administration recently took the initiative in expressing its
willingness to sign a judicial assistance agreement with the ROC.</P>
      <P>A delegation of officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) left
for Washington, D.C. last week to discuss with their American
counterparts the details of possible cooperation.</P>
      <P>During their weeklong talks, representatives from the two sides
reached a consensus on exchanges of criminal information, mutual
access to judicial documents and evidence, and repatriation of
criminal suspects.</P>
      <P>The two sides have also agreed to allow their law enforcement
officers to question witnesses and defendants in each other's
territory and to assist each other in arresting and deporting
fugitives or criminal suspects.</P>
      <P>At the request of the United States, MOJ officials said, the two
sides will strengthen cooperation in cracking down on illegal drug
trafficking, including the smuggling of contraband controlled drugs,
covert investigations and examination of drug originating sources.</P>
      <P>As the ROC has yet to legislate regulations governing covert
investigations and the delivery of controlled drugs, the officials
said they hope the Legislative Yuan can accelerate the legislative
process in preparation for signing the judicial assistance accord
with the United States.</P>
      <P>Judicial sources said the 10-member U.S. delegation was composed
of officials from the State Department, the Justice Department and
the American Institute in Taiwan, a quasi-official organization
authorized to handle relations with the ROC in the absence of formal
diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>The eight-member Taiwan delegation was composed of officials from
the ROC representative office in the United States, the Ministry of
Justice, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Criminal
Investigation Bureau.</P>

      <P>Chief of the General Staff General Tang
Yao-ming is scheduled to visit the United States next week, military
sources said Sunday.</P>
      <P>This will be General Tang's first U.S. visit in his capacity as
chief of the general staff of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Washington D.C., General Tang is scheduled to
meet high-ranking U.S. military officers, possibly including U.S.
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, for discussions on the
establishment of Taiwan's next-generation arms, the cross-strait
situation and bilateral intelligence exchanges.</P>
      <P>The United States has been the most important provider of
defensive weapons to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense, however, would not comment on
General Tang's coming U.S. visit. But military officials said that it
is a routine matter that the chief of the general staff and the
commanders-in-chief of all branches of the armed forces were invited
to visit the United States during their tenures.</P>
      <P>If General Tang meets with Rumsfeld, it will be the first meeting
between the top military officials of the two nations since U.S.
President George W. Bush took office in January.</P>
      <P>Local media recently reported that General Tang has been tapped
to be appointed the new defense minister after the next Cabinet
reshuffle.</P>
      <P>General Tang's predecessor, General Tang Fei, visited the United
States in his capacity as the chief of the general staff shortly
before he was promoted to defense minister in 1998.</P>
      <P>General Tang Fei's Washington trip contributed greatly to the
upgrading of Taiwan-U.S. intelligence cooperation, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Tang Fei was named premier by President Chen Shui-bian after Chen
was sworn in May 2000.</P>
      <P>The sources said that the chief of the general staff is expected

stationed in the United States.</P>

      <P>According to Lee, there exists a draft agreement which has served

related to each other's rights and obligations, and details such as
evidence gathering must be approved by Taiwan's legislature, he
pointed out.</P>
      <P>Lee, however, said that the sensitive issue regarding the

acknowledged that it is still quite difficult for Taiwan's judicial

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Tien Hung-mao
said Monday that joining the World Health Organization (WHO) is the
long-term policy of the Republic of China government, however,
whether the goal can be reached depends largely on the help of the
United States.</P>
      <P>U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson
announced May 16 the Bush administration's support of Taiwan's
participation in the activities of the WHO when he attended the
annual meeting of the World Health Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland.</P>
      <P>Although Thompson's announcement was made after Taiwan's WHO bid
had been rejected, his remarks, the first from a U.S. administration,
still signaled important meaning for ROC's WHO bid next year.</P>
      <P>Tien noted that besides the private sector's efforts in pushing
for Taiwan's participation in the WHO, the government's preparations
have never been interrupted. However, he added, whether Taiwan can
enter the WHO will depend on whether the U.S. administrative branch
will help.</P>
      <P>Moreover, two U.S. congressmen -- Rep. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and
Rep. Steve Chabot (R-Ohio) -- have introduced a House resolution
calling on the Bush administration to continue to endorse Taiwan's
bid to obtain observer status at the 2002 annual meeting of the World
Health Assembly in Geneva.</P>
      <P>Besides, U.S. President George W. Bush stated in his May 11
letter to Sen. Frank Murkowski (R-Ala.) that the United States
"should find opportunities for Taiwan's voice to be heard in
international organizations in order to make a contribution, even if

    <HEADLINE>DPP PARTY OFFICIAL SUPPORTS GOVERNMENT TO AX BETEL PALM TREES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  5  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will support the government's decision to cut down betel palm
tress, said DPP Secretary-General Wu Nei-jen Sunday.</P>
      <P>Wu said his party would subordinate its political interests to
the welfare of the country as a whole as long as the government's
decision is based on scientific studies.</P>
      <P>Admitting that the destruction of betel palm plantations could
damage the livelihood of growers and sellers, Wu said it is the
supreme goal of the DPP to pursue the nation's long-term interests.</P>
      <P>Some DPP lawmakers elected from betel palm-growing areas might
take issue with the government's decision to cut down the trees, Wu
said, but their objections will not sway the party's determination to
defend the overall welfare of the country.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsai Huang-liang, DPP whip at the legislature, aired
his opposition last week to the destruction of the betel palm trees
in the absence of measures to compensate growers.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the government should not blame the growers for
Taiwan's mudslides which are often triggered by torrential rains and
often claim lives.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung is expected to meet with DPP lawmakers
later Sunday to solicit their support for the government's decision.</P>
      <P>Chang announced that the government would uproot betel palm
plantations on the island's steep mountain slopes after Typhoon
Toraji wrought havoc in eastern and central Taiwan on July 30.</P>
      <P>The betel palm trees are grown for their seeds which are chewed
along with spices as a popular mild stimulant by local people. The
tree's shallow roots are blamed by environmentalists as the main
cause of landslides in mountainous areas.</P>
      <P>A large number of people depend on the cash crop for survival,
however, and taking away the livelihoods of growers and sellers is
expected to put a great deal of pressure on the local and central
governments. Observers say that the situation may pit the government
and environmentalists against farmers and sellers of betel nuts and
could result in political fallout.</P>
      <P>The question is especially sensitive to the DPP since betel palm
plantations are common in central and southern Taiwan which is the
power base of the DPP.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RISK  MANAGEMENT MECHANISM NEEDED TO GOVERN CROSS-STRAIT EXCHANGES: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   5   (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), said Sunday that the
government needs to establish a risk management mechanism regarding
mainland Chinese tourists to Taiwan and Chinese capital investment in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tsai made the remarks while presiding over a symposium of the
Economic Development Advisory Conference in Hualien, eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tsai also said that the MAC has completed the first stage of its
review of the "no haste, be patient" policy of investment on the
mainland, and some adjustments have been made, including the lifting
of the ban on financial institutions to open representative offices
on the mainland. The next stage will be to open domestic banks to
have remittance services with their mainland counterparts, she said.</P>
      <P>Participants in the symposium were most concerned about allowing
mainland Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan and pointed out that
Hualien would benefit from the move.</P>
      <P>Tsai said whether or not to go ahead with the plan will hinge on
the development of the tourism industry in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>She also said that whether the issue was mainland tourists or
Chinese investment in Taiwan, a mechanism to manage risk would have
to be established.</P>
      <P>Tzeng Hsin-hsiung, one of the participants and president of the
Association of Rock and Mineral Products in Taiwan, asked the
government to consider the survival of traditional industries after
the opening, adding that the opening of mainland products to Taiwan
will affect the survival of traditional industries, especially the
rock and mineral products of mainland's marble and granite
industries.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in another EDAC meeting held in Taichung, central
Taiwan, most of the participants urged the government to ease the "no
haste, be patient" policy toward investing in the mainland.</P>
      <P>In the meeting presided over by Acer Group Chairman Stan Shih,
Tsai Yu-ching, one of the business participants, expressed the hope
that the government would sign a 50-year peace agreement, investment
guarantee agreement and tax agreement with the mainland as soon as
possible.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Chia-chi, director of the Bureau of Economics of the
Taichung City Government, said that cross-strait exchanges are very
close to becoming a reality, but regulations governing such exchanges
have not been revised for a decade, and he urged the MAC to revise
outdated regulations soon.</P>
      <P>Cheng Ching-hsiung, secretary-general of the Taichung County
Government, said that Taichung harbor can be used as a port for
direct cross-strait shipping links, saying that it is well-suited for
the purpose and is geographically nearest to the mainland.</P>
      <P>He also expressed the hope that the central government would make
good on its promises to establish an international airport in central
Taiwan, upgrade Taichung into a municipality under the direct
jurisdiction of the Cabinet and establish the third science-based
industrial park there.</P>
      <P>Professor Chang Wan-tung of Fujen Catholic University said that
the government's mainland policy was formulated based on facts as
understood two decades ago, but Taiwan's security should be built on
economics, not only on the concept of a possible military
confrontation with China.</P>
      <P>Yunlin County planning official Hsu Ming-wen said that the
county's Maioliao Harbor has the advantages of being a deep-water
port and superb facilities, and if the government does not want to
open direct trade immediately, then it can designate Maioliao as a
special economic zone and use it as the basis for the development of
Taiwan's traditional industries.</P>

and Tsai Ling-lan, want candidates to save some of the ad money that
would be spent and instead put it toward the educations and living
expenses of children affected by the recent deadly typhoon.</P>
      <P>The legislators suggested that the funds could be used to educate
the children until they graduated from college at age 22.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that they will ask that the KMT actively take part in
the campaign when the party convenes a regular meeting of the KMT
Central Standing Committee Wednesday. Hsu said that the hope was that
the effort could be supported by the KMT to make a positive impact on
society.</P>
      <P>He also urged a rigorous review of the current disaster rescue
system, adding that he will suggest that the KMT push the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party to increase personnel and the budget for
disaster rescue operations.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Toraji has left 93 people dead and caused severe property
damage, mainly in Nantou County in central Taiwan and Hualien County
in eastern Taiwan after it swept across Taiwan July 29-30.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC  TO SIGN  JUDICIAL ASSISTANCE PACT WITH UNITED STATES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  5  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) said Sunday
that if all goes well, the Republic of China will sign a judicial
assistance agreement with the United States to jointly combat crime.</P>
      <P>Justice officials noted that after years of effort, the
negotiations between the ROC and the United States finally bore fruit
last week, with the negotiating team from the Ministry of Justice
reaching a consensus on bilateral judicial assistance with their U.S.
counterparts.</P>
      <P>They said that after the return of the team, the ROC and the
United States will first initial the agreement and then formally sign
it after the signing of a memorandum of understanding.</P>
      <P>It has been learned that the agreement will possibly cover an
anti-drug campaign, a cooperation project to identify the sources of
the drugs, a framework to map out the regulations governing the
control of drug delivery and undercover investigations, the
establishment of a system for tracking large amounts of money
transactions and the purchase of X-ray machines to inspect shipping
containers.</P>
      <P>The officials said that past MOJ heads, including Liao
Cheng-hao, Cheng Chung-mo, Yeh Chin-feng and even the current
Justice Minister, Cheng Ding-nan, have actively promoted the signing
of the agreement, but the breakthrough only came last week.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that after the United States listed Taiwan as
a major drug transshipment center in 1995, all MOJ heads have
stressed to the United States that Taiwan has been doing all it could
to stop the flow of illegal drugs into and through the country.</P>
      <P>The MOJ's teams, joined by officials from the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of the Interior have
traveled to the United States to explain Taiwan's anti-drug efforts
and its achievements.</P>
      <P>The MOJ was elated when it learned that the United States had
removed Taiwan from the list of drug transshipment countries early
this year and has actively worked toward the signing of the judicial
assistance agreement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US ENERGY CONSULTANT OFFERS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NUCLEAR WASTE DISPOSAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  5  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A former U.S. energy official Sunday
recommended that Taiwan use an international conference to determine
where to dispose of its nuclear waste.</P>
      <P>Ernest J. Moniz, former undersecretary of the Department of
Energy under the Clinton administration, told Taiwan's Central News
Agency July 31 in an interview in Taipei that an international
conference might help the island find a suitable place to store its
nuclear waste.</P>
      <P>Moniz made the recommendation after Taiwan was stymied in its
negotiations to ship its nuclear waste to North Korea or Russia for
permanent storage.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Taiwan Power Company, which runs the island's three
nuclear plants, has contacted Moscow and Pyongyang over the
possibility of having them keep the company's radioactive waste.</P>
      <P>Pyongyang agreed to accept Taiwan's nuclear waste in return for
cash but this was scuttled because of strong objections from Seoul,
which blamed Taiwan for trying to make the Korean Peninsula into its
nuclear waste dumping site.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's contact with Moscow looks more promising after Moscow
enacted a law in June to allow the government to dispose of processed
nuclear waste from other states.</P>
      <P>Moniz, now a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, has been recruited as a government adviser to Taiwan on
science and technology.</P>
      <P>He said Washington will not interfere with Taiwan's decision
where to dispose of its nuclear waste but he said that Washington has
always been opposed to the export of highly radioactive nuclear waste
out of concerns that it might be re-processed into materials for
nuclear weapons.</P>
      <P>An international conference bringing together related parties
such as Taiwan, Japan, South and North Korea, mainland China, Russia
and the United States would be an ideal forum to help Taiwan find a
place to dispose of its nuclear waste, Moniz said.</P>
      <P>Moniz arrived in Taiwan last week to attend an energy conference
between July 31 and Aug. 2 in his capacity as the government's
adviser.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RECESSION BRINGS CHANCE TO DEVISE STRATEGIES: BUSINESS LEADER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  5  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Now is a good time for the government to
work out overall economic strategies for Taiwan's industries at a
time when most local businesses have been hit by an economic slump, a
prominent leader of the local small business community said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Day Sheng-tong, chairman of the Small-and-Medium sized Business
Association, told Taiwan's Central News Agency in an exclusive
interview that the current recession provides a good opportunity for
the government to iron out long-haul economic strategies, rather than
short-term tactics, to create a sound environment to help revive
Taiwan's industries.</P>
      <P>"As long as Taiwan's environment is good enough, local small
businesses will be able to take off again," he said.</P>
      <P>Talking about the current economic slowdown which has pushed many
Taiwan traditional and high-tech businesses to relocate to mainland
China, Day attributed the situation to a booming stock market over
the past five years. High profits taken out of the local bourse have
lured over three million families to invest in the market, resulting
in a "marginalization of industries" on the island, he said.</P>
      <P>The craze for speculating in the lucrative bourse has made the
people forget how Taiwan managed to stand up on its own two feet in
the past, Day said. But he stressed optimistically that "Taiwan's
future is bright as long as the government works out a long-haul
economic development strategy."</P>
      <P>Looking back, Day said the exodus of Taiwan's
small-and-medium sized businesses to mainland China was the result
of inadequate government policies which viewed small businesses --
once the locomotive of the country's economy -- as "sunset
industries" in an attempt to better promote high-tech industries. But
many Taiwan-based high-tech firms are also undecided whether or not
should they move to the mainland now, he noted.</P>
      <P>Echoing the opinion of the worldwide renown strategist Michael E.
Porter, who visited Taiwan last month, Day said that Taiwan companies
have paid too much attention in seeking ways to lower their
production costs, which have in turn made them ignore the importance
of hammering out strategies for their businesses.</P>
      <P>As to the high-profile Economic Development Advisory Conference
being sponsored by the government to seek solutions to Taiwan's
sluggish economy, Day said the most import task for the conference is
to draw up "strategies" rather than "tactics," and called for broad
vision to achieve the objective.</P>
      <P>In the face of fierce competition from mainland China, which
boasts of a cheap labor force, the small business leader called it
"unfair competition" and urged the government and local businesses to
reassess Taiwan's position and to travel their own paths.</P>
      <P>Regarding the question of how to save Taiwan's small business
sector, Day proposed a rating system be set up by the government to
help companies deal with banks in case of a loan request based on
their personnel quality, research and development abilities,
credibility and earnings.</P>
      <P>In addition, he contended that the government should also ease
its restriction on bank loans to small businesses. "Taiwan's small
businesses are tenacious and flexible, and they will manage to stand
on their feet again if the government is capable of creating a
financially loose climate for them," he concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLL FINDS INCUMBENT TAIPEI MAGISTRATE OUTSHINES OTHER HOPEFULS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  6  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While the opposition camp is still
squabbling over who should represent it in the year-end election for
Taipei county chief, an opinion poll found that incumbent Taipei
Magistrate Su Chen-chang outshines any possible opposition hopefuls.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 938 eligible Taipei county voters conducted
by the mass-circulation Chinese-language United Daily News (UDN)
Sunday evening found that 33 percent of the respondents voiced their
support for Su's reelection bid.</P>
      <P>The poll results released Monday also show that both the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) nominee, Lin Jih-jia, and the tiny
opposition New Party (NP)-recommended Wang Chien-hsien each received
the support of 12 percent of those surveyed, while opposition People
First Party (PFP) candidate Chin Chin-sheng received 5 percent.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 38 percent of Taipei county voters have
not yet decided for whom they will vote in the election scheduled
for December.</P>
      <P>Asked about their party affiliation, 19 percent said they incline
to supporting the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP); 18
percent said they support the PFP; 15 percent said they back the KMT;
4 percent said they are NP supporters; and 44 percent said they have
no evident party preferences.</P>
      <P>A cross-analysis of poll results show that as the PFP just
announced its candidate Thursday, its supporters remain far divided
over their possible support target.</P>
      <P>Only 23 PFP supporters said they would vote for the party's
nominee, Chin Chin-sheng, while 25 percent said they prefer to back
NP-recommended Wang Chien-hsien; 14 percent said they would support
sitting Magistrate Su; 12 percent said they would support the KMT's
Lin; and 26 percent said they have not yet made a decision.</P>
      <P>Among KMT supporters, 34 percent remain undecided; 31 percent
said they support the party's standard-bearer Lin; 18 percent said
they prefer to back the DPP's Su; 15 percent support the NP's Wang;
and only 1 percent gave a thumbs-up to the PFP's Chin.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the poll found that although the number of NP
supporters is limited, they unanimously support Wang. DPP supporters
are also very united, demonstrating almost unanimous support for Su's
reelection bid, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Of those surveyed who have no special party affiliation, 30
percent voiced their support for the sitting magistrate, while none
of the three other hopefuls could secure a support rate of more than
10 percent.</P>
      <P>If the year-end election turns out to be a three-way race among
Su, Lin, and Chin, the survey results show that Su would still enjoy
a large lead over his KMT and PFP competitors. In a three-way race
scenario, 38 percent said they would vote for Su, 17 percent said
they would back Lin and 12 percent said they would cast their ballots
for Chin.</P>
      <P>Even if the three opposition parties could finally field a common
candidate, the poll found that none of the possible standard-bearers
could compete with Su. In this scenario, Wang would be Su's closest
competitor, gaining 30 percent of the vote to Su's 48 percent. In a
race between Su and Lin, Su would grab 45 percent of the vote to
Lin's 26 percent, while in Su-Chin race, the result would be 53
percent to 20 percent in favor of Su.</P>
      <P>The UDN poll also found that 74 percent of the opposition camp
supporters look forward to seeing the three opposition parties
jointly field a common candidate, while only 21 percent said they
hope to see each party nominate its own candidate.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 76 percent of opposition camp supporters gave a
thumbs-up to the proposal that a public opinion poll be held to
decide who should represent the opposition camp in the year-end race
for the Taipei County Government's top post, while 19 percent said
they oppose such a proposal.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bien expressed his
welcome Monday to former President Bill Clinton for his forthcoming

      <P>President Chen is expected to meet with Clinton and exchange
views on politics, administrative management and other issues of
mutual concern, officials from the Presidential Office said.</P>

and to meet with Taiwan youths for a seminar, the daily newspaper
said.</P>
      <P>Currently the youngest retired president of the United States,
Clinton, 55, has been active on the public stage in what is seen to
be an effort to recreate the "second spring" of his political career,
local political observers said.</P>
      <P>His new office located in New York's Harlem District was
inaugurated July 30. On Aug. 3, he officiated at a ceremony in his
home state of Arkansas, unveiling the plan to build the most
expensive "presidential library" in U.S. history.</P>
      <P>His is also currently chairman of the board of the International
AIDS Trust.</P>
      <P>Clinton will be the third former political leader of a major
nation to accept an invitation by the UDN group to tour and lecture
in Taiwan, following similar visits by former British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher and former Soviet Union President Mikhail
Gorbachev.</P>
      <P>After serving five consecutive terms as governor of Arkansas,
Clinton, at the age of 46, beat incumbent President George Bush in
the 1992 U.S. presidential election, giving the Democrats control of
the White House for the first time in 12 years.</P>
      <P>He was re-elected in 1997, making him the first Democrat to be
re-elected as U.S. president in over 50 years.</P>
      <P>During the eight years that Clinton was in office, the United
States' economy reached its highest level of prosperity in 30 years
and recorded the single longest period of uninterrupted growth in the
history of the country.</P>
      <P>In international affairs, Clinton helped shape a new global order
in the post-Cold War era. By January 2001, when Clinton's second-term
came to an end, volatile areas, including the Balkans, Northern
Ireland, the Korean Peninsula, and the Middle East, had all witnessed
successful diplomatic breakthroughs of one form or another following
the "intervention" of Clinton.</P>
      <P>On cross-strait relations, Clinton had tried his utmost to
establish a security framework maintaining stability in the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>He followed an "engagement" policy toward mainland China in the
hope that by conducting "strategic dialogue," the United States could
exert a positive influence on the leadership in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Although he personally spelled out the "Three Nos" statement
concerning cross-strait relations that was not warmly received in
Taiwan, he stressed throughout both his terms in office that "any
formula or model" for resolving cross-strait disputes must first gain
the consent of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The "Three Nos" formulation denotes no support for Taiwan
independence, no support for "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan,"
and no support for Taiwan membership in international organizations
where statehood is required.</P>
      <P>Clinton's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, currently a senator for
New York State, and his only daughter, Chelsea, will not be
accompanying him on his forthcoming visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Clinton will be the third former U.S. president to visit Taiwan
since the Republic of China severed formal diplomatic relations with
the United States in 1979, following visits in the past by Gerald
Ford and Jimmy Carter.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE CHAIR VISITS TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The new chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign
Relations Committee arrived in Taipei Monday for a whirlwind
overnight visit.</P>
      <P>Sen. Joseph Biden (D.-Del.) was greeted at the airport by
Republic of China Vice Foreign Minister Wu Tzu-dan and Raymond
Burghardt, director of the Taipei Office of the American Institute in
Taiwan, which represents U.S. interests in the ROC in the absence of
formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is the first leg of Biden's first overseas trip since he
replaced Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), one of Taiwan's strongest
supporters and a harsh critic of mainland China, as head of the
powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee in early June.</P>
      <P>Biden, heading a delegation of senators from both the Democratic
Party and the Republican Party, will leave Taipei Tuesday morning to
continue his current four-leg visit which will also take him to
mainland China, North Korea and South Korea.</P>
      <P>Biden and other delegation members will exchange views with
senior officials of the four countries on U.S. national
security-related strategic issues.</P>
      <P>Biden is scheduled to meet with President Chen Shui-bian at 4
p.m. and will hold a news conference at the Grand Formosa Regent
Hotel Monday evening. Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao will host a
dinner in honor of Biden and other visiting U.S. senators, including
Sen. Paul Sarbanes, a Maryland Democrat; Sen. Arlen Specter, a
Pennsylvania Republican; and Sen. Fred Thompson, a Tennessee
Republican.</P>
      <P>On the thorny issues between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait,
Biden said prior to his departure for his current East Asian trip
that the "strategic ambiguity" approach adopted by successive U.S.
administrations over the past two decades has actually implied two
clear-cut messages -- Taiwan should not expect U.S. protection if it
moves toward de jure independence and anything may happen if mainland
China uses force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Biden further said U.S. President George W. Bush's previous
remark that the United States would do whatever it can to help defend
Taiwan had gone beyond the U.S. security commitment to Taiwan. The
Senate heavyweight said he does not think that the U.S. government is
likely to issue a similar kind of statement in the future regarding
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>In a recent interview with Reuters, Biden said he was convinced
that peaceful cross-strait integration is the ultimate goal of the
United States and both sides of the Taiwan Strait. In his view, Biden
said, the United States should neither encourage Taiwan independence
nor let mainland China use force or military intimidation to shorten
the process of cross-strait integration.</P>
      <P>This is Biden's first visit to Taiwan since he became a senator
in 1973.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHILD HELPS OPERATE EXCAVATOR IN POST-TYPHOON CLEANUP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hualien, eastern Taiwan, Aug. 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>One can hardly believe that
a child as young as seven years old, an age when most boys are
playing with toy tractors, is actually operating a real excavator
like a handyman in ravaged post-typhoon Hualien County.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ming-chin was operating his father's excavator Sunday in a
riverside area where people are still trying to unearth the bodies of
those who were declared missing and are now believed to be dead,
seven days after Typhoon Toraji swept across the island July 29-30.</P>
      <P>Little Ming-chin and his father Tsai Lai's own home was destroyed
by the devastation wrought by Typhoon Toraji. As of Monday, 99 people
were confirmed killed as a result of the typhoon, while 116 others
were still unaccounted for. Besides the heavy human casualties, some
NT$7.7 billion (US$222.54 million) worth of losses to agriculture was
caused by Toraji.</P>
      <P>Ming-chin, who learned how to drive mechanical diggers before he
could walk, was allowed to operate a real excavator alone by the age
of five.</P>
      <P>Now an "efficient" handyman, Ming-chin has helped his father
carry out cleanup work in the aftermath of the typhoon. "Dad would
allow me to do it when he was too busy to operate one," he said.</P>
      <P>Hualien County and Nantou County were the two areas hardest hit
by Toraji, which wreaked havoc in eastern and central Taiwan with
strong winds and torrential rains that caused devastating floods,
landslides and mudslides that buried people, washed away houses,
destroyed roads and bridges, and ruined fields and plantations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LARGEST-EVER BIOSCIENCE CONFERENCE IN TAIWAN OPENS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  6  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The largest-ever conference in Taiwan on
bioscience opened Monday with more than 1,000 ethnic Chinese
scientists gathered for the five-day meeting.</P>
      <P>The international symposium, with a theme of "Frontiers of
biotechnology and biomedical science in the new millennium," is
jointly sponsored by Academia Sinica, the National Health Research
Institute (NHRI) and the Society of Chinese Bioscientists in America.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian spoke at the opening ceremony at
Academia Sinica, the highest research institute in Taiwan, and
reaffirmed the government's determination to develop bioscience.</P>
      <P>The president said that the government has planned to set up a
bioscience industrial park in Chunan, Miaoli County. The park will be
under the administration of the nearby Hsinchu Science-based
Industrial Park.</P>
      <P>He also expressed the hope that more such conferences will be
held in Taiwan to upgrade bioscientific research and development and
increase international cooperation in the field.</P>
      <P>Ho I-kan, president of the Society of Chinese Bioscientists in
America, said that the society has rallied ethnic Chinese scholars
and experts living in the United States, Canada and other parts of
the world to make the event the largest-ever gathering in Taiwan of
top-notch ethnic Chinese in the biomedical field.</P>
      <P>He said that the conference is especially significant as the
government is actively promoting bioscientific technology to help
further the island's economic transformation.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh said that Taiwan has
excelled in high-tech industries over the past years, but will face
more challenges ahead with the dawning of bioscientific technology.
He expressed the hope that everyone will work harder to meet the
challenges of the future.</P>
      <P>NHRI President Wu Cheng-wen also said that academic research
institutes will play major roles in bioscientific competition in the
new century and his institute plans to target certain biomedical
technologies that Taiwan may be able to enjoy an advantage in, such
as finding the carcinogens of liver cancer and oral cancer common in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Participants in the conference will include Steven Chu, a 1997
Nobel laureate in physics; David Ho, who pioneered a drug cocktail
treatment to combat AIDS; and more than 1,000 bioscientists from the
United States, Canada, Britain, Germany, Switzerland, Spain,
Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chu will give a lecture on Aug. 9 to share his research with
Taiwan people. He will speak on "laser cooling and trapping," -- the
topic that won him the Nobel Prize.</P>
      <P>Participants will deliver over 170 speeches and read 250 papers
over the next few days.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN NOT ENTERING DEFLATIONARY PERIOD: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is backing away from the word
"deflation" even though economic figures indicate that commodity
prices growth has shown month-on-month drops in the past several
months, a government official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Deflation would come about as the result of months of long
downturns in price inflation and reduced demand for imports and
domestic demand for exportable goods, said Chen Chang-hsiung, a
bureau chief with the Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The slide in Taiwan's consumer prices diminished in July while
the total amount of consumption by the private sector has not
noticeably dropped from similar levels of the same month of the
previous year, indicating that it is still too early to say that
deflation is setting in, Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to the latest GDBAS tallies, Taiwan's consumer prices
edged up 0.11 percent in July from the year-earlier level as rises in
tuition costs offset falls in food prices.</P>
      <P>The consumer price index (CPI) was down 0.30 percent to 103.41
from a month earlier largely due to lower prices for clothes and
garments, the GDBAS statistics indicated.</P>
      <P>The July wholesale price index fell 0.22 percent to 97.27 from a
year earlier but was up 0.20 percent month-on-month, according to the
DGBAS tallies.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that unless international oil prices should surge
substantially in the next few months, the rise and fall of the
island's consumer prices will not be the focus of economic issues
this year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, average prices for imports declined in July by 10.20
percent, marking the eighth monthly reduction in a row and the
largest monthly drop since January 1999.</P>
      <P>The July average price for exports also fell, by 9.25 percent,
marking nine consecutive months of decline and the largest since May
1999.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OBSERVERS SEE CROSS-TAIWAN STRAIT STOCK MARKET INTERACTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei, Aug. 6 (CNA): Observers of Taiwan's stock market said
Monday that arbitrageurs were taking advantage of the agio by
operating in the stock markets on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Ting Hsueh-wen, general manager of Apollo Investment Trust, said
that the authorities should be alert to the consequences of heavy
cash flows and interactions of the stock markets in Taipei, Shanghai
and Shengzhen.</P>
      <P>Ting said that Taiwan's foreign exchange deposits in the past
week registered a record high, though the domestic money supply was
declining. Taiwan's foreign exchange market and the stock market have
been closely interrelated and it has been especially obvious during
the past week when stock prices were on the rise in the wake of a New
Taiwan dollar appreciation, he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's stock market has rebounded since late July, with the
weighted index climbing from around 4,000 points in late July to
4,530.68 points on Aug. 3.</P>
      <P>While stock prices in Taiwan were going up, the stock markets in
mainland China were declining. The general index of Shanghai B
shares, for instance, dropped from 207 points on July 18 to 159
points on Aug. 3, down 30 percent.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-lung, an analyst from Capital Securities, said that it
was a logical assumption that capital flows manipulated by
arbitrageurs have caused stock prices to rise and fall on both sides
of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Since the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced on
Feb. 19, 2001 to open B shares of the Shanghai and Shengzhen stock
markets to Chinese investors in two stages, the general index of
Shanghai B shares rose from 80 points at the end of February to 240
points in late May, and the index of Shengzhen B shares from 130
points in late February to 450 points in late May.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the weighted index of the Taiwan Stock Market
has continued to decline since late March from some 5,833.88 points
on March 29 to 4136.39 points on July 25. The market has been
gradually recovering.</P>
      <P>Ting of the Apollo Investment Trust said that the waxing and
waning phenomena happens to Taipei as well as the Shanghai and
Shenzhen stock markets in times of big fluctuations. The "hot money"
flowing between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is growing like a
snowball and its impact on the stock market will continue to grow, he
added.</P>
      <P>The government should pay special attention to the capital flows
in the stock market as well as the foreign exchange market to prevent
a drastic shrinkage of the stock market when the arbitrageurs
withdraw their "hot money," he said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 6 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's semiconductor foundries must shift
from the production of 8-inch wafers to 12-inch wafers to maintain
their competitiveness in the international market, an industrial
official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Shih Yen-hsiang, director-general of the Industrial Development
Bureau, said that after Taiwan's two leading semiconductor foundries
-- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (TSMC) and United
Microelectronics Corp., announced that they were going to concentrate
on 12-inch wafer manufacturing, Macronix International and Winbond
Electronics also decided to invest in 12-inch wafer manufacturing
plants.</P>
      <P>Utility rates of the manufacturers' 8-inch production facilities
have been low in the past months due to the sluggish international
market, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Gloomy market forecasts for upstream manufacturing has caused
business declines for the 48 wafer packaging plants and 37 testing
factories in Taiwan, according to the Industrial Technology Research
Institute (ITRI).</P>
      <P>A ITRI analysis shows that output of the semiconductor industry
around the world in 2001 will decline by 17 percent from last year.
Taiwan's semiconductor sector's production value this year is
estimated to reach NT$616.2 billion, down 13 percent from the total
of NT$714.4 billion last year.</P>
      <P>Accounting for 34 percent of the world market share, Taiwan's
semiconductor packaging and testing factories grossed NT$116.6
billion in production value last year. The ITRI analysis indicates
that the production value of the packaging sector will drop by 11.1
percent from the total of NT$83.3 billion last year, and the testing
sector will drop by 15.5 percent from last year's NT$32.8 billion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RESTRICTIONS ON SECURITIES MARKET TO EASE FURTHER: FINANCE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  6  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Finance Yen Ching-chang said
Monday that in view of Taiwan's impending entry in the World Trade
Organization (WHO), opening the securities and financial markets must
progress rapidly.</P>
      <P>Yen made the remarks at a seminar on the policies of merging
securities brokerages and financing companies, investment trust and
consultant companies Monday.</P>
      <P>Yen said that as of the end of June, Taiwan securities brokerages
and securities companies totaled 168, investment trust and investment
consultant companies totaled 261, and the number of those who have
opened accounts in the stock market totaled 12 million. Turnover on
the Taiwan stock market totaled NT$9,829.4 billion in the six
months, while turnover on the over-the-counter market totaled around
NT$1,453.1 billion during the same period.</P>
      <P>Yen said that he believed the saturation of financial
institutions has resulted in fierce competition among the
institutions, and that he wants to improve the investment climate to
upgrade the competitiveness of Taiwan's financial institutes so that
they can remain strong and compete in the international arena.</P>
      <P>The finance ministry has actively tried several measurers to
promote the reforms of the securities market, Yen said, including a
bid to upgrade the ratio of institutional investors in the securities
market, adding that the number of individual investors in the
securities market now accounts for as much as 82 percent.</P>
      <P>Yen noted that with such a high percentage, the Taiwan securities
market has become volatile and it is necessary that the government do
more to attract additional institutional investors.</P>
      <P>He also spoke of the easing of restrictions on foreign investors
in Taiwan's securities market to facilitate its internationalization.</P>
      <P>He noted that the ceiling allowed for a single foreign
institutional investor to invest in the Taiwan securities market has
been adjusted upwards to US$2 billion from US$1.1 billion. The
restrictions on Taiwan's listed stocks have also been lifted since
this year.</P>
      <P>Yen said that the daily trading hours of the stock market have
been lengthened to four and a half hours from three hours on weekdays
and the stock market is closed on Saturdays in line with the
international standards.</P>
      <P>Yen said that with WTO entry, the urgent task for the government
will be to help securities firms to prepare and cope with overall
changes. He also said that financial institutions must look for their
own directions in the increasingly fierce competitive environment.</P>

that none of the 250 new anti-cancer drugs now being tested and
developed in the international community are related to liver cancer,
one of the top killers in Chinese societies.</P>
      <P>As liver cancer is not prevalent in Western countries, Wu said,
American and European researchers are generally not keen on liver
cancer-related study.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Wu said, the four major Chinese
communities -- Taiwan, mainland China, Hong Kong and Singapore --
should pool their wisdom and resources in doing research in this
field. Nasopharyngeal cancer is also a suitable research subject for
Chinese bioscientists, he added.</P>
      <P>In addition, Wu said the results of genetic and basic medicine
research in Chinese communities should be applied to medical
engineering research for production of competitive medical equipment
and relevant products.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Cheng Yung-chi, an academician of
the Academia Sinica, Taiwan's highest research institute, said the
ongoing seminar is expected to introduce the results of Taiwan's
biotechnology research to the world and provide a forum for exchanges
of research achievements of all Chinese societies.</P>
      <P>"By so doing, we hope to attract foreign investment in relevant
research programs in Taiwan," said Cheng, also a noted traditional
Chinese and herbal medicine researcher at Yale University in the
United States.</P>
      <P>Noting that the 21st century will be a century of "traditional
Chinese medicine," Cheng said herbal medicine should be a priority
research topic for major Chinese societies.</P>
      <P>Cheng said he is convinced that herbal medicine would contribute
to the treatment of hepatitis, diabetes and aging-related diseases as
the ancient Chinese left rich legacies in relevant subjects.</P>
      <P>Cheng suggested that ethnic Chinese bioscientists pool their
energy in studying diseases prevailing or unique in Chinese
societies, including finding out what genomes cause those diseases
and conducting empirical research on herbal treatment developed by
ancient Chinese.</P>
      <P>Cheng said he is studying the effects of using traditional
Chinese herbal medicine to treat the side-effects of chemotherapy. He
said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized the
first-stage of clinical research on the treatment developed by his
research team.</P>
      <P>David Ho, also a U.S.-based Academia Sinica academician, said he
has also launched research programs on using traditional Chinese
herbal medicine to treat AIDS.</P>
      <P>More than 1,000 biotechnology and biomedical scientists from
around the world, including dozens of world-renowned ethnic Chinese
bioscientists, are attending the five-day seminar, co-sponsored by
the Society of Chinese Bioscientists in America, the Academia Sinica
and the NHRI.</P>
      <P>The seminar is the largest of its kind ever held in Taiwan. NHRI
Director Wu said he hopes the seminar will help inspire more local
youths to dedicate themselves to biotechnology and biomedical science
research.</P>
      <P>Wu said Taiwan needs a large number of bioscientists to sustain
its development in bioscience. "Taiwan now has only about 4,000
bioscientists. Such a small work force is not enough to back Taiwan's
bid to play an important role in the global bioscience community," he
noted.</P>
      <P>Wu said he also hopes that the seminar can help boost
international cooperation in relevant research fields.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'MINI THREE LINKS' SEE ANOTHER BREAKTHROUGH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Matsu, Aug. 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The direct "mini three links" saw yet another
breakthrough Monday when a Cambodia-registered freighter shipped a
batch of construction materials directly from mainland China to the
Republic of China's frontline island of Matsu.</P>
      <P>The cargo ship transported construction materials, including
doors, windows and granites, from the southeastern mainland
Chinese port city of Mawei to Matsu with the permission of
governments on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The direct cargo shipment followed a three-day visit to
Matsu last week by a delegation of mainland Chinese officials in
Fujian province where Mawei is located.</P>
      <P>In the first seven months following the ROC's Jan.1 opening of
its two offshore defense outposts of Kinmen and Matsu for direct
trade, mail and shipping links with Fujian's Xiamen and Mawei,
commonly known as the "mini three links," mainland authorities only
allowed a foreign freighter to ship a boat load of gravel from Mawei
to Matsu.</P>
      <P>Matsu officials said Monday's event indicates that all the
5,000-plus products Taiwan has allowed to import can be shipped
directly from Mawei to Matsu, which lies far closer to mainland
China than to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>To their knowledge, the officials said, mainland authorities
have agreed to gradually ease restrictions on direct Matsu-Mawei
cargo shipment.</P>
      <P>The officials also quoted Zhang Qiu, a Chinese Communist Party
official in Mawei who visited Matsu Aug. 2-4 as having said that
the Mawei city government plans to a "Matsu shopping town" to
facilitate cross-strait commercial exchanges.</P>
      <P>"If this program can be realized, two-way cargo shipment between
Matsu and Mawei will make headway, and the ROC government's purpose
of boosting economic development in the two frontline islands by
opening the 'mini three links' can be substantiated," said a Matsu
official.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has cold-shouldered the Taiwan-initiated "mini
three links." It has not yet allowed regular Kinmen-Xiamen and
Matsu-Mawei shipping services and has instead approved such
applications on a case-by-case basis. Although many Kinmen residents
have made direct voyages to Xiamen, the number of mainland
residents making direct sailing to Kinmen or Matsu remain
limited. And direct Kinmen-Xiamen and Matsu-Mawei cargo shipments
have also been rare over the past seven months.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Starting Wednesday, the Republic of China
will grant 14-day landing visas to Hong Kong and Macau citizens who
have ever been to Taiwan or possess valid entry/exit permits, the
Ministry of the Interior (MOI) announced Monday.</P>
      <P>MOI officials said prospective Hong Kong and Macau visitors can
apply for 14-day landing visas upon their arrival at either Chiang
Kai-shek International Airport in northern Taiwan or Kaohsiung
International Airport in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The new measures, however, will not be applied to those who
are working at mainland China's official agencies, MOI officials
said, adding that Hong Kong and Macau residents who have been
convicted of crime, or may threaten Taiwan's national security and
social stability, or had illegally smuggled residents in the two
areas to Taiwan, will also be banned from applying landing visas.</P>
      <P>The new measures are expected to help attract more Hong Kong and
Macau tourists to Taiwan, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Upon learning of the ROC government's announcement, the
Hong Kong government said it welcomes Taiwan's new measures to
facilitate Hong Kong residents' sightseeing trips to the island.</P>
      <P>Official tallies show that ROC nationals made more than 2.8
million visits to Hong Kong and Macau last year, making Taiwan
the second and third largest source of tourists to Hong Kong and
Macau, respectively.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hong Kong and Macau residents also made over 295,000
visits to Taiwan in 2000.</P>
      <P>All of the figures indicate that Hong Kong and Macau play an
important intermediary role in relations and engagement
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kuala  Lumpur, Aug. 6 (CNA)
(By Y.P. Chin and Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Monday
that the Republic of China already declared independence from the
Manchu government in 1911, so it does not need to declare
independence again.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remark in Kuala Lumpur to a group of Malaysian alumni
of Taiwan schools. Ma was on the first leg of a 10-day visit to three
Asian cities - Kuala Lumpur, Seoul and Fukuoka, Japan.</P>
      <P>In response to questions, Ma said the young generation in Taiwan
has been strongly influenced by the ideology of independence, which
has seriously hurt the feelings of overseas Chinese.</P>
      <P>Asked about cross-strait ties, Ma said that as long as Taiwan and
mainland China continue their benign exchanges, unification will come
at an opportune time.</P>
      <P>He added that looking at China's history, the situations of
separation constituted 35 percent, while unification took place 65
percent of the time, and both results were achieved by force.</P>
      <P>Entering the 21th century, Ma said, people of both sides are
enjoying high economic growth and have globalization and democracy in
mind, therefore, exchanges between the two sides, either governmental
or private, will be close, as they have been over the last 20 years.</P>
      <P>He said that although the government has not permitted direct
trade, mail and shipping links with mainland China, people are
already doing them.</P>
      <P>Ma also cited the increasing trade and marriages between the two
sides of the Strait, adding that out of bilateral annual trade worth
US$30 billion, Taiwan has enjoyed a surplus of US$15 billion.</P>
      <P>The mayor noted that with exchanges increasing, there is more
understanding and less difference in the life styles between people
of both sides of the Strait. When the time is ripe, unification will
come. He emphasized that Chinese people have the wisdom to reach that
goal.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Party members of the soon-to-be formed
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) outlined a draft of their party
platform Monday, vowing to "stabilize Taiwan's politics, revive its
economy, cement its democracy and strengthen Taiwan."</P>
      <P>TSU leader and former Minister of the Interior Huang Chu-wen made
the announcement at the party's Taipei headquarters.</P>
      <P>Out of a sense of mission for the country and its people, Huang
said the party has pronounced its four principles and 12 party planks
as a common goal for the people of Taiwan to strive together for the
good of the country.</P>
      <P>He said the TSU supports a new round of constitutional amendments
and advocates a three-power government systems for Taiwan. As Taiwan
has already held direct presidential elections and premiers are
appointed by the president without approval by the legislature, the
current government structure has effectively tilted toward the
presidential system.</P>
      <P>"The dual-leadership system is the worst system and the TSU is in
favor of a presidential system," Huang said.</P>
      <P>As to the question of whether the TSU will field a candidate for
the next presidential election slated for 2004, Huang stressed that
the TSU hopes to inject a new lease on life into Taiwan's politics to
overhaul the country's parliamentary system.</P>
      <P>"The establishment and development of the TSU is aimed at
projecting a new parliamentary structure and the group has no plans
to field any candidate for the next presidential election at
present," he explained.</P>
      <P>Regarding the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's worry that
the formation of the TSU may erode its performance in the December
legislative elections, Huang said that his group will not swallow up
votes of DPP backers.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing that the TSU wishes to help the government stabilize
the political situation through winning seats and forging a majority
with the ruling party in the 225-member Legislative Yuan, Huang said
that "we have the confidence to succeed."</P>
      <P>Huang said that the TSU will hold its establishment ceremony Aug.
12 and will not invite leaders of other political parties to attend
the event. However, he added, former President Lee Teng-hui will take
part in the activity, while President Chen Shui-bian remains
undecided whether or not to attend.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A member of the Control Yuan said
Monday Taiwan prosecutors are working with their Swiss counterparts in
investigating the alleged scandal surrounding Taiwan's purchase of
six warships from France.</P>
      <P>Kang Ning-hsiang, who made a trip to France and Switzerland in
June in a private capacity to collect evidence, said Taiwan law
enforcers have contacted their Switzerland counterparts through his
arrangement.</P>
      <P>Kang said Swiss law enforcers expressed their willingness to work
with Taiwan authorities to investigate the allegations that huge
commissions were paid in connection with Taiwan's purchase of six
Lafayette-class frigates from France in 1991.</P>
      <P>Kang said he conveyed their offer of cooperation to Taiwan's
chief prosecutor, Lu Ren-fa, who is personally in charge of the
investigation.</P>
      <P>As a consequence, Kang said, Taiwan prosecutors contacted Swiss
law enforcers on July 29.</P>
      <P>With the assistance of foreign law enforcers, Kang said, the
probe into the allegations is moving into a new phrase and is being
put on the right track.</P>
      <P>The six frigates, with a price of 16 billion French francs, is at
the center of separate investigations in Taiwan and France.</P>
      <P>Taiwan began looking into the case after the mysterious death of
a navy captain who was responsible for the navy's weapons
procurement. His body was found floating in a harbor in northern
Taiwan in 1993.</P>
      <P>But the focus of the investigation into the captain's death was
shifted away to the alleged kickbacks involved in the deal after
former French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, who approved the sales
in 1991, was investigated over charges that he was bribed into giving
the go-ahead to the sale.</P>
      <P>The allegations mushroomed into a scandal which engulfed many
French senior officials and ROC Navy officers after Dumas was
sentenced to prison in May this year. The bank accounts where alleged
ill-gotten gains are being kept in Switzerland have been frozen since
April.</P>
      <P>Local prosecutors indicted nine navy officers in July on charges
of inflating the warships' price for the benefit of its French
builders, but there is no indication thus far that bribery was
involved.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will not have the problem of
deflation, as the annual growth rate of consumer prices rebounded in
July and the ratio for August is expected to rise as a result of the
effects of Typhoon Toraji, a Central Bank of China (CBC) official
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yeh Jung-chao, director-general of the CBC's Economic Research
Department, said in a regular news conference that the July consumer
price index grew by 0.11 percent year-on-year, with the average
growth rate standing at 0.27 percent for the first seven months of
this year.</P>
      <P>Looking to the future, Yeh predicted that consumer prices in
Taiwan will remain stable due to the fact that business conditions
will remain lackluster, growth in salary increases will slow and
house rentals will not rise.</P>
      <P>As the International Monetary Fund specifically defines that only
continued falls in consumer prices for two years in a row will be
considered as signs of deflation, he said that Taiwan can brush aside
worries of possible deflation because it will not encounter such a
problem.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics has forecast that Taiwan's consumer price index will
increase mildly by 1.21 percent for the whole of 2001, ahead of the
average 0.76 percent forecast by local economic research institutes,

    <HEADLINE>VISITING U.S. SENATOR SAYS NO CHANGE IN U.S. POLICY TOWARD TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  6  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Joseph R. Biden, Jr., chairman of the
powerful U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, said Monday
during a whirlwind visit to Taiwan that there is no change in U.S.
policy toward the island.</P>
      <P>Biden said at a press conference held after he and his
four-member delegation called on Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian that there is "very strong support" in the U.S. Senate --
and the U.S. Congress -- for U.S. commitment to Taiwan in accordance
with the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act (TRA).</P>
      <P>Biden, who was involved in the drafting of the TRA, which governs
U.S. relations with Taiwan after Washington switched diplomatic
recognition to Beijing in 1979, was leading a delegation that
includes Senator Paul Sarbanes, a Democrat from Maryland, Senator
Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican, and Senator Fred Thompson,
a Republican from Tennessee.</P>
      <P>Biden said that he has had long discussions with the U.S. State
Department and the White House, and that he could assure the people
of Taiwan that U.S. President George W. Bush has abided by and will
continue to abide by the TRA as the past several U.S. presidents have
done.</P>
      <P>A liberal Democrat from Delaware who succeeded conservative N.
Carolina Republican Jesse Helms in June, Biden said that Beijing
should not misunderstand U.S. commitment to Taiwan under the TRA, and
neither should Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Prior to arriving in Taiwan, he has said that the United States
should neither encourage Taiwan independence nor allow mainland China
to use force or military intimidation to shorten the process of
cross-Taiwan Strait integration.</P>
      <P>This is Biden's first overseas visit since becoming committee
chairman, and his first visit to Taiwan since he became a senator in
1973.</P>
      <P>At the press conference, he said that he is confident such a
process can be managed in such a way that conflict can be avoided
while a result on the island's future can involve the decision of the
people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Responding to a question on whether he believes Taiwan should be
allowed to take part in a U.S.-directed Theater Missile Defense (TMD)
project, Biden said that it remains to be seen whether Taiwan will be
involved.</P>
      <P>However, with regard to a U.S. National Missile Defense, he said
that it is important to deal with possible missile threats in a
"multi-layered" manner -- through both diplomacy and the fostering of
the ability to defend the United States against such possible
threats.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he added that it is important to put Beijing and
Moscow at ease before moving forward with such a missile defense plan
and to make it clear that any system the United States develops is
not aimed at neutralizing mainland China's nuclear deterrent.</P>
      <P>In pursuing such a system, he continued, it is important to be
careful not to trigger another arms race in the region. That was the
reason that Bush touched base with Russian President Vladimir Putin
regarding the issue during a meeting last month.</P>
      <P>Similarly, he added that it was why U.S. Secretary of State Colin
Powell went to Beijing to determine whether a limited missile defense
could be built in such a way that mainland China would not feel the
threat to respond.</P>
      <P>Biden said that he agrees with a policy of engagement with
Beijing because he believes that it will not be possible for mainland
China to maintain a closed system when it is engaged in economic
relations with the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>He said that either the mainland will no longer be a part of the
global economic community a few years from now, or it will gradually
change because "the more they have to lose, the more they will start
to follow international norms."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Specter, who is a member of the Senate Appropriations
Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, said that the United States wants
to see a peaceful relationship maintained between mainland China and
Taiwan, which he said "requires some delicacy, although the real
action has to come from the parties themselves in terms of their
restraint."</P>
      <P>Sarbanes, another member of Biden's delegation, said that during
the group's meeting with Chen, the senators expressed their
admiration for the development of a vibrant democracy in Taiwan, the
"evolution" that has taken place on the island and the role that Chen
has played to make that possible.</P>
      <P>Sarbanes, who is currently chairman of the Senate Committee on
Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, was also involved in the drafting
of the TRA.</P>
      <P>Biden's delegation is scheduled to visit mainland China and South
Korea upon leaving Taiwan Tuesday morning.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW VISA MEASURE EXPECTED TO LURE 100,000 MORE H.K.,MACAU VISITORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 6 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A new visa measure by Taiwan is expected to
attract 100,000 more travelers from Hong Kong and Macau to visit the
island annually, tourism officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior announced earlier in the day that
those residents from Hong Kong and Macau who have visited Taiwan
before or who already hold a valid visa can obtain a 14-day landing
visa upon arrival, effective Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Officials of the Bureau of Immigration predicted that the new
measure will help Taiwan attract 100,000 more Hong Kong and Macau
visitors per year and bring the number of visitors to more than
360,000.</P>
      <P>Vice Interior Minister Lee Yi-yang said that opening the local
tourist market for Hong Kong and Macau visitors is chiefly aimed at
promoting exchanges and cooperation between Hong Kong, Macau and
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ho Jung-tsun, director of the Administrative Department of the
Bureau of Immigration, pointed out that Hong Kong and Macau residents
could originally obtain a Taiwan visa in three ways -- a single
30-day visa, a 12-entry-per-year multiple entry visa valid for 14
days' stay on each issuance and a three-year visa valid for a total
of 12 entries.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the new measure will cause an exodus from mainland
China, Ho said that he did not worry about that because mainland
Chinese living in Hong Kong or Macau must wait at least seven years
before getting a Hong Kong or Macau identification card.</P>
      <P>At the same time, any visitor taking advantage of the landing
visa for the first time will still have to present a entry
permit, Ho said.</P>
      <P>Ho said landing visa applicants should present an application
form, a recent photo and a 14-day round trip air ticket, while those
who already hold a visa need simply present their passport along with
their air ticket.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING BLOCKING TAIWAN'S TOURISM-OPENING BID: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  6  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing has been blocking Taiwan's bid to
open its tourist market to visitors from mainland China, President
Chen Shui-bian said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the accusation while meeting a high-profile U.S.
parliamentary delegation led by Senator Joseph Biden (D.-Del.),
chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, at the
Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The president said that the Republic of China government has
readied itself to play host to tourists from the mainland and has
expressed to the Beijing authorities through various channels its
desire for talks on the issue.</P>
      <P>However, he continued that to the disappointment of Taipei,
Beijing has been unwilling to negotiate with Taipei on the matter and
has even asked Taiwan not to unilaterally announce the policy, which
is aimed at increasing cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks answered the question raised by many in the
tourist trade as to why Taiwan postponed its tourist opening to
mainland people. The Executive Yuan had originally planned to
commence the new measure July 1.</P>
      <P>"We are willing to wait, but the new measures may never be
realized if Beijing refuses to talk," Chen admitted.</P>
      <P>Saying he is determined to improve cross-strait relations and has
on various occasions made clear his determination in this regard,
Chen noted that the development of Taiwan-mainland ties over the past
one year has been unsatisfactory. "The ball is definitely in
Beijing's court now," the president added.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Taiwan's opening of the "mini three links" between
its frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu and selected mainland ports
earlier this year was supposed to be just a first step toward full
trade, postal and transportation links between Taiwan proper and the
mainland.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, it is a pity that the "mini three links"
policy has not proceeded smoothly due to Beijing's refusal to go to
the negotiating table to work out necessary matching measures with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed the hope that the leaders of both Taiwan and the
mainland will "shake hands and embrace each other someday to jointly
make the greatest sacrifice and contribution for the common welfare
of the people of both sides."</P>
      <P>Saying that it would be best for both Taipei and Beijing to
shelve their disputes at the moment, Chen urged the Beijing
leadership to "better understand Taiwan and himself."</P>
      <P>He stressed that Taiwan's procurement of arms from the United
States is purely for national defense and that the island will
neither provoke nor engage in an arms race with mainland China.</P>
      <P>He claimed that Taiwan is willing to cooperate with the United
States to make the Asia-Pacific area a freer, more democratic and
prosperous regional community.</P>
      <P>Biden echoed Chen's view and added that his visit demonstrates
the U.S. Congress' firm support for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Biden and his delegation will leave for the mainland Tuesday to
continue their East Asian trip and Chen said he hoped that the trip
will help them find out the root causes of the current cross-strait
stalemate. They arrived in Taipei Monday for an overnight stay.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is the first leg of Biden's first overseas trip since he
replaced Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) -- one of Taiwan's staunch
supporters and a harsh critic of mainland China -- as head of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee in June. After their mainland
trip, Biden and his delegation will also visit South Korea.</P>
      <P>Members of the delegation also include Sen. Paul Sarbanes
(D.-Md.), Sen. Fred Thompson (R.-Tn.) and Sen. Arlen Specter (R.-Pa.)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The new chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign
Relations Committee arrived in Taipei Monday for a whirlwind
overnight visit.</P>
      <P>Sen. Joseph Biden (D.-Del.) was greeted at the airport by
Republic of China Vice Foreign Minister Wu Tzu-dan and Raymond
Burghardt, director of the Taipei Office of the American Institute in
Taiwan, which represents U.S. interests in the ROC in the absence of
formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is the first leg of Biden's first overseas trip since he
replaced Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), one of Taiwan's strongest
supporters and a harsh critic of mainland China, as head of the
powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee in early June.</P>
      <P>Biden, heading a delegation of senators from both the Democratic
Party and the Republican Party, will leave Taipei Tuesday morning to
continue his current three-leg visit which will also take him to
mainland China and South Korea.</P>
      <P>Biden and other delegation members will exchange views with
senior officials of the four countries on U.S. national
security-related strategic issues.</P>
      <P>Biden is scheduled to meet with President Chen Shui-bian at 4
p.m. and will hold a news conference at the Grand Formosa Regent
Hotel Monday evening. Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao will host a
dinner in honor of Biden and other visiting U.S. senators, including
Sen. Paul Sarbanes, a Maryland Democrat; Sen. Arlen Specter, a
Pennsylvania Republican; and Sen. Fred Thompson, a Tennessee
Republican.</P>
      <P>On the thorny issues between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait,
Biden said prior to his departure for his current East Asian trip
that the "strategic ambiguity" approach adopted by successive U.S.
administrations over the past two decades has actually implied two
clear-cut messages -- Taiwan should not expect U.S. protection if it
moves toward de jure independence and anything may happen if mainland
China uses force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Biden further said U.S. President George W. Bush's previous
remark that the United States would do whatever it can to help defend
Taiwan had gone beyond the U.S. security commitment to Taiwan. The
Senate heavyweight said he does not think that the U.S. government is
likely to issue a similar kind of statement in the future regarding
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>In a recent interview with Reuters, Biden said he was convinced
that peaceful cross-strait integration is the ultimate goal of the
United States and both sides of the Taiwan Strait. In his view, Biden
said, the United States should neither encourage Taiwan independence
nor let mainland China use force or military intimidation to shorten
the process of cross-strait integration.</P>
      <P>This is Biden's first visit to Taiwan since he became a senator
in 1973.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   6  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lee Wen-hwa and Eva Y. Lee -- a
husband-and-wife team of Chinese American scientists -- are scheduled
to present the results of their study on tumor suppressing genes at
an ongoing seminar on biotechnology and biomedical science in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Lee Wen-hwa, chairman of the Department of Molecular Medicine at
the Health Science Center of the University of Texas, and his wife Eva
Y. Lee, a professor at the same department, were given the Society of
Chinese Bioscientists in America (SCBA) Presidential Award for their
research on tumor suppressor genes and genome integrity in cancer
progression.</P>
      <P>In 1986, they discovered the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene
(RB), making them the first scientists in the world to discover such
suppressor genes.</P>
      <P>According to their research, inactivation of tumor suppressor
genes frequently leads to tumor formation. These genes might
participate in DNA synthesis, repair, cell cycle checkpoint control
and chromosome segregation to increase their fidelity in order to
maintain genome integrity.</P>
      <P>They said that if scientists could find out how these genes work,
then not only might it be possible to prevent cancer, but it might be
possible to save late-stage patients.</P>
      <P>Lee Wen-hwa is also slated to present a paper on breast cancer
susceptibility genes and DNA repair on Friday.</P>
      <P>They are only two out of more than 1,000 scientists from around
the world who are attending the five-day seminar, which is jointly
sponsored by the SCBA, Academia Sinica and the National Health
Research Institute.</P>
      <P>Participants in the conference include Steve Chu, a 1997 Nobel
laureate in physics; David Ho, who pioneered a drug cocktail
treatment to combat AIDS -- for which he was named Time magazine's
Man of the Year in 1996; and bioscientists from the United States,
Canada, Britain, Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Australia, Japan, Hong
Kong, Singapore and mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIST: NO SIGN OF TAIWAN INDUSTRY HOLLOW-OUT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  6  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's current economic slowdown is a
temporary phase in economic circles and there is no sign of the
feared "industry hollow-out", according to Taiwan's two major
economic indicators, a government economist said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lee Kao-chao, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development, said that neither Taiwan's
industrial production index nor its labor productivity has showed any
sign of "industry hollow-out" or economic recession.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy, which has plunged to its economic nadir for the
time being, might have suffered somehow because of the island's
current unfavorable political situation and its chilled ties with
mainland China, but it is a far cry from recession or "a
hollowing-out," he said.</P>
      <P>"Recession" or "hollowing-out" means the long-term decline of
productivity, such as the island experienced in 1990 when Taiwan's
industrial production dipped by 0.2 percent, Lee explained.</P>
      <P>But Taiwan's industrial production has enjoyed growth of between
6 percent and 7 percent since 1994, he went on.</P>
      <P>The island's overall productivity grew at an average of 0.4
percent or 0.5 percent in the last few years, while labor
productivity grew by 7 percent on average in the same period, except
for 4.4 percent recorded in 1997, when the region was savaged by a
financial crisis, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Although the economist declared the alleged recession is none of
his concern, he said he did worry about the island's low-technology
industry, which is being edged out of the market by the world's many
newcomers to the capitalist economy.</P>
      <P>Saying that many places, such as India, mainland China, Russia,
Eastern Europe and Vietnam, which have a combined population of 2.6
billion, began to embrace the capitalist economy after the end of the
cold war, Lee continued that Taiwan's low-technology industry is
losing ground to their counterparts in these places because of the
island's higher labor costs, which are up to ten times those in the
places mentioned.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's high-technology industry, which has been closely
integrated into the world economy, will recover quickly as long as
the worldwide economy emerges from the doldrums, Lee said.</P>
      <P>He made the statement at a symposium organized by the Taiwan
Research Institute on Taiwan's economic recession and industry
hollow-out.</P>
      <P>Also present at the seminar were Day sheng-tong, president of the
the Association of Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises, and Wei Duan,
former director-general of the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics under the Executive Yuan.</P>

paper to customs July 6 for permission to bring in a box of
semi-finished precious stones weighing 116 kilograms.</P>
      <P>Customs officials said that some necklaces and pipes made of
ivory-like materials were discovered in the box and added that these
items had been forwarded to the Council of Agriculture and the
Investigation Bureau for further examination.</P>
      <P>They said that the Zambian visitor was allowed to enter the
country after leaving his contact address with the customs.</P>
      <P>The MOFA official said that the news report was obviously
incorrect, as Zambia is not a diplomatic ally of the ROC and that the
government has received no request for examination of the case from
either the customs or any foreign diplomatic mission in Taipei.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The fact that Taiwan was the world's fourth
hardest-hit area by the computer virus "Code Red" should press home
to local computer maintenance technicians the importance of updating
their computer systems, a local anti-virus expert said Monday.</P>
      <P>More than 15,000 host computers in Taiwan fell prey to the "Code
Red" which made its way into computer systems worldwide late last
month, according to statistics compiled by local analysts.</P>
      <P>Although the figure is far less than the 150,000 computers
affected by the bug in the United States, and makes up only 4 percent
of the 360,000 computers targeted for attack by the virus, it is
still alarming that so many systems on the island could be hit by a
virus in such a short period, the analyst said.</P>
      <P>About 70,000 websites with the ".tw" suffix -- which refers to
Taiwan -- were infected with the virus and forced to close for
repair, which makes the island the fifth hardest-hit area in world in
terms of affected websites, said the analyst.</P>
      <P>The vulnerability of the host computers was due especially to the
laxity of local IT technicians in updating their systems, according
to the analyst.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, the attack by "Code Red" has now alarmed
these maintainers into plugging the holes in their systems to prevent
a recurrence of the infection.</P>

(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairman of the powerful U.S. Senate
Committee on Foreign Relations concluded his 24-hour whirlwind visit
to Taiwan Tuesday and headed for Shanghai, the second stop on his
three-leg trip to East Asia.</P>
      <P>Leading a four-member bipartisan congressional delegation, Sen.
Joseph R. Biden Jr. called on Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian and Minister of Foreign Affairs Tien Hung-mao while in
Taipei to exchange views on ROC-U.S. bilateral relations and
cross-Taiwan Strait security.</P>
      <P>A liberal Democrat from Delaware who succeeded conservative North
Carolina Republican Jesse Helms in June as committee chairman, Biden
reaffirmed that there has been no change in the U.S. commitment to
the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which has governed U.S. policy toward
Taiwan since Washington switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei
to Beijing that same year.</P>
      <P>This is Biden's first overseas visit since becoming chairman and
his first visit to Taiwan since he became a senator in 1973.</P>
      <P>In Shanghai, his delegation is slated to call on the mayor of
Shanghai and meet with mainland Chinese graduate students and
professors at Fudan University -- known as "China's Stanford" -- to
review political and economic liberalization policies, mainland
China's impending World Trade Organization accession and its
implications.</P>
      <P>Biden is also scheduled to call on the top leadership in Beijing,
including mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Premier Zhu Rongji,
Defense Minister Chi Haotian and Foreign Minister Tang Jianhui.</P>
      <P>His congressional delegation -- which includes Sen. Paul
Sarbanes, a Democrat from Maryland, Sen. Arlen Specter, a
Pennsylvania Republican, and Sen. Fred Thompson, a Republican from
Tennessee -- will also visit Seoul and call on South Korean President
Kim Dae-jung.</P>
      <P>Local reports said that Tom DeLay, the majority whip in the U.S.
House of Representatives, and Henry Hyde, chairman of the House
Committee on International Relations, are slated to visit Taiwan
later this month.</P>
      <P>Former U.S. President Bill Clinton is also reportedly scheduled
to visit Taiwan in September at the invitation of a local newspaper.</P>

(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Foreign Affairs Minister
Tien Hung-mao said Tuesday that U.S. Sen. Joseph Biden's whirlwind
visit to Taiwan had "major political significance" in light of the
powerful senator's decision to make the island the first stop on his
trip to East Asia.</P>
      <P>Tien said that Biden, a liberal Democrat from Delaware who
succeeded conservative North Carolina Republican Jesse Helms in June
as chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, has
once sought the Democratic presidential nomination and has
"considerable weight" in politics.</P>
      <P>Biden's decision to visit Taipei before traveling on to Shanghai
and Beijing runs against what many politicians or scholars do when
they visit East Asia, showing that he has a "relative degree of
acceptance and recognition" of Taiwan, Tien added.</P>
      <P>Tien quoted Biden as saying at a dinner banquet hosted in the
senator's honor the previous evening that although his visiting
congressional delegation is made up of both Democrats and Republicans
who often differ in their opinions on various issues and their
attitude toward mainland China, their support for Taiwan is
unanimous.</P>
      <P>Biden's delegation, which includes Sen. Paul Sarbanes, a Democrat
from Maryland, Sen. Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican, and
Sen. Fred Thompson, a Republican from Tennessee, arrived in Taipei
Monday and departed for Shanghai Tuesday morning.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOCALLY DEVELOPED SATELLITE TO BE LAUNCHED NEXT MAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A locally designed and built picosatellite
is scheduled to be launched into orbit in May next year, the National
Space Program Office (NSPO) under the National Science Council (NSC)
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The launching of YAMSAT will usher in a new era of "do it
yourself" in the Republic of China's space technology development,
NSPO Director Lee Lo-chuan said.</P>
      <P>YAMSAT will be designed and developed by a team of young local
engineers, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>"They have completed the designing and planning work and will
join forces with the domestic academic and industrial communities in
producing a spacecraft bus, on-board computer, antenna, solar array
and scientific payload for the satellite," Lee said, adding that the
team will also build a ground station to receive information.</P>
      <P>Only a few kinds of integrated circuit (IC) components will be
purchased from abroad for the project, and the rocket to put YAMSAT
into orbit will be ordered from Russia with the assistance of
Stanford University of the United States, Lee said.</P>
      <P>"As this will be the first time that local space technology
experts and engineers jointly develop and manufacture a satellite,
the event is of great significance to Taiwan's space technology
development regardless of whether the program succeeds or not," Lee
explained.</P>
      <P>He added that the Cabinet-level NSC has agreed to earmark NT$10
million (US$289,855) to finance the YAMSAT project.</P>
      <P>Lin Hsin-chia, director of the project, said the square-shaped,
pico-class YAMSAT will weigh only one kilogram. "It will be launched
into orbit at an altitude of 600 kilometers, with a mission life of
one month and a design life of two months," he noted.</P>
      <P>The picosatellite will be launched by a Russian-made DNEPR rocket
in May 2001, Lin said, adding that YAMSAT will be equipped with a
locally developed micro-spectrometer to conduct atmosphere elements
analysis.</P>
      <P>Lin said his team will endeavor to complete development and
construction of YAMSAT before the end of this year to ensure its
smooth launch on schedule.</P>
      <P>The ROC launched a 15-year space technology development program
in 1991. Under the plan, Taiwan launched its first satellite,
ROCSAT-I, produced by TRW Co. of the United States, in January 1999
for the Ka-band experimental communications payload and ionospheric
plasma electrodynamics study.</P>
      <P>The ROC has also commissioned the French firm Matra Co. and
U.S.-based Orbital Science Corp. to produce its second and third
satellites, respectively.</P>
      <P>ROCSAT-2 is a smaller satellite designed for remote sensing and
contains an electron-optical imager and a Sprite imager to carry out
its tasks. In addition to its remote sensing mission, ROCSAT-2 also
has the scientific mission of investigating various lightning
phenomena in the upper atmosphere.</P>
      <P>The ROCSAT-3 program is aimed at developing a constellation of
eight low-orbit satellites for operational weather forecasting, space
weather monitoring and climate research.</P>

      <P>Minister of National Defense Wu Shih-wen
traveled to eastern Taiwan's Hualien County Tuesday for his latest
round of inspections of the typhoon-battered disaster area.</P>
      <P>Expressing the military's determination to assist local
governments in their reconstruction efforts, he said that the
soldiers sent to the various hardest-hit areas to support disaster
relief operations will "stay to the last moment."</P>
      <P>As of Tuesday afternoon, 100 people had been confirmed killed by
the devastation wrought by Typhoon Toraji, which struck the island
last Monday. In addition, 189 people were injured as a result of the
typhoon, while another 114 are still missing.</P>
      <P>Military spokesman Maj. Gen. Huang Suey-sheng said at a routine
press conference that although disaster relief work is not the armed
forces' basic mission or specialty, the military will treat relief
operations as if they were military operations and will not stand
idly by and watch fellow citizens suffer.</P>
      <P>However, he added that his ministry must point out that the
nation already has various levels of disaster contingency centers
under the administrative system and that the military is only playing
a supporting role in the disaster relief work.</P>
      <P>Whenever the military receives instructions from these disaster
contingency centers, he continued, the armed forces will move out and
execute their orders in the shortest amount of time to provide
relief.</P>
      <P>Huang said that various companies that supply goods for the
military's General Welfare Service Ministry -- the commissary goods
administration -- have donated food, drinks, work gloves and other
products for residents in the disaster areas and for the soldiers who
are working to help those residents.</P>
      <P>The first batch of such relief goods reached the counties of
Nantou and Hualien on Monday, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei City Government Spokesman Wu Yu-sheng said that
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who is currently visiting Malaysia, has
given instructions by phone that the city government provide full
support for the reconstruction efforts in the disaster areas.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the city has already sent rescue and relief
personnel to the disaster regions and has agreed to help Hualien
County's Kuangfu Rural Township with reconstruction projects and
counseling for the area's elementary school students.</P>

      <P>Lin made the remarks during discussions on rising unemployment in

      <P>Lin said that it is the social responsibility of businesses to
take care of workers, but because the current economy is in the
doldrums, businesses should first take care of themselves -- a step
that will ultimately help workers.</P>
      <P>Management and labor should not view each other as adversaries,
Lin said; rather, they should understand that they are "in the same
boat" and should work together to keep the ship afloat.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the boat is currently too heavy and needs to be
streamlined, adding that everyone should adopt the attitude that
businesses must continue to develop and that businesses must" save
themselves to save the jobless."</P>

system, and that Taiwan's minimum wage, which currently stands at
NT$15,840 (US$357), is not necessarily beneficial to laborers.</P>

      <P>While dotcoms around the world are trying to
find profit-making business models, Taiwan's Internet service
providers (ISP) and Internet content providers (ICP) are looking into
ways to charge users for their services, according to a survey
conducted by Openfind Information Technology Inc.</P>
      <P>The survey also shows that a considerable number of users are
willing to pay in order to get better service.</P>
      <P>Thirty-four percent of those polled are willing to pay for the
information and services they receive from ICPs or ISPs. Based on the
survey results, Openfind has decided to charge members of its "Cyber
Information Agent," an Internet search engine, for information or
services they offer.</P>
      <P>In the past year, quite a few of Taiwan's Internet portal sites
succumbed to the cold winter for Internet business when their
profit-making models based on cyber advertisement income were found
to be virtually worthless. The concept of offering "free content" and
"free services" has made dotcoms "money burning" companies without
revenues.</P>
      <P>Leading ICPs and ISPs in Taiwan are studying ways to have their
users pay for the services. Seednet, Taiwan's largest ISP, for

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei, Aug. 7 (CNA): The Ministry of Education has announced
that working adults with four years of job experience and qualified
language and mathematics abilities will be offered opportunities to
attend universities or colleges.</P>
      <P>The ministry has recently drafted a white paper stating its new
policies for higher education. The working adult undergraduate
educational program is a key point of the mid-term targets. Working
adults over 25 years old are entitled to attend the program.</P>
      <P>To promote internationalization in higher education, the ministry
is encouraging local universities to cooperate in forming
international academies for foreign students wishing to study in
Taiwan in courses other than the Chinese language or culture. The
proposed academies can offer such courses as business management in
Chinese communities and computer science as well as information
technologies. All courses will be conducted in English.</P>
      <P>After making a thorough review of the practices of higher
education, the ministry has drafted plans for future developments
regarding proper distribution of educational resources, personnel
training and international competitiveness, as well as adult
education.</P>
      <P>The ministry hopes that the new policies will provide greater
flexibility to the universities and colleges and better opportunities
for those wishing to study.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. LAWYER DONATES COMIC BOOKS ON TAIWAN HISTORY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An American lawyer, Robin Winkler, donated
600 sets of a 10-volume prize-winning comic collection featuring
Taiwan's history to the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC) Tuesday to express his love for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Winkler presented the comic book collections to MOTC Minister Yeh
Chu-lan in a brief ceremony held at the ministry. Winkler told Yeh
that he has lived in Taiwan for 20 years and has married a Taiwan
woman. "And I have come to perceive myself as a Taiwan folk," he
added.</P>
      <P>Winkler said he has found that many local people do not truly
understand Taiwan. "Because of my love for Taiwan, I hope more people
can gain a correct and clear understanding of Taiwan through this
prize-winning comic collection," he explained.</P>
      <P>The collection, which won the Golden Tripod Award presented by
the Government Information Office last year, was compiled and created
by more than 10 historians and a number of professional script
writers and cartoonists.</P>
      <P>MOTC Minister Yeh said she herself has bought a collection of the
book. To her knowledge, Yeh said the production crew spent more than
three years creating the 10-volume collection from a localized angle.
"Although the themes and subjects were serious, the collection was
presented in an animated comic style to attract readers," Yeh noted.</P>
      <P>The minister further said the collection gives a detailed,
comprehensive description of Taiwan's history and cultural
development.</P>
      <P>"Through the collection, we can understand that Taiwan has a
rich, diverse cultural heritage which integrates legacies of
Aborigines, Hakkas and immigrants from mainland China," Yeh said,
adding that the collection caters to the tastes of both young and old
readers.</P>
      <P>Yeh said Winkler's donated comic collections will be presented to
local travel associations and domestic and foreign airlines for free
distribution to interested readers at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Chen Ming-tung, vice chairman of
the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, said the collection
introduces Taiwan's various aspects from an international viewpoint.</P>
      <P>Chen said mainland Chinese leaders tend to regard Taiwan as a
territory under the PRC. "In reality, Taiwan has developed its own
culture and social system over the past centuries," Chen said, adding
that the current political entity in Taiwan is the product of
concerted efforts of generations of residents on the island.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The offshore outpost of Kinmen will soon
take several measures to prevent rabies from the mainland from making
inroads into the island with the opening of the "mini three links"
with the mainland since the beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen Animal and Plant Quarantine and Prevention institute
said that rabies is a high risk contagious disease that can affect
humans and animals alike.</P>
      <P>The institute noted that the mainland is a rabies infected area,
and that cases of people dying from the disease are reported every
year. With the direct trade, postal and transportation links between
Kinmen and Matsu with the mainland, cross-strait exchanges of people,
ships and goods have increased rapidly, and the risk of rabies
landing on Kinmen has also increased, the institute added.</P>
      <P>The institute said that it will start to take several measures at
the end of the month.</P>
      <P>The measures will include free sterilization and chip
implantation of cats and dogs as well as inoculations against
rabies.</P>
      <P>Pet owners will also have to register their pets or face a fine
of up to NT$20,000 (US$578), the institute said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC MEDIA HEADS HOPE EXCHANGES WILL HELP REVIVE STALLED CROSS-STRAIT TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  Aug.  7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chairman Shaw Yu-ming of Taiwan's Central
Daily News said Tuesday in Beijing that he is not optimistic about
cross-strait relations, but he hopes increased media exchanges
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will help redress the
situation.</P>
      <P>Shaw and other media heads of Taiwan media, who arrived in
Beijing Monday, also called on the People's Daily and met with Chen
Siwei, vice chairman of the National People's Congress Standing
Committee, and Chen Yunlin, director of the Central Office for Taiwan
Affairs Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The former director general of the ROC's Government Information
Office noted that the previous Kuomintang administration introduced
the "no haste, be patient" policy toward investing in the mainland.</P>
      <P>But at that time, Taiwan's economy was in good shape and the
country could afford to have no trade exchanges with the mainland,
but with the inauguration of the new administration and the exodus of
businesses from Taiwan, the island's economy has gone from bad to
worse, he added.</P>
      <P>Shaw lamented that the administration of President Chen Shui-bian
has not recognized the 1992 consensus on "one China, separate
interpretations." This, Shao said, is causing the problems in
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>But as all countries come in droves to the mainland, and the
expected impact after mainland China joins the WTO, Shaw said that
Taiwan is bound to have to open direct trade, postal and
transportation links, commonly known as the "three links," with the
mainland to create mutually beneficial cross-strait relations, adding
that a stalled cross-strait relationship will not help Taiwan's
economy.</P>
      <P>Shaw said that the KMT has, therefore, advocated the "one China,
separate interpretations," resumption of dialogue on the
implementation of the "three links," and the signing of a peace
agreement in Taiwan so that relation between the two sides can
progress toward stability.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
launched a language and professional training program Tuesday for 37
conscripts who will soon be sent abroad for alternative diplomatic
service.</P>
      <P>They will be the first batch of Taiwan conscripts to join the
diplomatic service as an alternative to compulsory military service.</P>
      <P>The 37 bachelor's and master's degree holders have received four
weeks of basic military training at the Chengkungling army training
center in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Over the next 10 weeks, they will receive language and
professional training in preparation for work with the Republic of
China's agricultural, fishery and medical missions stationed in
various countries that maintain formal diplomatic ties with the ROC.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a ceremony marking the opening of the training
program, Minister of Foreign Affairs Tien Hung-mao encouraged the
young conscripts to dedicate themselves to fulfilling their duties
and helping promote friendship with the ROC's diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>In addition to language and professional training, MOFA officials
said the courses will also include psychological and cultural
adaptation, life management, first-aid training, health and disease
prevention to help the young conscripts adapt themselves to life in
remote foreign countries.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials said 17 of the 37 conscripts are master's degree
holders and that many of the others are graduates of medical schools.
They added that a total of 211 conscripts had applied for alternative
diplomatic service.</P>
      <P>The ROC began to implement an alternative military service system
last year, making it the first Asian country to introduce such a
system. Thousands of conscripts qualified for alternative service
have been assigned to work as school guards and firefighters or to
join other social services, including reconstruction in disaster
zones hard-hit by a devastating earthquake that rattled Taiwan Sept.

    <HEADLINE>13-YEAR-OLD ADMITTED AS YOUNGEST UNIVERSITY FRESHMAN IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A 13-year-old prodigy student from southern
Taiwan passed the Joint University Entrance Examinations (JUEE) with
flying colors recently, allowing him to enter his top choice, the
Electrical Engineering Department of National Taiwan University
(NTU), this fall.</P>
      <P>Thirteen-year-old Lin Chien-yi, who graduated from the National
Tainan First Senior High school in southern Taiwan as the youngest
graduate of the prestigious high school, became the youngest
university freshman in Taiwan in the island's 48-year history of the
highly competitive joint university entrance examinations.</P>
      <P>JUEE authorities made public Tuesday the results of the national
examinations -- the last one to be held as the examination system to
determine university placement has been discontinued.</P>
      <P>Unveiling the list of successful candidates in front of the gates
of National Taiwan University, Minister of Education Ovid Tzeng urged
all university freshmen-to-be to prepare themselves during the summer
break to allow them to have a pleasant and confident start in their
new college life.</P>
      <P>Tzeng also exhorted those who were not admitted to universities
to use "more diversified thinking" about their future, saying that
some people are talented in non-academic fields and not all people
are supposed to enter college or university as the only way to
achieve their goals in life.</P>
      <P>Since this is the final JUEE in Taiwan, many students who took
the JUEE in early July and have been looking forward to entering
departments and schools of their choice, were accompanied by their
parents to check out the name list which was posted at National
Taiwan University Tuesday. Many took photographs of the historic last
test results.</P>
      <P>The JUEE has long been considered a flawed system by educators
and called a nightmare by high school students in Taiwan. Minister
Tzeng said during his inspection tour of the tests in early July that
even though the examinations themselves were fair, their existence
had side-tracked the real emphasis of learning for high school
students into studying only to pass exams.</P>
      <P>Tzeng said he is looking forward to the new university entrance
program which will give students more options and hold them
responsible for their decisions.</P>
      <P>According to the JUEE authorities, a total of 77,450 high school
graduates out of the 120,143 students who took the battery JUEE tests
this year were admitted, marking a record high 64.46 percent success
rate in the system's 48-year history.</P>
      <P>National Taiwan University's Department of Law, Department of
Electrical Engineering, Department of Medicine and Department of
Entomology remained the top choices in four different fields of
studies by Taiwanese youths.</P>
      <P>Some things were different this year, however, including the
13-year-old prodigy and that 10 mentally and physically-challenged
students were admitted, many to their first choices. Sixteen inmates
also passed the exams.</P>
      <P>According to JUEE authorities, a total of 25 inmates took part in
the joint examinations this year. Two of those who passed plan on
entering National Taiwan University to study in the Department of
Social Studies. Twelve are from Hualien Prison.</P>

Taiwan men and now reside in Taipei embarked on a rare tour of Taipei

    <HEADLINE>SENATOR'S VISIT NOT TO CHANGE CROSS-STRAIT TIES: SCHOLARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  7 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The visit to Taiwan by the head of the U.
S. Senate's Foreign Relations Committee, Joseph Biden, is not
expected to help improve relations between Taiwan and mainland China,
scholars who attended a seminar said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Stephen Chen, former Republic of China representative to the
United States and currently a panel director of the
Kuomintang-sponsored National Policy Foundation, said Taiwan-mainland
ties will not change or improve despite Biden's recent visit.</P>
      <P>As the positioning of Taiwan's national status is of a pivotal
role to cross-strait relations, Chen said the government must first
position Taiwan's national status before being able to seek a
progress in bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Chen also criticized President Chen Shui-bian for urging Biden to
push the United States to serve as a promoter of cross-strait
relations though it is reluctant to play the role of mediator in this
regard. According to Chen, such a call is tantamount to asking the
United States go against its "six assurances" for Taipei and make
the Taiwan Relations Act an empty shell.</P>
      <P>Traveling at the head of a four-member congressional delegation,
Biden arrived in Taiwan Monday and headed for Shanghai Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Biden's remarks during his brief visit to
Taiwan have been consistent. He stressed that the United States will
back Taiwan, but not Taiwan independence, and called for cross-strait
dialogue to peacefully settle bilateral disputes.</P>
      <P>Wei Ai, director of the East Asian Study Center under National
Chengchi University, also contended that Biden's visit to Taiwan will
not be helpful to cross-strait ties because analyzing the matter from
a long-term perspective, Washington will not make big changes in its
policy toward the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the United States will continue its engagement
with mainland China and stick to its "one China" policy and the three
communiques signed by Washington and Beijing to maintain peace across
the Strait.</P>
      <P>Teng Chung-chien, director of National Chengchi University's
Diplomatic Department, said the United States will not support Taiwan
independence nor will it allow mainland China to launch military
attacks against Taiwan, judging from the basic tone of its "one
China" policy, which advocates cross-strait dialogue and peaceful
settlements.</P>
      <P>In the current post-Cold War era, when economic benefits are the
major concern of countries across the world, it is worth in-depth
study whether or not the United States will continue backing Taiwan
in case of conflict with mainland China by selling it defensive
weapons should the island lose its economic advantages, Teng said.</P>

      <P>A group of Taiwan businessmen who have
invested in mainland China strongly urged the government Tuesday to
open direct trade, mail and transportation links across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>The entrepreneurs, many of whom are senior executives of
Taiwanese chambers of commerce in major mainland Chinese cities, made
the call at a seminar organized by the cross-strait affairs panel
under the soon-to-be-convened Economic Development Advisory
Conference (EDAC).</P>
      <P>Yeh Chun-jung, a representative of the Taiwanese Trade
Association in Dongguan, in the southern mainland province of
Guangdong, said the government should adjust its mainland policy in
line with the changing global and regional political and economic
situation, as well as the domestic investment climate.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the government should not continue to reject the call
for opening the direct cross-strait "three links" and easing the "go
slow, be patient" policy on mainland China-bound investment on the
excuse of "safeguarding national security."</P>
      <P>Many representatives of Taiwan-financed companies in mainland
China also urged the government to resume cross-strait dialogue under
the so-called 1992 "one China, separate definitions" consensus in
order to protect their interests.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Kun-chung, president of the Taiwanese Business Association

regulations governing cross-strait civilian exchanges to allow Taiwan
investors to join mainland Chinese official organizations such as the
National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, representatives of Taiwan's major

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT URGED TO MAKE CHANGE IN POLICY TOWARD MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  7  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government should step up efforts to
ease its mainland China investment policy and set up direct links
with the mainland in order to avoid Taiwan becoming a "second Cuba,"
mainland-based Taiwan businessmen said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>More than 30 representatives of Taiwan investors in the mainland
made the unanimous call at a panel meeting of the Economic
Development Advisory Conference (EDAC), which was co-chaired by
Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen and Acer Group
Chairman Stan Shih, among others.</P>
      <P>Voicing their strong desire that the government will soon relax
the "no haste, be patient" policy governing mainland-bound
investments by Taiwan businesses and quickly set up direct trade,
transportation and postal links with the mainland, the businessmen
urged the government to make the moves in order to "legalize already
existing practices" and better protect their interests.</P>
      <P>Yeh Chung-jung, a Taiwan businessman based in Dongguan, in
mainland China's Guangdong Province, criticized the government for
its reluctance to revise its policies under the pretext of "national
security" at a time of a rapidly changing business environment.</P>
      <P>Yeh expressed the hope that the EDAC will produce some real
changes for the government's reference, rather than just "playing
tricks to fool the people."</P>
      <P>Chang Wan-tung, a professor of economic science at Fujen Catholic
University, said the government's policies regarding mainland
investment and the "three links" have become a burden instead of
bargaining chips for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Should the government continue to walk this path, he warned,
Taiwan might become another Cuba -- which lost its economic edge
because of its political strife with the United States. He pointed
out that the guarantee for Taiwan's national security is its economic
clout rather than its defensive capabilities or political factors.</P>
      <P>Chiang Yen-hsiung, chairman of the Taiwan Businessman Association
in Shenzhen, urged the government to return to the so-called "1992
consensus" supposed by some to have been agreed upon by the two
sides, adding that the government should negotiate with the mainland
under the "one China, respective interpretations" principle.</P>
      <P>Echoing Chiang's view, representatives of the Taiwan Electrical
and Electronics Manufacturers Association proposed that the two sides
continue their exchanges under a new slogan -- "one Chinese people,
respective definitions."</P>
      <P>In the face of the strong criticism from the private sector,
Tsai, Taiwan's top policy maker toward mainland China, declined to
respond to any of the proposals raised during the meeting.</P>
      <P>Shi Hwei-you, vice chairman of the semi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), which is in charge of exchanges with mainland China
in the absence of official contacts across the Taiwan Strait, said
the problems between Taiwan and mainland China are the two sides'
positioning toward each other and the military hostilities.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the mainland should try to find an explanation
acceptable to both sides and clinch a peace agreement to ease the
tension, he suggested.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAISALT PRODUCTS MAKING INROADS INTO MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Consumer products from the state-run Taiwan
Salt Industrial Corp. (Taisalt) are ready to make inroads into
mainland China via Hong Kong, Taisalt sources said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Taisalt's consumer products -- which include shampoo, facial
cleanser, shower milk and toothpaste and are all slightly different
from other such products because they contain salt as a major
ingredient -- will be first marketed in four Hong Kong-based
supermarket franchises before being introduced to mainland China via
the special administrative district, according to Taisalt Chairman Yu
Kuang-hua.</P>
      <P>The Taisalt products will have to enter the mainland via Hong
Kong because Taisalt is a state-owned company and none of its
products can legitimately be exported directly to mainland China
under current regulations, Yu noted.</P>
      <P>The four categories of Taisalt products are expected to generate
NT$450 million (US$13 million) in Hong Kong and mainland China in the
next three years, Yu added.</P>
      <P>Addressing a press conference to mark the launch of Taisalt
products on world markets, Yu noted that the products will also be
marketed in the United States in the coming years, aimed primarily at
Chinese American consumers.</P>
      <P>Unconfirmed sources have said that Taisalt's salty shampoo has
been hotly sought after by Japanese tourists to Taiwan over the past
one year. The Japanese are said to have been buying the Taisalt
shampoo because the product has a "miraculous effect" in arresting
baldness.</P>
      <P>Taisalt consumer products, particularly the salty facial
cleansing milk, have enjoyed brisk domestic sales over the past year
with recommendations being passed back and forth on the Internet,
according to Taisalt marketing authorities.</P>
      <P>The brisk sales -- up 110 percent in the first half year of 2000
over the same period of the previous year -- represent a "miracle" in
the state-run company's transition to privatization amid the
widespread economic distress in Taiwan, and marks an unprecedented
page in the company's marketing history, Taisalt personnel said.</P>
      <P>Taisalt is the one and only producer, supplier and distributor of
salt and salt-derived products in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Also addressing the press conference, Lin Wen-yuan, vice chairman
of the Commission of National Corporations under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs, lauded Taisalt's performance in successfully
marketing its consumer products as a fine example of business
transition for all state-run enterprises making the sometimes painful
change to private ownership.</P>

      <P>The government of the Macau Special

the Taiwan authorities to grant 14-day landing visas to Macau
residents who have visited Taiwan before.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China Ministry of the Interior announced a day

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 7 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Su
Chi said Tuesday that a round-table conference scheduled to be held
in New York Aug. 12-14 for delegates from Taiwan, mainland China,
Hong Kong and the United States had been canceled.</P>
      <P>"I do not know the reason, but the advance announcement of the
holding of the conference is said to be the reason for the
cancellation," Su said.</P>
      <P>The round-table conference, dubbed the "second channel" of
relations between Taipei, Beijing and Washington, had been organized
by the U.S.-based National Committee on American Foreign Policy.</P>
      <P>The conference would have been of special significance because it
would have been the first gathering of its kind for officials from
Taiwan, mainland China and the U.S. since the inauguration of the
Bush administration, Su noted.</P>
      <P>Su had been invited to attend the conference in his capacity as
convener of the national security division under the National Policy
Foundation -- an opposition Kuomintang think tank.</P>
      <P>Other Taiwan delegates would have included Antonio Chiang, deputy
secretary-general of the National Security Council (NSC); Kao
Ying-mao, a consultant to the NSC; and Wu Jui-kuo, special assistant
to opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, the National Committee on American Foreign Policy has
convened the round-table conference once every six months to discuss
Washington's China policy.</P>
      <P>Conclusions of the conference are presented to policy makers in
Washington, Taipei and Beijing for reference.</P>
      <P>As the conference has played the role as a "second channel" of
communication between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait since the
suspension of bilateral contact in July 1999, ROC President Chen
Shui-bian has openly affirmed the function of the conference.</P>
      <P>After President George Bush took office Jan. 20, the national
committee called a one-day mini round-table conference Feb. 8 to
discuss the new government's China policy. Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou
was the only non-American delegate invited to present a report to the
conference.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An election campaign institute, dubbed the
"Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) School," is expected to be established
shortly, with classes scheduled to open in late August, TSU sources
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A number of specialists in politics who are "seasoned
electioneers," like former President Lee Teng-hui, will lecture at
the school, which is expected to open classes in northern and
southern Taiwan so as to allow students in both the north and south
of the country to have equal opportunities to attend, said TSU
spokesman Su Chin-chiang.</P>
      <P>The prospective students of the school, the first of its kind in
Taiwan, will be the 40-odd candidates to be fielded by the TSU in the
year-end legislative elections, along with related personnel in the
soon-to-be-formed party, according to Su.</P>
      <P>The TSU is scheduled to be formally established Aug. 12 as a new
political party in Taiwan, with most of its members being followers
of Lee.</P>
      <P>One of the top goals of the TSU is to consolidate ballots of
supporters of Lee, said Su, who added that TSU members have
maintained close and frequent interaction with the former president
and that the TSU school is a "stage" where cooperation between Lee
and his supporters will come to the fore.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chief of the General Staff Gen. Tang
Yao-ming warned his countrymen Tuesday that the "seeming peace"
across the Taiwan Strait belies Beijing's military ambitions against
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a speech to officers at the General Headquarters of the
Combined Service Force, Tang said Taiwan should not base its national
security on a "romantic vision" or "unrealistic illusion" regarding
Beijing.</P>
      <P>He warned that Beijing is pursuing a two-pronged policy:
soliciting Taiwan's investment to "soften the alertness of the people
of Taiwan," while building up military strength as a last resort to
"bring the island to heel."</P>
      <P>Beijing's "charm offense" against Taiwan businessmen is a
circuitous way to bring pressure to bear on the Taiwan authorities
through its own businessmen who are eager to explore the mainland
markets, Tang claimed.</P>
      <P>He warned the public not to lower their guard against Beijing,
despite its repeated assurances that its military exercises are not
targeted at Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also urged the Republic of China's armed forces to enhance
their combat readiness in the face of Beijing's persistent military

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 7 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian vowed Tuesday to do
his utmost to travel to Denmark in November to receive in person a
prize from the Liberal International organization.</P>
      <P>In a meeting with a group of visiting Canadian parliamentarians,
Chen said that the "2001 Prize for Freedom" granted to him by the
Liberal International is an acknowledgment of the Taiwan people's
achievements in democracy and that he is more than willing to collect
it in person.</P>
      <P>Promising to do everything possible to make the trip, the
president said it would be a great pity if he is shut out of
Copenhagen because of pressure from Beijing.</P>
      <P>The Liberal International decided to award the prize to Chen
earlier this year to honor his "outstanding contribution to freedom
and liberalism in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Chen also challenged Ottawa to follow Washington's suit in
granting him a visa for transit stops.</P>
      <P>Although this would inevitably draw protests from Beijing, Chen
said, Canada should "do what it thinks right."</P>
      <P>As for ties between Taipei and Ottawa, Chen called for the
conclusion of an accord to avoid double taxation, saying it would
clear the way for economic exchanges.</P>
      <P>He also appealed for visa-free status for short term Taiwan
visitors to Canada, since Taiwan has already granted similar
privileges to Canadian tourists.</P>
      <P>Noting that several Republic of China officials have been denied
access to Canada recently, Chen called on Ottawa to lift its
prohibition on visas to Taiwan senior officials, which he said has
seriously hindered the exchanges of high-level officials between the
two sides.</P>
      <P>He expressed thanks for Ottawa's support for the island's bids to
join the World Trade Organization, and expressed hope that support
will be expanded to the island's attempts to join the World Health
Organization, because "there should be no boundaries for medical
cooperation and healthcare cooperation" and the world suffers by
excluding the island from the WHO.</P>
      <P>Chen also urged Canada to concern itself more aggressively with
peace across the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan called a cross-agency
meeting Tuesday to discuss the release of two Greek seamen who have
been barred from leaving Taiwan since their cargo ship spilled over
1,000 tons of oil off the coast of southern Taiwan in January.</P>
      <P>Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) Administrator Hau
Lung-bin told reporters after the meeting that no decision was made
on whether to release the captain and chief engineer of the Amorgos.</P>
      <P>He said that his agency would take action to resolve the issue
"as soon as possible" and added that he would also ask the owner and
the insurance company of the freighter to present letters of
guarantee at an early date.</P>
      <P>The cross-agency meeting was called at the request of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) and was attended by officials from
the EPA, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications and the
Justice Ministry.</P>
      <P>The EPA contended that it has prohibited the two crewmen from
leaving the country based on related laws with the purpose of
"helping the investigation of the incident," which polluted a coral
reef preservation region near Kenting National Park.</P>
      <P>Regarding a report that the compensation demanded by the EPA is
also "too high," the EPA chief said that assessment of the damage is
being made by "an international company," and added that the amount
will not be fixed for at least six months.</P>
      <P>He noted that at the moment, the EPA just wants the owner and the
insurance company to present letters of guarantee.</P>
      <P>A ranking MOFA official admitted that his ministry has received
great pressure from the families and friends of the crewmen, as well
as human right groups.</P>
      <P>He said that his ministry has played a role of conveying relevant
information between the Taiwan and Greek sides, with the hope that
the issue will be resolved soon.</P>

Wednesday that it welcomes the consensus reached between judicial
authorities of the Republic of China and the United States on mutual

consensus on a 20-article judicial assistance agreement.</P>
      <P>Under the accord, law enforcement officers will cooperate in the
questioning of witnesses and the supply of relevant documents,
transcriptions and evidence, as well as in carrying out searches and

      <P>Chang said the new agreement will contribute to efforts by both
sides at cracking down on cross-border criminal activities. The
agreement, however, does not touch on the deportation of criminal
suspects as such issues involve the signing of an extradition pact.</P>
      <P>The draft accord will be initialed after the relevant government
agencies of the two countries approve its content. And the pact will

    <HEADLINE>JUNIOR TEAM CANADA TO VISIT TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, Aug. 7 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of young Canadians will visit Taiwan
later this week for a two-week stay during which they will meet with
business, government and youth leaders as part of a program jointly
sponsored by the Canadian government and private sector.</P>
      <P>The group, dubbed Junior Team Canada, was formed under a program
called Global Vision, which is designed to provide Canadian youths
between 16 and 25 years old with the skills and knowledge needed to
forge future careers in the international marketplace.</P>
      <P>Amy Giroux, leader of the 25-member team, said Tuesday that she
thanks the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Canada for its
assistance in making the visit happen.</P>
      <P>She and her teammates were briefed on the latest developments in
the Republic of China on Taiwan during a lunch meeting at the TECO
office in downtown Ottawa.</P>
      <P>After seeing a short film on Taiwan, the Canadian youths raised a
series of questions on topics such as Taiwan citizens' perceptions of
Canada, the pension fund situation in Taiwan, and the prospects for
future cooperation between the two countries on major infrastructure
projects.</P>
      <P>Leading TECO officials answered the young Canadians' questions as
best as they could and also wished them a happy and rewarding trip to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During their stay in Taiwan, the Canadian youths will attend
functions organized by the Canadian Trade Office in Taipei, visit
cultural and industrial establishments, and tour scenic spots around
the island. They are scheduled to depart Taiwan for Thailand on
Aug. 24.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKER QUESTIONS SINGAPORE-BASED FIRM'S OPERATIONS IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan legislator on Wednesday questioned
the legality of the business practices of a Singapore-based company
that shut down its operations in Taiwan after having bagged what is
believed to be more than NT$10 million (US$289,000).</P>
      <P>People First Party Legislator Chin Huei-chu said at a press
conference at the Legislative Yuan that the Singapore firm
successfully collected the money by issuing More Rewards Cards to
some 110,00 Taiwan consumers over the period of about one year.</P>
      <P>Beginning in April 2000, the firm used television ads intensively
to attract Taiwan consumers to become More Rewards Card members,
claiming that one would be entitled to "products at a super value" by
simply paying NT$100 to become a More Rewards Card holder.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, More Rewards signed up a number of local companies and
retail stores to participate in its "rewards points" program, whereby
More Rewards Card holders could through their purchases accumulate
points which could then be traded in for gifts from the participating
stores.</P>
      <P>In late February of this year, however, the cardholders and
participating stores received notices from More Rewards indicating
that the company had "temporarily suspended" its operations in
Taiwan. Accompanying each notice was an envelop with some
small-denomination postal stamps provided as "compensation" to the
cardholders, according to Chin.</P>
      <P>There has been no trace of the management of the Singaporean
firm's Taiwan operations since March 1, except for a mailing address,
Chin added.</P>
      <P>She said that the "suspension" of the Singaporean firm's
operations has not only made the membership of the Taiwan cardholders
null and void, it has also affected the participating stores, to
which More Rewards is indebted for more than NT$6 million
(US$173,410).</P>
      <P>Chin asked officials from the Cabinet-level Consumer Product
Commission Council (CPCC), who were also present at the press
conference as observers, whether More Rewards has violated any
regulations governing business practices in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>CPCC officials said that More Rewards obtained legal licenses
from both the Taipei City Hall and the Ministry of Economic Affairs
for their operations in Taiwan. Unless the cardholders or the
participating stores file a complaint with the CPCC, More Rewards
will not be dealt with, they added.</P>
      <P>Until recently, none of the More Rewards Card holders have filed
a law suit against the Singaporean firm. The officials said they
reckoned that the chances of success if any of the cardholders make
such a legal move are slim as they each only spent a mere NT$100 for
the card, despite the fact that the total number of cardholders
exceeds 110,000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLA NEEDS TIME TO TACKLE FOREIGN LABOR BASIC WAGE PROBLEMS: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs
(CLA) said Wednesday it takes time to evaluate the pros and cons of a
proposal to cancel basic wage protection for foreign workers.</P>
      <P>The council was responding to reports that President Chen
Shui-bian had expressed concern at a recent government policy
consultative meeting to assess whether wages for foreign laborers are
too high and whether the existing basic wage regulations will affect
Taiwan industries' competitiveness in the world market.</P>
      <P>Chen reportedly asked the Cabinet to study the feasibility of
excluding foreign laborers from the basic wage requirement set forth
in the existing Labor Standards Law.</P>
      <P>He was quoted as having even said that if the difficulty in
de-linking foreign and local labor wage issues lies in international
factors, the Cabinet should not rule out the possibility of
withdrawing from relevant international conventions.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the reports, CLA Vice Chairman Kuo Chi-jen said
relevant issues have been discussed many times. "As the issues
involve complicated problems, no conclusion has been reached so far,"
he noted.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China ratified an international convention on
basic wages in 1930 and an international anti-occupational
discrimination convention in 1961. As a result, foreign laborers in
Taiwan are subject to the same protection as their local
counterparts.</P>
      <P>Kuo said the CLA has not yet considered the possibility of the
ROC's withdrawal from the two international agreements. "I don't
think that the labor wage issue has become so serious that we have to
mull whether to withdraw from any relevant international accord," he
noted.</P>
      <P>Some CLA officials said the government must consider possible
international reaction if it really wants to withdraw from the two
international conventions to facilitate the proposed scrapping of
basic wage protection for foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>Cabinet Secretary-General Chiou I-jen was quoted as having said
at Tuesday's nine-member policy consultative meeting that although
Taiwan's average national income is lower than Singapore's and Hong
Kong's, local employers are required to offer foreign workers wages
1.7 times to twice the amount offered in Singapore and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>"Many local employers have complained about this unreasonable
phenomenon," Chiou said, adding that senior business executives have
suggested that the government de-link wage calculating formulae for
foreign and local laborers in order to better protect blue-collar
Taiwan workers.</P>
      <P>Chiou said the ROC is the only East Asian country that has signed
both the multilateral labor wage convention and the international
anti-occupational discrimination convention.</P>
      <P>Among major East Asian countries, only the ROC, Japan and
mainland China have joined the wage convention, while only the ROC
and South Korea have ratified the anti-occupational discrimination
convention.</P>
      <P>According to Chiou, Taiwan lags behind only Japan in its basic
wage level and the island's basic wage is 1.85 times that of South
Korea. These relatively high labor costs will undermine Taiwan's
global competitiveness, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's current basic labor wage is set at NT$15,480
(US$459.13) per month.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chiou said any changes to the foreign labor wage
formula involves many complicated problems, including revisions to
the existing law, general public opinion and international reaction.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO CONTINUE COOPERATION WITH GAMBIA: ROC PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  8  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday
during a meeting with two visiting ministers from The Gambia that the
Republic of China will implement a protocol on cooperation between
the ROC and the West African nation as scheduled.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he welcomed Secretary of
State for Finance and Economic Affairs Pamara L. Jatta and Secretary
of State for Trade, Industry and Employment Musa H. Sillah, both of
whom were visiting Taiwan for the second time.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that he also received the credentials of new Gambian
Ambassador Essa Bokar Sey the previous day, showing the firm
relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The president asked the two ministers to convey his greeting to
President Yayah Jammeh in appreciation for his concern, the
importance attached to bilateral friendship and his long-term support
for the ROC, especially his concern for the havoc wrecked by Typhoon
Toraji.</P>
      <P>He also expressed the hope that Jammeh will be re-elected in
Gambia's presidential election so as to continue to lead the country
toward prosperity.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that since the two countries resumed diplomatic
relations in July 1995 after a 21-year hiatus, all cooperation
projects have proceeded smoothly and added that the protocol on
cooperation between the two countries has gone well. He further
expressed hope that the two sides continue to increase exchanges and
cooperation based on this protocol.</P>
      <P>He also asked the two ministers to introduce Lin Chun-yi -- the
new ROC ambassador to Gambia soon to assume his post -- to their
country.</P>
      <P>Lin, a biologist and environmental activist, is both erudite and
no stranger to Africa, the president said. During his service with a
Christian church in the United States, Lin was assigned to Tanzania,
Kenya and several other African states to assist in establishing
their biology teaching systems.</P>
      <P>The president expressed the hope that bilateral relations will be
further strengthened after Lin takes the post.</P>
      <P>Jatta also conveyed a personal letter from Jammeh to Chen, adding
that his president has good personal friendship with Chen and
attaches great importance to bilateral relations. He also said Gambia
will continue to support the ROC in the international community
because the ROC is "a true friend of Gambia."</P>
      <P>The two ministers, who arrived Monday to promote trade and
economic relations with the ROC, will leave Taiwan Friday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WORLD VISION HELPS BUILD PREFAB HOUSES FOR TYPHOON VICTIMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  Central Taiwan, Aug. 8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>World Vision Taiwan (WVT)
announced Wednesday that it is preparing to donate NT$10 million
(US$289,017) to help build prefabricated houses for typhoon victims
in Hsinyi township, Nantou County.</P>
      <P>WVT officials said it is hoped that 200 of the prefab dwellings
will be built soon in four villages in the mountainous area to
accommodate displaced residents, mostly aboriginal people, whose
homes were washed away by landslides and mudslides wrought by the
recent passage of Typhoon Toraji across Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The NT$10 million, collected from the "Fast 30" campaign held in
June islandwide for the needy will only partially finance the
building of the 200 houses, which actually will cost some NT$44
million, with each house costing around NT$220,000, WVT officials
said.</P>
      <P>WVT plans to provide NT$160,000 to each applicant household in
the four worst-affected villages, to enable the villagers to buy the
prefab houses, as long as these households can produce related papers
proving that they are legal land users in the area, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>Any shortfall in the funds can be made up with subsidies that the
government has given to those who claimed home damages in the wake of
the typhoon, they added.</P>
      <P>WVT officials said the proposed prefab houses can be used for at
least 10 years, barring future severe earthquakes.</P>
      <P>Nantou County is one of the two areas hardest-hit by Toraji,
which wreaked havoc in eastern and central Taiwan with strong winds
and torrential rain that caused devastating floods, landslides and
mudslides that buried people, washed away houses, destroyed roads and
bridges and ruined fields and plantations.</P>
      <P>As of Tuesday -- the ninth day after the typhoon -- 100 people
had been confirmed killed as a result of the typhoon, while 114
others were still unaccounted for and 189 injured. Besides the heavy
human casualties, some NT$8 billion (US$231 million)-worth of losses
to agriculture was caused by Toraji.</P>
      <P>WVT, one of Taiwan's major charity organizations, has in previous
years sponsored 30-hour fasts islandwide to raise funds to help
famine-stricken or deprived people in the Third World.</P>
      <P>WVT also sponsors 30,000 children in Taiwan and 40,000 children
living in poverty in other countries.</P>

officials said it will not be easy for CeBIT to pose a threat to
Computex in the short term, as the Taipei computer show's 20 years of

      <P>Pengchiayu Islet, Taiwan's northernmost

smuggling and illicit maritime activities across the Taiwan Strait,
sources from the Cabinet-level Coast Guard Administration (CGA) said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The islet, located 55 nautical miles from Taiwan's
northeasternmost city of Keelung, is reportedly the site where
mainland Chinese fishing boats meet their Taiwan counterparts and
sell their fish catches to the Taiwan fishing boats, who nowadays do
not even bother to fish for themselves as "buying the catch is much
cheaper and easier than fishing," according to a coast guard
official.</P>
      <P>After receiving an increasing number of complaints about the
rampant smuggling near Pengchiayu, two district prosecutors from
Keelung City, under which the Pengchiayu Islet is an offshore
administrative district, traveled to the islet Wednesday aboard a CGA
cutter for a fact-finding tour of the islet and its adjacent waters.</P>
      <P>The CGA itself seized 38 mainland Chinese fishing boats between
January and July this year for poaching near Pengchiayu.</P>
      <P>During the same period, CGA patrols also nabbed 536 mainland
Chinese from 82 mainland fishing boats for conducting illegal
transactions of fishery products totaling some 27.7 tons.</P>

      <P>In fact, Lin went on, Japan has never recognized that Taiwan is
part of the PRC. In the 1972 Tokyo-Beijing Joint Communique on the
establishment of bilateral diplomatic relations, Japan says only that
it acknowledges and respects the PRC's sovereign claim to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Lin claimed that the Japanese Ministry
of Justice's registration of ROC expatriates' nationality as
"Chinese" on their Alien Registration Cards is an illegal practice
and "tantamount to document forgery."</P>
      <P>Lin stressed that all major countries around the world, including
Britain, the United States, France and Canada, have consistently
registered ROC expatriates' nationality as "Taiwanese."</P>
      <P>"Only Japan is an exception," Lin said. "As the crime rate among
mainland Chinese expatriates in Japan is very high, the Japanese
government's registration of Taiwan people's nationality as `Chinese'
has brought them much trouble and confusion."</P>
      <P>Therefore, he continued, the Taiwanese Association has launched a
"nationality correction" campaign.</P>
      <P>Lin was later allowed to enter the Immigration Bureau to discuss
the issue with relevant Japanese officials. However, the immigration
officials said that as the nationality issue is not within the
bureau's power, they were not in a position to make any comment on
the petition.</P>
      <P>Lin said he was dissatisfied with the immigration officials'
reaction to their petition. "We'll continue our protest and
petition," he added.</P>
      <P>The demonstrators then paraded to the Japanese Ministry of
Justice to present their petition there and to demand that the
ministry take immediate steps to phase out the insulting, harmful
practice meted out to Taiwan expatriates in Japan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP HEAD CALLS FOR FORGING OF `REAL MAINSTREAM' AMONG OPPOSITION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hualien  County,  eastern  Taiwan, Aug. 8 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People
First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong said Wednesday that Taiwan's
three main opposition parties should not try to "parcel out the big
pie" of year-end election votes but should instead aim at forging a
"real mainstream."</P>
      <P>During a visit to eastern Taiwan's Hualien County to inspect the
extensive damage caused by last week's Typhoon Toraji, Soong urged
the parties not to become engrossed in another battle of words.</P>
      <P>He added that "the people" want to see the opposition parties
arrive at a common ground on the issues that are of greatest concern
to the public.</P>
      <P>Soong said that although competition is inevitable during an
election campaign, he hopes the opposition Kuomitang (KMT) will
support PFP candidates as the PFP supports KMT candidates and will
stop saying that the PFP is destroying unity among the opposition.</P>
      <P>Responding to an opposition New Party claim that the PFP does not
have a clear stance on its policies, Soong stressed that the PFP
believes in "one China, with Taiwan and the mainland allowed to make
its own interpretations as to the meaning of the term."</P>
      <P>He added that cross-Taiwan Strait relations must proceed
according to the stages set forth in the Guidelines for National
Unification and that the conditions for immediate unification do not
exist at present.</P>
      <P>Describing himself as "both Taiwanese and Chinese," Soong said
that he loves Taiwan and that both sides of the Taiwan Strait --
being Chinese -- should strive to create opportunities for peace and
the forging of common ground.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   8   (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Huang Chu-wen, convenor of the
soon-to-be-formed Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) political party,
unveiled its inauguration manifesto Wednesday, stressing solidarity
for a strong Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Huang, accompanied by TSU spokesmen Su Chin-chiang and Chen
Chien-ming, along with several other TSU legislative candidates,
unveiled the manifesto at a press conference. They repeatedly chanted
in unison their slogan to "unite and move forward for a strong
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The TSU announced that party politics and parliamentary politics
in Taiwan have not contributed to the country's democratic
development but have rather become the biggest obstacle to its
healthy development.</P>
      <P>Huang, a former minister of the interior who is closely linked to
former Republic of China President and former Kuomintang Chairman Lee
Teng-hui, said that TSU members have decided to pursue the goal of a
stable political situation, a revived economy, a solid democracy and
a strong Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the basic stance of the TSU, Huang said that the ROC "is an
independent sovereign state standing firm in the world," and that
cross-strait relations are not about unification or independence, but
about "different natures of democracy and freedom."</P>
      <P>The people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait share the same
language and have similar ethnic feelings, the present cross-strait
relationship should be "based on the Republic of China and the
People's Republic of China concurrently existing in the world" and
they should engage with each other on an equal footing and on a
mutually beneficial basis, according to the manifesto.</P>
      <P>It also claimed that Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu are a
single community and that there should be no ethnic or even regional
differences, with everyone identifying with Taiwan and prepared to
fight for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Huang stressed that the government should root out "black gold
politics," saying that the government should deal severely with
vote-buying in the year-end elections, especially vote-buying by a
"super conglomerate" with huge party assets -- an oblique jab at the
opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>The manifesto stressed that the party is being formed in order to
"serve the people" and that the TSU will be "adamantly opposed to
political parties engaged in endless political squabbling."</P>
      <P>Lee, the "spiritual father" of the TSU, raised the ire of KMT
members when he said that he wanted to form a political party to help
the present minority government of President Chen Shui-bian gain
enough seats to form a stable majority in the year-end legislative
election.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Scores of prominent international figures,
including six Nobel Peace Prize winners, have been invited to Taipei
next week for a "Voice from Taiwan, Peace and Love" campaign
initiated by Republic of China Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>Lu said at a news conference Wednesday that the campaign will be
launched Aug. 15 in commemoration of the end of World War II 56 years
ago.</P>
      <P>Noting that peace can only be secured with wisdom, Lu said that
in the face of mainland China's mounting military threat, Taiwan must
use what she described as "its unique soft national power" to win
international support.</P>
      <P>"Only by so doing can the small `Taiwan kitten' withstand the
perennial threat of the fierce `China lion,'" Lu stressed.</P>
      <P>Lu said she was moved by the fact that local organizers of the
event have invited a number of international dignitaries to attend
the "Voice from Taiwan" activity.</P>
      <P>"This indicates that the international community is highly
supportive of Taiwan. The people of Taiwan should not be pessimistic
about the island's future," said Lu, an outspoken critic of mainland
China's military threat and diplomatic embargo against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Nobel Peace Prize winners invited to attend the event include
former Polish President Lech Walesa; Oscar Arias Sanchez, who served
as Costa Rica's president from 1986 to 1990; former South African
President F.W. de Clerk and Betty Williams, a peace advocate from
Ireland.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Nobel Prize winners, lawmakers and
parliamentarians from many friendly nations and chief executive
officers from 11 NGO groups have agreed to take part in the "Voice
from Taiwan" drive, which will feature a 2001 Global Peace Assembly
forum scheduled for Aug. 15-16 and an Evening for Global Peace slated

    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior official of the Cabinet-level
Mongolian and Tibetan Commission suggested Wednesday that the
government should join other Asian nations and render assistance to
Mongolia in order to strengthen relations with the country.</P>
      <P>Wang Wei-fang, a counselor at the commission, said that Mongolia
has been promoting relations with foreign countries since early this
year and its relations with South Korea, Singapore and Japan are
closer than ever before.</P>
      <P>The government of the Republic of China has made efforts to
promote bilateral relations between the ROC and Mongolia since 1991,
Wang went on.</P>
      <P>Promoting multilateral relations has become a key point of
foreign relations around the world since the rearrangement of the
superpower map in 1990, Wang pointed out. Mongolia's president and
premier visited economically developed countries in Asia already this
year, she said.</P>
      <P>She added that Mongolia has been struggling with political and
economic transformation since the Soviet Union collapsed and that
this has provided an opportunity for economically powerful Asian
countries such as Japan, South Korea and Singapore to fill the vacuum
left by the Soviet Union.</P>
      <P>Japan, South Korea and Singapore will present their political and
economic reforms for Mongolia as reference and eventually establish
reciprocal relations with Mongolia, Wang said.</P>
      <P>She went on to point out that relations between the ROC and
Mongolia, even though they have been conducted since 1991, have been
largely unsuccessful, and suggested that the government play a more
positive role in promoting bilateral relations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the fact that Taiwan's economic
growth rate had slowed as compared to the percentage posted in the
first quarter, the ratio for the second quarter of this year should
be between 1 percent and zero, a government official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lee Kao-chao, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development, forecast that the Q2 economic
growth rate should be able to hit around 1 percent if private-sector
consumption, which accounts for 62 percent of the country's economy,
has not dwindled too much.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, Taiwan's trade surplus grew from US$1.3 billion
in the first quarter to US$3.3 billion in the second quarter, which
will contribute a 2.7 percent rise in the country's economy. During
the same three-month period, private investments and product stocks
increased slightly, he noted.</P>
      <P>Lee's forecast echoes a prediction by an official with the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics last week,

called on their counterparts in the mainland Chinese capital of
Beijing Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The delegation, headed by Cheng Chia-lin, president of Taiwan's
Chinese Press Institute, visited China Central Television, where the
deputy editor in chief, Zhao Lifan, said that Republic of China
government regulations are restricting the number of mainland Chinese

      <P>While visiting mainland China's state-run Xinhua News Agency, Ma
Shengrong, vice president of the 12,000-employee news organization,
urged related ROC government agencies to relax such "unfair"
regulations because mainland China does not have similar restrictions
on reporters from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that his agency was able to send five reporters to Taiwan
in the past but currently has no reporter stationed there because of
the policy.</P>
      <P>When Shaw Yu-ming, chairman of Taiwan's Central Daily News,

    <HEADLINE>KMT ASKS VOTERS TO APPLY PRESSURE ON OPPOSITION FOR COOPERATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 8 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Kuomintang (KMT) senior official turned to
supporters of the KMT and its two allies to put pressure on the
so-called "pan-blue forces" to cooperate, rather than compete against
each other in the year-end elections.</P>
      <P>Amid signs that the KMT and its two splinter groups, the People
First Party and the New Party, have failed to jointly field
candidates for local government heads, Liu Chao-shuan, the vice
chairman of a KMT think tank, the National Policy Foundation, asked
that supporters of the three parties demand that the party leaders
sort out their differences instead of competing against each other
and playing into the hands of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP).</P>
      <P>In a speech at the meeting of the KMT Central Standing Committee,
Liu said the KMT is still confident that cooperation by the three
parties can be obtained given the strong desire from their supporters
for them to find common ground.</P>
      <P>The pressure from their supporters will force the three parties
to compete shoulder to shoulder against the DPP despite the fact that
their leaders might have their own axes to grind and their candidates
might have personal feuds against each other, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Liu appealed to the supporters of the "pan-blue forces" to
withdraw their support to any one of the three parties whose leaders
balk at or block efforts at cooperation.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that the KMT conduct polls among candidates
from the three parties as a guideline for the public to better
understand their policies and, therefore, get some feel for which
candidate has the best chance of winning.</P>
      <P>Liu also recommended that his party form a shadow Cabinet to show
its supporters what kind of government they could expect if the party
wins a majority in the legislature and, therefore, were to be asked
to form a Cabinet.</P>
      <P>With five-decades of experience in ruling, Liu said the KMT has
the most talented people to form the best ruling team, which ought to
be made up of members of the "pan-blue forces," he said.</P>
      <P>The KMT, which is the leading party in the legislature, has
always advocated that any party which controls the legislature should
form the backbone of the government under what it calls the bi-headed
governmental system. The idea has been rejected by President Chen
Shui-bian and his DPP.</P>
      <P>Liu said the shadow Cabinet will help the KMT to sell its
bi-headed governmental system to the voters.</P>
      <P>Wednesday's meeting is the first for the KMT's newly-elected 31
Central Standing Committee members, during which KMT Chairman Lien
Chan said it is the KMT's inescapable obligation to unite the other
two parties to compete with the DPP in the year-end elections.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Lin Fong-cheng said after the meeting that
his party has not changed its stance of working together with the PFP
and the New Party according to the wishes of the supporters of the
three parties.</P>
      <P>However, cooperation for the elections is a difficult task, and
the three parties have agreed not to attack each other and vie for
victory on their own.</P>
      <P>Meaningful cooperation will begin only after the elections, Lin
said.</P>

      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
said Wednesday that the upcoming Economic Development Advisory
Conference "must be a success" so that the countrymen will not be
disappointed.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while hearing reports on the progress of the
five divisions under the advisory conference.</P>
      <P>As the five divisions are required to present their conclusions
by Aug. 18 for final-stage discussions, Chen asked the Cabinet
ministers responsible for division discussions to brief him on the
progress of their preparations.</P>
      <P>The president expressed his thanks to the officials for their
efforts to ensure a successful conference.</P>
      <P>He asked relevant ministries and agencies to consider drafting
and amending related laws for prompt implementation of the
conference's conclusions.</P>
      <P>Chen told the participants that the cross-party conference
carries the "maximum expectations" of the people and added that it
"must be a success -- failure is not permissible."</P>
      <P>During the division discussions, he said, the delegates from all
quarters should be encouraged to present their various opinions
before reaching a consensus.</P>
      <P>Chen reiterated that he will faithfully respect the conclusions
reached at the conference and the government should have 100 percent
determination to implement the conclusions without any reservations.</P>
      <P>As some topics cannot be settled by a single division, the

    <HEADLINE>LABOR OFFICIAL IN FAVOR OF WAGE PROTECTION FOR FOREIGN WORKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  8 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top labor official said Wednesday
that she opposes the idea that foreign laborers' wages will no longer
be subject to the country's minimum wage requirement, as the Republic
of China is a country that values equality while pursuing
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Chen Chu, chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA), made the remark in response to a suggestion made by a
presidential policy coordination panel that foreign workers not be
subject to the minimum wage limit as stipulated in the country's
Labor Standards Law.</P>
      <P>The nine-member panel, composed of high ranking officials from
the Presidential Office, Legislative Yuan, ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), and DPP caucus in the Legislative Yuan, has
been asked by President Chen Shui-bian to study ways to reduce
foreign labor costs for local entrepreneurs.</P>
      <P>President Chen has been very concerned about the fact that among
Asian countries, the foreign labor cost in Taiwan is behind only
South Korea, but is 2.79 times that of Singapore and 1.42 times that
of Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China ratified an international convention on
basic wages in 1930 and an international anti-occupational
discrimination convention in 1961. As a result, foreign laborers in
Taiwan are subject to the same protection as their local
counterparts.</P>
      <P>Chen Chu said that it is not yet a decision but a request by the
panel that the CLA evaluate the idea. For this, she said Taiwan is a
country that respects laborers while pursuing progress, therefore, it
has the minimum wage regulation.</P>
      <P>However, if foreign laborers are no longer protected by the
minimum wage regulation, it is not only a step backwards, but could
also cause disputes in the International Labour Organization, a group
dedicated to the pursuit of social justice.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that she understands the difficulty in Taiwan's
economic development and suggested that foreign laborers' minimum
wage be calculated on an hourly rather than a monthly basis, or have
their salaries include board as is the case for local laborers.</P>
      <P>At present, foreign laborers' salaries do not include board and
employers have to spend more to cover this cost, Chen said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Dharma Master Cheng Yen,
founder of the Buddhist Tzu Chi Compassionate and Relief Foundation,
said Wednesday that Tzu Chi will continue to provide care for
residents affected by Typhoon Toraji.</P>
      <P>Tzu Chi, the largest charity organization in Taiwan, joined the
rescue and relief operations soon after Toraji swept eastern and
central Taiwan July 30.</P>
      <P>The typhoon had claimed over 100 lives as of Wednesday, with some
120 others remaining unaccounted for.</P>
      <P>In the past 10 days, Tzu Chi has mobilized over 2,900 volunteers
to join the rescue and relief operations, mainly in Hualien and
Nantou counties.</P>
      <P>They provided hot meals and drinking water for 13,000 and medical
treatment for 430, and helped clean 78 mud-filled houses.</P>
      <P>Twelve prefabricated houses for the affected residents are being
built by Tzu Chi at Chienching village in Wanjung township, Hualien
County. They will be completed by the end of this month.</P>
      <P>Tzu Chi has also distributed relief funds to 508 households and
set up six service stations in disaster areas.</P>
      <P>Cheng Yen presided over a meeting to review the rescue and relief
operations Wednesday and said that Tzu Chi must continue providing
care for the affected people.</P>
      <P>Regarding whether to help reconstruction of damaged schools and
resettlement of the affected residents, she said that Tzu Chi "will
continue to make assessments."</P>
      <P>Tzu Chi has not launched a campaign to raise funds for those left
in need by the typhoon, but its members in the United States and
Malaysia have begun collecting donations.</P>
      <P>After the devastating earthquake that struck central Taiwan Sept.

    <HEADLINE>ENVIRONMENTALISTS RUNNING VEGETABLE OIL-POWERED BUS ACROSS CANADA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Aug.  8  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of young environmentalists are
trying to drive home a message to Canadians -- save the earth from
greenhouse gas emissions before it is too late.</P>
      <P>Their tool for sending out this message is a bus that runs on
vegetable oil. A group that calls itself Climate Change Caravan is
taking the bus across Canada from Vancouver to Halifax to focus
attention on the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      <P>At seven or eight miles to the gallon, the bus is not exactly
fuel efficient. At about US$4.20 per liter, it's more than four times
the price of gasoline, which currently costs about US$1 per liter in
Canada.</P>
      <P>But the environmentally friendly point is that the bus uses
recycled oil. "It would be costly if we got it unused, but we get the
oil from restaurants that deep-fry their food, and we just need to
filter out all of the chunks of French fries and put the oil right
into our bus. So it actually runs free," Climate Change Caravan
Spokesman Graeme Verhulst said.</P>
      <P>At stops on their Vancouver to Halifax trip, members of the
caravan set up a windmill and a solar panel to power up their laptops
and cell phones.</P>
      <P>Verhulst pointed out that the level of greenhouse gas emissions
from vegetable oil is about 50 percent lower than that from gasoline.
"There is a little bit more nitrous oxide emitted, but no sulfites
whatsoever, which is a big part of what makes up smog," he said.</P>
      <P>The caravan, which also includes about 30 cyclists, was in Ottawa
on Wednesday urging the federal government to increase its greenhouse
gas emission targets.</P>
      <P>Governments worldwide, including the government of Canada, are
talking about reducing greenhouse gas emissions by between 5 percent
and 6 percent, Verhulst noted.</P>
      <P>"Scientists are calling for greenhouse gas reductions of between
50 (percent) and 80 percent in order to stabilize the climate at a
safe level," he said, pointing out that "this is clearly not in the
same ballpark."</P>
      <P>He claimed that the unusually warm weather much of Canada is
experiencing this summer proves that climate change is a serious
issue. The resident of British Columbia warned that the problem will
only get worse unless people start conserving energy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER TO VISIT 4 ROC DIPLOMATIC ALLIES IN CARIBBEAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  9  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung will visit four
Republic of China diplomatic allies located in the eastern Caribbean,
the vice minister of foreign affairs confirmed Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wu Tzu-dan stressed that the premier's visit will be significant
and that his itinerary will not overlap with Foreign Affairs Minister
Tien Hung-mao's visit to the Caribbean in late August, pointing out
the nature of the two visits is different.</P>
      <P>He added that Tien will take part in a meeting of foreign
ministers and the premier will be invited to attend significant
events.</P>
      <P>The four allies have invited the premier to lead a delegation for
a visit, said Wu, noting that the MOFA is now making arrangements for
the visit. He added that the details of the premier's visit will be
announced later.</P>
      <P>Government Spokesman Su Tzen-ping said that for diplomatic
reasons, the MOFA will assess the feasibility of the ROC president,
vice president or the presidents of the five yuans visiting
ROC allies or nations that maintain substantial relations with the ROC
but do not have formal diplomatic relations with it, and will then
make suggestions to them after making its assessments.</P>
      <P>Su said that the ROC government will announce any such visits in
due time, adding that he could not confirm or deny the premier's trip
to the Caribbean.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks when responding to news about the premier's
trip to Saint Christopher and Nevis, Saint Vincent and the
Grenadines, Dominica, as well as Grenada.</P>
      <P>The reports said that the premier's trip was arranged before
Typhoon Toraji swept across Taiwan July 29-30. With the nation now
focused on post-disaster reconstruction, the reports said the
announcement of the visit is being cautiously assessed by the
Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>It is learned that the premier's visit will fall sometime between
the conclusion of the Economic Development Advisory Conference, to
take place Aug. 24-26, and the start of the new session of the
Legislative Yuan in early September.</P>
      <P>If everything goes well and the trip takes place, it will
represent Premier Chang's first overseas visit since assuming his
current post.</P>
      <P>Overseas Chinese living in Southeast Asia had earlier in his term
invited the premier to visit the region, but Chang responded at that
time by saying that it might be difficult for him to visit the
countries in the region in his capacity as the ROC premier.</P>
      <P>Chang, a devout Christian, was also invited to Seoul in May by
South Korean legislators to attend a Taiwan and South Korean
Christian parliamentarian alliance ceremony, but the premier said at
that time that he appreciated the invitation but had no intention of
taking an overseas trip.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee Cheng-chung, a party whip of the opposition
Kuomintang in the Legislature, said Thursday that he is opposed to
any overseas trips by President Chen Shui-bian or the premier in the
aftermath of Typhoon Toraji, pointing out that this is typhoon season
and "not a time for tourism."</P>
      <P>Citing reports of the president's planned visit to Denmark and
the premier's planned visit to ROC diplomatic allies in the
Caribbean, he said they are "rushing on overseas visits" and "leaving
disaster-relief work behind."</P>
      <P>He lamented the fact that the Executive Yuan told the Legislative
Yuan earlier in the week that there is "no money for disaster relief
but that they now seem to "have money to spend on traveling
overseas."</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.N. BID AIMED AT HIGHLIGHTING UNFAIR TREATMENT ROC ENDURES: ENVOY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles,  Aug.  9  (CNA)
(By Lawrence Chu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's bid to join
major international organizations is mainly aimed at highlighting the
unfair treatment it has endured in the world society, ROC
Representative to the United States Chen Chien-jen said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In a speech delivered at a lunch meeting organized by the Los
Angeles World Affairs Council, Chen said although the ROC's road
to the United Nations may be rugged, the ROC government and people
will not be daunted by any stumbling block standing in the way.</P>
      <P>"The main purpose of our U.N. bid is to call for world attention
to the unfair and unreasonable treatment our country has received
over the past years," Chen told his audience.</P>
      <P>Since 1992, the ROC has annually asked the U.N. General Assembly
through its diplomatic allies to tackle issues regarding Taiwan's
representation in the world body. However, its bid had consistently
been shot down at the U.N. Steering Committee meeting and failed to
make the General Assembly agenda due to mainland China's opposition.</P>
      <P>This year, 10 of the ROC's allies have filed a similar request
with the U.N. Secretariat. Its fate remains unclear as the Steering
Committee has yet to discuss the issue.</P>
      <P>The ROC, a U.N. founding member, has been shut out of the United
Nations since mainland China took over the China seat in the world
body in 1971.</P>
      <P>In his speech, titled "A Robust Relationship: The Republic of
China on Taiwan and the United States," Chen recognized the current
constructive development in bilateral relations between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>The de facto ROC ambassador to the United States also said he
himself is confident and optimistic about the future prospects for
substantive ROC-U.S. relations.</P>
      <P>As many American political and economic analysts have expressed
concern about Taiwan's current economic downturn, Chen made some
explanations in his speech.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that Taiwan's present economic plight is
largely related to a lingering global economic slowdown. With its
economic strength, Chen said, Taiwan would certainly be able to
overcome its current cyclic recession.</P>
      <P>Touching on Taiwan's bid to join the World Trade Organization,
Chen said the ROC is likely to be admitted to the
Geneva-based world trade regulatory body in November or
late this year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said, the ROC hopes that the United States can
take active steps to help promote Taiwan's bid to join the World
Health Organization as an observer.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TEACHER WHO DROWNED ESCORTING STUDENTS TO SAFETY CITED BY PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Yuanlin,  central  Taiwan, Aug. 9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Elementary school teacher
Hsu Pi-lan, who drowned while escorting pupils to safety at the
height of a flood wrought by Typhoon Toraji, was commemorating
Wednesday for her unselfishness with a national outpouring of grief
and respect.</P>
      <P>Education Minister Ovid Tzeng presented a citation awarded by
President Chen Shui-bian to Hsu's husband Hung Chih-ying, who is also
a teacher, lauding the young school teacher for the unselfish love
she demonstrated to her students in the moment of crisis.</P>
      <P>Hsu drowned July 30, probably because of fatigue, after making
numerous trips back and forth from the school alongside a turbulent
river to escort her first-grade students to higher ground. The water
level of the turbulent river along which she was carrying out the
rescue rose suddenly during the height of the typhoon.</P>
      <P>Hsu was washed away downstream by the flood waters before the
very eyes of her young students. Her body was found later in the day
in a ditch along the river.</P>
      <P>Although it was the summer break, teachers and students returned
to the school July 30 for a mid-vacation back-to-school day, and the
local authorities in Yuanlin were caught unprepared for the
devastation that would be brought by the typhoon, failing to notify
the school in time to cancel the event.</P>
      <P>Hsu, a graduate of National Changhua Teachers University, had
only been married to Hung for less than two years and had only
recently become a mother, giving birth to a baby son two months
earlier.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian turned up at the home of Hsu and Hung
earlier this week to pay his respects to Hsu and express his
condolences to her family members.</P>
      <P>During the funeral, Hsu's father, restraining his grief over the
loss of his daughter, said he hopes Hsu's son will grow up healthy
and someday become a teacher like his mother.</P>
      <P>Hsu's father-in-law vowed at the funeral that he will see to it
that a bridge is built near the school so that teachers and students
will no longer suffer similar hardships going home in bad weather.</P>

      <P>The international market for IT hardware products has been
sluggish due to the global economic slowdown and the high levels of
inventory.</P>
      <P>Sales of notebooks, CDT monitors, motherboards, desktop
computers, DVD players and scanners have declined considerably over
the past several months, and only LCD monitors and digital cameras
have demonstrated a growth in sales, according to the MIC report.</P>
      <P>A breakdown of the report's figures shows that in the first half
of this year, the notebook sector registered a 4 percent decline in
sales volume and a 16.9 percent decline in value, the monitor sector
showed a 12.7 percent decline in production volume and a 19.7 percent
drop in value, while the desktop sector registered a 9.5 percent
decline in production volume and a 14.1 percent drop in value.</P>
      <P>The report also said that the market for notebooks is expected to
gradually recover in the second half of this year. However, the
profit margin of Taiwan's OEM notebook factories may shrink further
if and when international firms apply price cuts to grab more market
share.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TEXTILE MANUFACTURERS HOPE TO IMPROVE COMPETITIVENESS THROUGH MERGERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  9  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Executives of Taiwan's leading textile
manufacturers met with Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi
Thursday to study merger possibilities in order to improve their
competitiveness, according to an official of the Industrial
Development Bureau.</P>
      <P>Shih Yen-hsiang, director-general of the Industrial Development
Bureau, said that Taiwan's textile industry has been facing problems
of sluggish business due to oversupply of fibers and yarns in the
international market. It is estimated that Taiwan's fiber and yarn
production capacity is at least 20 percent over demand.</P>
      <P>Textile manufacturers had been major foreign exchange earners for
Taiwan before the traditional industries ran into difficulties.</P>
      <P>Production value of the textile industry in 2000 amounted to
NT$468,722 million, accounting for 5.53 percent of the production
value of all manufacturing industries. In 1996, production value of
the textile industry accounted for 8.76 percent of the overall
production value of the manufacturing sector, according to statistics
compiled by the Taiwan Textile Federation (TTF).</P>
      <P>The TTF statistics indicate that in 1997 Taiwan's textile
industry employed 285,730 workers, representing 12 percent of the
workforce of the manufacturing sector. By 2000, the number of
employees of the textile industry totaled only 239,024, representing
9.8 percent of the manufacturing workforce.</P>
      <P>Manufacturers have reached agreement that Taiwan's textile
industry must lower their production costs and avoid cut-throat
competition, and the only way to maintain their international
competitiveness is through mergers and cooperation.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Development Bureau will play an active role in
coordinating the planning and processing of the mergers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-AUSTRALIA ENERGY CONFAB FOCUSES ON LNG PURCHASE PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  9  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Officials from Taiwan and Australia have
been focusing their discussions over the last two days on a liquefied
natural gas (LNG) purchase plan by the state-run Taiwan Power Co.
(Taipower).</P>
      <P>The negotiators from the two sides, however, failed to reach any
agreement as of Thursday noon concerning a mammoth Taipower LNG
purchase plan for a proposed hydraulic power plant in central Taiwan
and a related project for an LNG receiving station.</P>
      <P>Australian LNG suppliers and exporters have long expressed
interest in the Taipower LNG purchase plan and have cooperated with
Dutch Shell to try to win the bid for the NT$400 billion contract.
There are several other multinational concerns that have entered the
bidding.</P>
      <P>Taipower is planning to build a four-megawatt hydraulic power
plant in Tahtan, central Taiwan, using LNG as fuel to generate the
power.</P>
      <P>The first generating unit of the Tahtan power plant is scheduled
to become operational in 2003 and some 1.73 million metric tons of
LNG are expected to be needed annually when the entire power plant is
completed and all its planned generating units are running, Taipower
officials who attended the two-day Taiwan-Australia Mineral and
Energy Conference said.</P>
      <P>The 25-year Taipower Tahtan LNG purchase contract, worth some
NT$400 billion (US$11.56 billion), is more attractive than building
two nuclear power plants in Taiwan, making it a key prospect for
world energy suppliers and bidders, including the Australian-Dutch
co-op, the French company Total Fina ELF, and U.S. oil giant Mobil.</P>
      <P>The Australian-Dutch team plans to obtain LNG in Australia and
sell the fossil fuel to Taiwan, while Total Fina ELF is said to be
cooperating with Taiwan's Far Eastern Group in its bid, and Mobil is
said to be sourcing LNG from Qatar, the Middle East, which it will
then sell to a Taiwan-based construction and energy company.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan construction and energy company, which is believed to
have been financed by Mobil, has obtained a development license from
the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) to build an LNG receiving
terminal on the coast of Taoyuan, northern Taiwan. The legality of
the development project has been questioned by foreign firms
associated with the bidding.</P>
      <P>The Australia-Dutch team has offered to build a movable LNG
receiving station anywhere offshore facing the northern Taiwan
counties of Taoyuan, Miaoli or Hsichu to facilitate the Taipower
Tahtan LNG purchase plan. The MOEA officials, nevertheless, have not
revealed their positions toward the idea.</P>
      <P>Taipower conducted its first open bid for the Tahtan LNG
purchases on Jan. 19 this year, but it was aborted because only two
companies participated in the bid, which is insufficient according to
the legal requirement of three bidders. The second such open bid is
scheduled to be held Aug. 16, Taipower officials said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the development of the Taipower LNG purchase plan,
MOEA officials who took part in the conference said the bids and all
related businesses will be conducted "openly and transparently."</P>
      <P>ROC Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Yin Chin-ming presided over
a ceremony at the Taiwan Power Building Wednesday to open the
conference.</P>
      <P>Fang Liang-chi, executive secretary of the Energy Commission
under the MOEA, and Tim Mackey, deputy executive director of the
Australian Ministry of Industrial and Scientific Resources, were key
negotiators representing Taiwan and Australia, respectively, during
the two-day conference.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou will invite
foreign businessmen in Taipei to attend a seminar later this month to
solicit their views on living and doing business in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma will listen to their views about Taipei's traffic, investment

administration. Both American and European chambers of commerce are
expected to attend.</P>
      <P>Richard Henson, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in
Taipei, has confirmed that he will attend the seminar.</P>
      <P>The European Chamber of Commerce in Taipei also said that many
problems faced by foreign businessmen in Taiwan are not related to
local governments, but it appreciates the Taipei City Government for
willing to listen to their views.</P>
      <P>It pointed out that foreign businessmen are generally positive
about the improvement of living and traffic conditions in Taipei over
the recent years, though they are reserved about its social order,
especially rampant occurrence of break-ins in Tienmu on the outskirts
of Taipei where many foreign businessmen live, adding that many of
them have the unhappy experience of being burglarized.</P>
      <P>Foreign businessmen said that Taipei will have to undergo
internationalization to become an international metropolis to attract
foreign investment. They cited the example of Wall Street in the
United States, saying that it is famous for its financial service,
and nobody would think of moving the manufacturing industry to New
York.</P>
      <P>They have, therefore, suggested that the future direction of

but in the service industry by creating a good investment

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MARKETING OF GERMAN ANTI-CHOLESTEROL DRUG HALTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  9  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Even as Taiwan's health authorities began
discussions about freezing a license to allow Bayer's
cholesterol-lowering medicine, Baycol, to be sold in Taiwan, the
German company's Taiwan operations decided Thursday to pull the plug
on the drug.</P>
      <P>Bayer announced Wednesday that it was stopping sales of Baycol,
also called cerivastatin, in very country except Japan, after reports
of muscle destruction linked to 31 U.S. deaths and at least nine more
fatalities around the world since the drug was first introduced in
1997.</P>
      <P>According to Hu You-pu, director of the Bureau of Medical Affairs
(BMA) under the Cabinet-level Department of Health, Bayer has spent a
year in Taiwan conducting human tests on Baycol.</P>
      <P>Without any cases of adverse side-effects being reported over the
past year, the BMA granted Bayer permission to sell the drug to
hospitals in Taiwan a month ago, Hu said.</P>
      <P>The marketing license for over-the-counter sales of Baycol,
however, has not yet been issued to Bayer, Taiwan, He added.</P>
      <P>Huang Yi-wen, a spokesman for Bayer, Taiwan, said Baycol was
originally scheduled to be officially introduced around the island in
October, but now the Taiwan marketing plan has been scrapped,
irrespective of what Taiwan health authorities decide regarding
licensing.</P>
      <P>Baycol is one of an extraordinarily popular family of drugs
called statins that dramatically lower cholesterol and reduce
patients' risk of heart attacks. Yet every statin has been linked to
very rare reports of the muscle side effect called rhabdomyolysis,

    <HEADLINE>CONSTRUCTION ON TAIWAN'S HIGH-SPEED RAILWAY PROCEEDING SMOOTHLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  9  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan High-Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC)
spokesman said Thursday that construction on the island's
much-anticipated high-speed rail system is proceeding smoothly and is
not expected to suffer any major delay in its inauguration.</P>
      <P>The spokesman was responding to a foreign wire service report
that the high-profile Taiwan and Japanese bullet train project to
link Taiwan's two biggest cities could face a setback due to gaps in
opinion between the two sides over design and other details.</P>
      <P>The report quoted unidentified Japanese sources as saying that
the THSRC and Japan's Taiwan Shinkansen Consortium (TSC) have agreed
on the model of the bullet train, but were stalled on the design of
the railway line.</P>
      <P>Those details, including format and materials, were supposed to
be agreed upon by the end of May, the Japanese sources said. As the
project has just begun, and if the two sides remain locked in a
wrangle over such basic matters, the Japanese sources said, it is
possible that the project could miss its October 2005 deadline.</P>
      <P>"We were baffled by the report," said the THSRC spokesman who
preferred to remain anonymous.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said THSRC and TSC executives and engineers have
met every month to exchange views on major contract provisions since
the two groups formally struck the NT$95 billion (US$2.9 billion)
deal on the new railway's core equipment and power system Dec. 12,
2000.</P>
      <P>"Communications between the two sides have been smooth," the
spokesman said, adding that there have been no major disagreements
over the basic design and format of Taiwan's first high-speed rail
project.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, bidding for all of the rail system's
12 civil construction projects have been finalized and boring for the
railway's first tunnel --- the Hsiashui Tunnel -- in Paoshan, Hsinchu
County was completed in May.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the spokesman said, a ceremony marking the finish of
tunneling work for the railway's second tunnel in Tunghsiao, Miaoli
County is scheduled to be held next Friday.</P>
      <P>At the moment, the spokesman said, the THSRC remains fully
confident that the new high-speed railway will be able to open to
traffic in October 2005 as originally scheduled.</P>
      <P>A CNA report from Tokyo also quoted TSC spokesman Toshihiko Nagao
as having said that the project is moving smoothly and there is no
major gap between the Japanese and Taiwanese sides concerning the
design and format of the rail system.</P>
      <P>TSC unexpectedly defeated the Alstom-Siemens Eurotrain consortium
in December 1999 to win exclusive negotiating rights for the THSRC's
core system and equipment contract.</P>
      <P>The Japanese consortium is formed by a number of major Japanese
trading and industrial companies, including Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries, Marubeni Crop., Mitsui Corp., Sumitomo Corp., Kawasaki
Heavy Industries and Toshiba Electric.</P>
      <P>The new rail system, with a price tag of NT$446 billion (US$12.85
billion), is designed to shorten the travel time between Taipei in
the north and Kaohsiung in the south. With a maximum speed of 300
kilometers per hour, a trip from Taipei to Kaohsiung with only a
single stop at Taichung will take about 90 minutes.</P>
      <P>It is the island's first infrastructure project built under a BOT
(build-operate-transfer) formula, under which private contractors are
authorized to build and operate the system for a fixed period, and
should then transfer the system to the government after the period
expires.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROMPT DECISION ON PERSONNEL RESHUFFLE AIMED AT AVOIDING CONFUSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's prompt decision
on a sweeping reshuffle of national security and military
intelligence personnel is mainly aimed at avoiding unnecessary
confusion, presidential aides said Thursday.</P>
      <P>In a swift but low-profile move, the Presidential Office
announced a major shake-up of the national security and military
intelligence agencies Wednesday evening.</P>
      <P>It was the largest-ever security and intelligence personnel
reshuffle since President Chen assumed office in the Republic of
China's first democratic transfer of power between different
political parties in May 2000.</P>
      <P>After more than a year of observation, presidential aides said,
President Chen has become fully aware of the merits and flaws of
various national security and military intelligence agencies.</P>
      <P>"Against this backdrop, it's logical for Chen to make some
personnel adjustments," a close aide said, adding that the quick,
low-profile approach was designed to avert speculation and confusion.</P>
      <P>There has been speculation about a possible military,
intelligence and national security personnel reshuffle in recent
weeks, causing difficulties for senior military officers, including
Minister of National Defense Wu Shih-wen and Chief of the General
Staff Tang Yao-ming.</P>
      <P>But sources close to Chen said although intelligence and security
agencies have close working relationships with the military, the
latest security and intelligence personnel reshuffle does not
necessarily imply that the military leadership would also undergo a
shake-up.</P>
      <P>In the latest personnel reshuffle, National Security Bureau (NSB)
Director Ting Yu-chou will be promoted to the post of
secretary-general of the National Security Council (NSC), which
oversees NSB operations.</P>
      <P>Incumbent NSC Secretary-General Chuang Ming-yao, a former navy
commander-in-chief, will become president of the Association of East
Asian Relations -- a semi-official organization in charge of
exchanges with Japan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties between
the two countries.</P>
      <P>Ting's vacated position will be filled by his deputy, Tsai
Chao-ming.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsu Chu-sheng, head of the Military Intelligence
Bureau, will be replaced by Hsueh Shih-ming, commanding general of
the Kinmen Defense Command.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's bid to join the
United Nations is by no means aimed at challenging mainland China's
seat in the world body, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Wu Tzu-dan
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks after 10 of the ROC's diplomatic allies
presented a joint proposal to the U.N. Secretariat Wednesday urging
the U.N. General Assembly to set up a working panel to examine
Taiwan's "exceptional international situation" and its desire for
representation in the United Nations and its affiliated agencies.</P>
      <P>Wu said the ROC highly appreciates its allies' presentation of
the proposal without yielding to threat and intimidation from
mainland China, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.</P>
      <P>The 10 countries are Belize, Burkina Faso, Chad, Dominica, El Salvador, 
Gambia, Nicaragua, Palau, Senegal and Tuvalu.</P>
      <P>The ROC, a U.N. founding members, has been shut out of the
United Nations since 1971 when the world body gave the China seat
to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Wu said the expulsion has created major obstacles to the
ROC government and its 23 million people.</P>
      <P>"We hope the U.N. General Assembly will consider our people's
common desire for a representation in the United Nations and its
affiliated agencies," Wu said.</P>
      <P>The veteran diplomat also urged mainalnd China to face up to
the reality of the ROC's continued existence in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu reminded mainland Chinese leaders that their continued
diplomatic embargo against the ROC would only draw a backlash from
the people of Taiwan and thus hinder improvement of relations across
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Wu further called on other U.N. members to pay heed to the
legitimacy of the ROC's U.N. bid and throw support behind the
proposal to set up a panel to study Taiwan's membership
bid.</P>
      <P>In their joint proposal, the 10 ROC allies urged the U.N.
General Assembly to form a special working group to study Taiwan's
U.N. bid and invite ROC representatives to take part in the working
panel to facilitate its work.</P>
      <P>The proposal also urged the U.N. General Assembly and the
international community to express more concern about the
development in cross-strait relations and to encourage both sides
to resume dialogue.</P>
      <P>Since 1992, the ROC has annually asked the U.N. General Assembly
through its diplomatic allies to tackle issues regarding Taiwan's
representation in the world body. However, its bid had consistently
been shot down at the U.N. Steering Committee meeting and failed to
make the General Assembly agenda due to mainland China's opposition.</P>
      <P>It remains unclear whether the proposal can make the General
Assembly agenda this year As the Steering Committee has yet to
discuss the issue.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The 2001 International Software Show kicked
off in Taipei Thursday with the participation of nearly 200 software
companies manning 600 display booths.</P>
      <P>At the opening of the annual software show, which is in its 12th
year, Vice Premier Lai In-jaw reiterated the government's
determination to make various government services more convenient and
effective by bringing them online.</P>
      <P>He handed out awards to the government agencies whose Web sites
were judged to be exemplary. A total of 53 Web sites out of 311
entries won a coveted honor.</P>
      <P>The five-day event, free to the public and organized by the
Information Service Industry Association (ISIA) of the Republic of
China, is expected to draw over 200,000 visitors.</P>
      <P>ISIA Chairman James Wong said that the software industry can be
said to be the yardstick among all knowledge-based industries.</P>
      <P>Despite global and local economic sluggishness, he went on,
Taiwan's information software industry has continued to grow at 20
percent to 30 percent each year, with current annual production
already surpassing the NT$100 billion (US$2.9 billion) mark.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that during the past three months alone, over 60
newly established software companies have joined the ISIA, with over
half of them capitalized at over NT$100 million (US$2.9 million).</P>
      <P>Because the software industry has continued to grow, it will
create 8,000 to 10,000 additional jobs per year, he added.</P>
      <P>The Institute for Information Industry has predicted that the
local software industry's annual production will reach NT$200 billion
(US$5.8 billion) in 2002 and NT$400 billion (US$11.5 billion) in
2005.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 6,000 overseas mainland Chinese are
now residing in North Korea and over the 95 percent of them are
farmers and laborers, the semi-official Korean Trade Promotion Corp.
(KOTRA) quoted a mainland Chinese newspaper as reporting Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the "Liaoning Korean Newspaper," all the overseas
Chinese in North Korea had become farmers or laborers as a result of
the socialism reform measures adopted by the North Korean regime in
1950.</P>
      <P>The adoption of socialism by North Korean authorities in 1950
forced those overseas Chinese who worked in handicraft manufacturing,
ran groceries or restaurants to immediately take up work as farmers
thus damaging the economy.</P>
      <P>The majority of overseas Chinese now in North Korea who retained
their mainland Chinese nationality came from Shantung province, it
reported.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KOTRA reported that most overseas Chinese in North
Korea lived a middle class existence and were better off than their
North Korean compatriots. They enjoyed an 11-year compulsory
educational system and receive free medical care and tax exemptions.
The North Korean government has also subsidized them for food,
housing and utilities.</P>
      <P>At present, more than 100 overseas Chinese students from North
Korea are studying in colleges and universities in mainland China,
KOTRA reported.</P>
      <P>More than 60,000 overseas Chinese had been living in North Korea
when the Second World War ended. The majority of overseas Chinese
returned to mainland China when the Korean War broke out in 1950.</P>

      <P>Construction work on a NT$30 billion
"dream mall" is under way after a ground-breaking ceremony held
Thursday in the southern Taiwan city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The ceremony was jointly presided over by UNI-President
Enterprises Corp. Chairman Kao Ching-yuan, Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh
and Kaohsiung City Council Speaker Huang Chi-chuan, with more than
200 representatives from enterprises around Taiwan and abroad
witnessing the event.</P>
      <P>In an address, Kao expressed hope that the planned
multifunctional business center, with support from the Kaohsiung city
government, will provide 15,000 jobs for the people in southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The project will be divided into three phases, with the first
described as the largest shopping mall in Taiwan. The second and
third phases will comprise residential and office buildings, as well
as tourist hotels.</P>
      <P>The mall is expected to attract 25 million customers annually and
bring in about NT$20 billion in annual revenue, according to an
official from UNI-President, the project's investor.</P>
      <P>Hsieh expressed his thanks to the President group for its

    <HEADLINE>LCD MONITORS, DIGITAL CAMERAS LEAD GROWTH AMIDST OVERALL DECLINE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  9  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Institute for Information Industry
announced Thursday that local production of LCD monitors and digital
cameras are both expected to grow immensely from last year amidst an
overall decline in the information hardware industry.</P>
      <P>Chan Wen-nan, director of the institute's Market Intelligence
Center (MIC), said that the actual production of LCD monitors from
January to June hit 2.9 million units, an increase of 168.7 percent
from the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>He added that the MIC predicts that the growth momentum will
continue in the second half of the year so that total annual
production for LCD monitors in 2001 will hit 8.4 million units, a
188.8 percent increase from last year.</P>
      <P>Production value-wise, the MIC predicted that LCD monitors will
bring in US$3.141 billion, an annual increase of 66 percent.</P>
      <P>Chan said that the local LCD monitor industry is expected to
continue growing in leaps and bounds in 2002, with an estimated total
annual production of 23 million units worth nearly US$8 billion.</P>
      <P>Turning to digital cameras, the MIC predicted that total annual
production for 2001 will surpass 10 million units, an annual increase
of 86.3 percent over last year.</P>
      <P>Production value-wise, that volume is expected to translate into
a 147.5 percent growth, reaping in US$1.4 billion, Chan said.</P>
      <P>He added that digital cameras from Taiwan are expected to make up
44.5 percent of the global market in 2001, an increase from 37.3
percent last year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the MIC predicted that production for other locally
manufactured information hardware will post declines this year.</P>
      <P>Production of Taiwan-made notebook computers, which comprised
52.5 percent of the world market last year, are expected to grow 3
percent in 2001 to 13 million units, but the equivalent production
value -- estimated at US$12 billion -- will mark an 11 percent
decrease from last year.</P>
      <P>Affected by fierce competition from South Korea, conventional CDT
monitors are expected to decline 18.9 percent in total production to
48 million units worth US$5.4 billion, a 34.5 percent decrease from
2000.</P>
      <P>The MIC predicted that local production of desktop computers will
grow by 2.4 percent to hit 28.3 million units this year, which
translates into a total value of US$7 billion, a 9.2 percent decrease
from last year.</P>
      <P>Motherboard production is expected to reach 80 million units,
down 3.7 percent from last year, with a total value of US$5.3 billion
-- 5.5 percent lower than 2000.</P>
      <P>CD-ROM drive production is expected to decline by 2 percent to 58
million units, bringing in an estimated US$2.3 billion -- 0.1 percent
more than last year.</P>
      <P>Despite Taiwan's 92 percent dominance in the global scanner
market, production of local scanners is expected to slide to 22

      <P>The Republic of China's top economic policy
planner said Thursday that he supports the idea that foreign
laborers' wages should no longer be subject to the minimum wage
requirement enjoyed by their local counterparts.</P>
      <P>Chen Poh-chih, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD), was responding to a suggestion by a
presidential policy coordination panel, which was asked by President
Chen Shui-bian to study ways to reduce foreign labor costs for local
entrepreneurs.</P>
      <P>The president has been very concerned about the fact that foreign
labor costs in Taiwan are behind only South Korea, but 2.79 times
those of Singapore and 1.42 times those of Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The economic policy planner also complained the exorbitant labor
brokerage fees paid by foreign workers do no good to neither
employers nor the foreign workers and added that a better policy
should be planned to benefit both sides.</P>
      <P>He said he supports the idea that foreign workers will no longer
be subject to minimum wage requirements as stipulated in the
country's Labor Standards Law and that the market should decide the
wages.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the move will violate "national treatment," Chen
said he sees no such problem, adding that it is quite natural that
salaries should vary in different industries. Besides, he went on,
the ROC government has never been discriminatory toward security in
the workplace, health, or basic human rights of its foreign workers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Amid the global economic recession hitting
the hi-tech sector, business revenues of Taiwan's traditional
industries based in export processing zones (EPZs) have gone against
the trend by posting increases, the EPZ Administration said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to administration officials, the business revenue of
Taiwan's EPZs totaled NT$183.9 billion in the first seven months of
this year, down 11.62 percent from the same period of 2000. However,
the overall business revenue of EPZ-based traditional industries,
which accounts for 10 percent of the total EPZ revenue, grew to
NT$11.99 billion during the same period.</P>
      <P>For instance, the officials said, the chemical and plastics
industry saw a rise in business revenue of 18.83 percent
year-on-year, while the food processing industry and the machinery
industry experienced growth of 26.24 percent and 8.38 percent,
respectively.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the officials went on, IC-related, information
industry-related and optical and electronics firms based in the EPZs
-- which contribute 75.6 percent of the EPZs' total business revenue
-- posted large declines in operational income, while EPZ-based
traditional small- and medium-sized businesses made a great
contribution to Taiwan's economy and have in turn become a stabilizer
in the present economic slump.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FALUN GONG IN CANADA URGES GOV'T TO EXPEL VISITING PRC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Aug.  9  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Falun Gong practitioners in Canada have
urged the federal government to expel or charge a visiting
Communist Chinese official suspected of aiding in the suppression of
Falun Gong followers in mainland China.</P>
      <P>The Falun Dafa Association of Canada, along with Canadian
citizens Mrs. Jinyu Li and Mr. Xueye Zhu, was referring to Dong
Yiming, a department chief of the Appeal Processing Office of
Communist China's National Appeal Bureau, who is currently visiting
Toronto.</P>
      <P>They accuse Dong of being "directly responsible, instrumental and
complicit in the systematic murder, torture, persecution and illegal
labor camp internment of thousands of Falun Dafa practitioners in
China."</P>
      <P>Li and Zhu, who claim they are victims of Dong's actions, said
they plan to confront him during his brief stay and public
appearances in Canada.</P>
      <P>They claim that Dong's entry into Canada is a clear breach of the
Immigration Act and that his actions, which constitute crimes against
humanity, are a criminal offense under the Criminal Act of Canada.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Falun Gong practitioners in Canada are embarking on a
nationwide "SOS! Urgent: Rescue the Falun Gong Practitioners
Persecuted in China" tour. They will head to cities and towns in each
of Canada's provinces and territories during August and September to
raise awareness and gather support for their cause.</P>
      <P>They will seek to gather signatures for a petition asking the
Canadian government to help release the husband of Jinyu Li, who has
been held in a Chinese labor camp for the last 18 months, to help
rescue practitioners persecuted in mainland China, and to coordinate
a team for an international investigation into the persecution of the
Falun Gong by Beijing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRC'S ARREST, RELEASE OF AMERICANS `HOSTAGE DIPLOMACY:' U.S. SENATOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  9  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Senate Democratic leader Tom
Daschle on Thursday called Communist China's recent arrest and
release of Americans "hostage diplomacy, and not a sign of
improvement in the way China treats its people."</P>
      <P>In a speech titled "A New Century of American Leadership," the
South Dakota Democrat noted that "we need to recognize that it is in
our national interest to help our former adversaries, like Russia and
China, build a pluralistic society tied to the West."</P>
      <P>Sen. Daschle said the 20th century in many ways was "the story of
our triumph over two great and pernicious adversaries, Nazism and
communism. Today we do not need a great adversary to be a great
country. Unfortunately, some don't accept this reality. And with the
collapse of the Soviet Union, they would like to see China take its
place."</P>
      <P>"I believe we need to take a more nuanced view. China is a nation
at a crossroads. Today, China is in the midst of a sweeping economic
reform. Although democracy is growing at the local level, China still
has a sordid record on human rights and still has not guaranteed the
right to worship, to speak, or to choose one's leaders," he added.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that "the release of our visiting scholars, while
welcome news, was not an exception" to the mainland Chinese
government's record of lack of respect for human rights.</P>
      <P>The senator said the question for the United States therefore is:
"How do we get China to embrace the norms of international behavior,
including the rule of law?"</P>
      <P>"We don't do it by abandoning the kind of frank and open exchange
that allows us to raise our differences in the first place or by
trying to isolate a nation with 1.2 billion people and a nuclear
arsenal capable of reaching targets in the United States or by
turning our backs on what could develop into one of the world's
largest economies," he explained.</P>
      <P>"We have to engage China, even as we challenge China on key areas
of difference. It is in America's clear national security interest to
do so. It is in America's vital economic interest to do so. And in
the long run, it is the only way to help bring freedom and reform to
the people of China," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FIVE-YEAR-OLD BECOMES TAIWAN'S YOUNGEST AUTHOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A five-year-old boy named Duoduo (Donald)
recently had his first book published, becoming Taiwan's youngest
author.</P>
      <P>By launching on Thursday the book "I'm 5, My English is Better
Than Yours," co-authored by Duoduo and his marketing
manager-turned-housewife mother Chu Ching-yu (Mary), the child
unleashed the "Duoduo legend" in Taiwan. Duoduo was born to Taiwanese
parents who have never lived in an English-speaking country.</P>
      <P>The "Duoduo" book, which began to appear on shelves at bookstores
around the island Thursday, contains a number of forward articles
written by adults who express their amazement at the fact that Donald
has learned more than 3,000 English words by the tender age of 5.</P>
      <P>One of the forwards was written by Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, a
Harvard-trained law specialist who speaks fluent English. Apparently
impressed by Duoduo's abilities, Ma wrote that in order "to learn
English and learn well, better begin early."</P>
      <P>Duoduo initially showed a little bit of shyness and "boredom" at
the party hosted by the publisher marking the launch of the book, but
he become more cheerful when he began playing spelling games with
reporters.</P>
      <P>When asked by Liao Su Si-zi, owner of the locally-renowned
Shinseo Bookstore, why he could memorize so many English words at
such a young age, Duoduo answered matter-of-factly that "you remember
them after repeating them many many times."</P>
      <P>Duoduo's mother, Mary, who gave up her well-paying job as a
marketing manager at a Taipei publication company to become a
full-time housewife and "mentor" to Duoduo, said the boy has been
"using" and "playing with" the English language, rather than
"studying" it -- thereby enabling him to memorize in a fun way more
than 3,000 English words and phrases in only about one-and-a-half
years.</P>
      <P>Mary said all she has done is to try to create an "English
environment" for her son, exposing him to the language as much as
possible, such as by buying him English books, only tuning to
English-speaking television channels and radio programs, and playing
simple words games like "pictionary" or charades with him.</P>
      <P>Despite his young age, Duoduo is exceptionally "shrewd". When his
mother asked him when exactly he plans to compile his own English
dictionary, as the publisher had asked, Duoduo replied by saying
"Don't even think about it. There will be no second book."</P>
      <P>After playing spelling games with reporters, Duoduo was asked by
his mother if it would be okay for him to answer some questions from
the reporters. Duoduo responded, also in English, by saying "just a
second." Then, after a few moments, said "now they can ask, but only
questions related to English."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hsueh Shih-ming took over as the new head
of the Military Intelligence Bureau Friday in the first wave of a
reshuffle of national security and military intelligence personnel
announced by the Presidential Office earlier this week.</P>
      <P>Hseuh took over the post from Hsu Chu-sheng, who will serve as
inspector general in the Navy General Headquarters, in a changeover
ceremony presided over by Chief of the General Staff Tang Yao-ming.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Tang flew over to the offshore island of
Kinmen to present Hsueh with a medal in recognition of his
contributions over the past 13 months as the commanding general
of Kinmen Defense Command.</P>
      <P>Tang also took the opportunity to remind military personnel not
to harbor false hopes about peace in the Taiwan Strait after
Beijing's successful bid for the 2008 Olympics in early July and to
remain vigilant and step up combat preparedness in order to ensure
national security.</P>
      <P>He also said that although the domestic economy has been
sluggish, national security is still paramount, vowing to solicit a
pay raise for military personnel so as to attract more intelligent
young people to join the military.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen Defense Command head vacancy is expected to be filled
by Aug. 16. It has been learned that Lt. Gen. Hu Cheng-pu, deputy
chief of the Chief of General Staff for Operations, and Lt. Gen. Wang
Keng-lin, commandant of Infantry School, are the candidates under
consideration.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN URGES BEIJING TO ACCEPT REALITY OF HIS POSITION AS ROC PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that
the mainland Chinese leadership should accept the reality of his
position as president of the Republic of China to facilitate solving
the "one China" dispute between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with U.S. Senator Christopher
Bond (R-Mo.), who arrived in Taipei Thursday for a two-day visit.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ROC Constitution has set a tone for resolving the
cross-strait "one China" dispute. "It is the best answer for dealing
with the `one China' issue for the governments and people of both
sides of the Taiwan Strait," he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that he was elected by the people of Taiwan as president
of the ROC in accordance with the ROC Constitution, Chen said he
hopes mainland China accepts him as the ROC's head of state.</P>
      <P>"If mainland China were to decline to accept this reality, it
would violate the ROC Constitution. Not only me, but also the 23
million people of Taiwan could not accept such a scenario," Chen
said.</P>
      <P>The president told his guest that since he assumed office, he has
given priority to promoting cross-strait rapprochement. "I have
seized every possible opportunity to extend an olive branch to
Beijing. I have not only hoped to resume cross-strait dialogue but
have also intended to forge reconciliation, cooperation and permanent
peace with mainland China," he explained.</P>
      <P>In his view, Chen said, the informal leadership meeting of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum to be held in Shanghai
in late October provides a good setting for the top leaders of the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait to meet.</P>
      <P>Chen said he has on many occasions expressed his strong desire to
attend the forthcoming APEC summit meeting in person. "Since the ROC
is an APEC member, its president has the legitimate right to attend
the APEC summit," he noted.</P>
      <P>APEC, a regional economic cooperation forum, is one of the few
international organizations which simultaneously accepts both
mainland China and Taiwan as members. However, because of Beijing's
opposition, the ROC president has been barred from personally
attending the annual APEC leadership meeting in the past. As a
result, the ROC head of state has had to name a proxy to take part in
the event on his behalf. Chen named Central Bank of China Governor
Perng Fai-nan to attend the 2000 APEC summit in Brunei.</P>
      <P>Mainland China insists that Taiwan accept its version of the "one
China" principle as a prerequisite to resuming the long-stalled
cross-strait dialogue. However, Chen's administration has said that
Beijing's "one China" principle is unacceptable because it downgrades
the ROC to a local-level government under Beijing's jurisdiction.</P>

a lack of cross-strait exchanges, MAC Vice Chairman Chen Ming-tung
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Taiwan has always hoped that both sides of the
Taiwan Strait can sit down together to discuss cross-strait
exchanges, adding that before such meetings can take place, the MAC
is willing to have interest groups and those concerned about
cross-strait relations act as go-betweens.</P>
      <P>Chen, at a regular MAC press conference, also said that if the
Economic Development Advisory Conference reaches consensus on opening
Taiwan to mainland Chinese tourists, the government will definitely
implement the policy.</P>
      <P>The government had earlier planned on opening the island up to
mainland tourists beginning July 1 this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LABOR AFFAIRS OFFICIAL INSISTS ON MAINTAINING MINIMUM WAGE REQUIREMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 10 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Labor affairs officials have insisted that
the minimum wage requirement under the Labor Standards Law must not
be abolished and that in times of economic recession, the level
should be adjusted downward to reflect the economic environment.</P>
      <P>Chen Chu, chairman of the Council of Labor Affairs under the
Executive Yuan, stated the position of the council in response to
suggestions by economic officials to abolish the minimum wage
requirement for the sake of local business and industry's
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Chen Po-chih, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD), suggested Thursday that foreign laborers should
not be included in the minimum wage requirement in view of the fact
that employers of foreign laborers in Taiwan pay much higher
personnel costs as compared with other countries.</P>
      <P>CEPD Vice Chairman K.C. Lee, supporting Chen's argument, said
some 99 percent of Taiwan's local laborers work at jobs where they
are paid much more than the minimum wage of NT$15,840 (about US$460)
per month and that the requirement has become mainly a protection for
foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>Lee added that in times of economic recession, it is reasonable
to abolish the minimum wage requirement and provide employers with
more flexibility in recruiting employees.</P>
      <P>Labor affairs officials insist that the minimum wage requirement
must be maintained and that the minimum wage level can be adjusted in
accordance with the economic climate.</P>
      <P>Since the minimum wage requirement came into force in 1956, the
minimum wage has been adjusted upward 18 times and has never been
adjusted downward, according to statistics compiled by the Ministry
of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>The minimum wage has remained at NT$15,840 since 1997 when
business and industry voiced strong opposition to a further upward
adjustment.</P>
      <P>Labor officials said that an upward adjustment is unlikely this
year and that in consideration of the current economic climate, a
downward adjustment might be made.</P>

    <HEADLINE>`LET THE MOUNTAINS REPLENISH,' ACADEMICS  URGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should begin to let the mountains
replenish themselves and suspend all economic activities on them,
including tourism, a group of academics urged Friday.</P>
      <P>At a press conference, dubbed "Bear in Mind the Lessons of
Typhoon Toraji and Face the Warnings from Mother Nature," the
academics said Taiwan's green land, which covers about two-thirds of
the island and is mostly mountainous, has been gradually turned into
soil-depleting betel nut orchards.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Environmental Protection Union (TEPU), an activist
group comprised mainly of professors from National Taiwan University
(NTU), hosted the press conference in the wake of the devastating
Typhoon Toraji, which killed some 100 people and left 110 others
unaccounted for, mainly as a result of floods and mudslides triggered
by the storm.</P>
      <P>NTU forestation professor Chen Hsin-hsiung blamed over-farming
and over-development as the main culprits of the mudslides and
related destruction that the latest typhoon wrought on central and
eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said Typhoon Toraji brought a tremendous 900 millimeters of
rainfall to mountainous Nantou County, a factor that many people
pinpointed as the culprit of the disaster suffered by the central
Taiwan county.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, he pointed out, rainfall reached an even
more threatening level of 1,100 millimeters in the same area in 1959,
but the natural disasters triggered by that rainfall were much less
severe.</P>
      <P>Chiu Chang-ping, an adviser to the TEPU and formerly an NTU
professor of civil engineering, put the blame for increasingly
frequent mudslides in central Taiwan in recent years on the
development of the New Cross-Island Highway that cuts through the
heart of virgin mountains in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Apart from the destruction that the development of the
cross-island highway has brought to the surrounding environment, the
opening of the road paved the way for profiteers, leading them
directly into deep mountains where they started "high added-value"
plantations such as betel nuts, fruit, tea and mountain vegetables,
encroaching inch-by-inch on the virgin mountain areas, Chiu added.</P>
      <P>In addition, he noted, clandestine deforestation has been so
rampant in the mountainous areas that it is reported that it takes
only half an hour for the "mountain thieves" to load a truck of
illegally logged timber and drive it down from the mountains.</P>
      <P>Chiu lamented that every time a mudslide occurs, the government
hurries to rescue the victims and repair the roads and land, but
gives little thought to improving water conservation and other
conservation efforts that would help consolidate the unstable areas.</P>
      <P>This, he explained, is why roads, bridges and other
infrastructure facilities are repaired but break again as soon as a
new flood or typhoon strikes.</P>
      <P>Chiu suggested that Taiwan's mountains be allowed to enter a
"hibernation" period to allow the land to replenish itself, adding
that even tourism should be halted in unstable areas.</P>
      <P>Chen Man-li, chairwoman of the Homemakers' Union and Foundation,
urged during the press conference that President Chen Shui-bian
announce 2001 as the inaugural year of environmental protection in
Taiwan and that he instruct all Cabinet-level agencies, as well as
government at all levels, to conserve the environment, instead of
leaving the job solely to the under-funded and under-supported
Environmental Protection Administration.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
will cooperate with the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) to lower the
restrictions on businessmen from mainland China wishing to visit
Taiwan, officials with the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said Friday.</P>
      <P>BOFT officials said the present measures allow only those
mainland Chinese businessmen who have actually bought locally made
products to travel to Taiwan to take part in relevant meetings, tours
and related activities, such as product inspections.</P>
      <P>In the face of the increased trade and economic exchanges between
the two sides, however, it is necessary to relax the present measures
to facilitate visits to Taiwan by mainland Chinese buyers as a means
of helping generate greater purchase from the mainland, they noted.</P>
      <P>Ideas being studied include slashing a combined lowest purchase
requirement level by mainland Chinese businesses to Taiwan-based
firms from US$500,000 to US$200,000 over three years, lowering the
lowest level for sole purchase missions from US$200,000 to US$100,000
and removing the requirement that visits to Taiwan by mainland
businessmen are only permitted for carrying out quality control
missions here, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>MOEA statistics show that a total of 672 mainland Chinese
visitors came to Taiwan to purchase and inspect product quality last
year, accounting for only 10.5 percent of the total number of people
permitted to visit for trade or economic activities.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Only 6 percent of the jobs in Taiwan allow
flexible working hours, a percentage that is much lower than in some
other countries, according to a report compiled by the National
Science Council of the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The recently released report indicates that women workers
dropping out of the workforce to tend their families generally have
difficulty finding employment later. Jobs with flexible working hours
that would allow working mothers to juggle family and career are hard
to find.</P>
      <P>The same report points out that many employees in the private
sector have turned to family businesses because of the economic
recession. These people usually remain self-employed even when the
economic prospects take a turn for the better, according to the
report.</P>
      <P>The report also says there is evidence that many firms tend to
lay off senior employees to avoid paying their pensions. Under the
Labor Standards Law, an employee is entitled to apply for retirement
and a pension after having served a company or agency for 25 years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN EXPERIMENTING WITH STEM CELL TREATMENT FOR PARKINSON'S DISEASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan scientists have begun experimenting
with embryonic stem cell treatment of Parkinson's disease, local
researchers announced Friday.</P>
      <P>They made the remarks after U.S. President George W. Bush
announced Thursday that he will allow federally funded research into
embryonic stem cells on a limited basis, in a compromise decision
that ended months of sometimes agonized soul searching in the United
States.</P>
      <P>Lin Hsin-jung, director of the neurosurgery department of the
Tri-Service General Hospital, said he managed to obtain Department of
Health (DOH) permission several years ago to experiment with
embryonic stem cell treatment of Parkinson's disease.</P>
      <P>Lin said his research team has injected stem cells harvested from
miscarried human embryos into the brains of patients with Parkinson's
disease, a severe ailment that causes muscles to become weak and the
limbs to shake.</P>
      <P>"We have injected stem cells into the area of the brain that
controls muscle movement, where the disease kills nerve cells, with a
view to regenerating the neurons and reversing the illness," Lin
explained.</P>
      <P>To date, Lin said, such embryonic stem cell transplants have not
been successful in curing the disease. "But the therapeutic effects
of the stem cell transplants can compete with surgical therapy," he
noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin said he has also filed an application with the DOH
for clinical experiments involving the transplant of striate cells
from embryonic stem cells into the brains of patients with
Huntington's chorea, a rare inherited disease of the central nervous
system characterized by progressive dementia, abnormal posture and
involuntary movements.</P>
      <P>Lin said his research team has already completed clinical trials
on animals. "We'll begin clinical experiments on humans after
receiving DOH approval," he added.</P>
      <P>Shih Tzu-pi, director of the Graduate Institute of Cell and
Molecular Biology of Taipei Medical University, said that as
embryonic stem cells have the ability to transform themselves into
virtually any other type of cell in the body, scientists hope to
harness the transformational qualities of stem cells to provide
treatments for a variety of diseases affecting millions of people
worldwide.</P>
      <P>"Many scientists believe stem cells can be used in treating brain
maladies like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, as well as
diabetes, heart attacks, strokes and spinal injuries," he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that stem cells are primitive cells which have the ability
to transform themselves into many other types of cells, Shih said
they offer the potential of regenerating damaged organs or tissue.</P>
      <P>The DOH has not yet allowed stem cell plantation as a regular
medical treatment, but several private companies, including Yuen
Foong Yu Group, have introduced umbilical cord stem cell storage
services. With the concept of "biological insurance" becoming
increasingly popular in the United States, those firms believe that
stem cell storage services will also have great market potential in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shih noted that after the birth of a child, the umbilical cord is
basically medical waste. "But stem cells harnessed from umbilical
cords might have promising therapeutic effects. Moreover,
self-transplantation of stem cells can avoid the problems of
rejection. Therefore, storing umbilical cord stem cells may offer
much promise for treatments of one's own diseases in the future," he
added.</P>

      <P>Six Nobel Peace Prize winners, 14
congressmen and parliamentarians from the United States and Japan,
and the heads of 11 international NGOs, have been invited to Taipei
next week to participate in a campaign for world peace initiated by
Republic of China Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>Lu said that Taiwan has no reason to be pessimistic about itself
because the fact that so many international figures have been invited
to come to the island on such short notice reveals the degree of
international support for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is not a trouble-maker, but a peace-maker," Lu added.</P>
      <P>The series of activities are scheduled to begin Aug. 14, when Lu
will accompany the guests on a trip to the frontline ROC island of
Kinmen and host a banquet in their honor in the evening.</P>
      <P>A "World Peace Forum" will be convened Aug. 15-16 with the theme
"Creating Eternal Peace in the Taiwan Strait." Former ROC President

    <HEADLINE>RESIDENCY QUOTA FOR MAINLAND CHINESE SPOUSES TO BE FURTHER EASED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official
promised Friday that the annual quota for mainland Chinese spouses
allowed to settle in Taiwan will be further increased next year.</P>
      <P>Liu Teh-hsun, director of the MAC's department of legal affairs,
made the promise at a public hearing organized by opposition New
Party Legislator Lai Shyh-bao on the many restrictions faced by
mainlanders who have married Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>At present, the Republic of China government grants permanent
residency to 3,600 mainland Chinese spouses annually. This quota has
not been adjusted for three years due to a freeze imposed by the
Legislative Yuan, but as it will expire at the end of this year, Liu
said, the MAC has begun considering raising the residency quota.</P>
      <P>Lai said at the public hearing that mainland Chinese brides have
to wait for many years before they can secure residency permits in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he went on, mainland Chinese spouses face stringent
work restrictions. "The government should ease all those restrictions
in line with the general world human rights trends," the outspoken
lawmaker added.</P>
      <P>More than 100 mainland Chinese brides and their spouses attended
the hearing. Wang Jing, a mainland bride from Hubei, urged the ROC
government to ease job restrictions on mainland spouses. "I hope to
work to help my family make ends meet, as my husband's salary is not
enough to finance the living expenses of my in-laws and our
children," she complained.</P>
      <P>Representatives of the private Cross-Strait Marriage Coordination
Association presented many proposals for improving the treatment of
mainland spouses, including allowing them to travel directly across
the Taiwan Strait via the ROC's frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu
to help ease their financial burden, and allowing those who have been
married to local people for a year to apply for permanent residency
on the island.</P>
      <P>In response, Liu said the MAC will heed the mainland spouses'
petitions and will take steps to ease certain restrictions based on
humanitarian grounds.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland
China, will launch a "growth camp" program next week to help mainland
Chinese spouses adapt themselves to the lifestyle and social customs
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The program, to kick off Tuesday, will offer Taiwanese dialect
teaching, legal counseling, health knowledge, first-aid training and
parenting courses.</P>
      <P>This will be the first time that the MAC has offered the training
program for mainland Chinese spouses.</P>
      <P>According to MAC tallies, the number of cross-strait marriages
has exceeded 100,000 and the number of mainland spouses allowed to
settle in Taiwan has also increased rapidly.</P>
      <P>"Against this background, we have decided to organize specially
designed training programs for mainland Chinese spouses to help them
cope with family and legal problems," said an MAC official.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PREMIER TO VISIT FOUR CARIBBEAN ALLIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Government Information Office (GIO)
confirmed Friday that Premier Chang Chun-hsiung will visit four
Caribbean states between Aug.31 and Sept. 12.</P>
      <P>The GIO said in a press release that Chang will visit St. Vincent
and the Grenadines to mark the 20th anniversary of the establishment
of ties between the two countries and will then visit St.
Christopher, Dominica and Grenada.</P>
      <P>It will be Chang's first overseas visit since he took office Oct.
4 last year.</P>
      <P>The GIO press release said leaders of the four Caribbean allies
have already visited Taiwan and have invited Chang to visit their
states in return.</P>
      <P>In order to save on travel costs, the press release went on,
Chang will be accompanied by only about ten Cabinet ministers and
business leaders.</P>
      <P>In light of a United Nations assembly scheduled to open Sept. 11
in New York, Chang will ask the four states to continue their support
for Taiwan's bids to rejoin the U.N.</P>
      <P>Chang's itinerary will be announced after details have been
worked out with the host countries, said the press release.</P>
      <P>Chang's chief of staff Chiou I-jen said Friday that Chang is
making the trip mainly because of the invitation from St. Vincent and
the Grenadines Premier James Mitchell, who requested Chang's presence
to mark the 20th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties
between the two counties.</P>
      <P>Mitchell put forward the invitation some two months ago before
Taiwan was ravaged by Typhoon Toraji, which claimed the lives of more
than 100 and Chiou said the island's rescue work is already on the
track, while diplomacy is also a vital part of the premier's job.</P>
      <P>Although Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao is expected to visit the
region Aug. 27, it would be impolite to have him take Chang's place
on this occasion, since the invitation was extended to Chang, Chiou
said.</P>
      <P>Once the premier is in the region, there would be no reason not
to drop in on the other three states, of which are Taiwan's close
allies, said Chiou.</P>
      <P>Chiou offered the reasoning behind Chang's trip in response to
criticism by the local China Times newspaper, which described the
trip as inappropriate, given that the island is still reeling from
the effects of Toraji.</P>
      <P>What is more, the China Times said, Chang's trip is a waste of
the nation's resources at a time when the government is tightening
its belt to cope with its mounting debts.</P>
      <P>The paper pointed out that Tien will meet his counterparts from
all four Caribbean states in Grenada Aug. 27.</P>
      <P>Tien has dropped planned visits to St. Vincent and the Grenadines
because of Chang's visit, and will travel instead to Porto Rico.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 10 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Premier Vincent Siew proposed Friday
that Taiwan should focus on playing the roles of a research and
development innovation center and a global logistics center in order
to save the local economy.</P>
      <P>A vice chairman of the presidential Economic Development Advisory
Conference (EDAC), Siew said at a seminar on Taiwan's economic
prospects that he will unveil his full assessment on the economy in
the upcoming EDAC conference slated to be held Aug. 24-26.</P>
      <P>Siew said that a major part of Taiwan's economic problems can be
traced to a confidence crisis. He added that the public tends to lose
confidence in future economic prospects when "political disturbances"
are added to the mix at a time of global economic sluggishness, while
the government lacks a clear set of economic policies to guide future
development directions.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that Taiwan is also facing the problem of
economic structural transformation and must find the best strategic
positions as the new economic structure is being established.</P>
      <P>Siew proposed that the government should create a "Taiwan
Innovation Research and Development Fund" to invest in strategic
industries with their innovative research or assist in the
establishment of new companies that aim to bring new and innovative
products to the market.</P>
      <P>He also proposed the establishment of an "Industry Structure
Reform Committee" to provide guidance for local companies trying to
reorganize or merge with one another.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he suggested that the number of local banks should be
greatly decreased within three years through mergers and that these
banks should write off bad loans within the same period in order to
drive the rate of overdue loans down to below 3 percent.</P>
      <P>Siew proposed that the government should immediately adjust its
"go slow, be patient" policy regulating Taiwan business investment in
mainland China and gradually allow direct trade, investment and
shipping between Taiwan and the mainland.</P>
      <P>He added that technology specialists from mainland China should
be allowed to come to Taiwan so that both capital and human resources
could undergo bilateral exchanges, which would be to the benefit of
the island.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN EXPATRIATES TO LAUNCH PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN FOR ROC'S U.N. BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Aug. 9 (CNA)
(By Eric Tseng and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Major Taiwanese associations on the U.S.
East Coast will launch a series of publicity programs to promote the
Republic of China's bid to join the United Nations, sources said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The groups, led by the Formosan Association of Public Affairs
(FAPA), are pushing overseas Chinese associations and prominent
Chinese community leaders across the United States to lobby American
Congress members to ask their government not to speak against the
ROC's U.N. bid this year.</P>
      <P>When the U.N. Steering Committee discussed whether to include the
ROC's U.N. bid into the General Assembly agenda last year, the United
States, Britain and France all voiced opposition to the proposal.</P>
      <P>A FAPA spokesman said he hopes this will not happen again this
year.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said major Taiwan expatriate groups, including the
FAPA, the Taiwanese Association and the U.S. East Coast chapter of
the ROC's ruling Democratic Progressive Party, will organize a parade
in areas adjacent to the U.N. headquarters Sept. 11 to express the
people of Taiwan's strong desire for a U.N. seat.</P>
      <P>"Through the parade, we hope to attract the attention of the U.N.
missions of countries around the world and the American public to our
U.N. bid," said the FAPA spokesman.</P>
      <P>The ROC, a U.N. founding member, has been shut out of the United
Nations and its affiliated organizations since 1971, when the General
Assembly gave the China seat to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Ten of the ROC's diplomatic allies presented a joint proposal to
the U.N. Secretariat Wednesday demanding that the U.N. General
Assembly set up a special working group to address the "exceptional
international situation" faced by Taiwan over the past three decades.</P>
      <P>This was the ninth time that ROC allies have filed such a
proposal to push the U.N. General Assembly to study measures for the
people of Taiwan's voice to be heard in the United Nations.</P>
      <P>In the past years, the ROC allies' proposal has consistently been
shot down at the U.N. Steering Committee due to mainland China's
opposition. The fate of this year's proposal "remains unclear," the
sources said, as the Steering Committee has yet to discuss the issue.
The General Assembly is scheduled to open its annual session in
mid-September.</P>
      <P>The 10 countries which jointly presented the proposal this year
are Belize, Burkina Faso, Chad, Dominica, El Salvador, The Gambia,
Nicaragua, Palau, Senegal and Tuvalu.</P>
      <P>In their joint proposal, the 10 ROC allies urged the U.N. General
Assembly to form a special working group to study Taiwan's U.N. bid
and invite ROC representatives to take part in the working panel to
facilitate its work.</P>
      <P>The proposal also urged the U.N. General Assembly and the
international community to express more concern about the development
of cross-Taiwan Strait relations and to encourage both sides to
resume dialogue.</P>
      <P>The ROC representative office in New York invited the U.N.
ambassadors of Greneda, The Gambia, Nicaragua and Tuvalu to attend a
news conference Thursday to explain why their countries would support
the ROC's U.N. bid.</P>
      <P>All four ambassadors said friendship was only one of the reasons
behind their countries' support for the ROC's drive to seek a U.N.
seat.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC's U.N. bid is a fight for "concept and
belief," the four ambassadors said they have thrown their support
behind the ROC's cause mainly out of their belief in justice and
fairness. They said it is extremely unreasonable and unfair to
exclude the ROC from the United Nations and its affiliates.</P>
      <P>The ambassadors said the ROC is fully qualified for a U.N. seat
in view of its economic strength, political democratization and
willingness and capability to help other countries in their national
development.</P>

Manufacturing Corp. (TSMC) Chairman Morris Chang said Friday.</P>
      <P>In both the short term and the long term, the prospects for the
local IC industry are optimistic, Chang said, predicting that the
local industry will regain momentum in the next quarter and will
strongly rebound in the middle of next year. Based on the principles
of Moore's Law, he pointed out, the long-haul prospects for the
industry are optimistic.</P>
      <P>The TSMC chief made the remarks while attending a seminar on high
technology in Taiwan, mainland China and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's semiconductor foundries are the most advanced
in the world, Chang claimed, "legal protection and quick innovation"
are the most important "economic values" for hi-tech businesses.
Taiwan hi-tech businesses should seek to upgrade the "economic value"
of their products, or they will be caught up by their mainland
Chinese counterparts in five or 10 years, he warned.</P>
      <P>Chang also pointed out that Taiwan is facing the problem of a
lack of "creative talent." He said it is important that a creative
culture and inventive climate is built in Taiwan and that Taiwan must
connect its economic strength and technology clout with those of
mainland China and Hong Kong to explore the most value-added
technologies and products.</P>
      <P>In response to a proposal that the Taiwan authorities should
allow the local IC industry to develop in mainland China, Chang said
"the viewpoint may be correct" because by doing so, it would be
easier to recruit well-trained professional elite in the mainland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET WILL NOT HOLD NON-BINDING REFERENDUM ON NUCLEAR POWER PLANT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet announced Friday that it has
decided not to hold a non-binding referendum on the controversial
fourth nuclear power plant alongside the year-end elections for
legislators and local government chiefs.</P>
      <P>Cabinet Secretary-General Chiou I-jen said at a news conference
that Premier Chang Chun-hsiung made the decision after "prudently
evaluating" the conclusions reached by a special Cabinet task force.</P>
      <P>"The special panel made a thorough study of the issue from eight
angles -- the scope, funding, manpower, legality, possible impact on
the local economy, elements of uncertainty, possible reaction of
anti-nuclear groups and environmental activists, and government
credibility," Chiou said.</P>
      <P>As the possible effects of "elements of uncertainty" are
difficult to control and evaluate, Chiou said Chang finally decided
to scrap a previous plan to hold a referendum on the fourth nuclear
power plant project. As Taiwan has yet to legislate a plebiscite law,
if the proposed referendum were to be held, its results would in any
case be non-binding.</P>
      <P>Chiou said the premier felt sorry for his failure to honor the
promise to cancel the referendum plan.</P>
      <P>Chiou stressed that the cancellation does not imply that the
Cabinet opposes the people's right to a referendum under the
Constitution.</P>
      <P>Chiou said that whether a referendum on the controversial plant
will be held in the future will depend on the domestic political
situation.</P>
      <P>The current government, led by the anti-nuclear Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), abruptly announced its decision to halt
construction on the partially built nuclear power plant last October.</P>
      <P>The announcement immediately drew strong opposition from the
three major opposition parties -- the Kuomintang (KMT), the People
First Party (PFP) and the New Party (NP).</P>
      <P>The three opposition parties, which jointly control nearly
two-thirds of the seats in the legislature, then formed an alliance
to boycott the DPP minority government's policy proposals at every
turn. Bowing to pressure from the opposition alliance, the DPP
government finally resumed construction of the controversial power
plant early this year after a 101-day hiatus.</P>
      <P>At that time, Chang promised to hold a non-binding referendum on
the project along with the year-end legislative elections in an
effort to defuse a backlash from anti-nuclear diehards, including
former DPP Chairman Yin Yi-hsiung.</P>
      <P>The proposal drew mixed reactions in local society. Chang then
formed a panel to study the feasibility of the referendum plan. As
the Taiwan economy has been mired in a downturn since the beginning
of this year, many people have voiced opposition to the referendum
plan as they fear that renewed debate on the issue would again cause
political instability and hinder economic recovery.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINESE HIJACKERS EXECUTED FOR MURDER IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After being on death row for almost 10
years, two mainland Chinese hijackers were executed Friday night at
the Taipei Prison for kidnap and murder.</P>
      <P>Minister of Justice Chen Ding-nan signed the execution orders for
Cho Chang-jen and Chiang Hung-chuan Friday, clearing up the last
formalities for their execution.</P>
      <P>Cho and Chiang were charged with kidnapping and murdering a local
businessman in 1991.</P>
      <P>Although their cases had been tried six times by courts at
various levels, the death sentences handed down by the court of the
first trial remained unchanged and were finalized last Sept. 22, when
the Supreme Court threw out their appeal.</P>
      <P>They were given a reprieve last October when the country's
supreme watchdog the Control Yuan stepped in at the request of Cho's
wife to review the case and put the executions on hold.</P>
      <P>After an eight-month examination, the Control Yuan decided
recently not to interfere, saying it found no evidence to justify a
reopening of the trial.</P>
      <P>The case has drawn the limelight from the very beginning because
the two inmates were once hailed as anti-communist heroes in Taiwan.
Cho and Chiang, along with four others, fled to Taiwan from mainland
China by hijacking a mainland Chinese airplane to South Korea in
1983.</P>
      <P>They were escorted to Taiwan in 1984 after being tried and jailed
briefly in South Korea as hijackers.</P>
      <P>The disputes over the six hijackers strained Taipei-Seoul ties
when the two countries were close Cold War allies.</P>
      <P>Cho married one of the female hijackers after settling in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>One of Cho's accomplice in the kidnap-murder case, Shih
Hsiao-nin, who is one of the six hijackers in the 1983 case, was
sentenced to life imprisonment.</P>
      <P>Cho and Chiang were the first "anti-communist heroes" to be
executed for crimes in Taiwan. They each agreed to donate their
organs after being executed, which means they were each shot with a
pistol at close range in the neck rather than in the heart, to
protect their organs from damage.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT'S REMARKS ON `ONE CHINA' TOUCH OFF MIXED REACTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   10   (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian's remarks that the "one China" issue should be resolved
through the tone of the ROC Constitution drew mixed responses from
various parties Friday.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, an official of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT),
said that the KMT has always handled the "one China" in accordance
with the Constitution.</P>
      <P>He said that 14 national policy advisors to Chen proposed last
month that the government act to resolve the "one China" issue in
line with the Constitution, but the proposal was immediately opposed
by over 30 senior advisors and national policy advisors to the
president.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Chang said, he doubted Chen's ability to live up to
the remarks he made Friday and that he also doubted his ability to
quell the divided opinions within the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Chen told visiting U.S. Senator Christopher Bond that "only in
line with the spirit of the ROC Constitution can the cross-strait
differences be resolved" and added that adhering to the Constitution
"is also the best answer to the method for resolving the `one China'
issue for the governments and people of the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait."</P>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (DPP) spokesman Chang Hsien-yao
described Chen's statement as a very important step forward from his
previous position on the issue.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that the DPP will extend help to the
president on the issue rather than becoming a "blocking stone" on the
road to the normalization of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative caucus leader Chou Hsi-wei said that Chen is
"always inconsistent" in his remarks made to foreign visitors and to
the people at home.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he urged the president to clearly spell out whether he
recognizes the "one China" as stated in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, DPP legislative caucus leader Tsai Huang-lang
pointed out that "one China" in the Constitution means the Republic
of China.</P>
      <P>He said that mainland China "must respect the ROC as a country
with independent sovereignty and respect Chen as the 10th president
elected in accordance with the Constitution."</P>
      <P>Tsai said that substantive negotiations on "one China" can
proceed only after the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are able to
conduct talks on a peaceful and equitable basis.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Chen
Ming-tung reiterated the MAC's position, saying that both sides
should sit down again to find an acceptable solution to "one China."</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan will never accept Beijing's "one China" stance,
which regards the PRC as the "one China."</P>
      <P>"It is impossible for the ROC government, the president or other
officials to accept this," Chen stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC VICE PRESIDENT CALLS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  11  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Saturday
that now is the time to carry out a complete re-assessment of water
and land conservation in Taiwan in order to find the best ways to
protect the environment.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar organized by the presidential Technology
Advisory Committee on the possible factors that led to the widespread
devastation caused by the passing of last Monday's Typhoon Toraji and
how post-disaster reconstruction should proceed, Lu said that seeing
the verdant countryside destroyed made her feel as if "God has become
angry" and as if the land is fighting back against mankind.</P>
      <P>Lu, who serves as chairwoman of the advisory committee, pointed
out that some believe the disastrous losses brought about by Toraji
could be attributed to the global climate changes that have led to an
increase in the number of typhoons in the region, while others say
that artificial factors, including excessive development, are the
major culprits.</P>
      <P>Stressing that although she is not expressing her dissatisfaction
at the nation's betel nut farmers, Lu said that the fashionable
"betel nut culture" -- as evidenced by the 3 million people in Taiwan
who chew them, consuming 15 million betel nuts a year, or the
equivalent worth of NT$100 billion (US$2.89 billion) -- must be
"re-evaluated."</P>
      <P>Typhoon Toraji, which killed 103 people and left 110 still
missing in Central Taiwan, caused massive mudslides that some have
attributed to the over-planting of shallow-rooted betel nut trees in
slopeland areas.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, at a seminar organized by the National Policy
Foundation on the effects of the most recently agreed upon
international measures to control global warming on Taiwan, former
Vice Premier Liu Chao-shiuan warned that Taiwan's average surface
temperature has already gone up by 1.3 degrees Celsius since 1940 --
a figure even greater than the global average increase of 0.6 degrees
Celsius since the beginning of the 20th century.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the addition of other factors such as
excessive development of slopeland areas and excessive drawing of
underground water will lead to more natural disasters.</P>
      <P>Lee Chien-ming, deputy director of the Taiwan Research
Institute's Department of Enterprise Economics, said at the same
seminar that the government should begin planning pragmatic measures
in response to the possibility that Taiwan will soon face
international regulations on lowering greenhouse gas emissions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>36 FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS UNDER SUPERVISION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  11  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Bureau of Monetary Affairs under the
Finance Ministry and the Central Deposits Insurance Corp. took the
initiative Friday to put 36 faltering local financial institutions
under supervision.</P>
      <P>The move is the first phase of a "Monetary Reconstruction Fund"
action to consolidate the operations of local banks and farmers as
well as fishermen's cooperatives.</P>
      <P>The Monetary Reconstruction Fund under the Executive Yuan has
formed a task force composed of personnel specialized in legal
affairs, information technology and credit business, who have been
temporarily transferred from the Bank of Taiwan, the Land Bank of
Taiwan, the Taiwan Cooperative Bank and the Farmer's Bank of China.</P>
      <P>The task force personnel have been assigned to the 36
institutions to check on their cash deposit status as well as their
credit accounts. The institutions with negative net assets include 27
credit departments of farmer's associations, two credit departments
of fishermen's associations and seven credit cooperatives, mostly in
rural or coastal areas of central and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The task force will supervise the operations of these badly
performing banks over the next three months and help them find merger
possibilities.</P>
      <P>Vice Finance Minister Chen Chun, who is concurrently vice
chairman of the Monetary Reconstruction Fund management committee,
said that the services of these 36 institutions will not be affected
by the task force's supervision. He added that the Finance Ministry
and the Central Bank of China would give a joint explanation of the
operations to the press Sunday.</P>
      <P>He said that the rights and benefits of all deposit accounts of
the 36 institutions are guaranteed. He also noted that the
accumulated amount of the deposit accounts total some NT$200 billion,
representing less than 1 percent of the overall amount of all banking
deposits in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Immediately after the stationing of the task force personnel, 14
farmer's and fishermen's cooperatives agreed to hand over the
management of their credit departments. These departments are likely
to be merged with public banks in the future.</P>
      <P>The Monetary Reconstruction Fund was set up in July to help solve
the financial problems of Taiwan's financial institutions. The task
force will evaluate the status of the problem institutions and the
fund can entrust the Central Deposit Insurance Corp. to manage the
debts and assets of these institutions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. ANALYST: 2008 OLYMPICS SHOULD BE LINKED TO ASIA-PACIFIC PEACE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  10  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An American China expert said Friday
that linking the 2008 Olympic Games directly to peace in the
Asia-Pacific region would provide effective leverage over mainland
China's behavior for the next seven years.</P>
      <P>John Tkacik, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a U.S.
think tank, said it also would demonstrate that the United States is
committed to "furthering human rights and democratic principles" and
that affronts to those values will not be ignored.</P>
      <P>Tkacik wrote in an analysis that many Americans remain concerned
that mainland China's penchant for repression of dissent at home and
aggressive behavior toward its neighbors could compromise the
Olympics.</P>
      <P>The Beijing Games will not begin for another seven years, time
enough for the United States and other freedom-loving countries to
compel Beijing to adopt true Olympic values and to demonstrate good
behavior beyond its borders and at home by treating all people
fairly, said Tkacik.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, Washington should make clear to Beijing
that the international community expects it to welcome rather than
repress the profound contributions that religious beliefs, practices
and charitable works make to society; encourage political reform;
commit to the rule of law based on international norms; and eschew
military bluster against Taiwan while accepting Taiwan's offers to
discuss their differences as equals.</P>
      <P>To this end, Tkacik said, America's leaders should caution
Beijing that its use of force against Taiwan could spark an
international boycott of the 2008 Games, should insist that visitors
to mainland China be free of official threats to their person and
property because of their political, social or religious views and
keep the focus on mainland China's behavior.</P>
      <P>Congress, for example, could require the State Department to make
quarterly updates of its human rights records on mainland China, as
well as regular reports on Beijing's aggressive behavior toward its
neighbors and nations littoral to the South China Sea. "Such reports
would indicate whether more concrete sanctions were needed,"
according to Tkacik.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MINISTER ADVOCATES DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT TRADE AFTER WTO ENTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  11  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi
has voiced explicit support for opening direct trade links between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait after both sides are admitted to
the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Lin expressed his advocacy in a written report delivered Saturday
at a preparatory meeting of the cross-strait affairs panel under the
soon-to-be-convened Economic Development Advisory Conference (EDAC).</P>
      <P>It was the first time that Lin had made a concrete suggestion on
the opening of direct cross-strait trade. Under current Republic of
China law, cross-strait trade must be conducted via a third country
or area.</P>
      <P>In his report, Lin also suggested that the two sides should start
negotiations as early as possible for opening direct sea and air
cargo transportation links.</P>
      <P>Lin said that direct cross-strait shipping and air links would
help cut transport time and cost as well as reduce cargo inventory.
"And direct cargo transport links would also bring about positive
effects on cross-strait trade and Taiwan's bid to become a global
business planning and resourcing hub," he noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said, Taiwan should allow more mainland Chinese
products to enter its market to facilitate local enterprises' global
business planning.</P>
      <P>At present, only 56.4 of the items produced in the mainland are
allowed to enter Taiwan. "As the times and industrial structure have
been changing rapidly, we must review existing restrictions and make
necessary adjustments," the minister said.</P>
      <P>With a view to averting any possible adverse impact of opening
direct cross-strait trade and expanding the list of mainland products
to be allowed into the local market, Lin said Taiwan must
simultaneously establish comprehensive import relief and self-defense
systems in compliance with relevant WTO requirements.</P>
      <P>Current WTO regulations allow member economies to establish
self-defense systems to prevent dumping of farm produce, textiles and
other categories of products. To prevent non-market economies from
exporting goods at prices under fair market value, the WTO also
permits its members to adopt defensive anti-dumping measures to cope
with unfair trade practices of those countries.</P>
      <P>With its cheap labor, low land cost and vast market, Lin said,
mainland China has become one of the world's most important
production centers for computers and consumer electronics.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he went on, mainland China has used its large potential
market in exchange for technology transfers and access to setting
product standards. As a result, Lin said, mainland China's influence
on Taiwan's economic and industrial development has increased
steadily. "Against this backdrop, we must adjust our cross-strait
trade policy from time to time to cope with the new challenges," he
added.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lin remained cautious toward appeals by local
entrepreneurs -- particularly those in the petrochemical and silicon
wafer industries -- to ease restrictions on mainland China-bound
investments.</P>
      <P>Lin reaffirmed the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) stance on
establishing a dynamic, flexible mechanism for adjusting the existing
"go slow, be patient" policy on cross-strait investment.</P>
      <P>He admitted that the current restrictions on the scale of
cross-strait investment and the businesses allowed to invest have
become outdated and may hinder Taiwan companies' development in the
increasingly competitive global market.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan companies' investment projects have become
ever larger, Lin said the current US$50 million ceiling for a single
mainland China-bound investment plan may blunt Taiwan enterprises'
competitive edge.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, the MOEA suggests that mainland China-bound
investment projects worth more than US$50 million be screened and
approved on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the general
situations of different industries.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lin said the cap for accumulated mainland investment
amount of each company should also be adjusted in line with the
principle of "dynamic adjustment" to facilitate management of
mainland China-bound investment.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, he urged Taiwan enterprises to join forces with
the government to develop the island into a research and development
center and a hub for high value-added industries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KUOMINTANG URGES ROC PRESIDENT TO CLARIFY `ONE CHINA' REMARK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  11  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) urged
Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian Saturday to clarify his
remarks that the "one China" issue should be resolved through the ROC
Constitution, claiming that regional stability is at stake.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, a KMT official in charge of mainland Chinese
affairs, said that if Chen were to allow the mixed responses to his
remarks and the different interpretations to spin out of control,
then the public's faith in his leadership would only continue to
falter -- which would be "very disadvantageous" to Taiwan at a
"perilous time" for the situation in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen told visiting U.S. Senator Christopher Bond Friday that
"only in line with the spirit of the ROC Constitution can
cross-strait differences be resolved" and added that adhering to the
Constitution "is also the best answer to the method for resolving the
`one China' issue for the governments and people of the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait."</P>
      <P>Chang said that if Chen truly has the sincerity to interpret "one
China" according to the Constitution, then that stance would be in
line with the beliefs of the opposition KMT, People First Party and
New Party.</P>
      <P>That position would also be congruent with a recent
recommendation on the issue by 14 of Chen's national policy advisers
and with the final suggestion of a supra-partisan team that was
instructed by the president last year to study the issue, Chang
added.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that voices against "one China, according to
the Constitution" come mainly from within the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) itself and he urged Chen to clarify his
remarks in order to resolve the internal differences between the
government and the DPP.</P>
      <P>Left unchecked, Chang continued, the different interpretations
will only reinforce the "international image" that the Chen
administration wavers on its mainland China policies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN REMAINS WORLD'S NO. 1 NOTEBOOK SUPPLIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  11  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Estimated to gross 52.1 percent of the
world notebook market share, Taiwan will remain the top supplier of
notebooks this year, though the market share is declining, according
to the Institute of Information Industry (III).</P>
      <P>A recently released analysis of the Market Intelligence Center
(MIC) of the III shows that in the first half of this year, Taiwan's
notebook manufacturers put out 6,196,000 notebook computers with a
production value amounting to US$5.816 billion.</P>
      <P>Facing growing competition from South Korea and shrinking orders
from Japan, both the production volume and value were less than those
of the same period of last year, down 4 percent and 16.9 percent,
respectively, according to the analysis.</P>
      <P>Taking into account the international economic environment, local
notebook manufacturers are not optimistic about the prospects for the
third quarter and uncertain about the fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>The MIC forecasts that Taiwan's notebook output will reach
13,094,000 units this year, about 52.1 percent of the overall world
demand of 25,116,000 units. Last year, Taiwan's notebook output
totaled 12,707,000 units, supplying 52.5 percent of the world demand.</P>
      <P>According to the analysis, Taiwan's notebook manufacturers have
been successful in the international market by supplying quality
products at comparatively lower prices. However, they must not rely
on the existing advantages, especially when their South Korean
counterparts are putting much effort into research and development.</P>
      <P>In recent months, Japanese manufacturers have supplied fewer and
fewer OEM orders to Taiwan's notebook factories, because depreciation
of the yen has led Japanese manufacturers to increase their
self-sufficiency and to reduce supplies from abroad.</P>
      <P>The analysis suggests that local manufacturers develop products
of higher added-value and acquire patent rights for their designs in
order to improve their international competitiveness.</P>

Shui-bian should be granted a visa to allow him to receive in person
the Liberal International 2001 "Prize for Freedom" in Copenhagen in
November.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Politikken daily in response to Danish
Foreign Minister Mogens Lykketoft's decision not to grant Chen a visa
in accordance with what Lykketoft described as an agreement among
E.U. nations not to issue visas for top officials from Taiwan,
Nielsen said that the 1988 agreement is not politically binding.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the ROC is a free and democratic country
that should be given the space and the opportunity to participate in
international social activities.</P>
      <P>Saying that Denmark has "no reason" to refuse Chen a visa,
Nielsen said that Liberal International, a London-based federation of
liberal parties from around the world, is not a government

      <P>According to a Danish news agency, the 1988 agreement between 15
E.U. nations called only for a stop to official exchanges with senior

    <HEADLINE>CAA MAY FACE LONG-TERM SUIT OVER SQ006 DISASTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)
may be trapped in a long-term suit over the crash of a Singapore
Airlines (SIA) plane at Chiang Kai-shek (CKS) International Airport
in northern Taiwan last October, aviation officials said Saturday.</P>
      <P>CAA sources said family members of some of those who were killed
in the crash of SIA Flight SQ006 Oct. 31, 2000 have jointly filed a
lawsuit against the airline in the United States because they were
dissatisfied with the SIA compensation terms.</P>
      <P>As the Singapore carrier claims that CKS airport had some
management flaws in the case, it has asked the family members to list
the CAA as a co-defendant to share the responsibility for the
tragedy.</P>
      <P>The bereaved family members were able to file the suit in the
United States because the ill-fated Boeing 747 was bound for Los
Angeles from Singapore via Taipei.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether the U.S. court will
agree to handle the lawsuit.</P>
      <P>CAA officials said they do not think that the CAA should be held
responsible for the crash that killed 83 of the 179 passengers and
crew aboard.</P>
      <P>But the final investigative report on the causes of the air
disaster has yet to be released. If the final report concludes that
airport facilities or measures -- including control tower
instructions -- should be reviewed, the CAA's image and reputation
will be tarnished.</P>
      <P>CAA officials said SIA has retained many prominent lawyers to
defend its stance. As international lawsuits over air crashes usually
turn out to be long-term legal battles, the officials said, the CAA
plans to set aside a budget to finance relevant legal expenses.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China's Aviation Safety Council came up with a
factual report on the SQ006 crash early this year, while a final
report on the disaster's main causes and other relevant factors is
scheduled to be released late this year or early in 2002.</P>
      <P>The jumbo jet mistakenly entered the closed No. 5 runway while it
was waiting to take off from CKS airport in stormy weather. The plane
burst into flames after hitting construction equipment on the runway,
which had been closed for repair.</P>
      <P>The Aviation Safety Council immediately launched an investigation
into the possible causes of the tragedy. Civil aviation experts from
the United States and Singapore also joined the probe.</P>
      <P>The most inexplicable point in the case is why the SIA pilots
would have entered the wrong runway. Although the Singapore carrier
issued a public apology for the error of the plane's three pilots, it
also questioned the airport's failure to adopt enough precautionary
measures to prevent aircraft from entering the closed runway.</P>
      <P>The pilots -- flight commander Capt. Foong Chee Kong, 41, a
Malaysian, and Singaporean co-pilots Latif Cyrano, 36, and Ng Keng
Leng, 38 -- were allowed to return to Singapore last December after
Singaporean authorities guaranteed that they will come to Taipei when
they are needed for the crash investigation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLICE, IT EXPERTS DIVIDED ON SETTING UP FINGERPRINT DATABANK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  11  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Local society remained divided Saturday
over whether a national fingerprint databank should be established to
facilitate criminal investigations and prevention of identification
(ID) card forgery.</P>
      <P>While police authorities have advocated the "necessity" of
setting up a nationwide fingerprint databank, some information
technology experts think otherwise and have expressed doubts about
the so-called crime-prevention function of such a databank.</P>
      <P>Lin Kuo-tung, deputy director of the Criminal Investigation
Bureau under the National Police Administration, said at a seminar
organized by Taipei City Councilor Chou Po-ya Saturday that
establishing a national fingerprint databank should have been
launched in 1997.</P>
      <P>"However, the project has long been delayed out of considerations
of human rights and dignity, as well as the possibility of the
integration of ID cards and National Health Insurance cards," Lin
said.</P>
      <P>He claimed that although requiring Republic of China citizens to
have their fingerprints taken "might hurt their personal dignity or
basic human rights," the measure has many merits, including
facilitating identity checks and criminal investigations, as well as
protecting ordinary people from falling victim to ID card forgery.</P>
      <P>Lin said "several countries" have implemented the measure
requiring all of their people to have their fingerprints taken.</P>
      <P>Yu Ying-fu, a Fu Jen Catholic University professor, claimed that
"more than 80 percent" of the residents of Taipei City's Ta-an
district have come to accept the measure since the district's
household registration office began to set up a databank of
fingerprints of district residents.</P>
      <P>"Many Ta-an residents have recognized the convenience offered by
the fingerprint databank when they come to the district office
without their ID cards," Yu said.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Chuang Ting-jui, an associate
research fellow with Academia Sinica's Institute of Information
Science, pointed out, however, that fingerprints have nothing to do
with household registration affairs.</P>
      <P>Chuang said that requiring a person to have his or her
fingerprints taken violates not only the household registration law

    <HEADLINE>FAMILY MEMBERS PROTEST OVER CAMPUS DEATH OF STUDENT IN AUSTRALIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Family members of a Taiwan student who was
killed on the campus of an Australian university last year staged a
protest Saturday at a Taipei hotel where several Australian
universities were holding a joint exhibit to attract local students.</P>
      <P>The relatives of Lin Chun, 26, who was killed on the campus of
the University of New South Wales (UNSW) by a runaway lorry April 19
last year, said their protest was mainly aimed at pushing Australian
authorities to promise to improve campus safety.</P>
      <P>Lin's husband, Wu Cheng-chung, said his wife was just walking
across a pedestrian precinct to collect her transcript when she was
"senselessly" crushed to death against a brick wall by an unmanned,
out of control truck.</P>
      <P>"Why did the driver park his truck in a `No Parking' area?" Wu
asked.</P>
      <P>He said he was particularly saddened by UNSW's reluctance to give
an explanation of what he said was its "lax" campus safety measures.
"I was also disappointed by Australian law enforcement authorities'
failure to publish their investigative report," he said, adding: "The
coroner's report is `seriously overdue.'" According to Wu, this made
it impossible for him to believe the report.</P>
      <P>Wu also criticized the Australian government for "failing to
respect life."</P>
      <P>Wu said he hopes that his "peaceful and rational" demonstration
will pressure the Australian government to promise to pay heed to the
safety of expatriate Taiwan students.</P>
      <P>Wu also threatened to launch a campaign urging young Taiwan
students not to travel to Australia to study if the Australian
government refuses to improve the situation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. UNHAPPY WITH HANDLING OF PROPOSED VISIT BY ROC PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   Aug.   10  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The suggestion of a visit to
Washington, D.C. this year by President Chen Shui-bian of the
Republic of China has apparently raised some eyebrows within the Bush
administration, with one official taking exception to the lack of
consultation between the two governments.</P>
      <P>"The administration was disappointed at learning of the news only
through media inquiries," the unnamed official said Friday.</P>
      <P>"The way this was handled raises questions and concerns about how
well Washington and Taipei understand each other's intentions and
objectives," he added.</P>
      <P>The official made the comments on a recent exchange of letters
between Chen's office and Richard A. Ryan, president of the
prestigious National Press Club (NPC) in Washington.</P>
      <P>In a letter dated July 25, Chen said that he "would be most happy
and honored to accept "a written invitation from Ryan to appear as a
luncheon speaker at the NPC."</P>
      <P>He said that he would instruct his representative to make
arrangements with Ryan's staff for the speech, to be delivered in
September or October, as the NPC president suggested, or at a date
that is mutually convenient.</P>
      <P>If realized, such a visit would mark a historic breakthrough in
the unofficial ties between the United States and Taiwan. No ROC head
of state has ever visited the U.S. capital.</P>
      <P>A visit around the time of President George W. Bush's own trip to
mainland China would be particularly sensitive given Beijing's likely
reaction. Bush is scheduled to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit in Shanghai Oct. 20 and then travel to Beijing for
meetings with senior Chinese leaders.</P>
      <P>Asked by reporters, both the White House and the State Department
said that the administration has received no request for a visit by
Chen to Washington. Now there are doubts as to whether there will be
such a request any time soon.</P>
      <P>In a rare interview, the official told the CNA that the Bush
administration officials have made "serious efforts ... to improve
the quality of our relations and to treat Taiwan's leaders with
dignity and respect."</P>
      <P>"Under these circumstances, one would hope for improved
consultations (between Taipei and Washington)," he said. "This
episode was not a good example of the kind of consultations we try to
achieve."</P>
      <P>When asked to comment, C.J. Chen, Taiwan's chief representative
to Washington, would only say that Chen's response to the invitation
indicated his intention to "reciprocate goodwill."</P>
      <P>He refused to disclose the contents of any discussions with U.S.
officials. However, another Taiwan diplomat admitted that there were
"some ruffled feathers" in the administration, but stressed that the
episode is "over."</P>
      <P>Neither side would give any details but informed sources have
said that Taiwan officials have had better access to U.S. officials
now than during the previous Clinton administration.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC VICE PRESIDENT SPEAKS OF DEVELOPMENT OF CROSS-STRAIT TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 11 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Annette Lu
said Friday that she is not opposed to direct transport links between
Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>As it is very inconvenient to travel to the mainland by way of
Hong Kong and Macao, she said that Penghu could be designated as a
transshipment airport as it is located at the mid-point of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Lu said that Beijing has been exerting "soft and hard tactics"
toward Taiwan -- inviting Taiwan businessmen to investment in the
mainland China on the one hand while increasing its military threat
to Taiwan on the other.</P>
      <P>The vice president urged the people of Taiwan and the
international community to ask Beijing to remove hundreds of missiles
targeting Taiwan along its southern coast.</P>
      <P>She said that the present cross-strait situation remains tense
and noted that Taiwan should strengthen its defense capability and
engage in preventive diplomatic work against the threat from the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Lu said that she had launched a campaign to encourage the people
of Taiwan to write letters to Beijing's leaders, telling them that
they want peace, not war.</P>
      <P>She expressed hope that all travelers from Taiwan will urge
Beijing to remove the missiles whenever they meet with
relatives and friends in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Turning to the projected rally for world peace to be held in
Taipei next week, Lu said that she formed the Taiwan Alliance for
World Peace July 13 to promote peace-related activities.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, several international non-governmental
organizations have thrown their support behind the activities and
added that foreign participants will include "leaders from 11
international organizations, 14 parliamentarians from six countries
and six Nobel Peace Prize winners."</P>
      <P>At the upcoming Peace Forum, Lu said, the participants will hear
reports on the present situation of cross-strait relations and will
also visit the ROC-controlled island of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>She said that the forum will discuss how to create "genuine
everlasting peace" across the Taiwan Strait and will also discuss
whether Beijing's "one China" policy is a model or a hindrance to
peace.</P>
      <P>Lu expressed the hope that the foreign participants will get an
impression that "Taiwan is a peacemaker," not a "troublemaker."</P>
      <P>She added that because of her busy work schedule in preparing for
her world peace rally, she will be unable to attend an international
symposium scheduled to be held in Switzerland Aug. 17.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW PARTY CALLS FOR POLL TO DETERMINE CANDIDATE FOR OPPOSITION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 12 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition New Party called Sunday for
the three opposition parties to choose, through polls, a common
candidate to run for magistrate of Taipei County in the year-end
elections.</P>
      <P>Ho Chen-sheng, deputy secretary-general of the New Party, said
Wang Chien-shien, the New Party's candidate for the Taipei County
magistrateship, would meet Chin Chin-sheng, the candidate named by
the opposition People First Party, for the same post Monday, to
explore a way to nominate a joint candidate in the race.</P>
      <P>Ho said Wang would suggest that Chin accept a poll as a way to
choose a candidate acceptable to both parties and also the opposition
Kuomintang, which has also nominated its own candidate in the race.</P>
      <P>Given that the year-end election is only three months away, Ho
said, however, that Chin's demand to have the polls staged two months
after would-be nominators of three parties had already started
canvassing votes for the straw poll is unrealistic.</P>
      <P>It would be a waste of time and resources, since two would-be
candidates would be excluded from the race after they had already
devoted energy to the straw polls, said Ho.</P>
      <P>He also called on the PFP back down on its demand that candidates
should be given different preference in the straw polls according to
the number of their party followers.</P>
      <P>Ho said victory in the year-end election lies more in the merits
of the individual candidates than in the candidate's political
affiliation, and therefore the candidate from the bigger party would
not necessarily have a better chance of winning the race than their
smaller party rivals.</P>
      <P>The three opposition parties fielded their own candidates after a
fruitless attempt to search for a candidate who could command the
support of all, even though they know that individually, their
candidates will have a hard job competing against incumbent
magistrate Su Tseng-chang of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT TRADE TO BENEFIT MANY INDUSTRIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 12 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Many investment consulting companies voiced
agreement Sunday with Economics Minister Lin Hsin-yi's proposal to
open direct trade links between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
after both sides are admitted to the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Lin expressed his support for the idea in a written report
presented Saturday at a preparatory meeting of the cross-strait
affairs panel under the soon-to-be-convened Economic Development
Advisory Conference (EDAC), initiated by President Chen Shui-bian to
spur the local economy.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that Lin had made a concrete suggestion on
the opening of direct cross-strait trade and allowing more mainland
Chinese products to enter the Taiwan market. Under current Republic
of China law, cross-strait trade must be conducted via a third
country or area.</P>
      <P>Tin Yu-chia, president of International Investment Trust Co.
Ltd., said that the opening of cross-strait trade will have great
negative impact on Taiwan's agricultural sector as a result of an
influx of cheap farm products from the mainland and claimed that some
200,000 farmers will lose their jobs.</P>
      <P>Some industries, such as the automobile, tire, electric
appliance, heavy electrical machinery, and paper making industries
are expected to lose their competitive edge after the opening of
cross-strait trade, while the local textile industry will also
experience pressure from competitors as a result of the scrapping of
import quotas, Tin said.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, other sectors, such as banking, stocks and
securities, insurance, oil products, retail marketing,
telecommunications, and electronic components are expected to go to
mainland China in search of the huge market share there after the
opening of these markets.</P>
      <P>Some investment consulting companies predicted that after the
opening of direct cross-strait trade links, direct transport links
will follow, which are expected to reduce significantly the transport
costs for local industries and also represent a stimulus to Taiwan's
stock market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIR, SHIPPING INDUSTRIES WAITING FOR DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT TRADE LINKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  12  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The domestic shipping and air industries
had prepared for the start of a direct cross-Taiwan Strait trade
link long before Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi voiced
explicit support of such links Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lin voiced his support in a preparatory meeting on cross-strait
affairs under the soon-to-be-convened Economic Development Advisory
Conference (EDAC), saying that direct cross-strait shipping and air
links would help cut transport time and costs.</P>
      <P>However, most shipping operators, eyeing the trade potential
after direct cross-strait links, began jockeying for position a long
time ago.</P>
      <P>Industry representatives noted that the market potential of
mainland China has attracted worldwide attention following its
economic reform policy. Statistics show that annual trade in the
mainland has grown by an average of more than 10 percent annually
over recent years, with the percentage of trade between Taiwan and
mainland China even higher.</P>
      <P>The scale of mainland China's container market accommodation is
even more stunning. As of the end of 2,000, it had reached 10 million
TEUs (twenty-feet equivalent units).</P>
      <P>Tempted by such rosy prospects, Taiwan shipping companies such as
Evergreen Marine Corp. and Yangming Marine Transport Corp. set up set
up representative offices six or seven years ago in the mainland.</P>
      <P>But as the two sides of the Taiwan Straits have yet to open
direct trade links, operators have been unable to set up branches
there, and their profits have suffered because they have been unable
to handle some of the business. In addition their ships have to go
through third places for indirect shipping, which adds to operational
costs.</P>
      <P>Industry representatives believe that shipping costs will be
dramatically cut after the two sides establish direct trade links,
citing the example of a container of 400 TEUs. If the container is
taken directly from Taiwan to Shanghai without passing through
Ishigaki island -- as required under the present situation -- the
shipping time will be cut by one day and the distance traveled cut by
164.5 nautical miles.</P>
      <P>In contrast, if the container vessel sails at 14 knots and docks
in a third country, the transport cost will increase by US$2,400,
harbor costs will increase by US$1,640, wages for the crew will rise
by US$857 and insurance will increase by US$118.5.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, direct cross-strait trade links will also be a boon
for the air industry.</P>
      <P>Chuei Yung, chairman of Far Eastern Air Transport Corp., said
that after direct cross-strait links are established, it is estimated
that it will bring trade potential of between NT$30 billion and NT$60
billion, in contrast with the present NT$20 billion.</P>
      <P>Far Eastern Air Transport has been trying to establish a foothold
in the mainland for a long time. In addition to setting up a
representative office in Beijing, its repair and maintenance
department was certified by the Civil Aviation Administration of
China last September, becoming the second airliner in Taiwan after
China Airlines to have obtain such certification.</P>
      <P>Although direct air links will have no benefits for CAL and Far
Eastern Airlines, which basically focus on international flights,
operators estimate that if one can have first freedom -- meaning
permission to fly over territorial airspace -- it will cut flying
time from Taiwan to European destinations by two or three hours and
fuel costs will also be dramatically cut.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, if other freedoms are obtained and Taiwan
aircraft can fly directly to various airports in the mainland, then
not only operation costs, but also fuel costs, will be cut
dramatically.</P>
      <P>The operators estimate that fuel costs from Taipei to Fuzhou will
be cut the most -- by 75 percent -- with Taipei-Xiamen costs cut by
62.5 percent. Taipei-Shanghai and Taipei-Beijing will also be cut by
between 30 percent and 40 percent.</P>

      <P>A political party formed by some of former
President Lee Teng-hui's followers was formally inaugurated Sunday,
with a written congratulatory message from President Chen Shui-bian
read out at the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Chen lauded the Taiwan Solidarity Union's (TSU's) goals of
"stabilizing the political situation, reinvigorating the economy,
deepening democracy and strengthening Taiwan," as a benefit to
Taiwan's development of party politics.</P>
      <P>Noting that democracy is politics based on political parties,
Chen said he looks forward to cooperation with the TSU to improve the
island's democracy and advance the country's development.</P>
      <P>The TSU, designed to solidify former President Lee Teng-hui's
political legacy and cement Chen's minority government, approved its
party charter Sunday and elected former Minister of the Interior
Huang Chu-wen, who is said to have acted as Lee Teng-hui's frontman
in setting up the party, as its chairman.</P>
      <P>Lee, who is said to have worked behind the scenes for the party's
foundation and is touted as its "spiritual leader", gave a speech at
the inauguration.</P>
      <P>The former president and opposition Kuomintang chairman said in
Taiwanese that the party politics prevailing on the island has
deviated from the sound development of democracy and has damaged the
island's economy.</P>
      <P>He blamed the island's political instability on the partisan
politics in which political parties give priority to their own
political interests in defiance of public opinion.</P>
      <P>Lee said the foundation of the TSU marks the awareness of the
"silent public" who are fed up with the political parties and the
opposition-controlled legislature, which are at the epicenter of the
island's political instability.</P>
      <P>Huang echoed Lee's view, denouncing party politics and the
legislature for hindering rather than advancing democracy. He vowed
to revamp the legislature by nominating 39 candidates to vie for
seats in the year-end legislative elections.</P>

Aug. 15 in commemoration of the end of World War II.</P>
      <P>Lu noted that although the United Nations has not admitted
Taiwan, the island has opened a door to the world peace and added
that it's her belief that the U.N. will "soon open its doors to
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is not a troublemaker, but a peacemaker," Lu said, adding
that Taiwan will demonstrate with action that it is more qualified
than some U.N. members to join the organization.</P>
      <P>"In addition to trying hard to join the U.N., we should let the
world know that without Taiwan, it will be a great loss for U.N.," Lu
added.</P>
      <P>Lester Wolff, a former United States congressman who participated
in drawing up the Taiwan Relations Act, said at the party that the
series of activities initiated by Lu are "quite important" for world
peace.</P>
      <P>Six Nobel Peace Prize winners, 14 congressmen and
parliamentarians from the U.S. and Japan, and the heads of 11
international NGOs, have been invited to participate in the
activities.</P>
      <P>The event is scheduled to begin Aug. 14, with a world peace forum
convened Aug. 15-16, where the participants will discuss matters
related to cross-Taiwan Strait relations, security and stability in
the Asia Pacific region, experiences in world war and peace
activities, crisis and perspectives of peace between the two sides of
Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE PRESIDENT ON CROSS-STRAIT TIES  (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  12  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Saturday
that she sees a strong undercurrent in cross-strait relations, in
spite of the fact that ties have appeared to be "relatively stable"
as a result of the toned-down rhetoric by the leaders of both sides.</P>
      <P>She said that Beijing has now adopted a "two-pronged" approach
toward Taiwan -- aggressively luring Taiwan businesses to investment
in the mainland on one hand and continuing its military build-up to
threaten Taiwan on the other.</P>
      <P>Judging from this two-handed policy, the "seemingly relatively
stable relations now do not necessarily assure calm and peaceful ties
in the future," Lu warned.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks in an interview with CNA during which the
first female vice president of the Republic of China gave her views
on a wide range of issues, including the opening of direct postal,
trade and transportation links between Taiwan and the mainland,
Taiwan's lifting of its restriction on mainland China-bound
investment, the year-end elections of lawmakers and local government
heads, Taiwan's foreign relations and the "Voice from Taiwan, Peace
and Love" campaign that Lu personally initiated.</P>
      <P>Six Nobel Peace Prize winners, including former Polish President
Lech Walesa, Oscar Arias Sanchez, who served as Costa Rica's
president from 1986 to 1990, former South African President F.W. de
Clerk and Betty Williams, a peace advocate from Ireland, have been
invited to take part in the event.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Nobel Prize winners, lawmakers and
parliamentarians from many friendly nations and chief executive
officers from 11 NGO groups have agreed to take part in the "Voice
from Taiwan" drive, which will feature a 2001 Global Peace Assembly
forum scheduled for Aug. 15-16 and an Evening for Global Peace slated
for Aug. 15.</P>
      <P>Following is the a text of Lu's interview:</P>
      <P>Q: How would you view the development of cross-strait ties
following Beijing's successful 2008 Olympic bid?</P>
      <P>A: It's better for the leaders of both sides to reduce their
exchanges of rhetoric, letting ties become relatively calm. But by
doing only that will not necessarily mean that relations will then
run smoothly.</P>
      <P>I think that Beijing has applied a hard-and-soft two-handed
policy to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Beijing has been especially successful in launching its "soft"
offensive, or "economic war" against Taiwan, by attracting a large
amount of Taiwan investment to the mainland, causing substantial
damage to Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Beijing has deployed 350 missiles, over 100
Su-27 and Su-30 fighters at air bases just 250 nautical miles away
from Taiwan, along with another 700 fighters in bases some 600
nautical miles from the island, in addition to accelerating its
development of cruise missiles.</P>
      <P>I have therefore initiated the "Voice from Taiwan, Peace and
Love" campaign by inviting world leaders to attend a peace forum in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>I believe that the dignitaries attending the forum will help air
Taiwan's desire for peace at the United Nations and other
international occasions.</P>
      <P>I would also like to urge that the people of Taiwan, while
touring the mainland to visit relatives, do business, or whatever, to
appeal to "every mainland person they meet to dismantle the missiles
aimed at Taiwan."</P>
      <P>By so doing, the mainland people will finally come to understand
that they would benefit much if Beijing would use the missile
development money to take care of them.

    <HEADLINE>VICE PRESIDENT LU ON CROSS-STRAIT TIES (II)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  12  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Q: What is your viewpoint about the easing of the "no haste, be
patient" mainland investment policy and on the establishment of the
direct "three links," which are being discussed by the current panel
meeting of the Economic Development Advisory Conference?</P>
      <P>A: I think the requirement for all mainland-bound investment
projects worth more than US$50 million to be first approved by the
government on a case-by-case basis is the key point to the current
government regulations governing Taiwan investment in the mainland.
All those people who have urged the government to remove the
restriction may harbor a desire to investment there without any
limits.</P>
      <P>If the US$50 million belongs only to one person, nobody has any
right to criticize. But the capital of most investors comes from bank
loans, which are collected from public savings. Should all this
investment money be changed into renminbi, it is by no means a
personal issue. The government must weigh whether it should allow
such practices, and the holding of a public referendum should be the
best way to decide it.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the government should take measures to control
capital outflow and bank loans efficiently and it should also drop
the "no haste, be patient" slogan, which is too difficult for the
public to understand. The public will easily get it if the government
asks directly whether mainland-bound investment projects worth more
than US$50 million should be allowed.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, I am not opposed to Taiwan's opening of
direct transport ties with mainland China, because it is unreasonable
and inconvenient for mainland-bound Taiwan travelers to transfer in
Hong Kong or Macau. I think it would be ideal to designate an airport
on the offshore Penghu Island to serve as a direct-link airport
between Taiwan and mainland China due to the island's location at the
mid-point of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>If the government studied the issue seriously in that direction,
it should and must talk with the Beijing authorities when the time is
ripe. I think Penghu is a good location to serve as a base for direct
aviation links between the two sides and would be better than any
airport in Taipei or Taoyuan.</P>
      <P>Q: What do you think of the year-end legislative elections?</P>
      <P>A: I am very tired of taking part in elections. As Taiwan has
developed into a democracy, holding elections have become a common
practice and the people in Taiwan should see the matter with a
"business as usual" attitude.</P>
      <P>I think Taiwan society has wasted too much resources on
elections. Taking part in elections is a personal issue for each and
all candidates, but too much coverage by the media has in turn become
an election campaign for certain candidates. Some candidates have
totally forgotten their responsibility of seeking benefits for their
supporters, concentrating instead on media grandstanding.</P>
      <P>I have participated in five elections and was elected every time.
But I will not do so again, because it is a hard task.</P>
      <P>Q: What objectives do you wish to achieve by launching the "Voice
from Taiwan, Peace and Love" series of activities, in which several
international figures and Nobel Price winners are expected to take
part?</P>
      <P>A: This campaign is supported by United Nations-affiliated Non
Government Organizations (NGOs). In addition to the chairman of the
NGO's world chapter, who will personally attend the activities in
Taiwan, the heads of 11 international organizations, as well as 14
parliamentary members from six countries, will also travel to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting that two parliamentarians from Thailand
decided to participate in the event despite opposition from Beijing.
This is proof that we can still cement Taiwan's ties with other
countries without going abroad. At the same time, it is also worth
noting that the chief of the Inside the U.N. television station --
the sole television station under the U.N. -- will also visit Taiwan
for the rally.</P>
      <P>Each of the six Nobel Peace Prize winners who are to arrive in
Taiwan for the activities have an outstanding background. For
instance, former Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez has
contributed to harmony and integration among the countries of Central
America and helped found the System of Central American Integration.
Taiwan, Japan and South Korea should learn from his example by
forging an Asia-Pacific Alliance.</P>
      <P>Many democracy activists, as well as President Chen Shui-bian and
myself, also admire very much former Polish President Lech Walesa,
who overthrew Poland's communist regime with the Solidarity Union set
by himself.</P>

      <P>Former South African President F.W. de Clerk also enjoys
worldwide recognition for his admirable transfer of power from the
white minority to the black majority and that is the reason why de
Clerk is slated to deliver a speech immediately after former
President Lee Teng-hui at the opening of the Global Peace Assembly.</P>
      <P>I believe that transferring power is very different from seeking
power and de Clerk's attendance carries a very significant meaning,
which provides an opportunity for the people of Taiwan to realize the
true meaning of the term "transfer of power."</P>
      <P>The other three Nobel Peace Prize winners, although not heads of
state, have also accomplished remarkable achievements.</P>
      <P>Betty Williams, who was originally an ordinary housewife, stood
up bravely to the British troops after seeing the North Ireland
independence activists cruelly crushed by tanks of the British
troops. Her presence here is to remind the public that peace can also
be achieved through such means.</P>
      <P>Joseph Rotblat, a 93-year-old scientist, will also visit Taiwan
to join us in the series of activities. Rotblat, a former specialist
dedicated to the development of the atomic bomb during World War II,
is now committed to the anti-nuclear movement and demilitarization
campaigns. His willingness to take part in our activities has deeply
touched us.</P>
      <P>There are two more interesting people coming. One is Park Sir
Young, daughter of former South Korean President Park Chung Hee.</P>
      <P>Although Park senior is a controversial person in South Korea, he
is still a spiritual leader for many South Korean people according to
my friend over there, therefore we invited his daughter to join us.</P>
      <P>Another interesting person is the daughter-in-law of former
Indian President Varahagiri Venkata Giri, who is now a minister for
women's affairs.</P>
      <P>Another of the dignitaries, whose name I prefer to withhold,
served once as the chairman of the United Nations General Assembly
session and was appointed to a vital position by his government last
week. The announcement of his new appointment has been delayed until
after his visit to Taipei.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have so many foreign dignitaries to grace the
occasion, but I regret that many of my fellow countrymen lack
confidence in our country.</P>
      <P>Just as "people with integrity will never be isolated," a
peace-loving and democratic Taiwan with compassion and respect for
human rights will find allies around the world.</P>
      <P>Many of my critics ridicule me in that my words speak louder than
my actions, but I have delivered on my pledges one by one and they
will have to admit that it is right to describe Taiwan as a gentle
and friendly country.</P>
      <P>I think it is the will of heaven to have so many dignitaries
descend on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Actually there are two more dignitaries who want to attend the
occasion but we could not accommodate them because of our strapped
budget and the fact that they gave too little notice. They will have
to wait until next time.</P>
      <P>As to the budget for the event, estimated at about NT$20 million
(about US$5.88 million), it has been raised by the private sector
since the government turned down our requests for assistance.</P>
      <P>The peace forum will consist of three parts, beginning with a
brief from the government on the current cross-strait situation and a
visit by the foreign dignitaries to the frontline island of Kinmen,
followed by a discussion for foreign scholars on peace in Asia and
wrapped up with a recounting by the foreign dignitaries of their
experiences in pushing for peace.</P>
      <P>The forum will try to work out a way for a persistent peace
across the Taiwan Straits and give out a message that Taiwan is a
peacemaker rather than a troublemaker.</P>
      <P>Q: Do you have any plans for overseas trips in the near future?
It is said that you will travel abroad in October.</P>
      <P>A: I have no plans to visit foreign countries in October. I am
busy organizing the world peace forum.</P>
      <P>In my view, any overseas trip has to meet two criteria. First, it
has to be conducted with dignity and second, it must serve Taiwan's
diplomatic interests.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIC PANEL SUGGESTS EASING OF MAINLAND INVESTMENT (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 12 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Participants in a preparatory meeting of a
major economic conference suggested Sunday that the government ease
its restrictions on investing in mainland China.</P>
      <P>The participants in the meeting on cross-strait affairs
panel reached consensus on several major issues in the fourth and last
panel meeting before the opening of the Economic Development Advisory
Conference (EDAC) in late August.</P>
      <P>They agreed on several major cross-strait trade issues based on
the principles of "Taiwan be given first priority, global planning,
mutually beneficial cross-strait relations, and risk management."</P>
      <P>The issues were related to the opening of cross-strait trade and
investment, the establishment of a cross-strait capital flow
mechanism, the entry into the World Trade Organization by both sides
of the Taiwan Strait, direct cross-strait trade, postal and transport
links, the establishment of a special economic zone and the opening
of Taiwan to tourists from the mainland.</P>
      <P>Although the participants agreed largely on the trade issues,
they had heated debate on cross-strait talks and drafted a written
statement only after lengthy discussion.</P>
      <P>The panel finally wrote that the government should forge a
national consensus in line with the spirit of the ROC Constitution,
should shelve political disputes to allow dialogue with the mainalnd
soon, and should hold talks with the mainland on direct trade, postal
and transport links and other issues related to the welfare of the
public.</P>
      <P>As the panelists could not agree on the so-called "1992
consensus" of "one China, separate interpretations" between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait, they said the government should forge a
national consensus to solve the differences.</P>
      <P>The panel will present its agreements for discussion by EDAC,
which will convene Aug. 24-26.</P>
      <P>On the opening of cross-strait trade and investment, the panel
suggested the current "go slow, be patient" policy toward investing
in the mainland be changed to "active opening and effective
management" based on the principle of "global planning and strategic
opening."</P>
      <P>The "go slow" policy, advocated by former President Lee Teng-hui
in 1996, bars Taiwan manufacturers from investing in the
infrastructure and high-tech industry in the mainland, and puts a
US$50 million investment cap on individual investment projects.</P>
      <P>The panel suggested that a team comprised of government, industry
and academic figures be set up to regularly review the easing of
restrictions on which industries should be allowed to invest in the
mainland and to promote the signing of a cross-strait investment
guarantee agreement and a tax pact.</P>
      <P>The panel also suggested the establishment of a healthy inflow
mechanism for money invested in the mainland, the development of an
offshore banking unit (OBU) as a capital financing center for Taiwan
businessmen overseas and in the mainland, and an assessment of the
opening of local banks designated as foreign currency operators to
have direct remittance services with financial institutions in the
mainland.</P>
      <P>The panel also suggested allowing the financial service industry
to invest in the mainland and the establishment of branches or
subsidiaries to provide assistance to Taiwan businessmen wanting to
withdraw from the mainland, as well as allowing mainland capital to
be invested in Taiwan's land and real estate market. It also
suggested a gradual opening of the securities market in Taiwan to
mainland capital and the assessment of the feasibility of
establishing an overseas capital market.

      <P>On the entry of the WTO by the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
expected later this year, the panel suggested that in line with the
progress of WTO entry, the government should open direct trade,
postal and transport links with the mainland and further open the
local market to mainland products if the mainland will lower its
trade barriers.</P>
      <P>It also suggested that the government take an overall plan for
cross-strait shipping and put it into practice through cross-strait
discussion. Before the two sides of the Taiwan Strait sign a direct
shipping agreement, it said, some transitional measures should be
taken, including the expansion of functions of offshore transshipping
centers, opening of the commodity flow, allowing private shipping
operators to discuss with their mainland counterparts for business
cooperation, and assessments on the establishment of special trade
and economic zones.</P>
      <P>The panel also said that Taiwan should open to tourism from the
mainland and should discuss with the mainland authorities the timing
of such opening. If necessary, the opening could be put into
practice on a trial basis, the panel added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou and his
Fukuoka counterpart Hirotaro Yamasaki agreed over a breakfast meeting
Monday to step up exchanges between their two cities.</P>
      <P>Yamasaki led several city officials to the hotel where Ma was
staying to take part in a breakfast meeting where the two mayors
exchanged views on city administration.</P>
      <P>The Fukuoka mayor expressed keen interest in visiting high-tech
facilities in Taiwan, especially the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial
Park in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma, for his part, invited Yamasaki to visit a computer software
industrial park in Nankang in suburban Taipei, saying that Nankang's
"software information industry" and Hsinchu Science-based Industrial
Park's "hardware industry" each have their own distinctive features.</P>
      <P>Yamasaki gladly accepted the invitation and said he will work out
related matters later.</P>
      <P>The two mayors also reached consensus on student and artist
exchanges between Taipei and Fukuoka, as well as on trade and
high-tech exchanges.</P>
      <P>After the breakfast meeting, Ma visited the city's museum and
harbor facilities as well as its "island city" which is presently
under construction. In the afternoon, he visited a computer software
research and development park and the Dome Stadium.</P>
      <P>He is scheduled to attend a dinner party later in the day hosted
by the Fukuoka Branch of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in
Osaka.</P>
      <P>Ma on Saturday began a five-day visit to Fukuoka, the final leg
of his current three-city tour in Asia. The first two stops on his

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi
left for Vietnam Monday to attend an annual conference on promoting
trade and economic cooperation between the Republic of China and the
Indochinese country.</P>
      <P>This was the eighth consecutive year that major trade
organizations in the two countries have jointly organized the
meeting to boost bilateral economic ties.</P>
      <P>Lin headed a delegation of Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
officials, including Vice Minister Chen Ruey-long, and senior
business executives to attend the conference.</P>
      <P>During his visit, Lin will also tour a Hanoi industrial park
developed by Taiwan business groups and meet with Taiwan investors in
Vietnam to gain a better understanding of their operations there. Lin
is scheduled to return to Taiepi Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties, ROC-Vietnamese
economic relations have been growing steadily. Taiwan is now
Vietnam's fourth largest trading partner.</P>
      <P>With their geographic proximity and similar cultural
backgrounds, MOEA officials said, the two countries should have many
new opportunities to cooperate in the future.</P>
      <P>According to MOEA tallies, two-way trade between the ROC and
Vietnam amounted to US$2.12 billion last year, with Taiwan exporting
US$1.66 billion worth of goods to Vietnam while importing US$460
million worth of Vietnamese products.</P>
      <P>Taiwan mainly exported semi-finished textile goods, leather,
footwear parts and processing machines to Vietnam, while raw
materials, farm produce and semi-finished products formed the bulk
of imports from Vietnam.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRADE OFFICIAL CAUTIONS AGAINST INVESTMENT RISKS IN M'LAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  13  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A trade official suggested Monday that
Taiwan investors interested in making investments across the Taiwan
Strait should study the market situation more carefully and avoid
putting money in sectors or regions with excessive investments.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-peng, secretary-general of the China External Trade
Development Council and former director of the Economics Ministry's
Industrial Development and Investment Center, said that Taiwan
investors should take into consideration the political environment,
basic infrastructure, distribution of public resources, sales
channels, the balance of supply and demand, as well as personnel
costs and factory sites before investing.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by mainland Chinese authorities show that
Taiwan investors have set up at least 46,000 companies on the
mainland, although the official figure released by Taiwan authorities
is around 23,000.</P>
      <P>As for the investment amount, official figures released by Taiwan
authorities show that between 1991 and 2000, Taiwan investors poured
US$17.1 billion into the mainland market. Mainland China's official
figure for the amount is around US$50 billion, while the private
sector in Taiwan estimates the amount at between US$80 billion and
US$100 billion.</P>
      <P>Being the world's seventh largest economy and the eighth largest
trading country, mainland China has become a magnet for foreign
capital. Taiwan's business and industrial sectors have also stepped
up their pace to win themselves footholds in the huge market.</P>
      <P>Huang said that mainland China offers certain investment
advantages, but added that investors should recognize the fact that
many foreign investors have failed in mainland China in the years
past due to the lack of transparency and the unexpected costs that
ambiguous regulations have entailed.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, businesspeople from Taiwan, after having
spent years managing their businesses on the mainland, know better
the principles governing business on the mainland, according to
a mainland affairs specialist.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan businesspeople have worked out a three-part
principle -- the first part being basic capability; the second being
no involvement in politics and no violation of regulations; and the
third part being good relations with the local governments, good
contacts with authorities on both sides of the strait, and good
public relations.</P>
      <P>The specialist added that accessing the mainland market is by no
means easier than accessing markets in other parts of the world.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP WILL LEAD IN YEAR-END LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS: e-SOCIETY POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  13  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will gain the most votes but will still be unable to garner
over half the total ballots cast in the year-end legislative
elections, according to the results of a poll released Monday.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 1,068 eligible voters randomly selected
from around the island, conducted by e-Society Research Group over
the weekend, found that none of major domestic political parties will
secure more than half of the total vote.</P>
      <P>The survey results showed that the DPP will receive 33.7 percent
of the vote, slightly higher than the 30.5 percent share that will be
seized by the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>According to the poll, the three other opposition parties' shares
of the vote will be 21.15 percent, 2.8 percent, and 2.6 percent for
the People First Party (PFP), the newly formed Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU), and the pro-unification New Party (NP), respectively.</P>
      <P>e-Society President Ho Sun Sea told a news conference that the
vote ratios were estimated on each party's overall competitiveness
which was measured on public perceptions of party image and ruling
capabilities.</P>
      <P>In the party image evaluation, five indicators -- heed to public
opinion, integrity, leadership performance, candidate qualifications
and efforts to promote ethnic harmony -- were gauged.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the DPP led in three categories -- heed to public
opinion, integrity and candidate qualifications, while the PFP
outshone other parties in leadership performance and ethnic harmony
promotion.</P>
      <P>The erstwhile ruling and now opposition KMT ranked in the middle
in all indicators studied except for the "integrity" category in
which the KMT tied the TSU for last place. Another noteworthy finding
was that the NP ranked second in the "integrity" category.</P>
      <P>In the e-Society poll, each party's ruling capabilities were
gauged in terms of five indicators -- improving the economy and
cross-Taiwan Strait relations, defending Taiwan's rights and
interests, administrative ability and party identification.</P>
      <P>The survey found that the KMT topped all other parties in the
categories of improving the economy and cross-strait ties and
administrative ability, while the DPP led in defending Taiwan's
rights and interests, and the PFP ranked first in party
identification.</P>
      <P>Based on all of the above-mentioned factors, the DPP received the
highest approval rating in terms of overall party competitiveness at
28 percent, followed by the KMT at 26.7 percent, the PFP at 17.8
percent, the TSU at 2.3 percent and the NP at 1.9 percent.</P>
      <P>Quoting the results of three similar polls conducted by e-Society
from Jan. 18-Aug. 10, Ho said both the DPP's and the PFP's "party
identification" rating showed a moderate declining trend, while the
KMT's surged from 11.6 percent to 16.6 percent during the same
period.</P>
      <P>In terms of support ratings of the candidates of the various
parties, the DPP still leads with a rating of 26 percent, followed by
the PFP's 19.3 percent, the KMT's 18.9 percent, the NP's 2.8 percent
and the TSU's 2.7 percent.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 60.5 percent of the respondents who
voted for DPP candidate Chen Shui-bian in the 2000 presidential
election would still cast ballots for DPP nominees in the year-end
elections, but 5.7 percent said they would switch to back TSU
candidates.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 54.9 percent of the respondents who voted for KMT
candidate Lien Chan in the last presidential election would continue
to back KMT standard-bearers, while 8.1 percent said they would
switch their ballots to PFP candidates and 3.1 percent said they
would throw their support behind TSU nominees.</P>
      <P>Among those who voted for PFP Chairman James Soong in the
previous presidential election, 51.1 percent said they would opt for
PFP candidates in the year-end race, but 20.8 percent said they would
cast ballots for KMT hopefuls, while none of them would support TSU
candidates.</P>
      <P>Asked whether they were satisfied with the various parties'
performances, 24.3 percent said they are dissatisfied with the
performances of all major domestic parties, while 33.8 percent said
they have no opinion. The survey results also showed that the DPP's
approval rating stands at 16.5 percent, compared to the KMT's 11.7
percent and the KMT's 11 percent.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the survey results, professor Liu Yi-chou said that as
Taiwan's party development has plunged to a low ebb, candidate's
personal image, capabilities and qualifications will be critical in
deciding whether they can win in the year-end legislative elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MONETARY RECONSTRUCTION MEASURES WON'T LEAD TO CRISIS: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  13  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The operations of the 36 local monetary
institutions under the financial authorities' supervision were normal
on Monday, the first working day after special task force personnel
were assigned to the institutions to check on their management.</P>
      <P>The Monetary Reconstruction Fund-initiated action last Friday
exposed the problems of many monetary institutions with negative net
assets. In taking the action, the financial authorities were
preparing against the worst-case scenario of a run on banks while
giving full guarantees concerning the rights and benefits of all
deposit accounts.</P>
      <P>Chen Hsi-huang, chairman of the Council of Agriculture, said that
he does not anticipate that the emergency measures against the
problem monetary institutions, which are mostly affiliated with
farmers or fishermen's associations, will bring a tempest to the
fundamental monetary system.</P>
      <P>He said that the credit departments of the farmers or fishermen's
associations have been playing an important role in Taiwan's
fundamental monetary system. The 314 such credit departments located
around the island and on Taiwan's offshore islands have been
providing the agricultural community with services considered too
trivial even for regional banks.</P>
      <P>The accumulated deposits at the 314 credit departments exceed
NT$1,200 billion and the small loans extended by them amount to some
NT$800 billion, according to the official.</P>
      <P>He said that the fundamental monetary system of the agricultural
sector remains stable, although many of the credit departments of the
farmers or fishermen's associations have negative net assets.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the Council of Agriculture show that 21 of
the credit departments have negative net assets, while another 29 are
on the brink of having negative assets.</P>
      <P>The 50 institutions will be given three years to improve their
management. If all attempted remedies fail, the institutions will
then be forced to be merged, according to the agricultural official.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXPERT OF U.S. THINK TANK MAY TAKE OVER AS AIT CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  12 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>American Institute in Taiwan Chairman
Richard Bush will step down this autumn, and the man who is most
likely to succeed him is Larry M. Wortzel, an expert at the Heritage
Foundation, sources in Washington said.</P>
      <P>The sources noted that Wortzel, the director of the U.S. think
tank's Asian Studies Center, who served as an assistant army attache
in mainalnd China during the time of the Tiananmen Massacre, has
become the major candidate for the post.</P>
      <P>But a Bush administration source also said that Wortzel could
also serve as AIT's Taipei office director, with Douglas Paal, who
was earlier reported to be appointed to serve as AIT Taipei director,
being stationed in the AIT headquarters in Washington.</P>
      <P>The sources said that Paal has been attacked by some
conservatives for his views, pointing out that although Assistant
Secretary of State James Kelly is supportive of Paal, senators Jesse
Helms (R-N.C.) and Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) had sent letters to President
Bush questioning Paal's appointment.</P>
      <P>Compared with Republican conservatives, Paal's stance on
cross-strait relations has been considered to be too neutral and his
opposition to the Communist Chinese regime not strong enough. His
criticism of the Bush administration's China policy has also given
some a reason to attack him, sources said.</P>
      <P>A Bush administration source said that the current AIT chairman
is likely to step down after President Bush's visit to mainland China
later this year. But before his resignation, Richard Bush is expected
to visit Taiwan to brief Taipei on the contents of President Bush's
mainland trip and to bid farewell to the officials there.</P>
      <P>Bush assumed the AIT chairmanship in September 1997 and has since
commanded high respect from both Taipei and Washington, but sources
said that he is a Democrat and has served for four years already and
the Bush administration is hoping that a Republican will take over
the post.</P>
      <P>Wortzel, who maintains an anti-Communist stance, specializes in
East Asian politics and is an expert on mainland China's military
development and diplomatic affairs.</P>
      <P>He is friendly toward Taiwan and has said that he does not think
it is right for the United States to allow major congressional
committee chairmen to visit Taiwan while restricting
politically-appointed officials and high-ranking military officials
from visiting the island.</P>
      <P>Serving as a colonel before retiring from the U.S. Army three
years ago, Wortzel was offered an opportunity to visit Taiwan before
his retirement, but the State Department expressed its opposition to
the visit at a sensitive time when then U.S. President Bill Clinton
was visiting mainland China.</P>
      <P>Wortzel is a graduate of the Armed Forces Staff College and the
U.S. Army War College, and he attended the National University of
Singapore. He earned his bachelor's degree from Columbus College,
Georgia, and his master's as well as his doctoral degree from the
University of Hawaii.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung reaffirmed Monday
the government's commitment to fully implementing any consensus or
conclusions reached at the soon-to-be-convened Economic Development
Advisory Conference (EDAC).</P>
      <P>Chang made the reaffirmation at the inauguration ceremony for the
Cross-Strait Economic and Trade Association, a new body formed by a
group of opposition Kuomintang legislators to promote commercial
exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chang said the EDAC is mainly designed to provide a forum for the
ruling and opposition parties, as well as private commerce and
industry executives, to exchange views on major domestic economic
problems, including cross-strait trade and investment affairs.</P>
      <P>"So any consensus reached at the conference will be implemented,"
Chang stressed, adding that consensus forged through candid
discussions between the ruling and opposition parties tends to be
easier to implement.</P>
      <P>Noting that cross-strait relations have been a major concern in
the Republic of China's sustainable national development, Chang said
the government has been handling relevant issues with great prudence.</P>
      <P>At the present stage, Chang said, the government is conducting a
comprehensive, multi-dimensional review of its policy toward
cross-strait affairs.</P>
      <P>"And we'll continue to promote cross-strait relations in a
pragmatic manner under the premises of national security, economic
development and public well-being," Chang pledged.</P>
      <P>He went on to say the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should forge
rapprochement based on the principles of parity and dignity and
replace confrontation with cooperation. He urged mainland China to
resume regular cross-strait dialogue to discuss constructive ways to
promote mutually beneficial ties as early as possible.</P>
      <P>In view of the existing difficulties in cross-strait
government-to-government communication, Chang said he is pleased to
see the formation of the Cross-Strait Economic and Trade Association
that will offer services to the large number of Taiwan entrepreneurs
who have invested in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of official cross-strait communication
channels, Chang said, the government will also make continued efforts
to offer necessary assistance to Taiwan investors in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislator Ho Chi-hui, who concurrently heads the
Cross-Strait Economic and Trade Association, said the newly
inaugurated organization will set up offices in major mainland
Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Qingdao, Guangzhou,
Shenzhen and Xiamen, to better serve Taiwan businesspeople there.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT TO EXPEL PARTY MEMBERS WHO JOIN TSU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  13  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition Kuomintang (KMT) spokesman
said Monday that 12 KMT members are among the 39 prospective
candidates who will run on the ticket of the just-established Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) in December's legislative elections.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the KMT Evaluation and Discipline Committee
would convene a meeting Tuesday to "expel" them from the party in
accordance with party regulations.</P>
      <P>Local newspapers had reported that of the 39 TSU candidates, 19
belonged to the KMT, but a check by the party found that seven of the
named candidates had not registered as KMT members at the end of last
year, which means they had already lost their KMT memberships.</P>
      <P>Although eight of the candidates issued statements Monday to
announce their party resignations, a KMT official said that just
making an announcement or mailing back the party certificates do not
comply with the procedures for quitting the party.</P>
      <P>Spokesman Wang Chih-kang stated the day before that all party
members will be expelled if they join other parties.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Chairman Lien Chan said Monday that the Evaluation
and Discipline Committee will consider how to deal with the behavior
and remarks of former KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Lee was invited to speak at the inauguration of the TSU. He also
openly voiced his support for the TSU candidates.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA PROTESTS BEIJING'S REMARKS ON ROC'S U.N. BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  13  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
issued a press release Monday protesting mainland China's remarks on
the Republic of China's bid to join the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The ministry said its press statement that the ROC and the
People's Republic of China have co-existed on the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait for more than 50 years.</P>
      <P>Noting that the two sides have different political systems,
social values and external relations, the ministry said, the ROC and
the PRC are neither subject to each other nor represent each other.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the ministry said, mainland China's claim
that Taiwan is a province under the PRC and thus has not rights to
join the United Nations is a serious deviation from the fact and a
self-deceit trick.</P>
      <P>The ministry further said U.N. Resolution No. 2758, adopted in
1971, which gave the China seat to mainland China at the expense of
the ROC grossly violated the principles of fairness and justice and
the United Nations' own principle of membership universality.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC is a constructive, responsible member of the
international community, the ministry said, the ROC has every
legitimate right to join the United Nations and other international
organizations.</P>
      <P>If mainalnd China continues to block Taiwan's presence in the
world arena, the ministry said, mainland China would only draw
backlash from the 23 million people of Taiwan and the large
number of overseas Chinese people who are concerned about Taiwan's
well-being. Mainland China's opposition would also hurt relations
across the Taiwan Strait, the ministry said, adding that mainland
leaders should pragmatically face up to the reality of the ROC's
continued existence in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's U.N. delegation voiced opposition to Taiwan's
U.N. bid in a press conference on Aug. 9 after 10 of ROC diplomatic
allies filed a proposal Aug. 7 with the U.N. Secretariat urging the
U.N. General Assembly to set up a task force to study Taiwan's
desire for a U.N. seat.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CEPD HEAD: GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE TO REGULATE MAINLAND INVESTMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 13 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Amid media reports that the Executive Yuan
will move to ease the current mainland China investment policy, a
government official said Monday that the government will adopt a
"total amount control" to regulate future Taiwan capital outflow to
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Council of Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) Chairman Chen
Po-chih dismissed the reports by clarifying that the government will
"rationally" relax relevant rules on future mainland-bound investment
by Taiwan firms while seeking to prevent a side effect of "capital
hollow-out."</P>
      <P>The CEPD chief made the remarks while answering reporters'
questions during the interval of a seminar on Taiwan's industrial
upgrading.</P>
      <P>According to local media, the Executive Yuan called a meeting
recently in which it was decided that a restriction covered in the
present "no haste, be patient" mainland investment policy -- the ban
on single investment plans worth over US$50 million -- will be lifted
and replaced by a "total amount control" on each company's investment
volume in the mainland in compliance with the current regulations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen
confirmed that the Cabinet called a meeting on cross-strait trade and
investment policy but failed to make any final decision.</P>
      <P>As to a proposal raised a day earlier by a panel meeting of the
Economic Development Advisory Conference (EDAC) urging the government
to remove the ban on each mainland-bound investment plan worth more
than US$50 million, Tsai said the government will conduct
"substantial screenings" on such investment plans in the future in
order to gain an understanding as to whether they are necessary or
whether they would have serious implications for Taiwan's capital
movements.</P>
      <P>The MAC chairwoman noted that the government has different
screening processes for different investment thresholds and called on
the public "not to take the matter too seriously." She added that
consensus reached at the EDAC will serve as the government's policy
framework.</P>
      <P>Regarding speculation that the government will lift the mainland
investment ceiling on funds collected by companies from the local
stock market and the over-the-counter market from the current level
of 20 percent to 40 percent and that the government is projecting to
open six ports for direct cargo shipping ties with mainland China,
Tsai said only that "nothing has been settled."</P>
      <P>Turning to a warning issued by National Security Bureau Director
Ting Yu-chou that Beijing is attempting to use an economic approach
to push for Taiwan's unification with the mainland and a recent
mention by President Chen Shui-bian of a cross-strait economic war,
Tsai claimed that "it is unlikely that the situation between the two
sides will reach such a point."</P>
      <P>"The economies of the two sides are complementary to each other
and the mutually beneficial exchanges were viewed as the basic
principle of cross-strait economic activities during the EDAC panel
meeting," she stressed.</P>
      <P>Tsai admitted that national security should be considered in
cross-strait economic activities but she also made it clear that
Taiwan-mainland trade and investment activities are permitted, as
long as all possible risks are assessed in advance.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  13  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A lawmaker of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) called on the Executive Yuan Monday to take
precautions against what he claimed is "Beijing's scheme to achieve
political goals by means of commerce."</P>
      <P>According to Tsai Huang-liang, party whip of the DPP caucus at
the Legislative Yuan, Beijing plans to downgrade Taiwan to the status
of Hong Kong by using economic means.</P>
      <P>He called on the Cabinet to map out counter-measures in fields
related to national security, social stability and the stabilization
of financial and monetary order before Taiwan is admitted into the
World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Tsai quoted Ting Yu-chou, director of the National Security
Bureau (NSB), as reporting that Beijing is studying a so-called "one
country four districts" and a "one country, four legal systems"
formula as an economic means of achieving unification with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ting reported Beijing's scheme Sunday when he briefed a
closed-door meeting of the cross-strait panel of the upcoming
Economic Development Advisory Conference (EDAC) slated for late
August.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the purpose of Beijing's new economic united
front move is to use business to put pressure on the Republic of
China government so as to force Taiwan to accept Beijing's "one
country, two systems" proposal.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the Cabinet will do whatever it can to implement
the consensus reached at the upcoming EDAC. Nevertheless, the Cabinet
should also adopt precautions against Beijing's repeated attempts to
downgrade Taiwan politically.</P>
      <P>Tsai also suggested that the Cabinet should take necessary
measures to speed up the building of Taiwan into a global operations
center, to map out measures to protect local industry and to cope
with the dumping of mainland-produced commodities coming into Taiwan
as WTO entry draws near.</P>

      <P>The Las Vegas-based MGM Group is
interested in a development plan for Tapeng Bay in the southern
Taiwan county of Pingtung, Republic of China Transportation and
Communications Minister Yeh Chu-lan said here Sunday.</P>
      <P>Yeh, who is visiting the United States to attract foreign
investment for Taiwan's tourist market, said the MGM Group has
decided to dispatch officials in late September or early October to
assess the Tapeng Bay recreational center project, despite the fact
that she has set a precondition that no gambling facilities will be
allowed in the compound.</P>
      <P>The MGM Group enjoys a leadership role in the local casino
business in Las Vegas after having taken over the management of the
classy Bellagio and Mirage casino hotels. It is understood that the
group sent personnel to Penghu Island last year to study the
possibility of creating a gambling center there.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by ROC officials stationed in San Francisco, Yeh also
called at several casino hotels and tourist spots in Las Vegas to
study how the city has succeeded in building such a big tourist
empire in the sands of the Nevada desert. She was slated to pay a

    <TEXT>
      <P>A new study
released Monday shows that approximately one-fourth of the nation's
1.76 million middle school, high school and vocational school
students frequent the ubiquitous Internet cafes at least once a week.</P>
      <P>According to the study, which surveyed a random sampling of
students in 129 schools nationwide, about half of the 9,305
respondents said that they had been to an Internet cafe at least
once.</P>
      <P>Approximately 7.2 percent of the respondents -- which works out
to the equivalent of approximately 127,000 students nationwide --
said that they frequent Internet cafes at least three times a week.</P>
      <P>The students on average stay in the cafes for a whopping 8.5
hours per visit.</P>
      <P>Male students are more inclined to play online games at the
cafes, while female students said that they prefer to visit online
chat rooms.</P>
      <P>In general, the respondents who said that they visit the cafes
mainly to play online games accounted for 33 percent of the total.
Another 29 percent said that they go there to chat online, while
another 23 percent said that they go to the cafes to look for
information online.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 3.9 percent of those polled said that they go to
Internet cafes to look for pornographic Web sites, 2.3 percent said
that they gamble online and 1.7 percent said they go to the cafes to
buy illegal stimulant drugs from dealers.</P>
      <P>The study results show that those students who said they did not
go to Internet cafes either have personal computers at home or are
forbidden by their parents from entering Internet cafes.</P>
      <P>The study was conducted by Hsu Fu-sheng, an assistant professor

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China disputed Monday
Beijing's claims that Taiwan is one of its provinces.</P>
      <P>The ROC Foreign Ministry said in a press release that the ROC and
the People's Republic of China have lived across the Taiwan Strait
from one another for more than five decades. Neither has jurisdiction
over, or represents, the other and each has its own political system,
diplomatic ties and social values, the press release noted.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it went on, Beijing's claims that Taiwan is a province
of the PRC and is thereby not eligible for United Nations membership
is a groundless lie devised to deceive itself and others.</P>
      <P>The ministry said the 1971 U.N. resolution to give the ROC's seat
to the PRC denied the 23 million people of Taiwan the right to be
represented at the international organization and contradicted the
principles of justice, fairness and universal membership for which it
has fought.</P>
      <P>As a responsible member of the international community, the ROC
is entitled to membership of any international group and Beijing's
blockage of the island's bids for membership will only alienate the
island's 23 million people, said the press release.</P>
      <P>The ministry said the PRC should come to terms with the fact that
the ROC on Taiwan is a sovereign country and should promote bilateral
ties accordingly.</P>
      <P>The press release was issued in response to a statement made
Thursday in New York by Beijing's mission to the United Nations.</P>

      <P>In order for a marrow transplant to be successful, the marrow
must be implanted into the patient within 24 hours of extraction from
the donor.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A People First Party (PFP) candidate for
the post of Taipei County magistrate spelled out Monday three
conditions under which he will cooperate with Taiwan's two other main
opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Chin Chin-sheng, who was nominated by the PFP to run for Taipei
County magistrate, said he would response favorably to the
Kuomintang's (KMT's) calls for cooperation in the Taipei County race
if the main opposition promises to support PFP candidate Chung
Shao-he in Kaohsiung County and to support New Party candidate Wang
Chien-shien in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>In anticipation that Wang will win a straw poll among the
candidates of the three parties, Chin said he wanted the KMT leaders
to promise their support for Wang.</P>
      <P>With the two conditions being fulfilled, Chin said, he would
response in kind to the KMT's calls for the three parties to rally
behind one candidate rather than naming their own candidates
separately.</P>
      <P>Chin laid out the conditions during a meeting with Wang during
which he asked Wang to act as a mediator between the KMT and the PFP
with the purpose of promoting cooperation between them in the
year-end elections.</P>
      <P>Wang pointed out after the meeting that the three parties will be
unlikely to win the Taipei County magistrate position if each sticks
to its own candidate.</P>
      <P>He suggested picking a candidate from among the three parties'
choices through polls and expressed his willingness to promote
cooperation between the KMT and the PFP.</P>
      <P>Taipei County is a power-base of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, which has controlled the county hall for 12 years
in a row. There is no sign that its winning streak will be broken in

    <HEADLINE>VP HOPES `CAT CAN PEACEFULLY LIVE WITH LION'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 13 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Annette Lu
said the purpose of a "Voice from Taiwan, World Peace and Love"
campaign initiated by herself is to show how a "terrible lion" --
mainland China -- can live peacefully with a "lovely cat" -- Taiwan.</P>
      <P>She made the remarks while receiving Rep. Ben Gilman, honorary
chairman of the International Relations Committee of the U.S. House
of Representatives, delegates from South Korea and delegates from
Japan who are attending the event.</P>
      <P>She also expressed hope that the international guests will convey
the "voice from Taiwan for world peace" to every corner of the earth.</P>
      <P>Both Beijing's and Taipei's WTO entry is a consensus reached
among the United States and other "important" Western countries, Lu
pointed out, claiming that Beijing "plans to use cross-strait WTO
entry to downgrade Taiwan to the status of that of Hong Kong and
Macau" with a "one country four districts" formula with the aim of
further squeezing Taiwan's space in the international arena.</P>
      <P>"We will absolutely not accept this kind of arrangement and the
people in Taiwan should speak out their rejection to let the people
of the whole world know of our determination," Lu stressed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been isolated and forsaken by international society
and the democratic Taiwan is like a "lovely kitty cat" compared with
mainland China, which is like a "terrible lion," according to Lu. Her
peace forum is supposed to find ways for Taiwan to live peacefully
with the mainland, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Gilman said in return that he firmly supports the ROC's bid for
membership of international organizations including the United
Nations. He also said that the cross-strait dispute should be
resolved peacefully.</P>
      <P>Gilman also quoted former U.S. President Ronald Reagan's
statement before he signed the so-called Aug. 17 joint declaration in
1982. Part of Reagan's statement read: "Arms sales will continue in
accordance with the act and with the full expectation that the
approach of the Chinese government to the resolution of the Taiwan
issue will continue to be peaceful. We attach great significance to
the Chinese statement in the communique regarding China's fundamental
policy, and it is clear from our statements that our future actions
will be conducted with this peaceful policy fully in mind. We have an
abiding interest and concern that any resolution be peaceful. I shall
never waver from this fundamental position."</P>
      <P>Lu's "world peace" activities will kick off Tuesday with more
than 80 international figures converging at the rally.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KOIZUMI'S SHRINE VISIT HURTS ASIAN NEIGHBORS' FEELINGS: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
said Tuesday that Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's visit
to a controversial war shrine has hurt the feelings of people in
neighboring Asian countries.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokeswoman Chang Siao-yue made the remarks at a news
conference after Koizumi on Monday visited the controversial Yasukuni
Shrine, which is dedicated to Japan's war dead, including Class A war
criminals executed by the Allies at the end of World War II.</P>
      <P>Chang said the Republic of China looks forward to seeing the
Japanese government courageously and righteously face up to history
and its past mistakes.</P>
      <P>"We hope that Japan can give priority to forging long-term
rapprochement with its Asian neighbors with vision and
far-sightedness," Chang said, adding that Japan should join forces
with other Asian countries in promoting freedom, democracy and
stability in Asia.</P>
      <P>Chang went on to say that the MOFA has directed the ROC's
representative office in Tokyo to express Taiwan's stance on the
issue.</P>
      <P>Koizumi paid his silent respects at the controversial war shrine
Monday, keeping a vow to visit the shrine but abandoning a promise to
do so on the anniversary of Japan's Aug. 15, 1945 World War II
surrender, which falls on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Koizumi said he had decided to change the date of the visit
because the original plan to go on the surrender anniversary had
generated outrage from Japan's neighbors as well as concern among
members of his own ruling coalition.</P>
      <P>Many Asians see the Yasukuni Shrine as a monument to militarism,
and some Japanese fear official visits to it violate the principle of
separation of religion and state.</P>
      <P>Bowing to such concerns, Koizumi did not undergo traditional
Shinto purification rituals at the altar. He also tried to dispel
criticism that the visit was intended to glorify Japanese militarism.
"Our country should never again walk the path to war," he said in a
statement issued just before the visit.</P>
      <P>Koizumi's shrine visit immediately triggered strident protests
from mainland China and South Korea, which see paying homage at the
shrine as a tribute to Japanese wartime aggression in Asia.</P>
      <P>The MOFA was originally scheduled to issue a press release Monday
afternoon to express its stance, but it delayed the issue of its
reaction until Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang said that as Koizumi's move is a sensitive political issue,
the MOFA must make a prudent and comprehensive evaluation of the
situation before expressing its position.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of National Defense (MND) expressed the
ROC military's indignation Tuesday at Koizumi's visit to the
controversial shrine.</P>
      <P>MND spokesman Huang Suey-sheng said at a routine news conference
that many ROC military servicemen and civilians sacrificed their
lives during the Eight-Year War of Resistance Against Japan
(1937-1945).</P>
      <P>"We would not like to see any Japanese prime minister pay homage
at the shrine, where Japanese war dead, including executed war
criminals, are honored," Huang said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The results of a survey of local
manufacturers released Tuesday shows that nearly two thirds of those
polled will not change their domestic investment plans even when
Taiwan authorities allow direct trade and transportation across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The Statistics Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs
sent questionnaires to 4,000 local manufacturers in March regarding
their investment willingness. Among the 3,055 replies received in
May, 1,904 copies came from small businesses with less than 100
employees, 237 came from medium-size businesses with between 100 and
200 employees, and 914 came from large enterprises.</P>
      <P>The survey revealed that 61.41 percent of the respondents said
that the government's decision on cross-strait direct links will have
no effect on their domestic investment plans in terms of investment
value, 15.35 percent said they will reduce the amount of their
domestic investments, and 23.24 percent said they will boost the
amount of their domestic investments.</P>
      <P>Referring to the impact of Taiwan's entry into the World Trade
Organization, 73.85 percent of those polled said they will not change
their domestic investment plans, 16.56 percent said they will reduce
the amount of their investments, and 9.59 percent said they will
increase them.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy began taking a downturn during the fourth
quarter of last year, and domestic investment willingness has been
low since then. The survey showed that only 25.01 percent of those
polled plan to increase their investments from the levels of the
previous year, while 31.91 percent plan to make less investments this
year.</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu on Tuesday
traveled to Taiwan's offshore island of Kinmen, located just opposite
mainland China, one day before the world peace forum she initiated
formally kicks off Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lu, accompanied by several forum guests, including Nobel laureate

      <P>Lu first went to Kinmen National Park's tourist center to
assemble with other guests who had arrived earlier. The nearly 100
guests then shouted "love and peace" in unison to highlight the theme

      <P>Lu showed concern while viewing the vintage 75 millimeter
artillery guns that were used during past cross-strait fighting,
expressing the hope that war can be "decommissioned" just as these
weapons have been and that peace can take its place.</P>
      <P>Lu and the guests then toured the island's underground tunnels
constructed for military defense to gain a better understanding of

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TOURISM INDUSTRY NEEDS INT'L EXPERIENCE, CAPITAL: MOTC HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  Aug.  13  (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Minister of
Transportation and Communications Yeh Chu-lan said Monday after
visiting Las Vegas that promoting Taiwan tourism will require
international knowledge, capital and experience.</P>
      <P>Yeh, in order to promote Taiwan tourism and solicit overseas
capital for a development project in Tapeng Bay in southern Taiwan
county of Pintung, toured Las Vegas tourism facilities from Aug. 10
and met with Nevada State government officials and tourism operators.</P>
      <P>She said the reason for the success of Las Vegas can be traced to
its long-term experience, its comprehensive planning, its
comprehensive legal system, and its law abiding citizens. She added
that Las Vegas' financial auditing of casinos, facility inspections,
and even its employee background checks have been rigorous.</P>
      <P>Nevada State's tourism head told Yeh that a place cannot draw in
tourists with simply one attraction, pointing out that Las Vegas not
only has casinos, but has also become a convention, shopping and
leisure center.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that Taiwan is blessed with natural beauty as well as
with a multicultural and dynamic society, but added that the island's
tourism industry lacks international experience, capital and
knowledge. She noted that the island's hotel management and leisure
facilities cannot match up with those of the United States.</P>
      <P>She also said that U.S.-based MGM Group has expressed interest in
the development project in Tapeng Bay and that the group will send
officials in late September and early October for an on-site
inspection. Las Vegas tourism officials will also be invited to visit
Taiwan, Yeh added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWO F-16 WINGS TO BE  COMMISSIONED IN EARLY 2002</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two F-16 jet fighter wings will be
commissioned into service in the Republic of China Air Force early
next year, Air Force Commander-in-Chief Chen Chao-min announced
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at a rally at the Air Force General
Headquarters (AFGH) in Taipei to mark the 64th anniversary of the air
force's "Aug. 14 Victory," which refers to the defeat of a Japanese
attack on an ROC air base in Chienchiao, southeastern mainland China,
during World War II.</P>
      <P>Chen said the air force has been undergoing restructuring and
deploying a new generation airborne arsenal in recent years. By now,
the air force has completed commissioning of a squadron of E2-T
airborne warning and control system (AWACS) aircraft, two wings of
Ching-kuo indigenous defense fighters and one wing of French-made
Mirage 2000-5 jet fighters.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said, combat training for two F-16 wings has
entered the final stage. "They are scheduled to formally join air
force services in early 2002," he added.</P>
      <P>The air force has taken delivery of nearly all of the 150
U.S.-made F-16s that make up the two wings, with the exception of a
few of them which are still in the United States, where they are
being used to train ROC pilots. The F-16s are now stationed at the
Chiayi and Hualien air bases.</P>
      <P>In fact, air force sources said, the two F-16 wings can become
ready for combat missions at the end of this year, when 28 sets of
pathfinder\sharpshooter as well as a number of reconnaissance pods to
be installed on the F-16s, will be delivered to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As the current Cabinet is likely to undergo a reshuffle after the
December legislative elections, the sources said, the air force has
decided not to hold a formal commissioning ceremony for the two F-16
wings until after a new Cabinet is formed early next year.</P>
      <P>Addressing the AFGH rally, Chen said the air force's top mission
at the moment is to maintain air supremacy over the Taiwan Strait and
to join forces with other military branches to defeat any invading
enemies.</P>
      <P>Chen encouraged all air force officers and men to glamorize the
air force tradition and create even more glory in the future. "While
marking the Aug. 14 Chienchiao victory anniversary, we must
understand the historic significance of the event and learn from the
self-sacrifice spirit of our air force," he noted.</P>
      <P>Chen further said all air force personnel must dedicate
themselves to defending national security with loyalty and combat
prowess. "To accomplish our mission, we must pay heed to mainland
China's military development, intensify combat skill training and
strengthen risk management and flight safety control," he added.</P>
      <P>At the rally, 201 air force officers were cited for their
outstanding performance in various fields, including flight safety
control, information, combat control, aviation control and logistic
support.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA LOOMING AS NO. 1 RIVAL FOR TAIWAN HI-TECH: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14   (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 50 percent of Taiwan's hi-tech
businesses believe that mainland China will become Taiwan's leading
competitor due to the "go-west" exodus by the local information
industry, according to the results of a recent poll.</P>
      <P>At the same time, nearly 90 percent of Taiwan's hi-tech firms are
worried that Taiwan-based foreign companies will move their
production lines out of Taiwan in the coming three years, the survey
made public by Business Weekly in early August shows.</P>
      <P>The poll of companies whose business revenues exceeded NT$500
million in 2000 shows that 70 percent praised the government's role
in the development of Taiwan's information industry over the past 20
years, but only 8.9 percent think Taiwan's economy will remain "in
good shape" in the coming three years, lagging 43.6 percent who said
it will be "regular" and 47.5 percent that are "pessimistic" about
the issue.</P>
      <P>Of those who hold a "pessimistic view" of Taiwan's economy, 35
percent attributed "political woes" to the deteriorating economy,
while 14 percent and 11 percent blamed "industry exodus" and
"government policies," respectively, for the situation.</P>
      <P>Some 50.2 percent said that those local computer firms that have
set up plants in mainland China will pose the largest threat to those
maintaining their operations at home in the coming three years. A
dwindling economy, Taiwan's falling status as a manufacturing center
and a talent exodus are also problems troubling them, the survey
points out.</P>
      <P>As to the question of the future of Taiwan's computer industry,
around 30 percent of the personal computer-related businesses
surveyed said it is "extremely good" or "good," fewer than 48.7
percent that said it will be "business as usual" and ahead of 20
percent that were "extremely pessimistic" or "pessimistic" about the
issue.</P>
      <P>In related news, a local official has warned that Taiwan
industries should seek profound transformation or they will be caught
up soon by their mainland Chinese competitors.</P>
      <P>Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) Director-General Shih
Yen-shiang said recently that Taiwan businesses must shift to high
value-added manufacturing and focus on R&amp;D, design, marketing and
creating own-brand names. He predicted that local industries will be
outperformed by their mainland Chinese counterparts within five years
should they fail to do so.</P>
      <P>According to the IDB head, Taiwan industries are facing a
historic challenge in that they must ride out the painful
transformation period in order to survive at a time when
globalization is sweeping the world and the mainland is quickly
emerging as a strong rival.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that those businesses that fail to achieve this
objective will be eventually phased out, no matter whether they
choose to relocate to mainland China or maintain their operations in
Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC VICE PRESIDENT VISITS KINMEN WITH INTERNATIONAL PEACE ADVOCATES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Aug.  14  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A 90-member delegation of international
peace advocates led by Republic of China Vice President Annette Lu
and including Nobel Peace Prize winner Oscar Arias Sanchez visited
the frontline ROC island of Kinmen Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by local government officials, the group of peace
advocates, including heads of international NGOs and legislators from
Holland, Japan, South Korea, Thailand and the Philippines, toured
local historic military sites such as the underground combat
readiness tunnels and the cavernous Atlas Dome, which was entirely
carved out of granite by 1,000 soldiers in 1963 and can serve as an
emergency medical center in times of conflict.</P>
      <P>Lu said at a lunch banquet welcoming her and the foreign guests
that her present visit -- her third to Kinmen since she became vice
president last May -- is the most significant so far because of the
peace advocates accompanying her to the heavily garrisoned island
known for its strategic position in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>She added her hope that her guests can exchange views on how to
bring peace to the Taiwan Strait after they return to Taiwan-proper
to continue their series of activities for the 2001 Global Peace
Assembly being held in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Thanking all the soldiers and local military commanders for
protecting the nation, she said that peace for many people is just a
slogan, but for the servicemen and women in Kinmen, it is a matter of
life and death and a sacred mission.</P>
      <P>Noting that she is confident that the "bell of peace" will in the
near future be heard around the world, including Kinmen, she said
that she hopes Kinmen will -- under the leadership of the government
and with the contribution of the people of Kinmen -- become a "bridge
of peace" between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Arias, president of Costa Rica from 1986-1990 and who received
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987, said at the banquet that "peace is
necessary," and that in a civilized world, no one should resort to
the use of military force to solve conflicts.</P>
      <P>He said that in a rational world, conflicts should be resolved at
the negotiating table, adding that the same is true for the situation
in the Taiwan Strait, so that the new generation in Taiwan can live
in a "new century of peace."</P>
      <P>"Dialogue produces miracles," Arias said, explaining that "you
need to look in the face and the eyes of the other party and for
that, you need to sit around a negotiating table. And if the other
party doesn't want to take part in dialogue, be humble, invite it to
dialogue, and if it refuses, invite it again."</P>
      <P>The essence of dialogue is compromise, he added.</P>
      <P>He called for a closer look at the real dangers to world peace --
poverty, illiteracy and environmental degradation -- instead of
starting a new arms race.</P>
      <P>"How can we live in peace in the future if half of the world
population lives in poverty, if people don't have access to potable
water, if most of the people in the world are illiterate?" he asked.</P>
      <P>A two-day "World Peace Forum" is scheduled to kick off Wednesday,
with the theme of "Creating Eternal Peace in the Taiwan Strait."
Former ROC President Lee Teng-hui is slated to speak at the forum's
opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>An outdoor concert titled "A Night of World Peace" will be held
Wednesday evening at Taipei's Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, where Lu
and the Nobel laureates who were invited to participate in the series
of events will jointly inaugurate a "Terrestrial Globe of Peace" in
commemoration of the end of World War II some 56 years ago.</P>
      <P>The Nobel Peace Prize winners invited to attend the event include
Arias; former Polish President Lech Walesa; former South African
President Frederick W. de Klerk; Jody Williams, a U.S. anti-land mine
activist; and Joseph Rotblat, a British nuclear scientist who
advocates the elimination of nuclear arms around the world.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COUPLE INVOLVED IN TAIPEI BUS HIJACKING INDICTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei Prosecutor's Office indicted
Tuesday a married couple accused of hijacking a tour bus in Taipei in
June.</P>
      <P>The couple -- Chang Wen-liang and his wife Chuang Pao-yun -- were
charged with committing an offense against public safety.</P>
      <P>The couple used a remodeled handgun in Taipei June 23 to hold the
driver of a tour bus and 13 passengers hostage, demanding to meet
Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan to present a petition of grievance.</P>
      <P>A standoff between Taipei police and the hijackers lasted for
about four hours and did not come to an end until after Chen
acquiesced to the hijackers' demands by appearing in the dense crowd
of rubberneckers that had gathered at the scene, totally overwhelming
the police, who failed completely to maintain order at the scene.</P>
      <P>Prosecution authorities said in the indictment that the couple's
resorting to bus hijacking to highlight their appeal had caused
public unrest and a waste of public resources.</P>
      <P>Therefore, they asked the Taipei District Court to sentence the
couple to seven years in prison.</P>
      <P>The hijacking incident began at around 2 p.m. June 23, when the
hijackers forced a tour bus on which they were traveling to come to a
stop on at a busy city intersection and then demanded to meet with
Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen rushed to a nearby police precinct but remained behind the
scenes to allow the police to continue attempting to engage the
hijackers in communication.</P>
      <P>For nearly four hours, police were unable to determine how many
hostages were aboard the bus because all the curtains were drawn and
the hijackers refused a cellular phone offered to them.</P>
      <P>All communication had to be carried out via handwritten signs
that were held up to the bus windows and the hijackers did not reveal
themselves, relying instead on a female hostage to read the notes
held up by the police.</P>
      <P>The standoff ended after Taipei SWAT teams stormed the bus and
rescued the hostages on board. No one was injured in the incident.</P>
      <P>The woman hijacker stepped off the bus first and rushed toward
Chen to deliver a petition of grievance. Seconds after the woman left
the bus, SWAT teams detonated two flashbangs outside the bus "to
disorient" the remaining hijacker still aboard the bus and shattered
a window to attract his attention. Fortunately, other policemen then
swarmed in from the other side and took control of the situation.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Prosecutor's Office said other prosecution authorities
are still handling the hijacking couple's petition of grievance
concerning a land deal and an injury charge involving their son.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLA `NO WORK, NO PAY' PROPOSAL LAMBASTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A "no work, no pay" formula proposed
Tuesday by the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) to scrap monthly
salaries for domestic workers in favor of hourly or daily rates, was
immediately met with a backlash and opposition.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, however, a presidential policy consultative meeting
reached consensus Tuesday that the nation's minimum wage requirement
will not be scrapped.</P>
      <P>CLA Chairwoman Chen Chu claimed that the proposed "no work, no
pay" formula that would see workers paid by hour in order to fully
reflect production costs, is "in line with the global trend" and
would not be seen as taking away human rights protection for
blue-collar workers.</P>
      <P>Dismissing Chen's statement, Legislator Chien Hsi-chieh of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Chen was
"irresponsible" for saying that the "no work, no pay" formula is a
global trend. He pointed out that on the contrary, many industrially
advanced countries are now reviewing the formula to assess its impact
on real industrial development and progress.</P>
      <P>Chien said the "no work, no pay" formula will only result in
reducing pay and rights for blue-collar workers and would contribute
nothing to raising the nation's international competitiveness.</P>
      <P>As the highest-level government agency responsible for protecting
laborers' rights, the CLA has downgraded itself into nothing more
than a tool of the capital-holding management side by proposing such
an unjust formula, Chien added.</P>
      <P>Lin Feng-hsi, DPP party whip at the Legislative Yuan, said the
DPP legislative caucus will not throw its support behind the "no
work, no pay" proposal, which he described as lacking justice to the
blue-collar workers.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's sagging economy is not going to be saved
simply by sacrificing the interests of local workers, Lin said any
changes in the patterns of payment must be made through negotiations
and agreements between business and enterprise owners and the
laborers.</P>
      <P>The "no work, no pay" proposal also faced an immediate backlash
from Taiwan's labor union groups.</P>
      <P>Demonstrating in downtown Taipei, members of the labor groups
said their incomes would be cut by one-third if they were to be paid
by the hour.</P>
      <P>Under the new "no work, no pay" formula, enterprise owners and
operators would be able to withhold pay for the 52 days in a year
that are currently paid holidays under the existing Labor Standards
Law.</P>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang slammed the formula as "immoral." Lee
Cheng-tsung, KMT party whip at the Legislative Yuan, said the KMT
would never allow the proposal to clear the legislative floor.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, the nine-member presidential policy consultative
meeting also decided that the minimum wage requirement, which
currently guarantees domestic workers a minimum of NT$15,840 (US$458)
a month, will not be scrapped in order to protect the workers' basic
rights and interests.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT RATING TO RISE TO 18TH PLACE: EIU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14  (CNA)
(By Mark Ou and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's general business and industry
environment will improve in the next five years, rising to the
world's 18th-best from the current 21st place, according to the
latest evaluation by a British economic research firm.</P>
      <P>The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), an affiliate of the
London-based Economist weekly, had studied the general commerce and
industry climate of 60 major economies around the world and released
a report on its findings this week.</P>
      <P>In the previous EIU review, Taiwan's business climate for the
1996-2000 period received a score of 7.37 points, ranking 21st among
all the economies scrutinized.</P>
      <P>In its latest report, the EIU predicted that Taiwan's business
climate will improve during the 2001-2005 period to receive a score
of 8.06 points and 18th place in its global ranking.</P>
      <P>Under the EIU scaling system, a score above eight points receives
a "very good" rating and a score of 6.5 points to eight points is
given a rating of "good."</P>
      <P>The EIU report said Taiwan is expected to make progress and
improvements in overall economic environment, policy on foreign
investment, privatization, foreign trade and foreign exchange
controls, bank financing, labor market and infrastructure
construction over the next five years.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the report said Taiwan's political stability, tax
burden and market opportunities may deteriorate mildly during the
same period.</P>
      <P>The Netherlands will continue to boast the world's best business
environment in the next five years, followed by the United States,
Britain, Canada, Switzerland, Ireland, Finland, Singapore, Sweden and
Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Most noteworthy is the fact that Hong Kong's rating declined from
third to 10th place. The EIU report attributed the sharp fall partly
to the territory's political changes, control policy and a widening
gap between its labor demand and supply. Hong Kong, a former British
colony, reverted to Beijing's rule July 1, 1997.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, Chang Yao-chung, director of the
Statistics Department under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, said
Taiwan's economic future lies in the development of its service
industry, including developing Taiwan into an Asia-Pacific business
operation hub as well as a trading and banking center.</P>
      <P>Chang said recent government moves to overhaul and streamline the
banking sector, to ease various investment restrictions and to pave
the way for opening direct trade across the Taiwan Strait are all
aimed at creating a better investment climate and improving the
island's overall economic structure.</P>
      <P>Noting that the series of measures will help revive investor
confidence, Chang said Taiwan's economic situation will certainly
take an upturn next year.</P>
      <P>Chen Po-chih, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development, echoed Chang's view, saying that Taiwan's
investment climate will improve after the Aug. 24-26 Economic
Development Advisory Conference comes up with a package of measures
to address some of the existing problems and outline future
development directions.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 14 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The new Taiwan dollar rose NT$0.017 against
the U.S. dollar Tuesday on the Taipei foreign exchange market,
finishing at 34.582.</P>
      <P>The local unit opened at 34.572 and was traded between a low of
34.546 and the day's high, which was its closing level.</P>
      <P>Interbank transactions in U.S. dollars totaled US$640 million.</P>
      <P>Market dealers attributed the local currency's appreciation to a
stronger yen, which boosted all Asian currencies. But they pointed
out that the Central Bank of China might have interfered in late
trading out of concern that the local unit may appreciate too quickly
against the greenback.</P>
      <P>Market dealers forecast that the new Taiwan dollar might hover in
the range between 34.55 and 34.57 over the next few days.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWO CREWMEN OF GREEK VESSEL ALLOWED TO LEAVE TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two crewmen of a Greek vessel which ran
aground off the costs of southern Taiwan's Pingtung County and
polluted nearby waters in January were allowed by the government to
leave Taiwan, an Environmental Protection Administration (EPA)
official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The decision to allow the men to leave was made during an
inter-ministerial Cabinet meeting a day earlier. EPA head Hau
Long-ping said Tuesday that the EPA was asked to allow the men to
leave while continuing to seek compensation from the owners and
insurers of the Greek ship the Amargos with the help of law firms at
home and abroad.</P>
      <P>Hau said it was "unnecessary" to continue detaining the pair in
Taiwan, as the owners and insurers had actually come to Taiwan but
left without having negotiated with the Taiwan authorities.</P>
      <P>"Since they care not a bit for the two crew members, it is
meaningless to continue detaining them in Taiwan and the government
decided to let them depart out of consideration of human rights,
legal and diplomatic factors," Hau said.</P>
      <P>Hau added that he has consulted with both local and foreign law
specialists regarding the case and that he has been told that the EPA
still stands a good chance of winning the lawsuit for compensation
for the cleanup operation. Hau said that he has full confidence in
getting the money.</P>
      <P>According to the EPA head, the two Greek seamen were made to sign
a pledge promising to cooperate with the ROC judicial authorities
investigating the case and to accept the final verdict.</P>
      <P>If the pair break their promise, the EPA will undoubtedly file an
international lawsuit in order to display Taiwan's determination to
protect its ecosystems.</P>
      <P>The Amargos ran aground and broke in two off the coast of Kenting
National Park Jan. 14 and seriously polluted a large area of nearby
waters when its fuel tanks ruptured.</P>
      <P>Because of the EPA's ineptitude, it failed to take timely action
to limit the damage, and its mishandling of the situation later led
to former EPA head Lin Chun-yi resigning to take responsibility.</P>
      <P>The EPA estimated that it has spent NT$90 million in cleaning up
the contamination, while damage incurred to the local fishing
industry and ecosystem has yet to be calculated. Future compensation
must take into account these two points, EPA officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN BACKS CALL TO EASE 'GO SLOW' POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian voiced explicit
support Tuesday for the proposals to ease restrictions on mainland
China-bound investment.</P>
      <P>"I believe that it's wise choice to replace the existing 'go
slow, be patient' mainland investment policy with an open, active
and effective management approach," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks during a community reach-out tour
of the southern Taiwan county of Kaohsiung where he visited
several Buddhist and Taoist temples and a large semiconductor
company.</P>
      <P>This was the first time that Chen has expressed his views on the
issue since the cross-strait affairs panel under the
soon-to-be-convened Economic Development Advisory Conference (EDAC)
reached a consensus urging the government to adjust the "go slow"
policy on mainland China-bound investment.</P>
      <P>The proposal has drawn mixed reaction in local society. Vice
President Annette Lu, for instance, has expressed worries about the
possible adverse impact on Taiwan's economic well-being of further
relaxation of mainland China-bound investment.</P>
      <P>President Chen said he himself thinks that adjusting the "go
slow" investment policy is "the right path we must follow."</P>
      <P>"Only when we have confidence can we not be afraid of
competition. Like riding a bicycle, we can't limit ourselves to
riding in a room. Only when we go outside can we find more
opportunities," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president further said he is convinced that so long as
Taiwan can adhere to the principles of "Taiwan first, global
planning, risk management and reciprocity," it would have a secure
environment for sustainable national development.</P>
      <P>In this era of globalization, Chen went on, development of
trade and economic relations between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait is a prevailing trend. "We can't resist this trend in
order to maintain our competitiveness in the global market," he
noted.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen said, the government must still exercise
prudence in handling relevant affairs because they involve
Taiwan's long-term political and economic interests.</P>
      <P>Noting that all EDAC members are now endeavoring to forge
national consensus on certain critical issues, Chen said he believes
that the Aug. 24-26 EDAC plenary meeting would be able to outline
clear policy direction and guidelines.</P>
      <P>Chen said his administration would also do its best to respond
to the demands of various social quarters and continue to improve
the domestic investment climate and develop Taiwan into a "green
silicon island."</P>

(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lin Feng-hsi, legislative caucus leader of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, said Tuesday that he met
with just-released former Bamboo Union gang leader Chen Chi-li in
Phnom Pehn Aug. 12 to try to persuade him to return to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen, who is wanted on criminal charges in Taiwan, was freed
together with two associates Aug. 10 after a Cambodian court
sentenced them to short suspended jail terms for illegal arms
possession. They had been detained since summer last year.</P>
      <P>Lin said at a press conference that he went to Cambodia to
persuade Chen to come back to Taiwan for trial because he feared that
Chen might go to mainland China through the arrangement of Chen's
friend "White Wolf" Chang An-lo.</P>
      <P>He said that he met with Chen at the home of a "common friend" in
Phnom Penh and talked from noon till midnight.</P>
      <P>Chen was quoted as saying that he "will certainly come back to
Taiwan" when his health, hurt by a recent stroke in prison, becomes
more stable and after his financial matters are handled.</P>
      <P>However, when asked when Chen will return to Taiwan, Lin replied
that "the time is not ripe yet."</P>
      <P>Chen reportedly expressed his hope that the Republic of China
Ministry of Foreign Affairs will issue him documents allowing him to
enter Taiwan, and added that he is willing to be investigated in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen is wanted on criminal charges in Taiwan stemming from a
crackdown against organized crime in September 1997.</P>
      <P>He told Lin that he left Taiwan for mainland China "for medical
treatment" before his name went on the wanted list and added that he
later proceeded to Cambodia because he feared the information
collected by related Taiwan authorities against him was "unfair."</P>
      <P>Lin told reporters that Taiwan security authorities were aware of
his travel plans before he left for Cambodia.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) decided
Tuesday to expel 11 party members who quit the party to run on the
ticket of the just-established Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) party in
the year-end legislative elections.</P>
      <P>The KMT Evaluation and Discipline Committee, meanwhile, decided
to shelve a proposal that former KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui be
reprimanded for his presence at the inauguration of the TSU -- a
party formed mainly by Lee's followers and supporters.</P>
      <P>Huang Chin-teh, deputy speaker of the Taoyuan County Council, who
was originally on a blacklist of 12 party members who will be dealt
with for their defection to the TSU, was not expelled, as his case
remained "arguable and debatable," said Chen Keng-chin,
director-general of the KMT Evaluation and Discipline Committee.</P>
      <P>Huang was later discovered to have decided to run in the December
legislative elections representing the "Huang clan" in the northern
county of Taoyuan, rather than on the TSU ticket, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>As for the Lee issue, Chen said that the party's Evaluation and
Discipline Committee will implement any measure that is conducive to
the party's existence and development but will give second thoughts
to proposals that could impair the party's interests, such as
reprimanding Lee.</P>
      <P>Chen said the committee members decided that it is improper at
present for the party to move to have Lee punished. Asked when
exactly the KMT will deal with Lee, Chen said "it depends on how
things go."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government announced Tuesday that 17
people in three families who lost their loved ones in the Pachang
Creek tragedy of July 22, 2000, had been repaid a total of NT$23.64
million (US$683,632) for their losses.</P>
      <P>The payment, made Aug. 2, was in accordance with the National
Compensation Law after the government reached an agreement with
members of the three families recently, said officials from the
National Fire Administration under the Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>On July 22, 2000, people in Taiwan watched in horror and anxiety
as live television cameras beamed images of four hapless riverbed
clean-up workers huddled together in the raging Pachang Creek in the
southern county of Chiayi in the midst of a flash flood.</P>
      <P>The victims waited for over two hours as local officials bickered
over who should dispatch rescue helicopters. By the time the
helicopters finally arrived, they were too late, as all four had been
swept to their deaths in the surging current.</P>
      <P>The deaths triggered public uproar and shaved about 20 percentage

      <P>Former Costa Rican President Oscar Arias
Sanchez, a 1987 Nobel Peace Prize winner, said in Kinmen Tuesday that
Taiwan and mainland China should engage in dialogue to ease the
tension across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Arias, who was invited to attend the Aug. 15 "World Peace Forum"
in Taipei, visited the offshore island with Republic of China Vice
President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a lunch gathering, the Nobel laureate said that "at
the start of the new century, we must discard Marxism and Leninism"
and "replace war with love and peace" so as to create an everlasting
peace for humankind.</P>
      <P>Touching on the development of cross-strait relations, Arias
noted that "more dialogues are required to ease the tension across
the strait," and added that "the conflict should be resolved through
dialogue and compromise and with a rational approach and mutual
understanding."</P>
      <P>He said that "a miracle" will emerge from bilateral dialogues and
went on to say "if one side is not willing to sit down for talks, the
other side should make the request again and again, with a humble and
harmonious attitude."</P>
      <P>Arias said that there are many ways to build world peace in the
21st century, but attention must be given to the genuine crises that
pose a threat to the peace of the world, such as poverty, illiteracy
and the worsening of the environment.</P>
      <P>"If more than half of the world's population live in poverty, how
can we survive in peace?" he asked.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MINIMUM WAGE FOR LABORERS SHOULD NOT BE SCRAPPED: EDAC PANEL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Members of the Economic Development
Advisory Conference (EDAC) agreed at a panel discussion Tuesday that
the minimum wage protection for the nation's laborers should not be
scrapped.</P>
      <P>The panel also agreed that in accordance with the principle of
fairness and in light of Taiwan's imminent entry into the World Trade
Organization, foreign workers should also be subject to the same
minimum wage protection as their local counterparts.</P>
      <P>There have been mounting calls, especially from the enterprises
which employ large numbers of foreign workers, that the foreign
employees' pay be de-linked from the nation's minimum wage protection
of NT$15,840 monthly as stipulated by the Labor Standard law, so as
to lower their production costs and sharpen their competitive edge.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which employs over 300,000 foreign workers, is reported
to be one of the places where foreign workers enjoy the highest
degree of wage protection.</P>
      <P>The panel, however, suggested a change in the foreign workers'
wage system by deducting their board and meal costs but lowering the
brokerage fees charged to the workers.</P>
      <P>The meeting suggested that the existing 84-hour bi-weekly work
hour system should not be dropped in favor of the 44-hour weekly
work-hour system and that female worker's night-time work hours
should be subject to the same conditions as their male counterparts.</P>
      <P>The panel demanded that a "movable" pension system for the
workers should be adopted and that workers should be allowed to
decide whether to claim their pensions year by year or in a lump sum
upon retirement.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, another EDAC panel shelved a proposal by Minister of
Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi that the commodities tax be either
dismantled of halved for certain products.</P>
      <P>Scrapping the commodities tax, which Lin claimed is "outdated,"
would cost the national coffers hundreds of billions of new Taiwan
dollars and would force the government to increase the business tax
to make up the shortfall, said Lei Chien, a panel member.</P>
      <P>Conclusions of the panel discussion will be forwarded to the
EDAC, which will meet later this month, for further deliberation.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung on Wednesday
reiterated the government's determination in setting faltering
local-level financial institutions right.</P>
      <P>Rectifying and reorganizing local-level financial institutions is
one of the most critical and important parts of the financial reforms
program that the government has pushed to accomplish, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>Personnel from an ad hoc task force organized by the Monetary
Reconstruction Fund under the Executive Yuan have been assigned to 36
faltering financial institutions islandwide since Monday, formally
putting those banks, mostly farmer's and fishermen's cooperatives,
under government supervision.</P>
      <P>Chang called for relevant officials from the Ministry of Finance,
the Council of Agriculture and the Central Bank of China -- the
executive agencies in charge of the reforms -- to be careful and
fair, but also determined when carrying out the task of straightening
out the local-level financial institutions.</P>
      <P>The task is designed to root out illegal credit loans,
embezzlement, the siphoning off of public funds, the exchanging of
vested interests, and other irregularities that have been depleting
the country's financial strength, he added.</P>
      <P>Those sent to supervise the faltering financial institutions,
temporarily transferred from the Bank of Taiwan, the Land Bank of
Taiwan, the Taiwan Cooperative Bank and the Farmer's Bank of China,
will check on their assigned institution's cash deposit status as
well as its credit accounts.</P>
      <P>The institutions with negative net assets include 27 credit
departments of farmer's associations, two credit departments of
fishermen's associations and seven credit cooperatives, mostly in
rural or coastal areas of central and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The task force will supervise the operations of these badly
performing banks over the next three months and help them find merger
possibilities, according to officials from the Monetary
Reconstruction Fund.</P>
      <P>Immediately after the stationing of the task force personnel, 14
farmer's and fishermen's cooperatives agreed to hand over the
management of their credit departments. These departments are likely
to be merged with public banks in the future, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The Monetary Reconstruction Fund was set up in July of this year
to help redress the financial problems of Taiwan's financial
institutions. The task force will evaluate the status of the problem
institutions and whether the fund can entrust the Central Deposit
Insurance Corp. with the task of managing the debts and assets of
these organizations, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang said task force
personnel will be dispatched to any of the 326 other financial
institutions islandwide which are currently operating normally if any
irregularities are reported at any one of them in the future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLL FINDS KMT MOST LIKELY TO BE HURT BY ESTABLISHMENT OF TSU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The establishment of the Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) is most likely to hurt the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) in the year-end legislative elections, according to the results
of an opinion poll released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 1,074 adult residents randomly selected
from around the island, conducted by the local magazine "Open" from
Aug. 10-11, found that 33.1 percent of those interviewed said they
think that the TSU's inauguration will be most harmful to the KMT.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 14 percent of the respondents said they believe that
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will suffer the most as
a result of the establishment of the TSU, and 4.9 percent said the
People First Party (PFP) will be hurt the most, while 4.1 percent
said they think that all the major domestic political parties will be
affected by the TSU's birth.</P>
      <P>In contrast, 3.6 percent said they don't think that the TSU's
arrival will hurt any of local political parties.</P>
      <P>The survey results also showed that 26.4 percent support the
proposal that the KMT and its two splinter groups -- the People First
Party (PFP) and the New Party (NP) -- cooperate in the year-end
legislative elections. The three parties are generally believed to
share common views or stance on the development of relations
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In comparison, only 16.2 percent threw their support behind the
proposal that the DPP and the TSU, which was formally inaugurated
Aug. 12 with the blessing of former President Lee Teng-hui, cooperate
in the year-end elections. Both the DPP and the TSU have placed more
emphasis on Taiwan's separate identity and well-being.</P>
      <P>But 19.3 percent said they would not like to see any inter-party
cooperation.</P>
      <P>Asked which domestic politician is most capable of cultivating a
personal following, 22.3 percent said PFP Chairman James Soong, 12
percent mentioned President Chen Shui-bian and 6.5 percent cited KMT
Chairman Lien Chan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THEATER DEFENSE COULD LEAD CHINA TO SOVIET-STYLE COLLAPSE: EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  14  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A renowned U.S. China expert has
pointed out that if the United States goes ahead with plans to build
a theater missile defense system, it may push mainland China into a
systemic crisis that could lead to the collapse of the Communist
regime.</P>
      <P>Steven Mosher, president of the Population Research Institute,
said in an article in a recent issue of the Bulletin Atomic
Scientists monthly that just as Ronald Reagan's strategic defense
initiative pushed Soviet leaders into desperate measures that
ultimately led to the collapse of the Soviet Union, U.S. President
George W. Bush may push Communist China toward a similar fate by
constructing a theater missile defense.</P>
      <P>President Bush's theater missile defense would "do more than just
protect the free world from attacks by rogue nations like Iraq, Libya
and China. This new defensive system, to be developed with Germany,
Italy, Japan and Israel, would put tremendous pressure on Red China
to evolve into a free market democracy or die," said the author of
"Hegemony: China's Plan to Dominate Asia and the World"</P>
      <P>In the article, Mosher was quoted as saying that building a
theater missile defense "would eventually break the back of
Beijing's military budget" and might help Communist China "go the
way of the former Soviet Union."</P>
      <P>He noted that "China's main strategic objective is to stealthily
build up a conventional and nuclear weapons force that is able to
intimidate Taiwan and defeat U.S. forces in Asia, while avoiding an
all-out arms race with the United States."</P>
      <P>"By upping the ante with missile defense, Bush is forcing the
Chinese Politburo into a stark choice -- go head-to-head with the
United States and run the risk of systemic collapse, or defer
military competition for a generation in favor of peacefully building
up China's infrastructure."</P>
      <P>The expert on U.S.-mainland Chinese relations and military
affairs said he is convinced that the "odds are that Beijing will
choose plowshares over swords. In buying time for ourselves, we buy
time for China's democracy movement."</P>
      <P>"The Bush administration must be praised for its firm commitment
to missile defense today. Twenty years from now, when Chinese
hegemony has ceased being a threat to Asia, Americans will liken this
peaceful initiative to Reagan's Cold War victory over the former
Soviet Union," Mosher concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUTHORITIES AND ADVISORS IN AGREEMENT ON WORKERS' PENSION REFORM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  15  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) announced Wednesday that it agrees with a
resolution Tuesday by the Economic Development Advisory Conference
(EDAC) regarding a reform to the workers' pension program.</P>
      <P>The EDAC's labor affairs panel Tuesday reached a resolution
regarding retirement payments to workers in the private sector.
Members of the panel suggested that a worker should have a personal
pension account transferable in case of change of employment and that
an employer must pay 6 percent of the employee's total monthly wage
aggregate into the worker's retirement account.</P>
      <P>In consideration of the financial burden on employers, the
advisors suggested that the allocations contributed by the employers
can begin at 2 percent of the employee's monthly wage and gradually
increase to 6 percent.</P>
      <P>According to the Labor Standards Law and the existing practices
of the Rules for the Allocation and Management of Workers' Retirement
Fund, retirees are entitled to a maximum pension equal to 45 times
their average wage in the six months prior to their retirement.</P>
      <P>The advisors suggested that retirees be given the choice of
taking the whole sum of their personal pension account on the day of
their retirement, or receiving regular pension payments.</P>
      <P>A CEPD official said that the personal pension account system and
a fixed rate of allocations have clearly defined the rights of
employees and the obligations of employers.</P>
      <P>He said that a solid pension program for employees in the private
sector can relieve the burden on younger generations and save social
welfare costs.</P>
      <P>Chen Chu, chairman of the Council of Labor Affairs, also
advocated the establishment of transferable personal pension accounts
for employees in view of the fact that 90 percent of workers in the
private sector retire or are laid off without payments. The proposed
system can guarantee the rights and benefits of employees in the
private sector, she added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN URGES BEIJING TO PUT ASIDE CONFLICT AND WORK FOR PEACE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  15  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged mainland
Chinese leaders Wednesday to put aside conflict and faithfully work
for permanent peace in the Taiwan Strait as well as for Asia-Pacific
and global peace.</P>
      <P>Chen made the call while meeting with five Nobel Peace Prize
winners who have converged in Taipei to take part in a "Voice from
Taiwan: Peace and Love" campaign, also known as the 2001 Global
Peace Assembly, organized by Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>Chen first extended his hearty welcome to the five Nobel
laureates, saying their visit is a great encouragement to the
Republic of China's efforts to pursue democracy and maintain peace.</P>
      <P>Despite mainland China's perennial military threat, Chen said,
Taiwan managed to complete its historic transition of power between
different political parties in the last year of the 20th century.</P>
      <P>"The 23 million people of Taiwan used love, hope and confidence
to overcome hostility, threat and fear. They also used their sacred
ballots to prove to the world their firm belief in such universal
values as freedom, democracy and peace," Chen explained.</P>
      <P>Noting that peace is a human being's highest rational pursuit,
Chen said he deeply appreciates the arrival of the five Nobel Peace
Prize winners to witness Taiwan's achievements in pursuing democracy
and promoting peace.</P>
      <P>Chen quoted a Buddhist scripture passage -- "Anyone who lays down
the butcher knife to repent can become like Buddha" -- to urge
leaders in Beijing to put aside any notions of conflict and to work
for peace.</P>
      <P>As the ROC's head of state, Chen said he must follow the common
will and determination of the 23 million people of Taiwan to pursue
permanent peace.</P>
      <P>"I earnestly hope that the top leaders on the other side of the
Taiwan Strait can fully understand the true meaning of `putting aside
conflict to create peace' so that the people on both sides can join
forces to contribute to regional and world peace," Chen stressed.</P>
      <P>Vice President Lu, who accompanied the five Nobel laureates to
meet President Chen, said she is convinced that the five guests will
help send messages of peace between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait after their current visit. "They can serve as envoys for
cross-strait peace," she added.</P>
      <P>For his part, former South African President Fredrik W. de Klerk,
a co-winner of the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize, said that at present,
conflicts rage in several places in Asia, including Sri Lanka, India
and Pakistan.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, de Klerk said defusing cross-strait
tensions is critical to maintaining Asia-Pacific regional peace and
stability.</P>
      <P>De Klerk said if mainland China regards Taiwan as an enemy, it
should sit down and talk with Taiwan to resolve bilateral disputes.</P>
      <P>No matter how cross-strait relations develop, de Klerk said he
does not want to see the ROC become more like the People's Republic
of China.</P>
      <P>"I hope to see the PRC become more like the ROC, and I believe
that this is a common expectation of the entire free world," de Klerk
added.</P>
      <P>Former Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez, the 1987 Nobel
Peace Prize winner, said that cross-strait disputes should be
resolved through peaceful means and that resorting to the use of
force should be condemned.</P>
      <P>The three other Nobel laureates -- former Polish President Lech
Walesa, anti-landmine activist Jody Williams, and Joseph Rotblat, an
anti-nuclear expert -- also expressed their hope that the stalled
cross-strait dialogue can be resumed quickly and that all
cross-strait issues can be resolved peacefully.</P>
      <P>The two-day "Peace and Love" campaign will close Thursday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ONE-SIXTH OF TAIWAN LISTED COMPANIES PLAN TO LAY OFF WORKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 15 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The global economic recession has brought a
chilly winter to employees of Taiwan businesses, with even those
working for companies listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TSE)
worrying about their job security.</P>
      <P>The results of a survey conducted by the Chinese-language
Business Weekly among TSE listed companies scheduled to be released
on Thursday indicates that one sixth of those companies polled will
lay off personnel as part of their belt-tightening measures.</P>
      <P>The business magazine recently sent questionnaires to 794 listed
companies and received 354 replies. Among the respondents, 72.9
percent said they have adopted such cost-saving measures to counter
the effects of Taiwan's sluggish economy.</P>
      <P>While reducing personnel expenses is an important cost-saving
measure that has been adopted by many companies, 32.7 percent of the
respondents said they have frozen the number of employees on the
payroll, 16.6 percent have laid off personnel, and 11.5 percent have
applied early retirement measures.</P>
      <P>The survey report also showed that the most probable targets of
company layoff programs are those aged over 50, those who have worked
with a company for more than 20 years, and those who hold
middle-level positions.</P>
      <P>Employees with professional skills, a good working attitude,
foreign language abilities, and a spirit of teamwork are more secure
from losing their jobs, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Nearly 60 percent of the respondents said that they have no plans
to hire additional personnel even when Taiwan's economic prospects
make a turn for the better. For new recruitment plans, priorities
will be given to sales personnel and technical workers.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted in early August. In addition to
questionnaires, the magazine also conducted telephone interviews with
executives of the surveyed companies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRUST ABSENT IN CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONSHIP: ADVISOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the fact that Taiwan and mainland
China have both benefited from their economic and trade exchanges
over the past several years, mutual trust has been absent in their
relationship, a presidential adviser said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Hsin-huang, a presidential adviser and a fellow researcher
at Academia Sinica, said that while the economies of Taiwan and
mainland China have become increasingly integrated, contradictions
between the two sides persist in the political and military arenas.</P>
      <P>This discordance was actually present in the relationship between
East and West Germany before German unification, and it can been seen
in the present relationship between North and South Korea, Hsiao
pointed out.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan and mainland China share a common ancestry as
well as the same culture and language, the two sides are far apart
socially, politically and economically, he said, adding that Taiwan
strove for more than two decades to attain its economic achievements
and that it will take mainland China almost the same amount of time
to do the same.</P>
      <P>Hsiao suggested that the leadership on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait should focus their attention on dealing with their respective
domestic problems rather than wasting time and energy on cross-strait
wrangling.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait political disputes or discrepancies should not be
put at the top of the priority list and should instead be left to the
next generation to address, he continued.</P>
      <P>Hsiao made the remarks while attending the first round-table
discussion, which focused exclusively on cross-strait relations, at
the 2001 World Peace Forum initiated by Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>Wu Rong-yi, president of the private economics think-tank the
Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, who also spoke at the
round-table discussion, said Taiwan's "be patient, no haste" policy
toward mainland China is strategically correct.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should come up with effective measures to address related
issues at a time when Taiwan's economic dependence on mainland China
has become increasingly strong and when Beijing has not renounced the
use of force against the island to settle disputes, Wu added.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), Taiwan's top government agency in charge of
policies regarding mainland China, said Beijing's consistent military
threats and rhetoric toward Taiwan have basically remained unchanged
since President Chen Shui-bian took office in May 2000.</P>
      <P>For its part, the MAC has tried over the past year to uphold its
stance of maintaining "useful and constructive relations" with
mainland China while avoiding making remarks that might provoke
Beijing, Lin added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Defense Minister Chen Pi-chao warned that
mainland China, with the continuing build-up of its military and the
upgrading of its strategic applications, may gain the upper hand over
Taiwan militarily in the foreseeable future</P>
      <P>Mainland China's military upgrading includes increases in the
defense budget, new purchases of advanced weaponry from the Russian
Federation, and the promotion of younger officers.</P>
      <P>Ridiculing Beijing's description of itself as the "peace seeker"
while it simultaneously increases its military budget at a rate of 17
percent annually, Chen said mainland China has become the world's
major arms supplying country since the Soviet Union disintegrated.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged mainland
China Wednesday to make a positive response to the Republic of
China's olive branch by resuming the long-stalled dialogue between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen made the pitch in a written message read at the opening of a

also known as the "Voice from Taiwan: Peace and Love," activities,
organized by Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>In his message, Chen said his administration has continued to
promote cross-strait exchanges with goodwill ever since its
inauguration more than a year ago.</P>
      <P>"We look forward to seeing the Beijing authorities respond to our
olive branch and resume regular cross-strait dialogue in order to
forge a mutually beneficial cooperative relationship and lay a solid
foundation for eternal cross-strait peace," Chen said.</P>

regional and civil wars in the 20th century, Chen noted that war
brings only death, calamity and remorse.</P>
      <P>"As a result, peace has become a common goal and a universal
value. And history has proven that only love and respect can achieve
peace. All humans should learn a lesson from previous wars and work
together to avert war and create peace," the president stressed.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that although the Cold War has become history
along with the 20th century, crises of civil wars and regional
conflicts still lurk in many areas around the globe.</P>
      <P>"For instance, the Taiwan Strait has become a potential factor
affecting regional peace and world security due to a lack of
constructive communications between the two sides of the strait,"
Chen said, adding that he hopes cross-strait relations can improve as
soon as possible for the sake of mutual benefits and regional
stability.</P>
      <P>Vice President Lu, former South African President Fredrik W. de
Klerk and former Polish President Lech Walesa delivered speeches at
the opening ceremony. Both de Klerk and Walesa are Nobel Peace Prize
winners.</P>
      <P>Three other Nobel Peace Prize laureates -- former Costa Rican
President Oscar Arias Sanchez, Jody Williams, a U.S. anti-landmine
activist, and Joseph Rotblat, a British nuclear scientist who
advocates the elimination of nuclear arms around the world -- also
attended the ceremony.</P>
      <P>The participants further included scores of heads of
international NGOs and legislators from the United States, Holland,
Japan, South Korea, Thailand and the Philippines.</P>
      <P>Several ROC government officials and scholars, including Mainland
Affairs Council Vice Chairman Lin Chong-pin and Vice Minister of
National Defense Chen Pi-chao, presented papers on cross-strait
relations for discussion at the forum.</P>
      <P>The forum focused its discussions Wednesday on relations across
the Taiwan Strait as well as Asia-Pacific security and stability and
the experience of war and peace.</P>
      <P>An outdoor concert, titled "An Evening for Global Peace," was
scheduled to be held later in the evening in the square in front of
Taipei's Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, where Lu and the five Nobel
laureates were to jointly inaugurate a "Terrestrial Globe of Peace"
in commemoration of the end of World War II 56 years ago.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP ESTABLISHES TAIWAN-JAPAN GOODWILL ASSOCIATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  15  (CNA)
(By Deborah
Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) formally established the Taiwan-Japan Goodwill
Association Wednesday to further bolster bilateral ties between the
two countries.</P>
      <P>Addressing a ceremony marking the association's founding, DPP
Chairman Frank Hsieh said the Taiwan-Japan Goodwill Association has
vowed to break diplomatic restrictions to help cement substantive
bilateral exchanges between Taiwan and Japan based on a "win-win"
approach.</P>
      <P>Hsieh noted that private bilateral exchanges between Taiwan and
Japan, two neighboring countries located only 116 km apart, have
never declined since the two countries severed formal diplomatic
relations in 1972.</P>
      <P>On the contrary, he went on, business and tourism exchanges have
increased by leaps and bounds over the years.</P>
      <P>The absence of formal ties between the two sides has meant that
exchanges have had to be taken care of by non-governmental groups,
including city and county councils or sub-groups of political
parties, such as the new association, Hsieh added.</P>
      <P>Presidential Secretary General Yu Shyi-kun, on behalf of
President Chen Shui-bian, turned up at the ceremony to congratulate
Hsieh -- who will serve as chairman of the association -- over the
founding of the association.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the inaugural ceremony, Yu said Japan is Taiwan's
largest source of import trade and vice versa and that both countries
are widely considered as the two most democratic nations in the
region -- all factors indicating that the two countries have
maintained close long-term ties despite the absence of formal
diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>Also on hand to celebrate the association's establishment were
Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Chiu Jong-nan; Lin Chin-chin, president
of the Association of East Asian Relations; and Shintaro Yamashita,
director-general of the Interchange Association of Japan.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite a global economic downturn,
Taiwan's information application (IA) industry is expected to
continue growing in the coming years, according to forecasts made
public Wednesday by the Market Information Center (MIC) under the
Institute for Information Industry (III).</P>
      <P>In 2000, Taiwan produced 5.97 million units of thin client
computers, smart handheld devices and NetTVs -- the country's three
major IA products -- and the number is expected to climb to 8.6
million and 11.4 million in 2001 and 2002, an increase of 44.1
percent and 32.5 percent, respectively, according to MIC statistics.</P>
      <P>With the statistics broken down further, output units of thin
client computers will increase from 598,000 units in 2000 to 728,000
units this year, while the number of handheld devices and NetTVs will
grow to 2.27 million units and 5.61 million units, up from 1.21
million and 4.15 million, respectively.</P>
      <P>In terms of production value, the combined figure of the three
kinds of products totaled US$1.24 billion last year and is forecast
to rise to US$1.81 billion and US$2.31 billion in 2001 and 2002,
respectively, representing growth of 46 percent and 27.5 percent for
the two years.</P>
      <P>An MIC official suggested that Taiwan should integrate the "five
C's" -- consumers, communications, computers, contents,
control-technology -- to explore Internet-related application markets
such as the automobile, aviation and construction industries, in line
with comprehensive distribution networks and after-sales services.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Scores of former RCA Taiwan workers
demonstrated at the site of a global peace forum Wednesday, urging
the participants in the conference to help them resolve an alleged
occupational disaster dispute.</P>
      <P>The former RCA Taiwan employees wore headbands and chanted
slogans: "We want world peace and labor safety; no war; no
occupational disasters; and no occupational injuries" in front of the
hotel where an opening ceremony for the "World Peace Forum" was being
held.</P>
      <P>The demonstrators claimed that water and soil pollution at the
now-defunct RCA plant in the northern Taiwan county of Taoyuan is
responsible for 1,375 cases of cancer and 216 deaths among former RCA
Taiwan employees.</P>
      <P>The petitioners likened environmental pollution and occupational
disasters to "invisible mass homicide." They urged Republic of China
Vice President Annette Lu, organizer of the peace forum, and the five
Nobel Peace Prize winners and several American congressmen who were
attending the forum, to help push RCA's U.S. parent company to send
officials to handle their compensation claims.</P>
      <P>RCA first set up production lines in Taoyuan in 1970 to produce
television sets and other electronic home appliances. After the
plant's closure in 1991, it was disclosed that a well had been dug at
the factory for the underground dumping of toxic by-products.</P>
      <P>The soil and underground water used by RCA employees was later
confirmed to be heavily contaminated by trichloroethylene and
tetrachloroethylene. A government report indicated that the solvents
greatly heightened the risk of cancer in the neighborhood of the
plant.</P>
      <P>The World Peace Forum is part of the 2001 Global Peace Assembly,
also known as the "Voice from Taiwan: Peace and Love" activities
organized by Lu.</P>
      <P>Five Nobel laureates -- former South African President Fredrik W.

    <HEADLINE>NOBEL PEACE LAUREATE CALLS FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS BAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  15  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>1995 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Joseph
Rotblat called Wednesday on the nations of the world to ban nuclear
weapons and instead devote themselves to world peace.</P>
      <P>The British scientist who advocates the elimination of nuclear
arms made the call at seminar titled "Experience of War and Peace"
held at a Taipei hotel. The seminar was part of the two-day "Voice
from Taipei: Peace and Love" campaign initiated by Republic of China
Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>Rotblat said that the nuclear arms race between the United States
and the Soviet Union during the Cold War period had nearly destroyed
the earth and terminated mankind.</P>
      <P>Today, the nuclear crisis has eased somewhat following the end of
the Cold War, Rotblat said, adding that it has not actually ended as
there are still thousands of nuclear bombs in the world.</P>
      <P>He said that he is now launching a campaign to urge the countries
of the world to sign a treaty by which nuclear would be made illegal.</P>
      <P>Echoing Rotblat's call, Association of World Citizens Chairman
Douglas Mattern said at the seminar that the world as a whole pours
US$800 billion into military spending every year and that over 3,000
nuclear warheads are held by the so-called "nuclear club" countries.</P>
      <P>With such a large amount of money being spent on military
buildup, only a limited "leftover" budget can be used for
humanitarian relief work, he added.</P>
      <P>Jody Williams, the 1997 Nobel Prize winner and anti-land mine
activist from the United States, called for persistent efforts for
peace, saying that the greatest possible efforts by everybody can
change the world.</P>
      <P>Varahagiri Mohini Giri, former chairman of India's Women's Rights
Association said that waiting itself will not end war, and she added
that the both sides of the Taiwan Strait should try to reduce
hostility toward each other through dialogue and cultural exchanges.</P>
      <P>Some 80 prominent international figures, including five Nobel
Prize winners and NGOs delegates from around the countries are taking
part in the campaign.</P>
      <P>An outdoor concert titled "an Evening for Global Peace," will be
held in the evening in the square in front of Taipei's Chiang

      <P>The China Reunification Alliance (CRA), a
local organization promoting the reunification of China, staged a
sit-in protest Wednesday in front of the Japan Interchange
Association's Taipei Office against Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro
Koizumi's visit to the Yasukuni War Shrine.</P>
      <P>The protesters said that Taiwan was a victim of Japanese
militarism, and after marching from the Japan Interchange Office to
the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, they asked Republic of China Vice
President Annette Lu to "say no" to the Japanese government at the
2001 Global Peace Assemble she has initiated.</P>
      <P>Koizumi's war shrine visit sparked criticism and fierce protests
from neighboring Asian countries and 20 South Koreans even chopped
off the tips of their little fingers in a public protest.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hsieh Chi-ta of the opposition New Party (NP), who
took part in the sit-in, called on the people of Taiwan to boycott
Japanese products.</P>
      <P>Referring to Japan's war criminals, many of whom are honored at
the Yasukuni shrine, Hsieh said that "the hatred can be forgiven but
can absolutely not be forgotten" because history should never be
forgotten.</P>
      <P>She also criticized the President Chen Shui-bian Administration
for its "weak response" to Koizumi's visit to the shrine and claimed
that the people of Taiwan have already forgotten that the Japanese
imperial army killed 35 million Chinese civilians and 3.5 million
Chinese soldiers during the eight-year Sino-Japanese War.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE  PRESIDENT  DISPUTES  BEIJING'S CLAIMS AT GLOBAL PEACE ASSEMBLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  15  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>At the opening of a forum on world peace
held in Taiwan Wednesday, Vice President Annette Lu disputed
Beijing's claim that Taiwan is a part of its territory.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening of the Global Peace Assembly, Lu cited
historical facts to debunk Beijing's claim of sovereignty over
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The country's first female deputy head of state said Taiwan was
formally made a province of Chinese territory in 1887 by Chin
dynasty leaders, although it had been farmed and developed by Chinese
long before that.</P>
      <P>But Chin dynasty rule of the island stopped in 1895 when the
island was ceded to Japan, which colonized the island for the next
five decades until 1945, the end of World War Two.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China (ROC) which led the Chinese to victory in
the eight-year war against Japan, took over the island after the war,
but the peace treaty concluded in San Francisco in 1951 between Japan
and the allied states in World War II passed up, on purpose, the
question of who owns Taiwan and left the ownership of the island
uncertain, Lu said.</P>
      <P>The historical background bears out the fact that the People's
Republic of China (PRC), founded in 1949 in Beijing, never exercised
jurisdiction over Taiwan, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Although Beijing often insists making "commitment to one China" a
prerequisite for forging diplomatic ties with foreign countries,
there are still 78 states that have forged ties with Beijing without
committing themselves on the issue. This fact proves countries that
recognize the PRC do not necessarily acknowledge the so-called "one
China" principle, she said.</P>
      <P>The 1971 United Nations resolution which recognized the PRC as
the sole legitimate ruler of China did not say who should represent
Taiwan, thus giving rise to false allegations that Taiwan is part of
China, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Although Beijing tells its people that both mainland China and
Taiwan are parts of China, it insists on international occasions that
the PRC is the only legitimate ruler of China and that Taiwan is one
of its provinces.</P>
      <P>Beijing's differing claims at home and abroad are a ploy to annex
Taiwan and downgrade it into "another Hong Kong or Macau," Lu said.</P>
      <P>Lu said Taiwan is neither Hong Kong, nor Macau, but a sovereign
state, and added that while its fate is up to the its 23 million
people, Beijing seems unable to come to terms with this fact.</P>
      <P>Lu went on to drum up support for the island's bids to join the
United Nations, saying that it is unfair to exclude the state from
the world organization in light of the fact that it is the world's
145th-biggest country, with the 43rd-biggest population, the
seventh-biggest in terms of overseas investment and the 13rd-biggest
trade nation in the world.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to beat Beijing in its own game, Lu said the PRC,
in its dispute with Taiwan, should fulfill the vow it made in the
1972 Shanghai Communique with the United State -- that it will
support repressed people and nations in their struggle for freedom.</P>
      <P>Lu said she hopes the participants in the forum, including five
Nobel Peace Prize winners, will put their heads together and come up
with ways for the PRC and the ROC to coexist peacefully for ever.</P>
      <P>The Global Peace Assembly was the climax of the "Voice from
Taiwan: Peace and Love" event which began Monday in Taipei and will
last through Thursday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SPECIALISTS DISCUSS HONG KONG-TAIWAN ECONOMIC RELATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  Aug.  15 (CNA)
(By Rabbit Lam, Mandy Wong &amp; Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Specialists from Taiwan and Hong Kong
attended the Fifth Hong Kong-Taiwan Economic and Trade Forum
Wednesday to discuss the future development of bilateral economic and
trade relations.</P>
      <P>Shea Jia-dong, chairman of the Taipei World Trade Center, said
that Taiwan and Hong Kong are competitors, but also cooperation
partners.</P>
      <P>Because of Hong Kong's sound financial management system and its
convenient flows of capital and cargo, he said, many Taiwan
enterprises have set up operational offices in Hong Kong to solicit
orders from big international companies.</P>
      <P>He added that Hong Kong has also played a very important role in
the flow of cross-Taiwan Strait capital and personnel exchanges in
the absence of direct links between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Shea asserted that once direct trade, transportation and postal
service links between Taiwan and mainland China are realized in the
wake of World Trade Organization (WTO) entry for both sides, Hong
Kong's role may become less important.</P>
      <P>Therefore, for the benefit of both sides, Shea suggested that
Taiwan and Hong Kong step up personnel exchanges and exchange their
experiences in investing in mainland China and in exploring foreign
markets.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that both sides coordinate their resources to
jointly develop the mainland market and promote the use of Hong
Kong's financial, transport and trade services and Taiwan's research
capability.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the leader of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council
said at the forum that Hong Kong's status as the region's financial
center cannot be replaced by any other mainland city after the
realization of the three direct links between Taiwan and the
mainland.</P>
      <P>He said that at least three functions of Hong Kong are
irreplaceable in the foreseeable future -- its financial center
status, the sound service system to support its foreign trade, and
the efficient sea, land and air transport network.</P>
      <P>The leader predicted a "triple win" for Taiwan, mainland China
and Hong Kong in the future, as Taiwan can employ its research and
development power to production in mainland China, while using Hong
Kong as a service center and trading base.</P>
      <P>Other dignitaries invited to speak at the forum included Liang
Kuo-hsin, deputy director-general of the Board of Foreign Trade under
Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT `EXPELS' 11 MEMBERS WHO JOINED NEWLY FOUNDED TSU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 15 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) decided as
expected Wednesday to formally "expel" 11 party members who left the
party to join the newly founded Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) that
will compete with the KMT in year-end legislative and county chief
elections.</P>
      <P>The party's supreme policy making body -- the Central Standing
Committee -- approved a motion by the party's Evaluation and
Discipline Committee to "kick out" the 11 members who publicly
declared their political switch during the inauguration of the TSU
Aug. 12.</P>
      <P>The party also decided that for the time being, it would not
address the issue concerning former KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui, who is
credited as being the spiritual leader of the TSU and who gave his
warm blessings to the TSU in person during its Aug. 12 inauguration.</P>
      <P>KMT authorities who paid close attention to Lee's speech on that
occasion decided that Lee's words did not amount to an endorsement of
the TSU's causes.</P>
      <P>KMT Central Standing Committee member Hung Hsiu-chu, who called
for Lee's expulsion for his role in forming the TSU, said afterward
that she agreed with her party's decision on Lee, as any disciplinary
action against him could backfire by making him into "a hero being
persecuted by his own party."</P>
      <P>However, Hung urged the party to apply its rules to all members
irrespective of their positions, which means even Lee should not be
spared from disciplinary action if he stumps for non-party members
during the forthcoming election.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien Chan was said to have remitted Hung's request
to the discipline committee for further study.</P>
      <P>According to reports, 12 KMT members are preparing to run on the
TSU ticket, but one of them was "coerced" by "exterior factors" and
was therefore exempted from the party ax, according to the Central
Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, three of those expelled Wednesday brought libel
actions against KMT disciplinary committee head Chen Keng-chin on the
grounds that they had quit the KMT when they swore allegiance to the
TSU Aug. 12 and that the KMT's decision to expel them is therefore
aimed at humiliating them rather than disciplining them.</P>
      <P>A KMT spokesman brushed aside the charges, saying the party
"prefers to let the law take its course."</P>
      <P>The TSU, organized by former Minister of the Interior Huang
Chu-wen, was formally founded Aug. 12 and is expected to field 39
candidates in the year-end legislative race. The candidates on the
party's ticket cover the whole gamut of Taiwan's political arena.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EDAC PANEL PROPOSES 1-YEAR SUSPENSION OF STOCK TRADING TAX</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  15  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Members of the Economic Development
Advisory Conference (EDAC) reached agreement at a panel discussion
Wednesday that the government should suspend the stock transaction
tax for one year in a bid to help prop up the local stock exchange.</P>
      <P>Local share prices have nose-dived, with the weighted index
halved to around 4,500 points recently from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>The panel also suggested that the land value increment tax, which
is levied upon land transactions, be suspended for two years in order
to help stimulate the construction industry -- considered to be the
driving force of traditional industries.</P>
      <P>Chen Po-chih, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, said at the meeting that Taiwan's tax revenue as a
percentage of its gross national product (GDP) is already the lowest
among the industrialized countries and that the rate is expected to
further drop to a historic low of 12 percent this year, substantially
undermining the nation's competitive edge.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, participants of an another EDAC panel discussion
agreed that the total number of foreign workers in Taiwan should be
frozen at a certain level. Taiwan currently employs around 300,000
foreign laborers, mostly from Thailand, the Philippines and
Indonesia.</P>
      <P>The agreements reached at the EDAC panel meetings will be
forwarded to EDAC, which is scheduled to convene later this month to
further deliberate over the discussions before submitting them to the
government for reference in policy-making .</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu urged Beijing's
leaders to react in kind to the "peace-loving people of Taiwan" at a
Wednesday night rally called to mark the end of World War Two.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the Evening for Global Peace rally, staged in
the plaza of Taipei's Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, Lu said that 56
years ago to the day, Japan capitulated, formally ending World War
Two.</P>
      <P>The rally, which is a part of Lu's three-day "Voice from Taiwan:
Peace and Love" campaign, was organized to mark "the people's desire
that there will be no more war, bloodshed and violence."</P>
      <P>Lu said the rally is meant to show the world that Taiwan is a
peacemaker rather a troublemaker.</P>
      <P>Noting that the desire for peace transcends national boundaries,
Lu said she hopes the aspirations of the Taiwan people for peace will
inspire the people of mainland China and their leaders to pursue
peace across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Stressing that people of integrity will find companions wherever
they go, Lu said the Republic of China is an "exemplary state" and
will "never be isolated" in the international community despite
Beijing's efforts to shut it out of international bodies.</P>
      <P>When Lu delivered her speech, a small group of people who favor
reunification with mainland China, demonstrated near the rally site.
They handed out leaflets and chanted "Peace, Yes, Taiwan
Independence, No," until they were persuaded by police to leave.</P>
      <P>Five Nobel Peace Prize winners who were invited to take part the
"Voice from Taiwan: Peace and Love" campaign joined Lu and some 5,000

(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
indicated Wednesday that the "go slow, be patient" policy governing
local investment in mainland China will be adjusted.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while speaking at a dinner in honor of
several foreign dignitaries, including U.S. Congressman Ben Gilman
and his wife, and former congressmen Frank Guarini and Lester Wolff.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he proposed in his "cross-century message of Dec.
31 last year that the "go slow, be patient" policy should be replaced
with "positive opening and efficient control," and added that his
proposal has now been endorsed by the Cross-Strait Affairs Division
of the Economic Development Advisory Conference.</P>
      <P>However, the president stressed that before implementing the
"positive opening," four principles must be enforced -- Taiwan first,
global consideration, a mutually beneficial win-win situation, and
sound risk management.</P>
      <P>During the talks, Chen expressed his thanks to his visitors for
their support for Taiwan's interests. The visitors were in Taiwan
attending the "World Peace Forum" at the invitation of ROC Vice
President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>Chen also reiterated his hope that he will be allowed to attend
the informal leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum scheduled to be held in Shanghai in late October.</P>
      <P>He said that if the leaders of Taiwan and the mainland can engage
in talks on topics of mutual concern, it would be a big help in the
security and stability across the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REUNIFICATION OF TAIWAN AND MAINLAND INEVITABLE: EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  15  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A renowned American expert on Asian
affairs recently wrote that the reunification of Taiwan with mainland
China is inevitable but will take many years, probably decades, to
occur and may not happen until Communist China's political system
changes.</P>
      <P>Michael A. McDevitt, director of the Center for Strategic Studies
at the Center for Naval Analyses, wrote in the latest issue of the
PacNet Newsletter, published by the Center for Strategic and
International Studies' Pacific Forum, that Taiwan is on the seam
between Communist China's geographic sphere of military influence on
the Asian continent and the United States' military sphere of
influence on the rim of East Asia.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is far enough off-shore from mainland China to be out of
reach of mainland China's military, the retired rear admiral pointed
out, adding that for the last 50 years, the United States' naval
power, deployed from facilities in Japan, has kept Taiwan out of
Beijing's grasp.</P>
      <P>McDevitt noted that "this is one aspect of history that is
unlikely to change until Taipei and Beijing reach an understanding on
how to reconcile a vibrant democracy on Taiwan and growing Chinese
impatience for `reunification of the motherland.'"</P>
      <P>Because the United States stands ready to prevent Taiwan from
being militarily intimated into reunifying with the mainland,
"Beijing needs to appreciate that the military option remains
essentially foreclosed," he wrote.</P>
      <P>"The only course open to Beijing is to rely on political, social
and economic initiatives to make the people of Taiwan see the
advantages of once and for all removing the threat of war by reaching
some sort of political accommodation with China," he explained.</P>
      <P>McDevitt said he is convinced that this will undoubtedly take a
long period of time to occur and "may not transpire until China's
political system changes, but it will have to happen.</P>
      <P>"One aspect of history that is relevant to the future is the
likelihood that China will continue to cling fiercely to the notion
that reunification with Taiwan is the only way to make China whole,"
he said.</P>
      <P>The Asian affairs expert stressed that the latest diplomatic flap
between Japan and mainland China as well as South Korea about Japan's
militaristic past, while important in its own right, "must not
overshadow the most important geo-strategic issue for the future --
the rise of China,"</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT JOINT-VENTURE OIL EXPLORATION PLAN REVIVED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  16  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A joint-venture plan involving flagship
Taiwan and mainland Chinese petroleum corporations exploring for oil
in the Taiwan Strait has recently been revived after a five-year
hiatus.</P>
      <P>A draft agreement on the plan was jointly inked in 1996 by
Overseas Petroleum Investment Co. (OPIC), an offshoot of Taiwan's
state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC), and the Beijing-based China
National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), featuring joint oil
exploration in waters located southeast of the mouth of mainland
China's Zhujiang (Pearl River), CPC sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Encompassing 15,400 square kilometers, the targeted area
straddles the imaginary demarcation mid-line in the Taiwan Strait
that has been tacitly accepted by both Taipei and Beijing for
decades.</P>
      <P>The OPIC-CNOOC cooperative project was called to a halt later in
1996 after former Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui called for
the "no haste, be patient" policy to curb fast-growing Taiwan
economic and business expansion into mainland China.</P>
      <P>If everything goes smoothly, a formal pact on the OPIC-CNOOC
cooperation is expected to be formally signed by the end of this
year, paving the way for the two companies to launch formal
exploratory drilling, probably in 2002, CPC officials said.</P>
      <P>The cooperative project is expected to usher in a new era of
cooperation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in exploring
for and tapping oil reserves in the Taiwan Strait and other areas.</P>
      <P>Under the initial contract, OPIC and CNOOC will each contribute
US$500,000 for oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG) exploration in the
targeted area, which lies 250 kilometers southwest of the southern
Taiwan city of Kaohsiung and 150 kilometers south of the city of
Swatow in the mainland Chinese province of Guangdong.</P>
      <P>Experts from both sides are optimistic about the prospects of the
cooperative project, saying that the targeted area is rich in oil and
LNG resources. The seven fields found over the years near the mouth
of the Pearl River are expected to produce about 10 million tons of
petroleum per year, they added.</P>
      <P>Before the implementation of the Taiwan's "no haste, be patient"
policy, high-ranking officials from CPC and CNOOC had met many times
on different occasions for seminars and workshops, tangibly for the

    <HEADLINE>DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT SEA-AIR TRANSSHIPMENT SERVICES KICK OFF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  16  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Direct sea-air transshipment services
across the Taiwan Strait has kicked off to a smooth start, with the
first installment of cargoes from mainland China being airlifted to
Europe via Taiwan late Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Airline sources said Thursday that the Republic of China's
decision to expand the functions of its Kaohsiung offshore
cross-strait transshipment center to cover airborne transshipment
services has received positive response from manufacturers in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>The first batch of mainland cargoes to use this new channel
for transshipment was shipped to the southern Taiwan port of Kaohsiung
from mainland China's Xiamen via a vessel of the Taiwan-based
Uniglory Marine Corp. Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The 17 tons of cargoes, which would be airlifted to Europe and
the United States in three installments, were then transported to CKS
International Airport in northern Taiwan via truck.</P>
      <P>The first installment, weighing more than two tons, was
airlifted to Paris via an EVA Airways cargo plane Wednesday evening.
EVA sources said before the opening of the airborne transshipment
services, it took five to seven days to send goods from mainland
China to Europe via the Kaohsiung offshore transshipment center.</P>
      <P>"Now, it takes only 48 hours for the cargoes to reach Paris,"
said an EVA executive.</P>
      <P>The two remaining installments of goods were airlifted to
Amsterdam and New York, respectively, via EVA cargo planes Thursday.</P>
      <P>The EVA executive said as the export destinations of mainland
Chinese goods cover a wide range of areas, the newly opened
cross-strait sea-air transshipment services can help enhance mainland
exporters' speed and flexibility in cargo delivery.</P>
      <P>Both Uniglory Marine and EVA Airways are affiliates of Taiwan's
Evergreen Group, which operates the world's largest container
shipping fleet.</P>
      <P>The executive said as Evergreen Group has long developed a
convenient sea-land-air transport network in Europe and the United
States, it has managed to become the first company to offer direct
cross-strait sea-air transshipment services to mainland Chinese
manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC) said Thursday it plans to further expand the functions of
the Kaohsiung offshore transshipment center to include direct
cross-strait air-sea transshipment services, under which
mainland China-bound goods from third countries can be airlifted to
Taiwan's two international airports for transport via ship from
Kaohsiung Harbor to mainland ports. Nevertheless, trade sources said
the demand such a type of transshipment services may not be
large.</P>
      <P>In the future, MOTC Vice Minister Ho-Chen Tan said the
Kaohsiung offshore transshipment center may also be allowed to
handle export processing and packaging for mainland products to
be exported to third countries.</P>
      <P>At present, mainland goods to be transshipped to third
countries via Kaohsiung can neither clear customs nor enter Taiwan
proper.</P>
      <P>Ho-Chen said if the soon-to-be-convened Economic Development
Advisory Conference manages to reach a conclusion on further easing
cross-strait transportation services, the MOTC will revise current
regulations governing the offshore transshipping center operations
to accommodate the above-mentioned new services.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 16 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The announcement Wednesday afternoon of the
merger between Yuanta Core Pacific Securities Co. and Sampo
Securities Co. is being seen by Taiwan's market observers as the
beginning of another wave of mergers of securities houses aimed at
improving the companies' competitiveness.</P>
      <P>At the end of last year, a series of such mergers changed the
landscape of the securities business in Taiwan, and the leading
securities houses have been playing even more predominant roles in
the market since then.</P>
      <P>The Yuanta Core Pacific Securities Co. is already the biggest
securities house in Taiwan, taking 7.45 percent of the market share.
When Sampo's 0.51 percent market share is added after the merger,
other securities houses will likely find it even more difficult to
challenge Yuanta Core Pacific's leading position.</P>
      <P>According to the general manager of Yuanta Core Pacific
Securities Co., Chang Li-chiu, the company has 69 posts around the
island and Sampo has 14. An important task in the merger process will
be to avoid any overlapping of their operations, he added.</P>
      <P>Chang said that Yuanta Core Pacific's capital value amounts to
NT$23.62 billion and its net assets total NT$45.78 billion, while
Sampo's capital value amounts to NT$3.78 billion and its net assets
total NT$3.89 billion.</P>
      <P>Under the merger agreement, one Yuanta Core Pacific share will
trade for 2.5 Sampo shares. The new company's capital value will
amount to NT$25.13 billion and its net assets will total NT$49.67
billion.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the Yuanta Core Pacific Co. is contacting other
small securities houses to look into further merger possibilities in
a bid to maintain its predominant role in the market.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Polish President Lech Walesa said
Thursday in Taipei that mainland China should feel obliged to Taiwan
for bringing it an inspiration for democracy and allowing both sides
of the Taiwan Strait to stride into the global market of democracy.</P>
      <P>Walesa, who is currently in Taipei mainly to take part in the
2001 Global Peace Assembly forum hosted by Vice President Annette Lu,
called at the Legislative Yuan where he met with his "old friend"
former Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Shih Ming-teh for a
chat.</P>
      <P>The labor union leader-turned Polish president said the
cross-Taiwan Strait issue, which has gained increasing attention in
the international community in recent years, should be addressed in a
rational and peaceful manner as the world has entered the 21st
century and it is no longer an era of wars.</P>
      <P>Walesa said the cross-strait issue is indeed a thorny one, but he
called for the leadership on both sides to "live here and now, and
never look back."</P>
      <P>For his part, Shih, a dissident-turned-politician and now an
Independent legislator, again offered his appreciation to Walesa for
the latter's endorsement several years ago of Shih to be nominated
for the Nobel Peace Prize.</P>
      <P>Shih gave high marks to Walesa's contributions to Poland's
hard-earned democratization, calling him "the first gunshot in the
disintegration of the Soviet Union."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  16  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Development of aerospace technology is
critical to Taiwan's well-being, a former chief architect of the U.S.
national missile defense (NMD) system said in Taipei Thursday.</P>
      <P>Charles A. Horner, a former North American Defence and U.S. Space
Commander-in-Chief, made the remarks while attending an opening
ceremony for the 2001 Taipei Aerospace Technology Exhibition.</P>
      <P>Horner said he thinks that Taiwan should devote more energy to
aerospace technology development in the face of mainland China's
perennial military threat.</P>
      <P>Horner, a Persian Gulf War hero, said the United States was able
to easily win the 1991 Persian Gulf War, also known as Operation
Desert Storm, mainly because of its successful aerospace technology
development.</P>
      <P>Horner is visiting Taiwan at the invitation of the Taiwan branch
of the U.S.-based defense equipment firm Northrop Grumman. During his
stay, he is scheduled to meet with Republic of China Air Force
Commander-in-Chief Chen Chao-min and other relevant government
officials.</P>
      <P>As Horner used to be one of the chief planners of the U.S. NMD
program, local pundits are interested in whether Horner will exchange
views with top ROC military officers on the NMD project as well as on
the possibility of Taiwan joining the U.S.-initiated theater missile
defense (TMD) project.</P>
      <P>In response to the question, Horner said that as he has retired
from public service, he is not in a position to discuss the issue.
Horner said he takes great pleasure in visiting Taiwan again.</P>
      <P>"I like Taipei very much," he said, adding that he will meet with
ROC defense ministry officials during his current visit.</P>
      <P>As for Taiwan's aerospace technology development, Horner said
quality is of the most importance. "You must make every possible
effort to ensure quality in aerospace industry development," he
added.</P>
      <P>In related news, the Taiwan representative of U.S.-based Bell
Helicopter Textron Inc. said that as the U.S. Army will stop
supporting services for production of the UH-1H helicopter in 2004,
Taiwan may have difficulties securing spare parts and related
components for its fleet of UH-1H helicopters.</P>
      <P>Bell is promoting two new types of helicopters -- the AH-1Z Super
Cobra helicopter and an upgraded version of the UH-1H helicopter --
at the ongoing Taipei aerospace show.</P>
      <P>Bell originally hoped to sell a special 412 type of helicopter to
Taiwan in 1999. But the ROC Army later decided to purchase new tanks
and missiles first and shelve its new helicopter procurement plan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) remains "prudently optimistic" regarding the
development of bilateral ties between Taiwan and the United States in
the second half of 2001, a MOFA official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Stanley Kao, director general of the MOFA's Department of North
American Affairs, said a great number of U.S. congressmen have paid
visits to Taiwan in spate this year, particularly since midyear,
indicated a warming up of substantive bilateral relations between the
United States and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition to increased visits by U.S. lawmakers to Taiwan, Kao
said the MOFA has maintained smooth communications channels with
relevant official agencies in Washington.</P>
      <P>During their visits in Taiwan, the U.S. lawmakers, including Sen.
Joseph Biden, a Delaware Democrat and chairman of the Senate
Committee on Foreign Relations, and Rep. Ben Gilman, a Republican
from New York and an honorary chairman of the U.S. House of
Representatives' Committee on International Relations, reiterated the
United States' concern about security and stability in the Taiwan
Strait, Kao added.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers also reiterated the U.S. commitments to Taiwan
stipulated by the Taiwan Relations Act, Kao said, adding that all
these developments have had a positive effect on efforts to upgrade
substantive relations between Taiwan and the United States.</P>
      <P>On the heels of Biden and Gilman's visits, a 21-member delegation
to be led by Texas Republican Rep. Tom DeLay, majority whip in the
U.S. House of Representatives, and a 25-member delegation to be
headed by Rep. Henry Hyde, an Illinois Republican and chairman of the
U.S. House of Representatives Committee on International Relations,
are scheduled to visit Taiwan next week.</P>
      <P>Dyde is expected to deliver a speech of high importance to his
Taiwan friends during his stay in Taipei, according to Kao.</P>
      <P>In regard to an expectant meeting between U.S. President George
W. Bush and mainland Chinese President Chiang Zemin during a summit
meeting under the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to be held
in Shanghai in October, Kao said the MOFA would welcome such a
meeting so long as such engagement activities are conducive to
bolstering security and stability for the entire Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kao said it is hoped that Taiwan's interests are not
compromised when the United States conducts "engagement" interactions
with mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT DIALOGUE IN INTEREST OF BOTH SIDES: U.S. ENVOY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  16  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Putting aside poltiical factors and the
"one China" controversy is a "wise formula" for the two sides of the
Taiwan strait to resume dialogue, the de facto U.S. ambassador to
the Republic of Chian said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Raymond Burghardt, director of the Taipei office of the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT), which represents U.S. interests in the
ROC in the absence of formal diplomatic ties, made the remarks in a
speech delivered at a seminar on the crises and opportunities for
cross-strait peace.</P>
      <P>Burghardt said he doesn't think that the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait would face a crisis of military conflict in the next few
years as the top leaders on both sides do not want to impair the
current fragile peace in the strait.</P>
      <P>Either Taian declares independence or mainalnd China takes
military action againt Taiwan would destroy this fragile peace,
Burghardt warned.</P>
      <P>In his view, Burghardt said, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
need not continue their squabbling over whether they reached a
consensus on the "one China" issue in 1992.</P>
      <P>The two sides should instead ditch their "one China" dispute and
sit down to discuss practical issues immediately, Burghardt said.
Perhaps, he added, the two sides would come to understand before
long that the most important, genuine and only consensus reached in
their 1992 and 1998 meetings was that it's in the interest of both
sides to engage in dialogue.</P>
      <P>Burghardt further said the government is not the only driving
force behind peace. In fact, he said, the academic, investment,
trade and cultural exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait since 1988 have been the most important process to create
peace.</P>
      <P>This process has let the two sides forge a multilayer
interdependent relationship, Burghardt said, adding that development
of cross-strait trade and economic ties should never be stopped by
either side simply for political reasons.</P>
      <P>Burghardt went on to say that Beijing is wrong to accuse the
United States of using Taiwan as an "invincible aircraft carrier" to
contain mainland China.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the U.S. commitment to Taiwan as embodied
in the Taiwan Relations Act is purely based on their long-term common
values. And such common values have helped boost Taiwan's
democratization over the past years, Burghardt said.</P>
      <P>The de facto U.S. ambassador reiterated that the
fundamental U.S. policy on cross-strait issues is that any
dispute should be resolved strictly by peaceful means and that any
solution should respect the free will of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition, Burghardt said the United States has consistently
encouraged the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to resume
peaceful dialogue without setting any political conditions or
trappings.</P>
      <P>The seminar, part of the 2001 Global Peace Assembly activities,
was chaired by Benjamin Gilman, chairman of the Committee on
International Relations of the U.S. House of Representatives.</P>
      <P>Gilman said Beijing's pressuring the international
community and Taiwan to accept its claim that "Taiwan is part of
China" has made mainland China a source of regional tension and
crisis.</P>
      <P>In his view, Gilman said the People's Republic of China,
mainland China's official title, and the Republic of China on Taiwan
enjoy equal, separate sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Gilman said the international community must accept this fact
because it is key to peace in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The Global Peace Assembly, also known as the "Voice from Taiwan:
Peace and Love" campaign, was organized by ROC Vice President
Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>Five Nobel Peace Prize winners -- former South African President
Fredrik W. de Klerk, former Polish President Lech Walesa, former
Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez, Jody Williams, a U.S.
anti-landmine activist, and Joseph Rotblat, a British nuclear
scientist who advocates the elimination of nuclear arms around the
world -- have been invited to attended the two-day
activities.</P>
      <P>The participants further included scores of heads of
international NGOs and legislators from the United States, Holland,
Japan, South Korea, Thailand and the Philippines. The peace campaign
ended Thursday afternoon with the issue of a number of conclusions on
promoting world peace.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN IS `NOT ISOLATED': VICE PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 16 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Annette Lu
claimed Thursday that Taiwan is "no longer isolated in the world
community" as its voice calling for peace is supported by many "world
peace lovers."</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks in a speech marking the end of a series of
activities dubbed the "Voice from Taiwan: Peace and Love" campaign
that she initiated.</P>
      <P>International figures including Nobel Peace Prize laureates,
parliamentarians, NGO representatives and scholars gathered in Taiwan
Aug. 15-16 to offer their experiences and inspiration to not only
preserve peace and security across the Taiwan Strait, but also around
the world.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, the principles of "soft power" -- which she said
includes democracy, human rights, high-technology, peace and love --
that she has been advocating for years have finally obtained the
support of friends of Taiwan that came to the island to take part in
the campaign.</P>
      <P>The vice president said she once donated money to Jody Williams'
anti-land mine organization and to India for rescue efforts, and that
she has obtained support from these two sources as a result.</P>
      <P>She went on to say that Taiwan has never brought problems to the
world and has conquered poverty during the past 50 years, with its
per capita income reaching US$15,000 at present.</P>
      <P>In the two-day campaign, the participants highlighted six
principles of peace-making that they said can be applied to resolving
the conflict in the Taiwan Strait. They are as follows:</P>
      <P>-- Acknowledge that problems can only be solved through
negotiation: Since Taiwan has renounced the use of force, the
People's Republic of China should also renounce the use of force and
threat of war, while both sides should be prepared to compromise;</P>
      <P>-- Build trust and confidence: Both sides should encourage
further exchanges within society and uphold the principles of parity
and mutual respect in the negotiation process;</P>
      <P>-- Create win-win outcomes: Both sides should abandon one-sided
solutions that disregard the current reality;</P>
      <P>-- Establish concrete mechanisms early in the peace process to
avoid deadlocks in negotiation: Both sides should find ways to keep
moving forward the cooperation to maintain dialogue;</P>
      <P>-- Practice patience and never give up trying: Both sides should
accept that obstacles will arise and should be creative in finding
new approaches; and</P>
      <P>-- Establish mechanisms for conducting the peace process: Both
sides should invite Nobel Peace Prize winners to suggest possible
methods to resume constructive dialogue and ultimately to achieve a
lasting and permanent peace.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP SECRETARY-GENERAL QUITS NEGOTIATIONS WITH KMT ON COOPERATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 16 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Talks on cooperation between the two major
opposition parties -- the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party
(PFP) -- took a wrong turn Thursday when PFP Secretary-General Chung
Jung-chi walked away from the negotiating table.</P>
      <P>Chung, who was charged by PFP Chairman James Soong with heading
up the negotiations with the KMT on choosing joint candidates in the
year-end county chief elections in 25 counties and cities, blamed the
KMT for having "no intention of supporting PFP members in any
county."</P>
      <P>He also warned the KMT that it will win no more than three county
halls without PFP support.</P>
      <P>Chung accused KMT party officials of ignoring or even reneging on
accords struck by its leaders with the PFP and of violating an
agreed-upon gag rule by leaking to mass media false information on
the unfinished negotiations.</P>
      <P>Chung noted that he had refrained from divulging any of the
results of the negotiations with KMT Secretary-General Lin
Fong-cheng.</P>
      <P>"But the KMT continues to give out misleading information, which
can't but lead me to suspect that senior KMT sources are either out
of touch with the talks or have ulterior motives," said Chung.</P>
      <P>As an example, Chung noted that Lin told the mass media earlier
this month that the PFP supported the KMT's choice of Legislator Lin
chih-chia to run for magistrate in Taipei County, when he actually
told Lin "no comment" on the KMT decision.</P>
      <P>Chung said he made the "no comment" response after being told on
the phone by Lin that KMT had no choice but to nominate Lin.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Chung went on, the KMT is reluctant to endorse
PFP choices in Miaoli and Taitung counties, although the two
aspirants preferred by the PFP have considerable chances of winning.</P>
      <P>Saying that he is frustrated with the fruitless negotiations,
Chung said he would have no further involvement, although he claimed
that Soong did not blame him for the failure.</P>
      <P>Chung urged Soong to ask somebody else to conduct the
negotiations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an anonymous KMT official took Chung's announcement in
his stride Thursday, saying it is not news, as Chung has threatened
to withdraw from the talks many times.</P>
      <P>In a further blow to the idea of cooperation between the
opposition parties, the source also said that the KMT contact had
expressed similar frustrations and had asked to be relieved of the
task of negotiating with the PFP.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, the disarray once again apparent in the
opposition camps lies in the PFP's "fixation on its own narrow
views," which block the chances of cooperation.</P>
      <P>He criticized the PFP for doing exactly what it claimed the KMT
had done -- releasing distorted information that gave rise to
controversy.</P>
      <P>The KMT official also blamed PFP Deputy Chairman Chang
Chao-hsiung for making some "unfriendly" remarks about the KMT
recently, which he said is not helpful for bilateral cooperation.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the PFP look into Chang's background as a
"supporter of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party," saying that
this might have had something to do with his controversial remarks.</P>
      <P>However, Chao Shou-po, director-general of KMT Organization
Development Committee, claimed that the door to cooperation with PFP
will not be closed because of Chung's dropping out of the
negotiations.</P>
      <P>Noting that their "political cooperation" is meant to win the
election, Chao called on Chung not to be bothered by the ups and
downs of the negotiations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA WARNS OF NIGERIAN FRAUDSTERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  16  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The people of Taiwan should be wary of
e-mail fraud perpetrated by foreigners, the Republic of China
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) warned Thursday.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials warned Taiwan people to guard against scams that
often originate in Nigeria, whereby fraudsters send out mass
e-mailings in an attempt to swindle money from naive or greedy
people.</P>
      <P>According to the MOFA officials, the most recent of these e-mails
to make the rounds claims that Mariam Abacha -- the wife of a
disgraced former Nigerian president -- is seeking people in Taiwan to
"help her get her money out of a Nigerian bank" and is promising a 20
percent commission to anyone who can help her transfer the money.</P>
      <P>As is normal in this type of scam, the e-mail then says that the
new Nigerian government is currently settling and liquidating
Abacha's assets by freezing her bank deposits at home and abroad,
canceling all her VIP rights and arresting her eldest son.</P>
      <P>The e-mail then says that in order to free up the money, it must
be deposited in another account in a foreign country. Anyone naive --
or greedy -- enough to fall for the scam and replies to the original
e-mail receives a second message.</P>
      <P>The messages sometimes vary, but always say, in essence, that in
order to facilitate the transfer of funds, the recipient must provide
a sample of his firm's headed notepaper, together with bank account
information. An advance "handling fee" is sometimes also demanded.
Once the fraudsters receive this, they use the notepaper and the bank
information to clean out the victim's account.</P>
      <P>The trick, known as the "419 scam" because of the relevant number
in the Nigerian Criminal Code, is common and has been well-known
throughout the world since the 1980s, but as of 1996, had
nevertheless managed to dupe strangers out of an estimated US$5
billion.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui met Thursday with a group of Nobel Peace Prize winners and
participants in a "peace campaign" being conducted in Taiwan, and
exchanged views with them on world peace.</P>
      <P>Lee and the Nobel laureates, who include former South African
President F.W. de Klerk, former Polish President Lech Walesa and
former Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez, as well as
Association of World Citizens Chairman Douglas Mattern, were invited
to breakfast by ROC Vice President Annette Lu, who initiated the
series of activities dubbed "Voice from Taiwan: Peace and Love" that
were held Aug. 15-16.</P>
      <P>Lu praised the four former presidents as "history makers" and
"peace promoters" who had elevated their citizen's living standards
and "allowed world order to be maintained."</P>
      <P>She emphasized that peace shall only be achieved under the
premise of security, while national security depends largely on
preventive diplomacy.</P>
      <P>The vice president said it is Taiwan's honor to be able to invite
such renowned world figures to attend the peace campaign and added
her hope that it can contribute significantly to peace across the
Taiwan Strait and around the world.</P>
      <P>Lee said that cross-strait peace involves not only the
Asia-Pacific region but also the whole world. He expressed hope that
the visitors can pool their wisdom to contribute toward lasting peace
in the region.</P>
      <P>He noted that although the two sides of the Taiwan Strait opened
talks in 1992, the dialogue was interrupted unilaterally by Beijing
in 1995. Despite efforts by the Taiwan side, the talks still have not
resumed, Lee said.</P>
      <P>He urged Taiwan to participate in more world activities in the
future to promote world peace.</P>
      <P>For his part, Arias said that mainland China's economic reforms
will be accompanied by political reforms and he urged Taiwan to have
patience and wait. He also maintained that dialogue is the best way
to resolve conflict and expressed hope that both sides of the Taiwan
Strait can address their disputes through peaceful dialogue.</P>
      <P>De Klerk said Taiwan is in a situation similar to that of South
Africa during apartheid, when it was an international pariah.
However, he went on, Taiwan should not be treated so unfairly by the
world community, as its democratic, human rights and economic
developments are compliant with world trends.</P>
      <P>De Klerk also said that the cross-strait dispute can only be
resolved by dialogue and negotiation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Universities in Taiwan will be able to open
extension programs outside the island as early as February, according
to a Ministry of Education press statement released Thursday.</P>
      <P>The press release said that the ministry has acquiesced to local
universities' demands to be allowed to offer extension programs in
Southeast Asia and mainland China to Taiwan businessmen operating
there.</P>
      <P>It estimated the revision of current regulations to accommodate
the overseas education programs will be ready by February at the
earliest.</P>
      <P>The extension classes opened in mainland China will cater only to
Taiwan businessmen until such time as the government grants
credentials to mainland Chinese schools.</P>
      <P>It will open to mainland Chinese students only after the
government has certified the academic excellence of mainland Chinese
schools, said the press release.</P>
      <P>Although Minister of Education Ovid Tzeng has said he hopes the
policy of acknowledging academic credits granted by mainland Chinese
schools will be confirmed by the end of the year, many local
universities have jumped the gun by contacting mainland Chinese
authorities in the hope of opening extension classes for Taiwan
businessmen there.</P>
      <P>Under the ministry's plan, credits earned in the extension
programs will be applicable toward a bachelor or master degree.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Education Lu Mu-lin said the extension programs
may expand to the United States once the island is admitted to the
World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>However, he cautioned that local universities will have to
upgrade their academic levels if they want to attract foreign
students or else they will be edged out of the market by more
competitive rivals.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice Minister of
Economic Affairs Yin Chi-ming confirmed in San Francisco Wednesday
that an overseas Chinese group is considering establishing a large
bio-tech pharmaceutical manufacturing firm in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, he said that he could not disclose the name of the group
or whether the investment capital will top US$400 million, as had
been reported by local news media.</P>
      <P>If the project proceeds smoothly, Yin said that the firm "will
absolutely become the largest bio-tech pharmaceutical manufacturing
company in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>He said that his ministry "has considerable interest" in the
project because the development of bio-tech is in line with the
government's target set for the development of high-tech industries.</P>
      <P>The official went on to say that he had already asked the group
to make a sound assessment and present details of its operation plan
so that the ROC government can decide how the Executive Yuan's
development fund and a government-affiliated company can invest in
the venture.</P>
      <P>The overseas Chinese group was said to be hoping that Taiwan will
provide capital for the bio-tech venture.</P>
      <P>Yin came to San Francisco at the head of a delegation from Taiwan
to visit opto-communications firms in Silicon Valley and to solicit
foreign investment in Taiwan's high-tech industries.</P>
      <P>Members of the delegation are from the Ministry of Economic

      <P>Senator Joseph Biden, chairman of the
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, said on a television program
Wednesday that Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian understands
U.S. policy toward mainland China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Biden, who assumed the chairmanship of the committee last June,
headed a Senate mission on a visit to Taipei and Beijing early this
month for talks with Chen and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin,
respectively.</P>
      <P>Asked about the prospects for Taipei and Beijing reaching an
understanding, he said: "I don't think there's any prospect of
understanding in the near term, and as a final settlement."</P>
      <P>But Biden stated that there is a clear understanding on Chen's
part that "although we strongly support the Taiwan Relations Act,
which means we will allow them to be in a position to defend
themselves ... we do not support their independence."</P>
      <P>He said that the policy "was settled with Richard Nixon six
presidents ago," adding that although representing the "independence

      <P>"I know he understood it. He made it extremely clear that he
understood that," the senator went on.</P>
      <P>Regarding the current cross-Taiwan Strait situation, Biden said
that "there is a lessening" of the tension and added: "I don't see
any immediate flashpoint."</P>
      <P>He said that mainland China does not possess the capability to
take military action against Taiwan and that Taiwan is not prepared

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
caucus at the Legislative Yuan will support the easing of curbs on
trade with mainland China, party whip Legislator Tsai Huang-liang
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>After being briefed by Chairman of Mainland Affairs Council Tsai
Ing-wen on the consensus reached by a panel under the Economic
Development Advisory Conference, Legislator Tsai said his caucus will
support the panel's calls for relaxing restrictions on trade with
mainland China, even though it goes against the DPP's grain to engage
with Beijing and despite "noise" from within the party.</P>
      <P>He said there is still concern among DPP lawmakers that closer
trade with mainland China will deepen the hollowing out of Taiwan's
industry and sharpen the economic crisis the island is suffering.</P>
      <P>Some party lawmakers are also worried that the party's shift in
stance may cost it support from its radical members, who prefer to
keep mainland China at arm's length, he said.</P>
      <P>However, the DPP will subordinate its political interests to the
general welfare of the country and will throw its weight behind the
conclusions reached by EDAC, he went on.</P>
      <P>The remarks are in line with President Chen Shui-bian's
announcement Tuesday that his government will phase out the "no
haste, be patient" restrictions on trade with mainland China and
replace it with "aggressive opening and efficient regulation."</P>
      <P>It is Chen's idea to call on the EDAC to chart a path for the

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT COOPERATION IN CONSTRUCTING AIR CARGO TERMINAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  16 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The construction of an air cargo terminal
financed with investment from Taiwan and mainland China civil
aviation sectors began Thursday in Xiamen, in mainland China's Fujian
Province, according to local aviation officials.</P>
      <P>The venture marks the first step in cooperation between civil
aviation sectors of both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The construction of the 39,000 square meter terminal in Xiamen
International Airport will cost 224.5 million renminbi and is
expected to be completed late next year. It will be able to handle
150,000 tons of cargo annually once completed.</P>
      <P>An international air group under the Xiamen city government
accounts for 51 percent of the total investment, while a group of
Taiwan airlines account for the remaining 49 percent.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's major airlines, including China Airlines, EVA Airways
Corp. and Far East Air Transport Corp., are all participating in the
project.</P>
      <P>At the foundation-laying ceremony, a mainland Chinese official
responsible for civil aviation affairs urged Taiwan's aviation sector
to explore opportunities in eastern mainland China, which boasts 33
airports and accounts for 30 percent of the mainland's civil aviation
production, to pave the way for long-discussed direct links between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT POLICY BASED ON PUBLIC OPINION: PRESIDENT CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  16 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The implementation of government policies
should be based on public opinion and this is also the purpose behind
the government's holding of the Economic Development Advisory
Conference (EDAC), President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The government hopes to pool the wisdom from all social sectors
in a bid to forge consensus for Taiwan's future, Chen said in a
speech during visits to Quanta Computer based in Taoyuan County and
Powerchip Semiconductor Corporation based in the Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park.</P>
      <P>Hailing the outstanding performance achieved by Quanta's
management and staff amid the global recession, Chen said he agreed
with the remarks made by Quanta Chairman Barry Lam that "in the
present economic recession, we have to make greater efforts to look
to the needs and demands of the consumers so as to decide the next
move for devising and marketing new products."</P>
      <P>"Managing a business may differ from running a country, but the
key point to success is the same," the president said, adding that
the government must pay heed to social demand while seeking to
implement its policies. "An arrogant and obstinate government will
eventually be phased out," he said.</P>
      <P>Turning to the much discussed cross-Taiwan Strait trade ties,
Chen said the most important issue on this front is whether Taiwan
has full confidence to riding out the challenges by "surpassing
self-built barriers in order to explore more splendid horizons."</P>
      <P>In the face of fierce competition across the globe, Chen promised
to rally behind Taiwan's businesses to help them upgrade and
transform Taiwan's economy. He also pointed out that Taiwan should
focus on developing high value-added industries in the coming
knowledge-based economic era.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is now confronting a juncture in history, local
industries should realize that they must lay a solid foundation to
sharpen their competitiveness, he said, added that he is willing to
"get down on his knees" for the sake of a sound development of local
industries.</P>
      <P>According to the president, many environmental experts have
negatively affected local industrial development under the pretext of
"environmental protection consideration." He urged all such
professional experts not to negatively affect any investment projects
for the sake of the nation's economic development.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after learning that an expansion project of
a Taoyuan-based computer company had been delayed by environmental
protection officials.</P>
      <P>In response to the president's remarks, an official with the
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) said the expansion
project was blocked because the company had illegally started
construction before gaining approval of its environmental impact
report.</P>
      <P>The EPA official said the environmental assessment officials were
following the regulations set by the local government in
investigating the case, but he admitted that the overall environment
assessment system can be improved.</P>
      <P>As the central government has no say in such missions, which are
independently run by local governments, the EPA officials said
relevant government authorities are working on devising rules to
serve as a framework for future environmental assessment missions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN EASES RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSPORT LINKS WITH MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 16 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A cargo taken by ship from mainland China's
Xiamen City arrived in Taiwan's southern port of Kaohsiung Thursday
to be taken to the island's northern airport for transshipment
overseas, marking a further easing of restrictions on cross-strait
links.</P>
      <P>The ship, loaded with 17 tons of goods from Xiamen, was unloaded
at Kaohsiung in the afternoon from where the goods were transported
to Chiang Kai-shek Airport for transshipment to Paris, Amsterdam and
New York.</P>
      <P>Using the new route, it takes about 36 hours for cargoes to be
delivered to the above-mentioned destinations, about half of the time
in comparison to the old transshipment method by which mainland goods
are exported through either Shanghai, Guangzhou or Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The sea-air cross-strait links came one month after Taiwan's
Ministry of Transportation and Communications amended regulations to
expand cross-strait transportation links.</P>
      <P>Taiwan in 1997 inaugurated limited marine links across the strait
in which mainland-originating goods can be shipped to the offshore
shipping center in Kaohsiung for transshipment to other parts of the
world. But the goods cannot be unloaded in the island.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, another shipment of four tons of garments was being
shipped through Taiwan on the same route, ready to be flown overseas
Friday.</P>
      <P>Wu Chin-min, president of the Evergreen Marine Corp., estimated
that the cargo -- most of which will be electronic products produced
by Taiwan-invested plants in Fujian -- transported through the newly
opened line, will reach between 1,000 tons and 4,000 tons per month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN POLICE BUST CROSS-BORDER HEROIN TRAFFICKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Police busted three cross-border narcotics
traffickers Friday in Taipei, seizing four kilograms of high-grade
heroin with a street value of NT$20 million (US$580,000), sources
from the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB) said.</P>
      <P>The MJIB agents were able to nab the three suspects, including a
Taiwan male named Hsu Chiao-hua, a male Malaysian citizen surnamed
Hsiao, and a British man called Paul, after receiving a tip-off.</P>
      <P>A police group, under the leadership of Taipei district
prosecutor Chu Chao-min, was aware of the fact that the three men
flew into Taipei from Thailand late Thursday loaded with heroin and
then checked into two downtown hotels.</P>
      <P>The police waited until Friday morning and then raided one of the
hotels, nabbing Hsu and Hsiao. They then tracked down the British
suspect and arrested him at the other hotel. Hsiao and Paul were
found to be carrying 10 packages of heroin totaling four kilograms in
the inner compartments of their business suitcases.</P>
      <P>MJIB investigators believe that the three suspects were only
carrying out "downstream" errands for a well-organized international
drug ring which uses high pay to hire people like Hsu, Hsiao and Paul
to smuggle illegal narcotics from Thailand into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsu confessed that he and other international traffickers have
sneaked high-grade heroin from Thailand into Taiwan several times
over the past several months.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CEPD PUSHING AIR AND SEA TRANSSHIPMENT PLAN FOR KAOHSIUNG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  17  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) under the Executive Yuan is pushing with all out
effort the air-sea transshipment plan for southern Taiwan's port city
of Kaohsiung in order to strengthen its competitiveness.</P>
      <P>CEPD Chairman Chen Po-chih made the remarks while explaining the
air and sea transshipment plan at a seminar held in Kaohsiung on the
construction and trade opportunities of a center for global planning
and research.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Taiwan, located at the center of the Asia-Pacific
region, is a transport network linchpin, adding that the city of
Kaohsiung has the added advantage of having an international harbor
and airport.</P>
      <P>He noted that the average navigation time between Hong Kong and
the five other major harbors in the Asia-Pacific region is 64 hours,
the average between Shanghai and the five other major ports is 78
hours, and that for Singapore is up to 124 hours, while the average
time between Taiwan and the five major ports is only 53 hours.</P>
      <P>In addition to the navigation time advantage, Taiwan's average
flying time to seven major cities in the western Pacific is also the
shortest at only two hours and 55 minutes.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the CEPD is also planning to build a new harbor
outside Kaohsiung Harbor and to upgrade Kaohsiung Harbor's efficiency
in order to cut operation costs.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the CEPD will invest around NT$12.1 billion between
2002 and 2007 on building new roads connecting to Kaohsiung Harbor.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the air and sea transshipment plan will not be
limited to Kaohsiung Harbor and CKS International Airport or to
Kaohsiung Harbor and Kaohsiung's international airport, saying he
hopes that the plan will help maintain the management competitiveness
of Taiwan manufacturers as they will be able to make use of the
island's sea and air transshipment service to carry out their
international commercial activities.</P>
      <P>At present, the time it takes for ships to enter and depart
Kaohsiung Harbor averages 17.3 hours, down from an average of 21.5
hours in 1994, while the average time for imported cargo to clear
customs at CKS International Airport is two days, down from 4.2 days
in 1995.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EPA HEAD DEFENDS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REGULATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  17  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top environmental protection
official on Friday defended Taoyuan County's environmental impact
assessment regulations but also stressed that all the regulations
should be universally observed without exceptions.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the recent controversy between Taoyuan County
environmental authorities and the management of Quanta Computer Inc.
over an environmental impact assessment issue, which led to a strong
reaction from President Chen Shui-bian on Thursday, Hau Lung-pin,
administrator of the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA),
said environmental protection assessment systems and executive
policies should be fair, equitable and transparent, and should be
observed universally.</P>
      <P>Hau noted that Taoyuan County's environmental officials have
every right to impose stricter-than-standards rules in accordance
with the pollution conditions in Nankan River which flows near the
plants of Quanta Computer Inc., but he also stressed that the rules
should be imposed on all manufacturing companies in the county,
instead of on only a few.</P>
      <P>President Chen said Thursday that he is willing to "kneel down"
for the sake of speeding up the review process for Taiwan companies
seeking approval of their enivronment impact assessments for new
projects, blasting some local environmental officials for becoming a
"rock" on the road to development.</P>
      <P>During a visit to companies in Taoyuan County's science-based
industrial park Thursday, Chen criticized the local government for
setting environmental standards that are higher than those set by the
Cabinet and, as a result, causing delays in some high-technology
companies' operations and expansion.</P>
      <P>"I want to make a plea for the businesses. I can even kneel down
and beg. I hope that environmental officials do not rely only on
their specialized knowledge and keep dragging out the process," the
president said.</P>
      <P>The embattled Taoyuan County government, however, stressed later
in the day that environmental officials have not abused their
authority and that the county's evaluation standards are all in
accordance with the laws.</P>
      <P>On Friday, a spokesman for the Taoyuan environmental protection
authority said to the media, which again turned up at Nankan River to
see the pollution that has been caused by discharges from hi-tech
manufacturing companies along the river, that he believes President
Chen would not make such remarks on behalf of business if he saw the
level of pollution in the river.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.N. STEERING COMMITTEE TO DISCUSS ROC'S MEMBERSHIP BID SEPT. 12</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Aug.  16  (CNA)
(By Eric Tseng and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.N. Steering Committee will meet
Sept. 12 to discuss whether to include in the agenda of the next
General Assembly session a request by 10 of the Republic of China's
allies regarding its membership issue, U.N. sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>In an Aug. 8 joint letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
the 10 ROC diplomatic allies requested the inclusion in the agenda of
the 56th General Assembly a supplementary item asking the United
Nations to reconsider the abnormal situation of excluding the ROC.</P>
      <P>The U.N. Secretariat published the letter and an explanatory
memorandum attached to the letter earlier this week and has
distributed all these documents to U.N. member states.</P>
      <P>The supplementary item, titled "Need to examine the exceptional
international situation pertaining to the Republic of China on
Taiwan, and ensure that the fundamental right of its 23 million
people to participate in the work and activities of the United
Nations is fully respected," and the attached explanatory memorandum
have been published in six languages -- Chinese, English,
French, Russian, Spanish and Arabic.</P>
      <P>In their joint letter to Annan, the 10 ROC allies asked the U.N.
General Assembly to set up a special task force to work out measures
to ensure that the voice of the 23 million people of Taiwan be heard
in the United Nations and its related agencies.</P>
      <P>They also urged the United Nations to invite ROC representatives
to take part in the proposed working panel to facilitate its
operations.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the ROC allies urged the U.N. General Assembly and the
international community to express more concern about the development
of cross-Taiwan Strait relations and to encourage both sides to
resume peaceful dialogue.</P>
      <P>The 10 countries were Belize, Burkina Faso, Chad, Dominica, El
Salvador, The Gambia, Nicaragua, Palau, Senegal and Tuvalu.</P>
      <P>The ROC, a U.N. founding member, has been shut out of the United
Nations since 1971 when the General Assembly Resolution No. 2758
gave the China seat to the People's Republic of China, mainland
China's official title, at the expense of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This was the ninth time that ROC allies have filed such a
proposal to push the U.N. General Assembly to study measures for the
people of Taiwan's voice to be heard in the United Nations and its
affiliated organizations.</P>
      <P>In the past years, the ROC allies' proposal has consistently been
shot down at the U.N. Steering Committee due to mainland China's
opposition. The fate of this year's proposal "remains unclear." The
General Assembly is scheduled to begin its general debate session
Sept. 24.</P>
      <P>The ROC government has repeatedly stressed that Taiwan's U.N.
bid does not challenge the PRC's seat in the United Nations.
Nevertheless, it has reminded mainland Chinese leaders that their
continuous obstruction to Taiwan's participation in the
international community can only draw backlash from the people of
Taiwan and thus hamper the development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's ambassador to the United Nations, Wang Yingfan,
reiterated in an Aug. 13 letter to Annan that it was an
"indisputable objectivity and legal fact that there is only
one China," and that Taiwan was "an inseparable part of China's
territory."</P>
      <P>In his letter, Wang also rebuffed the annual attempt by a
handful of U.N. member states to raise the issue of Taiwan's bid to
join the United Nations at the General Assembly.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN SEEKS SUPPORT FOR RELAXING RESTRICTIONS ON TRADE WITH MAINLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  17  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian is scheduled to
meet some senior presidential advisers Friday evening over dinner in
an attempt to gain support for Taiwan's imminent easing of curbs on
trade with and investment in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chen is expected to aggressively seek support from several
"hardline" Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) core members for a
consensus reached by a panel under the Economic Development Advisory
Conference calling for relaxing restrictions on trade with mainland
China.</P>
      <P>The panel's consensus is evidently in line with President Chen's
announcement Tuesday that his government will phase out the "no
haste, be patient" policy of restrictions on trade with mainland
China and replace it with a policy of "positive opening and efficient
control."</P>
      <P>Chen added that before implementing the new policy, four
principles must first be enforced -- Taiwan first, global
consideration, a mutually beneficial situation, and sound risk
management.</P>
      <P>Koo Kuan-min, a senior presidential adviser who patently opposes
lifting curbs on cross-strait trade, said the government should not
only "restrain" the out-bound relocation of industries of "strategic
importance," but should also provide positive protections to those
industries to allow them to flourish in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Koo ridiculed the term "positive opening, efficient control,"
saying that it would turn out to be meaningless when supporters hope
for a positive and aggressive liberalization while opponents call for
effective and stepped-up controls.</P>
      <P>Taking Japan and the United States as examples, Koo said the two
countries, known for their long years of business and investment
expansion overseas, strictly impose restrictions on certain
industries, banning strategically-important industries from making
investments abroad in order to protect the industries' and the
nations' interests.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LIEN SAYS HE CAN MEET WITH SOONG `ANYTIME'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  17  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chairman Lien Chan of the opposition
Kuomintang said Friday that if necessary, he can meet with James
Soong, chairman of the People First Party (PFP), anytime.</P>
      <P>Lien made the comment in response to Soong's remark that he
wishes to meet with Lien as soon as possible, made one day after PFP
Secretary-General Chung Jung-chi walked out of negotiations with the
KMT on cooperation between the two opposition parties in the year-end
legislative elections, sparking speculation that the possibility of
an opposition camp alliance may be disintegrating.</P>
      <P>Chung blamed the collapse of the talks on the KMT for having "no
intention of supporting PFP members in any county." He also warned
the KMT that it will win no more than three county halls without PFP
support."</P>
      <P>Lien said that since the two parties began holding discussions
regarding year-end election cooperation, he has met with Soong almost
every one or two weeks, and "if necessary, he will meet with Soong
anytime."</P>
      <P>On the possible hurdles to KMT-PFP cooperation, KMT officials
said that the party is hoping that both sides can give up emotional
rhetoric so that bilateral negotiations do not turn into a war of
words.</P>
      <P>Lien earlier said at a commencement ceremony for a seminar of
college student group representatives that the KMT is the party that
is most concerned about the welfare of the general public.</P>
      <P>Lien lamented the fact that not enough effort has been put toward
publicizing the KMT's performance, adding that the KMT, which had
ruled Taiwan for over five decades until 2000, has contributed to the
development of Taiwan in every aspect.</P>
      <P>He said that he is baffled that some polls have shown the KMT is
not seen as the political party that is most concerned about the
people, adding that this does mean that a political party, which he
did not name, that has created a high suicide rate, unemployment rate
and crime rate during its rule is the party that is most concerned
about the people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NATURAL SCIENCE MUSEUM PRESENTING AUSTRONESIAN EXHIBITION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  17 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Museum of Natural Science in
Taichung is presenting an exhibition featuring the Austronesian
culture, while many in the academic world believe Taiwan is the
"homeland" of the Oceanic culture.</P>
      <P>Since the 1980s, international linguists and anthropologists have
made breakthroughs in their research into tracing the origin of the
Austronesian culture, with many now believing that the Austronesian
tribes first moved from the southeastern coast of the Chinese
mainland to Taiwan some five or six thousands years ago. From Taiwan,
the descendants of these people sailed to other islands, as far west
as Madagascar and as far east as the Easter Islands, according to
museum academicians.</P>
      <P>The some 150 million islanders now living in Malaysia, Indonesia,
the Philippines, Micronesia, Melanesia and Polynesia are believed to
be the descendants of these people.</P>
      <P>The research work of the linguists and anthropologists has traced
between 300 and 500 dialects spoken by present-day islanders back to
Proto-austronesian origins.</P>
      <P>The exhibition is trying to give a picture of the similarities in
various islanders' ways of living, even though diversified social
structures and customs have developed over the past several thousand
years among the Austronesian descendants living in different parts of
the world.</P>
      <P>The museum spokesman said that the exhibition is trying to
recollect the islanders' ways of living before colonization and the
effects of the intrusion of the capitalist market economy on their
societies.</P>
      <P>The exhibition will last until Feb. 28, 2002.</P>

      <P>Chang, who lost in an earlier DPP primary to Legislator Tsai

disciplinary actions and will announce her withdrawal from the party
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Although she will withdraw from the DPP, she said she will not
join any other party and will instead run as an independent, Chang
said.</P>
      <P>Chang also said that she will invite DPP heavyweights and her

    <HEADLINE>FIFTY-THREE-YEAR-OLD ADMITTED AS OLDEST FRESHMAN TO MEDICAL SCHOOL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 18 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Fifty-three-year-old Mr. Chen was recently
admitted to the National Taiwan University College of Medicine,
becoming the oldest freshman in the history of Taiwan's most
prestigious medical school.</P>
      <P>Chen in July passed the hotly contested Joint University Entrance
Examination to determine university placements -- the final time
Taiwan's educational system will hold such a test -- to become one of
the 180 government-financed freshmen admitted to the NTU medical
school for the 2001 academic year.</P>
      <P>The company owner-turned-student was the focus of attention at an
orientation program for new NTU medical school students that began
Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen oriented himself at his new school in the company of his
son, who is a fifth-year medical student at the same university.</P>
      <P>The cool younger Chen said that he does not feel "strange" that
his father will become a junior university mate of his, saying that
"my dad has the right to do whatever he chooses to do."</P>
      <P>The older Chen is expected to study at the NTU medical school for
seven years before doing his internship at public-run medical centers
for a further four years. By the time he successfully completes the
program and is ready to serve as a licensed doctor, he will already
be 64 years old, one year younger than the age that ordinary public
functionaries are eligible to retire at.</P>
      <P>Chen's "case" has raised questions about whether there should be
admission age restrictions for government-subsidized medical school
students and also whether precious educational resources should be
spent on people who are already too old to work by the time they
complete their studies.</P>
      <P>In response to such questions, Tan Kai-yuan, director of the
Bureau of Medical Affairs under the Cabinet-level Department of
Health (DOH), said the DOH has never before had someone of Chen's
advanced age become a government-subsidized medical school student,
but he added that this does not necessarily mean it is illegal or
undesirable.</P>
      <P>Tan said that Chen's success on Taiwan's difficult joint entrance
exam is confirmation of his study abilities, adding that a person of
a more senior age studying medical care for the elderly, which has
gained increasing prominence worldwide in the modern age, may have
some advantages.</P>
      <P>Lee Mao-hua, deputy director of the DOH Bureau of Medical
Affairs, said that there are no age restrictions on
government-subsidized medical school admissions and that the DOH is
not planning to impose any.</P>
      <P>"We believe that older people are equally capable of contributing
to society and the country," he added.</P>
      <P>The senior Chen defended himself against critics of admitting
older students, saying "a fair and equitable society should allow
everybody opportunities of self-challenge."</P>
      <P>"Shouldn't social and educational resources be distributed
equally to every member of society, even regardless of age?" he asked
his opponents.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that he has finally been able to fulfill his dream of
30 years by being admitted to medical school. After not receiving
placement in medical school after writing the entrance exam after
completing high school, he was instead admitted into a private
university to study business.</P>
      <P>After graduating with a degree in business, Chen ran his own
trading company, dealing in classical music records and auto parts.
He shut down his business some five years ago as a result of economic
recession.</P>
      <P>In recent years, he said, his desire to study medicine flared up
again after accompanying his son who was preparing for the joint
university entrance exam. His own exam results in the previous years
allowed him the choice of entering Tzuchi Medical University or Chung
Shan Medical and Dental College. He turned down the two choices for
the reason that they were "too far from home."</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC DEFENSE MINISTRY CHECKING U.S. NAVY EXERCISE REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) is
checking a report about a U.S. Navy exercise in the South China Sea,
military spokesman Huang Suey-sheng said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Foreign wire service reports said two U.S. aircraft carrier
battle groups have staged a rare exercise in the South China Sea in
an apparent show of support for Taiwan as mainland China is
conducting large-scale war games on its southeastern coast facing
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, the USS Carl Vinson and the USS
Constellation led Friday's one-day exercise involving 13 other
vessels, including three submarines, as well as 150 aircraft and more
than 15,000 personnel.</P>
      <P>The reports quoted an official report on the U.S. 7th Fleet's
Internet website as saying that the exercise was a "rare meeting at
sea" for the two U.S. battle groups.</P>
      <P>Asked about the MND's views on the reports, Huang said the MND is
studying the content of the reports and will closely monitor any
military exercises in relevant waters.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong-based daily the South China Morning Post quoted
defense experts as saying that the rare U.S. show of force in the
South China Sea was a pointed message to Beijing as the People's
Liberation Army (PLA) conducts large-scale war games on the
southeastern mainland coast opposite Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"There are no coincidences around the Taiwan Strait, and the
Americans would have been fully aware of the PLA exercises when they
planned this," Paul Beaver, an independent defense analyst in
Britain, was quoted as having told the Hong Kong newspaper.</P>
      <P>"They are demonstrating to the PLA that they have an interest in
the future of Taiwan," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>However, a spokesman for the U.S. 7th Fleet stressed that the
exercises were routine and not a show of force. "The exercises were
also not intended to send any `specific message' to (mainland)
China," he added.</P>
      <P>The "passing exercise" of the two U.S. aircraft carrier battle
groups was believed to have been comprised of the launching of
fighter jets and joint operations between the crews of the giant
aircraft carriers.</P>
      <P>"Along with the valuable training benefits achieved during the
exercise, the meeting of the two aircraft carrier battle groups on
the high seas demonstrates a commitment to providing peace and
cooperation in the region while preserving the right to freedom of
navigation," the 7th Fleet website report said.</P>
      <P>The website report did not give the exact location in the South
China Sea for the exercises.</P>
      <P>The USS Constellation is due to arrive in Hong Kong Monday for a
port call before making its way home to San Diego, Calif., following
a six-month deployment that included operations in the Persian Gulf.
The USS Carl Vinson, meanwhile, has just begun a six-month
deployment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSU `CAMPAIGN SCHOOL' WORKSHOP TO OPEN SUNDAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 18 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The "Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) School,"
established recently as an election campaign institute, is scheduled
to open its first two-day workshop Sunday at the Grand Hotel, TSU
sources said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Former Republic of China President and former Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Lee Teng-hui, the "spiritual father" of the
newly-established TSU party, will lecture at the workshop, said TSU
Secretary-General Su Chin-chiang.</P>
      <P>Lee and a number of other specialists in politics who are
"seasoned electioneers" will lecture at the workshop, allowing
students to pick up tips on how to win an election beginning from the
campaign trail and also how to map out campaign strategies, Su said.</P>
      <P>The students of the school, the first of its kind in Taiwan, will
be the 40-odd candidates to be fielded by the TSU in the year-end
legislative elections, as well as personnel in the newly-founded
party, according to Su.</P>
      <P>The TSU was formally established Aug. 12 as the 95th political
party in Taiwan, becoming the first political party on the island to
use "Taiwan" in its official designation.</P>
      <P>One of the top goals of the TSU is to consolidate and gain the
votes of Lee supporters, said Su, who added that TSU members have
maintained close and frequent contact with the former president and
that the TSU school will be a "stage" where cooperation between Lee
and his supporters and followers will come to the fore.</P>
      <P>Su stressed that although the TSU has just been established, it
will in a persistent "step by step" manner map out a strategy for
victory in the December elections.</P>
      <P>Lee raised the ire of KMT members last week when he said that he
wanted to form a political party to help the present minority
government of President Chen Shui-bian gain enough seats in the
year-end legislative elections to gain a stable majority.</P>
      <P>In support of Lee, Su called for the KMT camp not to disdain Lee
or his level of clout, saying that as the former president of the
Republic of China, Lee has much more influence in Taiwan society than
that of only a former chairman of a political party.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI CHINESE FOOD FAIR TO FEATURE NORTHERN DELICACIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  18  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Northern Chinese delicacies, including
feast dishes descending from the ancient Tang Dynasty, are expected
to be featured at the 2001 Taipei Chinese Food Fair slated for Aug.
23-26.</P>
      <P>Topping this year's Chinese food fair will be the Luming (Deer
Singing) Banquet, a flagship feast from Liaoning Province in
northeastern China and a reproduction of royal dishes from the Tang
Dynasty under the instruction of top Liaoning chef Liu Jingxian, who
came to Taiwan personally to demonstrate his culinary skills.</P>
      <P>The Grand Hotel, one of the 15 leading restaurants in Taipei
which will show off their gourmet attractions in their respective
pavilions during the four-day fair, dispatched seven of its major
chefs to northeastern China, exclusively to learn cooking and related
skills for the 2001 fair, said Grand Hotel General Manager Niu
Kuang-yueh.</P>
      <P>According to Niu, the Grand Hotel chefs revised the 36-course
Luming Banquet into a 20-course extravagance due to limited resources
of the ingredients needed to prepare the original one.</P>
      <P>Entrees of the Luming Banquet will be available for people
patronizing the fair which will require an admission fee of NT$250
per head.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Luming Banquet dishes, delicacies prepared
with Taiwan's native mushrooms and fungi will also be a centerpiece
of this year's fair, said officials from the China External Trade
Development Council (CETRA), which is co-sponsoring the exhibition
with the Tourism Bureau.</P>
      <P>Also expected to satisfy the appetite of Taiwan food lovers
during the fair will be nutritious traditional foods, Chinese snack
foods of all varieties, as well as northern Chinese specialties, such
as steamed buns, steamed dumplings and noodles, all displayed and
ready to serve at some 60 booths, CETRA officials added.</P>
      <P>In addition, four culinary workshops and contests will be
arranged during the fair, allowing visitors the opportunity to
demonstrate and exchange information on their own cooking skills, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Chinese Food Fair is the second most popular trade
fair in Taiwan, second only to the Taipei Computer Exhibition. It
attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors every year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW PARTY HEAVYWEIGHTS VISIT MARTYRS SHRINE IN PROTEST OF JAPAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  18  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Core members of the pro-unification
opposition New Party (NP) visited the Yuanshan Martyrs Shrine
Saturday in protest of Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's
recent visit to a controversial war memorial.</P>
      <P>More than 100 NP stalwarts, led by party convener Hsieh Chi-ta,
paid homage to the Republic of China's war dead at the shrine in
suburban Taipei. The visitors included NP public functionaries,
candidates for the year-end legislative elections and voluntary party
workers.</P>
      <P>"The shrine visit signifies our determination to take concrete
action to show our patriotism," Hsieh said, adding that the move was
also aimed at highlighting the party's protest against Koizumi's
recent visit to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, which is dedicated
to Japan's war dead, including Class A war criminals executed by the
Allies at the end of World War II.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, also an incumbent legislator, said Koizumi should not have
paid homage at the shrine as many Chinese people died as a result of
atrocities committed by Japanese war criminals to which the shrine
is partially dedicated.</P>
      <P>In an effort to prevent a revival of militarism in Japan, Hsieh
said the New Party will continue its campaign to push the Japanese
government to repent for its past mistakes and correct all the
distorted descriptions of its wartime role and atrocities in its
history textbooks for high school students.</P>
      <P>Hsieh urged people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and ethnic
Chinese around the world to boycott Japanese goods to pressure the
Japanese government to scrap the controversial history textbooks and
show remorse for Japan's wartime atrocities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAICHUNG MAYOR QUITS DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  Taiwan,  Aug.  18  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Chang Wen-ying
announced her decision to quit the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) Saturday, but she stopped short of declaring her
candidacy in the next mayoral election scheduled for Dec. 1.</P>
      <P>Chang said at a news conference that it was a painful decision
for her to quit the DPP, recalling that she had joined the opposition
camp long before the DPP was legally established.</P>
      <P>"Nobody could have imagined that I would one day leave the
erstwhile opposition and now ruling DPP," an emotional Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang, a veteran member of the DPP's Formosa faction, lost to
Tsai Ming-hsien, an incumbent legislator, in the intraparty primary
election in April. Tsai is a key figure of the New Wave faction, the
DPP's largest faction.</P>
      <P>Chang said that she was deeply disappointed by fierce factional
strife in the party primary process.</P>
      <P>"It seems to me that many DPP members have forgotten the party's
ideals and fundamental principles," she lamented.</P>
      <P>Chang said she still treasures her friendships with many of her
previous DPP associates. "I hope these friendly ties will never be
disrupted," she added.</P>
      <P>She has said on many occasions that she would not be absent from
the year-end elections for city and county government chiefs as well
as legislators.</P>
      <P>Chang is widely expected to seek a second mayoral term, but she
didn't announce her re-election bid at Saturday's news conference.
Instead, she said she will announce her final decision on which
election race she will join after completing a comprehensive review.</P>
      <P>After Chang lost to Tsai in the DPP primary, many party
heavyweights, including President Chen Shui-bian, tried persuading
Chang to run for a legislative seat in the Taichung City
constituency.</P>
      <P>However, Chang said that it is up to Taichung citizens, not her
competitor, to decide what post she should assume.</P>
      <P>Asked about her chances of success in running as an independent
in the year-end mayoral election, Chang said that over the past four
years, she has worked very hard to serve all Taichung residents
regardless of their party affiliations. "I hope to win the support of
a wide array of voters, not just a special group of voters," she
explained.</P>
      <P>Chang is expected to formally announce in the near future her
candidacy in the mayoral election as well as her campaign team
members.</P>
      <P>Two former DPP chairmen, Hsu Hsin-liang and Shih Ming-teh, were
present at the news conference to throw their support behind Chang.
Both Hsu and Shih had quit the DPP over different political concepts
and policy lines.</P>
      <P>Shih said he was disappointed by the DPP's performance since
taking power in the Republic of China's first-ever democratic
transfer of power between different political parties in May 2000.</P>
      <P>"The DPP has not acted like a ruling party. It often acts like it
is still an opposition party," Shih claimed, adding that the DPP
should change its concepts, style and strategy in order to win the
public's trust.</P>
      <P>It is widely believed that a decision by Chang to run as an
independent for the central Taiwan city's mayoral post would have a
great impact on DPP candidate Tsai Ming-hsien's mayoral bid as Chang
has enjoyed a high approval rating for her performance over the past
four years, party sources said.</P>
      <P>Some political observers said Chang's participation in the race
would also affect the main opposition Kuomintang nominee Jason Hu's
chances of success. Hu originally hoped to win Chang's support after
Chang lost the DPP primary, observers said.</P>
      <P>It remains unclear whether the opposition People First Party
(PFP) will field its own candidate for the Taichung mayoral race or
cooperate with the KMT or Chang.</P>
      <P>PFP Chairman James Soong said he will meet with KMT Chairman Lien
Chan before making a decision on whether to forge an alliance with
Chang.</P>
      <P>PFP sources said key party figures remain divided over whether
the party should cooperate with Chang. Some core members said Chang
should take the initiative in expressing an intention to forge an
alliance with the PFP.</P>
      <P>"Otherwise, the PFP can't throw its support behind Chang," said a
party heavyweight.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT DENIES REPORT THAT IT HAS TRIED BLOCKING BEIJING-TAIPEI DIALOGUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 19 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan denied Sunday
that his party has tried to block dialogue between Beijing and the
administration of President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>"It is the KMT's long-standing position that Taipei and Beijing
should resume dialogue as soon as possible on the basis of the
consensus reached between the two sides in 1992 and according to
Taipei's Guidelines for National Unification," Lien said while
administering the swearing-in of a group of party officials.</P>
      <P>He was asked to comment on a report released Friday by the U.S.
think tank the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS)
which said that members of the KMT, which was voted out of power in
2000 after five decades of rule, have asked leaders in Beijing not
to hold dialogue with the Chen administration.</P>
      <P>The CSIS cited Chinese sources as saying that KMT delegations
visiting Beijing took pains to persuade mainland leaders to not make
contact with the government in Taipei led by President Chen Shui-bian
whose pro-Taiwan independence stance has long been frowned upon by
the Chinese Communist Party.</P>
      <P>Noting that Beijing's engagement with the present Republic of
China administration would likely boost Chen's chances of reelection,
the CSIS said the delegations made up of KMT members reportedly urged
Beijing to snub Chen and await the KMT's return to power.</P>
      <P>Denouncing the CSIS's claims as "absurd", Lien said the CSIS
report's conclusions were likely due to "ignorance" and "a lack of
understanding of the situation."</P>
      <P>Beijing severed all contact with Taipei after July, 1999 when Lee
Teng-hui, the ROC president at the time, referred to the relationship
between Taiwan and mainland China as a "special state-to-state
relationship."</P>
      <P>Beijing maintained its boycott of dialogue with Taipei after Chen
was swept into power in 2000 on the grounds that Chen refused to
admit that there is only one China covering both Taiwan and mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the KMT backed down from Lee's definition of the
cross-strait relationship after he stepped down as party chairman in
March 2000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T FORECASTS TAIWAN'S 2001 PER CAPITA GNP TO DROP BELOW 1996 LEVEL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  19  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As if the worst economic growth forecast
for 2001 released Thursday by the government were not bad enough, it
has also forecast that Taiwan's per capital Gross National Product
(GNP) will dip to just below the level of five years ago, the China
Times reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>Quoting an assessment by the government's Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), the daily said Taiwan's
per capita GNP will drop by more than US$1,000 to US$13,144 for 2001.</P>
      <P>The big drop in Taiwan's per capita GNP is as unusual as the
minus 0.37 percent growth rate for 2001 predicted Thursday by the
DGBAS, according to the daily.</P>
      <P>Citing data collected by the International Monetary Fund, the
paper said Taiwan registered a per capita GNP of US$3,200 in 1984,
giving it a ranking of 31st in the world. Taiwan's per capita GNP
broke the US$10,000 mark in 1992, moving it up to 25th place
globally.</P>
      <P>That figure put the island in third place among the four
so-called "Asian tigers," lagging behind Hong Kong, whose per capita
GNP was 17th highest in the world that year, and Singapore, with the
18th highest, but well ahead of South Korea, whose per capita GNP
ranked 30th globally.</P>
      <P>Economists credited Taiwan's rapid ascendance up the global
rankings list to the island's staggering average economic growth rate
of 9 percent in the late 1980's, and also to the nearly 50 percent
appreciation in the value of the New Taiwan dollar against the
greenback.</P>
      <P>The upward trend continued into the second half of the 1990s,
with the per capita GNP hitting US$13,260 in 1996 and US$13,590 in
1997.</P>
      <P>The streak was only interrupted for one year in 1998, when the
per capita GNP dipped to US$12,360, because the Asian financial
crisis made a 9.4 percent dent in the island's exports and triggered
a 16 percent depreciation in the value of the local currency against
the U.S. dollar.</P>
      <P>Expansion resumed after 1998, with the per capita GNP surging to
US$14,188 last year, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>The government had initially predicted that Taiwan's per capita
GNP would break the US$15,000 threshold this year, but it was forced
to make a downward revision in its forecast as a result of the
worse-than-expected performance of the economy as the year
progressed.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS's latest estimation puts Taiwan's per capita GNP for
2001 at US$13,144, below the US$13,211 registered for 1996, which
will push Taiwan down two spots on the global rankings list to 27th
place, the daily said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC AIR FORCE PARTICIPATES IN U.S. AIR SHOW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  19 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung and Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Air Force officials
on Aug. 18 attended the "Wings Over Frederick Air Show" in the State
of Maryland, in which American spectators showed much interest in the
ROC Air Force flag and posters.</P>
      <P>This was the first time the ROC Air Force was represented at a
foreign air show. The reason for the invitation was that one of the
main themes of the air show was the "Flying Tigers."</P>
      <P>The "Flying Tigers" was a group of volunteer aviators organized
by then-Brig. Gen. Claire Chennault to help China combat Japanese
forces with P-40 "Warhawk" single-propeller planes in the early
stages of World War Two.</P>
      <P>After the United States entered the war in the wake of the
December 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the "Flying Tigers"
became the U.S. 14th Air Force and Chennault was officially appointed
as its commander.</P>
      <P>Chia Tse-min, the ROC Air Force Academy's dean of education who
led the ROC delegation to the air show, introduced to the American
public the development of the ROC Air Force and also the founder of
the "Flying Tigers."</P>
      <P>Chia said that the spectators' enthusiastic reaction could be
seen in the fact that all the 6,000 ROC Air Force posters, hundreds
of flags and other souvenirs handed out to spectators quickly ran out
during the two-day show. Also, two leather jackets used by "Flying
Tigers" pilots attracted much attention among the American
spectators.</P>
      <P>During the show, three former "Flying Tigers" pilots, all now in
their eighties, narrated the history of their participation in the
war against Japanese forces in mainland China and answered
spectators' questions.</P>
      <P>The organizer of the air show also exhibited a P-40
single-propeller plane used by the "Flying Tigers" as well as other
military planes used by the air forces of the United States and the
former Soviet Union during World War II.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXPANSION PLANNED FOR KAOHSIUNG INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  19 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In a bid to promote Kaohsiung to become a
global business operations center, the central government will invest
between NT$3 billion and NT$4 billion in a "twin-port" plan for the
southern Taiwan city by expanding its international airport, a
government official was quoted by the China Times Express as saying
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Ho Mei-yueh, vice chair of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD), said the CEPD will handle the case
proposed by the Kaohsiung city government by first lengthening the
runways at Kaohsiung International Airport in an effort to
facilitate the landing and taking off of large air cargo planes.</P>
      <P>The CEPD's decision came after the government's offshore
transshipment center in Kaohsiung, Taiwan's largest port city, kicked
off its air-sea transshipment operations Saturday for products from
mainland China headed for a third destination.</P>
      <P>Under the cooperation agreement between China Airlines and
Yangming Marine Transport Corp., Kaohsiung port and Kaohsiung
International Airport started their first-ever joint operations by
transshipping products from Xiamen in mainland China's Fujian
province to Philadelphia in the United States in only two days, 10
days shorter than the normal shipping time by sea.</P>
      <P>As the current runways at Kaohsiung International Airport are too
short for large airplanes such as Boeing 747s to use, Ho said the
CEPD will first improve its runway facilities in line with its
"twin-port" plan in a move to develop Kaohsiung into a global
business operations center.</P>
      <P>Completion of the planned construction and expansion projects at
the airport is expected to attract greater investment by transport
businesses and international couriers, such as UPS and DHL, giving a
boost both to the airport's operations and the city's offshore
transshipment center.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the joint air-sea transport operations launched at
the Kaohsiung offshore transshipment center will also shorten the
travel time for high-tech products made by Taiwan firms based in
mainland China's Shenzhen, Dongguan, Zhongshan, as well as those
locally-made goods at the nearby Luchu and Tainan science-based
industrial parks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-MADE DIGITAL CAMERA PRODUCTION VOLUME FORECAST TO HIT 6.8 M</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  19  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The production volume of Taiwan-made
digital cameras is expected to increase to 6.8 million in 2001 from
4.27 million in 2000, giving the locally-made goods a 34 percent
global market share, the Photonics Industry and Technology
Development Association forecast Sunday.</P>
      <P>The association said that it has revised downward its earlier
digital-camera production volume forecast of 7.27 million as a result
of the global economic slowdown but that it has maintained its
forecast regarding the product's world market share.</P>
      <P>It predicted that the global production volume for digital
cameras will rise to more than 20 million for this year, a 50 percent
increase over the 2000 level.</P>
      <P>Attributing the large increase in production volume last year to
the combination of the hi-tech product with the Internet as well as
to greater demand resulting from falling prices, Yeh Teh-chuan,
chairman of the association, claimed that the local digital-camera
makers' prospects are bright so long as they further strengthen
their research and development capabilities and seek more outsourcing
opportunities from large international companies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC FACT-FINDING GROUP HEADS TO XIAMEN TO EXPEDITE CROSS-STRAIT TRADE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Aug.  20  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A fact-finding Taiwan team comprised of
officials from Cabinet-level agencies and the Kinmen government left
for mainland China's Xiamen City Monday on a investigative tour aimed
at facilitating direct trade links across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Members of the group, including 11 officials from the Republic of
China's Finance Ministry and Economic Affairs Ministry as well as
from the Council of Agriculture and the Department of Health, along
with officials from Kinmen's Reconstruction Bureau and Tourism
Bureau, sailed aboard the Kinmen-based ferry "Taiwu" directly from
Kinmen's Liaoluo Port to Xiamen.</P>
      <P>The group members are scheduled to spend five days in Xiamen
familiarizing themselves with the situation regarding cross-strait
customs regulations, produce and animal quarantine inspections, and
other related matters.</P>
      <P>The group's visit to Xiamen is also considered a path clearer,
paving the way for Fujian Province's consumer products companies to
stage the first-ever mainland Chinese trade exposition in Kinmen.</P>
      <P>If the proposed trade expo, to be co-sponsored by Kinmen's
Business and Trade Association and the trade authority from Fujian
Province's Jinjiang City, is successfully held in Kinmen, it will
mark the first legal direct imports of mainland Chinese consumer
products to Kinmen since the ROC government inaugurated the "mini
three links" at the start of this year.</P>
      <P>The "mini three links" refers to direct trade, postal, and
shipping links between the ROC's frontline islands of Kinmen and
Matsu and mainland China's port cities of Xiamen and Mawei.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu Chun-min, chairman of the Kinmen Business and
Trade Association, people from the two sides have indeed been
exchanging visits since the "mini three links" policy went into
effect, but legal direct trade, except for a couple of mainland
Chinese gravel shipments to Kinmen, has not occurred due to rigid
controls by authorities on both sides.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has up to the present time refused to allow
across-the-board regular direct Kinmen-Xiamen shipping services and
has instead approved such applications on a case-be-case basis.</P>
      <P>Ironically, illicit "petty trade" among fishermen between Kinmen
and Xiamen, located jut 2.4 kilometers apart, has become rampant
despite Taiwan's implementation of the "mini three links," which were
designed to turn illegal trade activities legal, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>If the proposed "Jinjiang Trade Expo" slated for Aug. 30-Sept. 2
successfully takes place, it will serve as a catalyst, expediting
legal imports of mainland Chinese consumer goods, including
foodstuffs, garments, umbrellas, hardware, building materials,
electronics and toys to the ROC offshore areas, Hsu continued.</P>
      <P>He added that the ice-breaking expo is also expected to be a shot
in the arm for Kinmen's sluggish economy, which has so far not
witnessed any benefits from the opening of the "mini three links."</P>
      <P>Wang Yuandong, deputy mayor of Jinjiang City, will lead a
185-member trade delegation to Kinmen in late August to beef up
publicity of the proposed "Jinjiang Trade Expo," according to Hsu.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN CHRISTIANS COMPLETE WORLD'S 1ST HANDWRITTEN CHINESE BIBLE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 6,000 Christians in Taiwan have
jointly completed the world's first handwritten Chinese Bible to mark
the advent of the new millennium.</P>
      <P>The drive to create a handwritten Chinese-language Bible was
launched by the Bible Society in the Republic of China last
September, with the handwriting portion of the task being completed
in May this year.</P>
      <P>The society then spent three more months compiling and arranging
the handwritten manuscript which weighs a total of 34.5 kilograms.
The manuscript was compiled into seven volumes.</P>
      <P>The society displayed the seven-volume Bible for the first time
Sunday in a ceremony held at the Shuanglien Presbyterian Church in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>ROC Bible Society Chairman Weng Hsiu-kung, a Christian pastor,
said it is a blessing to be able to record God's words by hand. In
ancient times, people wrote the Bible word by word. With the
development of printing technology, Christians can now easily read
the Bible.</P>
      <P>"We launched the `writing the Bible by hand' campaign in the new
millennium mainly to let today's Christians understand the hardships
and contributions of their predecessors," Weng said, adding that it
is also expected to remind the participants to respect God's words.</P>
      <P>According to Weng, the handwriting drive started with former ROC
President Lee Teng-hui and his wife Tseng Wen-hui, both devout
Christians, handwriting the first three verses of the first chapter
of the book of Genesis.</P>
      <P>A total of 150 local Christian churches, organizations and
schools then mobilized their staff and rank-and-file members to write
the remaining parts of the Bible. Each contributor was required to
present two copies of the section he or she had written. As a result,
two copies of the handwritten Chinese Bible were completed.</P>
      <P>Weng said that one copy will be sent to the Bible Society in the
United States for permanent display and that the original copy will
be kept at the ROC Bible Society.</P>
      <P>"The different handwriting styles of the 6,000-plus contributors
symbolize that despite their individuality, all Christians share a
common belief in God," Weng explained.</P>
      <P>He further said that each participant has donated at least NT$100
(US$2.90) for each section he or she has written, including the
former ROC first couple.</P>
      <P>"As a result, we have collected NT$2.6 million in cash donations.
The fund will be used to produce special versions of the Bible for
the blind, various aboriginal tribes and other local ethnic groups,"
Weng added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T URGED TO OPEN DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT LINKS TO REV UP ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  20  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wary of Taiwan's worsening economic
downturn, several scholars at leading Taiwan universities on Monday
urged the government to take pragmatic measures to help prop up the
floundering economy.</P>
      <P>Prof. Lin Tsu-chia from National Chengchi University suggested
that at a time when the country is facing unprecedented economic
distress, the government should adopt aggressive measures, such as
opening direct trade, travel and communications links with mainland
China, to stimulate the sluggish economy.</P>
      <P>Other active and clear-cut measures, including allowing Taiwan
financial institutions to branch out to mainland China and letting
mainland Chinese professionals come to Taiwan to work, should also be
taken to help strengthen cross-strait fund interflows and to
facilitate business and trade activities, Lin added.</P>
      <P>Prof. Lin Chien-fu from National Taiwan University called for the
administration of President Chen Shui-bian not to just wrestle with
monetary policies and instead expend more mental energy on mapping
out pragmatic and useful measures to help Taiwan out of its current
economic quagmire.</P>
      <P>Prof. Hsu Chen-ming, also from National Taiwan University,
criticized Premier Chang Chun-hsiung and the ministers of finance and
economic affairs for continuing to paint a rosy picture about
Taiwan's economic prospects while major economic forecasters abroad
are indicating that Taiwan's economy is expected to post negative
growth this year.</P>
      <P>All the statements made by Cabinet officials on the island's
"not-so-bad" economic prospects were smashed last week when the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS)
publicized its forecast estimating that Taiwan's economy will post a
minus 0.37 percent growth rate for this year. This would represent
the island's first-ever, full-year negative growth rate.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS's forecast comes after Taiwan's economy posted negative
2.35 percent growth for this year's second quarter.</P>
      <P>Hsu also suggested that the Chen administration move to
accelerate cross-strait business and trade exchanges, saying that
Taiwan should take advantage of the opportunities presented by
mainland China's strongly-performing economy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN DECORATES OUTGOING U.S. ENVOY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The outgoing de-facto U.S. ambassador to
the Republic of China received a decoration Monday from the ROC
government for his contribution to promoting substantive
Taipei-Washington relations.</P>
      <P>In a ceremony held at the Presidential Office, President Chen
Shui-bian decorated Raymond Burghardt, director of the Taipei Office
of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), with the Order of
Brilliant Star with Grand Cordon, which symbolizes the highest honor
the ROC presents to a foreign national.</P>
      <P>President Chen said when he made a historic transit stop in New
York in May, AIT Chairman Richard Bush told him that ROC-U.S.
relations are now in better shape than ever.</P>
      <P>"Progress in ROC-U.S. relations is the result of concerted
efforts by many people, but I think that Burghardt has played a very
important role in leading the AIT Taipei Office to help upgrade
bilateral ties between our two countries," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taipei-Washington communication channels have been
working smoothly, Chen said the two countries have forged a strong
mutual trust over the past years. "I'm hopeful that our substantive
relationship will continue to grow in the future," he added.</P>
      <P>For his part, Burghardt, who has been appointed new U.S.
ambassador to Vietnam, said he appreciates the ROC government's
recognition of his work.</P>
      <P>Burghardt said he has seen for himself the people of Taiwan's
diligence and can-do spirit during his two-year service. "I have come
to learn that Taiwan is an admirable place," Burghardt said, adding
that his Taipei stint has also enabled him to better understand the
people of Taiwan's frustration as some people in the world have not
given them the due respect they deserve.</P>
      <P>Burghardt went on to say that relations between the United States
and Taiwan are extraordinary. Despite the absence of formal
diplomatic ties, he said, the two sides have maintained a very close
and important relationship. Burghardt said so long as both sides
abide by their commitments, Taiwan-U.S. relations will further expand
in the future.</P>
      <P>During his tenure, both the ROC and the United States have
undergone transitions of power between different political parties.
In the process, Burghardt said, both sides can weather all
difficulties and continue strengthening their relationship. In his
view, Burghardt said these achievements should be attributed in part
to President Chen's open-mindedness and friendly attitude.</P>
      <P>Noting that few people have the opportunity to contribute to
maintaining regional peace and stability, Burghardt said he feels
honored to have the opportunity to carry out what he believes to be
the right choice during his two-year service in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>AIT is a quasi-official U.S. organization authorized to handle
ROC-U.S. relations in the absence of official ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HAPPY BLOOD DONOR GIVES MORE THAN 100,000CC IN 18 YEARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A blood donor in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan,
has been donating blood for 18 consecutive years to help people in
need, sources from the Taipei Blood Center said Monday.</P>
      <P>During the past two years, Chiu Hsin-chih, a 44-year-old resident
of Pahteh City, Taoyuan County, has become even more enthusiastic
about his blood donation by bicycling from his hometown to Taipei to
give blood, saying that long-distance bicycling makes him a happier
and more efficient donor.</P>
      <P>Since early 1999, Chiu has regularly ridden his bicycle from
Pahteh to the Taipei Blood Center in downtown Taipei twice a month to
give blood and returned, also on his bicycle, riding an approximate
50 kilometers for the round-trip journey each time.</P>
      <P>"Bicycle riding is a good sport and it helps pump the blood," a
healthy container truck driver Chiu said.</P>
      <P>Chiu said he had never thought that his first blood donation
under the "connivance" of his pals from the military in 1983 would
develop into a habit which has continued for 18 years.</P>
      <P>According to records from the Taoyuan Blood Center, where he gave
blood before 1999, and the Taipei Blood Center, Chiu has given more
than 100,000cc of blood over the past 18 years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLAR CAUTIONS OF AFTEREFFECTS OF MONETARY CONSOLIDATION ACTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  20 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Professor Norman Yin of National Chengchi
University said Monday that the first-wave actions of the "Monetary
Reconstruction Fund" task force to consolidate the operations of
local banks have been carried out smoothly, but the authorities
should be cautious of possible aftereffects.</P>
      <P>On Aug. 10, without pre-warnings, the task force personnel were
assigned to 36 local financial institutions, mostly credit
departments of farmers and fishermen's associations, to supervise
their operations. The net assets of all of these 36 local financial
institutions are presently in the red.</P>
      <P>Prof. Yin said that the sweeping actions did not cause a crisis
of confidence because of the backing of the NT$140 billion fund and
the authorities' full guarantee of customers' rights.</P>
      <P>However, the professor said that the authorities should be
extremely careful with follow-up work. While the "Monetary
Reconstruction Fund" promises to take care of the bad debts of the
problem financial institutions, there is still the risk that the
executives of some of these faltering institutions will take
advantage of the trouble-shooting measures and clear out the assets,
he noted.</P>
      <P>Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang has warned that the task force
personnel will put any of the local bank or farmers associations'
credit departments under supervision if irregularities are found in
their financial status or operations.</P>
      <P>The "Monetary Reconstruction Fund" was set up in July to help
solve the financial problems of Taiwan's financial institutions. Most
of the local financial institutions affiliated with farmers or
fishermen's associations are small in scale and lack transparency.
These financial institutions are not expected to be able to face the
challenge when Taiwan opens its financial services market.</P>
      <P>The authorities expect that the "Monetary Reconstruction Fund"
may help these financial institutions make a safe exit from the
market.</P>

      <P>The success of the "International Children's
Festival" has encouraged the sponsor of the event -- the Ilan County
Government -- to develop a permanent children's park in this
northeastern coastal county famous for its natural beauty and hot
springs.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Ilan County Government said Monday that the
44-day children's festival which concluded on Aug. 19 attracted
800,000 visitors. In addition to revenues from admissions, income
received by travel, hotel, restaurant and souvenir businesses are
estimated to have reached NT$1 billion this year.</P>
      <P>The Ilan County Government sponsored the first International
Children's Festival six years ago. Except for 1999, the event has
been held annually during summer vacation.</P>
      <P>"Close to water and embraced by green" was the theme of the
festival this year. In recent years, the sponsor had invited artistic
groups from all over the world to perform folk music, dances and
shows for children. This year, performances by 22 artistic groups
from Asia, Europe, Africa, Latin America and Oceania added an exotic
touch to the summer events.</P>
      <P>While the five festivals in the past six years have become ever
more popular among children, the Ilan County Government has decided
to develop the festival venue, Chingshui Park, into a permanent
children's park, said the spokesman.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan exported only 2.05 million boxes of
bananas to Japan from March to June, the lowest level in history, the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>During February to April, all Taiwan exports of bananas to Japan
reached only 50 percent of original targets and the 2.05 million
boxes was also well below the target of 3.5 million boxes set earlier
by relevant authorities, COA officials said, adding that the price
per box also dropped from US$11 in 2000 to the present US$9.45.</P>
      <P>Hsu Fu-kun, general manager of Taiwan Fruit and Vegetable
Cooperative Association, attributed the falls to Japan's removal of
preferential customs duties on Taiwan bananas and strong competition
from mainland China and the Philippines. He noted that the

to try to secure an additional order of 500,000 boxes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EX-DPP CHAIR ADVOCATES 'NEUTRALIZATION' OF TAIWAN STRAIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An estranged former chairman of the
Republic of China's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
advocated neutralization of the Taiwan Strait Monday for the sake of
regional peace and stability.</P>
      <P>Shih Ming-teh, an incumbent legislator who quit the DPP over
differences in political concepts and policy lines, made the
suggestion at a seminar on East Asian security and strategy.</P>
      <P>Shih said the present status quo on the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait must be maintained. "Otherwise, peace will be lost in the
Taiwan Strait and the national interests of both Taiwan and Japan
would be affected," he noted.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Shih said he looks forward to seeing the
Taiwan Strait neutralized. "I hope that all Asia-Pacific countries
will sign a joint declaration pushing to open the Taiwan Strait to
all countries around the world in line with the United Nations
convention on the open sea," he added.</P>
      <P>The outspoken lawmaker further said relevant Asia-Pacific
countries should sign a multilateral treaty or agreement on
designating special regions where deployment of troops and weaponry
systems would be prohibited. "Only by doing this can we maintain
regional peace and stability," Shih stressed.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Lien Chan, chairman of Taiwan's
main opposition Kuomintang, said Asia remains an area with potential
threats of conflict.</P>
      <P>In his view, Lien said, top leaders on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait should work together to end their disputes and avert war and
conflict. "Otherwise, all East Asian countries could be affected by a
cross-strait conflict," Lien said, adding that Asia's peace and
security lies in promotion of common interests of all Asian
countries, including mainland China.</P>
      <P>The one-day seminar was sponsored by a Japanese think tank
dedicated to research of current international and regional issues
and trends. This was the first time that the Japanese
World Events Study Association has organized a symposium in Taipei.
Twenty-four Japanese parliamentarians and scores of representatives
from Japanese journalistic, academic and business circles traveled to
Taipei to attend the seminar.</P>
      <P>Takanori Nakajo, a senior executive with the Japanese think tank,
said in his opening remarks that Japan's current security system
centers around its defense cooperation treaty with the United States.
As Japan's security is closely related to Asian peace, Nakajo said
the U.S.-Japanese security cooperation system should be updated and
expanded to cover issues crucial to peace and stability in the entire
Asian region.</P>
      <P>Eimei Kase, a Japanese diplomatic commentator, said mainalnd
China is the only country that has continued to expand its military
buildup after the end of the Cold War.</P>
      <P>At present, Kase said, Taiwan, Japan and the United States are
the main targets of mainland China's missile deployment. As mainland
China tends to consider democratic countries as its enemies, Taiwan
and Japan should cooperate in fighting against mainland China's
military expansionism to maintain peace and stability in Asia.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The press report of the possible
replacement of Premier Chang Chun-hsiung is completely unfounded and
sheer speculation, a senior Presidential Office spokesman said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Yu Shyi-kun, secretary-general to the president, was responding
to a newspaper report that President Chen Shui-bian had asked his
senior advisers and some business tycoons about the feasibility of
replacing Premier Chang with a more capable politician to revitalize
Taiwan's faltering economy.</P>
      <P>Yu said the president was infuriated by the report. "President
Chen said the report was fictitious and unthinkable," Yu said, adding
that Chen had ordered him to make a public clarification of the
report.</P>
      <P>Yu said the report was purely fabricated. "We feel deep regret
over the appearance of such a report on the front page of a local
newspaper," he added.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Chen took advantage of a dinner with
several senior advisers and national policy advisers last Friday to
seek their opinions about the feasibility of replacing Premier Chang
before or after the year-end elections for legislators and local
government chiefs.</P>
      <P>The report further said Chen had also met with senior commerce
and industry executives to solicit their views on the premier
replacement issue.</P>
      <P>However, Yu debunked all those allegations, saying that Premier
Chang was present at last Friday's dinner party at President Chen's
official residence.</P>
      <P>"How could Chen have talked about any possible personnel change
topics at such an occasion?" Yu asked, adding that he himself was
also present at the time. "Nobody mentioned the word 'premier' during
the dinner party," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Yu said that several business heavyweights asked to meet Chen
last week to discuss some issues related to the soon-to-be-convened
Economic Development Advisory Conference.</P>
      <P>"As the president's schedule was fully booked, he asked me to
meet with the business leaders on his behalf. Our talks surrounded
issues related to the conference and no one said anything about a
change in personnel," Yu said.</P>
      <P>During this time of economic hardship, Yu said local people all
hope that the public and private sectors will work together to
address various problems to revamp the domestic economy.</P>
      <P>"We hope never again to see this kind of irresponsible press
report," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT SPOKESMAN SHIES AWAY FROM JUDGING FORMER CHIEF'S WORDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  20  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Kuomintang spokesman brushed aside
questions Monday about whether the party's former chairman, Lee
Teng-hui, has betrayed the party by identifying himself with the
cause of the newly formed Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU).</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Wang Chih-kang said that whether Lee's remarks have
crossed the line from simple public speaking to words that are in
violation of party rules should be judged by the KMT disciplinary
committee.</P>
      <P>Wang said he is in no position to pass judgment on Lee's behavior
before the disciplinary committee deliberates on the matter.</P>
      <P>Wang was asked to comment on Lee's remarks to a group of aspiring
TSU candidates Monday where the former president said that he
identified himself with the TSU's political mission and hoped that
the newly formed political movement would become a major force in the
year-end elections.</P>
      <P>Lee, who was invited to speak about politics to TSU candidates,
said that only a victory by the TSU would ensure that the island
becomes politically stable. A good showing in the year-end elections
would bring the nation out of its economic malaise and reinforce
democracy, he said.</P>
      <P>The retired KMT chairman also defended his decision of not
washing his hands of politics after stepping down, saying that he,
like an old father, cannot stand by and watch his two feuding sons
make a mess of the house.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT legislator Hung Hsing-rong urged Lee Monday to
quit the KMT and pitch for the TSU rather than sit on the fence and
keep the KMT, the TSU and even the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
in agony.</P>
      <P>Hung made the suggestion after the TSU on Monday reputed
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng's claims that Lee will stump
for KMT candidates during the elections, despite his public
endorsement of the TSU.</P>
      <P>TSU members said Wang, who has been Lee's political crony in the
KMT, misquoted Lee's statement.</P>
      <P>Citing two former DPP chiefs who have defected from the party as
an example, Hung said it is not unusual in Taiwan for politicians to
switch their political allegiances.</P>
      <P>Lee should declare his withdrawal from the KMT to spare the party
the embarrassment of seeing its former chief pitching for
competitors, Hung said.</P>
      <P>Another KMT legislator and a supporter of Lee, Chen Horng-chi,
said Lee didn't lend his support to the TSU, instead it was the TSU
which attached itself to Lee in the hopes of riding on Lee's
coattails.</P>
      <P>As Lee's status as the former head of the KMT cannot be changed,
the KMT could better use its energy by formulating a vote-earning
policy rather than wracking its brain on how to cope with Lee's
behavior, Chen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER PRESIDENT HOPES TSU IS VICTORIOUS IN YEAR-END ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  20  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui on Monday expressed his hope that the newly established
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) will become a major party after the
year-end legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks during a speech he gave to the TSU on
election strategies and practices.</P>
      <P>The former ROC president said his political ideals are similar to
that of the TSU -- to pursue the goal of a stable political
environment in Taiwan, a revived economy, a solid democracy and a
strong Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He indicated that the TSU must become a major party after the
year-end legislative and county chiefs elections so that it can
implement its political policies and so that Taiwan can progress.</P>
      <P>Lee said that although he has not officially joined the TSU, he
"spiritually" supports the new party, which was organized by former
Minister of the Interior Huang Chu-wen.</P>
      <P>Concerning the criticism that the retired Lee does not want to
give up his political influence, Lee noted that he is still involved
not because of his need for power, but because he was upset by
Taiwan's chaotic political situation and faltering economy.</P>
      <P>He emphasized that he will feel comfortable if Taiwan can
establish a consolidated democracy now, considering that he will not
live more than another 10 years. Lee said he cannot sit idly by while
the democratization that he advocated during his 12-year tenure of
office nears collapse.</P>
      <P>The 78-year-old Lee, who has been dubbed "Mr. Democracy" of
Taiwan, said that he hopes TSU will bring to fruition what he failed
to accomplish during his 12-year tenure. This can only be done if the
TSU becomes a leading party, Lee added.</P>
      <P>Lee also explained his past achievements of pushing for the
return of the military from political parties to the people,
de-linking political parties from the government, and restructuring
the congress.</P>
      <P>Other lecturers for Monday's event included Huang Chu-wen, who
spoke on "Strategies to Win," and Wu Hsiang-hui, an election expert,
who gave an analysis on the past 10 biggest elections and on election
practices.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONTRACTION IN GOVERNMENT, PRIVATE SPENDING SAID HARMFUL TO ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  20  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The negative economic growth rate in the
second quarter, coupled with a contraction in both government
spending and private consumption are all to blame for Taiwan's
present economic problems, a government official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Council for Economic Planning and Development Vice Chairman
(CEPD) Lee Kao-chao said the sharp decline in private consumption,
together with falls in government spending, are very harmful to
business sentiments and will hamper the recovery of the local
economy.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, investment in public works by the government
and state-run enterprises dropped by 0.39 percent and 8.63 percent,
respectively, in the second quarter, while government spending also
slid by 0.96 percent during the same period.</P>
      <P>Lee added, however, that the Central Bank of China's (CBC's)
loose monetary policy will help improve the local financial
situation. The CBC's cuts in major interest rates since late last
year will gradually show their effects, he added, attributing the
rise of the money supply levels in May and June to the CBC's series
of adjustments.</P>
      <P>The CBC announced the year's eighth lowering of interest rates
last week.</P>
      <P>As to proposals by members of the local business community that
the government slash its stock transaction tax, land value increment
tax and sales tax, Lee said any such proposed tax reductions should
be accompanied by "complementary measures."</P>
      <P>Lee also predicted that Taiwan's economy will bottom out in the
third quarter and begin to improve in the fourth quarter, based on
the fact that the U.S. economy is gradually regaining its momentum.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's unemployment rate for the whole of
2001 will remain above 4.1 percent, an official with the
Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD)
forecast Monday.</P>
      <P>CEPD Vice Chairman Lee Kao-chao said given the fact that the
average jobless rate in the first half of the year averaged 3.94
percent and that the ratio for the next three months is expected to
surpass 5 percent, the country's annual unemployment is expected to
hit a record high of more than 4.1 percent.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, Taiwan's jobless rate will rise between 0.5
percentage points and 0.7 percentage points with every 1 percentage
point by which the economy shrinks. As the country's economy posted
negative growth in the second quarter and is expected to also post
negative growth in the third quarter, he said it will be unlikely
that the jobless rate -- a lagging index of business sentiment -- to
diminish in the short term.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a prediction that Taiwan's unemployment rate will
fall below 4.2 percent in September, Lee called the viewpoint "too
optimistic," claiming that the ratio will not fall below the level by
the end of this year and will remain relatively high for the next
year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA PLANNING TO BUILD TAIWAN INTO HIGH VALUE-ADDED CENTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 20 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics Minister Lin Hsin-yi said Monday
that the Ministry of Economic Affairs is planning to transform Taiwan
into a highly value-added product manufacturing center "within the
next five years."</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference, Lin said that the market and
resources of mainland China should be incorporated as a link in
Taiwan's industrial global deployment.</P>
      <P>Facing the crisis of the hollowing out of local industry, capital
and talent, Taiwan should adopt a new vision for its national
economic development, Lin said.</P>
      <P>He presented a farsighted policy of internationalizing Taiwan's
economic position, stressing that national security is still the
highest value for the nation, but adding that Taiwan should adopt a
new security vision to replace the conservative "security defense
viewpoint."</P>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Yiin Chii-ming said that Taiwan is facing
its biggest crises of industry, capital and talent since Taiwan
businessmen began poured their capital investment into mainland
China. He further said that Taiwan has lost the opportunity to play a
"strategic position" role.</P>
      <P>The ministry's new "economic blueprint" will aim at building
Taiwan into a high value-added production center in the coming five
years, making it one of the three largest bonded air and sea
transshipment hubs in Asia, Yiin said, without elaborating.</P>
      <P>Lin pointed out that the government can no longer maintain its
"do it all" attitude but should adopt a "lean but efficient" concept.
The MOEA should play a pivotal role in the process of this economic
development, he said.</P>
      <P>The MOEA will push for an upgrading of technology and
competitiveness while "pulling" more foreign investment and reviewing
all the outdated regulations and laws to upgrade administrative
efficiency, he added.</P>
      <P>The MOEA will also complete the work of six support systems to
support the high value-added manufacturing center idea, he said,
describing these systems as the implementation of a new research and
development system; the development of the island as a bonded
transshipment hub; the development of a mechanism for venture
businesses; the establishment of an online supply chain
administrative process; the pooling of capital mechanism for the high
tech industry; and the setting up of an improved financial service
system.</P>

      <P>Chinese Taipei's Chen Kuan-ting won a
silver medal Monday in the lightweight powerlifting at the Sixth
World Games presently under way in Akita City, Japan.</P>
      <P>It was the second silver won by the Chinese Taipei delegation

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN RESONATES IN CHINESE, AMERICAN PSYCHES: CANADIAN EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, Aug. 20 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is like no other issue; it resonates
"deeply in both the Chinese and American psyches," a Canadian expert
claimed Monday.</P>
      <P>According to Thomas Axworthy, chairman of the Asia Pacific
Foundation of Canada, how both countries handle the future of Taiwan
"will be one of the pre-eminent issues of the 21st century."</P>
      <P>"If miscalculations are made, conflict will be inevitable and
then Taiwan will become an ultimate concern of us all," he warned in
an article he contributed to The Globe and Mail, a Canadian daily.</P>
      <P>Titled "Taiwan is the Tinder in Asian-American Relations," his
article points out that there is no doubt that the mainland Chinese
leadership is "visibly apprehensive" about the possibility of Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>During a recent academic discussion in Hong Kong in which he
participated, Axworthy witnessed the mainland Chinese expressing
their concern over the need for stability.</P>
      <P>"The Chinese nightmare is disintegration and Taiwanese
independence is viewed as a precursor to the breakup of China
itself," he said.</P>
      <P>"My American colleagues, on the other hand, rightly applauded the
democratic transformation of Taiwan and view it not as a rebel state,
but as a beacon of freedom," said Axworthy, who is also adjunct
lecturer on public policy at Harvard University.</P>
      <P>For each side of the debate, he noted, Taiwan is a symbol of
something much deeper -- in fact, "representative of each country's
ultimate concern."</P>
      <P>For mainland China, introverted, proud and only recently emerged
from a century of civil war and cultural revolution, the ultimate
concern is territorial integrity, Axworthy said.</P>
      <P>For the United States, extrovert and in the high noon of its
influence, there are no threats to territorial integrity. The
ultimate American value is liberty and the promotion of the American
way around the globe, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO DECIDE FATE OF ITS RESEARCH REACTOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  20  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A panel under the Atomic Energy Council
(AEC) will meet Tuesday to decide whether to go ahead with the
rebuilding of Taiwan's Research Reactor II (TRR II).</P>
      <P>The panel, made up of Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh and
five other experts, is reportedly to choose between going ahead with
the initial rebuilding plan or suspending it for three years.</P>
      <P>The China Times, a local daily, said Monday that the panel is
expected to choose suspension of the reconstruction of the reactor,
which would be tantamount to phasing out the whole plan, since the
prospects of a resumption after three years are slim in light of the
government's tight budget.</P>
      <P>The paper said the panel based its decision on the grounds that
new technology has made the planned rector obsolete even before it
has been built.</P>
      <P>In addition, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
anti-nuclear stance is surely a factor contributing to the
abolishment of the reactor, said the paper.</P>
      <P>AEC Vice Chairman Ouyang Min-sheng said Monday that any panel
decision will be subject to the approval of the National Science
Council and the ratification of the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Ouyang said that even if the panel decides to suspend the
construction of the new reactor, the budget earmarked for it -- NT$38
million (US$1.11 million) for this year -- will be used to dismantle
the old reactor or to finance the research into energy and
environmental protection science.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan research reactor, purchased from Canada in 1969 for
scientific research, was forced to shut down by Washington in 1988
after it was found to have being used secretly for military purposes.</P>
      <P>The Institute of Nuclear Energy Research under the AEC came up
with the TRR II plan in 1990 to improve the reactor rather than
demolish it.</P>
      <P>The plan, which went through the National Science Council in 1998
and was approved by the Executive Yuan in the same year, envisioned
the reconstruction of the reactor in seven years at a cost of NT$3.28
billion.</P>
      <P>The China Times said a three-year interruption in the research
into nuclear energy will be another blow to the island's nuclear
industry after the government's flip-flop on the construction of a
controversial nuclear plant last year.</P>
      <P>It will also obstruct the replenishment of Taiwan's aging nuclear
researchers who, numbered at about a thousand, have an average age of
47, according to the China Times.</P>

Po-ya, traveling at the head of a 20-member delegation, arrived in
Beijing Monday to attend the 2001 Women's Leaders Meeting under the
framework of the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.</P>
      <P>Despite Beijing's identification of her as "Ms. Chang" on her

with "VIP" treatment at the airport.</P>
      <P>This is Chang's first visit to mainland China, although she had
promoted the passage of the Statute Governing the Relations between
the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area" when she was a
legislator.</P>
      <P>Restricted by her status as the director-general of the National
Health Department and then the Minister of the Interior, she was
unable to have a chance to visit the mainland for the past several

      <P>Chang said that her participation in the 2001 Women's Leaders
Meeting under the sponsorship of APEC -- a warm-up for the APEC
Ministerial Women's meeting scheduled to be held in Mexico next year
-- is chiefly to exchange views with other Asian women's leaders.</P>
      <P>Although Beijing called her as "Ms. Chang" in its invitation

purposes gave her the honorific of "minister."</P>
      <P>The 2001 Women's Leaders Meeting will open in Beijing Wednesday

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu denied Monday
there has been any tiff between her and President Chen Shui-bian or
former President Lee Teng-hui over their snubbing of her "peace
assembly" last week.</P>
      <P>In a press release issued through her office, Lu said that
although Chen and Lee were "unable" to attend the "Voice from Taiwan:
Peace and Love" event from Aug. 13-16, they received the foreign
dignitaries who attended, including five Nobel Peace prize laureates.</P>
      <P>Lu expressed thanks to Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for their assistance in
organizing the event, as well as to a dozen civic groups for their
sponsorship.</P>
      <P>The vice president, whose advocacy of mass Taiwanese immigration
to Belize caused an uproar in that Caribbean state recently, also
said in a belated attempt at damage control that her statement was
aimed at urging the government to formulate a long-term immigration
policy rather than overwhelming the Caribbean state with Taiwan
immigrants.</P>
      <P>She also disputed local press reports that she competed for the

    <HEADLINE>ROC PREMIER DESCRIBES TRANSIT VIA U.S. AS `DIPLOMATIC BREAKTHROUGH'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  20  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung claimed Monday
that stopovers he plans to make in four U.S. cities en route to four
of the Republic of China's diplomatic allies in the Caribbean can be
considered a "diplomatic breakthrough."</P>
      <P>Chang will make an official 12-day visit to the four diplomatic
allies -- St. Christopher and Nevis, St. Vincent and the Grenadines,
the Commonwealth of Dominica and Grenada -- from Sept. 1.</P>
      <P>Chang and his entourage will make transit stops in New York
Miami, Los Angeles and Hawaii on their way to and from the Caribbean
visit.</P>
      <P>According to the ROC Foreign Ministry, one of the main purposes
of the visit is to attend activities marking the 20th anniversary of
the establishment of diplomatic ties between the ROC and St. Vincent
and Grenadines.</P>
      <P>Chang said during an inspection tour of the Overseas Chinese
Affairs Commission that U.S. stopovers by ROC government officials
should respect the rules of the two countries. He added that his
being allowed to visit four U.S. cities can be considered as a
"diplomatic advance" and expressed hope that this can help strengthen
bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>He added that although the U.S. and ROC authorities have some
"understandings" on restrictions on ROC government officials'
activities during their transit in U.S., he hopes to meet overseas
Chinese there to let them know more about Taiwan's "real situation"
and vice versa.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EX-OFFICIAL ANNOUNCES CANDIDACY FOR HUALIEN COUNTY CHIEF RACE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  21  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Yu Ying-lung, a Soochow University
professor, announced his decision Tuesday to accept the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) offer to run as its candidate
in the Hualien County magistrate election scheduled for Dec. 1.</P>
      <P>The political science professor told a news conference that it
was a tough decision for him to make to quit his teaching post and
opt for a political career.</P>
      <P>"After a period of soul searching, I have finally decided to
express my love for my homeland with concrete action. I'll change my
role from a political science scholar to a down-to-earth `political
worker,'" Yu said.</P>
      <P>Yu resigned from the post of vice chairman of the Cabinet-level
Research, Development and Evaluation Commission early this year to
take part in the DPP primary for party nomination for the year-end
legislative elections in the Hualien constituency. Yu, however, was
unsuccessful in his bid.</P>
      <P>He said that he had originally planned to quit politics forever.
But after a series of meetings with top government and party
officials in recent weeks, Yu said, he has changed his mind.</P>
      <P>"The central government's strong commitment to promoting
development and construction projects in the eastern part of the
island was a decisive factor in my decision to enter the year-end
election race," Yu explained.</P>
      <P>In his view, Yu said the government's plans to build a
science-based industrial park in eastern Taiwan and to speed up
railway services between Taipei and Hualien are feasible and that the
projects can bring prosperity to the eastern Taiwan county.</P>
      <P>Hualien County has long been controlled by the erstwhile ruling
and now opposition Kuomintang (KMT). The DPP's support base in the
county remains limited. In the 2000 presidential election,
independent candidate James Soong, now chairman of the opposition
People First Party (PFP), won the largest share of the vote in the
county.</P>
      <P>Both the KMT and the PFP have fielded their own candidates for
the county chief elections. The DPP decided to draft Yu to represent
the party in the race after Typhoon Toraji wreaked havoc in the
county's mountainous regions in late July.</P>
      <P>The DPP leadership reportedly hopes that Yu's participation in
the contest can help expand the party's power base in this rural
county known for its beautiful natural scenery.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC EXPRESSES REGRET OVER BEIJING'S MIXING POLITICS WITH SPORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) issued a press release Tuesday expressing its deep regret over
mainland China's failure to separate politics from sports.</P>
      <P>The council, which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China,
issued the press statement after mainland China demanded that
Republic of China Minister of Education Ovid Tzeng enter Beijing with
a "Taiwan compatriot entry permit" to attend the opening ceremony for
the World University Games (WUC) scheduled for Aug. 22-Sept. 1.</P>
      <P>The MAC statement said that since mainland Chinese WUC organizers
had issued a VIP card to Tzeng, Beijing authorities should not have
rejected Tzeng's use of the card to gain entry into the country.</P>
      <P>Tzeng, who was originally scheduled to leave for Beijing Tuesday,
has canceled his mainland travel plan as he said he felt that
Beijing's demand that he use a "Taiwan compatriot entry permit" was a
deliberate attempt to downgrade the ROC's status.</P>
      <P>The "Taiwan compatriot entry permit" is a special travel paper
issued by mainland Chinese authorities to prospective ROC visitors.</P>
      <P>The MAC said it supports Tzeng's decision to cancel his mainland
travel plan to safeguard national dignity.</P>
      <P>"We feel regret over Beijing's failure to let `sports be sports
and politics be politics,'" the MAC said in its press release.</P>
      <P>The ROC has sent a delegation of athletes to take part in the
World University Games, the first major international sports event to
be hosted by Beijing since it won the right to host the 2008 Olympic
Games last month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DRAM MANUFACTURERS FACING SLUGGISH SALES IN NEXT TWO YEARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  21 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Oversupply and falling prices have forced
down the production value of DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) and
global production value this year will only reach US$14.2 billion, as
compared with US$29 billion the previous year, according to an
industrial source.</P>
      <P>Chang Tung-lung, vice general manager and spokesman of Mosel
Vitelic Inc., said Tuesday that DRAM manufacturers are facing the
worst setback in business sales this year, and only a gradual
recovery can be expected next year.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the global production value of DRAM is expected
to drop considerably this year due to large inventories of
communications-related products and a global economic recession.</P>
      <P>In the first quarter of this year, the sales value of DRAM
manufacturers all over the world was 31 percent less than that of the
same period last year. Moreover, the second quarter value was 28.5
percent less than that of the first quarter.</P>
      <P>Mosel Vitelic is one of Taiwan's leading DRAM manufacturers. In
the first six months of this year, it's revenues amounted to NT$6.1
billion, down 57.32 percent from NT$14.4 billion during the same
period of the previous year.</P>
      <P>Chang said that from January to June, Mosel Vitelic had a deficit
before tax of NT$7.2 billion, and the deficit for the whole year of
2001 may exceed NT$10 billion.</P>
      <P>However, he said long-term prospects for DRAM manufacturers
remain positive. Starting late next year, the market is expected to
recover gradually, and the global production value by 2004 is
expected to reach a new peak of US$39 billion, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PLA MILITARY DRILLS AROUND DONGSHAN ISLAND UNDER SCRUTINY: MND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) has
been closely monitoring mainland China's ongoing military exercises
near its southeastern coast on Dongshan Island, military spokesman
Huang Suey-sheng said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Noting that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has annually
conducted drills around Dongshan Island, Huang said the current
exercises are routine.</P>
      <P>"We have kept a close watch on the PLA training exercises," Huang
said, adding that the MND could not give any details about the
content of the PLA's ongoing exercises for the sake of protecting
Taiwan's intelligence security.</P>
      <P>Huang went on to say that like the armed forces of all countries
around the world, the PLA routinely conducts various kinds of
training drills annually.</P>
      <P>This year, Huang said, mainland China's official mouthpiece and
Hong Kong news media have continuously given sensational coverage to
the PLA's Dongshan Island exercises.</P>
      <P>"We believe this is part of mainland China's consistent
saber-rattling strategy toward Taiwan. They use their official
mouthpiece to give exaggerated reports of the military live-fire war
games to intimidate the people of Taiwan and try to wear them down
psychologically," Huang said.</P>
      <P>He urged local news media to refrain from dancing to the beat of
their mainland Chinese counterparts and to base their reports on the
PLA activities mainly on MND press releases to avoid affecting public
morale.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong's pro-Beijing Chinese-language daily Wen Wei Po
reported Tuesday that the PLA will launch its largest-ever integrated
military exercises around Dongshan Island Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Quoting unnamed sources, the paper said top military leaders of
mainland China's central military commission will arrive in Dongshan,
near Fujian province, to watch the war games. Fujian lies opposite
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The paper also reported in its Sunday edition that the upcoming
exercises would simulate an invasion of the Taiwan-controlled Penghu
islands.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese fishing boats and other vessels have been given
advance notice to stay out of the region and return to port, the
paper said.</P>
      <P>The military exercises, which have already lasted four months,
are the largest the PLA has ever conducted in terms of scale,
duration, total number of personnel involved and advanced weaponry
used, the paper said, adding that some 100,000 troops have been
involved.</P>

      <P>Taipei, Aug. 21 (CNA): The Ministry of Economic Affairs has
decided to set up a "small and medium business development
corporation" to help small businesses with the potential to raise
capital and to seek technical cooperation possibilities.</P>
      <P>An official of the ministry's Small and Medium Enterprise
Administration, said Tuesday that small businesses in general have
had difficulties raising capital, especially in times of economic
recession.</P>
      <P>Accounting for nearly 98 percent of Taiwan's enterprises, small
and medium businesses are the backbone of Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>To help start-ups, the Small and Medium Enterprise Administration
has set up 56 small and medium enterprise development centers around
the island since 1996. The centers with laboratory and training
facilities are providing new companies with consultative services. As
of the end of June, more than 700 start-ups in the fields of
information, electronics, automation, multi-media, medical care,
bio-technology and the environmental protection sectors have received
services from the centers.</P>
      <P>While funding the businesses remains a problem for many
start-ups, the ministry has decided to set up a development
corporation, which can make capital investments in a new business,
the official said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SPENDING IN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION LOW: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  21  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's investment in environmental
protection as a ratio to its GDP (gross domestic product) is well
below the levels of developed countries, the Cabinet-level Council
for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's spending for environmental protection as a ratio to the
country's GDP was 0.91 percent in 1999, or US$120 for each Taiwan
national, the CEPD quoted statistics compiled by the Environmental
Protection Administration as saying.</P>
      <P>Although the figure is 4.3 percentage points higher than the 1998
level, the CEPD said it is still far behind the United States' US$422
in 1994, Germany's US$310 in 1995 and South Korea's US$268 in 1997.</P>
      <P>Analyzing Taiwan's need for natural resources and its
capabilities to dispose of waste based on a set of measures devised
by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the
CEPD said Taiwan's emissions of carbon dioxide are relatively higher
than those of other countries and called it an indication that the
island should develop low carbon emission industries.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 21 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Chang Chun-hsiung
reiterated Tuesday that the ROC government will abide by the
memorandum of trade and investment signed by the ROC and Paraguay to
further cement the established ties between Taipei and Asuncion.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang made the promise while meeting with visiting
Paraguayan Foreign Minister Jose Antonio Moreno Ruffinelli at the
Executive Yuan Tuesday morning.</P>
      <P>Chang, on behalf of the ROC government and people, extended his
warm welcome to Moreno and expressed his gratitude for the foreign
minister's contributions to promoting relations between the two
countries and his support for the ROC's bids for membership in
international organizations.</P>
      <P>Moreno said that the establishment of relations between the ROC
and Paraguay was not based on material interests but on the common
ideas of freedom and democracy.</P>
      <P>Facing stiff economic challenges in the Southern Cone Common
Market (MERCOSUL), in which Paraguay is one of the founding
countries, Paraguay is trying to open its foreign markets, including
those in Southeast Asian countries, Moreno said.</P>
      <P>The Paraguayan government attached importance to the ROC-Paraguay
Trade and Investment Memorandum signed between ROC President Chen
Shui-bian and Paraguayan President Luis Angel Gonzalez Macchi during
President Chen's last visit to Paraguay in June this year, Moreno
said.</P>
      <P>The Paraguayan diplomatic head also expressed his hope that the
ROC and Paraguay will strengthen cooperation on economic and trade
issues to help Paraguay tap into the Asian market. Moreno also said
that the Paraguayan government has mapped out economic development
strategies to be based on agriculture and industry.</P>
      <P>Moreno arrived in Taipei Monday for a weeklong visit. During his
stay in Taiwan, Moreno will be received by President Chen and call on
ROC government officials, including Minister of Foreign Affairs Tien
Hung-mao. He will also visit economic and cultural establishments
before concluding his visit on Aug. 25.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT VOWS TO PUSH FOR INTERMINISTERIAL RESOURCES INTEGRATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  Taiwan,  Aug.  21  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said
Tuesday he will push the Cabinet to do more to integrate the
resources of various government departments to upgrade the nation's
overall competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Chen made the comment while attending a ceremony marking the
delivery of the 100th empennage, or airplane tail, by Taiwan's
state-owned Aerospace Industry Development Corp. (AIDC) to Boeing Co.
of the United States.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony held at the AIDC factory in Shalu in the
central county of Taichung, Chen said the AIDC is responsible for
upgrading the performance and combat capability of locally developed
defense fighter aircraft as well as the island's civil aviation
technology.</P>
      <P>"Against this backdrop, the AIDC faces difficult challenges and
needs the support of all relevant government agencies," Chen said,
adding that integration of the resources of various government
departments is critical to the AIDC's operations and the development
of the domestic civil aviation industry.</P>
      <P>The AIDC, Taiwan's only aircraft manufacturer, was originally the
Republic of China's military manufacturing arm. It developed and
produced the ROC Air Force's Ching-kuo Indigenous Defense Fighters
(IDFs). As part of the government's efforts to expand the AIDC's role
in the development of the civil aviation industry, the AIDC was
reorganized into a corporate-style enterprise under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs a few years ago.</P>
      <P>President Chen said he is pleased to see the AIDC cooperating
with Boeing and other major foreign aerospace companies in producing
commercial aircraft, helicopters and transport aircraft.</P>
      <P>The AIDC is one of the 15 companies in nine countries, including
Australia, Canada and Germany, to cooperate with Boeing in developing
the B717-200 twin-engine, 100-seat passenger plane. Boeing plans to
produce a total of 600 B717-200s and has so far secured orders for
297 planes. The AIDC is responsible for manufacturing the aircraft's
empennage.</P>
      <P>The 100th empennage delivery ceremony started with President Chen
and Boeing representative Ralph Adams slowly unveiling a red satin
cloth covering an empennage.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi, Deputy
Secretary-General to the President Eugene Chien, Taichung County
Magistrate Liao Yung-lai and other government officials and elected
representatives also attended the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Chen said the cooperative project with Boeing indicates the
AIDC's determination to move toward globalization and corporate-style
operations in addition to continuing its role in manufacturing
military planes.</P>
      <P>Chen further said that the government is determined to promote
the privatization of the AIDC to upgrade its operational efficiency
and competitiveness in the global aerospace market.</P>
      <P>"I hope AIDC management personnel will adopt flexible strategies
and use wisdom and vision to lead the company to realize its goal of
becoming a world-class aerospace company and help boost the
development of our aviation industry," the president added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPOWER WIND TURBINES ON PENGHU BEGIN COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two wind turbines installed in the offshore
island county of Penghu by the state-run Taiwan Power Company
(Taipower) began generating electricity recently, in an operation
that is both beneficial to Taipower and the island's environment.</P>
      <P>Taking advantage of Penghu's year-round strong winds, Taipower
invested NT$150 million (US$4.34 million) in the windmill plant in
Penghu's Chungtunyu township, installing four wind turbines which are
expected to have a combined generation capacity of 2,400 kilowatts,
according to Taipower officials.</P>
      <P>The first two turbines became operational in August -- ahead of
schedule -- while the third and fourth are expected to begin
commercial production in September, said Chen Hsin-cheng, director of
the plant.</P>
      <P>The four horizontal axis wind turbines, using German-made ENERCON
turbines, are expected to lower Taipower's costs of electricity
generation in Penghu by NT$5 per kilowatt/hour, substantively cutting
the losses that Taipower has incurred over the past decades when it
used diesel to generate power in the offshore county.</P>
      <P>Until recently, Taipower has spent NT$8 for each KWH of
electricity that the company generates in Penghu, but has sold the
power to Penghu households and other electricity users at an average
rate of NT$2.2 per KWH, resulting in Taiwan's sole power supplier
losing NT$1 billion per year, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>In comparison, wind power costs Taipower only NT$3 for each KWH
of electricity.</P>
      <P>The windmills have the additional benefit of being
environmentally "clean" and producing none of the air pollution
caused by the diesel-powered plant on the island.</P>
      <P>The four white wind turbines, located on the yellow sand beach of
Chungtunyu, will also be a tourism attraction, Chen added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>400-PLUS UNDERPRIVILEGED GROUPS PROTEST EDAC PROPOSALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 400 underprivileged groups issued
a joint statement Tuesday urging the government not to yield to
pressure from business groups to adopt certain "unfair, unjust and
short-sighted" economy boosting measures.</P>
      <P>Representatives of labor, environmental and disabled groups from
around the island, led by Liu Hsia and Huang Ching-hsien, two
national policy advisers to the president, issued the joint appeal at
a news conference held at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Liu, a handicapped writer, said she is worried that the
soon-to-be-convened Economic Development Advisory Conference (EDAC)
will be dominated by commerce and industry delegates and will reach
conclusions in their favor at the expense of the interests of the
underprivileged and even the entire nation.</P>
      <P>"Our petition is aimed at reminding President Chen Shui-bian to
honor his campaign promises to bring hope and happiness to middle-
and low-income families as well as the underprivileged," Liu said,
adding that they also want to remind Chen "not to lean toward
capitalism."</P>
      <P>Huang, who concurrently serves as one the three conveners of the
EDAC employment panel, said he is dismayed by many of the proposals
reached at EDAC panel sessions so far.</P>
      <P>For instance, Huang said, the EDAC cross-Taiwan Strait affairs
panel has come up with a proposal to ease curbs on mainland
China-bound investment, even though now is not the right time for
Taiwan to relax its "go slow, be patient" policy on mainland
investments.</P>
      <P>"I'm afraid that once large local enterprises are allowed to
invest in mainland China, Taiwan's unemployment rate will shoot up to
10 percent and 1 million labor families will face livelihood
difficulties," he said.</P>
      <P>The join statement issued by the 400-plus underprivileged groups
pointed out that the initial EDAC proposals to suspend the stock
transaction tax, halve the land value increment tax, cancel the
environmental impact evaluation mechanism, reduce the number of paid
holidays for laborers and freeze living subsidies for the elderly
have all violated the principles of social justice.</P>
      <P>"Those proposals, if implemented, would expand the government's
budget deficits, worsen Taiwan's living environment, sacrifice
welfare services for senior citizens and lower labor working
conditions," the joint statement said.</P>
      <P>It demanded that the Chen administration refrain from accepting
the demands of the island vested interest business groups to avoid
hindering Taiwan's long-term development and the establishment of a
sound social security system.</P>
      <P>The joint petition also demanded that the government avoid
pursuing economic growth at the expense of environmental protection,
labor rights and social welfare services.</P>
      <P>The proposals presented by the five EDAC preparatory panels are
pending discussion and approval by the EDAC plenary sessions
scheduled for Aug. 24-26.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT TO PUSH FOR INTER-PARTY MEETING AFTER EDAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  21  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan
said Tuesday that the KMT will take actions to push for inter-party
consultations after the Aug. 24-26 Economic Development Advisory
Conference (EDAC).</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks after listening to briefings by KMT's EDAC
representatives on preparations for the much-anticipated conference
aimed at seeking feasible ways to revitalize Taiwan's faltering
economy.</P>
      <P>Lien said the KMT, which controls a majority in the current
Legislative Yuan, will play a leading role in holding inter-party
consultations on measures to substantiate consensus or conclusions
to be reached at the EDAC.</P>
      <P>Lien said inter-party consultations are needed to facilitate
revisions to existing laws and legislate new statutes to pave the
way for implementing EDAC consensus.</P>
      <P>Lien said the erstwhile ruling and now opposition KMT will
supervise the Democratic Progressive Party-led minority government
in implementing EDAC consensus.</P>
      <P>"We'll also push the DPP government to work out timetables for
easing restrictions on mainland China-bound investments and opening
direct 'three links' across the Taiwan Strait," Lien said, adding
that he had discussed the issues with opposition People
First Party Chairman James Soong.</P>
      <P>In addition to proposals concerning cross-strait affairs, Lien
said, the KMT will also present its views on other major economic
issues at the upcoming EDAC plenary session, including upgrading
industrial technology, promoting high-tech industry development,
upgrading management of small- and medium-sized enterprises,
ensuring sufficient supplies of water and electricity, balancing
environmental protection and industrial development, revising labor
laws and regulations, accelerating financial reforms and
modernizing taxation and budget systems.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lien renewed his three appeals, urging the
DPP government to respect the constitutional system,
substantiate political accountability and promoting
constructive cross-strait interaction.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ripples caused by former President Lee
Teng-hui continued to spread within the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Tuesday, with his supporters urging lenience and patience and his
critics demanding his expulsion from the party he used to head.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, who is considered to be
one of Lee's political allies within the KMT, cautioned the party to
deal carefully with the controversy surrounding Lee in order to avoid
a backlash against the party itself in the year-end legislative
elections.</P>
      <P>In an interview with a local radio station, Wang defended his
claims that Lee offered to stump for KMT candidates in the elections.</P>
      <P>Wang recounted that he and KMT Vice Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung
visited Lee Aug. 10. He said he praised Lee for fostering many KMT
politicians during his 12-year tenure as party chief, whereupon Lee
said he would stump for his political proteges if necessary.</P>
      <P>Wang's claims, made Aug. 15, were dismissed by the newly founded
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) the next day as a "political placebo
concocted by Wang," adding that Lee would not extend his support to
any candidate other than TSU nominees.</P>
      <P>The TSU's argument was corroborated by Lee himself Monday when he
spoke to reporters who inquired about his willingness to campaign for
KMT candidates.</P>
      <P>As his presence at the inauguration of the TSU Aug. 12 along with
Lee, Wang said he attended the occasion in his capacity as president
of the Legislative Yuan rather than as KMT vice chairman.</P>
      <P>Support from the TSU, which has filed 39 candidates to run in the
legislative election, would only help Wang's bid for re-election as
legislative speaker, according to local political analysts.</P>
      <P>He urged the KMT to take the year-end elections into account
while dealing with the controversy surrounding Lee.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Central Standing Committee member Hung Hsiu-chu
threatened to move to expel Lee from the party in the following day's
meeting of the Central Standing Committee if Lee refuses to quit on
his own.</P>
      <P>She made the threat after Lee publicly identified himself with
the TSU's mission and threw his weight behind the party Monday while
presiding over a training camp for TSU candidates.</P>
      <P>Hung said Lee's betrayal of the KMT is evident and that the issue
has come to a head. The party, she said, can no longer turn a deaf
ear to Lee's words and close its eyes to his deeds.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien Chan, when asked for comment on Lee's purported
lambasting of the KMT Monday to TSU candidates, snapped curtly: "I am
not interested."</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Lin Fong-cheng's answer was more
diplomatic. He said: "Our party will deal carefully with questions
concerning Lee's words and deeds."</P>
      <P>Lee's Monday speech, in which he likened himself to a worried
father being forced to engage in politics after retirement because he
cannot stand by and watch his "two feuding sons" undo his 12 years of
work, drew flak from his political rivals Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chou Hsi-wei of the opposition People First Party
(PFP) criticized Lee for trying to justify his desire to hang on to
power by passing himself off as the country's patriarch.</P>
      <P>The PFP whip at the Legislative Yuan said Lee -- who blamed the
KMT for failing to carry out his line, or the so-called "Lee Teng-hui
road" -- never actually spelled out his line clearly.</P>
      <P>Another PFP legislator, Chin Huei-chu, said Lee's recent behavior
vindicates the PFP's claims from the very beginning that he is
political burden, not a political asset of the KMT.</P>
      <P>The PFP was founded by former KMT Secretary-General James Soong
after he fell out with Lee in the lead-up to the 2000 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>Yet another of Lee's political rivals, former New Party
legislator Yok Mu-ming, who is to run in the year-end elections,
claimed that Lee had been named by the TSU as a candidate for
"legislator-at-large," positions which are meted out in proportion to
the number of votes garnered by political parties in elections.</P>
      <P>However, Yok's claims were immediately denied by TSU spokesman Su
Chin-chiang, who described them as "nonsense." Su said his party has
not yet named candidates for non-elected lawmakers and has never
considered putting Lee on its candidate list.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Acer Incorporated, one of Taiwan's
leading computer manufacturers, has set a target of NT$150 billion
(US$4.34 billion)-worth of business transactions in three years after
a spate of re-organization efforts.</P>
      <P>Acer Incorporated, the flagship of the Acer group, is scheduled
to annex Acer Sertek Inc., an important export arm of Acer-made
computers and related products, in early 2001. This will allow the
Acer Incorporated to target its NT$150 billion goal, which would see
annual profits reaching NT$14-15 billion, according to Peng
Ching-ping, head of Acer Group's Finance Department.</P>
      <P>Stan Shih, Acer group founder, CEO and chairman, said
integration from within the conglomerate is one of the vital
directions that will allow the group to survive cut-throat
competition and to reinvigorate itself during lean years.</P>
      <P>To begin with the integration process, Acer group began in 1999
to turn management of all of its overseas operations -- scattered
throughout Europe, the United States, Southeast Asia, Latin America
and mainland China -- over to a single headquarters based in Taipei.</P>
      <P>At the end of 2000, a spate of integration kicked off, including
a merger of the group's key software maker and a PC magazine, a

    <HEADLINE>CONSTRUCTION OF RESEARCH REACTOR TO BE SUSPENDED FOR THREE YEARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  21  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A panel under the Atomic Energy Council
(AEC) decided Tuesday to suspend the construction of Taiwan Research
Reactor II (TRR II)..</P>
      <P>The panel, made up of Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh and
five other experts, based their decision on the government's tight
budget and the fact that reinvigorating the sagging economy is its
chief concern at present, according to AEC Vice Chairman Ouyang
Min-sheng.</P>
      <P>Although the panel's decision is "meant to relieve the
government's financial burden," Ouyang said his council will seek to
keep the budget -- about NT$200 million to NT$300 million (US$5.88
million to US$8.82 million) per year and NT$800 million to NT$1
billion (US$23.52 million to US$29.41 million) over three years --
and use it to finance research alternative energy sources.</P>
      <P>Noting that nuclear research has already taken deep root in
Taiwan, Ouyang said his council hopes to use the budget to help the
Institute of Nuclear Energy Research under the AEC to adjust its
studies and keep its nuclear researchers in the field.</P>
      <P>The TRR II budget for this year -- NT$38 million (US$1.11
million) -- has already been reimbursed and will be used to demolish
the island's original research reactor, Ouyang said.</P>
      <P>The original research reactor, purchased from Canada in 1969 for
scientific research, was forced to shut down by Washington in 1988
after it was found to have been used secretly for military purposes.</P>
      <P>The Institute of Nuclear Energy Research came up with a plan in
1990 to improve the TRR II reactor rather than demolish it.</P>
      <P>The plan, which passed the National Science Council in 1998 and
was approved by the Executive Yuan the same year, envisioned the
reconstruction of the reactor in seven years at a cost of NT$3.28
billion.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's imminent entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO) is expected to reduce the
manufacturing industries' demand for workers by 170,000, Minister
of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lin made remarks at a meeting of the Taiwan Confectionery,
Biscuit and Floury Food Association, in which Lin asked association
members to globalize in anticipation of the country's entry into WTO.</P>
      <P>As a result, Lin said, the local manufacturing industry may
have to lay off 170,000 workers after WTO entry.</P>
      <P>According to a prediction by the Ministry of Economic Affairs,
the contribution of the manufacturing sector to the nation's gross
domestic product (GDP) will continue to decline from present 27
percent to 21 percent after the WTO entry, while the service industry
is expected to contribute more to the GDP, said Lin.</P>
      <P>He further predicted that the manufacturing sector's contribution
to the GDP will continue to decline to between 15 percent and 20
percent.</P>
      <P>Lin added that the increase of Taiwan's outbound investment and
the decrease of inbound investment in the manufacturing sector has

killing two and injuring 211.

    <HEADLINE>BUSINESSES SAY OKINAWA MAY SERVE AS ENTREPOT FOR CROSS-STRAIT TRADE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  22  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Members from Taiwan's business sector
suggested Wednesday that the Republic of China government use Okinawa
as a transshipment point to help open direct cross-strait air links,
said Huang Ho-ming, chairman of the non-profit Institute for
Information Industry.</P>
      <P>Some business leaders in Taiwan have suggested that the
government consider using Japan's Okinawa prefecture as a midway
point between Taiwan and mainland China to facilitate the opening of
direct air links across the Taiwan Strait without having the ROC's
sovereignty compromised, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Addressing a luncheon meeting held by the Taipei-based European
Council of Commerce and Trade (ECCT), Huang said the Okinawa idea is
one of the suggestions that the domestic business sector offered to
the government amid increased calls from the administration and the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party to ease curbs on trade with
mainland China and to phase out the "no haste, be patient" trade
policy.</P>
      <P>Huang said, however, that Taiwan should expect to face problems
from Beijing on direct air links despite Taiwan's open-mindedness.
Beijing insists that Taiwan is within mainland China's aviation
information control zone -- an advocacy tantamount to a proclamation
that Beijing has sovereignty over Taiwan, a concept unacceptable to
Taipei.</P>
      <P>Unconfirmed sources reported that Wang Fuqing, deputy director of
the Taiwan Affairs Office under Beijing's State Council, said Tuesday
in Fuzhou that direct trade, travel and communications links across
the Taiwan Strait can be launched very soon, "as long as the 'three
links' activities are considered as internal affairs and conducted
between businesses in a private capacity."</P>
      <P>Huang noted that using Okinawa as a middle ground -- Taiwan
carriers flying first to Okinawa and from there heading to cities in
mainland China -- would involve two aviation information control
zones, with Taiwan's sovereignty remaining intact.</P>
      <P>It could be a pragmatic approach to skirt the current political
deadlock over the direct air links issue, Huang added.</P>
      <P>Huang solicited support for the Okinawa concept from foreign
businesses in Taiwan, including members of the ECCT.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NUMBER OF FOREIGN LABORERS DROPS SHARPLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's foreign labor retrenchment
policy has finally borne fruit after nearly a year of implementation
as the total number of legal foreign workers registered a sharp
decline in July, the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the latest CLA statistics, Taiwan had 326,261 alien
workers at the end of July. The number marked a decrease of 3,351
from a historic high of 329,612 recorded in June.</P>
      <P>The CLA tallies also showed that Indonesia replaced the
Philippines for the first time in July as Taiwan's second largest
foreign labor import source.</P>
      <P>In terms of nationality, Thailand remained the top source of
foreign labor imports in July, accounting for 139,924 or 42.89
percent of total foreign workers. Compared with June, the number of
Thai workers declined 1,868.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the number of Indonesian workers increased 1,170 to
reach 89,608 in July, making up 27.47 percent of the total.
Indonesians now form the backbone of foreign caregivers and
housemaids in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The number of Philippine workers has been falling steadily since
the suspension of direct flight services between Taiwan and the
Philippines. CLA officials said the Philippines representative
office's interference with labor-management disputes was also a major
reason behind the decrease in Filipinos.</P>
      <P>At the end of July, 85,787 Philippine nationals were working in
Taiwan, down 2,986 from June. The number marked an even greater
decline from a peak of 110,000 recorded not long ago.</P>
      <P>Taiwan began to import blue-collar workers from Vietnam last year
and the number of Vietnamese laborers had already reached 10,869 by
the end of July.</P>
      <P>According to CLA tallies, 73 Malaysian nationals still worked in
Taiwan at the end of July. Malaysia itself faces labor shortage
problems.</P>
      <P>Of all foreign workers, 105,559 were working as caregivers in
July; 57,297 were working for major investment projects in the
manufacturing sector; and 33,026 were working for large
infrastructure construction projects.</P>

lower  on  the  Taiwan  Stock Exchange (TAIEX) on Wednesday, with the
weighted  index, the market's key barometer, moving down 75.21 points
to close at 4,487.52.

of  NT$46.93 billion (US$1.36 billion), an increase from the previous

market turnover of NT$39.85 billion (US$1.15 billion).

    Only  one  of  the eight major stock categories lost ground, with

stocks  and  bank  and  insurance shares, both at 1.1 percent, cement
stocks and pulp and paper issues, both at 0.4 percent.

    <HEADLINE>U.S. RESEARCHER ADVOCATES CHEN'S ATTENDANCE AT SHANGHAI APEC MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  21  (CNA)
(By Nelosn Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Both the U.S. Congress and the Bush
administration should encourage the Communist Chinese leadership to
invite Taiwan's president, Chen Shui-bian, to attend the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum's Shanghai summit, according to a U.S.
researcher.</P>
      <P>In an analysis titled "China-Taiwan dialogue could begin at the
APEC summit," John J. Tkacik Jr., a research fellow in China policy
in the Asian Studies Center at The Heritage Foundation, wrote that,
"This could be an early sign that the United States must prepare for
a prolonged period of firmness with China if peace and stability in
the Pacific are to be preserved."</P>
      <P>Beijing's continued insistence on barring Chen's attendance could
be construed as evidence that Communist China may opt to use force to
impose its will in the Taiwan Strait, Tkacik said.</P>
      <P>Given the importance of Taiwan to both the national security and
economic interests of the United States, Rep. Gary Ackerman (D-N.Y.)
submitted House Concurrent Resolution 194 in late July expressing the
sentiments of Congress to encourage full participation in the APEC
summit by President Chen.</P>
      <P>Tkacik pointed out that by denying Chen a chance to attend the
Shanghai summit, "China is missing an historic opportunity to begin
substantive dialogue with its neighbor across the Taiwan Strait. The
forum could begin a process of defusing a half-century of pent-up
tension in one of the world's most dangerous flash points."</P>
      <P>The Ackerman resolution could provide a crucial push to break the
stalemate between mainland China and Taiwan, promoting "direct
dialogue, without precondition, between leaders on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait." The resolution, which will be voted on in early
September, acknowledges that President Chen's attendance at the
summit would be "a constructive step" and an ideal starting point for
peaceful cross-strait dialogue -- a key objective of the United
States' China policy in the administrations of both Bill Clinton and
George W. Bush, he said.</P>
      <P>In September, a representative of President Bush will visit
Beijing to review the agenda for a forthcoming visit by the U.S.
president. With the House resolution in hand, that envoy could
present an authoritative demarche urging Communist China's leadership
to be open to the possibility of direct dialogue without precondition
with Taiwan's leader about their points of disagreement and encourage
Beijing's leaders to invite the democratically elected leader of the
people of Taiwan to the APEC Shanghai summit, Tkacik said .</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN EXPORT ORDERS POST DOUBLE-DIGIT FALL IN JULY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  22  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's export orders received in July
slid 16.8 percent year-on-year to US$10.80 billion as a result of
global and domestic sluggishness, sources from the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The country's industrial output also declined in July -- down
10.39 percent year-on-year -- due to a drastic fall in the export
trade, said Chang Yao-tsung, director-general of the MOEA Statistics
Department.</P>
      <P>Export orders received by Taiwan's electronics manufacturing
sector -- the backbone of the island's foreign exchange
reserves-earning export trade system -- plummeted by a more alarming
rate of 36.17 percent over the year-earlier levels, which was also
the largest fall in this area in history, according to MOEA tallies.</P>
      <P>Chang attributed the unprecedented fall in the electronics export
sector in July mainly to a high comparison basis set in July 2000,
when most electronics companies posted growth ranging from 60 percent
to 80 percent.</P>
      <P>Chang forecast that the sharp decline in export orders may ease
in the last two quarters this year, but it will still rely on a
rebound of domestic consumption and demand to drive any recovery.</P>
      <P>He does not think the U.S. Fed's interest rates cut will have an
immediate positive impact on Taiwan's export trade. The U.S. Fed has
cut rates seven times this year.</P>
      <P>The slowing economies in Japan and Europe will not contribute to
help Taiwan's exports pick up either, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) estimated Wednesday that
Taiwan's export and import trade in August would shrink 25 percent
and 30 percent, respectively, from the year-earlier levels, marking
the largest single-month fall in history.</P>
      <P>According to the latest MOF statistics, Taiwan exported US$5.54
billion worth of products in the Aug. 1-17 period, while importing
US$5.09 billion worth of goods from abroad, down 24.9 percent and
27.7 percent, respectively from the corresponding period in 2000.</P>
      <P>MOF officials forecast that Taiwan's export trade will decline
14.9 percent this year while import trade could fall 19.1 percent as
a result of the global economic downturn.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN PORTS HANDLING FEWER CONTAINERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  22  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Due to dwindling import and export trade
resulting from the global economic downturn, the total number of
cargo containers handled by Taiwan ports dropped in the first half of
this year, according to statistics released recently by the
government.</P>
      <P>Tallies compiled by the Cabinet-level Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) show that the total number
of cargo containers loaded and unloaded by Taiwan's Keelung, Taichung
and Kaohsiung ports in the first six months fell by 0.5 percent from
the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>According to the DGBAS, the three ports handled a total of 5.12
TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) in the first half, 3.69 million
of which were handled by Kaohsiung, up 2.1 percentage points from a
year ago, while the number of TEUs handled by Keelung and Taichung
were down 6.3 percent and 7 percent, respectively, year-on-year.</P>
      <P>The decline in the first half is in stark contrast to growth in
the past, such as an annual increase of 10.1 percent for 1999 and 7.7
percent for 2000, business sources said, attributing the fall to the
sluggish traditional industries which used to form the bulk of
container cargoes. They warned that a severe challenge is awaiting
the local industry.</P>
      <P>During the same six-month period, the number of import and export
containers handled by the three major Taiwan ports also declined by 5
percent and 4.5 percent, respectively, from a year ago, owing to the
fact that Taiwan's export and import sectors shrank by 10.8 percent
and 16.9 percent, respectively.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HOUSEHOLD LAW TO BE REVISED TO CANCEL FINGERPRINT REQUIREMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet approved a draft revision to
the existing household registration law Wednesday to cancel a
regulation that requires Republic of China nationals aged over 14 to
have their fingerprints taken while applying for ID cards.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet passed the draft amendment at its weekly meeting. The
revision bill will then be referred to the Legislative Yuan for
screening and approval.</P>
      <P>In preparation for a nationwide identification card renewal plan,
the current Democratic Progressive Party-led administration has been
evaluating since its inauguration the appropriateness of the existing
fingerprinting requirement.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the Cabinet meeting, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said
the compulsory fingerprint regulation will be scrapped to protect
human rights.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet issued a news release after its weekly meeting to
further explain reasons behind its decision.</P>
      <P>First and foremost, the news statement said, it has become
dubious or questionable whether the establishment of a fingerprint
databank can truly facilitate criminal investigations and crime
prevention now that sophisticated criminal activities have become
prevalent and that few criminals would leave fingerprints at crime
scenes.</P>
      <P>Second, the news release said it seems to be out of proportion to
require all ROC nationals aged over 14 to have their fingerprints
taken simply for facilitating determination of the identities of a
few unidentified corpses or homeless people.</P>
      <P>Third, the statement said that as fingerprints are a personal
feature, it should be protected under Article 22 of the ROC
Constitution and other relevant laws that protect personal
information or privacy.</P>
      <P>The statement further said the reasonableness of forcing ordinary
citizens to be fingerprinted while applying for ID cards is doubtful
as the current household registration law has not prescribed clear
rules governing the purposes and scope of the use of the
fingerprints.</P>
      <P>Finally, the statement said that at present, only a few countries
in the world demand that all of its people have their fingerprints
taken and no advanced countries have implemented such a system.</P>
      <P>"If we continue this practice, our national image may be
undermined," the statement added.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan on Wednesday instructed the party's Evaluation and Disciplinary
Committee to study how to deal with former KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui
for his apparent "betrayal" of the KMT.</P>
      <P>Lien instructed that the situation regarding Lee be handled in
accordance with "party rules," saying that no member of the party,
irrespective of their position, should be treated as an exception to
the system. He also said that the KMT "should do whatever it must" to
protect the interests of the party.</P>
      <P>Wednesday was the first time that Lien has given specific
instructions concerning Lee, who said earlier this month that he
wanted to form a political party to help the present minority
government of President Chen Shui-bian win enough seats in the
year-end legislative elections to gain a stable majority.</P>
      <P>Lee further raised the ire of KMT members after he publicly
identified himself with the mission of the newly established Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) party, and threw his weight behind the TSU
Monday while presiding over a political workshop for TSU legislative
candidates.</P>
      <P>Despite Lee's apparent drift from the KMT, decision-makers within
the party have taken a passive approach toward Lee, continuing to
shelve proposals that Lee be reprimanded for his presence at the
inauguration of the TSU on Aug. 12 -- a party founded mainly by Lee's
followers and supporters -- on the grounds that any action that could
mar the image and effectiveness of the party should be seriously
studied before being put into action.</P>
      <P>During a KMT Central Standing Committee (CSC) meeting held
Wednesday, CSC member Hung Hsiu-chu, who called for Lee's expulsion
for his role in forming the TSU, said "cool treatment" of the Lee
case is no longer tolerable. She demanded that a timetable be set to
carry out Lien's instructions regarding Lee.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MORE THAN 70% BACK OPENING OF DIRECT 'THREE LINKS': POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of the people of Taiwan
support the proposal to open direct trade, mail and transportation
links between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, according to the
results of an opinion poll released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 998 randomly selected adult residents,
conducted by the Open magazine Aug. 20-21, found that more than 70
percent of the respondents threw their support behind the proposal
to open the direct cross-strait "three links."</P>
      <P>The reasons cited by the "three links" proponents included
improving cross-strait relations and increasing job opportunities,
according to the survey.</P>
      <P>In contrast, about 20 percent of those interviewed said they
opposed the "three links" overture out of their worries that the
opening measure could threaten Taiwan's national security and
accelerate capital outflow.</P>
      <P>Nearly 50 percent said they believe that the opening of direct
"three links" would speed up unification of the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait, while 42.4 percent said they think otherwise.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 40 percent thought that mainland China
was the biggest obstacle to implementing the "three links" proposal;
31.2 percent said Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) should take the greatest blame for slow progress in promoting
the open-door policy; and 10.4 percent said Taiwan's opposition
parties should be blamed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 50 percent of survey respondents gave a thumbs-up to
the proposal to ease the "go slow, be patient" policy on mainland
China-bound investment.</P>
      <P>The poll has a margin of error of 3.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Both the "three links" and cross-strait investment curbs
relaxation plans will be further discussed at the Economic
Development Advisory Conference (EDAC) scheduled for Aug. 24-26. So
long as all EDAC delegates can forge consensus on the two
"open-door" measures, the DPP government has promised to implement
them.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKER CRITICIZES OFFICIALS OVER LAVISH OVERSEAS TRIPS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition lawmaker criticized several
senior government officials Wednesday for their alleged spendthrift
lavishness when they go on overseas trips.</P>
      <P>Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung of the opposition People First Party
(PFP) said that despite the government's current financial straits,
some Cabinet officials did not seem to have felt the pinch and have
continued to make expensive overseas visits.</P>
      <P>According to Liu's tallies, Cabinet members have made a total of
127 overseas visits at an accumulated cost of NT$45 million (US$1.3
million) since the inauguration of the Democratic Progressive
Party-led government in May 2000.</P>
      <P>Liu said Chang Fu-mei, minister of the Overseas Chinese Affairs
Commission, topped the "spendthrift" list. "Chang has made 12
overseas trips, with an aggregate travel bill of NT$5.48 million
since she assumed office," Liu claimed.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi ranked second, with six
overseas visits at a total cost of NT$3.92 million; followed by Lee
Ming-liang, minister of the Department of Health, with four visits at
an accumulated cost of NT$2.71 million.</P>
      <P>Liu urged the Cabinet-level Research, Development and Evaluation
Commission to cut the overseas travel budgets for certain ministries
while compiling the government's overall budget plan for fiscal 2002.
"The commission should also carefully assess the results or effects
of overseas visits of senior government officials to avoid wasting
public funds," he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he lauded several senior officials for their
self-restraint in making overseas trips. Those officials included
Premier Chang Chun-hsiung, Vice Premier Lai Ing-jaw, Council of Labor
Affairs Chairwoman Chen Chu and Minister of Justice Chen Ding-nan.</P>
      <P>But Liu accused Minister of Transportation and Communications Yeh
Chu-lan of having spent a large sum of money on clothes during her
just-concluded 10-day trip to the United States and Japan, ostensibly
to inspect tourist facilities and management.</P>
      <P>He also expressed his doubts as to why the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) still had to spend about

    <TEXT>
      <P>The offices of a weekly magazine known for
its paparazzi style of printing stories about local celebrities was
vandalized Wednesday by three men wielding baseball bats.</P>
      <P>The three men, said to be in their twenties, entered the tenth
floor office of Next Magazine via the fire escape stairway and
smashed glass doors and computers. None of the three made any attempt
to conceal their identities.</P>
      <P>They left the office about five minutes later without attacking
any of the staff and a security camera caught the men leaving the
office the same way as they entered and running away on foot.</P>
      <P>Police sources said the vandalism was intended as a warning over
an article in the latest edition of the magazine that alleges a local
gangster is the owner of a local pub.</P>
      <P>The magazine, owned by Hong Kong publisher Jimmy Lai, is known
for its invasive reporting style of public figures, and it has been
defendants in at least three lawsuits since its May 30 launch in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>An editor at the magazine said that he had received threatening
phone calls before Wednesday, but vowed to keep pursuing and

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged Japan
Wednesday to face up to its wartime atrocities and not to gloss over
them.</P>
      <P>"There is but one historic fact, and the objective fact should
not be distorted or altered," Chen told a group of visiting Japanese
education leaders led by Shiro Odamura, head of Takushoku University.</P>
      <P>He also told his guests that senior Japanese leaders should take
into account the feelings of their Asian neighbors before visiting a
controversial shrine dedicated to Japanese war dead, including
several Class-A war criminals.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that Chen had made public comments on the
Japanese textbook issue and on Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro
Koizumi's recent visit to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine.</P>
      <P>On the Japanese history textbook issue, Chen said history books
must honestly record historical facts and should not carry any
distorted descriptions.</P>
      <P>He further said that no one should find any reasons to justify
the launching of a war because no wars can be justified or tolerated.
He was referring to a controversial set of Japanese high school
textbooks which give distorted accounts of Japan's role in World War
II as well as its wartime atrocities in Taiwan, mainland China, South
Korea and other Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Last week, Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi visited the Yasukuni
shrine, which honors 2.5 million war dead since the late 1800s,
including executed war criminals from World War II.</P>
      <P>Chen said he hopes senior Japanese officials will pay more heed
to the feelings of the people of its neighboring countries before
making such visits. He also urged Japan not to try to glorify its
militarist past and instead work harder to promote regional peace,
stability and prosperity.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan people searching for jobs in July
got an average of just 0.4 job offerings, far less than the number of
job opportunities offered in the past, according to recruitment
agency statistics released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The statistics compiled by the human resources databank "104"
show that although the jobs offered in July increased by 2 percent
over June, they were still insufficient for the sharp increase in the
number of on-line job seekers, thus requiring every job seeker to
spend an average of 32 days to find an adequate job, 6.4 days longer
than in June.</P>
      <P>The results of the survey, conducted in early August by the "104"
databank among new graduates, show that 80.7 percent of them had not
yet found a job. Among the new graduates who had not found a job,
30.1 percent of them said the reason was that they did not like the
jobs available, while others blamed the sluggish economy and still
others described themselves as incompetent.</P>
      <P>According to the databank, most of the job openings in July were
in sales, followed by computer systems, software, hardware,
telecommunications, manufacturing, and engineering research and
development.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, officials of the Cabinet-level Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) noted Wednesday that the
number of job seekers registered in government job brokerage
organizations in the first seven months of the year had reached
228,000, an increase of 35.4 percent over the same period of last
year, while the jobs on offer totaled 232,000, a decrease of 23.4
percent over the same period of 2000.</P>
      <P>As a result, every job seeker had an average of 1.02 job
opportunities in the first seven months of the year, compared with an

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's unemployment rate for this year
could be kept under 4.5 percent, since the speed of corporate layoffs
has been slowing down, an economic planner said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lee Kao-chao, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), said that job opportunities
increased in June, as many enterprises anticipate an economic
rebound.</P>
      <P>He also said that if the unemployment rates in July and August do
not exceed 5 percent, the jobless rate for the whole year can be kept
under 4.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that Taiwan suffered a sharp drop in economic growth as
a result of the 1973 energy crisis, when its growth rate of 10
percent slid to near zero, creating a great impact on local
companies. As a result, enterprises had to slash their workforces,
which made unemployment surge.</P>
      <P>However, he added, entrepreneurs were unable to find workers
after the crisis passed. He said this is making present entrepreneurs
maintain a wait-and-see attitude toward their economic prospects and
predicted that they will not lay off too many workers.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  21  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. government is reviewing
long-standing restrictions on contacts with Taiwan officials, a
senior Pentagon official said Monday, apparently suggesting that the
level of communications may be upgraded.</P>
      <P>"There's some cost, I suppose, if you don't have communications
at a high political or military level," said Peter W. Rodman,
assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs.</P>
      <P>For years, colonel or its equivalent is the highest rank at which
the U.S. administration allows contacts with Taiwan officials,
although it has been a practice for a chief of Taiwan's general staff
to come to Washington once during his term for secret meetings with
senior Pentagon officials.</P>
      <P>Speaking to reporters at the Pentagon, Rodman said that he does
not predict any imminent change to the restrictions and nor is the
United States proposing any changes to the basic structure of the
relationship as set forth in the Taiwan Relations Act and
Washington's three joint communiques with Beijing, he said.</P>
      <P>"But we are looking at practical issues in our relations with
Taiwan, both the practical issue of improving our understanding of
each other's thinking and strategic outlook, and also to strengthen
deterrence, which is a clearly stated objective that we have," Rodman
said.</P>
      <P>He said that communication with Taiwan is important. "It doesn't
serve anybody's interest for us and Taiwan not to be able to
communicate on security matters," he said.</P>
      <P>On war games that mainland China's armed forces are conducting
along the southeast coast of the mainland, Rodman pointed out that
they are routine exercises.</P>
      <P>"I'm sure they learned something from it," he said. "But we're
watching them closely and perhaps we can learn something from that
exercise too. But I certainly don't see an imminent threat of a
conflict."</P>
      <P>A former chief of the State Department's policy planning staff,
Rodman was sworn in last month as the senior official responsible for
the Pentagon's security policy for Asia, Latin America and Africa.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will have a clearer idea of whether
it will be allowed to enter the World Trade Organization (WTO) in
October after a WTO working group meeting scheduled for Sept. 14 for
a last review the island's bid, an economics official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Chen Ruey-long said that barring
last-minute glitches, the island's bid will pass the working group
and be remitted for final approval by the WTO ministerial conference
scheduled for October in Qatar.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Beijing's insistence that it must be admitted
to the world trade regulatory body ahead of Taiwan will not derail
the schedule, in light of the fact that Beijing's WTO access is
expected to be approved on the same occasion.</P>
      <P>There should be at least one month separation between the working
group's final meeting and the WTO's approval of the application, in
order to give WTO member states time to review the applicant's
paperwork, said Chen.</P>
      <P>Taiwan wrapped up its bilateral negotiations with WTO members on
the terms of its entry long ago, but has been prevented from sealing
its membership until Beijing has completed its own negotiations.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  22  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP)
will cooperate with whichever party controls the most legislative
seats after the year-end election, despite its "spiritual" attachment
to the Kuomintang, PFP Chairman James Soong said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>However, Soong went on, the PFP will not give up its principles
and stances on some important issues purely for the sake of
cooperation.</P>
      <P>He urged the leaders of Taiwan's ruling and opposition parties to
work out a "gentleman's agreement" on the formation of a coalition
that would command majority support in the legislature and thereby
maintain the stability of the government.</P>
      <P>The former Taiwan provincial governor said it would be preferable
for leaders of the political parties to negotiate the ground rules of
a coalition prior to the election, so that they will not be
influenced by their parties' performance in the election.</P>
      <P>The PFP is in no position to join any coalition before the
election owing to the paltry 17 seats it holds in the 220-seat
legislature, and will determine its strategy as to which party it
will cooperate with according to the number of seats it occupies in
the new legislature after the year-end election, Soong said at a tea
party with local journalists.</P>
      <P>Although the coalition can only be formed after the election, it
would be preferable to have it in place before February -- when the
new legislature is set to meet -- because the stricken economy cannot
wait that long for help, according to Soong.</P>
      <P>He also confirmed that he and Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan will
meet Thursday.</P>
      <P>Soong said they will continue their negotiations on cooperation
in the year-end elections and exchange views on how to stabilize the
government after the Economic Development Advisory Conference (EDAC)
ends Sunday.</P>
      <P>Soong said he owes a definite answer to some PFP members who are
aspiring to run for magistrateships in counties around the island, as
the final window for announcing their candidacy is approaching.</P>
      <P>If there is no chance of the two parties fielding a candidate
supported by both in several critical counties, there is no reason to
keep those PFP hopefuls in agony any more, Soong said.</P>
      <P>Also on their agenda is a discussion of ways to translate the
EDAC conclusions into concrete policy, Soong added.</P>
      <P>As an advisory group, the EDAC's conclusions are not legally
binding before going through the legislative process and that is
where cooperation between parties will come to play, Soong said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC BIOTECH DELEGATION TO VISIT U.S. AND SEEK PARTNERSHIPS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   Aug.  22  (CNA)
(By Herman Y.C. Pan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-level Republic of China
delegation will travel in September to Pennsylvania, New Jersey,
Delaware, Maryland and Virginia for a mid-Atlantic biotechnology
initiative, the U.S.-ROC (Taiwan) Business Council announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The delegation will be led by Shih Yen-shiang , director-general
of the Industrial Development Bureau of the Ministry of Economic
Affairs, to seek partnerships for biotechnology development and
explore investment opportunities.</P>
      <P>"This is a remarkable opportunity for the United States'
biotechnology sector," said Rupert J. Hammond-Chambers, president of
the U.S.-ROC Business Council.</P>
      <P>He said the ROC delegation represents "the core of Taiwan's
emerging biotech community -- senior private sector leaders who have
already enjoyed success, and senior government officials who will
play a proactive role in ensuring that entrepreneurs and businesses
receive the support they need to do business with Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The ROC government recently announced that it is committing
itself to biotech, one of the fastest growing industries in Taiwan.
This commitment is evident in Taiwan's US$1.5 billion appropriation
of government funds for research, development and promotion over the
next five years.</P>
      <P>The delegation will begin with a two-day summit in Philadelphia
hosted by the University of Pennsylvania's School of Medicine and
School of Applied Engineering and organized by the American Institute
in Taiwan and the United States Trade and Development Agency.</P>
      <P>Topics for discussion will include how to integrate Taiwan with a
globalizing U.S. biotechnology industry.</P>
      <P>The delegation will also learn about specific business
opportunities in the United States. Following the summit, the
delegation will tour pharmaceutical and educational research
facilities in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and
Virginia.</P>
      <P>The tour will precede the 25th annual Joint Business Conference
of the U.S.-ROC and ROC-USA Business Councils to be held in Boston,
Sept. 17-19, 2001.</P>
      <P>For the past 25 years, the two councils have hosted the Annual

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN FIRM UNVEILS WORLD'S FIRST DNA-BASED ANTI-COUNTERFEIT CHIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,    Aug.    23   (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The world's first DNA-based
anti-counterfeit chip has been successfully developed by a Taiwan
biotechnology company and is now ready to be mass produced for
commercial applications, the chairman of the company said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The DNA-based anti-counterfeit chip, a combination of
biotechnology and micro-electrical engineering, was unveiled by
Biowell Technology Co. at a news conference Wednesday. Government
officials and representatives from leading business conglomerates in
Taiwan who are potential users of the DNA chip attended the event.</P>
      <P>The DNA chips, with their almost unlimited variations, could be
the best and cheapest device to deter counterfeiting and forgery that
current technologies are unable to detect, according to Dr. Hsu
Chun-chieh, chairman of Biowell and head of its research and
development department. Hsu was formerly a researcher at the Academia
Sinica, Taiwan's top research institute, but left two years ago to
help start Biowell.</P>
      <P>The DNA chips, each with individual DNA developed using
biosynthesis technology developed by Biowell, can be affixed to any
object that needs to be protected from counterfeiting and forgery.</P>
      <P>It can be placed on credit cards, cash cards, membership cards,
ID cards, and electronic door locks and passes.</P>
      <P>It takes only two seconds to identify or detect a card mounted
with the DNA-based anti-counterfeit chip, and the users, such as
stores, do not need to change their machines to enable them to read
cards carrying the DNA-based anti-counterfeit chips. All they need to
do is to add on a portable DNA chip reader to their cash machine, Hsu
noted.</P>
      <P>In addition, the DNA chips are waterproof and resistant to
pressure. Their polymer encasement, which contains a central
processing unit that is one-sixth the size of an adult's fingernail,
protects them from damage. Even strong ultraviolet rays will not harm
the chips, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Currently the company says that the chips are expected to have a
lifespan of only five years, but in the future, when technologies
improve, the chips should last for at least 10 years, he said.</P>
      <P>The end result of biotechnological research should not only be
applied to pharmaceutical products, Hsu said, adding that other
applications could be quite useful if used in consumer goods to help
better the lives of average citizens.</P>
      <P>Currently the company has a monthly production capacity of 2.5
million DNA-based anti-counterfeit chips, which can be tailor-made to
meet different demands from different customers. For example, the DNA
chips that would be used by a credit card issuing company would be
different from that to be used by Pfizer for its Viagra packages, Hsu
said.</P>
      <P>Buyers of each major batch of the DNA chips would have their own
data bases to control and detect the chips to help them find out
whether the DNA chip-mounted cards or products have been
counterfeited, he said.</P>
      <P>While feeling comfortable and confident with the marketing
prospects of the DNA chips, Biowell researchers are planning to
expand their product line -- to develop edible anti-counterfeit
DNA-coated materials and sprays to be used in expensive medicines and
high-priced food products, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIT TAIPEI OFFICE CHIEF NOMINATED NEW U.S. AMBASSADOR TO VIETNAM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  22  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The White House announced Wednesday
that President George W. Bush intends to nominate Raymond Burghardt,
current top U.S. representative to the Republic of China, to be new
U.S. ambassador to Vietnam.</P>
      <P>Burghardt's appointment will require Senate confirmation.
Burghardt, if confirmed, would succeed Douglas Peterson, a former
prisoner of war in Vietnam who came to Hanoi as the first U.S.
post-Vietnam War ambassador to the Indochinese nation in May 1997.</P>
      <P>A career member of the U.S. Senior Foreign Service, Burghardt has
served as director of the Taipei office of the American Institute in
Taiwan (AIT) since 1999. The AIT Taipei office represents U.S.
interests in Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties between
the two countries.</P>
      <P>The White House news release said Burghardt served as principal
officer in Shanghai from 1997 to 1999, deputy chief of mission in
Manila from 1993 to 1996 and deputy chief of mission in Seoul from
1990 to 1993.</P>
      <P>He has also held numerous other positions overseas, including
political officer in Beijing, Tegucigalpa, Hong Kong, Guatemala and
Saigon, the news release said, adding that Burghardt's Washington
assignments included service in a variety of capacities in the Bureau
of East Asian and Pacific Affairs.</P>
      <P>ROC President Chen Shui-bian decorated Burghardt with the Order
of Brilliant Star with Grand Cordon Monday in recognition of his
contribution to promoting substantive Taipei-Washington relations
during his two-year stint as the de facto U.S. ambassador to Taiwan.
The Order symbolizes the highest honor the ROC presents to a foreign
national.</P>
      <P>It remains unclear who will succeed Burghardt as the top U.S.
representative to Taipei. Many China affairs experts in Washington,
D.C. said Douglas Paal, a former senior Asian affairs director with
the White House National Security Council, is the most likely
candidate for the post.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EUROPE CAN PROVIDE MODEL FOR ACADEMIC AND INDUSTRY INTEGRATION: NSC HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 23 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should look to the entrepreneurship
programs of many innovative universities in Europe as a model to
promote interactions between academic circles and industry, Huang
Wen-hsiung, vice chairman of the National Science Council, said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Huang has recently concluded a tour to Europe. He said that
during his visits to several science parks in Europe, he was
impressed to learn about the success of university programs to
support the establishment of spin-off companies.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by the council's director of humanities and social
sciences and director of international programs, Huang visited
Sweden, Finland and Britain in the past two weeks.</P>
      <P>He said that the science parks in Scandinavia are mostly research
and development-oriented, and universities are supporting industrial
companies which usually are small in scale. University professors
offer consultative services to these companies.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan is planning for the establishment of biotechnology
parks, Huang said that Taiwan can learn from the Scandinavian models.</P>
      <P>Many innovative universities in Europe have developed successful
models of collaboration between academic circles and industry, and
these universities in Denmark, Portugal, Spain, Germany, Sweden,
Finland, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and France have formed a
continental-wide network -- the European Consortium of Innovative
Universities.</P>
      <P>Huang said that Taiwan's production-oriented science-based
industrial park is also recognized internationally as a successful
model with an annual production value amounting to US$3 billion.</P>
      <P>Many of the IC (integrated circuits), IT (information technology)
and communications companies based in the Hsinchu Science-based
Industrial Park were spin-offs of the Industrial Technology Research
Institute (ITRI), a national research institute which transfers some
3,000 technologies to companies in various industrial sectors every
year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's hi-tech sectors -- electronics, optoelectronics,
automation, pharmaceuticals, aerospace, energy and environment
protection -- have benefited greatly from ITRI's technology transfer
programs.</P>
      <P>In recent years, leading enterprises in Taiwan are cooperating
with local universities by sponsoring research and development
centers on university campuses. Huang said that the National Science
Council is promoting cooperation programs to encourage professors and
research personnel in universities to offer on-site consultancy to
industrial companies in science parks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP CHAIR WANTS SPEEDY OPENING OF DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT TRAVEL LINKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  23  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chairman of the opposition People First
Party (PFP) James Soong spoke out Thursday in favor of a speedy
opening of direct air and shipping links across the Taiwan Strait --
the first time the party leader has made such a declaration.</P>
      <P>Soong, formerly the provincial governor of Taiwan who defied
Kuomintang party regulations and ran for president in 2000 and
failed, stressed that the PFP is willing to help accelerate direct
cross-strait travel links under the framework of the Republic of
China Constitution.</P>
      <P>Spelling out the PFP's latest policies of seeking stability
across the Taiwan Strait, Soong called for resumption of cross-strait
negotiations based on the National Unification Guidelines and the
"1992 consensus" that allows both sides of the Strait to have
separate interpretations on the "one China" concept.</P>
      <P>Soong added that Taiwan should shelve disputes over the thorny
"unification or independence" issue and begin talks with mainland
Chinese authorities over technical issues to first achieve economic
and functional integration across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He said the major differences across the Taiwan Strait is that
people in Taiwan enjoy systems of freedom and democracy while their
mainland counterparts do not. He said he keenly hopes to enable the
Beijing leadership to understand that Taiwan is more than willing to
seek peaceful unification and long-term political integration, with
the Taiwan population feeling confident about their future.</P>
      <P>As for the PFP, Soong noted that the party would by no means be
obstinate -- instead, it is more than willing to cooperate with any
other party to jointly work out solutions to help stabilize domestic
politics and accelerate cross-strait reconciliation.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's unemployment rate hit a new high
of 4.92 percent in July as a result of global and domestic economic
sluggishness, sources from the Cabinet-level Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>July's soaring jobless rate was the tenth monthly rise in a row
and marked the longest consecutive period of rising unemployment in
Taiwan's history, said Chen Chin-cheng, a DGBAS deputy bureau chief.</P>
      <P>Chen attributed the soaring unemployment rate mainly to the
contraction of Taiwan's job market.</P>
      <P>The number of people who lost their jobs because of business
closings or layoffs in July marked the eleventh consecutive month the
figure has risen. On average, 17,000 more people became unemployed
month-on-month between April and July, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>In July, 480,500 people were out of a job or looking for
employment, an increase of 43,000 from June, marking an unemployment
rate of 4.92 percent, a single-month record, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Increased numbers of newly graduated students pouring into the
job market and former white-collar employees turning to blue-collar
work also contributed to the unemployment rate in July, he said.</P>
      <P>Cumulatively, Taiwan posted an average jobless rate of 4.08
percent in the first seven months of this year, Chen said, adding
that the unemployment rate is expected to hit an average of 4.3
percent for the entire year.</P>
      <P>Chen forecast that the island's jobless rate will break the 5
percent mark in August with no sign of immediate recovery in sight.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the first group of 50 "employment boomers," trained by
the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) to help reinvigorate the sluggish
job situation, hit the market for the first time Thursday.</P>
      <P>The job boomers, said CLA officials, will go out with a "tough
salesman's spirit" to help job seekers to sort out their needs, get
access to useful resources and eventually find work.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AMCHAM URGES TAIWAN TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO CROSS-STRAIT IMPASSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei
(AmCham) urged the Republic of China government Thursday to actively
seek a breakthrough to the deadlocked relations across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>The largest foreign trade association in Taiwan made the call on
the eve of the opening of a much-anticipated national economic
development conference aimed at revitalizing the island's faltering
economy.</P>
      <P>Both incumbent AmCham President Richard Henson and his
predecessor, Paul Cassingham, said they have high expectations for
the Economic Development Advisory Conference scheduled for Aug.
24-26.</P>
      <P>Henson said Taiwan should take advantage of the conference to
craft innovative measures to break the lingering cross-strait limbo
to revive public confidence in Taiwan's economic prospects.</P>
      <P>In his view, Henson said, Taiwan is now at a critical juncture
and needs wisdom and vision to cope with the challenges it faces.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's present economic woes lie in a lack of
public confidence, Henson said he is convinced that boosting
cross-strait trade and economic relations would help enhance consumer
and investor confidence.</P>
      <P>In particular, Henson said, if the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
can open direct trade, mail and transportation links, commonly known
as "three links," in the near future, it would certainly have a
positive impact on Taiwan's economic development.</P>
      <P>For his part, Cassingham said Taiwan should define its own role
under the current wave of economic globalization. As both sides of
the Taiwan Strait will soon be admitted into the World Trade
Organization (WTO), Taiwan should formulate new development
strategies to deal with new challenges following its WTO accession.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Henson suggested that Taiwan allow its low-end
manufacturing and assembling industries to relocate to mainland China
and focus its energy on developing such high value-added services as
resourcing, management, designing, and research and development.</P>
      <P>Henson further said Taiwan should cash in on its strategic
geographic location, management expertise and international trade
experience to sustain its economic growth in the midst of
globalization.</P>
      <P>As the people of Taiwan have forged a consensus on economic and
political reforms, Henson said the ROC government should redouble its
efforts to push for transparency and globalization of its financial
and banking services to attract foreign investors and sharpen its
competitive edge in the global market.</P>

      <P>The business revenue of the Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park in the first half of the year totaled
NT$364.2 billion (US$11.24 billion), a drop of 13 percent compared
with the year-earlier level, according to statistics released
Thursday by the Cabinet-level National Science Council (NSC).</P>
      <P>An official from the industrial park administration attributed
the fall to the global stagnation of the semiconductor and computer
industries.</P>
      <P>However, Yen Tsung-ming, a section chief at the Science-based
Industrial Park Administration under control of the NSC, said that
the communications, precision machine and bio-tech industries grew 25
percent, 21 percent and 47 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>He predicted that the park's whole year revenue will reach NT$800
billion (US$23.4 billion).</P>
      <P>Yen disclosed the statistics at a press conference jointly
sponsored by the NSC and the Science-based Industrial Park
Administration.</P>
      <P>He noted that the park yielded revenue of NT$929.3 billion
(US$27.1 billion) in 2000, a record in its 20-year existence.</P>
      <P>In June, Yen went on, global trading in the semiconductor

      <P>According to a prediction made by the International Semiconductor
Equipment and Material Association, revenue of the global
semiconductor equipment sector will suffer a 35 percent cut, or US$31
billion, the largest cut this years.</P>
      <P>Revenue of the computer and peripherals sector in the year's
first six months totaled NT$86 billion, a decrease of 22 percent
from the year-earlier level. Revenue of the IC industry reached
NT$21.04 billion, a decrease of 15 percent compared with the like

    <TEXT>
      <P>A recent study to
be published Saturday shows that bladder cancer is 23 times more
likely to occur in southwestern Taiwan coastal regions in patients
aged 50-60 than in other areas of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The study was jointly conducted by Chiu Wen-hsiang, director of
the Chih Mei Foundation Medical Center's Department of Urology, and
professors Chen Chien-jen and Hsu Ling-i of National Taiwan
University's Graduate Institute of Epidemiology.</P>
      <P>Chiu said that the study focused on the villages located at the
mouth of Pachang River in Tainan County, where many residents have
been drinking underground water over a long period of time,
accumulating large quantities of arsenic in their bodies.</P>
      <P>He added that many of the residents in these villages are also
afflicted with the "blackfoot disease," an endemic form of vascular
thrombosis.</P>
      <P>According to the study, the occurrence of bladder cancer in the
same region was already 20 times that of other regions 10 years ago.</P>
      <P>During these 10 years, the occurrence of bladder cancer in these
coastal villages has gone up by 30 percent for women and 15 percent

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will attend the
plenary session of the Economic Development Advisory Conference
(EDAC), slated to be held Aug. 24-26, his chief of staff said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun said Chen has
managed to take the three-day session into his schedule to underline
the emphasis he places on the conference, which he himself ordered to
be set up.</P>
      <P>In addition to the discussion, Chen will also preside over the
plenary session's opening and closing ceremonies, as well as a
post-conference news briefing Aug. 26, barring unforeseen
emergencies, Yu went on.</P>
      <P>The five preliminary EDAC panels have put forward 314 consensus,
38 majority opinions and 39 other opinions, all of which will be
discussed in the plenary session, Yu continued.</P>
      <P>Instead of resolving the issues through voting, the meeting will
come up with consensus, which will be non-binding, although Chen has
promised to abide by the consensus reached to the best of his
ability.</P>
      <P>In order to translate the conference's conclusions into
government policy, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung ordered Wednesday the
related government agencies to list the current regulations that will
have to be revised or the new regulations that will need to be
enacted in order to implement the conclusions.</P>
      <P>Unless the conference demands otherwise, Chang said, the list
should be presented to his office by Sept. 3 for Cabinet approval by
Sept. 13 and remittance to the legislature by Sept. 18.</P>
      <P>Chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development
Chen Po-chih said Thursday that his council has been charged by Chang
to monitor the implementation of the conference's conclusions every
week and to report its progress to EDAC members every quarter.</P>
      <P>As to the extra budget, estimated at about NT$100 billion
(US$2.94 billion), that would be required to put the 18 conference
proposals into action, Yu said the government will present a
financial feasibility study about the proposals to the conference at
the plenary session, but claimed that the government will be in "no
position to reject them."</P>
      <P>Chen said the government might raise the money through the
privatization of state-run enterprises, or else might raise the cap
on government loans.</P>
      <P>He noted that there is room for the cap on government loans -- 30
percent of the government's whole year budget -- given the 60 percent
cap in "all developed countries."</P>

    <HEADLINE>`GO SLOW' POLICY ADJUSTMENT WILL NOT AFFECT DIPLOMATIC WORK: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Tien Hung-mao
said Thursday that the government's plan to ease the "go slow, be
patient" policy on mainland China-bound investment will not affect
the nation's diplomatic work.</P>
      <P>Tien was responding to press reports that some of the Republic of
China's diplomatic allies have told relevant ROC government
authorities that they will step up efforts to tap the mainland
Chinese market once Taiwan eases its curbs on investment across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He noted that the reports are not new and that congressmen and
parliamentarians from some countries that recognize the ROC have paid
visits to mainland China in recent years.</P>
      <P>Tien said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has consistently
worked very hard to maintain cordial relations with ROC allies.</P>
      <P>"Nevertheless, in the face of the changing global environment, we
can no longer ask our allies to avoid any contact with mainland
China," Tien said, adding that MOFA should still ask ROC diplomatic
allies to minimize their engagements with the mainland.</P>
      <P>Noting that relations with other countries involve wide-ranging
aspects, Tien said mainland visits by parliamentarians will not be
enough to easily turn the tables.</P>
      <P>In his view, Tien said, long-term friendships between top leaders
of the ROC and its allies are critical to sustained bilateral
diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Tien went on to say that the government's planned relaxation of
the "go slow" cross-strait investment policy may add new perspectives
to Taiwan's diplomatic work.</P>
      <P>To cope with all possible new challenges, Tien said, MOFA staff
will exercise even more prudence and caution in handling relations
with ROC allies.</P>
      <P>Tien further said he has ordered relevant MOFA officials to
evaluate the possible impact of easing cross-strait investment
restrictions on the ROC's diplomatic relations with its allies.
"We'll heighten alert, identify core problems and make necessary
adjustments of our strategies to cement relations with our allies and
address issues that may arise in the wake of the relaxation of
mainland investment curbs," he added.</P>
      <P>Tien was speaking after a luncheon he hosted in honor of a
visiting U.S. congressional delegation led by House International
Relations Committee Chairman Henry Hyde.</P>
      <P>Tien said he exchanged views with Hyde on a broad range of
matters of mutual concern during the lunch meeting.</P>
      <P>He said the ROC has consistently maintained close friendly ties
with the two main U.S. parties -- the Republican Party and the
Democratic Party. "Our cordial relationships with both parties will
never change," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Hyde, a Republican from Illinois, and his 34-member delegation
arrived in Taipei Wednesday for a three-day visit.</P>
      <P>This is Hyde's first trip to the Asian-Pacific region since he
took the post as head of House International Committee in January and
his first visit to Taiwan since the Republic of China and the United
States severed their diplomatic relations in 1979.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Republic of China Army OH-58D Kiowa
Warrior helicopter crashed during a routine training flight in
northwestern Taiwan early Thursday, killing the pilot and injuring
the co-pilot.</P>
      <P>An army spokesman said that Maj. Chen Yao-cheng, 31, was piloting
the reconnaissance helicopter on a training mission with Capt. Wei
Ya-teh, 25, when it crashed into a ditch in hilly terrain in Sanyi
Township at 7:48 a.m.</P>
      <P>Military sources said that Chen and Wei had radioed in a report
of abnormal dashboard instrument readings shortly before the chopper
snagged a high-voltage power line and crashed into the hillside.</P>
      <P>Chen was killed by an impact to his neck, while Wei sustained
multiple fractures and other non-fatal injuries.</P>
      <P>Wei, who has logged 365 flying hours, was reported to be in
stable condition after receiving treatment at a nearby hospital.</P>
      <P>Chen had just celebrated his birthday on Sunday. He is survived

      <P>Col. Chen Ming-tung, staff director for the 602nd Airborne
Brigade -- which only recently won the honor of being a model unit in
the ROC Armed Forces -- said that the pilot of the ill-fated
helicopter was an instructor for the brigade with 1,300 flying hours
under his belt.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the crash was the first of its kind since the
OH-58Ds were incorporated into the army in 1993. He added that the
Army General Headquarters has already established an ad hoc
investigation team to determine the factors that led to the fatal
accident.</P>
      <P>The army bought a total of 26 OH-58D helicopters from the United
States in 1992. Each helicopter cost US$6.7 million.</P>
      <P>Observation helicopters like the Kiowa frequently fly at
extremely low levels, hugging the ground during maneuvers, due to the
special nature of their missions.</P>
      <P>They serve as the eyes and ears of the attack helicopters in the

    <HEADLINE>PRAYER CEREMONY HELD ON ANNIVERSARY OF AUG. 23 ARTILLERY WAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Aug.  23  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Buddhist ceremony was held on the
frontline Republic of China island of Kinmen Thursday to "appease the
souls" of the military and civilian victims of the Aug. 23 Artillery
War that took place over four decades ago.</P>
      <P>Twelve dharma masters from Taiwan's Fuokuangshan Temple led some
300 members of the public, soldiers and veterans in saying Buddhist
prayers that honored the fallen.</P>
      <P>The Artillery War was a key moment in ROC history because the war
made mainland China realize that it did not have the power to invade
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On Aug. 23, 1958 -- nine years after the Chinese communists
forced the Kuomintang government to retreat to Taiwan -- the world
watched in alarm as the Aug. 23 Artillery War broke out in Kinmen,
the nearest ROC territory to the mainland.</P>
      <P>At the crack of dawn, concentrated fire from over 300 artillery
pieces blanketed the tiny island just off the coast of the mainland.
The communists were determined to shell the ROC troops into
submission.</P>
      <P>Artillery shells hammered the ground like torrential rain,
plowing up everything in their path.</P>
      <P>Kinmen was ravaged by more than 57,500 shells in the span of just
two hours.</P>
      <P>Both sides threw their navies and air forces into the fray. On
Aug. 25, the communists set up a blockade of Kinmen and stepped up
their artillery offensive. Kinmen responded with its own
counterattack.</P>
      <P>The two sides traded shots back and forth until Oct. 6, when the
communists announced a cease-fire.</P>
      <P>The official tally put the estimated number of shots fired by the
mainland Chinese at 479,554.</P>
      <P>During the 44-day confrontation, each square kilometer of
Kinmen's landscape was dotted by an unprecedented world record
average of 3,197 shells, which translates into roughly three hits per
square meter.</P>
      <P>The troops on Kinmen were able to force the communists to halt
their bombardments for several reasons, including the high morale on
the part of the garrison forces and the support of the United States,
England, France, the Philippines, Argentina and South Korea.</P>
      <P>The United States and the Republic of China at that time were
still diplomatic allies, and the two shared a mutual defense pact
that proved important at the time of the Aug. 23 Artillery War
because the Seventh Fleet moved into position to prepare for any
possible escalation of the conflict and even began escorting ROC
supply ships.</P>
      <P>In 1960, two years after the Artillery War, the communists began
their artillery onslaughts anew, with the first of two periods of
lesser bombardment. Shelling on alternate days, the mainland
artillery attacks continued until 1978, when a formal declaration to
end the shelling was made.</P>
      <P>After the end of the Aug. 23 Artillery War, the ROC military
crafted several tunnels out of granite cliffs for the use of
mechanized landing ships as well as personnel and vehicle landing
ships to make supply runs to Kinmen.</P>
      <P>The tunnels protected the waterway entry of the ships, allowing
them to carry out their missions despite the persistent bombardments.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CALLS FOR TALKS WITH BEIJING UNDER DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 23 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
told a visiting U.S. congressional delegation Thursday that he has
been pushing for the normalization of Taipei-Beijing relations, but
principles of democracy, parity and peace must be upheld during
bilateral interaction.</P>
      <P>Chen told U.S. House International Relations Committee Chairman
Henry Hyde and his bipartisan delegation that cross-Taiwan Strait
issues must be resolved through dialogue and negotiations.</P>
      <P>However, he added that the will and the right of choice of the 23
million people of Taiwan must be respected in the process,
safeguarding the principle of democracy.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to say that the principle of parity means the
relationship between Taiwan and mainland China must not be that of a
local government and a central government.</P>
      <P>The principle of peace dictates that the mainland should not
resort to the use of force or military intimidation, but should
instead embrace dialogue, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen said that his integration theory, the opening of the "mini
three links," preparations to open Taiwan to mainland tourists and
plans to ease restrictions on Taiwanese investment in mainland China
are all concrete actions that serve to show Taiwan's sincerity in
improving bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>However, he lamented that Beijing has not only failed to respond
kindly to these goodwill gestures, it has even attempted to use
divisive means to affect Taiwan's internal unity and create
cross-strait tension by deploying more missiles across the strait
from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Not only are these actions not conducive to a breakthrough in the
current impasse in bilateral ties, he continued, they run against
global expectations of a peaceful resolution to cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>Chen reiterated that the issues must be resolved in accordance
with the principles of the ROC Constitution.</P>
      <P>Only then can bilateral differences be resolved, and only then
can the government and people of both sides of the strait determine
the content and meaning of a mutually acceptable "one China," he
added.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the ROC government will not give up any possible
opportunity that would be helpful to restarting bilateral dialogue
and reconciliation.</P>
      <P>He reaffirmed his willingness to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum's Shanghai summit in October, adding that it could
provide the occasion for the leaders of both sides of the strait to
meet, shake hands and talk.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the summit could set the stage for and be
the bridge to the resumption of bilateral dialogue and that the ROC
government will not have any predetermined stance or set any limits
to possible issues of discussion.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed that "a lack of confidence" is the reason that the
leaders in Beijing will not talk to Taiwan, but he added that he will
continue to rely on wisdom, innovation and patience while waiting for
the "stubborn rock" to give the nod.</P>
      <P>Hyde later called on former ROC President Lee Teng-hui for a
closed door meeting. They reportedly exchanged opinions on Taiwan's
current political situation and the state of ROC-U.S. relations.</P>
      <P>ROC Minister of Foreign Affairs Tien Hung-mao said during a lunch
banquet held in Hyde's honor that the ROC government has always
shared friendly ties with both the U.S. Republican and Democratic
parties, and that such ties will remain cordial in the future.</P>
      <P>Hyde's 34-member delegation includes Rep. Michael Bilirakis, a
Republican from Florida; Paul Gillmor, an Ohio Republican; Mel Watt,
a Democrat from North Carolina; and Darrell Issa, a California
Democrat.</P>
      <P>This is the first trip for Hyde -- a Republican from Illinois --
to the Asia Pacific region since he took the post of House
International Relations Committee chairman in January. This is also
his first visit to Taiwan since the ROC and the United States severed
diplomatic relations in 1979.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong expressed disappointment Thursday that the
Kuomintang cannot publicly endorse any PFP candidates in the year-end
county chief elections.</P>
      <P>"To my great disappointment and regret, the KMT cannot support
any PFP candidates in any of the 21 counties and cities around the
island, owing to difficulties of its own." said Soong, without
elaborating.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks after a two-hour meeting with KMT Chairman
Lien Chan in a last-ditch effort to work out plans to field joint
candidates.</P>
      <P>The two parties had planned to throw their weight behind a single
candidate in at least six crucial counties to increase their chances
of winning.</P>
      <P>Lien took the impasse in his stride, saying that difficulties are
inherent in cooperation between parties in local elections. According
to Lien, of greater account is the determination on the part of both
parties to set up a mechanism for cooperation.</P>
      <P>Although the cooperation is on the verge of collapse, Lien said
his party will not give up efforts to sort out its differences with
the PFP.</P>
      <P>Both Lien and Soong said in a joint statement released after
their meeting that their disagreement would not deter them from
working together on other issues.</P>
      <P>They reconfirmed their parties' commitment to support whatever
consensus emerges from the upcoming Economic Development Advisory
Conference (EDAC).</P>
      <P>According to the statement, Soong supported Lien's idea of
calling for negotiations among different political parties to work
out rules on the formation of a coalition government after the
legislative election also scheduled for the year-end.</P>
      <P>In a press conference later in the day at the KMT headquarters,
Lien called on President Chen Shui-bian not to hog the right of
forming a Cabinet, but rather follow the Constitution and ask
whichever party enjoys the majority or can strike up an alliance with
majority support at the legislature to form the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>He also said his party will set forth "ten proposals" and make a
pitch for "three reforms" at the EDAC plenary session to be opened
Friday.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung urged Belorussia
to set up a representative office in Taipei Thursday while receiving
a group of visitors from Minsk.</P>
      <P>Chang told Belarus First Vice Minister of Finance Rumus F.
Nikolai that Taipei looks forward to Minsk living up to a 1996
protocol with Taipei to open an office in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Taipei's representative office in Minsk was inaugurated July 1,
1996, six months after the protocol was concluded, and the Republic
of China extended a US$35 million loan to Belarus.</P>
      <P>Rumus expressed thanks for the ROC aid to his country in the last
five years and asked for new loans to help the cash-strapped country.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 took
a heavy toll on the defense industry, which used to be the economic
lifeline of the republic.</P>
      <P>He also said that the country is forced to earmark almost 10
percent of its gross national product every year to pay for
decontamination of the radioactive fallout from the 1986 Chernobyl
nuclear disaster.</P>
      <P>He urged Taiwan to keep providing aid to his country to help bail
it out of the economic crisis.</P>
      <P>Rumus previously visited Taiwan in 1996, when he took part in the
negotiations on the exchange of representative offices.</P>

      <P>The National Coast Guard Administration
(NCGA) is making efforts to establish an air reconnaissance force to
further strengthen its patrol and rescue missions, NCGA Administrator
Wang Chun said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wang said at a regular press conference that the Executive Yuan

      <P>Wang said that as the NCGA has to patrol very large areas and
also handle marine ecology protection and disaster rescue, it does
not have nearly enough patrol boats, which makes the formation of an
air arm all the more important.</P>
      <P>He added that night flying will be the priority training item for
the pilots of the air reconnaissance force.</P>
      <P>Wang also said that the NCGA will hold a joint air-land-sea drill

      <P>Bush said during the ceremony that the agreement clarifies and
updates Taiwan's commitments under the WTO GPA and addresses U.S.
bilateral market concerns in this specific area.</P>
      <P>He said this agreement has turned a "lose-lose" situation into a
"win-win" one, adding that Taiwan will also benefit from enhanced
access to the U.S. government procurement market by virtue of its
anticipated accession to the WTO GPA in the near future.</P>
      <P>Chen said the agreement addresses the concerns of the U.S. and,
most importantly, demonstrates Taiwan's efforts to liberalize the
government procurement market.</P>
      <P>According to U.S. official estimates, Taiwan's commitments cover
over US$15 billion over the next 10 years in infrastructure projects
and procurement of a wide range of other goods and services.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Fortune magazine announced Wednesday that
Bill Powell, its bureau chief in Beijing, will write a weekly
column which will appear on the Fortune Web site -- www.fortune.com.</P>
      <P>Titled "China Diary," the column will not only focus on
economics and business in mainland China, but will take a
wide-ranging look at a variety of subjects pertaining to that
area and Asia in general, covering the gamut of contemporary culture,
history and politics.</P>
      <P>In his debut column, "Japan or China? It ain't easy," currently
available on the Web site, Powell looks at how China and Japan are
becoming more integrated economically than they have ever been in the
postwar era. "Yet at the same time," says Powell, "that integration
is contributing significantly to a marked increase in tension between
these two. That tension is deeply rooted, extends well beyond
economics, and isn't going away anytime soon."</P>
      <P>"China Diary" is a strong addition to Fortune's roster of online
columns, including Andy Serwer's "Street Life" and Justin Fox's
"London Calling," said Fortune international editor Robert Friedman.
"This is part of our ongoing commitment to international business
news coverage, in addition to what we cover in the magazine every two
weeks."</P>
      <P>Powell joined Fortune in July 2000. Previously, he was at
Newsweek, where he worked in a number of foreign bureaus, including
Moscow, Berlin and Tokyo, in addition to working in the New York

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN OFFICIATES AT ECONOMIC ADVISORY CONFERENCE OPENING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 24 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian officiated at the
opening of the plenary session of the much-anticipated Economic
Development Advisory Conference Friday, a series of meetings and
discussions designed to invigorate Taiwan's floundering economy.</P>
      <P>Addressing participants at the opening ceremony, Chen vowed to
use the conference as a vehicle to chart a new direction for Taiwan
that takes into account both economic development and social justice.
Chen said that Taiwan stands at a historically critical juncture and
is at the beginning of the second phase of a program he advocated
last year he termed, "The third way for Taiwan: a new political
perspective."</P>
      <P>Chen said the nation "will not be defeated by recession as long
as we retain our courage to conquer adversities," adding that "for
our country we have no right to be pessimistic, but only have
inescapable duties and responsibilities."</P>
      <P>The president reiterated that consensus of opinions and
suggestions that are reached during the conference, albeit
non-binding, should be carried out by all ministerial-level officials
and Cabinet-level agencies.</P>
      <P>He said that conclusions regarding policies would be addressed
immediately following the end of the conference.</P>
      <P>Chen assured the nation that the administration will carry out
the recommendations of the participants of the conference to the best
of its ability with "three determinations, an integrated
implementation program and a guarantee."</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that the administration is determined to put
Taiwan, the economy and the investment climate as priorities on the
list of policy implementation; determined to reconcile differences
between the administration and the Legislature; and determined to
better cooperation between the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
and opposition parties. The president also said that he would not
attach preconditions or bottomlines to the implementation of the
conclusions reached during the conference.</P>
      <P>The five preliminary conference panels have put forward 314
consensus opinions, 38 majority opinions and 39 other proposals, all
of which will be discussed during the Aug. 24-26 plenary sessions,
according to Presidential Office Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun.</P>
      <P>President Chen will take part in the three-day session to
underline the emphasis he places on the conference, which he himself
ordered to convene, Yu said.</P>
      <P>In addition to the discussions, Chen will also preside over the
plenary session closing ceremony, as well as a post-conference news
briefing Aug. 26, barring unforeseen emergencies, Yu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BROKERAGE HOUSES FEELING THE HEAT FROM ASIAN MELTDOWN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Aug.  23 (CNA)
(By David Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The brokerage industry's downsizing in
Asia is another sign of the region's economic slump, and Asia's
economies will be the big losers, Asiaweek magazine reports in its
current issue.</P>
      <P>What's worse, according to senior editor Tim Healy of the Hong
Kong-based magazine, there's little prospect for a rebound. The big
Western banks that rushed into Asia, looking for big returns in risky
emerging markets, have finally lost patience, he adds.</P>
      <P>Asiaweek finds that while the most immediate reasons for the cuts
can be linked to sluggish markets and lower stock trading volume,
more general investor flight from emerging markets is the real
problem.</P>
      <P>Asia is no longer seen as a sure bet, the magazine warns. It
quotes Chia Teck Yew with PricewaterhouseCoopers in Singapore as
claiming that international banks "no longer look at Asia as a place
where they can make money," and are returning to the more stable
markets in the West.</P>
      <P>The constant flow of new lay-off announcements from blue-chip
financial institutions such as Credit Suisse First Boston, Prudential
Securities and J.P. Morgan represents "wrenching structural changes,"
according to Healy. The real crux of the situation is that "some of
the lost jobs currently twirling down the drain won't come back."</P>
      <P>The brokerage houses that didn't reap the fruits of the
traditional model of "greater risk, greater reward" in Asia are
leaving in droves, Asiaweek says, adding that brokerage houses around
the region are shrinking and that every major city is feeling the
pinch.</P>
      <P>Investment banks in Asia, which probably employed more than
100,000 people four years ago, have slashed their workforce by as
much as one-quarter, it says. A prime example is Jakarta, where the
16 foreign brokerages during that time have shrunk to five this year,
with two more on the way out.</P>

    <HEADLINE>UNEMPLOYMENT INFECTS URBAN AREAS AND HI-TECH INDUSTRIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 24 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Newly released unemployment statistics show
that jobless rates are continuing to rise in urban areas and those
affected include not only workers in traditional industries but also
white-collar employees in the hi-tech sector.</P>
      <P>The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS) reported Thursday that Taiwan's unemployed population reached
485,000 at the end of July, with the jobless rate at 4.92 percent.</P>
      <P>The jobless rate has been on the rise for 10 consecutive months
and officials say more employed people are likely to lose their jobs
in the coming months because layoffs are becoming more commonplace in
traditional industries as well as in the hi-tech sector due to the
economic recession.</P>
      <P>Hi-tech companies in the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park
have laid off or pensioned more than 4,000 workers since early this
year. Sluggish business performance suffered by many industrial
companies in the park has had an effect on satellite factories of
these companies in neighboring areas.</P>
      <P>The jobless rate in Hsinchu City in July was 4.82 percent and
that of Hsinchu County was 4.19 percent, according to government
statistics.</P>
      <P>At the end of June, there were 305 industrial companies based in
the Hsinchu industrial park, with seven new establishments to begin
operations soon. There are 101,511 employees at these companies, a
decrease of 1,330 from last year's level. According to a DGBAS
official, more factories but fewer workers seems to indicate that
companies are trying to cut down on personnel expenses.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung city and county, which houses most of the traditional
industries such as petrochemicals, iron, steel and cement, continue
to lead the list of areas with high unemployment rates. The jobless
rate in Kaohsiung City in July was 5.31 percent; Kaohsiung County
stood at 5.15 percent.</P>
      <P>However, as more employees of the hi-tech sector and service
industries have lost their jobs in the past months, the problem of
urban unemployment is surging, the official said.</P>
      <P>In July, the jobless rates in Taipei County, Keelung City and
Ilan County surrounding metropolitan Taipei all exceeded 5 percent.
Many residents in Taipei's neighboring counties are commuters working
in Taipei. Urban unemployment is a problem shared by the neighboring
regions, he added.</P>
      <P>He said that prospects of an improved job market are not good and
the jobless rate in August may surpass 5 percent. In April, there
were 124 job opportunities for every 100 persons. In July, however,
the ratio fell to 73 openings for every 100 persons, according the
official.</P>
      <P>What worries authorities is that an increasing number of
unemployed workers are the primary wage earner for their family.
Although there are an estimated 485,000 people out of work, nearly
1.16 million have been affected because the person that they had
relied on for financial support had been made redundant, the official
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIC CONFERENCE PANEL PRESENTS 'INDUSTRIAL COMPETITIVENESS' PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A preparatory panel under the ongoing
Economic Development Advisory Conference unveiled a 10-point program
Friday on upgrading Taiwan's industrial competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Addressing a conference plenary session, Vice Premier Lai
Ing-jaw, also a co-convener of the industrial competitiveness panel,
said the panel had held seven seminars between July 22 and Aug. 13 to
discuss a number of issues related to the transformation of
traditional industries and the upgrading of their competitiveness.</P>
      <P>"All panel members have agreed on major reform principles and
come up with many concrete proposals," Lai said, adding that some
panelists have also presented special opinions on certain reform
issues.</P>
      <P>Lai said the panel had extensive discussions on measures to
enhance competitiveness of various traditional and high-tech
industries, promote research and development, expand the high-tech
talent pool, boost the development of the knowledge-based economy,
revise corporate management statutes and upgrade agricultural
technologies and management in preparation for Taiwan's imminent
accession to the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>Lai further outlined the consensus reached by all panelists,
including offering incentives to attract more foreign and mainland
Chinese professionals to work in Taiwan; allowing more conscripts to
work at private high-tech companies as an alternative to compulsory
military services; and easing restrictions on issuing corporate bonds
and the public listing of venture capital firms.</P>
      <P>The panel also forged a consensus on the need to integrate the
resources of the government, academic and industrial circles to
establish a new research and development mechanism, revise the
existing corporate law to facilitate mergers and acquisitions, open a
single-stop service counter to offer convenient business information
services, develop recreational agriculture and fishery industries to
buoy economic development in rural areas and promote strategic
agricultural alliances to uplift operational efficiency and
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>All the consensuses, resolutions and proposals presented by the
panel were to be discussed at the plenary session of the three-day
conference, which opened Friday.</P>
      <P>The much-anticipated conference will focus on proposals presented
by the industrial competitiveness and investment climate panels on
its first day.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, discussions will be centered around proposals
presented by the financial reform and employment panels. The final
day of the meeting will focus on proposals initiated by the panel in
charge of affairs related to relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian, who concurrently serves as chairman of
the 120-member conference, has pledged to fully implement suggestions
that have been fully agreed to by all participants.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A majority of married couples in Taiwan are
not happy and most of them do not think that their marriages are
right, results of a recent poll show.</P>
      <P>Conducted by the Taipei Christian Academy just days before the
first Chinese Valentine's Day of the 21st century, the survey
questioned married adults islandwide. The academy found that 93
percent felt unhappy in marriage and 90 percent did not think they
made the right decision to get married. The survey also showed that
90 percent do not feel right about their marriage.</P>
      <P>A total of 88 percent of the respondents felt that their spouses
do not dote on them or do not love them dearly enough and only 16.3
percent of them consider themselves happier now than before they got
married, the survey found.</P>
      <P>The survey also showed that 67 percent of the respondents think
their spouses are garrulous or complaining, and 53 percent of them
worry that their spouses may have had or are having an extramarital
affair.</P>
      <P>Less than one-third of the respondents say their spouses
understand their feelings and thoughts and only 26.2 percent say they
could share secrets with their spouses, according to the poll.</P>
      <P>Chang Kun-chih, director of the academy, a charitable
organization committed to social welfare, said Taiwan's marital
relationships need repair as the number of marriages is falling while
the divorce rate is climbing.</P>
      <P>Chang quoted tallies compiled by the Ministry of the Interior as
indicating that marriages in Taiwan fell year-on-year to a low in
1998 where only an average of 6.69 people in every thousand got
married.</P>
      <P>In 2000, according to the tallies, 180,000 couples married while
50,000 couples ended their relationship with divorce -- an annual
rise of 6.4 percent in the number of people seeking divorce in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Christian Academy conducted the recent poll via family
education and consultation centers islandwide which obtained 368
valid questionnaires for the survey.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLL FINDS 58% BACK OPENING OF DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT '3 LINKS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A majority of the people of Taiwan support
the proposal to open direct trade, mail and transportation links
across the Taiwan Strait, more commonly known as "three links,"
according to the results of an opinion poll released Friday.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 1,069 randomly chosen adult residents,
conducted by the 21st Century Foundation Aug. 9, found that 57.8
percent of the respondents gave a thumbs-up to the proposal to open
direct cross-strait "three links." Only 19.3 percent said they
oppose the proposal.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 31.7 percent said they feel that the
current Democratic Progressive Party-led administration's reluctance
to open direct "three links" mainly results from its pro-independence
ideology, while 22.1 percent said they think that the government's
main consideration should be its worries about Taiwan's increasing
economic reliance on mainland China.</P>
      <P>Asked if the government fails to make a resolution on opening
direct "three links" in the near future, 27.2 percent said they
support the proposal to hold a plebiscite to decide whether the new
opening measure should be implemented, but 45.8 percent gave a
thumbs-down to the "referendum" proposal.</P>
      <P>If the government continues to drag its foot on opening direct
"three links," 35.3 percent said the Legislative Yuan should be
authorized to make a decision; 20.2 percent said cross-party
consultations should be held to discuss the issue; and only 7.5
percent said the current Economic Development Advisory Conference
should be authorized to address the issue.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the survey findings, Lin Yu-fang, an opposition People
First Party candidate for the year-end legislative elections, said
opening direct cross-strait "three links" complies with Taiwan's
general public opinion.</P>
      <P>Lin said some pro-independence diehards' opposition to any
proposal to expand cross-strait commercial exchanges apparently
violates prevailing public opinion.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Wang Chung-yu, former chairman of the China
Steel Corp., said Friday at the Economic Development Advisory
Conference that the government should help Taiwan's traditional
industries develop international marketing channels and ease their
tax burden.</P>
      <P>At the panel discussions on improving the competitiveness of
traditional industries, Wang said that traditional industries used to
be Taiwan's principle industries. In recent years, however,
comparatively higher labor costs and land prices have driven up the
production costs of Taiwan's traditional industries and weakened
their competitiveness.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, Taiwan's manufacturing industries have been
weak in streamlining their overseas sales channels. He suggested that
the government play an active role in helping manufacturers develop
international marketing networks.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lai Shyh-bao supported Wang's viewpoint, saying that
Taiwan's traditional industries should put more emphasis on marketing
and logistics to improve their competitiveness.</P>
      <P>In the past years, Taiwan's traditional industries have sought to
move their production facilities to Southeast Asia or mainland China
where the personnel as operational costs are much lower than those in
Taiwan. Legislator Chu Li-lung said that the government should face
the reality of business migration and design practices to regulate
it.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese people -- even those not
necessarily seriously ill -- believe so much in the efficacy of IVs
that they consumed some 33.6 million bottles of IV fluid last year,
mainly to "regain their strength."</P>
      <P>Those 33.6 million bottles cost the nation NT$1.1 billion
(US$31.88 million) in National Health Insurance bills, Huang Fu-yuan,
deputy director-general of the Cabinet-level Department of Health
(DOH), said Friday.</P>
      <P>Huang quoted a recent DOH survey as indicating that about half of
the local people who responded to the survey believe that a cold or a
dose of 'flu will not be cured unless medicine and injections are
administered by doctors.</P>
      <P>The DOH survey also found that some 10.12 percent of the
population do not think rest and drinking lots of water will help
strengthen immunity against disease.</P>
      <P>According to another recent survey conducted by the National
Health Insurance Bureau (NHIB), county hospitals administer the most
IVs -- administering 22.75 percent of their patients with an IV --
followed by local-level clinics, with an IV administration rate of
11.35 percent.</P>
      <P>Medical centers islandwide have the lowest IV administration
rate, but still at a relatively high rate of 6 percent as compared

most likely to request IV treatment when they go to the doctor. In
southern Taiwan, some hospitals and clinics have even opened an "IV
Zone" exclusively for patients receiving IV treatment, he added.</P>
      <P>Huang called for the Taiwan public not to become "addicted" to
IVs, particularly at a time when the economy is contracting, as it
costs about NT$500-700 for each bottle of IV liquid, even though the
fluid -- usually saline or glucose -- is cheaper than a sports drink
to prepare.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that eating two bowls of rice would provide the
same benefits as a 500cc IV of glucose.</P>
      <P>He said he is even more disapproving of those people who talk,
walk around and even shop in the hospital complex trailing their IV
racks around with them.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Aug.  24  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As Taiwan is preparing to open up to
tourists from mainland China in January 2002, travel businesses
islandwide have decided to set up a joint federation in September to
handle relevant issues, industry sources said Friday.</P>
      <P>Wu Pao-shun, chairman of the Kaohsiung Travel Association, said
at a news conference that it was decided in a meeting with industry
representatives from across the island the previous evening that a
joint federation for the local industry will be established Sept. 17
in a move to prepare for the opening up to mainland tourists.</P>
      <P>The planned federation will serve as a "counter" in cross-Taiwan
Strait travel exchanges and take charge of transferring applications
by mainland tourists to the relevant government authorities, Wu said,
adding that the mainland side has also started similar preparations.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, around 300 local travel agencies are qualified
to deal with mainland tourist package tours following initial
screening by the government, with 50 of them based in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>He noted that the first group of mainland tourists is expected to
be given permission to travel to Taiwan in January at the earliest
and that applying for a Taiwan entry permit will take around five
days for mainland visitors.</P>
      <P>Based on government assessments, as many as 365,000 mainland
tourists will be allowed to visit Taiwan per year, a situation which
it is estimated will help create 200,000 job opportunities in related
businesses worth more than NT$100 billion (US$2.9 billion) annually,
he added.</P>

(By Oscar Chung and Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Congress of Guatemala
passed a resolution Aug. 21 to show support of the Republic of
China's entry to United Nations and other international
organizations.</P>
      <P>The resolution notes that the ROC, established in 1912, is the
first democracy in Asia and one of the U.N. founders.</P>
      <P>However, the resolution adds, Taiwan's 23 million people have
been excluded from participation in international issues regarding
public health, education, environmental protection and cultural
affairs during the past 30 years because of Resolution No. 2758,
which gave the ROC's seat in the U.N. to mainland China.</P>
      <P>The resolution emphasizes that the ROC is a sovereign country
that pursues democracy and peace and can serve as example to all
developing countries. However, the ROC's exclusion from the U.N. and
its affiliate - the World Health Organization - deprives Taiwan's
people the opportunity to participate in international quarantine
efforts.</P>
      <P>Despite this, the resolution adds, Taiwan still offers technology
and capital to help developing countries in public health promotion.</P>
      <P>Guatemalan congressmen said they firmly support the return of ROC

      <P>The congressmen also urged other Central American countries to

      <P>A Taiwan-Japan Parliamentarians Amity
Alliance was formally established Friday to help promote economic and
cultural relations between the Republic of China and Japan.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Chung-mo of the ruling Democratic Progressive

      <P>The alliance's Japanese counterpart -- the Japan-Taiwan
Parliamentarians Amity Federation initiated by parliamentarians of
Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) -- was founded in May.</P>
      <P>The alliance will also try to push the governments of the two
countries to jointly safeguard the Asian-Pacific regional peace and
security, Lin said in a speech at the founding ceremony.</P>
      <P>Lin and Koki Kobayashi, chairman of the Japan-Taiwan

that the main purpose of the organizations is to promote closer
relations between Taiwan and Japan.</P>
      <P>Vice Foreign Minister Wu Tzu-dan said that the ROC and Japan

    <HEADLINE>VIOLENT BREAK-UPS RAMPANT AMONG LOCAL LOVERS: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 254 cases of violence arising
from lovers' break-ups were reported in Taiwan between the beginning
of 2000 and the end of July this year, according to a study released
Friday by the Awakening Foundation.</P>
      <P>"The number could be translated into an average of one violent
break-up of lovers every two days," said Chen Chun-fen, director of
the non-profit foundation's research department.</P>
      <P>Chen said the foundation's study also found that three cases of
death involving lovers' break-ups were reported per month during the
period and that one case of love affair-related suicide was reported
every two weeks.</P>
      <P>Of the 57 cases of homicide following break-ups, women accounted
for about 80 percent of the victims, Chen said, adding that the
foundation based its study on reports collected from databanks of two
local major newspapers -- the China Times and the United Daily News.</P>
      <P>Chen said that as the National Police Administration has not
compiled relevant data, the actual number of cases should be higher
than the figures provided by the foundation.</P>
      <P>The forms of violence used in the cases studied by the foundation
included rape, beating, inflicting injury, intimidation or emotional
blackmail, and murder, Chen said.</P>
      <P>In 24 cases, Chen said, the women involved had nude pictures or
videotapes taken of them without their consent.</P>
      <P>The study further showed that the numbers of men and women who
committed suicide over a conflict or break-up with their lovers
during the period were roughly equal, Chen said, adding that suicide
over soured love affairs usually resulted from a lack of extensive
social support networks.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the study found that women were more prone than their
male counterparts to fall victim to violence resulting from lovers'
break-ups, with a ratio of three to one. Moreover, about 60 percent
of the attackers in cases with male victims were men.</P>
      <P>The study also found that retaliatory measures taken by
embittered lovers have become more likely to offend public safety,
including arson and throwing Molotov cocktails or home-made bombs.
Seven such dangerous cases were reported in 2000 and the number
increased to nine in the first seven months of this year.</P>
      <P>Chen said the foundation unveiled its study on the eve of Chinese
Valentine's Day with a view to promoting the development of a new
"love culture" that favors peaceful break-ups after love turns sour.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting U.S. House International Relations
Committee Chairman Henry J. Hyde said Friday that the United States
must publicly state that it will never allow Beijing to subvert or
destroy "the world's only functioning Chinese democracy" in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At a lunch meeting of the Chinese National Association of
Industry and Commerce, Hyde told a group of local political leaders
and scholars, as well as foreign diplomats, that "instead of backing
away from Taiwan," the United States should hold the island's
democracy up as an inspiring example to mainland China.</P>
      <P>The Illinois Republican praised Taiwan for the "historic
accomplishment" of having the first-ever democratically elected
government in five millennia of recorded Chinese history in 1996, and
for the first peaceful transfer of political power from one party to
another last year.</P>
      <P>Hyde said: "Elections are rare enough in this world, but peaceful
transfers of power are rarer still and are the indisputable mark of
the establishment of a genuine democracy and political freedom."</P>
      <P>He went on to say that democracy brings with it a "dynamism" that
is sometimes mistaken as instability. He called the political
realignments currently taking place in Taiwan "a sign of strength, an
indication that change and adaptation are possible, that the
political system is responding to the ever-changing demands of
society."</P>
      <P>Hyde said that Taiwan's economic success is essential in
convincing Beijing that a Western, market-oriented economic model
would work in mainland China. He called for increasing economic links
and dialogue across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He also criticized the Beijing government for apparently being
determined to bring about Taiwan's subordination and seemingly
willing to risk an armed confrontation to achieve that end.</P>
      <P>However, he suggested that the United States should not break its
ties with Beijing or impose any sanctions, but should instead
continue to deepen bilateral economic ties and convince the Chinese
people that an authoritarian regime is destined to fade.</P>
      <P>The United States must help mainland China to become fully
integrated into the world, he added.</P>
      <P>Hyde's 34-member delegation includes Rep. Michael Bilirakis, a
Republican from Florida; Paul Gillmor, an Ohio Republican; Mel Watt,
a Democrat from North Carolina; and Darrell Issa, a California
Democrat.</P>
      <P>This is the first trip for Hyde to the Asia Pacific region since
he took the post of House International Relations Committee chairman
in January.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's three major indicators of the
money supply -- M1A, M1B and M2 -- all rebounded in July, the Central
Bank of China (CBC) announced Friday.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the CBC, the narrowly defined
M1A money supply (notes and coins issued by the central bank and bank
deposit money) posted a minus 5.97 percent growth rate in July, up
0.79 percentage points from June, while the July M1B level (M1A plus
pass-book saving deposits) posted a minus 2.92 percent growth rate,
up 1.49 percentage points from a month ago.</P>
      <P>In July, the annual growth rate of the more broadly defined M2
money supply (notes, coins held by the public, all private-sector
current accounts at commercial banks, post offices and trustee
savings banks, as well as private-sector deposit accounts with
deposit banks, finance firms, discount houses and dealers in the
money market) rose to 6.34 percent, up 0.33 percentage points from
June and the third consecutive monthly increase, CBC tallies show.</P>
      <P>CBC officials attributed the increase in July's M2 level to a
rise in bank loans, investment and net value of overseas assets. The
increased rate of the M2 levels averaged 5.87 percent during the
January-July period, still within the growth range of between 5
percent and 10 percent targeted by the CBC.</P>

Hung-mao will depart Taipei Aug. 27 for Grenada, where he will attend
a meeting with his counterparts of four ROC diplomatic allies in the

      <P>Tien said Friday that as there has been some criticism from U.S.
Democrats of U.S. policy toward the Asia-Pacific region and as many
influential analysts are highly critical of the Bush administration's
foreign policy, his stays in New York and Boston will allow him to
exchange opinions with some of these people so that they might

    <TEXT>
      <P>With the curtain finally rising on the
much-anticipated Economic Development Advisory Conference (EDAC),
many labor rights and environmental protection groups converged
outside the meeting site Friday to promote their causes.</P>
      <P>The demonstrators included foreign laborers, local labor rights
activists and environmentalists. They had different appeals and the
presence of a large crowd of unexpected petitioners added to the
workload of police officers mobilized to maintain law and order in
the area.</P>
      <P>Among the petitioners were about 100 foreign workers organized by
a local Catholic alliance aimed at protecting the legal rights of
alien laborers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The foreign demonstrators asked the Republic of China government
to heed their contributions to Taiwan's economic development and not
to cut wages and benefits for alien workers in the midst of the
island's current economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>The foreign petitioners said they oppose any proposal to lower
their wages on the grounds that Taiwan's minimum wages for foreign
workers are higher than those offered in Singapore and Hong Kong.
They claimed that Singapore and Hong Kong offer better social welfare
and lower brokerage fees for foreign workers. Moreover, they added,
Singapore and Hong Kong do not impose time limits for foreign workers
and put up less red tape for those wishing to change employers.</P>
      <P>Major local labor rights organizations also mobilized their
members to demonstrate outside the Taipei International Convention
Center, site of the three-day EDAC plenary session.</P>
      <P>Local labor rights activists urged the government not to yield to
pressure from major business groups by slashing stock transaction tax
and land value increment tax because such tax cuts would only benefit
the wealthy and would violate taxation fairness and social justice.</P>
      <P>The labor groups also urged the government not to ease the
existing "go slow, be patient" policy on mainland China-bound
investment, warning that if the government lifts curbs on
cross-Taiwan Strait investment without adopting any effective support
measures, Taiwan's unemployment rate will soon shoot up to 10
percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, several environmental groups, including the Taiwan
Environment Protection Alliance, the Green Civil Action Alliance and
the Wildlife Conservation Alliance, demonstrated against several
investment projects that they claim will damage Taiwan's natural
ecology and living environment. They urged the government not to heed
business groups' demands at the expense of Taiwan's natural

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN  DESERVES  RECOGNITION: CANADIAN MP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Aug.  24 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Canadian member of parliament urged his
government Friday to rethink its "one China" policy that recognizes
Beijing.</P>
      <P>John McKay, chairman of the Canada-Taiwan Parliamentary
Association, said Canada officially adheres to a one-China policy
"that says we support the Chinese government's claim that Taiwan is
an inalienable part of the territory of the People's Republic of
China."</P>
      <P>In other words, Canada's relationship to Taiwan is dictated by
Beijing, he wrote in The National Post, a Canadian newspaper. "It is
time to rethink Canada's one-China policy," he suggested.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Taiwan, the island nation of 23 million, is
Canada's fourth-largest trading partner in Asia and 13th-largest
overall. Major Canadian companies have significant business interests
there and Taiwanese visitors contribute C$300 million (US$200
million) annually to Canada's tourist industry.</P>
      <P>And yet, he went on, this is a country Canada does not recognize
because it does not want to offend Beijing.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan's isolation could be contributed, in part, to the
"monumentally stupid decision" by Chiang Kai-shek to leave the United
Nations in 1971, much has changed in Taiwan since Chiang died in
1975, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan no longer claims to be the government of mainland China
and it has thrown off Chiang's dictatorship and fully embraced
democracy, he noted.</P>
      <P>He said Beijing's unwillingness to recognize the obvious -- that
Taiwan is a separate country -- is built upon its "dubious version of
reality" which reaches back to the 18th century to find what can only
be described as a remote claim to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Canada has nevertheless followed the Beijing line and in turn has
complicated relations with Taiwan. "What China might think" has
driven Canada's policy with Taiwan for too long, McKay stressed.</P>
      <P>Based upon recent evidence in other spheres, mainland China could
care less what others think -- be it the Falun Gong, Tibet or
legitimate democratic rights, he continued. "China is indifferent to
the opinions of others, least of all ours," he said.</P>
      <P>"The Kyoto Protocol serves as a good example of how our one-China
policy impairs our national self-interest," he wrote. Taiwan has
expressed its support for the protocol and has shown a willingness to
voluntarily comply with specific emissions standards.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, however, cannot sign the Kyoto Protocol because of its
lack of legal status and therefore it is reduced to non-binding
arrangements and memoranda of understanding. Canadian governments and
companies will be legally bound by the protocol, but Taiwan and
Taiwanese companies will not. The costs of compliance will go
directly to the Canadian bottom line, but the Taiwanese will not be
under such similar stricture, creating a potential commercial
disadvantage to Canada, he reasoned.</P>
      <P>During a recent visit to Taiwan, McKay and other Canadian MP's
met with President Chen Shui-bian. Chen raised the issue of Taiwan
joining the World Health Organization, McKay said. Taiwan wishes to
be a good global citizen and Chen wanted Canada's support. "What
could be more obvious than having this dynamic island nation join a
worldwide organization dedicated to improving world health?" he
asked.</P>
      <P>Mainland China, however, pressures nations like Canada to resist
the application, he pointed out. The one China policy means that
Taiwan has no legal status and therefore cannot participate in world
health initiatives. "How sensible is it to jeopardize health because
of PRC pressure? Is that in our national or international
self-interest?" he asked.</P>
      <P>He said that every time a Taiwanese official expresses a desire
to come to Canada for meetings at the ministerial level, the Canadian
government goes through its elaborate calibration of the "offense
quotient" to Beijing. The merits of a meeting with a Taiwanese
minister or even the president of one of our largest trading partners
is of secondary concern.</P>
      <P>"In Canada we like to reward our friends, encourage robust
democracy, rules-based trade and respect for human rights. Similarly,
we are critical of countries that abuse human rights, ignore the rule
of law and remain a one-party state. In the case of Taiwan, we are
punishing those who espouse the values we hold dear," he said.</P>

      <P>People First Party (PFP) Chairman James
Soong said his party will withdraw from the year-end election of
county chiefs in two crucial counties and refocus its energy on the
legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Claiming that "the PFP will not engage in any battle it has no
chance of winning," Soong announced the withdrawal of party candidate
Chin Chin-sheng from the election for the Taipei County
magistrateship and candidate Chung Shao-ho from the race for
Kaohsiung County magistrateship.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, the party will back to the hilt its
candidates for the county halls in Nantou, Hualien, Lienchiang,
Kinmen, Taitung and Changhua.</P>
      <P>Soong asked for his supporters' forgiveness because of the
party's abrupt change in policy.</P>
      <P>He made the announcement one day after the collapse of
cooperation talks between his party and the Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Since the PFP has re-calibrated its election campaign to try and
expand its presence in the legislature, Soong said his party will ask
Chung, who is a legislator, to run for re-election, while Chin will
help with the party's day-to-day work.</P>
      <P>Chung, who was informed of Soong's decision just five minutes
before Soong broke the news at a press conference, said in Kaohsiung
County that he felt "shock and regret" and complained that the party
authorities bowed to the KMT too readily.</P>
      <P>He said he will ask the party authorities to reconsider the
decision and take into account the political fallout from the
withdrawal decision, which concerns not only himself but also the
party and the party's credibility among its supporters.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a KMT chief for the party's Kaohsiung County
branch expressed thanks for Soong's decision, saying that it will help
the KMT and its allies to win the Democratic Progressive Party's
power base in the year-end election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIT CHIEF OPTIMISTIC ABOUT WTO MEMBERSHIP FOR TAIPEI, BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  23  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of the American Institute in
Taiwan said Thursday that he is happy to see the removal of the last
barrier to mainland China's entry to the World Trade Organization
(WTO) and that it will also benefit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Richard Bush made the remarks when asked to comment on a
statement by Long Yongtu -- chief mainland Chinese WTO negotiator --
several days ago that both Taiwan and mainland China will be admitted
into the organization at a ministerial meeting of the WTO to be held
in Qatar in November.</P>
      <P>"We understand that there is one issue with respect to the PRC's
accession. We are pleased that it can be resolved in a satisfactory
way, so that the PRC and Taiwan's accession can proceed in the next
couple of months," said Bush, whose agency is charged with handling
exchanges with Taiwan in the absence of official relations between
the United States and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I think it's good for Taiwan, good for the PRC and good for the
international trading system," he added.</P>
      <P>However, U.S. trade officials who asked to remain anonymous said
that Lung's remarks seemed to lack accuracy, as the adoption of entry
documents by the upcoming WTO ministerial meeting will not
necessarily ensure immediate WTO admission of Taiwan and mainland
China.</P>
      <P>They said that the two economies' entry protocols will have to be
approved by their respective congresses first and then their
government will have to officially notify the WTO that they will
accept WTO norms, before they are formally admitted.</P>
      <P>The officials pointed out that it will take time for all these
processes, and estimated that the admission of Taiwan and mainland
China will only be possible in next January at the earliest.</P>
      <P>Membership for Taiwan, which has completed all its bilateral
talks with WTO members on entry terms, has been tied to that of
mainland China because of a tacit understanding among WTO members
that it should be admitted just one step behind mainland China.</P>

1998 Military Maritime Consultative Agreement (MMCA) in Guam Sept.
13-14.</P>
      <P>It will be the first MMCA meeting since the incident, in which
a U.S. Navy EP-3 surveillance plane collided with a mainland Chinese
F-8 fighter jet, killing the fighter pilot and causing a major
standoff between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The objective of the meeting is to discuss principles of safe
flight and navigation for military activities conducted on the high
seas, in international airspace and in exclusive economic zones, said
Davis.</P>
      <P>"We view this meeting as an important step in working past the
EP-3 incident," he said. "It will provide a proper forum for both
sides to discuss the issue of avoiding future incidents."</P>
      <P>The U.S. delegation will be led by Rear Adm. Stephen Smith,
director for strategic planning and policy at the U.S Pacific Command
in Honolulu.</P>
      <P>The MMCA was signed in January 1998 during a trip to Beijing by
then-U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen and his Chinese
counterpart, Chi Hao-tien. It created a consultation mechanism to
strengthen military maritime safety.</P>
      <P>The agreement calls for plenary meetings led by two-star flag
officers, preceded by working group meetings. Special meetings can
also be held as needed.</P>
      <P>There have been two plenary meetings since 1998. The
meeting next month will be the first special session to be convened.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKER CALLS FOR SWEEPING TAX REFORMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition New Party Legislator Lai
Shyh-pao said Saturday that the government should form a tax reform
committee after the ongoing Economic Development Advisory Conference
(EDAC) to review the country's overall taxation system.</P>
      <P>Lai, also an EDAC member, said that many tax reduction proposals
have been put up for discussion at the current EDAC plenary session
in the midst of the domestic economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>"Even I myself support the proposal to cancel commodity taxes on
certain products. But if we only cut taxes without adding new
taxation sources, the government's financial difficulties will worsen
further," Lai said.</P>
      <P>Noting that all the tax adjustment proposals presented to the
EDAC tend to reduce the tax burden on the wealthy while increasing
taxes for poor people, Lai said tax adjustments must adopt a
"two-way" approach -- slashing certain taxes while levying new taxes
or raising tax rates.</P>
      <P>Lai said that Taiwan's overall taxation system contains many
problems and flaws. "Our taxation system needs a comprehensive review
and sweeping reforms," Lai said, adding that the government should
set up a special committee to craft tax reform measures that will
update the nation's taxation system.</P>
      <P>EDAC members from business and industry circles have suggested
that the current stock transaction tax be suspended for a year and
that the land value increment tax be halved for two years. Critics
say the proposals favor the rich at the expense of the poor.</P>
      <P>Both proposals were discussed at the EDAC plenary session held
Saturday. Because of strong opposition from government officials and
representatives of the academic community, the EDAC had yet to decide
as of press time whether the two proposals would be listed as "common
opinions" of all EDAC members. President Chen Shui-bian has said on
many occasions that his administration will fully implement all EDAC
"common opinions."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee Tung-hao, a National Chengchi University professor
and also an EDAC member, suggested that the government implement a
one-third income tax cut for 2001 and 2002 to induce a domestic
recovery by boosting private consumption.</P>
      <P>Lee said private consumption tends to account for 60 percent of
Taiwan's gross domestic product. "Stimulating private consumption
would help revive consumer confidence and thus contribute to the
domestic economic recovery," Lee explained.</P>
      <P>As the proposed income tax cut could result in a NT$160 billion
decrease in government tax revenues, Lee continued, the government
should be authorized to float state bonds to help make ends meet.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he went on, the long-established income tax exemption
privilege for military servicemen and elementary and junior high
school teachers should be canceled from 2003.</P>

      <P>About 30 Falun Gong practitioners held
a demonstration and press conference Friday in front of the mainland
Chinese consulate in Los Angeles to call for urgent support for Falun
Gong practitioners held in the Masanjia Labor Camp in mainland China.</P>
      <P>The press conference marked the start of a seven-day hunger

268-hour vigil representing the 268 practitioners said to have died
as a result of persecution.</P>
      <P>The hunger strike is in support of around 130 practitioners who
have been on hunger strike for over three weeks in the Masanjia camp
in protest over their continued detention despite their sentences

    <HEADLINE>FEATURE (1/5): KINMEN -- BEATING SWORDS INTO PLOWSHARES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Aug. 25 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.
But when your arch-enemy tries to obliterate your beaches, houses and
military installations with 479,554 artillery shells of various
calibers, what can you do? The residents of Kinmen, a small but
strategic frontline outpost of the Republic of China, called upon the
entrepreneurial spirit they share with their Taiwan cousins -- and
made kitchen knives out of the steel shell casings.</P>
      <P>Beating the proverbial swords into plowshares can be quite a
profitable business.</P>
      <P>Tourists from Taiwan -- and the local government is hoping soon
from mainland China and other places as well -- have almost without
exception heard about the famous Kinmen-made cutlery.</P>
      <P>In fact, it is one of the most well-known things about Kinmen, in
addition to its extensive military history, its labyrinth of
interconnected underground air raid shelters, its well-preserved
traditional architecture and its fiery sorghum spirit called
"kaoliang."</P>
      <P>Nowadays, Kinmen is also known among international birdwatchers
as a haven for migratory birds -- well over 200 species of them.</P>
      <P>It is also the focus of what some would call an experiment and a
litmus test in Taipei-Beijing relations since the Jan. 1
establishment of the "mini three links" -- the first-ever direct
transport, trade and postal links between ROC-controlled areas and
mainland China in over five decades.</P>
      <P>According to Kinmen County Commissioner Chen Shui-tsai, the mini
links were meant to serve as a gesture of goodwill to Beijing and to
become a model for the possible opening of the "big three links"
between Taiwan-proper and mainland China in the future.</P>
      <P>However, judging from the lack of success of the mini links so
far, Chen says that he is not optimistic about the establishment of
the "big three links" anytime soon.</P>
      <P>He puts the blame squarely on Beijing, which has been adamant
that Taiwan must embrace the "one China" principle before anything
else can be opened to discussion.</P>
      <P>The mini links, then, have become a unilateral gesture. Over
5,000 people have already traveled the short distance directly from
Kinmen to mainland China's coastal city of Xiamen since January, but
fewer than 300 people from Xiamen have made the journey to Kinmen --
all of them either former Kinmen residents who were unable to return
after the communists took over the mainland after World War II, or
members of a performance troupe invited to put on their show in
Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Seven shipments of sand, gravel and granite have made their way
from Xiamen to Kinmen since Jan. 1, but no Kinmen products have been
shipped to the mainland during the same period.</P>
      <P>The ROC government had also been hoping that with the opening of
the mini three links, mainland tourists would make the short hop
across the narrow distance between Kinmen and Xiamen, thereby
stimulating the local tourism industry.</P>
      <P>However, mainland officials have not allowed such sightseeing
groups to travel to Kinmen and there is no way to know for sure just
how many mainland Chinese would be interested in touring the island
should the ban be lifted.</P>
      <P>Regardless, the county commissioner is planning ahead. He wants
to build a bridge linking Kinmen with Xiamen, which is only a stone's
throw away.</P>
      <P>With NT$34 billion (US$982 million) lying dormant in Kinmen banks
and waiting to be invested in the fast-growing coastal region of
Fujian Province, he said that he is waiting for the political issue
of "one China" to be resolved so that what he terms a "mutually
beneficial economic relationship" between Kinmen and Xiamen can start
to bloom.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kinmen is vigorously upgrading its infrastructure --
with a new commercial port nearing completion, a bridge linking
Kinmen-proper with the isle of "Little Kinmen" to begin construction
in December and plans for a larger airport undergoing feasibility
studies.</P>
      <P>With the number of soldiers on the island likely to be reduced
further because the military and the local population apparently
believe that Kinmen will not be the target of a future Chinese
communist attack, Kinmen has transformed itself into a tourism-based
economy from an economy that used to center around the vast number of
military personnel stationed on the island.</P>
      <P>With its idyllic natural setting, its historic military
attractions and its picturesque folk villages, Kinmen -- which
literally means "golden gate" -- stands poised to become truly a
gateway through which tourists will be able to find a wealth of local
culture and history.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FEATURE (2/5): KINMEN -- THE IMPREGNABLE GATEWAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Aug.  25  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the deadly summer heat, would-be
frogmen training to become the elite of the army's local garrison
forces relentlessly continue their drills on the sandy beaches of
Kinmen, apparently unperturbed by the fact that the Chinese mainland
is only kilometers away.</P>
      <P>The "tadpoles," as they are called before they complete their
three-month basic training, belong to the Republic of China's only
amphibious reconnaissance battalion.</P>
      <P>They are the army's equivalent of the marines -- trained in the
martial arts, capable of fighting and disarming enemies barehanded,
taught to swim over 5,000 meters in the sea before basic training is
completed and skilled in diving, intelligence gathering, demolition
and other military specialties.</P>
      <P>According to a first master sergeant who has been serving with
the amphibious battalion for nearly 17 years, although many soldiers
volunteer to serve in the prestigious unit, only about 70 percent of
the tadpoles make it past the rigorous basic training.</P>
      <P>On another part of the island, meanwhile, an artillery company is
undergoing basic gunnery drill on an eight-inch howitzer.</P>
      <P>Situated in a tunnel carved out of the granite hills and shielded
from prying eyes with camouflage netting, the howitzer -- with
"U.S.A. 1944" stamped on the breechblock -- is manned by eight
soldiers who practice daily, aiming at several predetermined targets
on the Chinese mainland.</P>
      <P>Further along the coast at Mashan Observatory, the northernmost
tip of Kinmen, two soldiers stand sentry at a post known throughout
the ROC military as "the world's No. 1 guard post."</P>
      <P>It is the closest point to mainland China manned by the ROC Armed
Forces. At high tide, the distance from Mashan to Chiaoyu -- the
nearest mainland island -- is only 2,200 meters. At low tide, the
distance shrinks to 1,800 meters.</P>
      <P>While the "speaker wall" at Mashan blasts music and propaganda
across the narrow strait toward the mainland, a mainland Chinese
fishing boat glides past the guard post only a few hundred meters
away.</P>
      <P>The deputy commander of the company stationed in Mashan admits
that even mainland sightseeing boats often draw close to the post so
that the tourists can wave at the sentries and take pictures.</P>
      <P>Maj. Gen. Chen Chin-chih, director of Kinmen Defense Command's
political warfare department, says that although mainland China is
creating "a false sense of peace," the ROC military remains highly
alert and ready to face any possible contingencies.</P>
      <P>The soldiers are taught the concept of "peacetime self-defense,
wartime offensive strike" and understand they are fighting for the
security of the nation and the welfare of the people, he adds.</P>
      <P>IMPREGNABLE GATEWAY TO THE SEA</P>
      <P>Kinmen and its surrounding islands are naturally and artificially
fortified, facilitating its defense while impeding any attacks from
the sea or air.</P>
      <P>As early as the 14th century, during the Ming Dynasty, the
residents of Kinmen built walls and moats around their settlements as
a measure of protection against marauding pirates who roamed the
mainland Chinese coastal regions.</P>
      <P>These fortifications earned the island its present-day name.
Literally, Kinmen means "golden gate," an abbreviation for a phrase
that roughly means the "impregnable gateway to the sea."</P>
      <P>As a frontline ROC garrison for the past five decades, it has
successfully repelled a surprise attack by mainland troops in 1949
and was the target of a massive-scale bombardment in 1958 that became
known all over the world as the Aug. 23 Artillery War.</P>
      <P>Kinmen was struck by an estimated 479,554 shells, establishing a
world record of sorts as each square meter of the island took the
brunt of an average of three hits.</P>
      <P>For the two decades following the 1958 bombardment, until
Washington switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing,
Kinmen was the continual target of bombardment by mainland China on
alternate days.</P>
      <P>Non-explosive shells containing communist propaganda rained down
on the island, but Kinmen stuck true to its name and remained an
impregnable gateway.</P>
      <P>FROM MILITARY TO CIVILIAN RULE</P>
      <P>Because of the delicate frontline nature of Kinmen, the island
remained under military rule until 1992, when control reverted back
to the local civilian government.</P>
      <P>However, a strong military presence can be felt in almost every
aspect of life on the island, pervading the local economy and local
society.</P>
      <P>At the Kinmen Shangyi Airport, groups of soldiers on leave --
still dressed in their camouflage fatigues -- can be seen waiting in
the departure lobby for their flights back to Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE YUAN TO REVISE INTERNAL REGULATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Office of Legislative Counsel of the
Legislative Yuan has drafted a bill to revise the internal
regulations of the legislative organ to improve legislative
efficiency.</P>
      <P>During the fifth session of the fourth legislature between last
February and June, only 42 bills were approved by the Legislative
Yuan and an extraordinary session had to be called in late June to
deliberate six financial bills. Insufficient internal regulations and
a lack of communication between the administration and the
legislature are believed to be the major problems.</P>
      <P>Some legislators have been blamed for taking advantage of the
loose internal regulations and the Office of Legislative Counsel is
trying to revise the regulations to avoid such maneuvers by
individual legislators.</P>
      <P>Under the existing internal regulations, five legislators can
form a caucus which is entitled to attend negotiations between the
administration and the legislature. Many bills failed to be
deliberated during the spring session because boycotts by individual
legislators.</P>
      <P>A majority of legislators support a revision of the internal
regulations, according to Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung of the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP). He added that the DPP, Kuomingtang (KMT) and
People First Party (PFP) have agreed that the hurdle for forming
parliamentarian caucus should be raised to around 13 legislators,
representing 5 percent of the 225 parliamentary seats.</P>
      <P>He said that the three parties are also in agreement that the
hurdle provision should be adopted before a November recess of the
autumn session. The autumn session -- from September till December --
will have a recess in November due to the year-end legislative and
county chief elections.</P>
      <P>The hurdle provision will definitely face resistance from
legislators of small parties and political groups. However, the three
leading political parties are determined to push it through so as to
streamline the operations of the legislature, said Shen.</P>

      <P>About 1,000 protesters to be led by local
overseas Chinese community members and supporters of the Republic of
China's ruling and opposition parties are expected to gather in front
of U.N. Headquarters Sept. 11 to show their support for Taiwan's
latest bid to rejoin the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The demonstration is scheduled to coincide with the opening of
the 56th plenary session of the U.N. General Assembly.</P>
      <P>According to the organizers of the protest, this year will mark
the first time that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the
opposition Kuomintang, People First Party and New Party will join
hands to lend support to Taiwan's cause.</P>
      <P>The organizers said that a formal announcement on the series of
demonstration activities will be made public Wednesday and that they
have already decided that the ROC flag will be prominently displayed
while political party flags will have a lower profile.</P>
      <P>Last year, at the opening of the 55th plenary session of the U.N.

      <P>The Republic of China is seeking to rejoin the United Nations for
the ninth time. Ten of its diplomatic allies have jointly submitted a
proposal asking the world body to reconsider Taiwan's representation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Shrinking trading volume and falling stock
prices have driven down revenues as well as profits of local
securities houses and most of them are planning to adjust downwards
their financial forecast for this year.</P>
      <P>Sources of the Taiwan Stock Exchange Corp. said Saturday that
except for China Trust Securities -- whose NT$1.45 billion pre-tax
profit in the first seven months has already exceeded the NT$1.27
billion target set for the whole year -- most securities houses are
under pressure to downgrade their financial forecasts.</P>
      <P>In order to save on personnel as well as operational costs, many
local securities houses have laid off large numbers of employees
since late last year.</P>
      <P>Yuan Ta Core Pacific, a market leader topping the profit-making
list, has reduced its branch offices around the island from 90 to 72
and cut its personnel from 3,100 to 2,800.</P>
      <P>Fubon Securities, having laid off 100 workers recently, is
planning to lay off another 300 and cut the payroll total to 2,000.</P>
      <P>Polaris Securities prided itself as a pioneer when it invested
heavily in e-commerce last year. In less than a year, the securities
house -- frustrated by the Internet bubble and the depressed stock

      <P>The opposition People

insisted on running for the magistrateship of Kaohsiung County
against the wishes of the party.</P>
      <P>PFP Vice Chairman Chang Chao-hsiung met with Legislator Chung

abandon the Kaohsiung magistrate election, but Chang's efforts were

      <P>Chung said that he made the decision to run for Kaohsiung
magistrate because, he said, he has the support of mainstream
opinion.</P>
      <P>The PFP had originally nominated its Deputy Secretary-General
Chin Chin-sheng to run for Taipei County magistrate and Chung to run
for Kaohsiung magistrate.</P>
      <P>However, PFP Chairman James Soong announced Friday at a press
conference that the party would not contest the two posts on the
grounds that Chairman Lien Chan of the main opposition Kuomintang

    <HEADLINE>EDAC FAILS TO REACH CONSENSUS ON TAX CUT PROPOSALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ongoing Economic Development Advisory
Conference (EDAC) failed to reach consensus Saturday on two tax cut
proposals but agreed to list them as "majority opinions" and refer
them to the government for reference in future policy formulation.</P>
      <P>Commerce and industry representatives to the conference came up
with the proposals during preparatory panel sessions that the
government suspend the stock transaction tax for one year and halve
the land value increment tax for two years in the midst of the
lingering domestic economic doldrums.</P>
      <P>Because of opposition from other EDAC members, however --
particularly those from relevant government agencies and the academic
community -- the two proposals failed to receive unanimous support at
Saturday's EDAC plenary session.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian, who concurrently serves as EDAC
chairman, has promised that his administration will fully implement
proposals unanimously agreed upon by the 120 conference attendees. In
comparison, the government will have discretion to decide whether or
not to implement proposals that do not receive unanimous support.</P>
      <P>Several other proposals, including raising the ceiling on public
debts, were also listed as "majority opinions," although the
government had originally hoped that the proposal to raise the cap on
public debts could receive unanimous support to allow it to float
more state bonds to ease its financial straits.</P>
      <P>At Saturday's EDAC plenary session, the participants managed to
forge 17 "common opinions" or "unanimous opinions" and 19 "majority
opinions" on government restructuring, tax reforms, and other
relevant financial and banking issues.</P>
      <P>One of the unanimous opinions concerns the much-anticipated
government restructuring with a view to upgrading administrative
efficiency and slashing government expenditure. The proposal requires
the government to present a draft revision bill on the current
Executive Yuan organization law to the first session of the new
Legislative Yuan that will be elected Dec. 1.</P>
      <P>Another unanimous opinion is that the government should come up
with a comprehensive tax reform plan and present relevant legal
revision bills to the new legislature for screening during its first
session.</P>
      <P>Other major unanimous opinions include that the government should
promote the privatization of state-owned enterprises in line with
general global trends and viable market terms and that the government
should work out a plan to balance its budget in five to 10 years.</P>
      <P>The unanimous opinions also require the government to take
concrete steps to expand the scale of Taiwan's securities market,
respect stock market mechanisms and push for greater transparency and
higher efficiency in the management of four major government-run
funds in stock investment.</P>
      <P>The government should also forge a mechanism to facilitate the
restructuring and merger of local financial institutions and should
offer more incentives to encourage mergers of local banks.</P>
      <P>The EDAC opened Friday and is scheduled to close Sunday.
Discussions Saturday focused on financial reforms and employment
issues.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP CHAIR REGRETS KMT RELUCTANCE TO COOPERATE ON ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco, Aug. 24 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong expressed regret here Friday over the opposition
Kuomintang's (KMT's) reluctance to cooperate with his party in
Taiwan's year-end elections for local government chiefs.</P>
      <P>Soong said after his arrival in San Francisco for a brief visit
that the KMT's grassroots members have been reluctant to support the
PFP's cooperation proposals, even though KMT Chairman Lien Chan has
shown a sincere desire to field joint tickets for local government
chief elections in certain cities and counties.</P>
      <P>Soong said he has maintained a cordial friendship and smooth
contacts with Lien. "We often exchange views on major policy issues,"
he said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Soong said he was saddened by KMT grassroots party
workers' reluctance to throw their support behind any of the
PFP-proposed candidates for mayoral and magistrate elections
scheduled for Dec. 1.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Soong said, the PFP has finally decided
not to enter candidates for the Taipei and Kaohsiung county
magistrate elections. "It's a difficult decision to make," he said,
adding: "In view of our party's limited resources, we can't engage in
any battle that we have no chance of winning."</P>
      <P>Soong said the PFP will refocus its energy on the legislative
elections in the two counties and other areas around Taiwan. As for
the local government chief elections, Soong said the PFP will
concentrate its campaign efforts in Taitung, Miaoli and Nantou
counties, where he said the party stands good chances of winning.</P>
      <P>He also said he had urged President Chen Shui-bian during a
recent meeting to push the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
to adjust its pro-independence ideology in order to seek a
breakthrough to the deadlocked relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Soong said the KMT made a wrong assessment of mainland China's
economic development potential in the latter years of its rule of
Taiwan. "The KMT's underestimation of mainland China's development
potential has had a serious adverse impact on Taiwan's current
political and economic development," he claimed.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Soong went on, he reminded Chen, a DPP
stalwart, that the DPP must revise its pro-independence party charter
to facilitate the development of cross-strait relations. Otherwise,
he went on, Taiwan's economic prospects will remain gloomy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKER QUESTIONS COURT RULING ON LEAKING OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Diane Lee said Saturday that a
military court ruling which claims that an army officer was guilty of
leaking classified information to the press was questionable and "a
blow to the freedom of speech."</P>
      <P>Lee said in a press conference that Maj. Liu Chih-chung's case
should have been handled more fairly, justly and openly.</P>
      <P>Liu -- who provided a local reporter with information that
mainland Chinese warships were seen in waters close to Taiwan before
the presidential inauguration last May -- was sentenced to nine years
in prison for leaking military secrets, corruption and theft.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the information Liu disclosed did not fit the
military's definition of classified information and that the judge's
ruling that Liu's disclosure illegally benefited the reporter was
questionable because the information did not help the reporter
receive any monetary rewards from his newspaper for his exclusive
report.</P>
      <P>On the ruling of theft, Lee said that the court believed Liu
stole dissertation reports from a military seminar on joint service
warfare, whereas she believed that in fact, such information
presented at academic seminars is in the public domain.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INVESTIGATION INTO MAGAZINE ATTACK GETS UNDERWAY: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China law enforcement
authorities have launched investigation into the recent attack on
the office of a local magazine, a Presidential Office spokeswoman
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Kuo Yao-chi, director of the Public Affairs Office under the
Presidential Office, made the remarks after a U.S.-based
organization sent a letter to ROC President Chen Shui-bian
expressing its concern about the recent attack on the office of
"Taiwan Next" weekly.</P>
      <P>The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said
in its letter to President Chen that the ROC government should
ensure that police investigation into the attack is thorough and
professional.</P>
      <P>Around midday of Aug. 22, a group of men wielding baseball bats
charged into the downtown Taipei office of Taiwan Next, a
tabloid-style magazine, and smashed windows, computers, and office
furniture. No one was injured in the attack.</P>
      <P>"As an organization of journalists dedicated to the defense of
press freedom around the world, CPJ is alarmed by this criminal
attack on Taiwan Next," the organization said in its letter, adding
that ROC authorities must ensure that those involved in the attack
are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, thereby sending a
clear message that attacks against the press will not be tolerated.</P>
      <P>In response to the CPJ's concern, Kuo said ROC law enforcement
authorities have been dealing with the case. "As the case has
already entered judicial procedures, the Presidential Office will
respect judicial ruling on the criminal attack case," she added.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan Next," owned by Hong Kong tycoon Jimmy Lai, is known for
its paparazzi-style coverage of public figures, and it has been
defendants in at least three lawsuits since its May 30 launch in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A "Next" editor said magazine staffers had received many
threatening phone calls in the past as a result of its coverage
of scandals involving politicians, criminals and celebrities.
"We have no idea who did this," he said.</P>

      <P>Japanese Lower House member Koki Kobayashi
has said that he would do his best to help former Republic of China
President Lee Teng-hui to revisit Japan for medical treatment this
fall.</P>
      <P>Kobayashi was in Taipei at the head of a 28-member Japanese
parliamentarian mission to attend the inauguration of the
Taiwan-Japanese Parliamentarians Goodwill Alliance Friday.</P>
      <P>The Japanese government allowed Lee to visit Japan for a
heart operation last April amid protest from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lee hinted to reporters a few days ago that he hopes to make a
post-operation examination in Japan this fall, and his remarks
triggered mixed reactions in Japan.</P>
      <P>Some friendly Japanese politicians have voiced their support for
Lee's Japan visit, while some others, including pro-Beijing Foreign
Minister Makiko Tanaka, are against Lee's visit, fearing that it
might affect Japan's friendly relations with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Kobayashi told reporters that despite the mixed reactions in
Japan, he would do his best to help realize Lee's plan to
revisit Japan this fall to further improve friendly relations between
the two countries.</P>
      <P>Beijing has regarded Lee as a promoter of Taiwan independence

      <P>Nevertheless, the U.S. government ignored protest from Beijing

    <HEADLINE>FEATURE (3/5): KINMEN -- A VERDANT SANCTUARY FOR MIGRATORY BIRDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Aug.  26  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The pristine environment of Kinmen -- a
Republic of China island located off the southeastern coast of
mainland China and just north of the Tropic of Cancer -- provides an
ideal sanctuary for a diverse population of migratory birds and is a
testament to the government's success in bringing lushness back to
the once-barren island.</P>
      <P>Although Kinmen covers only 150 square kilometers, birdwatchers
have already spotted 287 species of birds on the island,
approximately 75 percent of which are migratory.</P>
      <P>The large number of birds that grace the crystal-clear ponds
throughout the different seasons makes it all the more difficult to
imagine that Kinmen used to be an arid, hilly island covered with
granite, sandy soil and red loam where only drought-resistant crops
like sorghum, corn, peanuts and sweet potatoes could survive.</P>
      <P>According to historical records, Kinmen was once covered in lush
forest. Since the 13th century, however, woodcutting to boil seawater
for salt, tree felling for shipbuilding and other over-logging
practices gradually denuded the island.</P>
      <P>This exposed the sandy soil to the wind, leading to dust storms
and erosion.</P>
      <P>Local villagers turned to "wind lion" gods for help, but the
government stepped in with some concrete measures to rein in the
desertification.</P>
      <P>Since 1950, the government has embarked on an ambitious
reforestation program to make Kinmen into the lush tropical island it
once was.</P>
      <P>Local legend has it that Gen. Hu Lien, who served as the
commanding general of the local garrison forces from 1949 to 1957,
ordered each soldier to be responsible for the well-being of 10
trees.</P>
      <P>If any of the saplings withered as a result of mistreatment or
neglect, so the popular story goes, the soldier assigned to care for
it would be held accountable and disciplined.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, another regulation banned residents from raising goats
to prevent the animals from chewing up seedlings, illustrating the
government and the military's determination to bring the lush, green
environment back to Kinmen.</P>
      <P>To counter recurrent droughts, late ROC President Chiang Kai-shek
instructed during a 1965 autumn visit to Kinmen to dig wells, build
dams, develop water sources and provide for tap water to tackle the
hardships faced by the people and the soldiers who lacked fresh
water.</P>
      <P>A bay was enclosed and dams were constructed to create artificial
lakes. Soon birds began to flock to the island.</P>
      <P>Kinmen National Park Superintendent Hsu Wun-long says that Kinmen
is a small island whose delicate ecosystem could be easily upset.</P>
      <P>Therefore, a national park was established in October 1995 to
help preserve what reforestation has brought back to Kinmen, and also
to preserve the island's history and culture.</P>
      <P>Hsu says that the diversity of local fauna and flora could be
attributed partly to the success of the military's reforestation
efforts. The trees have helped lock in moisture and provide shade
which has generally lowered ground temperatures, allowing fish and
other animal life to flourish in the cooler environment.</P>
      <P>Otters and horseshoe crabs can also be found in Kinmen,
illustrating the low level of pollution on the island.</P>
      <P>However, the environment must be continually monitored to ensure
that such factors as water quality and pollution levels are kept
within standards, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Some of the recommended bird watching spots in Kinmen include
Lake Tzu, the mouth of the Wu River, the Kinsha Reservoir and Lake
Linshui on Little Kinmen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DISCUSSIONS FOCUS ON `1992 CONSENSUS' AT ECONOMIC CONFERENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  26  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The so-called "1992 consensus" of "one
China, where Taipei and Beijing can make their own interpretations"
became the focus of discussions Sunday, the final day of the ongoing
Economic Development Advisory Conference.</P>
      <P>Almost half of the 120 conference participants signed up to voice
their opinions on cross-Taiwan Strait issues at the session, which
was presided over by Koo Chen-fu, Taipei's top negotiator with
Beijing and chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation.</P>
      <P>Koo said that because Taipei's direct control over certain
cross-strait affairs is limited, any conclusions arrived at the
conference on related issues must still rely on Beijing's
cooperation, otherwise they would be difficult to implement.</P>
      <P>Opposition New Party delegates proposed to include the acceptance
of the 1992 consensus in the final conclusions of the conference to
ease cross-strait tensions.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Vice President Yao Eng-chi, a member of the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT), seconded the proposal to return to the
1992 consensus that was embraced by the previous KMT administration.</P>
      <P>However, the proposal was opposed by a delegate of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party, who warned that Taiwan would be putting
restrictions on itself by accepting the 1992 consensus. He suggested
that if the opposition parties insist on the consensus, another
conference should be held to deal specifically with that issue.</P>
      <P>The proposal did not receive approval from the 120 conference
members to be included in the final conclusions.</P>
      <P>Consensus was reached on 36 cross-strait issues, including a
change in the government's policy toward local business investments
in mainland China from "no haste, be patient" to the less restrictive
"active liberalization, effective management."</P>
      <P>The conference participants also agreed to urge the government to
seek to resolve the partisan differences in regard to the "1992
consensus" while defining cross-strait relations in accordance with
the Republic of China Constitution.</P>

      <P>Chinese Taipei scored first in the third inning, but Mexico came

blamed the loss on what he said was an obvious bias by an umpire in
Mexico's favor.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that the plate umpire was not calling balls and
strikes fairly for the Taiwan team and the only way his pitchers
could get strikes was to throw nothing but fast balls.</P>

said.</P>
      <P>Lee Cheng-ta, the manager of the Chinese Taipei squad, also
complained that the baseball field was bigger than what his players
were used to and long fly balls that would have been home runs in

defeated in the first round of the semifinals. The two will compete
for third place in the tournament. Lee predicted that Chinese Taipei

    <HEADLINE>MOTC UNAWARE OF NEW PARTY LAWMAKER'S PLANNED MAINLAND TRIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  26  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) is unaware of a planned mainland trip by New
Party lawmaker Elmer Feng for talks on postal and transportation
links with the mainalnd, vice minister Ho Cheng-tan said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Ho said he has heard nothing about such a trip and pointed out
that the issue regarding the establishment of the "three links" is
beyond the power of the MOTC.</P>
      <P>Ho said although many enthusiastic people have offered different
proposals to the government on the issue, the government cannot
accept them all. Ho said that even though he was unaware of Feng's
plans, he felt that the lawmaker had the best intentions in mind.</P>
      <P>Feng announced at a gathering with local residents of Taipei
City's Ta-an district earlier the same day that he will lead a
delegation to mainland China in mid-September for discussions on
postal and transportation links across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>According to Feng, he has informed the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) and the MOTC of his planned trip and that he will travel to the
mainland as long as the two governments' authorities approve his
plans.</P>
      <P>The lawmaker said he will visit the mainland in his capacity as
chief of the "Cross-Strait People's Service Center" and voiced his
hope that the MAC and the MOTC would send relevant officials to serve
as private advisers for his delegation.</P>
      <P>Feng predicted that if he could make the trip, the mainland
Chinese side would agree to set up postal and express delivery links
and exchanges of remittances of small amounts of money with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Criticizing the ongoing Economic Development Advisory Conference
as being fraught with "masked acts," he said the government's
decision to shift to the "proactive openness and effective
management" policy from its previous stance of "no haste" is just a
hollow slogan.</P>
      <P>Feng said he knew that the "1992 consensus" would not be approved
by the economic conference and that the easing of the "no haste, be
patient" policy is only aimed at reducing pressure from the private
sector.</P>

      <P>A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign

      <P>On the contrary, the spokeswomen said, the United States was

stops on the basis of "safety, comfort and convenience."</P>
      <P>The minister's spokeswoman made the comments in response to

    <TEXT>
      <P>The World Taiwan Benevolent Association,
which is an extention of the Taiwan Benevolent Association in America
(TBAA), was formally founded Saturday in Seattle with Minister of the
Cabinet-level Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission (OCAC) Chang Fu-mei
and Republic of China Representative to the United States Chen
Chien-jen witnessing.</P>
      <P>More than 100 delegates from TBAA chapters the United States,
Taiwan, and Europe took part in the founding ceremony, which also
marked the 24th annual convention of the TBAA.</P>
      <P>The TBAA, founded in the 1970s under the initiation of the
Kuomintang's Overseas Chinese Affairs Department, has gradually
de-emphasized the political purpose of the group and focused instead
on social interactions and service.</P>
      <P>The gathering was considered significant enough that Chang
attended the TBAA annual convention for the first time since the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) assumed power over a year ago.</P>
      <P>Addressing those assembled at the ceremony, Chang highly praised
members of the TBAA for their patriotism. "You have always put
yourselves forward in the fight against Beijing when Beijing has put
pressure on Taiwan during the past years," Chang said.</P>
      <P>"You generously donated cash and materials to Taiwan when a
killer earthquake jolted the central part of the island on Sept. 21,
1999, claiming more than 2,000 lives and when we suffered heavy
damage and loss of life due to Typhoon Toraji, which swept through
Taiwan recently, " Chang added.</P>
      <P>Chang told the overseas Chinese that they should ignore the
entreaties by Beijing to turn their back on a democratic Taiwan. He
said that it should be clear that Beijing was only scheming to
subvert the causes of the government of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>ROC Representative to the United States Chen Chien-jen spoke
highly of the patriotism and dedication to their homeland during the
past 24 years that the supporters of Taiwan have shown. He also
lauded their contributions to help ROC diplomatic missions abroad
promote relations with the ROC.</P>
      <P>ROC President Chen Shui-bian, U.S. President George W. Bush and

    <HEADLINE>EDAC AGREES ON 36 CROSS-STRAIT TRADE ISSUES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  26  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Participants of the Economic Development
Advisory Conference (EDAC) reached consensus on 36 issues on
Taiwan-mainland trade ties Sunday, while deciding to refer their
different viewpoints about the "1992 consensus" to the government.</P>
      <P>More than 100 prominent representatives from the local business
community, the academic and the government sectors, although holding
differing stances, agreed on 36 issues linked to the improvement in
trade ties between Taiwan and mainland China in a package vote.</P>
      <P>But the participants decided to submit various opinions on the
"1992 consensus" -- which refers to the disputed "one China,
respective interpretations" principle -- to the government to put
aside differences between the political parties on the matter.</P>
      <P>By doing so, they voiced the hope that the government can quickly
forge a national consensus on the critical issue to be able to give a
definition to cross-strait relations in accordance with the Republic
of China Constitution and to start negotiations with the mainalnd on
the establishment of the "three links" and on other issues which may
benefit the people on both sides.</P>
      <P>Key conclusions reached during the meeting include:</P>
      <P>-- "Taiwan first," "global management," "mutual benefits," and
"risk control management" are the pivotal principles regarding trade
and commerce activities across the Taiwan Strait;</P>
      <P>-- Adopt a "proactive openness and effective management" policy
to replace the previous "no haste, be patient" policy regarding
mainland-bound investment;</P>
      <P>-- Set up flexible mechanisms to monitor movements of capital
between the two sides; and introduce mainland Chinese capital to the
local property and real estate market;</P>
      <P>-- Establish direct trade, transportation and postal links across
the Strait and allow limited imports of mainland-made products in
line with the two sides' entry into the World Trade Organization; and</P>
      <P>-- Under the principle of national security, open up the local
tourist market to mainland Chinese visitors.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW COMMITTEE WILL SCREEN MAINLAND-BOUND INVESTMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  27  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi
said Monday that his ministry will form a committee to craft new
rules for mainland China-bound investment.</P>
      <P>Lin said the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) must formulate
new rules of the game now that the government has decided to relax
restrictions on investment in mainland China in line with a
recommendation reached by consensus at the Economic Development
Advisory Conference.</P>
      <P>The just-concluded, 120-member conference passed a proposal that
requires the government to replace the "no haste, be patient"
cross-Taiwan Strait investment policy with "active opening, effective
management."</P>
      <P>Lin said the MOEA will form a new committee, to be composed of
government officials, industry executives and academics, to screen
items to be allowed for mainland China-bound investment under the new
policy.</P>
      <P>In preparation for the formation of the new working group, Lin
said the MOEA will consult with relevant government agencies,
including the Ministry of Finance, the Mainland Affairs Council and
the Council for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
      <P>Lin pointed out that even under the "no haste, be patient"
policy, restrictions on mainland investment have been confined to
only a few lines of business.</P>
      <P>Under the policy, Lin said, Taiwan entrepreneurs can freely
invest in 62 percent of industries. Meanwhile, 90 percent of
cross-strait investment projects in the 34 percent of categories
subject to case-by-case scrutiny have been approved.</P>
      <P>"In all, the 'no haste' policy has affected only about 7 percent
of cross-strait investment applications, mainly those for
infrastructure construction and cutting-edge and capital-intensive
industries," Lin explained.</P>
      <P>After the "no haste, be patient" policy is eased, Lin said, the
soon-to-be-formed committee will decide whether up-stream
petrochemical and wafer industries and several other high-tech
concerns will be opened for cross-strait investment.</P>
      <P>Lin added that he personally hopes that local enterprises will
still refrain from investing in certain high-tech industries and
infrastructure construction projects, such as power plants and
railroads.</P>
      <P>"I look forward to seeing local enterprises adopt a 'Taiwan
first' investment policy," Lin said, adding that the MOEA will
actively assist Taiwan firms in making overseas investments while
keeping their business roots at home.</P>
      <P>Under the "no haste, be patient" policy, mainland investment
projects worth more than US$50 million each are subject to
case-by-case scrutiny. In the future, Lin said, the Taiwan-mainland
China investment ratio will be NT$100 to NT$20 or NT$30. "It means
that local companies must invest at least NT$100 (US$2.90) in Taiwan
before they are allowed to invest NT$20 to NT$30 in mainland China,"
he explained.</P>
      <P>He further reminded local enterprises to fulfill their duties to
protect their employees' legal rights and interests before launching
new ventures on the mainland. "Local companies should also not leave
their debts in Taiwan and then relocating to the mainland," he
stressed.</P>
      <P>The minister further said the "no haste, be patient" policy has
had positive effects on Taiwan's economic development in the past
years, particularly in helping maintain domestic economic stability.</P>
      <P>"The 'no haste' policy should not be blamed for rising domestic
unemployment and other current economic woes," Lin added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSMC READY FOR DEPLOYMENT IN MAINLAND CHINA: MORRIS CHANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  27  (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei, Aug. 27 (CNA): Morris Chang, chairman of the Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (TSMC), said Sunday that the
leading semiconductor foundry is ready to open operations in mainland
China as part of the corporation's global strategy.</P>
      <P>Chang said at the plenary meeting on the last day of the
three-day Economic Development Advisory Conference (EDAC) that he
must acknowledge the importance of the global market, while
advocating the principle of "priority to Taiwan."</P>
      <P>TSMC cannot afford to ignore the investment incentives and
advantages offered by the Beijing authorities, said Chang, although
he has said many times in the past that TSMC was not preparing to
begin operations in mainland China.</P>
      <P>A number of TSMC's local competitors have sought to invest in
mainland China by using whatever means possible before the government
lifts the restrictions on the semiconductor sector, but TSMC insists
on abiding by the regulations.</P>
      <P>An industry source said that Chang is aware that his integrity
may cause the company to lose its competitiveness in the long run,
and the advisor to the economic conference used the meeting to speak
of the problems encountered by his company.</P>
      <P>At the conference panel discussions, Chang urged the government
to take the initiative and be open-minded in its cross-Taiwan Strait
economic and trade policies.</P>
      <P>Although TSMC has no immediate plans to investment in mainland
China, the semiconductor foundry cannot go against the tide,
according to Chang.</P>
      <P>A world leader in the manufacture of integrated circuits, TSMC
has over 14,500 employees in Taiwan, Japan, the United States and
Europe. In 2000, the company's annual sales was US$5.3 billion.</P>
      <P>The semiconductor sector worldwide is suffering from an
unprecedented slump in sales and TSMC's sales in the past few months
has also dropped considerably from last year's level.</P>
      <P>Company spokesman K.C. Chen announced recently that TSMC's net
sales for July totaled NT$8.6 billion, down 42.7 percent from the
level of the same month last year.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the net sales value in July increased by one
percent from that of the previous month. The market has been showing
signs of gradual recovery since early July and the prospects for the
second half of this year are expected to improve, she added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLL SHOWS MORE MANUFACTURERS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT ECONOMIC PROSPECTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei.  Aug. 27 (CNA)
(By Lillian lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A survey conducted by the Taiwan Institute
of Economic Research (TIER) in July showed that more local
manufacturers are optimistic about the economic prospects for the
second half of this year than they were the month before.</P>
      <P>Among the manufacturers polled in July, 30.2 percent said that
they were optimistic about the economic prospects in the second half
of this year, and 26.5 percent were pessimistic. A similar survey in
June showed that only 26.6 percent of those replying to the
questionnaires said that they believed there would be an economic
recovery in the second half, and 27.5 percent were negative about the
prospects.</P>
      <P>While 10.6 percent of those polled considered the economic
climate in July "good" and 53.4 percent thought it "normal," the TIER
report pointed out that the manufacturers were more positive about
the market because traditionally the second half was a brisk season
for orders.</P>
      <P>TIER President Wu Rong-I said that a fully-fledged domestic
economic recovery will rely on the improvement of the international
economic climate and effective implementation of the government's
public investment and reconstruction projects. While prospects for
the key industry -- the semiconductor sector -- remains gloomy, a
quick economic recovery is unlikely.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASIA-PACIFIC ANTI-CHILD PROSTITUTION MEETING OPENS IN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  27  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Anti-child prostitution activists from
major Asia-Pacific countries met in Taipei Monday to discuss
effective measures to fight commercial sexual abuse of children.</P>
      <P>This is the first time that a regional meeting of its kind has
been held in the Republic of China. Representatives from Japan,
India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand and the host ROC
are taking part in the two-day conference.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening ceremony, Kao-Lee Li-chen, president of
the End Child Prostitution Association (Taiwan), said child
prostitution has been drawing increasing concern in the international
community along with globalization.</P>
      <P>For instance, Kao-Lee said, calls for cross-border cooperation
have become louder to crack down on pornographic child photos on the
Internet and sex-oriented tours.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Asia-Pacific area encompasses a wide range of
diverse cultures, Kao-Lee said Asia-Pacific countries have different
ways to cope with child prostitution issues.</P>
      <P>"We hope that the current conference provides a forum for
countries in the region to exchange views and experiences in their
efforts to end child prostitution," said Kao-Lee.</P>
      <P>The conference will focus discussions on measures to curb
commercial sexual abuse of children, pleasure trips targeted at child
prostitutes and Internet child pornography.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Ron O. Grady, honorary chairman of
the international End Child Prostitution Association, said that the
phenomenon of sex-oriented pleasure trips has been growing rapidly in
Asia.</P>
      <P>Grady said many Japanese and American men have joined so-called
"sex tours," with the Philippines and Thailand as main destinations
for their "sexual adventures."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Grady said that since communist regimes collapsed in
eastern Europe, criminal rings in the region have found that
kidnapping children to sell into prostitution is a lucrative trade,
resulting in a sharp increase in the number of child prostitutes in
eastern Europe.</P>
      <P>Noting that stopping both Internet child pornography and
cross-border smuggling of children who may be sold into prostitution
needs international cooperation, Grady said all countries around the
world should join forces to combat these criminal activities.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung is scheduled to
leave Taipei Sept. 1 for official visits to the Republic of China's
four allies in the eastern Caribbean region, a Cabinet spokesman said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Chang will visit Saint Kitts and Nevis Sept. 3, the Commonwealth
of Dominica Sept. 4, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Sept. 5-6, and
Grenada Sept. 7, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>It will be Chang's first overseas trip since he assumed office
last October.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the four East Caribbean nations are staunch
allies of the ROC. "They have consistently supported the ROC's bids
to join the United Nations and other major international
organizations," he added.</P>
      <P>Since Chang took the premiership, the spokesman went on, senior
officials of the four Caribbean nations have visited Taiwan and
invited him to tour their countries.</P>
      <P>"We believe that Chang's upcoming diplomatic tour will further
boost our cordial relationships with the four countries," the
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>As the U.N. General Assembly will open its annual plenary session
Sept. 11, the spokesman said, Chang will take advantage of his tour
to solicit the four allies' continued support for the ROC's U.N. bid.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO MORE IN PROMOTING CLEAN POLITICS: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  27  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Public evaluation of the government's
performance in promoting clean politics has declined slightly
from last year's level, according to the results of an opinion
poll released Monday.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) has commissioned National Chengchi
University to survey public opinions about the government's efforts
to promote clean politics annually in recent years.</P>
      <P>The latest survey found that the government has managed to
receive a "passing grade" this year, but the score fell below last
year's level by a small margin and failed to reach 65 points.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Justice Hsieh Wen-ting said the mild decline
might result from public misperception. "As law enforcement
authorities have endeavored to crack down on official corruption and
vote-buying over the past year, local people might have misperceived
that political graft remains rampant in Taiwan," Hsieh explained,
adding that many suspected corruption cases under investigation were
committed sometimes ago.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the MOJ will not be daunted by the decline in public
rating of its anti-corruption operations. "We'll instead redouble
our efforts to wipe out corruption and establish clean politics,"
he added.</P>
      <P>Poll results showed that survey respondents were particularly
dissatisfied with the current government's indecisiveness toward
certain major public issues.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that the respondents were also very
dissatisfied with the performances of elected representatives,
including legislators and members of city and county councils.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a majority of survey respondents said they have no
confidence in the effects of reporting suspected corruption cases to
relevant law enforcement authorities.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, the respondents said they thought that
government officials in charge of procurement and
construction administration affairs are most likely to take bribes
or get involved in kickback scandals.</P>
      <P>The poll further found that the majority of respondents are
aware that the current Democratic Progressive Party-led government
has pledged to eradicate "black gold" politics, or shady links
between politics and organized crime, and official corruption. Most
of those interviewed also threw support behind the proposal to
set up an independent anti-corruption agency.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,086 adults were questioned in this year's poll.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER  PREMIER  HAILS SUCCESS OF EDAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  27 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Premier Vincent Siew hailed Monday
the Economic Development Advisory Conference (EDAC) initiated by
President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Siew, who served as one of the five deputy conveners of the
just-concluded EDAC, offered high praise for the fruitful results
accomplished by the EDAC.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks during an interview with the Broadcasting
Corporation of China (BCC).</P>
      <P>He pointed out that one of the achievements of the three-day EDAC
was the consensus that the government's "no haste, be patient" policy
that restrict local investment in mainland China should be adjusted.</P>
      <P>This adjustment will be a great step forward, Siew said, adding
that in the rapidly changing world, cross-Taiwan Strait economic
policy should also be readjusted to meet the challenges.</P>
      <P>However, he added that the "no haste, be patient" policy adopted
by the government in 1996 was the correct one in its day. Taiwan's
information technology industry had just began to develop when the
government implemented the policy, Siew went on, adding that no-one
could have predicted the outcome of Taiwan's economic development if
adequate control measures had not been adopted.</P>
      <P>The policy was very useful in helping Taiwan's economic
development at that time, Siew said, adding that in the face of the
new century and the new economic situation at home and abroad, the
adjustment of the policy is essential.</P>
      <P>Asked why Chen mentioned his "new middle way" line at the EDAC,
Siew said that Chen was apparently telling the fundamentalists in the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) that the "new middle way"
is the only possible way forward.</P>
      <P>He called on the DPP and the Chen administration to readjust the
nation's economic policy in a timely manner.</P>
      <P>Siew also denied news reports that Chen had asked his five
deputies to propose at the EDAC plenary session Sunday a revision of
the land value-added tax and the cap on government debts.</P>
      <P>Siew also dismissed news reports that he will be renamed premier
of the ROC. He called on both the government and people to
concentrate their efforts on promoting Taiwan's economic development.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said Monday
that it will not invite the newly formed Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) to a cross-party consulation meeting that the KMT will host in
two weeks.</P>
      <P>Participating in the meeting, which will focus on working out
ways to implement the agreements reached at the just-concluded
Economic Development Advisory Conference, will be leaders of the four
major political parties -- the ruling Democratic Progressive Party,
and the oppositon KMT, the People First Party and the New Party, all
of which hold seats in the Legislative Yuan, said Wang Chih-kang,
director-general of the KMT's Cultural Communication Commiteee.</P>
      <P>Wang said that as the TSU does not have any seats in the
legislature, it will not be invited to the consultation meeting.</P>
      <P>Wang also expressed the party's affirmation to the convening of
the EDAC, an idea of Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian to
boost the sluggish economy.</P>
      <P>The nation's major political parties, economic and industrial
experts, as well as business leaders, had a wide exchange of views on
Taiwan's economic problems through the EDAC and reached many
conclusions in the three-day meeting that ended Sunday.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the KMT is glad that most of its suggestions
presented at the EDAC were accepted and that Chen has also given its
support to the idea of a political consultation meeting initiated by
KMT Chairman Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tsai Chia-fu of the KMT caucus in the Legislative Yuan
said that it would be better if the political consultation meeting is
organized by the KMT as it is the largest party in the legislature.
Tsai was responding to a proposal of Tsai Huang-liang -- the DPP
caucus leader in the legislature -- who said the meeting should be
convened by the president.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that the political consultation meeting should
focus on cross-strait ties, a ceiling on government debt, tax
reductions and other "crucial topics," and that the president should
attend the meeting.</P>
      <P>The KMT will invite secretaries-generals of the major political
parties to meet Friday to prepare for the meeting.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A three-day forum aimed at promoting
information exchanges among Taiwan's biotechnological firms opened in
Taipei Monday.</P>
      <P>The 2001 Taipei International Master Forum on Biotechnology has
been organized by the Industrial Technology Research Institute and
brings together 24 speakers from the United States, Australia, Japan,
Hong Kong, mainland China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chintay Shih, president of the Industrial Technology Research
Institute, said the purpose of the forum is to harness Taiwan's
well-developed information technology to the development of
biotechnology, with the focus on biochips, bioinformation and
biopharmaceuticals.</P>
      <P>David P. Flores, president of the world's leading
biotechnological intelligence providers -- BioCentury Publishing
Company -- gave a speech at the opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>He urged technological firms to ensure their survival and
prosperity through joint ventures, industrial alliances and
technology transfers.</P>
      <P>After the bursting of the optimistic bubble with regard to dotcom
firms, Flores said, the public should give a cautious appraisal to
biotechnological firms.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou was also invited to attend the
opening ceremony. He touted Taipei -- which hosts seven of the
country's 12 medical centers -- as an ideal base for technological
firms because of its huge population of technologists and the soft
loans available from the Taipei Bank for biotechnological firms.</P>
      <P>He promised to relax city zoning restrictions to accommodate the
establishment of pharmaceutical companies in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, GeneMaster, a local biochemical firm, unveiled a
biochip called the Galaxy Chip at the forum.</P>
      <P>The chip, purported to be the first "live" chip in the world, is
the brainchild of GeneMaster and the Tri Service General Hospital in
Taipei, according to its inventor Chang Jung-sen, a professor from
the National Central University.</P>
      <P>Chang said the chip can diagnose meningitis and identify the
strain of bacterium causing it within 24 hours.</P>
      <P>There are twenty to thirty bacterium which can cause the disease,
which is common in Taiwan and Japan. The Galaxy chip can detect about
80 percent to 90 percent of them, according to its inventor.</P>
      <P>The current method of diagnosing meningitis is through
examination of the cerebrospinal fluid, a process that takes between
three days and one week. It is not unusual for patients to die before
the test results become available, said Chang.</P>

(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy in July flashed a blue
light, representing recession in the country's official rating
system, an official of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) said Monday.</P>
      <P>It was the eighth consecutive month that the island's economy had
flashed a blue light, the rating system's worst situation.</P>
      <P>In the CEPD-devised five-color system, a red light signifies an
overheated economy, yellow-red indicates that the economy is heating
up, green reflects steady growth, yellow-blue signals economic
sluggishness, and blue represents recession.</P>
      <P>In applying the system, the CEPD measures nine major areas of
economic activity, including exports, industrial production, stock
index and orders placed in the manufacturing field.</P>
      <P>The CEPD official said that all nine areas registered blue lights
in July, indicating that the prospects of an early economic recovery
remain bleak.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the official noted that Taiwan's leading economic
index for July stood at 92.8, up a 0.1 percentage point over the
preceding month.</P>
      <P>He said that the decline in some areas of the index have slowed
down, creating a better chance for recovery, but added that the
movement in the next few months will be key to predicting the
economy's future.</P>

      <P>Reported imminent exercises to be held by
the People's Liberation Army (PLA) along the coast of eastern
Guangdong Province will be routine annual drills, Taiwan's Ministry
of National Defense (MND) said Monday.</P>
      <P>The MND made the remark in response to a Hong Kong-based

probably hold a military exercises in Shantou, on a scale similar to
that of an exercise held recently on Dongshan Island off the coast of
Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>The Wen Wei Pao daily said the exercise will be characterized by
drills relating to anti-landing, anti-air raid, electronic
interference and anti-electronic interference, satellite
reconnaissance and anti-blockade.</P>
      <P>MND officials noted that Beijing often exaggerates the scale of
mainland Chinese military exercises in an attempt to attain its
propaganda goals.</P>
      <P>For example, they said, the scale of the just-ended Dongshan
Island exercise was "not large," but Beijing media reported that
100,000 troops took part.</P>
      <P>The officials urged the people of Taiwan to heighten their

      <P>Taiwan's exports to mainland China

last year, according to statistics released Monday by the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>An official of the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) under the MOEA

many months -- to the global economic slowdown that has began to

      <P>In an attempt to dispel opposition to his
parole, a jailed sexual offender has offered to undergo treatment to
reduce his libido, a prison instructor said Monday.</P>
      <P>The offender made headlines earlier this month for passing the
Joint University Entrance Examination and gaining admittance to
National Taiwan University, which is the first choice of most high
school students.</P>
      <P>However, the possible release on parole of the sexual offender,
who was convicted of dozens of sexual attacks against female
university students, caused hot debate over the appropriateness of
releasing a serial sexual offender back among the people upon whom he
used to prey.</P>
      <P>The offender, whose name has been withheld by the Ministry of
Justice (MOJ), has served six years of a 16-year jail term and is
therefore eligible for parole, said a MOJ official.</P>
      <P>But the public concern over his past offenses has put a lot of
pressure on the MOJ, which is due to deliberate the offender's parole
before local universities begin their autumn semesters in September.</P>
      <P>An official at the Taipei Prison, where the man is incarcerated,

      <P>The spokesman for the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT), Taiwan's largest political party, said Monday that President
Chen Shui-bian should respect the views of the KMT when he forms a
coalition government.</P>
      <P>Chen pledged at the end of the Economic Development Advisory
Conference (EDAC) Sunday that regardless of the results of December's
legislative elections, he will form a coalition government to
stabilize the political situation.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Wang Chih-kang told reporters that his party
affirmed Chen's remarks, but added that the president must respect
the largest party in the Legislative Yuan when forming the coalition
government.</P>
      <P>Otherwise, Wang noted, "disputes between the government and the
Legislative Yuan will arise frequently."</P>
      <P>In order to resolve the problems relating to political
instability, he went on, "respecting the majority in the Legislative
Yuan is a prerequisite for forming a coalition government."</P>
      <P>Regarding the form of the proposed coalition government, Wang
said that "it must be decided through negotiations of all parties."</P>
      <P>In this connection, ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairman Frank Hsieh said in Kaohsiung that the successful convening

      <P>Commenting on Chen's statement about forming a coalition
government, he said that the DPP "would not exclude such a
possibility."</P>
      <P>However, he pointed out that "whether the coalition government
can be formed and what form it should take will depend on the results

      <P>"Party cooperation is the precondition for the successful

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) spokesman Wang
Chih-kang expressed regret Monday that the Economic Development
Advisory Conference (EDAC) failed to endorse the so-called "1992
consensus" on the "one China" issue.</P>
      <P>The "1992 consensus" allows both sides of the Taiwan Strait to
make their own interpretations as to the meaning of "one China."</P>
      <P>It formed the basis for quasi-official dialogue between Taipei's
Straits Exchange Foundation and Beijing's Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait until bilateral negotiations came to a
complete standstill in July 1999.</P>
      <P>Wang said at a press conference that the KMT affirmed the
convening of the EDAC and its success in reaching consensus on 322
items, including a relaxation of the "go slow, be patient" policy,
which regulates Taiwan's trade with and investment in mainland China.</P>
      <P>However, the KMT spokesman stated that his party regrets that the

accession to the WTO, the KMT highly affirms the easing of the `go

open direct transport links with mainland China and lift
long-standing curbs on trade with and investment in the mainland,
Tung said Hong Kong will suffer as a result, but only in the short
term.</P>
      <P>However, Tung said, Taiwan's dismantling of the barriers to trade
with mainland China will facilitate reunification of the "homeland,"
and Hong Kong will support whatever measures are conducive to
national reunification.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hong Kong Financial Secretary Antony Leung Kam-chung
said he is pleased to see Taiwan changing tack and added that the new
measures will promote economic and cultural exchanges between the two
sides of Taiwan Strait, which, he said, is in the interest of all
Chinese.</P>
      <P>Leung admitted that local land and air carriers will bear the
brunt of the impact, since Hong Kong will lose its importance as the
gateway to and from mainland China for millions Taiwan visitors every
year in the absence of direct links between the mainland and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, Hong Kong's status as the financial center for the whole
of Asia, especially for mainland China and Taiwan, will be
strengthened in the long term, Leung went on.</P>
      <P>The closer economic integration of mainland China, Taiwan and
Hong Kong will boost the prosperity in the Greater Chinese area,
Leung said.</P>

      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
met Monday with David Peterson, president of the U.S.-based NRG
Energy, Inc., at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>NRG Energy Inc. and Hsin Yu Cogeneration Co., Ltd., a local
company based at the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park entered
into an agreement under which NRG will provide NT$5 billion (US$143
million) in capital investment to build a cogeneration plant at the
park and another at the Tainan Science-based Industrial Park to
supply electricity for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp.,
United Microelectronics Co. and other major electronic companies.</P>
      <P>Peterson told Chen that the semiconductor industry in Taiwan will
continue to lead the world and that a stable power supply is
essential for a nation seeking economic development. Peterson also
expressed the hope that Taiwan will open up more of its power market
to foreign investors.</P>
      <P>NRG Energy Inc. is the second-largest private power supplier in
the United States and the fifth-largest in the world. Its current
capacity is capable of producing 22 megawatts -- almost equal to
Taiwan's total consumption.</P>

registered a year-on-year increase of 2.4 percent in July, according

mainly to the recession and the effect of Typhoon Toraji on Taiwan.</P>

significantly by 20.3 percent in the same month compared with the

      <P>The United States on Monday welcomed
the decision of President Chen Shui-bian's government to ease
restrictions on cross-strait investment in mainland China and to
adopt a more aggressive policy, which is favored by most Taiwan
business leaders.</P>
      <P>"We believe improving cross-strait economic ties serves the
interest of both Taiwan and the People's Republic of China and is
conducive to peace and security in the region," a State Department
official said.</P>
      <P>"With that in mind, we welcome recent proposals by Taiwan's
economic advisory conference to expand cross-strait economic ties,"
he said.</P>
      <P>"Our abiding interest is a peaceful resolution of differences in
a manner acceptable to the people on both sides of the Strait," the
official said, adding that Washington believes dialogue is the best
way to achieve such a resolution.</P>
      <P>On Sunday, President Chen promised to formulate new policies
within two weeks based on the recommendations offered by the Economic
Development Advisory Conference, which included lifting the US$50
million ceiling on any single Taiwanese investment in mainland China

by what has become commonplace in Taiwan politics -- gifts of money
or goods in exchange for votes.</P>
      <P>"We are determined to make every possible effort to wipe out
vote-buying in the December elections. We'll investigate any
suspected vote-buying case regardless of party affiliation and social
status of those involved," Chang said.</P>

critical to instilling public confidence in the results of the
elections. He also said that a transparent election process is

      <P>The government is planning to develop the
economic processing zones (EPZs) in Kaohsiung and Taichung into
industrial parks for high value-added manufacturing and services,
according to EPZ administration director Chou Yen.</P>
      <P>Chou said that manufacturing industrial companies now account for
less than 40 percent of the businesses in the EPZs, as compared with
51 percent in 1998. Increasing numbers of companies involved in
international trade, services, high-technology, logistics and the
warehousing and transportation sectors are headquartered in the EPZs,
he added.</P>
      <P>At the Economic Development Advisory Conference last week, the
participants reached recommendations by consensus to promote direct
transportation links between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and

transshipment center project will help the EPZs attracting more

arrived at the Republic of China's frontline island of Kinmen via a
direct voyage Tuesday to preside over the opening of a trade fair.</P>
      <P>This was the largest mainland group to sail directly across the
short distance in the Taiwan Strait since the ROC government opened
direct trade, mail and shipping links between its two offshore
defense outposts of Kinmen and Matsu and mainland China's Xiamen and
Mawei ports in Fujian province, commonly known as the "mini three
links," at the beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>The mission followed the arrival of a shipment of mainland
Chinese consumer products Monday to be displayed at the First
Jinjiang Trade Fair scheduled to open at the Kinmen Stadium Friday.</P>
      <P>The shipment comprised 138 categories of consumer products
manufactured by 52 blue-chip firms in the Jinjiang area in Fujian
province which lies opposite Taiwan. It was the first batch of
mainland consumer goods to be legally imported to Kinmen since the
opening of the "mini three links."</P>
      <P>Wang said upon his arrival in Kinmen that he is very pleased to
see the "mini three links" enter a new stage of legal merchandise
trade.</P>
      <P>"We hope the upcoming trade fair will help boost commercial and
civilian exchanges between Kinmen and Jinjiang for the benefits of
residents in both regions," Wang said.</P>
      <P>For his part, Kinmen Deputy Magistrate Yen Ta-jen said the county
government has long hoped to legally import mainland consumer goods.
"We hope the Aug. 31-Sept. 2 Jinjiang trade fair will set a model for
future cross-strait commercial exchanges," he added.</P>
      <P>As Kinmen lies far closer to Fujian than to Taiwan, many mainland
products have been smuggled into Kinmen over the past years, despite
intensive coast guard patrols.</P>
      <P>A second trade delegation from Jinjiang, to be held by Zheng
Zungjie, director of the external trade and economic cooperation
department under the Fujian provincial government, is scheduled to
arrive in Kinmen Thursday to attend the grand opening of the trade
fair.</P>
      <P>Mainland products to be displayed in the show will include
footwear, furniture, toys, garments, consumer electronics and
construction materials and interior decorations.</P>
      <P>As mainland China has been reluctant to throw its full support
behind the Taiwan-initiated "mini three links," it still does not
allow regular direct Kinmen-Xiamen and Matsu-Mawei shipping services
and instead reviews such applications on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>Kinmen County Government sources said the forthcoming Jinjiang
trade fair may mark a change in mainland China's attitude toward the
"mini three links."</P>
      <P>"Anyway, we hope that the 'mini three links' can make headway
after the trade fair to help pave the way for opening of full-fledged
trade, communication and transportation links across the Taiwan
Strait," said Kinmen Deputy Magistrate Yen.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 28 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Thanks to a recycling campaign, the people
of Taiwan are now producing less garbage, with per capita garbage
production falling from 1.07 kilograms per day in 1999 to 0.939
kilograms in 2000, the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH)
reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>DOH officials said the nearly 10 percent fall was the first
negative growth of its kind in a decade and they attributed the
progress to the recycling efforts of local governments across the
island.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, garbage generation was largely
reduced in Taipei, Kaohsiung and Taichung cities, thanks to a series
of measures, including garbage recycling and classification, carried
out in Taiwan's three largest cities. They added that Taiwan's
garbage will be further reduced after all counties and cities on the
island begin promoting similar complementary measures.</P>
      <P>About 8.45 million metric tons of garbage were collected in
Taiwan in 1999, 219,000 metric tons of which, or 2.6 percent of the
total, were recycled. With the implementation of the recycling
campaign at the beginning of 2000, Taiwan cleaned up 7.88 million
metric tons of garbage last year, with the recycling rate rising to
6.5 percent, or 470,000 metric tons, according to DOH tallies.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
declined to comment Tuesday on a U.S. magazine report that Taiwan can
build diesel-powered submarines on its own, so long as it can acquire
certain sophisticated components and parts.</P>
      <P>MND officials said it is the ministry's established policy to
refrain from talking about weaponry acquisition affairs in public.</P>
      <P>A report carried in the latest issue of Defense News weekly
quoted former Taiwan defense officials as having said that if Taiwan
can receive certain technical assistance and precision components and
parts, it would be able to build diesel-fueled submarines.</P>
      <P>The report further said that the U.S. military has formed a
special task force to study how to help the Republic of China acquire
new diesel submarines.</P>
      <P>The U.S. government approved a US$4 billion arms sales package to
Taiwan earlier this year, including 12 P-3C Orion reconnaissance
aircraft, four Kidd-class frigates and eight diesel submarines.
However, the United States has not produced diesel submarines for
many years and countries that still produce this kind of warship,
including Germany and the Netherlands, have rejected proposals to
cooperate with the United States in providing Taiwan with the
submarines.</P>
      <P>Responding to the report, military sources said that although
Taiwan's defense technology has reached a certain level and its
state-owned China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) is capable of building
warships, Taiwan would still have to obtain foreign technology
transfers and would have to import certain sophisticated components
and parts, if it wants to build submarines on its own.</P>
      <P>A military expert, who preferred anonymity, also said that
although the CSBC has experience in building warships for the ROC

    <HEADLINE>KMT, NP TIE-UP FOR YEAR-END ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and its
ally, the New Party (NP), entered a cooperation pact Tuesday by
agreeing to jointly field a candidate in the Taipei County magistrate
election -- expected to be one of the most hotly contested
battlefields in Taiwan's year-end elections.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien Chan met with NP head Hsieh Chi-tah Tuesday
after months of seeking an integration of members and supporters of
the KMT and its two splinter parties -- the People First Party (PFP)
and the NP -- to form a so-called "pan-blue force" that will
cooperate rather than compete against each other in the year-end
legislative, mayoral and county chief elections.</P>
      <P>PFP Chairman James Soong announced last Friday that the PFP will
not enter candidates for the Taipei and Kaohsiung County magistrate
elections as a result of the KMT's reluctance to cooperate with his
party with regard to candidate selection.</P>
      <P>Soong, formerly a Taiwan provincial governor and a KMT
secretary-general, said he was saddened by the KMT grassroots party
workers' reluctance to throw their support behind any of the
PFP-proposed candidates for the mayoral and magistrate elections
scheduled for Dec. 1.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, Lien and Hsieh reached a consensus that the KMT and
the NP will jointly decide by conducting a public opinion poll on
which candidate from the "pan-blue force" will be fielded to run for
the seat of the Taipei county chief.</P>
      <P>The poll results will be used to gauge which candidate -- either
the KMT's Lin Chih-chia or the NP's Wang Chien-shuan -- has the best
chance of winning.</P>
      <P>After the meeting, Hsieh said the KMT-NP cooperative formula can
be applied to all cities and counties around the island to choose the
best possible candidates from the "pan-blue force."</P>
      <P>According to Wang Chih-kang, a KMT spokesman, Lien still pegs
high expectations on the scenario that the KMT, the PFP and the NP
will cooperate to as to allow them to compete shoulder-to-shoulder
against the ruling Democratic Progressive Party in the crucial
elections.</P>
      <P>Both Lin and Wang support the idea of finalizing the candidate
through an opinion poll of KMT and NP supporters, but they ruled out
the possibility of teaming up with someone else to run for deputy
Taipei county chief if they were both rejected as county chief
material by the poll respondents.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei-based Chinese Federation of
Labor (CFL) attended the Asian regional meeting of the International
Labor Organization (ILO) held Tuesday in Bangkok, mainly because of
its work to protect foreign laborers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>CFL President Lin Hui-kuan led the Taiwan delegation to the
meeting in the name of observer of the International Confederation of
Free Trade Union (ICFTU). It was the first time that a Taiwan labor
group has been invited to participate in a meeting of the ILO, which
is an affiliate of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The CFL's participation in the meeting did not meet with any
objection from Beijing, as it attended as an observer of a non-U.N.
organization. Beijing opposes Taiwan's participation in any
international organization in which sovereignty is a prerequisite.</P>
      <P>Lin told CNA that the CFL gained high appraisal in its efforts to
protect the rights of Thai, Filipino, Indonesian and Vietnamese
workers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is the only country in Asia that allows foreign laborers
to enjoy the same salary levels as their local counterparts, which
elevates its image in international society, Lin added.</P>
      <P>He indicated that although Taiwan is not a U.N. member, it has
signed two international agreements related to labor affairs and
abides by all the regulations stipulated by the ILO.</P>
      <P>Recently, Lin added, the Republic of China government was about
to eliminate the minimum wage requirement for foreign workers mainly
due to pressure from the business sector. However, through the
protests of local labor groups, foreign laborers' working rights were
protected, bringing extra attention to the power of Taiwan labor
groups.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that Taiwan is one of the ICFTU founders and that its
participation in the ILO can serve as a model for Taiwan to take part
in international activities.</P>
      <P>Lin and his delegation are scheduled to return home Sept. 1 after
the quadrennial meeting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC, VIETNAM COOPERATE TO BUST CROSS-BORDER DRUG TRAFFICKING RING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Law enforcement officers in the Republic of
China and Vietnam have recently cooperated in breaking a cross-border
drug trafficking ring, the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau, a mastermind of the ring, identified as
Liu Kuo-hsing, was arrested in Ho Chi Minh City by Vietnamese police
authorities early this month.</P>
      <P>Quoting Vietnamese sources, a CIB official said Liu had extensive
connections with drug trafficking rings and dealers in Vietnam.
"Vietnamese police have detained Liu for further questioning and they
have agreed to repatriate him to Taiwan after they finish their
questioning," said the official.</P>
      <P>Acting on tips from international sources, local police managed
to nab several drug traffickers from Vietnam earlier this month.
Initial investigations show that the drug traffickers were
commissioned by Liu to smuggle contraband narcotics into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the past, drug trafficking rings used to smuggle illegal drugs
from the Golden Triangle to Taiwan via Thailand and mainland China,
but as police now monitor this trafficking channel closely, the CIB
official said, Liu's ring had moved its operation center to Vietnam
in recent years and had changed its transport route.</P>
      <P>"The ring first secured narcotics in mainland China's Yunan
province and then transported the goods to Vietnam by land for
airlifting to Taiwan via Hong Kong and Macau," the official
explained, adding that the ring had commissioned Taiwan tourists to
smuggle drugs into Taiwan in small installments by hiding them in
specially designed footwear and suits.</P>
      <P>CIB investigations show that the ring had used this new
trafficking formula to smuggle drugs into Taiwan more than 10 times.</P>
      <P>The official said Vietnam apparently has become a new springboard
for Taiwan-destined drug trafficking. "As criminal rings tend to use
individual tourists to help smuggle drugs into Taiwan in small
installments, it's not easy to bust them without tip-offs," he
admitted.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) will
benefit from a relaxed mainland investment policy, as the state-run
firm has gained approval from the Republic of China government to
purchase coal from mainland China to fuel its electricity generators.</P>
      <P>Taipower President Wu Ching-chi said the company has been allowed
to purchase more than one million tons of coal from the mainland for
power generation after having recently signed two year-long contracts
with mainland Chinese state-owned coal enterprises.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that Taipower had inked long-term contracts
for purchasing coal from the mainland, as it had previously only been
able to buy mainland coal on an order-by-order basis, he noted.</P>
      <P>Wu pointed out that transport costs from the mainland are cheaper
than those from Australia, which has long been a major supplier of
coal for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He added that mainland Chinese coal will be more competitive
after direct transport links are set up between Taiwan and the
mainland and revealed that Taipower is considering new contracts with
the mainland side should their deliveries prove stable and timely.</P>
      <P>Wu pointed out, however, that the ratio of mainland Chinese coal
cannot surpass 20 percent of the company's total consumption as fuel
diversification rules stipulate that the percentage of coal purchased
from other countries cannot exceed 35 percent of the total, which has
recently been revised downward from the previous level of 40 percent.</P>
      <P>Taipower currently needs 22 million tons of coal for power
generation per year, so the company can buy three million tons of
coal from mainland China based on the 20 percent ceiling, he
explained.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian is happy to see
the convening of cross-party negotiations initiated by opposition
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan, Presidential Secretary-General You
Hsi-kun said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"The president is not only happy to see the convening of the
inter-party negotiations to be attended by the chiefs of all parties,
but he will also extend his all-out support," You told reporters.</P>
      <P>You said that the consensus reached at the just-concluded
Economic Development Advisory Conference (EDAC) proved far better
than originally expected.</P>
      <P>"It has not only established a new strategy for the development
of the country's economy, but has also laid the foundation for
cooperation between the parties," he noted.</P>
      <P>You said that he understood Lien and People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong want to convene cross-party negotiations after
the EDAC, and added that Chen "is happy to support the plan."</P>
      <P>However, he went on, the Presidential Office could not make a
"concrete response" to the proposal at present as it "does not
understand the concept" of the inter-party talks.</P>
      <P>If the nature of the talks is defined as inter-party
negotiations, You said that they would be better represented by party
leaders because Chen is not a member of the Democratic Progressive
Party Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>He went on to point out that if the talks are designed to
implement the agreements reached at the EDAC, it seems appropriate to
consider the participation of the premier, vice premier and relevant
Cabinet ministers, as they will be responsible for the implementation
of the EDAC-approved proposals.</P>
      <P>In this regard, Kuo Yao-chi, director of the Public Affairs
Office under the Presidential Office, said that the president is glad
to see the development of all matters which are helpful to the
harmony of the parties and the country's economic development.</P>
      <P>"If the president's presence at the inter-party negotiations will
produce constructive significance, he will be happy to attend," Kuo
stated.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Wang Chih-kang said a day earlier that his party
hopes that the cross-party negotiations can be held within two weeks
to discuss the implementation of the proposals reached at the EDAC.</P>
      <P>The KMT's idea is to bring together the chiefs of the KMT, the

    <HEADLINE>PRC STEPS UP DEPLOYMENT OF MISSILES TARGETING TAIWAN: PENTAGON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  28  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China has stepped up its
deployments of short-range missiles opposite Taiwan, with the latest
number of missiles within range of Taiwan exceeding 350, the
Washington Times reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz was quoted by the
paper as describing the mainland Chinese missile buildup as
"destabilizing."</P>
      <P>New missile deployments were discovered recently by U.S.
intelligence agencies at Yongan in Fujian Province and at Jiangshan,
located about 384 kilometers southwest of Shanghai. Yongan is the
base used by mainland Chinese military forces to test-fire missiles,
while Jiangshan is an existing base disclosed for the first time as a
missile site, according to the Washington Times report.</P>
      <P>The U.S. intelligence agencies discovered that mainland China
added more than 30 new CSS-6 and CSS-7 missiles within range of
Taiwan recently, according to the report.</P>
      <P>The mainland military is adding 50 new missiles a year at the
current rate, the report indicated.</P>
      <P>"They (the PRC military) have been doing that steadily for a
number of years now," Wolfowitz said in an interview with the
Washington Times.</P>
      <P>The missile deployments contradict mainland China's commitment to
a 1982 communique with the United States that says Beijing's
fundamental policy is a "peaceful resolution" of its differences with
Taiwan, Wolfowitz said.</P>
      <P>"And I don't see that building up your missiles is part of a
fundamental policy of peaceful unification," he added.</P>
      <P>Any attempt by mainland China to intimidate Taiwan will fail, he
continued, because the United States is firmly resolved to prevent
the forcible reunification of the island with the mainland.</P>
      <P>The latest deployments put the total number of short-range
missile within range of Taiwan at 350, an increase of 50 missiles
since the spring, the Washington Times report said.</P>
      <P>The PRC has three other short-range missile bases within range of
Taiwan. They include the missile brigade headquarters at Leping and
one at Nanping, about 368 kilometers from Taiwan, the Washington
Times quoted a U.S. military intelligence agency as stating.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN: U.S. ARMS SALES SHOULD NOT BECOME ISSUE-MAKING LICENSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan said here Tuesday that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan "should not
become an issue-making license."</P>
      <P>`</P>
      <P>Lien also said that the two sides of Taiwan Strait should open
consultations on the basis of the so-called "1992 consensus" to
restart dialogue and exchanges so as to secure a stable cross-strait
situation.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks while meeting members of the Asian
fact-finding Mission of the U.S. Conservative Caucus, a U.S. think
tank.</P>
      <P>Lien also called on the United States to avoid being biased to
either side in its relations with Taipei and Beijing, and he noted
that positive cross-strait dialogue and exchanges correspond to U.S.
policy.</P>
      <P>Lien said that the Taiwan Strait and the Korean peninsula have
become two major potential flashpoints in Northeast Asia. This
situation, he went on, not only affects the security and safety of
Taiwan but also that of the Asian region and even the whole world.</P>
      <P>Touching on the rapid economic development in mainland China,
Lien said that Taiwan should deal with this problem realistically. He
added that although mainland China has maintained rapid economic
growth in past years, the situation there is very complicated because
Beijing faces daily-widening gaps between rich and poor and between
coastal and inland areas, as well as increasing unemployment.</P>
      <P>He further pointed out that this situation provides Taiwan, the
United States and other Asian countries with a chance to help the
mainland China transform itself into a stable nation through
economic, cultural and social exchanges.</P>
      <P>Lien stressed that peace across the Taiwan Strait cannot be built
on military confrontation and that the cross-strait problem stems
chiefly from differences in the social systems on either side.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan has always purchased U.S. arms for defensive
purposes and added that the arms are used to maintain the security of
the Taiwan Strait, not to provoke Beijing. He stressed that the KMT
treasures greatly the U.S.-Taiwan relationship.</P>
      <P>Lien also reiterated that the "eventual goal" of the KMT's
mainland China policy is to build a democratic, free and equal
unified China.</P>
      <P>He also said that Taiwan's peaceful transition of power has
successfully exploded the myth that democracy is unsuitable for Asian
people. It has also proved that democratic values are universal and
that time is on the side of the Chinese people.</P>

      <P>Domestic manufacturers who lay their
laborers off illegally and en masse might face government
administrative penalties, including a ban on leaving the country,
sources from the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Manufacturers who dismiss their workers en masse in contravention
of government regulations will be dealt with under the terms of a
CLA-initiated anti-mass layoff bill, which is expected to be approved
by the Executive Yuan next month, CLA officials said.</P>
      <P>According to the terms of the bill, violators will be liable to
penalties ranging from a ban on leaving the country, sanctions on the
manufacturers' schedules to become a listed company or an

foreign workers from abroad, and harsher demands for their
applications to invest in or relocate their operations to mainland
China.</P>
      <P>The bill, which will be part of the Republic of China
Administrative Process Law, stipulates that manufacturers should
inform their labor unions or employee representatives 90 days before
any mass layoff takes effect.</P>

government at the same time and should provide a comprehensive layoff
plan indicating reasons, timetable, number of people involved and

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Oil companies in Taiwan and mainland China
are evaluating the viability of joint exploration of potential oil
reserves in the Taiwan Strait, a Taiwan oil official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chiu Chi-hsiung, vice president of Taiwan's state-run Chinese
Petroleum Corp. (CPC), confirmed that CPC and mainland China's China
National Offshore Oil Co. (CNOOC) have been cooperating for years in
geological oil research in maritime areas close to Chaozhou and
Shantou districts, Guangdong Province, and in Taiwan's southern
Tainan Basin.</P>
      <P>Chiu added that as the geological research shows that there are
potential oil reserves there, the two companies are considering
expending more capital to do real exploration.</P>
      <P>According to the official, exploring for a single well costs
around US$10 million.</P>
      <P>Since the Republic of China government still has not relaxed its
"no haste, be patient" policy that restricts local investment in
mainland China, the two companies may set up a new company in a third
place such as Singapore to handle the exploration work.</P>
      <P>Chiu said the project will be sent to the Cabinet for approval,
after which, the two companies might sign a contract to undertake
further exploration.</P>
      <P>The CPC official said the new contract will be signed on the
basis of equality and mutual benefit and will not involve issues of

    <HEADLINE>AIT OFFICIAL: WISDOM REQUIRED TO HANDLE `1992 CONSENSUS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Raymond Burghardt, director of the Taipei
Office of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), said Tuesday that
"wisdom is required" for both Taiwan and mainland China to handle the
problem regarding the so-called "1992 consensus."</P>
      <P>The consensus said by some to have been reached in 1992
discussions allows both sides of the Taiwan Strait to make their own
interpretations as to the meaning of "one China."</P>
      <P>It formed the basis for Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation and
Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait to
engage in quasi-official negotiations until July 1999, when bilateral
dialogue came to a complete standstill.</P>
      <P>Burghardt, a veteran diplomat who was about to assume a new post
as U.S. ambassador to Vietnam, was asked his opinions on the
development of cross-strait relations during a meeting with members
of the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei.</P>
      <P>He said that the so-called "1992 consensus" was not a
"consensus," but an "agreement" reached by the two sides.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan and the mainland were able to discuss pragmatic issues
by shelving their controversies through the 1992 interactions,
Burghardt pointed out that "the two sides of the Taiwan Strait need
wisdom to reopen negotiations based on that foundation."</P>
      <P>Talking about the mainland's military threat to Taiwan, the AIT
official noted that the mainland is unlikely to take military action
against Taiwan, saying that such action would hurt the mainland's
international image and that Beijing is aware that the United States
is obliged to provide Taiwan with defensive arms required for the
island's security.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET APPROVES PROPOSAL TO HALVE LAND VALUE INCREMENT TAX</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet approved a proposal Wednesday
to halve the land value increment tax, a capital gains tax for
property transactions, for two years.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet passed the proposal, strongly advocated by major
commerce and industry associations amid the lingering domestic
economic doldrums, at its weekly meeting.</P>
      <P>The proposal is pending approval by the Legislative Yuan. Premier
Chang Chun-hsiung directed the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) to
consult with the legislature to facilitate the implementation of the
tax-cut proposal.</P>
      <P>As the land value increment tax is basically a local tax, Premier
Chang said the central government will reimburse local-level
governments for their financial losses resulting from the proposed
two-year tax cut.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang ordered the MOF and the DGBAS to draft revisions
to the existing law to authorize the government to float state bonds
to raise funds to compensate local-level governments.</P>
      <P>Chang pointed out that the two-year reduction of the land value
increment tax was a "majority opinion" adopted at the just-concluded
Economic Development Advisory Conference.</P>
      <P>Quoting an MOF analysis, the premier said although the proposed
tax reduction may result in a decrease in government tax revenues,
the move is expected to help buoy the recession-hit local property
market and stimulate overall economic development.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Chang said, the Cabinet has decided to
accept the proposal to slash the land value increment tax by 50
percent for two years.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet's decision immediately drew mixed reaction from
various social quarters. While bankers and business executives
generally welcomed the proposal, some opposition lawmakers claimed
that the proposal was an expedient measure in favor of large business
groups at the expense of ordinary people.</P>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), which controls a majority
in the current legislature, generally supports the two-year,
50-percent cut in the land value increment tax.</P>
      <P>KMT Vice Chairman Vincent Siew, also a former premier, said the
tax reduction would help stimulate the slumping property market and
help local banks resolve serious bad debts issues.</P>
      <P>"We believe that it could be an effective measure to cope with
our current economic woes," Siew said, adding that in the long run,
the government should take advantage of the "two-year reprieve" to
overhaul Taiwan's taxation system.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
legislative caucus said it basically backs the proposal. But the
caucus' secretary-general, Tsai Huang-lan, said some DPP lawmakers
still oppose the proposal. "We hope that MOF and DGBAS official will
explain whether it is suitable to issue state bonds to make up for
financial losses from the proposed tax cut," he noted.</P>
      <P>Liu Tai-ying, chairman of China Development Industrial Bank, said
he fully supports the tax reduction proposal because it would boost
property transactions and thus help local banks lower their
non-performing loan ratios.</P>
      <P>Chuang Meng-han, an associate professor at Tamkang University,
said Taiwan is the only country in the world that has implemented the
land value increment tax system.</P>
      <P>"It's an unreasonable taxation system," Chuang said, adding that
the government should replace the tax with a "property transaction
income tax."</P>
      <P>In contrast, the tiny opposition New Party voiced it strong
opposition to the tax-cut proposal.</P>
      <P>New Party legislative caucus whip Ying Chih-hung said at a news
conference that the tax-cut proposal was just a "majority opinion" of
the Aug. 24-26 economic conference, not a "consensus opinion."</P>
      <P>"I simply can't understand why the Cabinet should want to rush
the decision to put the proposal into practice," Ying said, adding
that the quick move signified that the current Democratic Progressive
Party-led administration is leaning toward large business groups at
the expense of social justice.</P>
      <P>Ying said Taiwan needs a sweeping taxation reform, not a biased
tax cut. He said the New Party will do its utmost to block the
passage of the proposal in the legislature, which will open its new
session in mid-September.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LESSONS FROM SWISSAIR FLIGHT 111 TRAGEDY: IMPROVE WIRING SYSTEMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Aug.  28  (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada's Transportation Safety Board
looking into the crash of Swissair flight 111 three years ago issued
three recommendations Tuesday to improve airline safety, saying
current fire prevention systems are not good enough.</P>
      <P>The jet went down on Sept. 2, 1998 in the Atlantic Ocean near
Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia, killing all 229 people on the flight. The
board found evidence of fire in the ceiling of the plane, near the
cockpit. One possible source could have been damaged wires in the
aircraft's in-flight entertainment system, according to
investigators.</P>
      <P>The Canadian investigators' recommendations include toughening
the flammability standards for all materials used in airplanes, not
just walls and seat cushions as is currently the case.</P>
      <P>"Often in places where there are few, if any, defenses in terms
of fire detection and suppression, you can find various materials
that can sustain a fire. And these materials don't just burn; they
can also emit toxic gases and excessive amounts of smoke," said board
chairperson Benoit Bouchard.</P>
      <P>The board also called for a more stringent certification standard
for electrical wires. It said standards should include more realistic
testing covering all the ways wires can fail.</P>
      <P>Lastly, the board recommended that all systems be evaluated in
terms of their impact on an in-flight fire. It noted current systems
can aggravate fires in progress, turning a minor scare into a
full-blown tragedy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH CALLS FOR PROGRAMS TO COMBAT RACIAL DISCRIMINATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Johannesburg, Aug. 28 (CNA)
(By Jer-shong Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Human Rights Watch said Tuesday that
it expects the upcoming U.N.-sponsored World Conference against
Racism to lead to concrete programs to combat racial discrimination
around the world.</P>
      <P>The U.N. World Conference against Racism will be held in the
South African eastern city of Durban from Aug. 31 to Sept. 7.</P>
      <P>Human Rights Watch said "racism today is a pervasive problem
which affects every society. The organization expects governments to
commit to concrete national and global programs to stamp out racism
in all its forms."</P>
      <P>The human rights organization said "victims of racism around the
world expect more than empty talk -- they expect action."</P>
      <P>Reed Brody, advocacy director of Human Rights Watch, said in
Durban "this meeting needs to offer something to the refugee in
Europe who is beaten up simply because he is a 'foreigner,' to the
scavenger in India whose low caste prevents him from rising in life,
to the Tibetan tortured by (Communist) Chinese police, to the
Palestinian under Israeli occupation, and to the African-American
child who is three times as likely to live in poverty as her white
counterpart."</P>
      <P>Human Rights Watch called on the government of India to drop its
insistence that the issue of caste discrimination be kept out of the
meeting's final declaration, despite an unprecedented international
mobilization around the issue.</P>
      <P>"More than 250 million people worldwide suffer under a hidden
apartheid of segregation, modern-day slavery, and other extreme forms
of discrimination because they were born into a marginalized caste,"
said Smita Narula, senior researcher with Human Rights Watch. "Caste
discrimination has been a shameful secret for too long, but an
emerging global movement will not let it be hidden any longer."</P>
      <P>Human Rights Watch also said it hoped that the conference would:</P>
      <P>-- Call for reparations to address the continuing effects of
slavery, segregation, and other extreme forms of racism. Human Rights
Watch has proposed the creation of truth commissions to examine how a
government's past racist practices contribute to contemporary
deprivation and to propose methods of redress;</P>
      <P>-- Recognize discrimination against refugees, asylum seekers,
migrants, and internally displaced persons as a contemporary form of
racism and call on governments to reverse practices that discriminate
against refugees, asylum seekers, and migrants and to reaffirm their
commitment to the U.N. Refugee Convention;</P>
      <P>-- Address the issue of racial discrimination in the conferring,
denying and stripping of citizenship;</P>
      <P>-- Recommend measures to identify and to remedy the racist effect
of law or practice in the administration of justice, even in the
absence of racist intent.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan Aboriginal group took part in a
United Nation meeting on indigenous peoples and affairs held recently
in Geneva, marking the first time that Taiwan indigenous people had
attended such a UN gathering.</P>
      <P>Six Taiwan Aboriginal people, headed by Yang Chih-wei, chairman
of the Association for Taiwan Indigenous People's Policies,
participated in the meeting of the UN Working Group of Indigenous
People (UNWGIP) held July 25-28.</P>
      <P>Yang said his group was able to take part in the UNWGIP meeting
by saying that they were from "Formosa," rather than Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Over the past four year, Yang said, Taiwan Aboriginal groups have
been barred from the annual UNWGIP meeting because of Beijing's
intervention.</P>
      <P>Yang held a news conference Tuesday to explain the messages that
his group delivered at the four-day UNWGIP meeting.</P>
      <P>The six Taiwan delegates are from the indigenous tribes of Tsou,
Paiwan, Amis, Pazeh and Saidek.</P>
      <P>This year's UNWGIP meeting, according to Yang, focused on
marginalization, racism, poverty and other pressing problems faced by
the estimated 300 million members of indigenous groups throughout the
world.</P>

from their counterparts in the rest of the world in how they go about
securing their rights and protecting their interests.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, indigenous people rely on the government for their

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN REITERATES DESIRE TO ATTEND APEC SUMMIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  29  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reiterated his
desire Wednesday to personally attend this year's informal leadership
meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic cooperation (APEC) forum to be
held in Shanghai in late October.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed his desire during a meeting with two visiting U.S.
congressmen -- Rep. Joseph M. Hoeffel and Rep. Peter King.</P>
      <P>Noting that the annual APEC informal leadership meeting could be
a "window on opportunity," Chen said it could provide a good setting
for the top leaders of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to sit don
to talk.</P>
      <P>"I earnestly hopes to attend the meeting in person," Chen said,
adding that the Republic of China should enjoy the same rights and
should fulfill the same obligations as other APEC members based on
the principles of equality.</P>
      <P>Chen further said that as a member of the international
community and the Global Village, the ROC should be given the
opportunity to fulfill its obligations and duties.</P>
      <P>APEC, a regional forum dedicated to promote free trade,
investment and economic cooperation, is one of the few
multilateral organizations that simultaneously admits Taiwan and
mainland China. However, due to Beijing's opposition, the ROC
president has been barred from attend the annual APEC summit in
person and has instead had to name a proxy to attend the meeting on
his behalf.</P>
      <P>President Chen has on many occasion expressed his strong desire
to travel to Shanghai to attend this year's APEC summit, but
mainland Chinese authorities have so far turned a cold shoulder to
the proposal.</P>
      <P>During his talks with the American lawmakers, Chen also said
that the just-concluded Economic Development Advisory Conference
was the first cross-party conference on national affairs since
he assumed office in the ROC's historic transition of power
between different political parties in May 2000.</P>
      <P>"The Aug. 24-26 conference has managed to reached 322
'consensus proposals' on Taiwan's future economic development and
financial reform," Chen said, adding that he was satisfied
with the results of the meeting.</P>
      <P>Chen told his guests that the meeting has reached consensus on
adjusting Taiwan's policies on trade and investment in mainland
China. "The meeting marks an important watershed in our
national economic development and trade ties with mainland China,"
he stressed.</P>
      <P>Chen said he is convinced that the conference will contribute to
the upgrading of Taiwan's industrial development, financial reform,
job market and cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>"My administration is now working on concrete measures to
implement proposals reached at the conference," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S.: PLA MISSILE DEPLOYMENT A FACTOR IN CROSS-STRAIT BALANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  28  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. government indicated on
Tuesday that mainland China's missile threat against Taiwan will be
taken into account as the United States evaluates the military
balance across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"China's deployments obviously have an effect on how we see the
balance and stability of the situation there," said Richard Boucher,
spokesman for the State Department.</P>
      <P>Observers say that these remarks seem to indicate that the United
States will keep the missile threat in mind when decisions are made
on what type of security assistance to provide to Taiwan or on
whether to transfer missile defense technology to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Last week, Assistant Secretary of Defense Peter Rodman made a
more explicit linkage between the two.</P>
      <P>"A reasonable answer to make to them [Beijing] is, 'Well, the
missile defense is prompted by the fact that there are missiles,'" he
said.</P>
      <P>Beijing has expressed their strong objection to U.S. plans for
missile defense, and particularly to a shield that would cover
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Boucher said that he was restating what U.S. officials had told
Beijing on many occasions, including the meetings held between
Secretary of State Colin Powell and mainland Chinese leaders during
Powell's trip to Beijing in July.</P>
      <P>His comments came after the Washington Times reported that the
People's Liberation Army has stepped up deployments of short-range
missiles opposite Taiwan, with the number of missiles able to reach
the island totaling over 350.</P>
      <P>The spokesman would not discuss the details of any information
that the United States may have on these deployments.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INDIGENOUS ACTRESS ANNOUNCES BID TO RUN FOR LEGISLATIVE SEAT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  29 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Comely local movie and television actress
Chin Su-mei announced Wednesday her bid to run for a seat in the
Legislative Yuan representing indigenous people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Attired in a traditional ceremonial Atayal costume for women,
Chin said at a news conference marking the launch of her campaign
that she will run as an independent, rather than representing the
opposition People First Party as observers had previously speculated.</P>
      <P>Chin said she would add her Atayal mother's maiden surname of Kao
to her name for the election, which she described as a "gateway" for
her to fight for the rights and interests of her indigenous people.</P>
      <P>She will be the first indigenous woman to enter the legislative
elections in Taiwan history.</P>
      <P>The news conference kicked off a series of campaign drive
activities, which include the drinking of millet wine -- a
traditional drink for all indigenous people around the island.</P>
      <P>Chin was accompanied by her sister and members of the Taiwan
Entertainment Business Association during the news conference.</P>
      <P>Chin would become a Republic of China legislator representing
Aboriginal people if she wins 12,000 votes or more to beat seven
other rivals. Altogether, 11 Aboriginal people have entered the
December legislative elections, which have four seats up for grasps
exclusively for Aborigines.</P>
      <P>Chin gained fame as an actress eight years ago when she was cast
as the leading man's girlfriend in Oscar-winning director Ang Lee's
feature film "The Wedding Banquet," which won a top award at the
Berlin Film Festival in 1993.</P>
      <P>Chin once ran her own wedding studio in Taipei. The studio,
located on Chungshan North Road, was destroyed by fire several years
ago. She never reopened the business.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, after recovering from cancer surgery, she
started a cancer relief foundation to help cancer patients and their
families.</P>

      <P>While most Internet content providers and

    <HEADLINE>CPC EYEING HUGE MAINLAND CHINESE OIL MARKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 29 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC)
is planning to make inroads into mainland China by relocating part of
its distribution and sales operations across the Taiwan Strait, CPC
sources said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>CPC management is now working first to open gas stations and oil
storage tanks in port cities along the Yangtze River, the longest
river on the Chinese mainland, according to CPC officials.</P>
      <P>Under cut-throat competition at home after the Formosa Plastics
Group edged into Taiwan's oil market last September -- a move which
ended CPC's five-decade monopoly -- the CPC decided recently to "move
out," initially targeting mainland China's diesel oil markets, CPC
officials said.</P>
      <P>Before CPC actually branches out, however, the company will have
to obtain export permits from the Energy Commission under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, CPC officials said.</P>
      <P>CPC's announcement that it will seek to open operations in
mainland China was made known now only after the Republic of China
government began recently to ponder reviewing the "no haste, be
patient" policy devised years ago to curb rapidly expanding Taiwan
trade with and investment in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Actually CPC has already sold some 2,000 metric tons of liquefied
national gas (LNG) to Guangdong province earlier this year on a trial
basis via a Hong Kong-based agent, and CPC has "quietly" sold diesel
oil to mainland China over the last two years, also on a trial basis,
according to CPC officials.</P>
      <P>Last week, CPC struck a tentative accord with mainland China's
flagship petroleum company, the Beijing-based China National Offshore
Oil Corporation (CNOOC), to jointly explore for oil reserves in the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The agreement, only revived recently after a five-year hiatus,
features joint oil exploration in waters located southeast of the
mouth of mainland China's Zhujiang (Pearl River), according to CPC
sources.</P>
      <P>Encompassing 15,400 square kilometers, the targeted area
straddles the imaginary demarcation mid-line in the Taiwan Strait
that has been tacitly accepted by both Taipei and Beijing for
decades.</P>
      <P>If everything goes smoothly, a formal pact on the cross-strait
cooperation is expected to be signed by the end of this year, paving
the way for the two companies to launch formal exploratory drilling,
probably in 2002, CPC officials added.</P>
      <P>Under the initial contract, CPC and CNOOC will each contribute
US$500,000 for oil and LNG exploration in the targeted area, which
lies 250 kilometers south of the city of Swatow in the mainland
Chinese province of Guangdong.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW  FIGURES  SHOW  DENSE  POPULATION IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  29 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Population density in metropolitan Taipei
stood at 9,717 persons per square kilometer at the end of June, and
that of the port city Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan was even higher at
9,728, according to statistics compiled by the Environmental
Protection Administration under the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Dense population poses a heavy burden to the urban areas in
Taiwan. While the population density of the island at the end of June
was 619 persons per square kilometer, the population densities in
Taipei, Kaohsiung and 10 cities and counties in Taiwan were far above
1,000 per square kilometer.</P>
      <P>In general, the population densities in cities and counties along
the island's west coast were high, between 1,500 and 4,500 per square
kilometer, while in Taitung and Hualien counties in eastern Taiwan
the population densities were only 69 and 76 per square kilometer
respectively. The mountainous Nantou County's population density was
also comparatively lower, at 132 per square kilometer.</P>
      <P>In Taipei, as of the end of June there were 1,635,769 motor
vehicles on the streets, of which automobiles totaled 672,942 and the
rest were mostly motorcycles. In Kaohsiung, the number of motor
vehicles totaled 1,355,430, of which automobiles totaled 376,788.</P>
      <P>The numerous manufacturing factories around the island have
helped boost Taiwan's economy. However, they have become a major
burden to the environment.</P>
      <P>Though not many factories chose to locate in the cities, the
suburban areas surrounding such metropolitans as Taipei, Kaohsiung
and Taichung are favored as factory sites. At the end of June, there
were 26,858 factories in Taipei County and 10,706 in Taoyuan County
neighboring Taipei City. Surrounding Kaohsiung City, Kaohsiung County
had 4,874 factories and Tainan County 6,740. Taichung County and
Taichung City in central Taiwan combined had 17,841 factories.</P>
      <P>The government statistics showed that at the end of June there
were 97,500 factories in Taiwan, nearly three in every square
kilometer.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BUSINESS TURNOVER OF HSIP DROPS 13 PERCENT IN FIRST HALF-YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   29   (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Business volume at the Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park (HSIP) in the first half of this year
totaled NT$364.2 billion (US$10.3 billion), down 13 percent on a
year-on-year basis, according to statistics released recently by the
HSIP Administration.</P>
      <P>The administration attributed the fall to a global recession of
the IC industry, which is the backbone of the northern Taiwan hi-tech
industrial park.</P>
      <P>In terms of industry categories, the computer, IC, and
optoelectronics industries all registered decreases in their business
volume during the first six months, while the biotech,
telecommunications and precision machinery sectors posted noticeable
rises of 47 percent, 25 percent and 21 percent, respectively,
administration tallies show.</P>
      <P>The administration, however, pointed out that 59 firms based in
the HSIP still applied for capital increments in the first half,
channeling in NT$211.3 billion, up 2.1 percentage points from a year
ago. During the same period, 24 new companies with a combined capital
of NT$10.6 billion were established, a four-fold increase over the
year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>It forecast that the park's business turnover for the whole of
2001 will reach NT$800 billion based on the optimistic prediction
that the IC industry will regain momentum in the fourth quarter of
this year.</P>
      <P>In the other hand, the annual business volume of the biotech
companies headquartered in the HSIP is expected to grow by 100
percent for 2001, as the government has plans to invest NT$17.2
billion to promote the industry in the coming year, an official with
the park administration said.</P>
      <P>From the beginning of this year to the end of June, there were
305 firms based in the park, with a labor force of 101,510 workers, a
decrease of 1,330 workers from the year-earlier level, according to
administration tallies.</P>

      <P>Taipei police discovered more than 40,000
MDMA pills, commonly known as ecstasy, at the Chiang Kai-shek

      <P>Taipei police authorities said the more-than 10 kilograms of the
illicit drug, the largest amount ever found at any of Taiwan's
airports, had a street value of NT$28 million (US$800,000).</P>
      <P>A task force of Taipei City Police Headquarters led by Prosecutor
Hsu Ming-chu arrested five Taiwan women -- Huang Lee-ching, 25; Lee
Hsin-hsin, 21; Kao Tsu-ying, 21; Hung Yu-ting, 21; and Lin Chun-ping,
24 -- upon their arrival on flight SR 166 from Switzerland when they
were found to have the class 2 drugs strapped to their legs and
abdomens with bandages.</P>
      <P>The initial police investigation revealed that the five young
women -- none of whom has a criminal record -- left Taiwan Aug. 21
for Belgium to serve as couriers for a local drug dealer surnamed "Ah
Fu."</P>
      <P>The five women confessed that they agreed to carry the very pure
MDMA from Europe for "Ah Fu" for NT$100,000 each. Police suspected
that international drug lords might be responsible for the smuggling
plan.</P>
      <P>Police later also arrested a female drug dealer surnamed Hsu
within the airport who was seeking to contact the women. Hsu was
found to be the girlfriend of "Ah Fu," who remained at large.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KISSINGER SAYS MAINLAND CHINA COULD BECOME ENEMY OF UNITED STATES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  29  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger is convinced that Communist China could become America's
enemy, but "it should not happen as a result of our actions."</P>
      <P>In his view, the United States must defend itself against whoever
has missiles that would threaten America.</P>
      <P>In an exclusive interview published by NewsMax.com on its Web
site Wednesday, the 78-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner said, "I
don't think we have any one [enemy] anymore. We have a plethora of
issues before us. I think the emergence of China as a major country
is a challenge to America and to the international system.</P>
      <P>"It is a test for us: whether we can live in a world in which we
are the most powerful country, but in which we do not insist on
dominating. [Otherwise] we will use more and more of our resources
and expend our energy, as we have recently, by turning foreign policy
into a series of domestic issues. And we will lose our relevance,"
noted Kissinger.</P>
      <P>About who he would define as America's main enemy now, he said,
"It could happen that China becomes our enemy. But it is not
foreordained. And it should not happen as a result of our actions."</P>
      <P>Asked about the development of a U.S. "Star Wars"-type program
which he supports but Beijing finds extremely threatening, Kissinger
replied that, "I know it's an axiomatic view of the left around the
world that missile defense is sinful, and that it's desirable to keep
each nation as vulnerable as possible. But that's a debatable
premise. The U.S. must defend itself against whoever has missiles
that would threaten the United States. And you don't have to be able
to name an enemy."</P>
      <P>As to President George W. Bush's first few months on the foreign
affairs front, the former Secretary of State said, "He has been
amazingly sure-footed. And I agree with the main lines of his foreign
policy. Probably it would have been wiser to renegotiate the Kyoto
Protocol [adopted by the Clinton administration, agreeing to reduce
emissions of greenhouse gases, but rejected 95-0 by the Senate],
rather than abrogate it. But the main line of the foreign policy I
support."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRAFFIC SAFETY GETS BOOST WITH NEW 'BUCKLE UP, NO CELL PHONES' LAW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   30   (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Transportation and
Communications Yeh Chu-lan asked all drivers in Taiwan Thursday to
support the two new road-safety regulations to take effect Saturday
-- buckling up and leaving cell phones off while behind the wheel.</P>
      <P>Beginning Sept. 1, car drivers and front-seat passengers will be
required to wear seat belts and those driving motorcycles and cars
will be prohibited from using hand-held mobile phones while their
vehicles are in motion. Pillion passengers are not subject to the
restrictions.</P>
      <P>Under the two new regulations, approved by the government early
this year, car drivers and front-seat passengers will be fined
NT$1,500 if they are caught not wearing seat belts when the vehicle
is in motion. The fine applies to both individuals, but the ticket
will be written out to the driver of the vehicle.</P>
      <P>Automobile drivers will be fined NT$3,000 if they are caught
using hand-held cellular phones when driving, while motorcycle
drivers will face a fine of NT$1,000 if they are caught using
hand-held phones when riding, according to the new regulations.</P>
      <P>Yeh quoted tallies from Taipei's Wanfang General Hospital as
indicating that 47 percent of people who died in traffic accidents in
Taipei could have survived if they were wearing seat belts.</P>
      <P>In Japan, Yeh added, the death ratio of people who were not
wearing seat belts is seven times higher than that among people who
had buckled up.</P>
      <P>She also said that in the United States, statistics show that
lives of some 25,000 people were saved annually after vehicles were
equipped with seat belts, and some 125,000 others suffered lighter
injuries than would have been expected if they had not been wearing
seat belts.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the number of deaths from freeway traffic mishaps
declined by one-third from 1985 compared with 2000 when a new
road-safety regulation -- requiring car drivers to wear a seat belt
while driving on expressways or risk a fine of NT$1,500 -- was passed
by the Legislative Yuan and put into force, Yeh noted.</P>
      <P>Moreover, she said that it has been scientifically proven that
speaking on a hand-held mobile phone while driving can distract a
driver and can lead to an increased risk of traffic accidents.</P>
      <P>Traffic accidents cost Taiwan some NT$3 billion each year. The
losses include medical bills, decreased productivity and expenses
incurred during rehabilitation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OFFICIAL REAFFIRMS STANCE ON OPENING TO MAINLAND TOURISTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   30   (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior official reaffirmed the
government's commitment Thursday to opening the door to mainland
Chinese tourists, saying the policy will be substantiated in the
foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Chen Ming-tung made
the reaffirmation during a breakfast meeting with opposition People
First Party (PFP) legislators.</P>
      <P>At the meeting, many PFP lawmakers asked Chen how the government
will implement a consensus reached at the just-concluded Economic
Development Advisory Conference to allow mainland Chinese people to
visit Taiwan for sightseeing purposes.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen said the MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy
toward mainland China, already finalized planning work for the new
open-door policy in early July.</P>
      <P>"The policy has so far not been substantiated mainly because
certain critical issues have yet to be resolved," Chen said,
adding that time is needed for the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait discuss measures to prevent overstaying of mainland
Chinese tourists and upgrade quality of cross-strait travel
services.</P>
      <P>Since the Aug. 24-26 economic conference has reached a consensus
on opening Taiwan's door to mainland Chinese tourists, Chen said,
the government will put the policy into practice on an experimental
basis as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen refrained from giving a definite timetable for
implementing the measure. "It would be a disrespect to mainland China
if we unilaterally set a timetable at the moment," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Noting that mutual respect is crucial to cross-strait
interaction, Chen said the new open-door policy will be implemented
when cross-strait engagement proceeds smoothly.</P>
      <P>Although Beijing still refuses to resume the long-stalled
cross-strait dialogue, Chen said he is convinced that all hurdles
can be removed gradually and that mainland tourists will be able to
come to Taiwan in the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>Touching on the direct "three links" issue, chen said both sides
of the Taiwan Strait attach great importance to the topic related to
the opening of direct bilateral trade, mail and transportation
links.</P>
      <P>"As the 'three links' involve exercise of public authority,
the issue cannot be negotiated by unauthorized private
organizations," Chen said, adding that since Taiwan is a democratic
country ruled by law, the "three links" issue must be handled by the
government in accordance with existing law and regulations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER CHANG DESIGNATES SEPT. 21 NEW ARBOR DAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  30  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung on Thursday
designated Sept. 21 a new Arbor Day in Taiwan and called for the
public to contribute to the "one person, one tree" campaign to help
with re-forestation on the island.</P>
      <P>Chang urged everyone in Taiwan to support the "one person, one
tree" drive with a spirit of community by planting great numbers of
trees to enable residents on the island to "grasp firmly the land of
Taiwan with roots."</P>
      <P>The premier made the call when he took part in the 10th meeting
of the Cabinet-authorized 921 Earthquake Post-Disaster Recovery
Commission held at the headquarters of the now much-downsized Taiwan
Provincial Government located in Chunghsing New Village, central
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was hit by a devastating earthquake of magnitude 7.3 on
Sept. 21, 1999, the deadliest in four decades which claimed some
2,400 lives. Since then, Chang said, roads, bridges, tourism and
agricultural in the affected areas have clearly recovered from the
disaster.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan, particularly eastern and central parts, suffered
a new major blow when Typhoon Toraji wreaked havoc on the island in
late July, resulting in great losses in human lives and immeasurable
property damages, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>He said Sept. 21 (921) will be remembered as a watershed in
Taiwan's conservation rehabilitation and the day will be a new Arbor
Day on the island for re-forestation.</P>

      <P>The number of mainland students studying
in Macau will soar almost ninefold this academic year from 180 to
nearly 1,600, the South China Morning Post reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>It quoted Macau's education officials as saying that the rise is

that the exact number of mainland students enrolling at Macau's four

      <P>"We know so far that about 1,500 mainland students are planning
to study here in the next academic term," the official was quoted as

      <P>Hong Kong has 400 mainland students studying at the undergraduate

    <HEADLINE>CABINET CUTTING UNIFORM TAX REVENUE APPROPRIATION TO TAIPEI CITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  30  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung approved a
revision Thursday of the formula for the allocation of uniform tax
revenues which will result in a nearly NT$1.4 billion shortfall for
the Taipei City Government's fiscal 2002 revenues as compared with
the city government's projections based on the old formula.</P>
      <P>By changing the composition of reference factors of the formula,
the Cabinet is giving the Kaohsiung City Government a larger share of
the appropriations in fiscal 2002. The reference factors include
business revenues, population, area and financially sustaining
abilities.</P>
      <P>At a news conference Thursday, Minister without Portfolio Hu
Sheng-cheng said that in fiscal 2002, the Taipei City Government will
receive an appropriation of NT$47.9 billion, and the Kaohsiung City
Government NT$19.1 billion.</P>
      <P>Both Taipei and Kaohsiung cities have equal status within Taiwan
province. The two special municipalities take 43 percent of uniform
tax revenue appropriations, counties and provincial municipalities 39
percent, rural and urban townships 12 percent, and 6 percent goes for
special purposes.</P>
      <P>Considering that the Taipei City Government may have immediate
problems with less appropriations from tax revenues, the Cabinet will
create a special fund of NT$1 billion for the city government,
according to government spokesman Su Tzen-ping.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, frustrated and disappointed upon
learning of the Cabinet decision, said that the city government has
submitted its fiscal 2002 budget plan to the city council, and the
shortage will cause difficulties for the city government's budget
planning. He expects that the Cabinet will make up the difference of
NT$1.4 billion, he added.</P>
      <P>In Kaohsiung, Mayor Frank Hsieh said that an increase of NT$1.4
billion in its tax revenue appropriations from the central government
will help ease the port city's financial difficulties. The Cabinet's
decision signified an advancement of the central government in
promoting balanced development of the north (Taipei) and the south
(Kaohsiung).</P>
      <P>Refuting political opinions, the Kaohsiung mayor who is
concurrently chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party, said that
it was groundless to say that the Cabinet decision meant to embarrass
Mayor Ma, a member of the opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that Taipei City is far more advanced than other
cities in Taiwan in terms of basic infrastructure. He called upon the
Taipei City Government to be more generous in allowing a more
balanced development in different parts of the island.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung City Government said that the additional sum from
the central government will be mainly used to raise the payments to
various insurance programs, including public health, and those for
laborers, farmers, fishermen and the handicapped.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S CAL POISED TO BUY INTO MAINLAND CHINA AIR CARGO OPERATOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  30  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei-based China Airlines (CAL) is
planning to buy into mainland China's China Cargo as a shareholder of
the air cargo operator which is an affiliate of China Eastern Air
(China East) sources from Hong Kong reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>CAL is currently negotiating with China East for a 25 percent
stake in China Cargo's stocks to become a new partner of the air
cargo operator, according to Hong Kong's Wen Wei Po daily. CAL is
offering cash for the shares.</P>
      <P>Exactly how much CAL will spend for the shares of China Cargo
remains to be seen as the assets of China Cargo are still under
assessment, the report said.</P>
      <P>China East Chairman Yeh Yigan said his company is expected to
forge an agreement with CAL sometime in September for the buy-in, the
paper reported.</P>
      <P>CAL authorities were quoted by the daily newspaper as being "very
pleased to learn about the development."</P>
      <P>China Cargo, the first air cargo operator on the Chinese
mainland, is a joint venture between China East and China Ocean
Shipping (Group) Co., with the two holding 70 percent and 30 percent,
respectively, of the company's shares.</P>
      <P>With the joining of CAL, the three-way shareholding of China
Cargo will become 55 percent (China East), 20 percent (China Ocean
Shipping) and 25 percent (CAL), the daily said.</P>
      <P>The report indicated that CAL and China East personnel have been
in negotiations for years concerning the buy-in plan, but that talks
were suspended after Democratic Progressive Party's Chen Shui-bian
was elected the Republic of China president last year.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the talks resumed only in recent months, adding that the
CAL-China East cooperation is purely a business relationship and has
no "direct relations" with politics, according to the report.</P>
      <P>The report added that it is evident that both CAL and China East
are trying to secure their positions, paving the way for the opening
of direct travel and transportation links across the Taiwan Strait
which is expected in the near future.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Tai Kung Po daily (Hong Kong) also reported
Thursday about the CAL-China East tie-up.</P>
      <P>The paper quoted China East Chairman Yeh as saying that China
East is eyeing an imminent Taiwan-Hong Kong-Shanghai route for cargo
traffic in hopes that China Cargo will become a key carrier of
cargoes from Taiwan to Shanghai. From Shanghai, more cargoes
originating from Taiwan will be delivered to other major cities in
mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. DEPUTY DEFENSE SECRETARY RESTATES COMMITMENT TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  29  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Calling Taiwan "a model of both
economic and democratic reform," U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense
Paul Wolfowitz said that the United States remains committed to the
defense of the island and to the principle of peaceful resolution of
cross-strait differences.</P>
      <P>"We can more than adequately back up the commitments that are
enshrined in the Taiwan Relations Act and which the president
affirmed," Wolfowitz said in an interview published in Wednesday's
edition of the Washington Times.</P>
      <P>The United States is firmly committed to seeing the issue
resolved without force, he said. "So the Chinese would be making a
great mistake if they thought they could settle this thing on their
terms by using force," said the No. 2 Pentagon official.</P>
      <P>Wolfowitz reaffirmed the U.S. position after President George W.
Bush said in April that the United States would do "whatever it took"
to help Taiwan defend itself from an attack by mainland China under
the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>On the future of U.S relations with mainland China, he suggested
that the United States should be vigilant.</P>
      <P>"I don't think China has to be a threat," he said, "but I think
if we're complacent, then we could actually contribute to the
opposite effect."</P>
      <P>A former assistant Secretary of State for East Asia during the
Reagan era, Wolfowitz predicted that mainland China is "almost
certain to become a superpower in the next half-century, and maybe in
the next quarter-century."</P>
      <P>The question, he said, is whether the emerging superpower will
live at peace with its neighbors "or will it go the way of
traditional power diplomacy," which he said would be "a tragic
mistake for everybody" because of the weapons available today.</P>
      <P>Asked about the prospects of Beijing's leaders making political
reforms, Wolfowitz said, "Over the long run the Chinese political
system is going to have to change.</P>
      <P>"Does that mean it will quickly or overnight? Absolutely not," he
said. "And I don't particularly like being associated with theories
of economic inevitability because so many of them have been wrong in
the past."</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOCAL PILOTS PROTEST PLAN TO ALLOW HIRING OF FOREIGN CO-PILOTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Local civil aviation pilots voiced strong
opposition Thursday to a Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) plan to allow Taiwan carriers to hire foreign
nationals as co-pilots.</P>
      <P>Representatives from major civil aviation pilots associations
aired their views at a public hearing organized by opposition People
First Party (PFP) Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Liu said the MOTC has drafted revisions to the existing
regulations governing employment of foreign pilots by local carriers.
According to the amendment bill, local carriers will be allowed to
employ foreign nationals to serve as co-pilots.</P>
      <P>Liu further said the revised regulations do not require foreign
applicants to present certificates proving that they have experience
in operating the same types of aircraft they will fly for local
carriers.</P>
      <P>Liu said the MOTC plan to ease restrictions on employment of
foreign pilots does not comply with a consensus reached at the Aug.
24-26 Economic Development Advisory Conference that requires domestic
employers not to violate local workers' rights while recruiting
foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>Under the existing regulations, Taiwan carriers can only hire
foreign nationals as pilots.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Liu Li-chung, a flight instructor
with a local pilot's association, said that as of the end of June,
local carriers hired a total of 707 local pilots and 518 foreign
pilots.</P>
      <P>Liu Li-chung said foreign pilots do not necessarily outpace their
local counterparts in flight skills. He also claimed that the influx
of pilots from Third World countries in recent years has affected the
quality of flight safety .</P>
      <P>Moreover, he went on, some foreign pilots are unwilling to
cooperate in investigations of flight mishaps. He recalled that a
Mandarin Airlines plane committed a mishap at Hong Kong's Kai Tak
Airport two years ago. Its Italian pilot declined to accept Taiwan's
investigations and returned to Italy directly from Hong Kong. A
Canadian pilot also rejected a probe and returned to his home country
after he mistakenly flew a Taipei-bound plane to Taiwan's outlying
island of Penghu.</P>
      <P>As pilots from Third World countries usually settle for lower
salaries, Liu said he is worried that the MOTC's planned lifting of
the ban on hiring foreign co-pilots would affect their local
counterparts' job opportunities.</P>
      <P>He urged the MOTC to gradually reduce the ratio of foreign pilots
to protect local pilots' working rights. "The MOTC should also impose
stricter professional requirements on foreign pilots to ensure flight
safety," he added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kinmen, Aug. 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A mainland Chinese trade delegation, led by
Zheng Zungjie, head of the foreign trade department of the Fujian
provincial government, arrived in the Republic of China's frontline
island of Kinmen Thursday to attend a special trade fair.</P>
      <P>The 56-member group included senior Fujian officials in
charge of Taiwan affairs and trade affairs. Also among the members
was Kang Uni, deputy director of the Department of Taiwan, Hong Kong
and Macau Affairs under mainland China's Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation.</P>
      <P>Kang's presence indicated that mainalnd Chinese authorities
attach importance to the trade fair scheduled to open Friday, local
observers said.</P>
      <P>The trade fair will feature consumer products manufactured by 52
blue-chip firms in the Jinjiang area in Fujian province which lies
opposite Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 10-ton goods to be displayed in the Aug. 31-Sept. 2 trade
fair were shipped directly from Xiamen to Kinmen Monday. It was the
first batch of mainland consumer goods to be legally imported to
Kinmen since the ROC government opened direct trade, mail and
shipping links between its two offshore defense outposts of Kinmen
and Matsu and mainland China's Xiamen and Mawei ports in Fujian
province, commonly known as the "mini three links," at the beginning
of this year.</P>
      <P>In preparation for the trend-setting trade fair, a 112-member
mainland delegation, headed by Deputy Mayor of Jinjiang City Wang
Yuandong, already arrived in Kinmen Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Kinmen County Magistrate Chen Shui-tsai said he is very pleased
to see the arrivals of the two mainland trade delegations and the
opening of the trade fair.</P>
      <P>"The trade fair marks the start of a new stage in the
Kinmen-Xiamen commercial and civilian exchanges and is also expected
to turn a new page for the 'mini three links,'" Chen said, adding
that he also hopes the trade fair can set a new model for
cross-strait commercial exchanges.</P>
      <P>As Kinmen lies far closer to Fujian than to Taiwan, many mainland
products have been smuggled into Kinmen over the past years, despite
intensive coast guard patrols.</P>
      <P>Mainland products to be displayed in the show will include
footwear, furniture, toys, garments, consumer electronics and
construction materials and interior decorations.</P>
      <P>As mainland China has been reluctant to throw its full support
behind the Taiwan-initiated "mini three links," it still does not
allow regular direct Kinmen-Xiamen and Matsu-Mawei shipping services
and instead reviews such applications on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>Kinmen County Government sources said the forthcoming Jinjiang
trade fair may mark a change in mainland China's attitude toward the
"mini three links."</P>
      <P>"Anyway, we hope that the 'mini three links' can make headway
after the trade fair to help pave the way for opening of full-fledged
trade, communication and transportation links across the Taiwan
Strait," said Kinmen Magistrate Chen.</P>

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A 30-member delegation from the Hong Kong
Amity Association called on Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou Thursday to
exchange views on ways to strengthen relations and exchanges between
Taiwan and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>An advisor to the delegation, Xing Qeishan, who is director of
the Taiwan Affairs Department of the Beijing Liaison Office in Hong
Kong, traveled to Taiwan with the delegation but was not present at
the meeting.</P>
      <P>Several association members who are concurrently members of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) were among
the members of the delegation.</P>
      <P>Ma told his guests that relations between Taiwan and Hong Kong
are very close and added that although the Republic of China
government will relax the current "no haste, be patient" policy on
local investment in the mainland, open the local tourism market for
mainland visitors and negotiate with Beijing on postal, trade and
transport links after Beijing and Taiwan enter the World Trade
Organization (WTO), these moves will not affect Taiwan-Hong Kong
relations.</P>
      <P>He also said that Taipei officials are considering whether the
mainland city of Shanghai should be invited to take part in the Third
Taipei-Hong Kong City Forum to be sponsored by Taipei next year. If
Shanghai is unable to make preparations to attend in time, Ma said,
Shanghai should attend the forum as an observer so that it can
discuss issues related to culture, education and environmental
protection.</P>

      <P>Taiwan remained in fourth place in 2000 in
terms of patents approved in the U.S., behind the United States,
Japan and Germany, according to statistics released Thursday by the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>

      <P>DGBAS officials said Taiwan approved a total of 42,241 patent
rights in 2000, among which, 17,503, or 41.4 percent, were "creative"

      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan published 9,203 scientific papers in major
science periodicals in 2000, an increase of 259 from the number

    <HEADLINE>RUSSIA UNDER THREAT FROM MAINLAND TRADE INTEGRATION: ACADEMIC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  30  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Growing economic integration between
mainland China and Russia's Far East will pose a "real threat" to
Russia's territorial integrity, a Russian academic said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that bilateral mainland China-Russia ties are
good at present, Alexander Sharavin, a military expert and strategist
who has conducted in-depth studies on the matter, said territorial
disputes between the two countries remain unresolved.</P>
      <P>Sharavin made the remarks while giving a keynote speech titled
"Mainland-Russia Relations in the New Era" on the closing day of the
Third Asia-Pacific Security Forum, which was sponsored by the
National Policy Institute and the Washington-based Center for
Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).</P>
      <P>Scores of experts and think-tank members from Taiwan, the United
States, France, Germany, Japan, Australia, Russia, Singapore, India
and India took part in the gathering for talks on Asia-Pacific
security and exchanges.</P>
      <P>According to Sharavin, mainland China has been carrying out
creeping expansion in Russia over the past decade. Although Russia
has firmly upheld the "one China" policy which regards Taiwan as part
of mainland China, he said that the mainland has not yet abandoned
its territorial claims toward Russia.</P>
      <P>In Russia's Far East and Siberia, the number of mainland Chinese
migrants (mostly illegal immigrants) outnumbers the local
populations, he noted, adding that the economic dependence of those
Russian regions on mainland China in recent years has led to deeper
integration between those regions and the mainland. "That is a big
threat to Russia's territorial integrity," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>The two-day seminar held in Taipei formed part of a series of
activities initiated by the CSIS and the France-based IFRI in 1997
with an aim of promoting strategic exchanges and security talks in
the Asia-Pacific region. Four large-scale international conferences
or roundtable forums have been held since then.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OVERSEAS CHINESE PROMOTE ROC'S U.N. BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New   York,   Aug.   29   (CNA)
(By Eric Tseng and Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Overseas Chinese leaders and
representatives from the Republic of China's major political parties
issued a declaration Wednesday in New York in support of the ROC's
entry into the United Nations.</P>
      <P>As the ROC is about to launch its ninth consecutive bid to rejoin
the U.N., which will convene its General Assembly Sept. 11, the
Chinese communities in New York and representatives from Taiwan's
ruling Democratic Progressive Party, opposition Kuomintang and People
First Party urged the international community to respect Taiwan
people's rights and accept the ROC as a U.N. member.</P>
      <P>They said at a press conference that although they embrace
different political ideals, their support and love for Taiwan are the
same and they feel deep regret over the unfair treatment that ROC has
received from the world community for decades.</P>
      <P>The declaration emphasizes that the U.N. has changed its way of
thinking since the end of the Cold War and now pays more attention to
issues concerning human survival and development, such as disease,
environmental protection, human rights, trade, women and children,
and housing.</P>
      <P>Because Taiwan's 23 million people are excluded from the U.N.,
they are deprived of their basic rights and cannot participate in
discussions organized by the U.N. Consequently, they cannot share in
the results of such discussions, the declaration says, adding that
this situation violates completely the basic principle and spirit of
the U.N. Chapter, and goes against the world trend.</P>
      <P>The declaration continues that the disputes between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait should be resolved through negotiations. Until
that time, it goes on, no one can represent Taiwan's people except
the democratically elected ROC government.</P>
      <P>The fact that mainland China claims in the world community that
it can represent Taiwan is far from reality, the declaration
continues. "Beijing has no right to represent Taiwan's 23 million
people," it says.</P>
      <P>The declaration also urges the Beijing authorities to face the
reality of the existence of the ROC and urges the international
community to respect Taiwan people's basic rights.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KAOHSIUNG CITY HOUSES MOST OBESE PEOPLE IN TAIWAN: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  30  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung City leads the island's 19
counties and cities in terms of the number of overweight people
living there, according to the results of a survey released Thursday
by a local publication.</P>
      <P>Offshore Penghu County and eastern Taitung County came in second
and third places in the survey by Health monthly.</P>
      <P>An alarming discovery of the survey is that most of people in the
three areas have no idea that they are overweight, said the magazine.</P>
      <P>The survey was based on telephone interviews with 3,520 people
across the island. The respondents gave their weight and height and
the interviewers calculated their body mass index (BMI) with
computers.</P>
      <P>BMI is an easy way of measuring a person's health. It is
calculated by dividing one's weight in kilograms by the square of
one's height in meters.</P>
      <P>A BMI of 19 to 24.9 is considered healthy. A BMI of 25 to 29.9 is
considered overweight, 30 to 39.9 is obese, and 40 or more is very
obese. A BMI of less than 19.0 is deemed unhealthy and may indicate
malnourishment.</P>
      <P>Keelung City is the most healthy city. according to the survey
results, with 60 percent of its residents having a healthy BMI. Only
32 percent of them are overweight or obese.</P>
      <P>Following behind are Taipei County, Hsinchu City, Taichung City
and Kaohsiung County, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>In contrast, people in Kaohsiung City, Penghu County, Taitung
County, Pingtung County and Chiayi County registered the lowest rate
of healthy BMI, ranging from 42 percent to 45 percent.</P>
      <P>Since low vigilance against obesity is believed to be a
contributory factor, it is not surprising that Penghu County has the
highest rate -- 22 percent -- of people who said they are not alert
to obesity, followed by those in Chiayi County, Pingtung County,
Taitung County, Tainan County and Hualien County. More than 10
percent of the respondents in the four counties said they do not
consider themselves overweight.</P>
      <P>However, people in Hsinchu City, Taipei County, Hsinchu County,
Taipei City and Taichung City "usually consider themselves
overweight."</P>
      <P>Lee Se, the editor-in-chief of the magazine, told a news
conference called to release the survey results that obesity, which
involves many health risks, is a worldwide problem.</P>
      <P>The lack of a mass transportation system has bearing on people's
weight, he went on, since it encourages people to resort to personal
transportation vehicles such as cars and motorcycles and therefore
increases the health risks caused by air pollution, traffic
accidents.</P>
      <P>The cities and counties which have the most obese residents in
the survey are also those with less efficient mass transportation
systems and those with higher numbers of personal vehicles, said Lee.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VISA-FREE TREATMENT URGED FOR VISITORS FROM NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  30  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government should
consider granting visa-free treatment to visitors from neighboring
countries such as South Korea in line with its plan to open its doors
to mainland Chinese tourists, a local industry leader said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Stanley C. Yen, chairman of the Taiwan Tourism Association, told
CNA in an exclusive interview that the government should consider
making the move step-by-step, as it will take some time for the "open
door" policy to mainland Chinese tourists to be implemented.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by the Tourism Bureau under the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications, Yen said the number of
tourists from Japan, Hong Kong and Macao account for more than half
of the 2.5 million tourist arrivals to Taiwan per year and that
recent tallies show that Japanese tourist arrivals have rebounded to
the previous levels posted before the Sept. 21 earthquake of 1999.</P>
      <P>Since the government has also recently begun offering
landing-visa privileges to visitors from Hong Kong and Macao, Yen
contended that visa regulations should be further eased and more
fully opened in order to attract more tourists.</P>
      <P>As to the long-awaited two-way tourist exchanges across the
Taiwan Strait, the noted hotelier said that politics should not
interfere in the matter and called on the government to promote
mutually beneficial measures to help boost Taiwan's economy as long
as the nation's security is maintained. "Overemphasis on ideology
will only complicate the issue," he stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT JUGGLES PRESS FREEDOM WITH NATIONAL SECURITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  30  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bien warned Thursday
that press freedom is not a pretext for obliterating the division
between "the enemy and ourselves."</P>
      <P>In a meeting with local journalists on the Presidential Office
beat, the president said that as head of state, he has an obligation
to protect press freedom, but this freedom should not take precedence
over national security, because no freedom could be guaranteed if the
country were to cease to exist.</P>
      <P>As a pro-democracy activist in his earlier career, Chen said, he
himself was the publisher of a political magazine and was jailed for
articles carried by the magazine, and therefore he understands
journalistic convictions and principles.</P>
      <P>But as president, he went on, he has to defend both the security
of the state and the freedom of the press, which itself is dependent
on national security.</P>
      <P>He urged the journalists to keep the idea of national security in
the backs of their minds, especially in the face of the Beijing
regime. "We should remain alert to disasters, risks and Beijing's
hostility," he said.</P>
      <P>Cautioning that national security is no laughing matter, the
president said reporters who poke fun at national security might not
mean any harm, but their readers might not be able to realize the
humor in the stories and misunderstand their meaning.</P>
      <P>He noted bitterly that from reading their stories, he can hardly
tell if some of Taiwan's journalists are reporters from the Republic
of China or from the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>He urged the reporters to "brush up on their loyalty to the
country," to keep in mind the interests of the 23 million people on
the island and heighten their guard against "the enemy."</P>
      <P>Throwing all this to the wind under the pretext of press freedom
would be an inappropriate judgment for a journalist, according to
Chen.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks after being asked about criminal
cases against government officials who have recently been accused of
passing out "secrets" to newspapers.</P>
      <P>At least one military officer and one government official have
been convicted and sentenced to jail terms to date, with two more
cases pending in the judicial system.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
urged the nation's armed forces Thursday to further strengthen its
training and combat readiness in order to fully safeguard the
country.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the ROC troops must be an army capable of
protecting the nation and its people from any outside attack, Chen
said the ROC's military buildup is being carried out to secure the
country's continued development and ensure the safety and well-being
of its people, and is by no means an arms race with other countries
or a move to provoke tension.</P>
      <P>As the situation surrounding Taiwan's offshore islands has
changed markedly since Taiwan's implementation of the "mini three
links" with certain ports in mainland China's Fujian Province at the
beginning of this year, he appealed to all ROC troops to heighten
their alert in order to prevent sudden attack or infiltration from
the mainland.</P>
      <P>Only a capable military force with a strong determination will be
able to help the nation deter threats from other countries and avoid
war, especially at a time when mainland Chinese troops are conducting
amphibious military exercises on Dongshan Island designed to simulate
an attack on ROC-held Penghu Island, he said.</P>
      <P>As current world trends do not allow Taiwan and mainland China to
devote their energy and limited sources to a mutual standoff, Chen
urged the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to engage in mutually
beneficial trade and cultural exchanges and cooperation with mutual
trust in order to forge a "win-win" situation as a foundation toward
achieving eternal peace.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks during an inspection tour of
troops stationed on the offshore Penghu Island. He was accompanied by
Minister of National Defense Wu Shih-wen and Chief of the General
Staff Tang Yao-ming.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing that the armed forces are an indispensable element
for a country's persistent survival, Chen thanked all ranking
military officers and their troops for their remarkable contributions
to Taiwan's safety and prosperity.</P>
      <P>During a dinner party later the same day in Taipei with ranking
military chiefs, the president wished all the military servicemen a
happy "Armed Forces Day," which falls Sept. 3, and promised to
continue with the military modernization program.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NTU STUDENTS OPPOSE SEX OFFENDER'S UNCONDITIONAL RELEASE ON PAROLE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  30  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A National Taiwan University student
organization has launched a petition drive on campus to oppose a sex
offender's unconditional release on parole lest he should become an
NTU freshman.</P>
      <P>The sex offender, who committed more than 30 sex assaults, was
permitted to attend national joint college entrance examinations,
which he passed, qualifying him to attend NTU this summer.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice was to hold a special meeting Friday to
decide whether to release him on parole to enable him to enter the
campus.</P>
      <P>Besides launching the petition drive, the Alliance for the
Self-Defense of Student Security also urged the university
administration to compile and distribute handbooks on campus security
to students and to boost campus security in a bid to provide students
with a safe study environment.</P>
      <P>An NTU Social Science Department student said the department is
now busy sponsoring a series of activities to welcome freshmen and
the issue of whether the offender will enter the department has
naturally become a focus of concern.</P>
      <P>The student said that students' parents have expressed hope that
the university will deal with the issue carefully.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S ELECTRONIC INDUSTRY OUTPUT WILL DECLINE IN 2001: CEPD</HEADLINE>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The output of Taiwan's electronic industry
will decline in value this year, according to a report commissioned
by the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>The report forecast that dynamic random access memory (DRAM)
manufacturers will suffer losses of NT$30 billion (US$882.35 million)
as a whole, while thin-film transistor liquid crystal display
(TFT-LCD) manufacturers will suffer losses of NT$16 billion
(US$470.58 million), with small- and medium-sized firms bearing the
brunt.</P>
      <P>Citing the slim world growth of 2.4 percent for this year and the
negative expansion for the United States in the second quarter, the
report predicted a worldwide decline of 53 percent, the second
biggest plunge in history, in DRAM sales.</P>
      <P>The report estimated that the world's semiconductor market will
shrink by 35 percent this year, before expanding by 12 percent next
year and 23 percent in 2003.</P>
      <P>As for Taiwan, the wafer foundry market will be cut by 32 percent
this year, with the capacity factor -- the percentage of utilized
capacity to installed capacity -- declining from 97 percent last year
to 54 percent this year, translating into a loss of NT$30 billion.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and mainland China's bids to
join the World Trade Organization (WTO) are on track to be approved
in November when the world trade regulatory body holds a
ministerial-level meeting in Qatar, sources from the U.S. Trade
Representative (USTR) office said Thursday.</P>
      <P>U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick said that as the
current process is moving along in a very constructive way, there
certainly is a real prospect of this happening at the Nov. 9-13 WTO
meeting in Doha, Qatar.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has reached bilateral agreements on WTO accession
with 37 members countries, and the process for it to join the global
trading club will soon be concluded, Zoellick said, adding that
Taiwan is expected to join at about the same time.</P>
      <P>However, Zoellick, answering a CNA reporter's questions during a
news briefing, declined to further clarify whether the accessions of
mainland China and Taiwan will occur back-to-back or one day apart.</P>
      <P>According to USTR officials, even if WTO admission for both
Taiwan and mainland China is approved in November, actual accession
is not expected to happen until January, 2002, as the legislatures of
Taiwan and mainland China will first have to formally consent to the
conditions attached to admission.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAPAN FIRMLY OPPOSES TO FORCE TO SETTLE TAIWAN ISSUE: LEGISLATOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  31  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Japanese government has repeatedly
conveyed messages to mainland Chinese authorities that Japan firmly
opposes Beijing using force against Taiwan to settle the so-called
"Taiwan issue," an influential Japanese parliamentarian said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Koichi Kato, Japan's former chief Cabinet secretary, who is
currently visiting Taipei at the invitation of the private politics
think-tank Nanhai Foundation, said leaders on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait should "sit down and talk" to narrow down their
differences, rather than resort to military confrontation.</P>
      <P>In a speech delivered Thursday, Kato said that Japan forged
diplomatic relations with mainland China in 1972 based on Japan's
national policies and that since then, Japan has clearly stated its
position regarding Beijing-Taipei-Tokyo triangular relations.</P>
      <P>He added that the current Japan-China diplomatic framework is in
line with Japan's interests and is conducive to stability in the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Kato pointed out, however, that the international community
should spare no efforts in helping bolster cross-Taiwan Strait
stability.</P>
      <P>At the same time, he said, both sides of the Taiwan Strait should
return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and work toward
reconciliation, adding that whichever side causes cross-strait
relations to deteriorate will fail to obtain approval from members of
the international community.</P>
      <P>Kato, a member of the lower house of the Japanese Diet who has
for a long time been known as pro-Beijing, stressed that regional
economic prosperity closely hinges on stability in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He warned that based on the experience of history, any regional
conflict that remains stalemated for a prolonged period of time
creates a powder-keg situation that can easily lead to bloodshed.</P>
      <P>He said he keenly expects that conflict will never break out
across the Taiwan Strait, calling on both sides to sit down and
engage in talks on political, economic and diplomatic issues and
never resort to force to solve disputes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DIRECT LINKS TALKS MUST BE CONDUCTED BY AUTHORIZED OFFICIAL REPS: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  31  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Engagements between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait that involve the exercise of public authority should be
negotiated by government agencies or officially authorized
organizations, a senior official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Lin Chong-pin made the
remarks in response to a mainland Chinese official's recent statement
that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can negotiate direct "three
links" issues through private organizations.</P>
      <P>Wang Zaixi, deputy director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under
mainland China's State Council or Cabinet, said in a speech delivered
in Singapore Thursday that so long as Taiwan regards the direct
cross-strait "three links" as a domestic matter, technical details
regarding the opening of such links could be negotiated through civic
groups, private corporations, or industry and trade associations.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Wang's overture, Lin said government-to-government
talks are needed for any cross-strait engagements that involve the
exercise of public authority.</P>
      <P>"This is our established policy and position," Lin said, adding
that as the opening of direct trade, postal and transportation links,
commonly known as the "three links," involves many critical issues,
relevant government agencies or officially authorized intermediary
bodies on both sides must sit down to talk to lay down certain basic
rules and operational guidelines.</P>
      <P>As the just-concluded Economic Development Advisory Conference
reached a consensus on easing restrictions on cross-strait trade and
investment, the timing for opening the direct "three links" has
become a hot topic on both sides of the Taiwan Strait in recent days.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taichung  City, Aug. 31 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Cabinet official said Friday that
it is still too early to react to speculation on whether Taichung
Harbor in central Taiwan will be authorized as one of the Taiwan
seaports to engage in direct shipping with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-tong, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), Taiwan's highest government agency in charge
of formulating policies toward mainland China, called on the Taiwan
public not to engage in meaningless speculation, saying that the
questions of which seaports and how many will be designated as
appointed ports for direct cross-strait shipping is still in the
planning stage.</P>
      <P>Chen said he is bewildered by rumors that Taichung Harbor has
been excluded from the list, which have stirred up swipes against the
government from among the people in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As for the official opening of Taiwan to mainland Chinese
tourists, Chen said the MAC will announce the implementation date "at
the appropriate time."</P>
      <P>He made the remarks during a forum held at Feng Chia University

Chia-cheng, chairman of the Cabinet-level Research, Development and

University.</P>
      <P>Chen said he clearly understands that people from central Taiwan,
particularly those in the tourism sector, have attached great
expectations on the opening of Taiwan to mainland Chinese tourists
for leisure trips as this is expected to be an important shot in
the arm for central Taiwan, whose tourism industry has been sluggish
since the devastating 921 earthquake in 1999.</P>
      <P>He added that although the Cabinet has given the green light to
the plan in July regarding the opening of Taiwan to mainland Chinese
tourists, the exact time it will formally take effect has not yet
been decided as bilateral negotiations on technical issues remain
unsettled.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ENGLISH BECOMES COMPULSORY COURSE IN TAIWAN'S ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  31  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Schoolchildren in Taiwan are to start
learning English at the fifth grade in elementary school as part of
the education authorities' push for an "the earlier, the better"
policy in English teaching.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Education has instructed all elementary schools
to include English in the curricula of the fifth and sixth grades in
the semester beginning early September.</P>
      <P>As foreign language ability becomes more and more important in
academic as well as career pursuits in Taiwan, the education
authorities have sought to create a better environment for the
younger generation to master English, which is the most popular
foreign language in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the past few years, several elementary schools, mostly private
ones, have started to give English lessons to their pupils. English
courses have become attractions of these schools and many parents try
very hard to have their children registered at these schools.</P>
      <P>It is not unusual to find urban children starting to learn
English at kindergarten or bilingual cram schools as early as four
years of age. Before the educational authorities announced that
English would be a compulsory course in elementary school curricula,
children's English-learning cram schools and bilingual kindergartens
were already mushrooming in metropolitan Taipei and other big cities
on the island.</P>
      <P>Many children in urban areas have already learned English basics
before starting courses in elementary school, according to an
educational official. With better resources, children in the cities
usually have a head-start, he added.</P>
      <P>While the Ministry of Education is expecting that compulsory
English will provide all children with equal opportunities in school,
the first syndrome of the urban-rural difference is already apparent,
as many elementary schools in remote areas are already having
difficulty recruiting qualified English teachers.</P>
      <P>With the new semester beginning within the next few days, schools
in Hualien and Taitung counties on the eastern coast, southern
Pingtung County, and the offshore islands of Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu
are still waiting for applicants for posts as English teachers, the
official said.</P>
      <P>He added that at least 600 more English teachers are needed by
the 2,557 registered elementary schools.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND-BASED TAIWAN BUSINESSMEN FAVOR EASED TRADE POLICIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  31  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Shanghai-based businessman from Taiwan
said recently that phasing out the government's "no haste, be
patient" policy restricting local investment in mainland China will
help bolster competitiveness on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The businessman claimed that in any case, the policy is only
symbolic rather than an effective means of holding back Taiwan trade
with and investment in mainland China, adding that Taiwan investment
in the mainland has never stopped, despite government regulations.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Taiwan Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers
Association claimed meanwhile that Taiwan has "no choice" but to opt
for relaxed restrictions on trade with the mainland, particularly in
the face of mainland China's World Trade Organization (TWO) entry,
when major manufacturers and traders from the United States, Japan
and South Korea are expected to jump into the huge mainland market to
take advantage of the freer trade environment after China's WTO
accession.</P>
      <P>Another Taiwan businessman, based in Guangzhou, said relaxed
trade regulations toward the mainland will benefit both sides of the
Taiwan Strait, which can jointly explore mainland and world markets
using Taiwan's technology, management and expertise in international
trade and mainland China's cheap workforce and immense market
potential.</P>
      <P>Yet another Shanghai-based Taiwan businessman lauded Taiwan's
recent decision to phase out the "no haste, be patient" policy,
saying that replacing policies of containment with measures based on
"positive opening and efficient control" will eventually benefit
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan will become richer and stronger after Taiwan
businesses harvest gains from mainland China's rising economy, in
which Taiwan capital and manpower are helping a lot.</P>
      <P>Hsu Ming-yi, a researcher from the National Policy Research
Foundation in Taiwan, said that in accordance with the theory of
international investment, the more investment a company makes abroad,
the more returns the company will secure from its overseas
operations, underlining the current situation of Taiwan investment in
mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRODUCTION FACILITIES OF TAIWAN'S IC FOUNDRIES LYING IDLE: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  31  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The production utility rate of Taiwan's
semiconductor foundries this year is estimated at only 54 percent of
their manufacturing capability, as compared with 97 percent last
year, according to a report by the Council for Economic Planning and
Development.</P>
      <P>The report, released Friday, says that production value of
Taiwan's electronic industry as a whole is expected to drop
considerably this year.</P>
      <P>The DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) sector will suffer the
most, with the yearly loss amounting to NT$30 billion, while the
TFT-LCD sector is estimated to lose NT$16 billion.</P>
      <P>As prospects for the semiconductor sector worldwide remain
sluggish, the report forecast that the market for Taiwan
semiconductor manufacturers this year will shrink by 35 percent from
the level of the previous year.</P>
      <P>The two leading semiconductor manufacturers in Taiwan -- Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (TSMC) and United Microelectronics
Corp. (UMC) -- both suffered sales declines in the first half of this
year.</P>
      <P>In July, TSMC managed to achieve a 1 percent sales growth over
last month, thanks to the gradual sales recovery of components for
PCs and IA products. UMC, on the other hand, continued to suffer a
sales drop due to heavy inventories of telecommunications products.</P>
      <P>The report says that the downstream packing and testing factories
are suffering greatly as a consequence, with most of their production
facilities lying idle.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC SHOULD HAVE PLACE IN ASIA-PACIFIC SECURITY COOPERATION: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  31 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that
the Republic of China should not be excluded from an Asia-Pacific
security cooperation mechanism.</P>
      <P>Chen said Asia-Pacific military cooperation should not be
confined to the United States and Japan, but should include other
Asian countries.</P>
      <P>"Even though Taiwan does not maintain formal diplomatic ties with
the United States or Japan, it should not be shut out of a regional
defense cooperation agreement," he said.</P>
      <P>The president further said that peace in the Taiwan Strait is the
basis of Asia-Pacific security and is in the common interests of
European Union nations with interests in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with participants in the 2001
Taipei Roundtable of the Asia-Pacific Security Forum, jointly
organized by Taipei's Institute for National Policy Research, the
Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies
(CSIS), the Institute for Strategic and Development Studies (ISDS) in
the Philippines and the French Institute Francais des Relations
Internationales (IFRI).</P>
      <P>He told his guests that he has consistently adopted a positive
and supportive attitude toward any mechanism that would contribute to
Taiwan Strait peace and Asia-Pacific security.</P>
      <P>Chen went on that since he assumed office in the ROC's first
democratic transfer of power between different political parties in
May 2000, he has on many occasions reiterated his desire to resume
cross-strait dialogue and normalize cross-strait relations for the
well-being of the people on both sides.</P>
      <P>"Moreover, we have outlined our basic principles for handling
cross-strait affairs -- goodwill reconciliation, active cooperation
and permanent peace," Chen continued.</P>
      <P>As for the controversial "one China" issue, Chen said he has
repeatedly suggested that the top leaders on both sides use their
wisdom to find a mutually acceptable definition of "one China" under
the principles of "democracy, parity and peace."</P>
      <P>Chen said he firmly believes that normalization of trade and
economic ties will be the first step toward normalizing cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>In his previous major policy speeches, Chen went on, he has
advocated cross-strait economic and cultural integration as a basis
for forging a new framework to maintain permanent peace in the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Touching on the just-concluded Economic Development Advisory
Conference (EDAC), the president said the meeting marked the first
time since the inauguration of his administration that the ruling and
opposition parties have sat down to discuss major national issues.</P>
      <P>"It was no easy task for the 120 EDAC members to forge consensus
on a number of public issues, including the sensitive cross-strait
relations," Chen said, adding that one consensus reached at the Aug.
24-26 meeting was that the "no haste, be patient" policy on
cross-strait investment will be replaced by a policy based on "active
opening, effective management."</P>
      <P>He also said he agrees with a conclusion reached at the 2001
Taipei Roundtable that Taiwan politicians should refrain from "taking
domestic partisan disputes" to Beijing.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, CSIS Pacific Forum Director Ralph Cossa told
Chen that mainland Chinese officials and scholars told him and
several other CSIS researchers during a recent visit to Beijing that
some Taiwan opposition politicians had advised mainland authorities
not to forge contacts with the Chen administration.</P>
      <P>The unidentified Taiwan opposition politicians were quoted as
having told Beijing officials that if Beijing resumes cross-strait
dialogue during Chen's tenure, Chen would stand a better chance of
winning re-election three years hence. Chen was Beijing's least-liked
candidate in Taiwan's 2000 presidential election due to his party's
pro-independence stance.</P>
      <P>Cossa said he was not sure whether any Taiwan politician had
really offered such advice to Beijing. "I just want to remind Taiwan
politicians that Beijing officials and scholars have made such a
claim," he added.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chen said he hopes that local politicians can
refrain from trying to block Beijing from developing contacts with
his administration. "Such action would not only allow Beijing to get
involved in Taiwan's domestic political disputes but it also violates
the democratic spirit and rational inter-party competition," he
stressed.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An executive of the Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC) -- Taiwan's top chip maker -- said
Friday that his company is preparing to send officials to mainland
China to study the feasibility of setting up strongholds there.</P>
      <P>From the viewpoint of a global management strategy, mainland
China is a market TSMC cannot afford to lose because of its market
potential, and the company is planning to dispatch officials to
collect information regarding trade and investment opportunities in
major mainland Chinese cities, according to TSMC Chief Executive
Officer F.C. Tseng.</P>
      <P>Tseng said that TSMC has not yet decided whether it should set up
offices in Beijing, Shanghai or Shenzhen, despite the fact that the
company already has mainland Chinese clients. He reiterated that TSMC
will not cast any investment into the mainland in the near future.</P>
      <P>Tseng's remarks echoed those of TSMC Chairman Morris Chang, who
said at the recent Economic Development Advisory Conference that the
time has come for his company to make a move in order to edge into
the mainland Chinese market.</P>
