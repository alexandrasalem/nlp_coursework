    <TEXT>The Straits Times: SIA pilots: Law to be
tightened.

The Singapore Government yesterday hardened its stand on
Singapore Airlines (SIA) pilots, saying it will tighten the
law to remove union members' right to have the final say in
any negotiations with management.

The Lianhe Zaobao: To prevent another confrontation between
SIA and Alpa-S, Singapre Govt will amend the law.

To prevent another a cycle of acrimony, Ministry of Manpower
will amend the Trade Unions Act to ensure that the rules of
registered trade unions enable executive committees to
negotiate and commit to collective agreements without the need
for formal ratification by the general membership or the
branches.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT TO AMEND TRADE UNIONS ACT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec.  1 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After several warnings by government
ministers to the Singapore Airlines (SIA) pilots' union, the
Singaporean government has taken the first step to what it says is
"preventing another cycle of acrimony between management and the
pilots' union."</P>
      <P>The government announced Monday in a statement that it will
amend the Trade Unions Act, a process which is likely to take several
months.</P>
      <P>The recent ouster of the leadership of the Airline Pilots
Association of Singapore (ALPA-S) led three government ministers to
warn the pilots not to embark on "confrontational industrial
relations" or "take on the government."</P>
      <P>The amendment will allow executive committees of trade unions to
negotiate and commit to collective agreements without having to go
back to its members for approval.</P>
      <P>The ALPA-S is the only trade union in Singapore where members
have to approve agreements struck by its executive committee.</P>
      <P>The government noted that the ALPA-S and the SIA management have
had a troubled relationship, with protracted negotiations often
resulting in deadlock. Between 1980 and this year, 25 disputes
between the two sides had to go before the Ministry of Manpower (MOM)
for conciliation.</P>
      <P>This year, SIA management negotiated with the pilots' union as
SARS hit the travel industry. The MOM and the Industrial Arbitration
Court had to be called in to help settle the wage-cut package.
However, after an agreement was reached, 55 percent of the ALPA-S
members voted out the negotiating team.</P>
      <P>The government emphasized that both SIA management and the pilots
must put the past behind them and start anew. It said SIA must
improve its human resource management so that the emphasis is not
entirely on the pilots and management has to pay competitive wages
and incentives to staff.</P>
      <P>The government statement stressed that aviation is a key
industry, pointing out that SARS, terrorism, low-cost airlines and
other developments challenge Singapore's status as a premier air hub.</P>
      <P>It added that confrontational industrial relations will add to
the problems of SIA and so put jobs at risk.</P>
      <P>The statement ended by saying that the government will not allow
any group to undermine good industrial relations based on the
partnership between unions, management and the government.</P>
      <P>A member of the ALPA-S executive committee said he is surprised
the government has resorted to amending the Trade Unions Act. Captain
P. James, vice president of industrial relations, said ALPA-S members
will be unhappy with the move because it will remove one of their
rights.</P>
      <P>James said he disagrees that the pilots' union has been
confrontational by sacking its leadership. pointing out that it was
just an internal constitutional process which was followed and
initiated to change the leadership.</P>
      <P>He said SIA should treat its employees as partners in this
process, and not just as something with a price tag that can be
replaced.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER REFUSES TO RULE OUT OPTION FOR VOIDING REFERENDUM BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has not yet decided
whether to ask the Legislative Yuan to reconsider a referendum bill
that the Executive Yuan considers "flawed", Premier Yu Shyi-kun said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Although President Chen Shui-bian said he will call a referendum
March 20 whatever the outcome of the present controversy, it will not
stop the Executive Yuan from turning the bill back over to the
Legislative Yuan, as that is another issue altogether, Yu went on.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan will not show its hand before being given
formal notice by the Legislative Yuan of the passage of the bill.</P>
      <P>In a related development that day, an appeal for a ruling by the
Council of Grand Justices on the "unconstitutionality" of the bill
has already won the endorsement of 81 lawmakers from the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), far more than the number required
for such an appeal.</P>
      <P>Condemning the opposition of Kuomintang (KMT) and People First
Party (PFP) for steam-rolling through the legislature a bill rife
with flaws, the ruling party lawmakers are trying to annul the bill
through a Council of Grand Justice ruling, which is empowered to
strike down "unconstitutional" laws.</P>
      <P>Instead of giving people a full right of referendum, they said,
the bill restricts the public's right to initiate amendments to
Constitution, while giving this right over to the legislature.</P>
      <P>However, the appeal was not presented to the council immediately
because the bill has not yet been promulgated by the president.</P>
      <P>The KMT and PFP lawmakers, boosted by their victory in pushing
through the bill, moved on to seek sponsors among their colleagues in
the legislature for a proposal to revise the Constitution with the
dual aims of writing the newly created referendum legislation into
the Constitution and cutting by half the number of legislators.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) approved Monday an amendment to the
national development program for next year, adjusting the annual
growth rate from the original planned 4.7 percent to 5 percent.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials said that the execution of the government's
proposed expansion of public construction projects by NT$500 billion
(US$14.7 billion) in the next five years and the continuous
implementation of programs for increasing jobs, which have been in
effect since earlier this year, are required to achieve the goal.</P>
      <P>The speed of world's economic recovery will also serve as a key
factor for Taiwan's economic performance, they noted.</P>
      <P>The country's top economic planning agency estimated that
consumption and investment by the private sector will increase by 3.5
percent and 9.6 percent next year, respectively.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, public sector consumption, investment and investment
from state-run enterprises will grow by 2.4 percent, 16 percent and
0.3 percent, respectively, they added.</P>
      <P>At the same time, they predicted, exports and imports of
commodities and services will surge by 6.7 percent and 7.6 percent,
respectively.</P>
      <P>In terms of production, they forecast that the output of the
knowledge-intensive manufacturing and service industries will enjoy
growth of 8.8 percent and 8.7 percent, respectively, while the
non-knowledge-intensive manufacturing industry will grow 2.8 percent.</P>
      <P>The CEPD also estimated that the unemployment rate will fall to
4.5 percent by the end of next year, while the consumer price index
will rise by 0.7 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CAL PLANE AIRLIFTS ROCSAT-2 TO U.S. FOR JANUARY LAUNCH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's second satellite --
ROCSAT-2 -- left Taiwan Monday for the United States where it will be
launched into orbit early next year.</P>
      <P>The 3,000 kg satellite is scheduled to arrive by air in Los
Angeles Tuesday, according to the National Space Program Office
(NSPO).</P>
      <P>"The satellite will then be delivered by truck to Vandenberg
Air Force Base in California for liftoff Jan. 17," said Chen
Jeng-shing, the ROCSAT-2 project manager.</P>
      <P>The satellite was placed in a special container into which
nitrogen was injected to ensure stable conditions for the long
journey to the United States, Chen said.</P>
      <P>China Airlines, Taiwan's largest carrier experienced in
transporting precision machinery, airlifted ROCSAT-2 to Los Angeles.
Two French engineers from the NSPO's French contractor Astrium Co.,
along with an NSPO engineer, accompanied the satellite.</P>
      <P>Chen said he will lead a 20-member team to Los Angeles Dec. 2 to
begin preparations for the launch. "A lot of work, including
assembly, integration and testing, must be done before the
launch," he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan launched its first satellite -- ROCSAT-1 -- five years
ago. Chen said the launch of ROCSAT-2, which carries a price tag of
NT$4.7 billion, will lead Taiwan into a new era of space research.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, ROCSAT-2 is different from its predecessor in
that it will have practical applications involving remote-sensing
technology to help upgrade Taiwan's capability in disaster
prevention, land mapping and environmental monitoring.</P>
      <P>ROCSAT-2 can take pictures of objects on the ground as small as
two meters across, Chen said, adding that the satellite is designed
to orbit the Earth 14 times a day, including two passes over Taiwan,
at 891 km above the Earth.</P>
      <P>In addition to its remote sensing mission, ROCSAT-2 has the
scientific mission of investigating various lighting phenomena in the
upper atmosphere.</P>
      <P>Chen said ROCSAT-2 has a two-year life span. "But it may remain
functional longer than its shelf life, judging from the fact that
ROCSAT-1 remains operational five years after its launch into the
orbit," he added.</P>
      <P>The ROC government launched a 15-year space technology
development plan in 1991. In its initial stage, the NSPO is
concentrating on ROCSAT, which consists of three different satellite
ventures.</P>
      <P>ROCSAT-1 was built by the U.S. firm TRW and successfully launched
in 1999 from Cape Canaveral, Florida, while ROCSAT-3 is an ROC-U.S.
joint venture that will be launched in 2005. Some components of these
satellites will be manufactured in Taiwan under the auspices of
technology transfers from foreign contractors.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Defense Minister Lin Chong-pin
confirmed Monday that he will visit the United States in the near
future.</P>
      <P>Lin was responding to questions from lawmakers at a Defense
Committee meeting where he was asked to comment on a newspaper report
that he and Vice Chief of the General Staff Ju Kai-san are scheduled
to leave for Washington, D.C. Friday at the head of a high-profile
military mission for comprehensive talks on arms deals, Taiwan's
security and bilateral military cooperation. The two-week visit would
be the largest in scope in Taiwan-U.S. military talks in recent
memory, the report said.</P>
      <P>Lin said that all Taiwan-U.S. military engagements are conducted
under the framework of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) -- the U.S. law
that regulates exchanges with Taiwan in the absence of formal
diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>He declined to give details of his upcoming visit, saying only
that the visit is part of the routine Taiwan-U.S. military exchanges
under the TRA framework. At the moment, Lin went on, it remains
uncertain whether he will start his U.S. visit Friday.</P>
      <P>According to the newspaper report, Lin's mission will also visit
the U.S. Pacific Command in Hawaii, where a computer war game will be
conducted Dec. 15-17. The simulation is necessary for the United
States to update its military contingency plans to cope with a
possible escalation of tension across the Taiwan Strait in the run-up
to Taiwan's next presidential election on March 20, 2004, the
newspaper report said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, Lin said that even if there were a
computer war game scheduled, it would be routine and would have
planned long ago.</P>
      <P>Asked about his view of President Chen Shui-bian's claim a day
earlier that Beijing's deployment of 496 missiles aimed at Taiwan is
sufficient reason for a "defensive referendum" to be called on the
day of the March 20 presidential election, Lin said the People's
Liberation Army's (PLA's) threat to Taiwan has always existed.</P>
      <P>As to whether the threat is impending enough to justify the
holding of a "defensive referendum, " Lin said only that the PLA has
not taken any "evident military action" at the moment.</P>
      <P>Article 17 of the referendum law passed by the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan last Thursday empowers the
president to initiate a referendum on national security in the event
of an external military threat aimed at compelling a change in
Taiwan's status. The threat that could trigger such an action, dubbed
a "defensive referendum, " is tacitly seen as coming from mainland
China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT SOLICITS SUPPORT FOR NEW 10 MAJOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged legislators
across the party spectrum Monday to support his "new 10 major
construction projects" idea to create more favorable conditions for
Taiwan's progress and prosperity.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he and other government
officials presided over the inauguration ceremony of a new tunnel,
one of the most difficult sections of the Keelung River dredging
project. With the inauguration of the tunnel, the construction work
to divert floodwater is 52.1 percent complete, a little ahead of
schedule.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that even though the nearly 2.5-km tunnel
passes through three faults and a great number of disused mineshafts,
the construction workers completed the tunnel in little over a year.</P>
      <P>He also lauded the power and efficiency of his Cabinet with
regard to the project, saying that after the project is completed at
the end of next year, it will effectively reduce the water level of
the lower reaches of the Keelung River and will prevent flooding for
up to 200 years.</P>
      <P>He noted that when Typhoon Lynn hit Taiwan in 1987, the
floodwater inundated houses up to two stories high in Hsichi, Taipei
County. However, the Taiwan provincial government did nothing to
address the problem. After the streamlining of the provincial
government, the project received support from then-Premier Vincent
Siew and was further implemented with the continued efforts of his
successors, premiers Chang Chun-hsiung and Yu Shyi-kun.</P>
      <P>Chen said that if the project, which was delayed for 12 years,
could have been started earlier, it would have gone far toward
relieving flooding problems in greater Taipei.</P>
      <P>He expressed hope that legislators will support the new 10 major
construction projects unveiled earlier by the Executive Yuan,
including making rail transport faster and more convenient, building
mass transit systems in central, northern and southern Taiwan,
building a sewage system, constructing the third freeway and
intercontinental container center in Kaohsiung Harbor, upgrading
universities and research centers, and improving the information and
communication network in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed that public wants these projects to be implemented
as they will upgrade the overall competitive edge of Taiwan and
improve the quality of life.</P>
      <P>"We have no time to wait for 12 years for every major
construction project, " the president said, adding that "if the
dredging of the Keelung River had not started, we would pay a hefty
price today."</P>
      <P>"Similarly, if we do not implement the new 10 major projects
today, we will surely regret it tomorrow," he added.</P>

national referendum on March 20 on issues put forward by his party,
it seems there is no holding Chen's determination to do so.</P>
      <P>Citing an article successfully tacked on to the bill by the DPP,
Executive Yuan spokesman Lin Chia-lung argued Monday that should the
country be under threat, the president is authorized to call a
referendum after getting the endorsement of the Cabinet and that this
right is not subject to the approval of a commission founded for this
purpose under the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Lin said the country has always been under threat from mainland
China, which has targeted the island with almost 500 missiles, not to
mention repeated warning from Beijing's leaders that war is
inevitable should the island move on the path toward separating
itself from the mainland.</P>
      <P>The former government of the Kuomintang misled the people by
instilling a false sense of safety into their minds, Lin claimed.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, it is appropriate for the president to call a
referendum for March 20.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, Article 17 of the referendum bill, which reads
"...the president may put to referendum issues related to national
security..." is different from Article 16, which provides that the
legislature can initiate referendum proposals and refer them to the
referendum reviewing commission.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, he said, it would be "unreasonable and unnecessary"
to have a referendum proposal that is put forward by the president
and endorsed by the Cabinet reviewed again by a commission under the
Cabinet.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung shared the spokesman's
views, arguing that Beijing's military threat against the country is
a fact beyond dispute and the president would be exercising his legal
power by calling a referendum.</P>
      <P>He complained that KMT Chairman Lien Chan "hurt his feelings" by
claiming the previous day that it is harder to guard against the
president than it is to guard against a thief, adding that he cannot
understand why someone would try to block the president from rallying
the public behind the government in defense of the country.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu also claimed in Taipei County Monday
that the military threat from Beijing justifies the president's calls
for a referendum.</P>
      <P>At the other end of the political spectrum, both the KMT and its
political ally the People First Party (PFP) , which united with the
KMT to push through thereferendum bill Thursday, denounced the
president for what they described as abuse of power for political
gain.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Lee Chia-chin, secretary of the KMT legislative caucus,
said the president should follow the terms of the bill while
exercising his power.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Chou Hsih-wei, secretary of the PFP caucus, accused Chen
of trying to use referendum as a vote-getting trick.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO ALLOW PASSENGERS TO BRING UP TO 6,000 RENMINBI INTO COUNTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Passengers entering Taiwan will be allowed
to carry mainland Chinese currency of up to 6,000 renminbi with them,
beginning by the end of 2003, Vice Minister of Finance Chang
Hsiu-lien said Monday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Chang said inbound
passengers, presumably most of them Taiwan citizens returning from
trips to mainland China, will be allowed to carry renminbi with them
as part of the government's efforts to increase convenience for
people amid the rapid rise in cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>Currently, mainland Chinese currency is not allowed to be brought
into Taiwan by anybody. The opening policy, Chang said, has been
adopted by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) in compliance with a Statute
Governing the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the
Mainland Area amendment which was recently passed by the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the limit of 6,000 renminbi was decided upon
after the MOF took into consideration Taiwan's overall economic
development as well as the practices adopted by other countries.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chang said, mainland China's law prohibits mainland
citizens from taking more than 6,000 renminbi out of the country with
them. "It would be impractical if Taiwan were to allow people to
bring more than 6,000 renminbi into the country," she added.</P>
      <P>Currently, the maximum amount in foreign currency that people are
allowed to carry with them into Taiwan is US$10,000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN URGES KMT TO RETURN ILL-GOTTEN ASSETS TO NATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) to return the property that it had
illegally taken from individual persons or national coffers during
its nearly 55-year rule of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in a speech delivered at the opening of an
exhibition of photos, documents and artifacts featuring Taiwan's
human rights development as part of the celebrations of the upcoming
Dec. 10 World Human Rights Day.</P>
      <P>Chen said he was pleased to see KMT Chairman Lien Chan publicly
acknowledge that the KMT had committed many wrongdoings during its
rule of Taiwan, including one-party dictatorship, martial law and
human rights infringements.</P>
      <P>Addressing a Saturday campaign rally, Lien, the presidential
candidate of the opposition "pan-blue alliance, " said he was willing
to apologize for his party's wrongdoings during the martial law era.</P>
      <P>Chen said a public apology from Lien is not enough. "The most
important thing is action. Deeds speak louder than words. The KMT
should take action to redeem its past sins that once caused many
family breakups, social tragedies and distortions of human nature."</P>
      <P>One thing that the KMT should do to show its genuine repentance
is to return all the assets it had stolen from the people and the
nation, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Touching on World Human Rights Day celebrations, Chen said he
hopes the values and regulations of human rights, the rule of law and
democracy can take root in Taiwan's political, social and cultural
arenas as early as possible.</P>
      <P>In his 2000 inaugural speech, Chen said he outlined three key
principles regarding his human rights policy -- pushing the
legislature to pass and ratify the International Bill of Rights as a
domestic law of Taiwan so that it becomes the "Taiwan Bill of
Rights"; setting up an independent national human rights commission
in line with the United Nations requirements; and bringing Taiwan
back into the international human rights system.</P>
      <P>Chen urged the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan to support
his human rights policy and pass all relevant bills as soon as
possible to facilitate Taiwan's development into a "human rights"
power in the world.</P>
      <P>He lauded Academia Historica and the preparatory office of the
National Human Rights Museum for their joint efforts in organizing
the Taiwan human rights arts exhibition and establishing a new Taiwan
human rights information network.</P>
      <P>Chen further said he believes that with dedication and
confidence, "human rights seeds" will blossom in Taiwan in the 21st
century.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Immigration officers began to interview all
incoming mainland Chinese spouses of Taiwan citizens Monday as part
of the government's efforts to stem an influx of mainland immigrants
through marriages of convenience.</P>
      <P>The personal interview system was introduced for the first time
Sept. 1 after a spate of bogus marriage cases involving mainland
Chinese citizens were uncovered. Initially, only selected mainland
spouses were interviewed.</P>
      <P>From Oct. 1, the system was expanded to cover all mainland
Chinese spouses who were making their first visits to Taiwan and the
two ROC-held frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu, both of which lie
closer to the mainland than to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Starting Dec. 1, the system was further extended to cover all
arriving mainland Chinese spouses, including those who had visited
Taiwan before.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the Bureau of Immigration (BOI) under the
National Police Administration showed that between Sept. 1 and Nov.
27, 3,918 mainland spouses were interviewed upon their arrival and
470 of them, or 12 percent of the total, were determined to be in a
bogus marriage with a Taiwan citizen and were repatriated.</P>
      <P>During the same period, 1,037 incoming mainland spouses were
required to receive a second round of personal interviews after their
entry to Taiwan, accounting for 26 percent of all those interviewed
upon arrival. As of last Friday, second-round interviews had been
conducted on 737 of those people.</P>
      <P>After second-round interviews, 51 were determined to be in fake
marriages and were thus repatriated immediately; 80 were ordered to
leave Taiwan within a specified period of time and 32 of them had
left Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the future, BOI officials said they will use administrative
discretionary rights to have more people repatriated immediately
after second-round interviews to prevent overstays by those in bogus
marriages.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the officials said they will step up checks and
personal interviews on those who have entered Taiwan to deter
mainland people from trying to come to Taiwan through bogus
marriages.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MORE THAN 200 RUNAWAY FOREIGN LABORERS TURN THEMSELVES IN: CLA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 200 foreign laborers who have
absconded from their Taiwan jobs turned themselves in voluntarily
over the past three months, the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA)
reported Monday.</P>
      <P>About 70 percent of the foreign laborers who surrendered to
police between Sept. 1 and Nov. 30 for absconding were Indonesian
nationals, CLA officials said upon the conclusion of a three-month
assessment to examine why foreign laborers run away from their jobs
and whether CLA incentives encouraging these people to turn
themselves in voluntarily are working or not.</P>
      <P>CLA Chairwoman Chen Chu said in late October that a freeze on
admissions for new Indonesian laborers might be lifted by the end of
November if the three-month assessment proves that fewer Indonesian
workers already in the country have absconded from their jobs. Chen
said that the introduction of Vietnamese laborers might be halted as
well if their absconding rate has not dropped in the same three-month
period.</P>
      <P>To this concern, the CLA authorities have not made any comments
as of noon Monday, presumably because pertinent figures for November
are not yet available.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the National Police
Administration, a total of 890 foreign workers ran away from their
jobs in September, 430 of whom are Vietnamese.</P>
      <P>As of Oct. 31, nearly 11,200 foreign laborers remain unaccounted
for in Taiwan, including 1,953 Filipinos, 4,000 Indonesians, 1,480
Thais and 3,533 Vietnamese, CLA officials said.</P>
      <P>Pleased with the preliminary results of the three-month
assessment, the CLA will likely extend the period allowing more of
the absconded foreign laborers to report themselves, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>The CLA will also talk with domestic police authorities as well
as Taiwan offices of laborer-exporting Southeast Asian countries in
convincing them that the repatriation process period be shortened and
free air tickets should be provided for expatriation, as incentives
to persuade more absconded workers to emerge, the officials added.</P>
      <P>About 280,000 legal foreign laborers are working in Taiwan, most
of whom work in the manufacturing sector, according to CLA tallies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MORE PEOPLE ENTITLED TO FREE FLU VACCINATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More Taiwan residents will be given free flu
shots as winter approaches following the first wave of free flu
vaccinations provided to senior citizens and health care personnel in
September, the Department of Health (DOH) reported Monday.</P>
      <P>Health authorities are encouraging citizens aged over 55 to get
influenza vaccinations as a precaution against the flu as well as
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) this winter.</P>
      <P>The elderly, especially those with diabetes, who have a higher
risk of getting the flu, are more vulnerable to the disease in the
winter.</P>
      <P>In addition to seniors, health care personnel, including
pharmacists and school nurses, as well as physically- and
mentally-challenged people are also encouraged to get a flu shot, DOH
officials said.</P>
      <P>The DOH officials urged the public to pay more attention to the
flu, which has similar early symptoms to those of SARS. Approximately
10 percent to 20 percent of the Taiwan people get the flu each year,
with the medical costs for treatment reaching NT$31.2 billion
(US$917.65 million) annually.</P>
      <P>If the vaccinations can reduce the number of flu cases by 50
percent or 60 percent, this will considerably ease the workload of
medical workers who can then concentrate their energies on dealing
with real SARS cases if need be, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The DOH launched the first round of the flu vaccination campaign
Sept. 15, first among health workers, such as doctors and nurses
working at hospitals, and then the elderly aged over 65 Sept. 22.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, city-run schools of all levels in Taipei City began a
temperature-taking drive Monday. Regular temperature-taking is one of
the measures employed to guard against another SARS outbreak.</P>
      <P>SARS hit Taiwan hard between early March and late June this year,

wetlands reserve in the southern county of Tainan has not increased
significantly, local conservationists said Monday.</P>
      <P>The number of black-faced spoonbills wintering at the Chiku
wetlands in Tainan County usually peaks in the second half of
November, wild bird conservationists said.</P>
      <P>A record high number of 706 of the rare birds spent the winter in
the Chiku marshes last year.</P>
      <P>As of Sunday, only 617 black-faced spoonbills had arrived at the
Chiku wetlands at the estuary of the Tsengwen River, far lower than
the figure of 700 birds for the same time last year.</P>
      <P>Conservationists said that a worldwide black-faced spoonbill
census will be conducted next January and that it remains uncertain
at the moment whether the global population of the rare species has
declined due to the mass die-off that occurred in Taiwan late last
year and early this year as a result of botulism.</P>
      <P>Botulism caused the death of 73 of the birds between late last
year and early this year. According to wild bird experts, the
reproduction rate of the black-faced spoonbill ranges between 8
percent and 12 percent per year. Extrapolating from the deaths and
the reproduction rate, the maximum number of arrivals this year has
been estimated at around 700, the conservationists said.</P>
      <P>Each year, a large number of black-faced spoonbills migrate from
the Korean peninsula and northeastern mainland China to the Chiku
wetlands to spend the winter. The mass die-off last year was the
first such case on record involving the endangered species.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO PLANS TO EDUCATE MILITARY MEMBERS ON REFERENDUMS: MND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
currently has no plans to educate members of the armed forces' rank
and file on referendums even though the Legislative Yuan has recently
passed a referendum bill into law, an MND spokesman said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Chukuang Day" -- the day regularly reserved for education in the
military each week -- has not been used to give lessons about
referendums, MND spokesman Maj. Gen. Huang Suey-sheng said.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a regular news conference, Huang said all the
officers and soldiers in the military are certainly well aware of
their voting rights as citizens.</P>
      <P>Huang said that even if a referendum were held tomorrow, the ROC
armed forces would maintain the norms of its combat training and
preparedness.</P>
      <P>He added that the defense ministry is constantly monitoring the
movements of the mainland Chinese People's Liberation Army and that
it has found that the PLA has not made any unusual moves despite
mainland Chinese officials' saber rattling over the ROC Legislature's
passage of the referendum bill last Thursday.</P>
      <P>"We have not detected any abnormal movement of mainland Chinese
troops in recent weeks, " Huang said, adding that the PLA is only
conducting routine training activities at the moment.</P>
      <P>On questions of whether President Chen Shui-bian's advocacy
recently of a "defensive" referendum has caused any alterations in
the military deployments of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Huang
only said that it is a political issue and that he is not supposed to
comment on political issues of any kind.</P>
      <P>On another question about whether the defense ministry will go
along with the notion of "barracks voting, " or allowing the men and
women in uniform to cast their referendum ballots at the barracks,
Huang said this is an issue for the Ministry of the Interior to
deliberate, and not for the defense ministry.</P>

      <P>A major working for the Military
Intelligence Bureau (MIB) has been taken into custody by military
prosecutors with court approval for allegedly spying for Beijing,
according to a statement issued Tuesday by the Ministry of National
Defense.</P>
      <P>Maj. Pai Chin-yang, who is from Hong Kong, has worked for the MIB
since 1983 but was found to have run up heavy debts in 2001 following
failed investments in the stock market and was blacklisted by several
banks as a bad lending risk.</P>
      <P>But Pai's financial status improved significantly after a trip to
Thailand in January this year, during which, the ministry quoted the
MIB as saying, he came into contact with spies from mainland China.
He then began spending generously after a trip to Macau in September.</P>
      <P>He also became an enthusiastic worker, seeking opportunities to
access as much classified information as possible, apparently
motivated by the desire to collect valuable information for Beijing,
according to the ministry.</P>
      <P>In October, more evidence of his spying was uncovered and the MIB
assigned Pai to a job away from headquarters to prevent him from
coming into contact with classified information. Meanwhile, they fed
him with false information in an attempt to build an ironclad case
against him.</P>
      <P>The statement described Pai as a low-level MIB clerk with no
access to top secrets and in no position to do much damage to the
MIB.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian, who is determined
to carry out the country's first national referendum March 20, urged
his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) comrades Tuesday to come up
with issues that could be put to referendum.</P>
      <P>Presiding over a DPP meeting, Chen, who is also the DPP chairman,
called on his party comrades to suggest security-related issues for
the referendum, which he called a "defensive referendum" because it
is supposedly to be used only when the country's safety is threatened
by outsiders.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed hope that the hard-earned right to referendum will
be used to underscore Beijing's military threat to Taiwan and to
reflect public opinion.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Trong Chai suggested opposition to Beijing's "one
country, two systems" formula of unifying with Taiwan as an issue for
referendum, while others suggested that a referendum be held to "tell
Beijing to withdraw missiles aimed at Taiwan." No decision was taken
during the meeting.</P>
      <P>Chen himself had suggested earlier a referendum on whether to
continue with work on the fourth nuclear power plant and whether the
country should seek to join the World Health Organization.</P>
      <P>He also touted the new 10 major projects brought before the
legislature by the Executive Yuan at a budget of NT$500 billion
(US$14.7 billion) over five years as a series of measures designed to
turn the country into a first-class world power.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Business revenues chalked up by the Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park (HSIP) , Taiwan's top hi-tech
stronghold, in the first 10 months totaled NT$700 billion (US$20.58
billion) , up by 21.3 percent over the year-earlier level, park
authorities reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park Director James Lee said the
figure is nearly on par with the NT$705.5 billion level posted for
the whole of last year. He added that the full-year level for 2003 is
expected to hit up to NT$900 billion and the level for the whole of
2004 may break the NT$1 trillion mark, fueled by an ongoing economic
recovery.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the business climate at the leading industrial
park in northern Taiwan has noticeably improved since the third
quarter of this year after a recession of more than two years.</P>
      <P>Its business turnover during the first eight months also grew by
15 percent year-on-year to reach NT$515.5 billion, while its level
posted in the Sep.-Oct. period jumped by 49 percent from a year ago
to NT$184.5 billion, administration statistics show.</P>
      <P>At the same time, a total of 101,146 workers were employed as of
the end of October by companies based at the park, a rise of 3.3
percent as compared to the previous-year level.</P>
      <P>In October, the park's exports were valued at NT$43.4 billion,
representing a three-year, single-month high and an astounding growth
of 53 percent from a year ago. Its outbound shipments during the
first 10-month period totaled NT$316.3 billion, up by 9 percent over
the year-earlier period.</P>
      <P>Also, the park's imports in October were worth NT$24.6 billion,
an annual increase of 7 percent, while its combined level for the
first 10 months totaled NT$173.9 billion, down by 19 percent
year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, efforts to attract investment also have paid off, Lee
added. A total of 49 companies have set up shop in the compound and
channeled capital worth NT$29.821 billion since the beginning of this

      <P>In terms of the output value for the first eight months, the
semiconductor industry led five other major sectors with NT$343.3
billion, followed by the computer and peripherals industry with NT$80
billion in second place.</P>
      <P>The opto-electronics industry came in third with NT$51.9 billion,
while the telecommunications industry ranked fourth with NT$35.8
billion. The precision machinery garnered fifth spot with NT$3.4
billion, ahead of the biotechnology at sixth with NT$110 billion.</P>
      <P>Lee attributed the HSIP's growing production value to a larger
number of IC design companies opening shops in the park. He forecast
that the IC design industry will eventually replace the semiconductor
contractors based in the park as the leading contributor to its
business revenues.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN NOT TO HOLD REFERENDUM ON SOVEREIGNTY CHANGE: SPOKESMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's administration
will not hold any referendum that would involve a change to Taiwan's
sovereign status, a Presidential Office spokesman said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"A referendum that touches on sovereignty issues will not happen
so long as mainland China refrains from using force against Taiwan, "
said James Huang, director of the Presidential Office's Public
Affairs Department.</P>
      <P>Huang was responding to U.S. State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher's remarks a day earlier that the United States opposes any
attempt by either side of the Taiwan Strait to change the present
status quo in the region.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a regular news briefing, Boucher further said the
United States is opposed to Taiwan holding any referendum that could
lead to altering Taiwan's current status or to the island moving
toward de jure independence. Boucher also urged the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait to exercise self-restraint and not to issue statements
or take action that could escalate cross-strait tension or hinder a
resumption of bilateral dialogue.</P>
      <P>Boucher's statements came after President Chen declared over the
weekend that he will initiate a "defensive referendum" against
mainland China's military threat on the day of the next presidential
election on March 20, 2004.</P>
      <P>Huang said Boucher was mainly reaffirmed the stance of the U.S.
on cross-strait relations on the eve of mainland Chinese Premier Wen
Jiabao's visit to the United States.</P>
      <P>Stressing that President Chen has on many occasions reaffirmed
his commitment to the "four noes plus one" pledge outlined in his
2000 inaugural speech, Huang said the planned "defensive referendum"
will not touch on the sensitive "independence vs. unification" issue.</P>
      <P>Article 17 of Taiwan's newly passed referendum law empowers the
president to initiate a referendum on national security issues in the
event of an external threat. The threat which could trigger such an
action, dubbed a "defensive referendum, " is tacitly seen as coming
from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Addressing a Sunday rally in southern Taiwan supporting his
re-election bid, President Chen said Beijing's deployment of 496
missiles aimed at Taiwan was sufficient reason for a "defensive
referendum" to be called on the day of the March 20 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>Chen's declaration has drawn concerns that the move might provoke
Beijing, which has threatened to attack Taiwan should the island
declare independence.</P>
      <P>Huang said such concerns are unjustified, stressing that planned
"defensive referendum" will not breach the "four noes plus one"
pledge nor will it has anything to do with the "independence vs.
unification" issue. The government is still working on details
regarding the proposed "defensive referendum," he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Huang urged mainland China not to "interpret" Taiwan's
democratic development or reform plans purely from negative and
"independence vs. unification" perspectives.</P>
      <P>Huang reiterated that Taiwan's referendum legislation and plans
to write a new constitution that fits its present reality are
primarily aimed at "deepening and consolidating" its young democracy.</P>

      <P>Kiribati President Atone Tong will visit
Taiwan early next year, an official of the Ministry of Foreign

      <P>Lin Sung-huan, director-general of MOFA's Department of East

lead a delegation to visit Taiwan next February to boost relations.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that the Republic of China established diplomatic
relations with Kiribati Nov. 7 of this year based on the principles
of mutual benefits.</P>
      <P>Chen Su-liang, the ROC ambassador to Kiribati, presented his

Pacific island state is in operation, Lin said. Both countries are
ready to exchange and cooperate in the areas of agriculture, fishery,

      <P>Lin noted that mainland China has tried in vain to salvage its

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Yu Cheng-hsien
visited CKS International Airport in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan Tuesday
to see how procedures were being handled for interviewing all
arriving mainland Chinese spouses.</P>
      <P>Yu said that since the interview system was put in place Sept. 1,
the number of arriving mainland Chinese spouses has dropped 50
percent, which indicates that the word is out on the new policy and
has frustrated the efforts of some wishing to enter the country on
false pretenses.</P>
      <P>"The interviews will protect those who follow the law and targets
those who do not," Yu said.</P>
      <P>Yu asked immigration officers working in the airport to screen
carefully spouses from mainland China and come up with a standard
interview technique so that no fraudulent cases will slip through
their net.</P>
      <P>Along with vigorously screening the entry of mainland Chinese
spouses, Yu also said that the interior ministry will do its best to
provide assistance to legal foreign and mainland Chinese brides.</P>
      <P>Bureau of Immigration (BOI) Commissioner Tseng Wen-chang said
Tuesday that starting from Dec. 1, both husbands and wives applying
for a mainland spouse to come to Taiwan for a visit, reunion, or
residence and settlement will be interviewed.</P>
      <P>If a marriage is determined to be bogus, then the entry permit
for the mainland spouse will be revoked and the Taiwan resident will
also be prosecuted according to relevant criminal law.</P>
      <P>When a Taiwan resident applies for his or her mainland spouse's
entry, the applicant will be interviewed first and the application
will be rejected if there is doubt at that point.</P>
      <P>The interviews were first introduced Sept. 1 after a spate of
bogus marriage cases involving mainland Chinese people were
uncovered. Only selected mainland spouses were interviewed to verify
the veracity of their marriage at this stage.</P>
      <P>From Oct. 1, the system was expanded to cover all mainland
Chinese spouses who were making their first visit to Taiwan and the
two ROC-held front line islands of Kinmen and Matsu, both of which
lie closer to the mainland than to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Starting Dec. 1, the system was further extended to cover all
arriving mainland Chinese spouses, including those who had visited
Taiwan before.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the BOI under the National Police
Administration showed that between Sept. 1 and Dec. 1, 3,497 mainland
spouses were interviewed upon their arrival and 517 of them were
immediately repatriated because of their suspected intention to come
to Taiwan for prostitution or to work illegally.</P>
      <P>As of Monday, second-round interviews had been conducted on 892
individuals. After second-round interviews, 68 were determined to be
in fake marriages and were thus repatriated,.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FAMILY MEMBERS OFTEN ACCOMPLICES OF PERPETRATORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Nov. 2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Family members are often the accomplices of
perpetrators of domestic violence toward foreign wives of Taiwanese
men, a study conducted by a non-profit organization showed Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Garden of Hope Foundation made the comment based on its
interviews with 12 women from Southeast Asian countries such as
mainland China, Vietnam, Cambodian and Indonesia who have been
victims of domestic violence.</P>
      <P>One woman from mainland China who said that she strongly feels
the discrimination against her by her husband's family, said the
first incident of domestic violence was triggered by a rumor spread
by her mother-in-law, who seemed to enjoy the sight of her being
beaten by her husband.</P>
      <P>Another mainland Chinese spouse also said that her husband's
ex-wife and children join forces to beat her, and treat her as the
slave bought from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Yet another case is a 17-year-old woman from Cambodia. She said
that she wanted to come to Taiwan in the first place because she had
seen so many of her compatriots marry Taiwanese men. She was beaten
the third day after her arrival in Taiwan because she asked if she
could return home to visit family members after living in Taiwan for
six months.</P>
      <P>Based on the cases studied, foundation officials said that
domestic violence is mainly triggered by the lack of a solid
foundation between the foreign brides and their Taiwanese husbands,
emotionally unstable husbands, unfriendly family members, and poor
daughter-in-law and mother-in-law relations, all of which result in
the family members often becoming accomplices of the perpetrators of
violence.</P>
      <P>Chi Huei-jung, executive director of the foundation, said that
Taiwan, as a host country of foreign brides, should have formulated a
friendly policy to embrace the foreign bribes who are alone in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition, the government should implement rigorously its
rescue and assistance system, not only providing foreign bribes with
language learning opportunities but also courses or brochures about
their own rights so that they will know where to seek assistance when
in trouble.</P>
      <P>Chi urged people in Taiwan to treat foreign bribes with the
proper respect so that their children can grow up in a healthy
environment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT HAS NOT YET RETURNED ALL ILL-GOTTEN ASSETS TO NATION: DPP CAUCUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on Tuesday refuted the opposition
Kuomintang's (KMT) claim that it had returned all of its ill-gotten
assets to the nation.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, DPP Legislator Chou Ya-shu said
KMT Chairman Lien Chan was lying when he claimed a day earlier that
his party had returned all of its ill-gotten assets to the nation and
has entrusted the party's legal assets to professional trust
companies.</P>
      <P>"When the KMT was in power, it embezzled vast amounts of national
property. Lien should honestly face up to his party's past sins and
stop cheating on this issue, " Chou said, adding that the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party, which
controls a majority in the Legislative Yuan, should support the
passage of a bill that would legalizes investigations into assets
of major domestic political parties.</P>
      <P>Another DPP legislator, Lai Ching-teh, claimed that the KMT's
controversial assets could be divided into four categories --
properties taken over from the Japanese colonial government at the
end of World War II, such as the building of the Broadcasting Corp.
of China; properties snaffled from the government, including 19
theaters, 11 of which were sold secretly by the KMT; 115 pieces of
land given by city or county governments; and properties that the
government sold to the KMT at unreasonably low prices, such as the
KMT's present headquarters.</P>
      <P>"Among all these assets, the KMT has only returned about half of
the 115 pieces of land presented by local-level governments, " Lai
claimed.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen Chi-mai, also a DPP legislative whip, said the
KMT should explain why it has so far only returned half of land lots
donated by local-level governments and why it has dragged its feet on
handling other illegally obtained assets.</P>
      <P>Chen also questioned whether the KMT has truly entrusted its
assets to professional trust firms. Take the KMT-owned Central
Investment Co. as an example, Chen said.</P>
      <P>"The KMT said it has entrusted management of the firm to Credit
Suisse First Boston Co. But five of the firm's board members were KMT
stalwarts. The firm's management remains in KMT hands," Chen claimed.</P>
      <P>In response to the DPP legislative caucus' criticism, KMT
spokesman Tsai Cheng-yuan said his party has truly returned all of
its ill-gotten assets in accordance with current laws.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of an exhibition of artifacts and
documents featuring Taiwan's human rights development a day earlier,
President Chen Shui-bian also urged the KMT to return the property
that it had illegally taken from individual persons or national
coffers during its nearly 55-year rule of Taiwan.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) is seeking to exempt the country's taxi drivers from
paying fuel and license taxes for their vehicles that they use for
making a living, a KMT party whip said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lee Chia-chin said the KMT will shortly propose an amendment to
relevant laws to change taxis into a category of vehicles for
non-profit mass transportation, rather than the existing
profit-making business category.</P>
      <P>Lee said the amendment draft is aimed at being passed within
December so that the new policy can be put into force on Jan. 1,
2004.</P>
      <P>If the proposal were enacted into law, all taxi drivers of the
country, numbering nearly 100,000, will directly benefit, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee said it is not a scheme for drumming up support for the KMT
in the run-up to the upcoming presidential election. Rather, he
added, it is a "must-do" policy to seek justice for taxi drivers.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, a group of taxi drivers approached the
Executive Yuan to present their appeal for the cancellation of taxi
fuel and license taxes in November 2001, but were arrested on charges
of disturbing public order.</P>
      <P>As of Sept. 30, registered taxis islandwide totaled 98,540,
paying about NT$1 billion in fuel taxes annually. Lee said the NT$1
billion tax revenues may be an insignificant amount of income for the
government, but it is a huge sum that is important in the livelihood
of taxi drivers.</P>

      <P>An official in charge of aboriginal affairs
asked Tuesday that a higher aboriginal affairs budget be legislated
as an effective means to help raise the living standards of
aboriginal people to prevent "the weak from becoming weaker."</P>
      <P>Addressing a national conference on the welfare of aboriginal
people and related affairs, Cheng Tian-tsai, deputy director of the
Cabinet-level Council of Aboriginal Affairs, said indigenous people
have long been denied access to resources that have been sufficiently
provided to the non-aboriginal population due to low budgets and
inadequate laws.</P>
      <P>Cheng said unless the budgetary provisions are increased and
relevant laws revised, indigenous people have little hope of seeing
themselves fare any better.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, the per capita income of aboriginal people is
2.3 times lower than that of non-aboriginal people, while indigenous
people's unemployment rate is 1.7 times higher than that of
non-indigenous people.</P>
      <P>The percentage of people having received college or higher
education among indigenous people is 15 percent less than that of
non-indigenous people, while the percentage of people having received
only junior high education or lower among indigenous people is 16
percent higher than that of non-indigenous people, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>On average, aboriginal males have a shorter life expectancy than
their non-aboriginal counterparts of about 10 years, while the life
expectancy of women aborigines is five years shorter than that of
non-aboriginal women.</P>
      <P>By comparison, the percentage of aboriginal people who own their
own house is 8 percent less than that of non-aboriginal people, Cheng

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has
been helping health officials from Taiwan and Indonesia engage in
bilateral talks in the wake of an outbreak of dysentery among Taiwan
tourists who visited the Indonesian resort island of Bali last month.</P>
      <P>The number of confirmed dysentery cases among Taiwan tourists
returning from the island of Bali increased to 95 Monday, 55 more
than the level when the dysentery outbreak among Taiwan tourists was
first reported Nov. 23.</P>
      <P>The foreign ministry instructed Lin Yung-lo, Taiwan's top
representative in Indonesia, to travel to Bali Nov. 27 to gain
first-hand information about the situation and talk with Indonesian
health officials there about relevant matters, MOFA officials said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The officials said that Lin has been instrumental in helping
health officials from Taiwan and Indonesia to conduct direct dialogue
on the dysentery outbreak in a bid to facilitate eradication of the
diarrhea-like disease in Bali as well as treatment and recovery of
the Taiwan tourists.</P>
      <P>More than 300 of the tourists have been put under observation in
the wake of reports of a rising number of suspected cases of
dysentery among Taiwan tourists who visited Bali Nov. 7-22. Many of
them have reportedly developed fever, diarrhea and vomiting, with
some cases having been confirmed to be Shigella dysentery.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI CITY TO RECYCLE KITCHEN LEFTOVERS FROM DEC. 26</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei City will begin recycling kitchen
leftovers of regular households from Dec. 26, with a three-month
educational campaign to follow, the head of Taipei City Government's
Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Yung-jen, director of the EPB, urged the people to work in
tune with the new system and divide their kitchen leftovers into two
categories -- namely food scraps, which can be used to feed hogs, and
compost material, such as leaves and fruit peels.</P>
      <P>The kitchen leftovers will be collected under the same system as
the current five-day-per-week garbage collection system, he added.</P>
      <P>As the special containers for such garbage have not yet been
distributed to all Taipei City residents, the EPB has urged people
who have not yet received them to place their moist kitchen leftovers
into their own containers or in plastic bags to make the garbage
men's job easier.</P>
      <P>To familiarize the public with the new system, Taipei City
Government will launch a three-month educational campaign, Chen said.
After Feb. 26, if people mix their kitchen leftovers with their
regular garbage, they will be fined between NT$1,200 and NT$6,000
(US$35.19-US$175.95), he added.</P>
      <P>If people have any questions, they can call a kitchen leftover
hotline at (02) 2725-2818 between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. every day, or
call the EPB's 24-hour hotline at (02) 2720-6301,</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-U.S. COMMUNICATIONS CHANNELS SMOOTH: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is fully aware of the U.S. stance on
relations across the Taiwan Strait, and Taiwan-U.S. communications
channels have always been smooth, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
spokesman Richard Shih said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Shih made the remarks after U.S. Statement Department spokesman
Richard Boucher said a day earlier that the United States opposes any
attempt by either side of the Taiwan Strait to change the present
status quo in the region.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a regular news briefing, Boucher further said the
United States is opposed to Taiwan holding any referendum that could
lead to altering Taiwan's current status or to the island moving
toward de jure independence. Boucher also urged the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait to exercise self-restraint and not to issue statements
or take action that could escalate cross-strait tension or hinder a
resumption of bilateral dialogue.</P>
      <P>Boucher's statements came after President Chen Shui-bian declared
over the weekend that he will initiate a "defensive referendum"
against mainland China's military threat on the day of the next
presidential election on March 20, 2004.</P>
      <P>Responding to Boucher's comments, Shih said the MOFA is fully
aware of the U.S. stance on cross-strait ties. "As a matter of fact,
our communication channels at various levels have been smooth, " he
added.</P>
      <P>Noting that the referendum legislation is aimed at strengthening
Taiwan's democratic system, Shih said that President Chen has on many
occasions reaffirmed his commitment to the "four noes plus one"
pledge outlined in his 2000 inaugural speech and that the planned
"defensive referendum" will not touch on the ultra-sensitive
"independence vs. unification" issue.</P>
      <P>Article 17 of the referendum law passed by the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan empowers the president to
initiate a referendum on national security in the event of an
external military threat aiming to compel a change in Taiwan's
status. The threat which could trigger such an action, dubbed a
"defensive referendum, " is tacitly seen as coming from mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Addressing a Sunday rally in southern Taiwan supporting his
re-election bid, President Chen said Beijing's deployment of 496
missiles aimed at Taiwan was sufficient reason for a "defensive
referendum" to be called on the day of the March 20 presidential
election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POST-SARS DOMESTIC TOURIST TRIPS ON THE RISE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau's efforts to promote
domestic leisure trips in the wake of the severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) outbreak earlier this year have paid off, tourist
officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Quoting official tallies, they said visits to the island's 265
major sightseeing spots have increased steadily since July when the
Tourism Bureau began to implement a series of tourist promotional
activities in cooperation with travel service operators.</P>
      <P>The SARS outbreak between March and June of this year dealt a
severe blow to the local travel industry. To revitalize the sector,
the Tourism Bureau pooled domestic tourist resources and introduced
innovative tour packages.</P>
      <P>According to official statistics, the 265 major scenic spots
attracted 150,000 visits in July, and the number increased to
190,000-plus in August, 2000,000-plus in September, 223,000 in
October and 238,000 in November.</P>
      <P>Compared with the year-earlier levels, the number of visits grew
by 15 percent for September and by an even more remarkable 35 percent
for October.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the numbers still fell below the average of 250,000
visits per month registered over the first three months of this year.</P>
      <P>In a public ceremony held earlier in the day, Tourism Bureau
Director Su Cheng-tien drew lots to determine the winners of prizes
offered in a tourist promotional program that ran from Aug. 4 to Nov.
24. The prizes are worth a total of NT$80 million, including eight
cars, 15 international flight tickets, five notebook computers, as
well as specially-designed Giant bicycles, digital cameras and free

    <HEADLINE>RECORD NUMBER OF SPOONBILLS GRACING TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan County,  Dec. 3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The wetlands in the southern Taiwan
county of Tainan still boast the world's largest number of
black-faced spoonbills as a total of 706 of the rare migratory birds
have reportedly arrived here this year to winter as of Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the private Tainan Black-Faced Spoonbills
Conservation Association, a total of 598 black-faced spoonbills have
been sighted in the area at the mouth of the Tsengwenchi River and
the surrounding Chiku wetlands so far this year, while another 108
have been sighted near the Sitsao wetlands area of Tainan City,
bringing the total to 706.</P>
      <P>The figure is the highest in Taiwan in three years, greater than
the 705 recorded by Dec. 2, 2002, and the 601 posted by the same date
in 2001. A total of 1,069 of the rare birds were counted in a global
black-faced spoonbill population survey conducted in January this
year, wild bird conservationists from the association said.</P>
      <P>The conservationists said they had worried that the number of the
rare birds' arrivals might decline substantially this year due to the
mass die-off that occurred in Taiwan late last year and early this
year as a result of botulism.</P>
      <P>However, Wednesday's figure has proved that Tainan remains the
most popular transit habitat for black-faced spoonbills despite the
botulism outbreak, the conservationists said.</P>
      <P>Botulism caused the death of 73 of the endangered wild birds
between late last year and early this year. According to wild bird
experts, the reproduction rate of the black-faced spoonbill ranges
between 8 percent and 12 percent per year. Extrapolating from the
deaths and the reproduction rate, the maximum number of arrivals this
year had been estimated at around 700, the conservationists said.</P>
      <P>A total of 17 black-faced spoonbills had contracted botulism but
were treated by Tainan vets and then released back into the wild
early this year. Of these birds, 15 were found to have returned to
Tainan again late this year, while one was spotted in Japan recently,
according to the Tainan bird watchers. The other bird remained
unaccounted for as of Wednesday, they added.</P>
      <P>Black-faced spoonbills migrate from North Asia to the warm
wetlands in Taiwan and other Asian lower-latitudinal countries
between late September and early December every year to spend the
winter and avoid their cold northern breeding grounds. The birds then
return north around April or May of the next year.</P>
      <P>The Tainan wetlands are technically not just an ideal habitat for
black-faced spoonbills alone as currently there are about 100 other
kinds of migratory wild birds staying around the Tsengwenchi River,
Chiku and Sitsao areas, making the southern wetlands a haven for
Asian migratory feathered species.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. POLICY ON TAIWAN HAS NOT CHANGED: ROC FOREIGN MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  3 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene Chien
said Wednesday that the policy of the United States on Taiwan has not
changed, which means that the United States does not support the
independence of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chien made the remarks in response to questions from reporters on
whether the United States has changed its Taiwan policy from "not
supporting" to "opposing" Taiwan independence after U.S. State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Tuesday that the United
States would be opposed to any referendum that would change Taiwan's
status or move towards independence.</P>
      <P>Chien noted that Boucher's remarks was clarified later by Adam
Ereli, deputy spokesman of the U.S. Department of State, who said
Boucher's remarks cannot be construed as opposition by the United
States to Taiwanese independence.</P>
      <P>"I would say we choose our words carefully, and our policy is
that we don't support Taiwanese independence," Ereli said.</P>
      <P>"I think that our policy is clear, and our policy is not to
support Taiwanese independence. And that's the position, you know, we
have elaborated, that is the position we're going to stick with, "
Ereli added.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian recently said he would hold a "defensive
referendum" on the day of the March 20, 2004 presidential election,
because Beijing's deployment of 496 missiles targeting Taiwan is a
sufficient reason for holding such a referendum.</P>
      <P>A referendum law passed recently by the Legislative Yuan gives
the president the right to initiate a referendum on national security
issues in case of an external threat.</P>
      <P>Chen's movement has been construed by mainland China as a
possible attempt to shift the status quo.</P>
      <P>Chien stressed that as Washington and Taipei have maintained good
relations, it is natural that the United States would express concern
on Taiwan's elections and its democratic development.</P>
      <P>The communications between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
the United States have been very smooth, and foreign ministry
officials have given the message to the United States that Taiwan's
referendum will not touch on the topic of independence or
unification, Chien added.</P>
      <P>Referring to Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's upcoming visit to the
United States, Chien said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has set up
a ad-hoc committee to study his trip.</P>
      <P>Chien said he thinks the United States government will not do
anything that will be harmful to Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>The New York Times: Russia to reject pact
on climate, Putin aide says.

A senior Kremlin official said Tuesday that Russia would not
ratify the Kyoto Protocol, the international treaty requiring cuts in
emissions of gases linked to global warming. A total of 120 countries
have ratified the treaty. Russia's rejection could be a fatal blow to
the treaty which can take effect only when approved by enough
countries to account for 55 percent of 1990 emissions from the
industrial world. With the United States and Russia, that threshold
cannot be met.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>AIT CHIEF DENIES REPORT ON OPPOSITION TO TAIWAN INDEPENDENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  3 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Director of the Taipei office of the
American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Douglas Paal denied reports
Wednesday that he had suggested that United States President George
W. Bush openly announce his opposition to Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>In an interview with Central News Agency (CNA) , Paal said that
the reports were "totally groundless."</P>
      <P>The Wall Street Journal said in its editorial Dec. 3 that both
Paal and James Moriarty, senior director of Asian affairs at the U.S.
National Security Council, want Bush to change U.S. policy on Taiwan
independence from one of neutral "non-support" to active and
presumably public "opposition."</P>
      <P>The AIT chief also described reports by Taiwan media that the
U.S. State Department has called him home for consultations as
"ridiculous."</P>
      <P>Referring to another report that Moriarty was recently in Taipei
to convey President Bush's concerns to President Chen Shui-bian about
the holding of referendums, Paal said that he does not know whether
Moriarty had visited Taipei or not and that he would not comment.</P>
      <P>Dean Anderson, a spokesman for AIT, echoed Paal's statement by
saying that Paal has no plans to return to Washington, D.C. in the

    <HEADLINE>WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL VISITED TAIPEI: U.S. SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  2 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>James Moriarty, senior director for
Asian affairs of the U.S. National Security Council, had indeed made
an undisclosed visit to Taipei in the past few days, a U.S. China
hand said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>John J. Tkacik, a Heritage Foundation research fellow who once
worked at the Department of State, said he has received confirmation
from reliable sources that Moriarty visited Taipei recently to
exchange views with senior Taiwan officials on the latest
developments in cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Tkacik said Moriarty has already left Taipei but is still in
Asia. "Moriarty is scheduled to return to Washington, D.C. Thursday,"
he added.</P>
      <P>Moriarty is likely to be in Beijing at present to negotiate
certain details regarding mainland Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's
upcoming visit to the United States, particularly those related to
cross-strait ties. Wen is scheduled to arrive in New York Sunday and
will travel to Washington, D.C. Tuesday to start his first official
visit to the United States since taking office.</P>
      <P>Tkacik said he thought that Moriarty should have an important
agenda to consult with senior Taiwan officials. To the best of his
understanding, Tkacik said the Bush administration was originally
scheduled to hold a meeting of deputy chiefs of various departments
Tuesday to set the tone regarding Wen's upcoming visit.</P>
      <P>It was worthy of concern that Moriarty traveled to Taiwan before
the Bush administration set its tone on Wen's visit, Tkacik said,
adding that this should be related to a seeming escalation of tension
in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Commenting on State Department spokesman Richard Boucher's
remarks a day earlier that the United States would be opposed to any
referendum that would change Taiwan's status or move toward
independence, Tkacik said it seems to him that Boucher's remarks
signal a change in U.S. policy toward cross-strait relations, even
though relevant State Department officials had reiterated to him that
the U.S. policy toward Taiwan remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tkacik said he agreed with ROC President Chen
Shui-bian's statement that Beijing's deployment of nearly 500
missiles aimed at Taiwan is sufficient reason for a "defensive
referendum" to be called March 20, 2004 -- the day of the next
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Article 17 of Taiwan's newly passed referendum law empowers the
president to initiate a referendum on national security issues in the
event of an external threat. The threat that could trigger a
"defensive referendum" is tacitly seen as coming from the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chen's declaration aroused concern that the move might provoke
Beijing, which has threatened to attack Taiwan should the island
declare independence.</P>
      <P>In his view, Tkacik said, whenever Beijing equates Taiwan
independence to war, Taiwan should retort it with the declaration
that an attack from Beijing means Taiwan independence.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet will decide whether to request
the Legislative Yuan reconsider the newly passed referendum law next
Monday, a senior official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Cabinet spokesman Lin Chia-lung made the remarks after Premier Yu
Shyi-kun directed Minister-without-Portfolio Hsu Chih-hsiung at a
weekly Cabinet meeting to make an overall review of the referendum
law passed by the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan last
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The referendum law was sent to the Presidential Office earlier in
the day for promulgation. According to the ROC Constitution, the
Cabinet may request the legislature to reconsider a law within 10
days of the promulgation in case it deems the law difficult to
execute. If after reconsideration, more than half of the legislators
present at the meeting uphold the original bill, the Cabinet must
abide by the bill.</P>
      <P>Lin said a final decision will be made on whether to ask the
legislature to reconsider the referendum bill at a meeting of
officials from the Presidential Office, the Cabinet and the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) headquarters next Monday.</P>
      <P>"It will also be decided at the meeting whether to ask for
reconsideration of all provisions of the bill or just some of its
clauses," Lin said.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet had requested the Legislative Yuan reconsider various
bills on eight previous occasions, including the bill on allocation
of government revenues in 2002, the Labor Standard Law in 1995 and
the Legislative Yuan Organizational Law in 1993.</P>
      <P>The DPP legislative caucus said it will urge the Cabinet to
request the legislature reconsider some controversial provisions in
the newly passed referendum bill, such as the clause that empowers
the Legislative Yuan to initiate a referendum and the provision
requiring the formation of a committee to screen referendum
proposals.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 3 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and Japan are currently assessing the
possibility of signing a free trade agreement (FTA), but the reality
of such an accord remains some way off, an official with the Bureau
of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the BOFT official, the bureau will do its utmost to
push for such an agreement with Japan, and relevant authorities in
the two countries are conducting an evaluation of the issue.</P>
      <P>The official's remarks came after a foreign media report that two
major economic groups in Thailand and Japan recently inked a pact on
closer economic cooperation -- mainly on cutting customs tariffs and
easing regulations to erase trade barriers -- to pave the way for a
much-anticipated FTA. It is expected that the two countries will
launch FTA talks next week.</P>
      <P>Given that Japan is Thailand's largest direct foreign investor,
the cooperation pact will help Thailand largely sharpen its
international competitiveness against mainland China and countries in
the Middle East and South Asia, especially in the car, home
appliances and electronics industries, the official commented.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the pact will also help Japan make inroads
into the promising Southeast Asian market, which boasts of a
population of 570 million people, he said.</P>
      <P>Amid Japan's full drive to forge FTAs with countries in the
region, which also includes Malaysia and the Philippines, he said the
BOFT will do its best to push for such an accord with Taiwan,
although it may take some more time to see any results.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MONEY HAS ROLE IN SENSE OF ACHIEVEMENT: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Money plays a role in people's sense of
achievement, according to the results of a mental health survey
released by a private mental health promotion group Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 1,077 randomly chosen adult residents,
conducted by the Mental Health Foundation from Oct. 17-22 found that
those who have a monthly income of NT$80,000 or over are most
optimistic about the future.</P>
      <P>The survey results also show that for the respondents, the higher
one's income, the higher one's sense of achievement.</P>
      <P>In contrast, those who have received tertiary education do not
necessarily feel a strong sense of achievement, according to the
poll.</P>
      <P>Nearly 58 percent of the respondents said they think the future
will be better than the present, while 42 percent said they think
otherwise.</P>
      <P>A background analysis shows that those with higher income
(NT$80,000 or over) and higher education are generally more
optimistic about the future.</P>
      <P>In comparison, male respondents, elderly people and those who
have less education, are divorced, widowed or separated, are
generally more pessimistic about their futures.</P>
      <P>An interesting finding is that those with less education enjoy a
higher degree of sense of achievement than those with tertiary
education.</P>
      <P>Compared with the findings of a similar survey conducted last
year, the mental health of this year's respondents was slightly
better than that of those surveyed last year, even though their
average score in the foundation's zero-to-100-point scale was still
two points short of a passing grade of 80 points.</P>
      <P>A foundation spokesman attributed the progress to a combination
of factors, including the steady economic recovery, social stability
and a relatively improved public health environment in the wake of
the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak of earlier this year.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, one out of every three respondents said
they suffer from sleep disorders, fatigue and susceptibility to
despair or depression.</P>
      <P>Dr. Hu Hai-kuo, director of National Taiwan University Hospital's
mental health department, said an ordered life, regular workouts and
rest are key elements to mental health.</P>

      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
proposed Wednesday that the government put the issue of a name change
for Taiwan's official designation on its planned referendum slated
for March 20 along with the next presidential election.</P>
      <P>TSU Secretary-General Lin Chih-chia urged President Chen
Shui-bian to include the issue in the planned referendum "in order to
underscore Taiwan's sovereignty and national dignity" to mainland
China and the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>Taiwan can only make its sovereignty and national dignity clear
to the world and win its respect by changing its official title of
the Republic of China, Lin claimed.</P>
      <P>The TSU's proposal came on the heels of comments made recently by
Washington officials on the U.S. stance on Taiwan that reiterated
that the United States does not support Taiwan independence and would
be opposed to a referendum that would change Taiwan's status quo.</P>
      <P>Lin claimed that the officials made the comments to placate
Beijing prior to a visit by mainland Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and
to serve as a warning to Beijing's threat of the use of force against
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Chiou I-jen, secretary-general to the president,
Chen is expected to come up soon with issues to be contained in what
he calls a defensive referendum, which could be held when the
nation's security is threatened by outside forces.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Substantive relations between the Republic
of China and Canada are growing steadily despite the absence of
formal diplomatic ties, ROC Representative to Canada Chen Tong-pi
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Addressing a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs
Committee, Chen said the Canadian government's previous pro-Beijing
policy once hampered growth in bilateral exchanges and cooperation.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he went on, Taiwan-Canadian ties have managed to
make progress through the concerted efforts of diplomatic staff over
the years.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Canadian parliament's passage of a resolution
earlier this year supporting Taiwan's participation in the World
Health Assembly -- the governing body of the World Health
Organization -- marked a breakthrough in bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Under its "one China" policy, Chen said, the Canadian government
only supports Taiwan's participation in international trade and
economic organizations, such as the World Trade Organization and the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. As for organizations that
require statehood, he added, Canada has adopted a cautious "no
support, no opposition or conditional support" attitude.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen touted the achievements in promoting
parliamentary exchanges in recent years, noting that more than 110 of
the 300 Canadian parliamentarians have visited Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chen said, Canadian parliamentarians have formed an
amity association to promote exchanges and cooperation with Taiwan's
Legislative Yuan. "The association now has 110 members, making it the
largest of its kind in the Canadian parliament," he added.</P>
      <P>With the establishment of a parallel friendship association by
Taiwan legislators Oct. 31, Chen said he is convinced that
Taiwan-Canada parliamentary exchanges will become even closer in the
future.</P>
      <P>In the face of mainland China's intensified campaign to sway the
allegiance of ROC expatriates, Chen said he has spared no efforts to
strengthen contacts with the overseas Chinese community in Canada
since assuming office.</P>
      <P>The ROC representative office in Canada has forged strong ties
with all associations of Taiwan expatriates there, regardless of
their party affiliation, Chen said, adding that branches of the
Global Alliance for Democracy and Peace have been set up in six
Canadian cities, including Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal.</P>
      <P>As incoming Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin has long been
active in international affairs, Chen said the ROC government should
step up efforts to promote engagements with Canada for mutual
benefit.</P>
      <P>"We should endeavor to lobby the Canadian government to play a
stronger pro-Taiwan role in the international arena," Chen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FARMERS ASSOCIATIONS MUST PLAY GREATER ROLE IN AGRICULTURAL PROMOTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 3 (CNA)
(By Flora Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Farmers' associations should diversify their
roles to help local farmers widen their business scope and explore
the domestic and foreign markets, experts said Wednesday at a seminar
aimed at seeking new horizons for farmers' organizations.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the seminar, which was jointly sponsored by the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) and the Chinese National
Association of Industry and Commerce, Lin Chin-hung, chairman of the
National Training Institute for Farmers' Organizations, said farmers'
associations should adjust their structure to better serve farmers in
rural and urban areas.</P>
      <P>Farmers' associations in the countryside are often troubled by
lack of budget for conducting promotional activities, while those in
urban areas are healthier financially but lack customers to serve,
Lin said, pointing out that their operational earnings are not
sufficient to aid the farmers they represent.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, farmers' associations nationwide register a
total business turnover of nearly NT$30 billion (US$870 million) each
year from a wide range of operations, but their profits are limited.
A majority of 243 are slightly profitable, five are in the red and
five are breaking even, he added.</P>
      <P>The Taipei County Farmers' Association is the most profitable,
with annual earnings of just over NT$21 million, he noted.</P>
      <P>Stressing the need for in-depth agro-financial reform, Lin urged
farmers' associations to sharpen their competitiveness in
distribution, processing, warehousing and exports.</P>
      <P>Day Sheng-tong, chairman of the Republic of China Small and
Medium Business Association, said Taiwan's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO) has had a great impact on the agricultural
industry and he urged the sector to make bold adjustments to embrace
the coming challenges by setting up distribution networks in the
international market.</P>
      <P>Farmers' associations should play an institutionalized role of
product distributor and marketing organization, as well as
information researchers and training centers for farmers, to help
them create brand names that can win a greater presence in the
international market, he said.</P>
      <P>Agricultural reform, mainly focusing on the financial divisions
of the farmers' associations, has been one of the major topics on the
government's agenda.</P>

      <P>More aboriginal students will be selected to
receive government-funded athletic training when the second phase of a
Ministry of Education (MOE) training plan begins shortly, an MOE
official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In the second phase of the plan, the MOE will open four more
categories -- gymnastics, taekwando, weightlifting and judo -- to
allow indigenous students who have shown talent in athletic ability
to receive professional training, said Wang Fu-lin, director of the
MOE's Department of Physical Education.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, during the first phase of the plan, which
began in 1989, some 300 aboriginal students were selected to receive
professional athletic training focusing on track-and-field.</P>
      <P>The 1989 figure has been weeded down to 48 as of this year, said
Wang, adding that the 48, after years of training, have become
high-caliber athletes who have won 72 gold medals, 65 silvers and 42
bronzes in numerous competitions at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>Pan Ming-chang, a track-and-field coach at the Taitung Athletics
Experimental School in eastern Taiwan who has been involved in the
MOE training program for many years, gave a thumbs-up to the program,
saying that the athletic training has not only helped heighten the
aboriginal youths' self-esteem, it has helped nurture athletic talent
among the aboriginal people.</P>
      <P>The program has also helped improve relations between aboriginal
parents and their children who took part in the program, as the
youths have become more confident in and comfortable with themselves,

build an anti-missile system while bolstering its retaliatory
capabilities in the face of the increasing missile threat from
mainland China, Vice Minister of Defense Chen Ti-tuan said at the
Legislative Yuan Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in response to a question raised by
opposition People First Party Legislator Lin Yu-fang from Taipei
City, who wanted confirmation of news reports that President Chen
Shui-bian told the United States recently that Taiwan will put the
purchase of Patriot missiles at the top of a list of weaponry systems
procurement items.</P>
      <P>Chen confirmed the truth of the reports, saying that the purchase
of six Patriot PAC-3 batteries -- among the priorities of a 10-year
weaponry system procurement plan -- is scheduled to be fulfilled by
the end of next year.</P>
      <P>The deputy defense minister said that mainland China's submarine

      <P>Ereli was responding to questions as to whether State Department

opposed to Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Boucher said at a regular news briefing that the United States
would be opposed to any referendum that would "change Taiwan's status

      <P>Asked whether Boucher's remarks were equivalent to opposition to
Taiwan independence, Ereli said Boucher's statements should not be
interpreted as U.S. opposition to Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>"We choose our words very carefully and I'm not going to change

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Yu Cheng-hsien said
Wednesday that it would be more cost efficient if the "defensive"
referendum were held in sync with the next presidential election as
recommended by President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan Home and Nations
Committee, Yu said that holding a referendum would cost between
NT$400 million (US$11.76 million) and NT$500 million (US$14.7
million) and that money could be saved if it were held simultaneously
with the presidential election which is slated for March 20, 2004.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks in response to a question raised by
opposition People First Party Legislator Tsao Yuan-chang from the
outlying island of Matsu who asked Yu where he thinks the extra money
to finance the "defensive" referendum will come from if such a
national plebiscite indeed is held early next year.</P>
      <P>Yu said that as far as he knows, neither the Ministry of the
Interior nor the Central Election Committee have budgeted funds for
the holding of any referendums. If a referendum is held, the
government's Second Reserve Fund may have to be used, he said, adding
that holding the referendum on the day of the presidential election
would save a lot in costs.</P>

    <DATELINE>Hong Kong,  Dec 4.  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan issue is intruding upon the
forthcoming Sino-U.S. summit between mainland Chinese Premier Wen
Jiabao and U.S. President George W. Bush, the Asian Wall Street
Journal reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>The report, headlined "Taipei Changes Wen's Trip, " said that the
Taiwan issue is intruding upon next week's summit, upsetting an
agenda heavily focused on critical trade disputes and disrupting
recently cooperative U.S.-Chinese relations.</P>
      <P>It said that events in Taiwan in recent weeks have forced Beijing
and Washington to confront their sharp differences over the island.</P>
      <P>"The rising tensions over a perennial point of friction come just
before mainland Chinese Premier Wen Jia-bao meets President George W.
Bush in Washington Tuesday," it said.</P>
      <P>According to the report, their talks are supposed to concentrate
on the United States' ballooning trade deficit with mainland China,
perceived barriers to mainland Chinese markets and other economic
disagreements that have roiled relations but whose fallout both
governments have tried to contain.</P>
      <P>"Circumstances, however, are putting Mr. Wen and the Communist
leadership in a bind, pinning them between China's two foremost
strategic goals: nourishing a vital economy that's buoyed by smooth
U.S. relations and absorbing Taiwan without angering Washington,
which by law is committed to assisting Taiwan's defense," it said.</P>
      <P>These dynamics are pushing Wen into a tightrope act during his
upcoming four-day visit to the United States, it said, adding that he
is expected to lay down mainland China's position on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The report said that the Taiwan issue is also constraining
Washington's room to maneuver as well as further complicating its
relations with mainland China.</P>
      <P>"Bush is trying to balance stronger support for Taiwan with the
need for Chinese help on trade and North Korea while mollifying his
conservative Republican base," the report said.

Taiwan, or 106.15 percent of its population, which ranks the island
the first among the 182 economies covered in the report.</P>
      <P>Luxemburg follows closely behind in second place, with only 0.1
percentage points less.</P>
      <P>However, the two countries reversed their order when fixed-line
telephones were calculated in, with Luxemburg leading far ahead of
Taiwan, 185.74 percent to 164.31 percent.</P>
      <P>With a population of 23 million, Taiwan boasts 37 million
telephones, including 22.8 million mobile phones, or 65 percent of

      <P>Luxemburg is predicted to catch up with Taiwan in 2005, by which
time 118.09 percent of its population is expected to have a mobile
phone, compared to 114.29 percent in Taiwan, according to the report.</P>
      <P>As to the percentage of population that use computers, Taiwan,
with 39.46 percent, lags far behind the 70.87 percent recorded by the

      <P>However, if measured by the number of households, Taiwan boasts a
record of 72 percent, second in the world next only to the 75 percent
of Switzerland.</P>
      <P>Taiwan comes in 18th place in Internet users as a percentage of

(By Jorge Liu &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Taiwanese in the United
States urged Beijing Thursday to follow Taiwan's lead in embracing
democracy.</P>
      <P>In an open letter issued prior to People's Republic of China
Premier Wen Jiabao's arrival, the Taiwanese Association of America
said the PRC should take lessons in democracy from Taiwan rather than
threaten the island's burgeoning democracy with force.</P>
      <P>Noting that Wen warned in an interview with the Washington Post
last week that his country will not sit on its hands if Taiwan tries
to separate from China, the letter said the PRC's attempts to bluff
will not work as Taiwan is an independent country whose people will
never give up their hard-earned freedom.</P>
      <P>Instead of trying to frighten Taiwan away from developing
democracy, the letter says, Beijing should rein in its corrupt

Iowans have never before been bombarded with so many
advertisements from so many candidates so early in presidential
campaign season. The four major Democratic candidates competing in
Iowa -- Dr. Dean, Mr. Kerry, Senator John Edwards and Mr. Gephardt -- 
have run at least 4,450 spots in Des Moines alone since January.

The competition over the airwaves is most ferocious in Iowa but
is by no means limited to this state. In the nation's top 75 media

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
warned Taiwan businessmen Thursday of a potential investment crisis
in mainland China, especially on the financial front.</P>
      <P>The MOEA issued the warning in a report carried out by the
Committee of Economic Research and Development under its auspices.</P>
      <P>Although the mainland economy will continue to grow fast in 2004,
the report claimed that some signals of systematic financial and
economic problems have emerged and it urged Taiwan businessmen to be
extremely cautious when weighing investment there.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the mainland still managed to attract a
great deal of foreign investment this year, some US$40.238 billion of
which was already capitalized during the first three quarters. It
estimated that the mainland's exports and imports in the first nine
months might will amount to US$606.3 billion in value.</P>
      <P>Citing forecasts by relevant mainland authorities, the report
said the mainland economy will expand by more than 8 percent in 2004.</P>
      <P>However, the report warned that risks, such as a speculation for
renminbi's strong appreciation, inadequate investment in
infrastructure and mounting financial loans and money supplies, will
accompany the ongoing influx of international hot money taking
advantage of the mainland's booming economy.</P>

      <P>China Airlines (CAL) , Taiwan's largest
carrier, will recruit 200 to 300 foreign pilots in the coming year to
meet its operational demands, a company spokesman said in Vancouver
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Liu Fang-you, a senior executive of CAL's flight affairs
department who arrived in Vancouver earlier this week to preside over
interviews of Canadian pilots hoping to work for CAL, said more than
40 Air Canada pilots have registered for the first round of interviews
to be held Thursday and Friday. Those who pass the first-round
interviews will then travel to Taipei for physical checkups and
second-round interviews.</P>
      <P>Liu said CAL has plans to open new routes and will gradually take
delivery of 18 new passenger and cargo planes ordered from Airbus Co.
and Boeing Co. in the coming years. In the meantime, about 50 of its
current pilots will retire in the next two years.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Liu said, the carrier badly needs
experienced foreign pilots and co-pilots. "We need to recruit 200 to
300 new pilots," he added.</P>
      <P>CAL presently has 941 pilots, 204 of whom are foreigners from 30
countries. Australians form the bulk of CAL's foreign pilot force,
followed by Canadians.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSU LAUNCHES LETTER CAMPAIGN CALLING FOR U.S. SUPPORT FOR REFERENDUM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) issued an open letter to U.S. President
George W. Bush Thursday urging him to support Taiwan's holding of a
referendum to resolve its sovereignty and status issues.</P>
      <P>The pro-independence TSU, an ally of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , also launched a campaign encouraging the
people of Taiwan to send letters to Bush pushing him to support the
"sovereignty referendum" proposal.</P>
      <P>According to the TSU letter, holding a referendum on Taiwan's
sovereignty and independent status is a move to demonstrate to the
United States and the international community what the party claims
is Taiwan's "mainstream public opinion and values."</P>
      <P>The move is not only correct but also complies with the
prevailing world trend, the letter claims.</P>
      <P>It also urges Bush and his administration not to regard Taiwan as
a troublemaker. Bush should respect and support the Taiwan people's
right to "be the masters of Taiwan's destiny" and "let Taiwan be
Taiwan of the world, not of China."</P>
      <P>TSU legislative whip Lo Chih-ming said that because of Beijing's
opposition, Taiwan has been unable to join the United Nations and
many other international organizations.</P>
      <P>"The embargo seems to deprive Taiwan of its sovereign status,"
Lo said, adding that the TSU letter is aimed at letting Bush
understand the Taiwan people's strong desire to be "masters of
Taiwan's destiny."</P>
      <P>The TSU noted that Bush's official e-mail address is
"president@whitehouse.gov" and urged local citizens to support its
"one person, one letter to Bush" campaign.</P>
      <P>TSU Legislator Ho Min-hao said he hopes a "sovereignty
plebiscite" can be held on the day of the March 20 presidential
election next year to remind mainland China that its saber-rattling
against Taiwan will be to no avail.</P>
      <P>Noting that the United States is a beacon of democracy, Ho said
the Bush administration should support Taiwan's holding of a
"sovereignty plebiscite."</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION TO PROPOSE RESOLUTIONS ON STATUS QUO AND MAINLAND THREAT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucuses of the opposition
camp said on Thursday that they would propose that the Legislative
Yuan pass two resolutions concerning Taiwan's status quo and the
military threat of mainland China.</P>
      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) made the
announcement in an apparent attempt to block President Chen Shui-bian
initiating a planned "defensive referendum."</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, executive director of the KMT's central policy
department, said that the resolutions -- that the status quo will be
maintained of an independent, sovereign Republic of China, and that
mainland China should gradually withdraw its missiles targeting
Taiwan, will represent the common will of the people on the island.</P>
      <P>"They will represent a statement and declaration of Taiwan people
to the United States, mainland China and the Asia and Pacific
countries," Tseng said.</P>
      <P>He said that if the resolutions pass unanimously in the
Legislative Yuan, then President Chen will have no need to initiate a
"defensive referendum."</P>
      <P>But if the Legislative Yuan fails to pass the resolutions, then
the KMT and PFP will not rule out the possibility of the legislature
initiating a referendum.</P>
      <P>Chou Hsi-wei, the PFP's party whip in the legislature, said that
the legislature is the highest representative institution of the
people's will and every political party should support the
resolutions to be proposed by the KMT and the PFP, which he said will
"resolve the threat that the missile crisis poses to Taiwan's
political scene."</P>
      <P>Chou stressed that resolutions of the Legislative Yuan have the
same effect of galvanizing the will of the people in the same way as
a referendum, and mainland China's "response to the resolutions is
another matter."</P>
      <P>Chou also criticized the president's plan to initiate a
referendum to protect the nation's sovereignty and to urge Beijing to
withdraw its missiles targeting Taiwan as time and money consuming.</P>
      <P>Lee Chia-chin, KMT party whip in the legislature, said that the
resolutions are a way to express the voice of Taiwan people and a
way to protest against Beijing and ask it to address the missile
problem squarely, which he said is also helpful to restart the
stalled cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>The legislature passed a referendum bill last Thursday that was
largely based on the version of the opposition camp to set strict
restrictions on initiating a referendum, despite the fact that the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party had first advocated the
legislation.</P>
      <P>But article 17 of the referendum bill empowers the president to
initiate a referendum on national security issues in the event of
external threat. The threat which could trigger a defensive
referendum is tacitly seen as coming from the mainland.</P>
      <P>President Chen, addressing a rally in southern Taiwan last
Sunday, said Beijing's deployment of 496 missiles aimed at Taiwan is
sufficient reason for a "defensive referendum" to be called on the
day of the next presidential election on March 20, 2004.</P>
      <P>Chen's declaration has aroused serious concern that the move
might provoke Beijing, which has threatened to attack Taiwan should
the island move toward independence.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government should not overlook the
importance of holding multilateral trade talks with other countries
at a time when it is actively seeking to forge two-way free trade
agreements (FTA), an economist said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wu Rong-i, president of the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research, made the call at a seminar on the economic cooperation in
the Asia-Pacific region in post-Cancun talks era.</P>
      <P>Although countries around the world have shifted their attention
to create two-way FTAs following the collapse of the multilateral
trade talks held by the World Trade Organization (WTO) in
mid-September in Cancun, Mexico, Wu said Taiwan should still try to
work out a model under which it can conduct multilateral trade
negotiations and ink such trade pacts with friendly countries.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, forging a two-way trade accord is usually more
costly than signing a multilateral trade pact, and is particularly
unfair to poorer countries. At a time when anti-terrorism topics are
on the minds of the international community, a multilateral trade
accord will also help provide greater security for signing member
nations, he added.</P>
      <P>The Cancun meeting, a follow-up called by the WTO to discuss a
pact reached in the 2001 WTO conference in Doha, Qatar, broke up due
to sharp differences between rich and poor countries over the
Singapore issue -- market opening, regulatory affairs, improvement in
transparency in government procurement and simplified procedures for
cross-boarder transportation.</P>

      <P>A plenary session of the Legislative Yuan

that this is the first time that the school has accepted overseas

      <P>Law enforcement must not only work to
protect intellectual property rights by foiling pirates of software,
music and movies, but should turn their attention to the issue of
copyright infringement via the Internet, an anti-piracy group said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Members of the Taiwan Anti-Piracy Coalition, which is composed of
various groups around the island dedicated to protecting intellectual
property rights, made the appeal during a visit to the offices of the
police unit tasked with investigating IPR infringement cases.</P>
      <P>Coalition members were appreciative of the unit's overall results
but said that more needed to be done to stop illegal exchanges and
sales on the Internet.</P>
      <P>According to the National Police Administration, the police unit
mainly deals with major IPR infringement cases, especially upstream
manufacturers of pirated material and wholesale warehouses. The focus
of their work has been pirated audio and video discs. The coalition
said that the number of pirated discs available has declined over the
past year.</P>
      <P>However, they said that selling pirated material on the Net is on
the rise and cited a recent case where the coalition, working with
the police unit, uncovered Internet users who had been using P2P
technology to file share copyrighted software.</P>
      <P>The coalition members stressed that piracy not only involves
business interests, but creates social and economic problems. One
example, they pointed out, is that of the local film industry, which
has slumped due to the proliferation of pirated movies. Moreover,
gangsters have been turning to IPR crimes to fund their other illegal
activities, they said.</P>

a bloodless revolution in the Central Asian country late last month,
a senior official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a regular news conference, Victor C. Y. Tseng,
director-general of MOFA's West Asian Affairs Department, said Taiwan
hopes to develop new ties with Georgia in the wake of a transition of
power in the former Soviet republic.</P>
      <P>Former Georgia President Eduard Shevardnadze was forced to resign
Nov. 24 after weeks of opposition protests over a disputed
parliamentary election on Nov. 2. Shevardnadze, a former Soviet
foreign minister and a hero in the West when he helped oversee the
end of the Cold War -- handed power to Nino Burjanadze, speaker of
the Georgian parliament and one of the opposition leaders who
organized the protests.</P>
      <P>Noting that Georgia occupies an important strategic location in
the Kavkaz region, Tseng said MOFA will make every possible effort to
cultivate friendship and cooperative ties with the new Georgian
government.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tseng urged local people to cut non-essential visits

      <P>A spate of suicide blasts were reported in the Saudi Arabian
capital of Riyadh and the largest Turkish city of Istanbul in recent
weeks, causing heavy casualties and property damage.</P>
      <P>Quoting information provided by the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh, Tseng

      <P>The breakout of dysentery cases among Taiwan
tourists who visited Bali in November has had a noticeable impact on
outbound travel to the Indonesian resort island, a tourism industry
source said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wu Yen-hui, an official of the Taipei Association of Travel
Agents, said the outbreak of the disease last month among Taiwan
tourists has largely affected the business of domestic travel
agencies, prompting airplane ticket prices on regular flights from
Taipei to Bali to drop by more than 30 percent from the high season
level for the July-October period, which costed NT$12,000 (US$355)
for two persons on a round trip.</P>
      <P>Charter plane services arranged by travel agencies in southern
Taiwan have been more affected, with nearly 50 percent of the
customers booking for group package tours slated to depart for Bali
in December canceling their reservations, Wu said, adding that travel
agencies have not yet canceled the tours out of grave concern that it
will deal a further blow to the market.</P>
      <P>Wu predicted that the low ticket prices will remain until the
middle of January and that the price may rise for the following
winter and spring holiday seasons.</P>
      <P>A total of 99 Taiwan tourists who had traveled to Bali between
Nov. 7-22 have been confirmed as having contracted dysentery as of
Tuesday after returning home. The first case was reported Nov. 23.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mongolian Minister for Social Welfare and
Labor Shi Batbayar will visit Taiwan next week to attend an
international meeting and discuss issues regarding Taiwan's plan to
import Mongolian workers, an official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Victor C. Y. Tseng, director-general of the West Asian Affairs
Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) , said Batbayar
is scheduled to arrive in Taipei Monday to attend the 30th
Asia-Pacific regional conference of the International Council of
Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>Batbayar will deliver a speech on Mongolia's social welfare and
youth service programs at the Dec. 8-12 conference, Tseng said.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Taipei, Tseng said, Batbayar is also expected
to meet with Council of Labor Affairs Chairwoman Chen Chu to exchange
views on Taiwan's plan to import Mongolian workers. The ROC
government has decided to open its labor market to Mongolian citizens
in the near future.</P>
      <P>Officials from Taiwan's Department of Health recently inspected
the hospitals in Mongolia designated for giving health exams to
Mongolian laborers hoping to work in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition, Tseng said, Batbayar will pay a visit to the Eden
Social Welfare Foundation which will donate seven notebook computers
to the Mongolian Ministry for Social Welfare and Labor in support of
the Mongolian government's computerization program.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tseng went on, MOFA has invited four Mongolian
politicians -- M. Enkhsaikhan, Mongolian Democratic Party chairman;
former Finance Minister P. Tsagaan; J. Narantsatsralt, a member of
the parliament; and T. Sukhbaatar, director of the Democratic Party's
international affairs department -- to visit Taiwan Dec. 15-19 as
part of its efforts to boost substantiative relations between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties, Tseng said,
Taiwan-Mongolian exchanges and cooperation have been growing steadily
in recent years.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, Taiwan donated 7,000 tons of rice to poor families
in Mongolia. The rice was donated by the Council of Agriculture while
the World Vision Taiwan -- a non-profit private organization
dedicated to helping the underprivileged -- handled the costly task
of delivering the rice to Mongolia, Tseng said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has donated 7,000 tons of rice to
Mongolia to help the impoverished people of the country, an official
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Victor C.Y. Tseng, MOFA's director-general of the Department of
East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said that World Vision in Taiwan on
Wednesday delivered the rice, which was provided by the Council of
Agriculture.</P>
      <P>Tseng said that because of bad weather and the lack of needed
necessities in Mongolia, World Vision in Taiwan wanted to give
timely assistance.</P>
      <P>The delivery of rice is an expensive task since it must first be
shipped from Taipei to Tianjin, mainland China, and then to Ulaan
Baatar by rail.</P>
      <P>The shipment will be made in 4,000 new containers, or those that
have not delivered chemicals or pesticides before, and will be made
in 20 trips by train.</P>
      <P>Dagva Batmunkh, director of the Ulaan Baatar Trade and Economic
Representative Office in Taipei, said that the poor in Mongolia
account for one-third of the population and the rice is the best
Christmas present that the country could hope for.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Forty-three percent of the people responding
to an Executive Yuan-sponsored poll support the president's call for
a "preventive referendum" to be held concurrently with the
presidential election on March 20, 2004.</P>
      <P>The survey was carried out by the Research, Development and
Evaluation Commission under the Executive Yuan and was issued Friday.
It showed that 43 percent of the respondents favor the creation of a
new constitution via referendum by 2006.</P>
      <P>Thirty-nine percent said that several articles in the referendum
bill just passed by the legislature have unreasonably restricted
people's civil rights and the Executive Yuan should try to annul the
bill by asking the Legislative Yuan to reconsider it.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 58 percent believed that the Executive Yuan's new 10
major construction projects, which will cost the government NT$500
billion over five years, will accelerate the country's economic
development.</P>
      <P>Thirty-six percent of the respondents said "yes" when asked
whether it is reasonable for the referendum bill to forbid the
executive branch from initiating referendums, while 26 percent
disagreed.</P>
      <P>Thirty-one percent said it was reasonable for the referendum bill
to forbid the executive branch from organizing a referendum that
would have no binding force, known as an "advisory referendum," while
33 percent disapproved.</P>
      <P>Forty-five percent of those surveyed said it is reasonable to
have at least five percent of voters registered in the previous
presidential election, or about 770,000 signatures, for a referendum
to be held as provided in the bill, while 27 percent said this was an
unreasonably large figure.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by phone between Dec. 1 and Dec. 2 among
adults across Taiwan, collected 1,078 valid samples, with a margin of

    <HEADLINE>CONSUMER PRICE INDEX FALLS FOR NOVEMBER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 5 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's consumer price index (CPI) stood at
99.75 for November, down by 0.44 percent from the October level and a
0.45 percent fall as compared to the year-earlier level, the
Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) reported Friday.</P>
      <P>The average CPI for the first 11 months of this year declined by
0.29 percent from the level posted for the same period of last year,
and the CPI for the whole of 2003 is forecast to drop by 0.28 percent
as compared to the 2002 level, according to DGBAS tallies.</P>
      <P>The fall in the November CPI was a result of noticeable drops in
the prices of large production of winter vegetables, a DGBAS official
explained.</P>
      <P>The wholesale price index (WPI) for November reached 102.32, up
by 0.68 percent from the October level and up by 1.06 percent
year-on-year. The average for the period from January to November
increased by 2.52 percent as compared with the same period a year
ago.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS official attributed the growth in WPI to rising prices
of crude oil, and farm and steel products.</P>
      <P>The import price index last month rose by 4.19 percent as
compared to the previous-year level, if the prices are denominated in
local currency. The index would rise by 6.19 percent if the prices
were denominated in U. S. dollars. The New Taiwan dollar appreciated
by 1.91 percent against the greenback in November over its
year-earlier value.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP CHIEF QUESTIONED BY PROSECUTOR OVER ALLEGED EMBEZZLEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>People First Party (PFP) Chairman James
Soong was questioned by prosecutors Friday in connection with his
alleged embezzlement.</P>
      <P>The questioning, which began early in the morning at the
Prosecutors Office of the Taipei District Court, lasted until early
afternoon. Afterward, Soong left the Prosecutors Office and made no
comment other than to say he asked to argue before a prosecutor
against former President Lee Teng-hui, who offered damaging testimony
against him in the case. The prosecutor was non-committal to Soong's
request.</P>
      <P>Soong appeared at a news conference later in the day, claiming he
was set up by Lee, who Soong says asked him between 1990 and 1993 to
keep funds to finance the Kuomintang's (KMT) secret political work
when Lee's grip on power was not yet firm, and that Lee later denied
everything.</P>
      <P>He reiterated his argument that not a penny of the funds came
from the government, and not a penny of it was used to line his own
pockets.</P>
      <P>He claimed the case only strengthens his determination to
cooperate with KMT Chairman Lien Chan in the 2004 presidential
election to win power and push democratic and judicial reforms to
ensure that the judiciary will never again be used as a political
tool.</P>
      <P>The case stems from Soong's days as secretary-general of the KMT
from 1989 to 1993. He is accused of siphoning off NT$360 million
(US$10.55 million) from the party's coffers. The case did not come to
light until 1999, when Soong ran against KMT candidate Lien in a
three-way race for the presidency.</P>
      <P>The KMT filed a complaint with prosecutors against Soong Feb. 16,
2000 -- about one month before the presidential election day.</P>
      <P>Soong argued that the funds were entrusted to him by former
president and KMT chairman Lee for secret political missions, a claim
that has been denied by Lee, who served as party chairman from 1988
to 2000 and was Soong's political mentor until 1999, when the two
fell out over a political dispute.</P>
      <P>However, a prosecutor ruled against indicting Soong Feb. 20,
2001, when both Soong and Lien were defeated in the presidential
election by President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The KMT, led by Lien, decided not to pursue the case any longer
but a lawyer who was retained by the KMT to press charges against
Soong filed a motion on his own, forcing the prosecutor to reopen the
investigation.</P>
      <P>Lee, who fell out with the KMT in 2001, was displeased with the
KMT's attempts to close the book on the case and to reach out to
Soong, and was especially angry with Lien's decision to unite with
Soong against Chen in the March 20 presidential election next year.</P>
      <P>Lee gave testimony against Soong Oct. 22 this year.</P>

      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) proposed a resolution Friday
demanding mainland China dismantle all of its guided missiles
aimed at Taiwan as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The DPP-proposed resolution also urged mainland China to
gradually remove its other military installations in its southeastern

      <P>The DPP legislative caucus initiated the draft resolution after

Beijing's military threat on behalf of the 23 million Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Chen said he hopes lawmakers of the "pan-blue alliance" which

    <HEADLINE>MAC CONFIDENT OF SUCCESS IN CROSS-STRAIT CHARTER FLIGHT PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman
Chen Ming-tong said Friday he is confident that the plan for
cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights during the upcoming Chinese New
Year holiday can be implemented without problems.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a regular news conference, Chen said the MAC, which
charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China, has completed all
necessary preparations that Taiwan can do unilaterally for the
special holiday cross-strait charter flight plan.</P>
      <P>"We are now waiting for mainland China to take coordinated action
regarding its part of the plan, " Chen said, adding that he believes
the mainland will act in time to facilitate the return of Taiwan
businessmen operating in mainland China and their dependents for
Chinese New Year.</P>
      <P>In an unprecedented move, six Taiwan carriers were allowed to
operate charter flights between Shanghai and Taiwan via either Hong
Kong or Macau during the last Chinese New Year holiday early this
year.</P>
      <P>Zhang Mingqing, spokesman for mainland China's Taiwan Affairs
Office, said in Beijing Nov. 26 that the mainland is not opposed to
allowing a repeat of the charter flights, so long as the services are
offered in a "direct, two-way" mode on a reciprocal basis. Zhang
further said air carriers on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are
welcome to start talks on technical details of the charter flights.</P>
      <P>Chen said the MAC has decided to exercise more flexibility and
further expand the charter flight plan for the upcoming Chinese New
Year holiday.</P>
      <P>According to the MAC's blueprint, the flights can be operated
from Jan. 9 through Feb. 2, 2004. Chinese New Year's Day falls on
Jan. 22.</P>
      <P>The midpoints where the flights have to make a stopover will
include other designated third locations in addition to Hong Kong and
Macau. The departure and arrival points on the Taiwan side will
remain unchanged at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport and
Kaohsiung International Airport, while Beijing's Capital Airport will
be added to the mainland's departure and arrival points list.
Previously, only Shanghai's Pudong Airport was on the mainland list.</P>
      <P>Acting on the MAC's request, the Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) sent a message to its mainland Chinese counterpart Nov. 27
calling for consultations on the charter flight plan. The
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS) has so far not made any concrete response to the SEF's
appeal.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are quasi-official intermediary bodies
authorized to handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence of
official ties.</P>
      <P>The SEF said in its message to ARATS that Taiwan is willing to
allow mainland carriers to offer the charter flight services, but as
two-way services involve the exercise of public authority, including
security checks, the SEF said the two sides must meet to hammer out
mutually acceptable operational terms.</P>
      <P>At Friday's news conference, Chen said he hopes Beijing can take
active steps to begin negotiations to materialize the charter flight
plan as soon as possible.</P>

to put their weight behind his Cabinet's five-year, NT$500 billion
(US$14.7 billion) 10 new major public construction projects for the
benefit of future generations.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks after the conclusion of the general
interpellation in the Legislative Yuan that started Sept. 23.</P>
      <P>Yu said that he appreciated the views of the legislators during
the general interpellation and he added that in the case of those
questions that he had not already answered in detail, he will follow
up with written reports.</P>
      <P>He noted that confined by the rigid expenditure structure, the
government's investment in public construction has continued to
decline, resulting in a slow pace of growth and a loss of steam in
the push to build up momentum for the upgrading of the nation's
competitive edge.</P>
      <P>For this reason, he said, the Executive Yuan has unveiled its 10
new major public construction projects, which include the building of
a third freeway in central Taiwan, the nurturing of the top-notched
universities and research centers, and the expansion of Kaohsiung
Harbor to turn it into an intercontinental container center, to
invest in the nation's future.</P>
      <P>Despite criticism from some legislators, he claimed that the
nation "has no time for procrastination" and he urged the legislators
to look further ahead than the March presidential election and think
about the welfare of the nation so that the project can be put into
practice as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward

making mainland spouses the largest group of new immigrants to

      <P>Chen said the ROC government will continue its policy of "easing
restrictions on mainland spouses' daily lives while tightening
restrictions on their citizenship applications."</P>
      <P>"And the new radio program is part of our efforts to help
mainland Chinese spouses understand the government's stance and

      <P>The families of people who suffer a fatal

NT$2 million (US$58,823), a Department of Health (DOH) official said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Yen Jer-chieh, a section chief in charge of inoculation at the

deaths were reported after flu inoculation, with the latest case
involving Lin Cheng-kuo, president of the fishermen's association in

      <P>Yen noted that the DOH has set up a victim screening team, which
will review the application for compensation as well as the
verification of the cause of death.</P>
      <P>Those who want to apply for compensation should submit their
applications within three years of the inoculation, he said.</P>
      <P>According to DOH regulations, those who die as a result of flu
inoculation can demand up to NT$2 million in compensation, while
those who are disabled because of the shots can claim up to NT$1.5
million, and those who are made seriously ill because of the shots
will be provided with medical expenses up to NT$600,000.</P>
      <P>In addition, the families of victims who are given an autopsy

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN UNAFFECTED BY U.S. REMOVAL OF STEEL IMPORT TARIFFS: EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 4 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's steel industry remains unaffected
by Washington's decision to remove its steel import tariffs as its
steel exports to the United States are limited compared to its total
outbound shipments, a spokesman for an assets management company said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Wan-ta, general manager of ABN-AMRO Assets Management
Taiwan, said Taiwan's steel exports to the United States only account
for 5 percent, or some 300,000 tons, of the country's overall
outbound shipments and that the U.S. decision will have only limited
benefits for the domestic industry.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the China Steel Corporation -- Taiwan's
largest steel mill -- produces between 10 million tons and 12 million
tons each year.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that Taiwan's steel stocks are worthy of investment in
the long term because U.S. steel output might fall amid stronger
international competition. However, he added that this "indirect"
positive effect will not become apparent in the short term.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's steel stocks are good targets worthy of
investment for the time being, as operations and profits in the
domestic steel industry are forecast to continue growing next year as
a result of robust demand from mainland China. The earnings per share
of domestic steel stocks are relatively low at present.</P>
      <P>U. S. President George W. Bush scrapped the controversial steel
import tariffs, imposed in March 2002, to avert a possible trade

    <DATELINE>Tainan,  Dec. 5 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Scottish missionary James Maxwell, who is
revered as the original practitioner of Western medicine in Taiwan,
was commemorated again Friday with the publication of his biography
by a Tainan pastor.</P>
      <P>"The Life of Dr. James L. Maxwell, " a 400-page book with more
than 400 valuable photos and illustrations, was written by Rev.
Joshua Pan, an administrative officer in charge of pastoral care at
Sin Lau Hospital, established by Maxwell in 1865.</P>
      <P>According to Pan, Maxwell's travels took him all over southern
Taiwan during his nearly eight years in Taiwan until 1871, bringing
Western medicine to the local people as well as disseminating the
gospel.</P>
      <P>In addition to preaching and healing, Maxwell also taught in
"Pingpu" villages where aboriginal people lived, Pan said.</P>
      <P>Maxwell was also the first person to introduce print technology
to Taiwan, bringing in the country's first printing machine from
Edinburgh in 1880 to facilitate his teaching and preaching, Pan said.</P>
      <P>Maxwell's two sons -- John and James II -- both medical doctors,
stayed in the region far longer than their father. While John spent
more than four decades in mainland China, James junior spent 23 years
in Taiwan between 1900 and 1923 as president of Sin Lau Hospital,
according to Pan.</P>
      <P>A regional teaching hospital, Sin Lau now has 1,500 staff members
on its payroll and operates 800 beds in two major facilities in
Tainan City and Matou Township in Tainan County.</P>
      <P>Dr. Steen, an oncologist from the University of London and a
great-grandson of Maxwell, visited Tainan several months ago,
bringing with him a lock of his great-grandfather's hair which he
donated to Sin Lau as a token for the Tainan people, said Pan.</P>
      <P>Addressing the book launch, Deputy Tainan Mayor Hsu Yang-ming
lauded Maxwell as a great Western missionary whose significance to
southern Taiwan is fully as important as that of Canadian missionary
Dr. George Leslie Mackay to northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that there have been inadequate reports in Taiwan about
Maxwell and his sons, Hsu said Pan's new book is an invaluable
contribution to Taiwan's historical records.</P>
      <P>To commemorate the 138th founding anniversary of the hospital,
the Sin Lau authorities have had a statue of Maxwell built and they
have invited President Chen Shui-bian to officiate at an inaugural
ceremony slated for Dec. 8.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT FOC SHIPS TARGETED BY POLICE FOR SMUGGLING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 5 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan law enforcement forces are targeting
ships plying between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait under flags
of convenience (FOC) in a sweeping effort to crack down on the
smuggling of bootleg tobacco and drugs, sources from the Directorate
General of Customs (DGC) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Officials from the DGC Kaohsiung Customs Bureau said their
information has indicated that counterfeit cigarettes, mostly
originating from Tongxiao, Fujian Province, are likely to be shipped
via the cross-strait FOC ships to the southern Taiwan port of
Kaohsiung, either for transshipment or for sale in Taiwan as the New
Year holiday season approaches.</P>
      <P>Since the Kaohsiung Offshore Transportation Center was
established in 1997, many FOC vessels plying the Taiwan Strait have
been found to be a convenient channel for smugglers bringing in drugs
and counterfeit goods via Kaohsiung's transshipment facilities,
customs bureau officials said.</P>
      <P>Between 1998 and 2000, the "golden" years for smugglers, it was
not uncommon for customs officials to discover several different
smuggling cases aboard the same ship when making transshipment
anchorage at Kaohsiung, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Transshipment business has accounted for 60 percent of Kaohsiung
Harbor's overall operational business over the past 10 years.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Harbor is currently the sixth-largest container port in
the world in terms of the number of containers that it handles.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KINMEN COUNCILORS FILE LAWSUIT AGAINST COA OVER CATTLE BAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen, Dec. 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kinmen County Council Speaker Chuang
Liang-shih and other councilors filed a lawsuit Friday against a
Council of Agriculture (COA) official over a ban on the movement of
cattle from the island county to Taiwan proper that has been
in place for more than four years.</P>
      <P>The COA banned Kinmen cattle from Taiwan in June 1999 following
an outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) on the outlying island
that is suspected of having been introduced by cattle smuggled from
mainland China.</P>
      <P>After the slaughter of the cattle and vaccination of the
remaining stock, the FMD on Kinmen was contained, but the ban on
cattle exports to Taiwan proper has yet to lifted, resulting in
widespread complaints from cattle raisers.</P>
      <P>More than 30 people, including Chuang, Kinmen Farmers'
Association President Tsai Shui-yu, who is also a councilor, several
of his colleagues and cattle farmers, filed the suit against Chiang
Yi-nan, head of the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Inspection and
Quarantine, for dereliction of duty by banning cattle movements,
which they said has undermined the development of Kinmen and has
affected the lives of the farmers.</P>
      <P>The plaintiffs unfurled banners that read "We want to ship cattle
to Taiwan, " and "We want to live" in front of the Kinmen
Prosecutors' Office.</P>
      <P>Tsai said cattle farmers have worked with the government over the
past years to inoculate their herds, but because of the ban, have
been unable to sell more than 3,500 head. As the government has
failed to provide reimbursement, the farmers have no choice but to
file suit so that justice will be done.</P>
      <P>The farmers complained that the local market cannot accommodate
so many cattle without the Taiwan channel, which they said has
resulted in the price of cattle falling by 30 percent.</P>
      <P>Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng, who was on hand to give
moral support, also asked the central government to heed the voice of
the farmers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INTERVIEW MECHANISM DESIGNED TO PROTECT CROSS-STRAIT MARRIAGES: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The mechanism of interviewing mainland
Chinese spouses of Taiwan citizens upon their entry is designed to
protect legal marriages across the Taiwan Strait, Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Chen Ming-tong said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen said the interview system, which kicked off at the start of
September, is designed to protect those who follow the law and to
target those who attempt to enter Taiwan under false pretenses.</P>
      <P>The interview system is dealing a blow to those entering Taiwan
under the pretense of marriage to engage in the sex trade, as well as
helping clear the name of legitimate, decent mainland Chinese
spouses, Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to the Bureau of Immigration (BOI) under the Ministry
of the Interior, the number of arriving mainland Chinese spouses has
dropped 50 percent since the interview system was put in place Sept.
1.</P>
      <P>The interview system was introduced after a spate of bogus
marriage cases involving mainland Chinese citizens were uncovered.
Between Sept. 1-30, only selected mainland spouses were interviewed
to verify the legitimacy of their marriages.</P>
      <P>From Oct. 1, the system was expanded to cover all mainland
Chinese spouses making their first visit to Taiwan or to one of the
two ROC-held front line islands of Kinmen and Matsu, both of which
lie closer to the mainland than to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Starting Dec. 1, the system was further extended to cover all
arriving mainland Chinese spouses, including those who had visited
Taiwan before.</P>
      <P>BOI statistics showed that between Sept. 1 and Nov. 27, 3,918
mainland spouses were interviewed upon their arrival and that 470 of
them, or 12 percent, were immediately repatriated because it was
determined that they were in bogus marriages.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO SET UP AGENCY TO PROMOTE TAIWAN AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that
the government will establish an agency specifically aimed at helping
promote Taiwan's agricultural exports.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he attended an agricultural
products exhibition held at the Taipei World Trade Center square. The
exhibition was held by the China External Trade Development Council
at the commission of the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture.
Purchase officers from Japan also attended the exhibition.</P>
      <P>The president said that faced with pressure from international
trade liberalization and greater competition since Taiwan's entrance
into the World Trade Organization, Taiwan's agriculture sector not
only has to stand firm in Taiwan, it also has to take the initiative
to actively make inroads in overseas market.</P>
      <P>The government will form the agency to help promote Taiwan's
agriculture products to make Taiwan's agricultural exports No. 1 in
the world like the island's notebook computer exports, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Friday's exhibition is only the beginning, he said
similar exhibitions will be held in Kaohsiung Dec. 20, in Tainan Dec.
27, and in Hsinchu in January next year.</P>
      <P>The president said earlier in the day while receiving winners of
agricultural awards at the Presidential Office that "if Taiwan's
agriculture is to be viable, it will have to act like the island's
manufacturing industry by actively transforming and upgrading without
relying on government protection."</P>
      <P>He also said that an agriculture sector that enjoys a competitive
edge cannot rely on cheap prices alone but must also offer quality
products. He cited the example of imported Japanese rice which enjoys
brisk sales in Taiwan despite being several times more expensive than
locally-produced rice.</P>
      <P>The president stressed that "we don't have to be afraid of or
reject liberalization. After joining the World Trade Organization, we
have to open up the domestic market, but the world will also open up
to Taiwan."</P>
      <P>In the future, the government will promote agricultural products
with the same zest as it now shows in sponsoring information and
computer exhibitions, the president said.</P>

      <P>Authorities from the Thai Ministry of Labor
and Social Welfare have begun to straighten out the job brokerage
charge system which has been used for Taiwan-bound Thai laborers,
sources from the ministry said Friday.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the ministry wants the labor brokerage
firms to redo applications for licenses and that it has ruled that
the brokerage fee for each Thai worker heading to Taiwan should be no
higher than 5,600 baht (US$1,435) . Violators risk having their
licenses revoked, they added.</P>
      <P>Labor and Social Welfare Minister Uraiwan Thienthong said the
move is aimed at curbing the trend of overcharging that has been

said unregistered job brokerage companies or job brokerage firms that
charge brokerage fees higher than the allowed level will be forced to

Employment Brokerage in Thailand, said that currently, Taiwan-bound
Thai workers are charged up to 180,000 baht in brokerage fees, or
three times higher than the allowed amount.</P>
      <P>The new stricter policy will help ease the Thai workers'
financial burden, Prasit said, adding that brokerage firms will still
be able to earn between 10,000 baht and 15,000 baht for each worker
they send to Taiwan based on the new brokerage fee level.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN TELLS NY TIMES REFERENDUM NOT INVOLVING INDEPENDENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York,  Dec.  5 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian Friday told
reporters of the New York Times that he planned a referendum next
March calling on China to withdraw ballistic missiles aimed at Taiwan
and demanding that China renounce the use of force against the
island, and the planned referendum would not involve independence.</P>
      <P>The president gave an interview to New York Times reporters
Keith Bradsher and Joseph Kahn at the Presidential Office in Taipei
Friday morning. The interview and a report were carried on the
newspaper's Web site Friday.</P>
      <P>Following is a transcript of the interview.</P>
      <P>Q1. We appreciate your taking the time for this interview. We are
especially interested in whether you are committed to holding a
referendum on March 20. If so, what will be the subject?</P>
      <P>A: Before I answer the questions that you have just proposed, let</P>
      <P> me make some explanations beforehand. While the international</P>
      <P> community is highly affirmative of Taiwan's democratic</P>
      <P> achievements, I notice the international community only</P>
      <P> understands the democratic achievements that Taiwan currently</P>
      <P> enjoys but lacks a thorough understanding of the efforts that</P>
      <P> Taiwan has made and the difficulties that it faces today in</P>
      <P> its pursuit of democracy. Most people only see the lifting of</P>
      <P> martial law, the ban on political parties, restrictions on the</P>
      <P> publication of newspapers, and how Taiwan has proceeded along</P>
      <P> the road to democracy with the complete re-election of the</P>
      <P> legislature and the direct election of the president. However,</P>
      <P> most people do not understand the very difficult journey we</P>
      <P> had undertaken to have martial law lifted, to enjoy true</P>
      <P> multi-party politics, and to have one hundred percent freedom</P>
      <P> of the press and freedom of speech, to be able to hold regular</P>
      <P> legislative elections, and to have the head of state directly</P>
      <P> elected by the people. During the pursuit of democracy, the</P>
      <P> then-ruling party and administration opposed and resisted all</P>
      <P> kinds of demands for further reforms. Their main excuse and</P>
      <P> reason was that if we lifted martial law, if we lifted the ban</P>
      <P> on political parties or restrictions on newspaper publication,</P>
      <P> if we allowed complete re-election of the legislature, or if</P>
      <P> we allowed for direct presidential election, then China would</P>
      <P> attack us.</P>
      <P>In other words, in the old days, when the then-opposition or the
pioneers of democracy demanded democratic reforms, the administration
rejected their demands on the excuse or logic that the Chinese
communists would attack Taiwan. They used this counter-reform and
counter-democratic rhetoric, mainly based on the excuse that China
might attack us.</P>
      <P>The government or the governing party in the past saw democratic
reform as equivalent to Taiwan independence or as equivalent to the
insurgence of war. They saw the demands for democratization as equal
to the call for independence and that would cause China to attack
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the same light, today's opposition, which consists mainly of
the Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP) , which used to be
the ruling party of Taiwan, still put fear in the people by equating
referendums with Taiwan independence, and with war initiated by China
against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>To put it even more clearly, in the process of democratization,
the ruling regime of the past stand in the same line with the
People's Republic of China (PRC) in suppressing Taiwan's democratic
reforms.</P>
      <P>The PRC has over the long-term perceived Taiwan's internal
pursuit of further democratization as Taiwan independence, or
something that will lead to Taiwan independence. Therefore, they
would not renounce the use of force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Faced with such adversities, however, Taiwan's 23 million people
and the democratic movement have never been intimidated by the
military threat from the PRC. Nor have we been intimidated and held
back by the former ruling party's playing the China card and their
rhetoric that if we engaged in further democratization, that it would
hinder the stability of our society.</P>
      <P>Today, martial law has been lifted and there are no more
restrictions on political parties or the publication of newspapers.
We also have experienced the complete re-election of our legislature
and held direct presidential elections. However, those who had
resisted such changes, such trends, were the Kuomintang and the
People's Republic of China. Now the KMT has become the opposition,
while the PRC still exists and their military intimidation of Taiwan
has not decreased, nor have they changed their stance. We have,
however, completed our own internal democratic reforms.</P>
      <P>Over the last 50 years, the road to democracy cost the lives of
many people, freedoms were compromised, and families sacrificed their
happiness and well-being. This pursuit is ongoing, however, and we
have finally succeeded. Now the next stage for further
democratization lies in holding a referendum as well as the
introduction of a new constitution of Taiwan. We have confidence that
we will succeed eventually.</P>
      <P>The holding of a referendum is a milestone in our democratic
consolidation and the deepening of Taiwan's democracy. It has no
bearing on the so-called unification or independence issues. Nor will
holding of a referendum violate the pledges. We cannot accept
equating referendum with Taiwan independence. Referendum is a
universal basic human right. Equating it with Taiwan independence is
a serious distortion and insult to such a precious universal human
right. If referendum is equated with war, it would be a negation of
Taiwan's democratic achievements and a connivance with China's
military intimidation. Referendum, for me, is a strong belief that I
have held for more than 20 years and a long-standing goal and ideal
that we have worked hard to achieve.</P>
      <P>Many countries around the world are very familiar with the
exercise of referendums. Several countries have had referendums for
over a hundred years. Some have had it for several decades and some
have just recently held a referendum. Whether they be in communist
countries, less developed countries, or even less democratic
countries, the people have been able to enjoy the universal right or
birthright of referendum. Why should the 23 million people of Taiwan
be deprived of this fundamental right?</P>
      <P>In the past, when Taiwan was under authoritarian rule, the issue
of referendum was perceived as a political taboo or even an absolute
taboo. Yet in this democratic era, some groups and individuals create
innumerable obstacles and threats against referendums.</P>
      <P>Not long ago, the opposition still rejected the idea of holding
referendums. Now they have followed the position advocated by the DPP
and endorsed by me, to pass a Referendum Law, which marks a very
important historical moment in our process of democratization.</P>
      <P>To put it very candidly, however, the Referendum Law passed
recently is not entirely satisfactory, in fact, in our opinion,
several parts of it are unacceptable because they are somewhat absurd
and contradictory. Some parts are even against the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, the Referendum Law includes one very important
article, that is Article 17, which concerns "defensive referendums."
"Defensive referendums" exist to allow the deepening of Taiwan's
democracy as well as the safeguarding and defending of Taiwan's peace
and security. In order to deepen our democracy and in order to ensure
peace, we see it necessary to push forward with a "defensive
referendum." We intend to hold the first referendum in Taiwan's
history, a "defensive referendum, " on the same day as the election
for presidency, which is on the 20th of March next year.</P>
      <P>The reasons for this are several. Firstly, we must consolidate
the people's mental fortitude, build a nationwide defense network and
unite our people. Among Taiwan's 23 million people, there is a great
internal crisis. Quite a few people, however, obviously lack a clear
sense of crisis, and lack a clear sense of friend-and-foe. Taiwan
faces a serious threat from China. They have deployed 496 ballistic
missiles along the coastal areas with in 600km of Taiwan, and which
target Taiwan. Faced with such a crisis, such an imminent threat, how
can some people totally lack a sense of crisis and a sense of
hostility from the other side of the Strait.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I'd like to say that China's deployment of ballistic
missiles and military intimidation against Taiwan does not just
endanger Taiwan, but it also poses a serious threat to peace and
security for the whole Asia-Pacific region. I would, therefore, like
to take this opportunity to call for nations around the world, in
particular nations in the Asia-Pacific region, to seriously examine
the threat posed by China against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Our actions are not only taken for the deepening and defense of
Taiwan's hard-won democracy. Furthermore, we engage in such actions
in pursuit of the peace and security of the Asia-Pacific region as
well as for the world.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, the Beijing government has refused to sit down and
engage in a real dialogue with Taiwan's government, and they have
claimed again and again that they want to lay their hope in the
people of Taiwan. By holding a defensive referendum, Taiwan will show
to China the true voice of its people.</P>
      <P>We want to make Taiwan people's voice heard by the Beijing
authority and make them listen to the concerted outcry of 23 million
people that what we want is democracy, what we want is peace; we do
not want ballistic missiles and we do not want war.</P>
      <P>On March 20th next year, therefore, we will hold our first
historical referendum, and decide on what the issues listed on the
first referendum will be.</P>
      <P>The 23 million people of Taiwan will firmly demand that the
Peoples Republic of China immediately withdraw all the ballistic
missiles targeting Taiwan and also openly and publicly announce and
promise that they will not use force against Taiwan. If the Beijing
authority and leadership in China can respond with goodwill and agree
to immediately withdraw all the Ballistic missiles targeting Taiwan,
and openly announce that they will not use force against Taiwan, then
we will not be holding a defensive referendum.</P>
      <P>Q2: Given the recent rhetoric from Beijing, are we already in the
tensest period of cross-strait relations since 1996, and, if so, do
you think that this action on your part will increase those tensions
in a way that might upset the United States and other foreign
countries?</P>
      <P>A: The people of Taiwan want democracy and peace. They oppose
missiles and reject war. That this stance would cause some countries
to engage in military intimidation and belligerent rhetoric is
unimaginable.</P>
      <P>The Chinese government can oppose democracy and reforms. However,
they have absolutely no right to turn against the will and the
determination of the 23 million people of Taiwan in pursuit of
democracy and reforms. The United States is a great and democratic
country that respects the will of the people, loves democracy,
upholds freedom, and shows concern for human rights. I am confident
that the people and government of the United States will not oppose
the efforts of the 23 million people of Taiwan to enhance democracy
and ensure peace.</P>
      <P>Q3: Mr. President, you just mentioned that under certain
conditions you would consider not holding a defensive referendum. If
China did not respond with goodwill, what would be the actual wording
and content of a referendum should Taiwan hold one?</P>
      <P> A: The topic of the referendum as mentioned could be for the 23</P>
      <P> million people of Taiwan to demand that China immediately</P>
      <P> withdraw the missiles targeting Taiwan and openly renounce</P>
      <P> the use of force against Taiwan. Thus the topic of this kind</P>
      <P> of defensive referendum does not involve the issue of</P>
      <P> independence or unification, nor would it go against my "five</P>
      <P> noes" pledge. It represents the deepening of Taiwan's</P>
      <P> democracy and a guarantee of peace.</P>
      <P>Q4: When such referendums are held in the United States from time
to time, at the state level, rarely at the national level, we as
reporters often suspect that the politicians who are behind the
referendum really have their own reelection in mind, they're thinking
about their own longevity in office. Is there any reason we should
believe that this referendum is not connected with your own strategy
for the elections, that is, perhaps to increase voter turnout at the
election, to mobilize your own supporters in what looks to be a very
tight election coming up in March?</P>
      <P> A: First of all, I'd like to say that I'm already a president</P>
      <P> and it doesn't make a big difference to me whether I serve</P>
      <P> for one term or two terms. Secondly, a referendum represents</P>
      <P> a concept and belief that I have pursued throughout my</P>
      <P> more-than-20-year political career. It is a universal value</P>
      <P> and a basic human right. Moreover, I believe that it is also</P>
      <P> a dream long pursued by the 23 million people of Taiwan. As</P>
      <P> the leader of this country, it is my responsibility, my mission</P>
      <P> and duty to shoulder.</P>
      <P>As this referendum is called a defensive referendum, our primary
goal and purpose is to avoid war. Some argue that holding such a
defensive referendum might send our children to the front line. In
fact, the opposite is. By holding such a referendum, we will avoid
sending our children to war. We must prepare our defense in advance
to avoid war. This is also why we demand that the PRC (People's
Republic of China) immediately withdraw its missiles and openly
renounce the use of force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Q5: Have you received a letter or messenger in the last few days
from the National Security Council asking that you not take actions
that might disrupt the stability of the Taiwan Strait, in which the
United States has repeatedly expressed a strategic interest even
while saying democracy within the island is your affair?</P>
      <P> A: To safeguard peace across the Taiwan Strait and to ensure the</P>
      <P> security and stability of the Asia-Pacific region is Taiwan's</P>
      <P> responsibility. I also see it as my duty and responsibility.</P>
      <P> When I proposed the "five noes" pledge during my inaugural</P>
      <P> speech in the year 2000, I had a precondition: As long as the</P>
      <P> Chinese communist regime has no intention to use military</P>
      <P> force against Taiwan, I guarantee that I will uphold the</P>
      <P> "five noes" pledge during my term as president. Almost four</P>
      <P> years have passed, and I have kept my word. However, Beijing</P>
      <P> has continued to expand its military capabilities and</P>
      <P> increase its military budget. It has also heightened the</P>
      <P> threat of missiles deployed against Taiwan. Furthermore, the</P>
      <P> leaders in China have openly stated many times that they do</P>
      <P> not renounce the use of force against Taiwan. In 1962, the US</P>
      <P> faced the 13 alarming days of the Cuba Missile Crisis. With</P>
      <P> 496 ballistic missiles aimed at the 23 million people of</P>
      <P> Taiwan, every day for us is an alarming day.</P>
      <P>We are promoting a referendum and pushing for a new constitution.
There is nothing unusual about the United States government, as a
very good friend of Taiwan, expressing its concern. This is
understandable, and we appreciate it. Some people who oppose a
defensive referendum have made up stories or distorted the
significance of defensive referendum. They equate it to a referendum
on the issue of unification and independence. This is inconsistent
with reality, and does not represent our original intention. It is
not fair to us for it to be labeled a referendum on unification and
independence.</P>
      <P>I've already made it very clear that next year's March 20
defensive referendum should demand that the PRC withdraw all missiles
and openly renounce the use of force against Taiwan. I think that the
United States government understands very well that it would not be a
referendum on independence, nor would it go against the "five noes."
It is about the deepening of our democracy and the safeguarding of
peace. The US government should have no reason to oppose.</P>
      <P>Q6: Do you feel that you have the support and full understanding
of the White House on what you told us today about the purposes of
this referendum? Do you believe that the Bush administration
officials will understand and support what you're doing in the March
20 elections or do you fear that there are some in Washington who are
critical of doing anything that would upset cross-strait relations at
this time?</P>
      <P> A: Taiwan supports and would be happy to see the improved</P>
      <P> relations between the United States and China, as well as</P>
      <P> their cooperation on anti-terrorist actions and the problem</P>
      <P> of North Korea. However, we do not wish to see Taiwan's</P>
      <P> democracy sacrificed over these issues.</P>
      <P>We hope that the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, will not use his
upcoming visit to the United States to ask that Taiwan be suppressed
and sacrificed. As for China's intentions and the motivations of the
Beijing leadership, we would not be surprised, because they have
always done such things. However, the US government should be clear
that it cannot sacrifice Taiwan's democracy, or the further
consolidation and deepening of its democracy, in exchange for the
favor of Wen Jiabao or Beijing's leaders.</P>
      <P>The efforts of the people of Taiwan in deepening and
consolidating our democracy and ensuring peace should be lauded and
encouraged by both the people and government of the United States.
This deepening of democracy and safeguarding of peace are assets to
the United States, certainly not liabilities. The 23 million people
of Taiwan have a historic opportunity next March 20 to hold their
first referendum, a defensive referendum to avoid war by opposing the
deployment of missiles by the PRC and its intention to use force
against Taiwan. This should be a source of pride for the United
States.</P>
      <P>Therefore, some have even referred to the defensive referendum in
Article 17 of the Referendum Law as Taiwan's political TMD (theater
missile defense).</P>
      <P>Q7: I have a slightly sensitive question. Do you have a long term
plan in pursuing independence? Beijing seems to have assumed that
you'll attempt to declare independence while Beijing holds the 2008
Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>A: That's not how we would think about it. They have a great
imagination. Beijing will be holding the 2008 Olympic Games, and
we're very happy for them. We will be holding the Taiwan Expo in the
same year and have our own goals to which we are committed. We want
to maintain our competitive economic edge and ensure our niche in
economic development. We have seen that the PRC previously had four
constitutions. In other words, its constitution has been rewritten
four times. The 23 million people of Taiwan also want to have one
constitution that really belongs to them, one fundamental law of the
country. The current constitution, which was promulgated in 1947, is
definitely not suitable for or tailored to today's 23 million people.
It has too many problems, with more than two-thirds of it in need of
revision. We cannot repeat the same mistakes. We must make it more
suitable and viable. Therefore, we hope to do it through a national
referendum and the formulation of a new constitution. National
referendum is itself the spirit of making a constitution. We do not
want to play the meaningless word game of "constitutional amendment"
and "formulation of the constitution." I do not wish to go through
the parliament. From past experiences of going through the parliament
previously the National Assembly and now the Legislative Yuan, the
"high threshold" requiring the approval of three-fourths of the
members makes it impossible for revisions to be made for a good
constitution. We want Taiwan to become a truly complete, normal, and
great country. We want a constitution that I do not wish to be
custom-made for myself, for I will not be able to implement it while
in office. I hope that, after I am re-elected, I will succeed in
promoting a referendum on the formulation of a new constitution. This
new constitution will be born in 2006, and on May 20, 2008, when I
step down upon completion of my second term in office, the new
constitution will be implemented by the twelfth-term president. It
will not serve my own selfish interests or those of any political
party. It will be geared to the long-term governance and permanent
stability of the whole of Taiwan. Only then will it serve the genuine
consolidation and deepening of Taiwan's democracy. Therefore, the
year 2008 is just a coincidence of timing. It has never occurred to
us that when they hold the Olympic Games in 2008, we will hold the
Taiwan Expo. As to why the new constitution will be implemented in
2008, that just happens to be when I will complete my second term in
office. It is merely a coincidence.</P>
      <P>Q8: What's your opinion of the PRC leadership?</P>
      <P> A: We only have one wish, that on March 20th next year, when the</P>
      <P> people of Taiwan make their due decision and select me as the</P>
      <P> eleventh-term president of Taiwan, Hu Jintao and the leaders</P>
      <P> of China will respect and accept the decision made by the</P>
      <P> people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Q9: Do you consider this to be Taiwan's biggest crisis since
1996?</P>
      <P>A: I do not really think so. Much of it is being fanned up, and I
think that the root cause of the seemingly great tension across the
Strait actually comes from the reluctance of the Chinese leadership
in not wanting to see me re-elected.</P>
      <P>I think in the past the Beijing authorities said they would be
even-handed and not interfere with Taiwan's elections, so why are
they now making loud protests and creating such an issue? I think the
reason is very simple: that they now judge that I will be reelected
as the next president of Taiwan. I am certainly not their favorite
candidate for the presidency, just as former president Lee Teng-hui
was not in 1996. This is a case of history repeating itself. I want
to say very clearly to the Beijing authorities that the candidate you
dislike will, however, be re-elected as president.</P>

      <P>Liang said Tai, who will retire at the end of this year, invited
her to create the special Catholic church volume this summer.</P>
      <P>Tai was quoted as having told Liang that after many years of
service in the Vatican, he deeply feels that Oriental people lack
a deep understanding of the Catholic world.</P>
      <P>"He urged me to paint my feelings about Catholic churches as a
gift to the Pope who has been concerned about world peace," Liang
recalled.</P>
      <P>Braving scorching sun, Liang traveled around Italy this past
August to paint famous Catholic churches and monasteries in
rural areas. "It was an energy consuming task for me," Liang said.</P>
      <P>She visited 19 Catholic churches located in major
Italian cities. In addition to churches, her paintings also feature
images of Pope John Paul II receiving Catholic followers as well as
the Pope's security guards.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REFERENDUM AIMED AT URGING BEJING TO WITHDRAW MISSILES: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said in an
interview with the New York Times Friday that his administration's
plan to hold a referendum next March is aimed at urging mainland
China to withdraw its ballistic missiles targeting Taiwan and to
renounce the use of force against the island.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that a referendum represents a concept and belief
that he has pursued throughout his more-than-20-year political
career.</P>
      <P>"It is a universal value and a basic human right," Chen said,
adding that personal ambition is not a factor in his decision to hold
a referendum on the day of Taiwan's next presidential election on
March 20, 2004.</P>
      <P>"I'm already a president and it doesn't make a big difference to
me whether I serve for one term or two terms," he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's newly passed referendum law empowers the president to
initiate a referendum on national security issues in case of an
external threat. Chen said last Sunday Beijing's deployment of nearly
500 missiles aimed at Taiwan is sufficient reason for a "preventive
referendum" to be called on the day of the March 20 presidential
election. His declaration aroused concern that the move might provoke
Beijing, which has threatened to attack Taiwan should the island
declare independence.</P>
      <P>Chen said in the New York Times interview that the planned
referendum will focus on Beijing's missile deployment, not
independence. The referendum will help Taiwan people and other
countries around the world understand mainland China's ever growing
military threat, Chen said, adding that awareness of the threat will
contribute to alleviating risks of conflict.</P>
      <P>Chen further said his administration has informed the United
States of its referendum plan. Taiwan needs strong U.S. support for
its democratic development, he added.</P>
      <P>Reiterating that the planned referendum, the first of its kind in
Taiwan's history, Chen said it will mark a milestone in strengthening
and consolidating Taiwan's young democracy.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan once suffered from martial law rule. During that
era, he recalled, Taiwan's pro-democracy efforts always
encountered opposition from mainland China and the then-Kuomintang
administration.</P>
      <P>In related news development, the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party said Saturday President Chen will formally announce
guidelines for the referendum agenda at a Hakka people rally Sunday
in support of his re-election bid.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO IMMEDIATE DANGER OF CHANGE IN STATUS QUO: LIEN CHAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang's presidential
candidate Lien Chan said in a New York Times interview that Beijing's
deployment of missiles targeting Taiwan has posed a serious threat to
Taiwan's people, but he saw no immediate danger that Taiwan's status
will be changed right now.</P>
      <P>In the interview published Saturday, Lien stressed that the
nation's leader should have the wisdom and capability to deal with
the delicate cross-Taiwan Strait relations, as national defense
involves not just military power but also many other factors.</P>
      <P>Noting that the creation of peaceful and stable ties between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait is urgently important, Lien said their
"pan-blue alliance" has the ability to deal with the issue.</P>
      <P>Lien was responding to recent declaration by President Chen
Shui-bian that he would hold a "preventive referendum" on the day of
the March 20, 2004 presidential election, because Beijing's
deployment of 496 missiles targeting Taiwan already represents an
external threat allowing for such a referendum.</P>
      <P>A referendum law passed recently by the Legislative Yuan gives
the president the right to initiate a referendum on national security
issues in case of an external threat.</P>
      <P>Chen's movement has been construed by mainland China as a initial
step to move toward the independence, and has caused much concern
from the United States.</P>
      <P>Lien noted that U.S. policy on Taiwan is quite clear, that is it
will help defend Taiwan if the island does not provoke mainland
China. However, if cross-strait tension heightens due to the
provocation by Taiwan, the United States has no obligation to defend
the island, according to Lien. Lien said he agrees that the Bush
administration should further clarify the U.S. stance.</P>
      <P>With respect to the "pan-blue" camp's mainland policy, Lien
stressed that they will give priority in maintaining the status quo
across the Taiwan Strait, protect Taiwan's interests, and focus on
economic development.</P>
      <P>Lien said if he and his running mate, James Soong from the
opposition People First Party, win the 2004 presidential election,
they will try their best to resume the long-stalled cross-strait
talks, while keeping a military balance between both sides.</P>
      <P>If elected, Lien went on, they will continue purchasing arms from
the U.S., hoping that the American government will sell the weapons
that the island really needs.</P>
      <P>On economic issues, Lien said his "pan-blue" camp will present
immediately a four-year, NT$2 trillion (US$58.8 billion) public
construction budget plan which forms part of their medium and
long-term public construction program, once they are elected.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY TO BE CORNERSTONE OF NEW CONSTITUTION: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday his
administration's human rights policy initiatives are part of Taiwan's
preparations for writing a new constitution that fits the country's
realities and needs.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in a written congratulatory message
delivered at the opening of a two-day international conference on the
theories and history of human rights. Academia Historica President
Chang Yen-hsien read the message on Chen's behalf.</P>
      <P>In his message, Chen said, human rights protection prescribed in
Taiwan's existing Constitution is inadequate and incomplete in terms
of modern constitutional standards.</P>
      <P>Since assuming office, Chen said he has come up with many human
rights policy initiatives, including the establishment of a human
rights commission, the issuing of a national rights report annually,
and assessing the possible impact on human rights while formulating a
bill or policy.</P>
      <P>Chen said all these steps can be enshrined in the nation's new
constitution to upgrade human rights protection to the modern world
standards.</P>
      <P>In his 2000 inaugural speech, Chen recalled that he outlined
three key principles regarding his human rights policy -- pushing the
legislature to pass and ratify the International Bill of Rights as a
domestic law of Taiwan so that it becomes the "Taiwan Bill of
Rights"; setting up an independent national human rights commission
in line with the United Nations requirements; and bringing Taiwan
back into the international human rights system.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 10, 1948, Chen said, the United Nations passed the World
Human Rights Declaration and designated Dec. 10 as World Human
Rights Day. The Kaohsiung Incident -- a landmark event in Taiwan
people's pursuit of freedom and democracy -- happened on World Human
Rights Day in 1979.</P>
      <P>Taiwan took part in the formulation of an international human
right mechanism in the early stage and signed nearly 20 international
human rights conventions. However, Chen said, the previous ROC
government failed to substantiate human rights protection. After
Taiwan was forced out of the United Nations, it lost direct links
with world human rights development.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan's historic transition of power between different
political parties in May 2000 marked a new start in the nation's
human rights development.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years, Chen said his administration has
initiated a lot of measures and policies aimed at connecting the
nation's human rights protection with the international mechanism. As
his party fails to control a majority in the Legislative Yuan, Chen
said his administration has encountered setbacks and obstructions in
institutionalizing a world-class human rights protection system.</P>
      <P>Chen said the presentation to him of the 2003 Human Rights Award
by the International League for Human Rights marked the world
recognition of Taiwan people's efforts to boost human rights
development.</P>
      <P>For human rights protection, Chen went on, enhancing the public's
awareness of human rights concepts is as important as formulation of
policies and legal frameworks.</P>
      <P>"This is why I proposed the establishment of a national human
rights museum on the 2001 World Human Rights Day to facilitate public
human rights education and preservation of historical records of
Taiwan's human rights development, " Chen said, adding that he hopes
the opposition-controlled legislature can pass the organizational
bill for the planned museum as soon as possible.</P>

    <HEADLINE>IMPORTED FOWL, HORSES TO BE QUARANTINED AGAINST WEST NILE VIRUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Cases of West Nile virus have been reported
in various countries, so fowl and horses that are imported from
virus-affected areas must undergo a 14-day quarantine before they are
allowed entry into Taiwan, an official of the Council of Agriculture
(COA) announced Saturday.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Chung-yao, a section chief of the COA's Bureau of Animal
and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine, said that the
mosquito-transmitted disease will affect fowl, horses and human
beings and that the fatality rate for humans is between 3 percent and
15 percent, while birds and horses could also die after infection.</P>
      <P>Hsiao noted that West Nile virus cases have been reported in
America, the Middle East, West Asia, Central Asia and North America.
There were mass deaths of crows in New York in 1999 for unidentified
reasons, and it was later determined to be the West Nile virus. The
virus has reached 45 states in the United States so far. A total of
8,219 human cases have been reported so far, and 182 have died. There
have been 15,067 cases of the virus affecting birds and horses.</P>
      <P>He said that imported horses have to come from stables that have
had no West Nile virus cases for over six months, and that they have
to undergo a 14-day quarantine and test negative before they come to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>COA officials also urged the public to guard against mosquito
bites when going to the United States or Canada to avoid being
affected.</P>
      <P>To stem the West Nile virus from landing on Taiwan, the COA
bureau has since June 2002 commissioned the Veterinarian Department
of National Taiwan University to monitor imported fowl for the virus,
and so far have found none in 1,315 tested specimens.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAJOR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES RUNNING NECK AND NECK: DPP POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The results of a large presidential election
opinion poll shows that President Chen Shui-bian is running neck and
neck with his challenger from the opposition "pan-blue alliance," the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The DPP's public opinion survey center said it divided the island
into six areas for the poll and began to conduct telephone interviews
on randomly chosen adult citizens in one region per week starting
Oct. 22. A total of 16,804 valid replies were collected. The poll had
a margin of error of plus or minus 0.77 percent.</P>
      <P>Poll results show that Chen's support rating stood at 34.1
percent, while his key challenger, Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan had a support rate of 33.6 percent.</P>
      <P>Chen has yet to announce his choice of running mate while Lien
has decided to team up with People First Party (PFP) Chairman James
Soong to challenge Chen in the upcoming presidential election.</P>
      <P>"Chen's 0.5 percent lead fell within the margin of error,
indicating that the two sides are running at a dead heat, " said Chen
Chun-lin, director of the DPP's opinion survey center.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 41.3 percent of the respondents said they
prefer to see President Chen win a second term, compared to 38.9
percent who said they look forward to a transition of power in the
March 20 election.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 30.9 percent of those interviewed said their close
relatives and friends will support President Chen in the coming vote
while 29.3 percent said their next of kin and friends will vote for
the Lien-Soong ticket.</P>
      <P>The survey found that President Chen enjoyed a comfortable lead
in the southern Taiwan counties of Yunlin, Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung
and Pingtung as well as Kaohsiung City, while lagging in other cities
and counties.</P>
      <P>Chen Chun-lin said President Chen faces a tough, uphill battle in
the northern counties of Taoyuan, Hsinchu and Miaoli which have a
large Hakka population. Nevertheless, he said, Chen's support rate
among Hakka people around the island has risen significantly.</P>
      <P>Quoting the latest survey findings, Chen Chun-lin said President
Chen's support rating among Hakka voters was about 32 percent, 8
percent behind Lien-Soong's 40 percent.</P>
      <P>"Compared with the vote President Chen garnered in the
Hakka-dominate areas in the 2000 presidential election, his
popularity in the Hakka community has increased substantially, " he
added.</P>
      <P>By areas, the Chen-Lien support rate ratios were 30.7 percent vs.
45.5 percent in the Taoyuan-Hsinchu-Miaoli region; 32.4 percent vs.
31.1 percent in the Taichung-Changhua-Nantou constituency; 39.1
percent vs. 24.9 percent in the Yunlin-Chiayi-Tainan region; 39
percent vs. 30.3 percent in the Kaohsiung City-Kaohsiung
County-Pingtung area; 28.1 percent vs. 39.9 percent in the
Keelung-Ilan-Hualien-Taitung-Penghu area.</P>
      <P>In terms of age, Chen was less popular than Lien only in the
30-39 voter group, while leading or even in all other age groups.</P>
      <P>Chen Chun-lin further pointed out that President Chen's support
rating among independent or swing voters lagged Lien-Soong by 3.1
percent in a similar DPP survey in July, but the trend reversed in
the latest survey.</P>
      <P>"The latest poll found that President Chen led the Lien-Soong
ticket in popularity among swing voters by 6 percent, " Chen Chun-lin

    <HEADLINE>BILL SETS HIGH THRESHOLD FOR PEOPLE TO INITIATE REFERENDUM: EX-DPP HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ilan, Taiwan, Dec.  6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former chairman of the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Lin Yi-hsiung on Saturday continued to
criticize the referendum bill for setting too high a threshold for
the people to initiate a referendum.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks in Ilan, northeastern Taiwan, where he and
Ilan Magistrate Liu Shou-cheng, DPP legislators Chen Chin-teh and
Chang Chuan-tien and party officials distributed leaflets to
propagate their idea to scrap the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant through
referendum.</P>
      <P>Lin, who has long advocated holding a referendum on the fate of
the half-finished nuclear plant in Kungliao, Taipei County, said that
according to the referendum bill that cleared the Legislative Yuan
Nov. 27, the people will have to collect the signatures of 5 percent,
or more than 700,000 if based on the previous presidential election,
of the electorates in the latest presidential election, to initiate a
referendum.</P>
      <P>But he pointed out that compared with a presidential aspirant who
only needs the signatures of 200,000 to enter into a presidential
race, the referendum bill is "absurd" to place such a high
restriction on people's ability to initiation a referendum.</P>
      <P>The high threshold has ignored the "people's right to take part
in the formulation of public policy," he said.</P>
      <P>For this reason, Lin said that he will call on Lien Chan,
chairman of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Dec. 12. The KMT
orchestrated the passage of the referendum based largely on its own
version. Lin said he hopes Lien will orchestrate a correction of the
flaws in the bill.</P>
      <P>Under the referendum bill, the people, the Legislative Yuan and
the president all have the power to initiate a referendum, although
it only empowers the president to initiate a referendum when the
nation is under external threat. The external threat is tacitly seen
as referring to attacks from mainland China.</P>

In the ethnic conflicts that surrounded the collapse of the
Soviet Union, fighters in several countries seized upon an unlikely
new weapon: a small, thin rocket known as the Alazan. Originally
built for weather experiments, the Alazan was transformed into a
terror weapon, packed with explosives and lobbed into cities.
Military records show that at least 38 Alazan warheads were modified
to carry radioactive material, effectively creating the world's first
surface-to-surface dirty bomb.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Health authorities on the frontline island
of Kinmen on Sunday began to check the temperature of visitors by
using infra-red thermal imaging machines as part of efforts to
prevent a reemergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).</P>
      <P>From Sunday, the temperature of each passenger leaving Kinmen for
the Chinese mainland or entering Kinmen from the mainland will be
checked by the two infra-red thermal imaging machines installed at
Kinmen's Shuitou Port, the major gateway of the "mini three links, "
officials of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) Kinmen office said.</P>
      <P>The "mini three links, " initiated by Taiwan in January 2001,
refers to direct trade, postal and shipping links between the
ROC-held frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu and the mainland
Chinese port cities of Xiamen and Fuzhou in Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>CDC officials said that if an out-bound passenger is discovered
to have a temperature higher than 38 degrees Celsius, the health
authorities will advise the passenger not to board a vessel to the
mainland. If an in-bound passenger from Fujian is found to have a
temperature higher than 38 degrees Celsius, the passenger will be
given several surgical masks, as well as be required to take their
own temperature daily and report it by telephone to authorities for
at least 10 days.</P>
      <P>According to Chang Kuo-tu, director of the Kinmen Port
Department, the number of people using the "mini three links" channel
to travel across the Taiwan Strait is expected to pick up to the tune
of between 1,000 and 2,000 passengers per day leading up to and
during the Chinese New Year holiday period between Jan. 9 and Feb. 2,

      <P>Neither Kinmen nor Xiamen had reported any SARS cases during the

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CLAIMS HIS RE-ELECTION WILL PAVE WAY FOR MA IN 2008</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7 (CNA)
(By Mauro Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Sunday that
his re-election next year will pave the way for Taipei City Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou to run on the Kuomintang's (KMT's) ticket for the
presidential election in 2008.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening of the rebuilt Pingchiang Market in
Taipei City, the president reached out to supporters of Ma who were
also present at the ceremony, claiming that if he succeeds in winning
a second term in the March 2004 presidential election, then Ma will
almost certainly be the KMT's standard bearer in the 2008
presidential election.</P>
      <P>The KMT, in cooperation with the People First Party (PFP) , has
fielded a joint ticket for next year's election, with KMT Chairman
Lien Chan running for president and PFP Chairman James Soong running
for vice president. Ma has been tapped to be their campaign manager.</P>
      <P>It has been said that if Lien and Soong are elected in 2004, they
will likely bid for a second term in 2008 and therefore rob Ma of the
chance to run for the KMT that year.</P>
      <P>Chen , who lost to Ma in his bid for a second term as Taipei
mayor in 1998, thanked Ma tongue in cheek, saying that the defeat
forced him to run for the presidency in 2000.</P>
      <P>The president also pitched his calls for writing a new
constitution from scratch before 2008, using the rebuilding of
Pingchiang Market as a metaphor.</P>
      <P>He noted that the market was dilapidated and was listed as a
dangerous public building in 1994 when he was mayor despite it having
been reinforced several times by his predecessors. Chen pointed out
he decided to tear it down and rebuild it from scratch at a cost of
NT$3 billion (US$ 88.6 million), saying that thanks to his decision,
apossible disaster was avoided there when the island was struck by a
magnitude 7.3 earthquake Sept. 21, 1999.</P>
      <P>Likening the country's Constitution to a dilapidated building,
Chen said the Constitution is not suitable for Taiwan's rapid
democratization despite it being revised six times in the last
decade. "We need a brand new constitution, designed for Taiwan, " he
said.</P>
      <P>Ma didn't contradict the president during
the ceremony, but he told journalists afterward that he was surprised
Chen had turned a celebration for the opening of a new market into an
activity for his presidential campaign.</P>
      <P>Ma said he doesn't see any logic in the president's claim that
Chen's successful re-election bid will increase his own chances of
running for the presidency in 2008.</P>
      <P>He disagreed with Chen's view that the Constitution needs to be
replaced altogether, saying that altering the unfit sections of the
Constitution is more practical and cheaper in terms of the political
cost than creating a brand new constitution.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Sir John E. Sulston, co-winner of the 2002
Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine, is scheduled to come to Taiwan
this week for a lecture and book launching tour, sources from the
British Trade and Cultural Office (BTCO) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Sulston, former director of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute,
who led the British team on the international Human Genome Project,
is scheduled to deliver a speech titled "Society and the Human
Genome" on Dec. 13 at National Taiwan University, BTCO officials
said.</P>
      <P>Sulston's speech is part of the activities organized by the BTCO
to mark the 50th anniversary of the discovery of DNA.</P>
      <P>The Nobel laureate will also be present at a ceremony marking the
launch of the Chinese version of the book "The Common Thread: A Story
of Science, Politics, Ethics and the Human Genome" that Sulston and
writer Georgina Ferry co-authored.</P>
      <P>The human genome was successfully sequenced in one of the largest
international scientific projects ever undertaken. Now, societies
have to decide how that information will be used.</P>
      <P>In "The Common Thread, " Sulston and Ferry argue that the desire
for commercial profit must not be allowed to hamper future research
or to restrict the medical benefits of genetic discoveries to the
wealthy.</P>
      <P>The Nobel Assembly awarded the 2002 Nobel Prize in physiology or
medicine jointly to Sydney Brenner, Robert Horvitz and John Sulston
for their discoveries concerning "genetic regulation of organ
development and programmed cell death."</P>
      <P>The Nobel Assembly panel of judges said that by using the
nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system, the scientists had
identified key genes regulating these processes, and had also shown
that corresponding genes exist in higher species, including humans.</P>
      <P>Sir John, 60, graduated from Cambridge University in 1963. After
completing his doctorate on the chemical synthesis of DNA, he moved
to the United States to study probiotic chemistry (the origins of
life on earth). In 1969, he joined Sydney Brenner's group at the MRC
Laboratory of Molecular Biology and studied the biology and genetics
of the nematode worm C. elegans. He and his team collaborated with
Bob Waterston at Washington University to sequence the genome of this
model organism.</P>
      <P>In 1992, Sulston was appointed as the first director of the
Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridgeshire which made the
United Kingdom's contribution to the international Human Genome
Project. He was listed among Great Britain's 100 most powerful people
by the Observer newspaper. Sir John was knighted in 2001 for his
contributions in the field of genome research.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXECUTIVE YUAN TO ASK LEGISLATURE TO RECONSIDER REFERENDUM BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 8 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A political struggle between the executive
and legislative branches loomed Monday when the Executive Yuan
decided to ask the Legislative Yuan to reconsider part of
the referendum bill passed Nov. 27.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan spokesman Lin Chia-lung said that a Cabinet
meeting earlier in the day determined that 12 of the 64 articles in
the bill were unacceptable and would need to be returned to the
Legislative Yuan, probably on Friday, for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>Although the bill is a step forward in terms of the development
of democracy, Lin said, the Executive Yuan will do its part to fix
the flaws in the bill by annulling the 12 articles that unduly expand
the power of the Legislative Yuan by giving it the right to initiate
referendums on major government policy.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Lin went on, the bill runs against the general
practice of most democracies by stripping the executive branch of the
right to propose a referendum.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the formation of a referendum reviewing committee
called for in the bill is coincident with the existing Central
Election Commission in function, so there is no need for the
government set up another agency for the same purpose, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Once the request is submitted, the parts requiring
reconsideration will automatically be annulled unless the Legislative
Yuan rejects the request within 15 days with a majority vote of 113
in the 225-seat legislature.</P>
      <P>If that scenario takes place, the premier will have to either
accept the Legislative Yuan's decision or step down.</P>
      <P>Since the two main opposition parties control a narrow
legislative majority of 113 seats between them, every vote will count
in case of a showdown.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of foreigners who helped bring
democracy to Taiwan gathered in Taipei Monday to recall the days when
the island was ruled by an authoritarian government.</P>
      <P>In a conference organized by the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy,
the foreigners cited their own experiences in Taiwan prior to the
1987 lifting of the Emergency Decree and the end of martial law,
which allowed democracy to take root.</P>
      <P>Rev. Rowland Van Es, who was once deported by the Taipei
authorities as persona non grata, said he first arrived in Taiwan in
1960 and found that the people lacked trust in one another because of
the rule of martial law. This challenged his work as a clergyman
trained to listen to peoples' words from deep in their hearts.</P>
      <P>In order to avoid the attention of the omnipresent secret police,
Van Es said many private gatherings had to be held late at night
amidst a prevailing atmosphere of repression.</P>
      <P>Dr. Mark Thelin of the United States said he felt the pinch of
martial law when he first arrived in Taiwan in 1945 and the customs
authorities confiscated a book about communism. Although the book was
later returned to him, he said, this showed him that Taiwan was not a
free society.</P>
      <P>Thelin, who worked as a teacher at Tunghai University in Taichung
for many years before returning to the United States, said he was
glad to find democracy has now taken root in the country.</P>
      <P>Dr. Richard Kagan, also from America, said he was astounded by
the country's persecution of political criminals when he arrived in
Taiwan in 1960. His concerns over the government's treatment of these
people led him to visit the notorious prison on Green Island, where
the country's political prisoners were confined.</P>
      <P>Among the foreign visitors at the seminar are five Japanese who
expressed their long-time concern over Taiwan's human rights
situation during the conference. However, they made no comment when
Legislator Feng Ting-kuo urged them to help Taiwan's "comfort women,"
who were forced to serve as sex slaves for the Japanese military
during the Second World War, to get an apology from the Japanese
government.</P>
      <P>Michael Ying-mao Kau, vice minister of foreign affairs and
executive director of the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy, expressed
his thanks to the some 30 foreign visitors to the two-day conference,
saying that they helped push the country toward democracy.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian claimed Monday that
the domestic jobless rate will drop to 4 percent by 2005.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he spoke to more than 300
representatives of Chinese and herbal medicine manufacturers in the
Yungkang Industrial Zone in Tainan County.</P>
      <P>Chen also stressed the importance of his "Challenge 2008"
six-year national development plan and the recently unveiled
five-year, NT$500 billion "10 new public construction projects" plan.</P>
      <P>He said the government had originally envisioned that the budget
for research and development should account for 3 percent of the
gross national product by 2008, but added that it is now hoping to
achieve the goal by 2006 so as to strengthen the nation's competitive
edge.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the 2008 Olympic Games will be held in
Beijing, Chen also said that Taiwan will hold a science expo in that
year. He promised that although the venue has yet to be decided, the
Taiwan Science-based Industrial Park will definitely play host to
part of the expo.</P>
      <P>Chen earlier attended the unveiling of a statue of Scottish
missionary James Maxwell, who is described as the first practitioner
of Western medicine in southern Taiwan. He established the Sin Lau
Hospital in Tainan City in 1865.</P>
      <P>Chen said during the unveiling ceremony that as long as a person
is concerned about Taiwan, he will be remembered after more than 100
years by local people whether he comes from Scotland or Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, anyone who contributes to Taiwan is a part of
Taiwan society, irrespective of race. He further claimed that Taiwan
is open and receptive to many different cultures, which has also
enriched Taiwan's own culture.</P>
      <P>"Multiculturalism is Taiwan's most valuable asset and is not a
liability," the president said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INTERVIEWS ON MAINLAND SPOUSES EFFECTIVELY CHECK ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>

(photos available)</P>
      <P>Kinmen, Dec. 8 (CNA) Minister of the Interior Yu Cheng-hsien said
Monday that the interviews conducted on mainland Chinese upon their
arrival in Taiwan since Sept. 1 have effectively checked those
mainlanders who want to use a "marriage of convenience" to come to
Taiwan for illegal activities.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks when he visited Shuitou Wharf on the
frontline island of Kinmen to see the interview operations conducted
there on mainland Chinese spouses.</P>
      <P>Statistics released by the Bureau of Immigration show that as of
Dec. 4, a total of 3,945 mainland Chinese spouses were interviewed at
two international airports in northern and southern Taiwan. Out of
them, 543 were immediately repatriated because of their intention to
come to Taiwan for prostitution or other illegal activities. Among
1,182 who were asked for second-round interviews, 80 were
repatriated.</P>
      <P>During the same period, 205 mainland spouses were interviewed at
Shuitou Wharf in Kinmen and 24 were repatriated.</P>
      <P>Yu noted that since the start of the new system, 18 percent of
mainland Chinese spouses arriving at CKS and Hsiaokang international
airports were repatriated, and 10 percent were repatriated in Kinmen.</P>
      <P>The number of mainland Chinese spouses applying to come to Taiwan
has also dropped, Yu said, showing that the new system has
effectively checked mainlanders who want to come to Taiwan for
illegal activities under the cover of a bogus marriage.</P>
      <P>He also said that the crackdown on illegal mainland immigrants
aims to protect legal foreign and mainland Chinese spouses in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On a different note, Yu said that the policy regarding women
police officers will be reviewed regarding their numbers and their
working hours and duties.</P>
      <P>Yu said that more than 90 percent of those in Taiwan's detention
centers for mainland Chinese illegal immigrants are women, resulting
in a serious deficiency of women policemen.</P>
      <P>He noted that women policemen account for only 3.4 percent of the
police force and said that this is low when compared with the figure
of 4.3 percent in Japan and over 10 percent in Hong Kong. Most of
them work in the office, he noted, instead of going out in the field.</P>
      <P>Yu was accompanied by Bureau of Immigration Commissioner Tseng
Wen-chang to Kinmen. He also inspected a market where a great
multitude of mainland Chinese agricultural products are sold.</P>
      <P>Yu said that the agricultural products are indeed cheap, but they
are not quarantined and could be a health risk, and they could also
seriously affect the livelihood of the farmers in Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Yu said that he would take back what he saw on the island to
Taiwan for related government agencies to take action based on the
information.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REFERENDUM WILL NOT CHANGE CROSS-STRAIT STATUS QUO: MAC CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Dec. 8 (CNA)
(By Perry Hsieh and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan wants to push for a referendum, but
has no intention to use it to change the status quo in relations
across the Taiwan Strait, the Republic of China's top mainland China
policy planner said.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ing-wen, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) ,
made the remarks in an interview with Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a major
Japanese daily, which published the interview Monday.</P>
      <P>On President Chen's plan to hold a referendum on March 20, 2004,
Tsai stressed that the referendum has "no intention to change the
status quo that exists between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait."</P>
      <P>She elaborated that the U.S. is now preoccupied with sensitive
regions in the Middle East and North Korea, and Taiwan knows
perfectly clear that the U.S. does not want anything untoward to
happen in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>On whether Taiwan has solicited the views of others on the issue
of a referendum, Tsai said that it is possible to take stock of the
views of others, but the nation will have to make own judgment and
decision in the end.</P>
      <P>She said that interpretations on what constitutes major sensitive
issues vary, so Taiwan's referendum will need "correct understanding"
by related countries, implying the mainland and the U.S. In addition,
she said that Beijing does not want to resolve the Taiwan issue
through the U.S. and is hoping to do this by resuming cross-strait
negotiations.</P>
      <P>Asked whether one of the reasons for Taiwan authorities to
advocate holding a referendum also include the increasing aversion of
Taiwan people toward the mainland, Tsai said frankly that the
people's aversion about Beijing has been rising unabated.</P>
      <P>She said further that affected by Taiwan businessmen's investment
in the mainland, joblessness has worsened in Taiwan, and the public
also worries about Taiwan's increased investment in the mainland.</P>
      <P>She said that though Taiwan has handled cross-strait relations
with caution, it will be unable to stop the voice of the public in a
democratic society.</P>
      <P>On the principle role on cross-strait talks, Tsai said that the
Chinese Communist Party is the only government representative in
mainland China, while Taiwan has several political parties to
represent the will of the people, and will not be represented by only
one party.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that Taiwan has a semi-official organization to
serve as the principal negotiator with the mainland, but it will not
rule out the possibility of non-profit groups in the private sector
representing Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWANESE COMMUNITIES IN U.S. SEND CHINESE PREMIER PROTEST LETTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los Angeles,  Dec.  7 (CNA)
(By L.S. Chu and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Twenty-nine Taiwanese communities in
the United States jointly sent an open letter to mainland Chinese
Premier Wen Jiabao Sunday to urge the Chinese Communist regime to
respect the basic human rights of the people of Taiwan to pursue
democracy and freedom.</P>
      <P>The open letter, carried in all Chinese-language newspapers in
America, called for the mainland Chinese authorities to immediately
stop bullying Taiwan by threatening to use force for the purpose of
an eventual unification of the two sides, and immediately cease their
efforts to contain Taiwan in the international community.</P>
      <P>The letter told Wen that history is waiting to see if he makes
the right choice -- becoming China's Mikhail Gorbachev or China's
Saddam Hussein. "We wish you the ability to make a wise decision, "
the letter said.</P>
      <P>Wen arrived in New York Sunday for an official visit to the
United States. Tensions over Taiwan and U.S-mainland China bilateral
trade disputes are expected to top the agenda.</P>
      <P>The letter said that the "one country, two systems" unification
scheme is absolutely unacceptable to the Taiwan people since Taiwan
has democratic sovereignty. "The people of Taiwan enjoy democracy,
freedom and economic prosperity, which have been earned by the Taiwan
people with their own sweat and blood over the past 50 years, " it
said.</P>
      <P>It stressed that the people of Taiwan did not derive the
sovereignty of the nation from any other country and that Taiwan will
never "lower its status" voluntarily to become a "special district"
of any other country.</P>
      <P>It also refuted Wen's public remarks several days ago accusing
Taiwan's leadership of attempting to use a democratic practice such
as a referendum as a cover to split from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Holding a referendum in Taiwan is a move that will put popular
democracy into practice, and Taiwan's success in this regard will in
turn serve as an inspiration for mainland China to emulate, the
letter said.</P>
      <P>Referendums in Taiwan are an internal affair to which no other
country should interfere, it said, adding that Taiwan is a
peace-loving country and China's military threats are the core reason
behind the tensions across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Members of the 29 Taiwanese groups that signed the open letter to
Wen included the Formosan Association of Public Affairs, the
Taiwanese Association of America, The Taiwanese Human Rights
Association of America, the L.A. Chapter of the Global Alliance for
Democracy and Peace and several other Taiwanese volunteers
organizations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HAS TAKEN PART IN INTERNATIONAL ANTI-TERRORISM EFFORTS: MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.   8   (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Transportation and
Communications Lin Ling-san said Monday that Taiwan has participated
in international anti-terrorism efforts.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks when he addressed the opening of the two-day
International Symposium on Aviation and Maritime Security in Taipei,
which is sponsored by National Chiao Tung University.</P>
      <P>Lin said that in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks
against the United States, no countries or people can ignore the
threat of terrorism and the trend of the world to be aware of
anti-terrorism efforts.</P>
      <P>Every government has the responsibility to take substantial
measures to protect transport security and prevent terrorist
activities from taking place, he said.</P>
      <P>As a member of the international community, Taiwan adamantly
support all forms of international anti-terrorism cooperation, Lin
stressed.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan had engaged in anti-terrorism cooperation through
bilateral channels, and has actively responded and is ready to fight
terrorism, " he said, citing the container security initiative
promoted by the U.S. government as an example.</P>
      <P>Lin said that Taiwan is a key transport center in southeast Asia
and northeast Asia, with over 1,000 flights of civilian airplanes
passing over the Taipei flight information region and 500 ships from
various countries navigating the Taiwan Strait every day. Therefore,
security is a big issue not to be ignored, he added.</P>
      <P>But Lin also said that he regretted that Taiwan is not able to
participate in the International Civil Aviation Organization and the
International Maritime Organization. This creates a missing link in
the global sea and aviation security system.</P>
      <P>The organizations are under the United Nations, which precludes
Taiwan's participation.</P>
      <P>Lin also cited evidence to show that Taiwan supports efforts on
anti-terrorism to protect shipping security, saying that his ministry
has adopted the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code
(ISPS Code) to monitor all port authorities working out security
plans for port facilities, while shipping companies have also acted
according to the law to handle commercial shipping and international
business port facility security.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, U.S. Representative Dan Burton (R-IN), speaking at the
same forum, said that he supports Taiwan's fight against the threat
of a missile attack from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Burton said that the threat of terrorism is without borders and a
problem that the world has to face. He said that all countries have
to cooperate to fight against terrorism.</P>
      <P>Burton also mentioned Taiwan's planned referendum under the
missile threat from the mainland, believing that when freedom is
threatened, Taiwan people have to say loudly to the mainland that
Taiwan needs freedom, security and peace.</P>
      <P>As an international friend of Taiwan, Burton said that he
supported Taiwan's people to fight against the threat of the missiles
on the mainland.</P>
      <P>The symposium brought together 200 figures from government,
academia, and industry in Taiwan as well as scholars and experts
from 16 countries to deliver papers and take part in seminars.</P>
      <P>This was Taiwan's first major conference on transportation
safety in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INVENTEC CO-FOUNDER DIES AT 55</HEADLINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>

By Deborah Kuo
CNA reporter</P>
      <P>Taipei, Dec. 8 (CNA) Sayling Wen, one of Taiwan's first
calculator makers who went on to become a pioneer of the island's
information technology industry, died of cerebral hemorrhage Dec. 7.
He was 55.</P>
      <P>Wen, who became president of calculator manufacturer Santron at
the age of 24, went into coma three days ago due to a hemorrhagic
stroke and was rushed to hospital. He never awoke from the coma.</P>
      <P>His sudden passing left his old pals from Santron and the
thousands of staff members of Inventec Group, one of the major
notebook and IT device manufacturers in Taiwan, caught unprepared.</P>
      <P>Wen and his National Taiwan University classmate Barry Lam, now
chairman of Quanta Computer, and Chiang Ying-tsun, former chairman of
GVC Electronics, co-founded Santron Electronics in 1972 to churn out
electronic devices and Taiwan's first-generation electronic
calculators.</P>
      <P>In 1973, at the age of 25, he and Lam and some other IT
enthusiasts jointly established Kinpo Electronics to expand
manufacturing of calculators as well as to research and develop
simple computers.</P>
      <P>In 1975, Wen and classmate Yeh Kuo-yi co-founded Inventec Group
to make computer peripherals and related products. The founding of
these companies paved the way for Taiwan's transition into a global
hardware manufacturing powerhouse.</P>
      <P>By the age of 26, Wen had traveled to 43 countries, most of the
time traveling with a suitcase containing calculators and other
innovative electronic devices. By the age of 40, he had traveled to
70 countries around the world, with about 300 days out of every year
being spent in either hotels or aboard airplanes.</P>
      <P>At 50, Wen retired from the electronics business, as he had
planned, and became a writer and a philanthropist.</P>
      <P>In 2000, he found himself in the rural township of Huangyangchuan
in Gansu Province, one of the poorest areas in mainland China. He
said at the time that viewing the local residents there living in
grinding poverty brought him to the verge of tears.</P>
      <P>He spent the entire year of 2002 traveling around 12 provinces in
western, southern and northern China, trying to figure out the best
ways to help the poor Chinese people.</P>
      <P>In 2002, he set up the Qian-Xiang-Wan-Cai Co. in Huangyangchuan,
aimed at establishing a computerized network, at a cost of US$50
million, in western China as a fast track on which the locals'
livelihood could be improved.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he invested US$5 million to build a five-star,
150-room hotel-like conference center in Huangyangchuan, claiming
that the hotel would serve as a home away from home for business
people. "Only by attracting the rich to the poor area will it be
freed from poverty," he said at the time.</P>
      <P>Wen was also planning to establish a software development company
in Huangyangchuan, aimed at turning the backwater into a high-tech
hub in western China.</P>
      <P>By early 2003, Wen was the talk of the town in western China.</P>
      <P>A philanthropist, Wen himself led the simplest life that he
possibly could. Being a little bit plump, Wen stopped eating anything
after 3 p.m. every day and only drank diet cola after that hour.</P>
      <P>Despite the wealth he accumulated over the past three decades,
Wen once said that only the richness of life derived from his
experiences over the years was his real fortune.</P>
      <P>Wen had his first book published at the age of 49 when he and his
friends, including renowned cartoonist Tsai Chih-chung, co-founded
the Studio for Tomorrow. In the following six years, he authored 20
books on business management and philosophy, English learning, the
development potential of western China, and others.</P>
      <P>In fact, according to Tsai, Wen's greatest ambition was to become
a novelist writing exclusively Chinese kung fu novels. Wen began to
write kung fu novels as a ghost writer in high school to earn money
to help his mother make ends meet, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Tsai used the Chinese word "kuan, " which can mean either "wide"
or "magnanimous, " to describe Wen. He said Wen had a wide body and
was a "wide-minded" man who always demonstrated magnanimity toward
his family and friends.</P>
      <P>Wen was impartial politically, giving support to any party that
he considered was doing a good thing for the people and the country.
He once gave the Democratic Progressive Party NT$500,000 in cash to
help out the then opposition party during its most difficult years.</P>
      <P>More recently, he was scheduled to attend a ceremony marking the
establishment of the national presidential campaign headquarters of
the "pan-blue alliance" ticket of Lien Chan and James Soong slated
for Dec. 7 to drum up support for the major opposition camp. He never
made it.</P>
      <P>Since his psychological retirement at the age of 50, Wen spent a
lot of his time chatting with the younger generations online via his
Studio for Tomorrow, besides traveling to mainland China to carry out
his philanthropic work.</P>
      <P>He once said that the one thing that made him feel most
comfortable was that he had a good wife and a filial son.</P>
      <P>He left numerous "quotable quotes" in his online chats, such as:
"The computer is my office, " "Working is a duty as well as a joy, "
and "Flying is a time for writing and sleeping."</P>
      <P>He also wrote during one of his online chats that: "Busy is
staying for only one day at one hotel and not having time to have
your clothes washed." "Leisure is staying at the same hotel for three
days or more."</P>

    <HEADLINE>ARAB SECURITY PROFESSIONALS RECEIVING FORENSICS TRAINING IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Arab security professionals began
to receive forensics training in Taiwan Tuesday under a cooperation
program between Taiwan and Saudi Arabia, sources from the Ministry of
Justice Investigation Bureau (MOJIB) said.</P>
      <P>Eight trainees from the Riyadh-based Naif Arab Academy for
Security Sciences will be receiving intensive training on DNA
forensics over the next two weeks at the MOJIB headquarters in
Taipei, said Pu Chang-en, a section chief of the MOJIB Sixth
Department.</P>
      <P>According to Pu, the Naif Arab Academy for Security Sciences was
established to fulfill the needs expressed by Arab law enforcement
agencies for an academic institution that would promote research on
security issues, offer postgraduate programs, and conduct short-term
training courses that could contribute to the prevention and control
of crime in the 22 Arab countries, most of which are located in the
Middle East.</P>
      <P>The Naif Arab Academy for Security Sciences has been engaged in
academic cooperation with Taiwan's MOJIB since 1995, regularly
sending its trainees, most of them police and intelligence personnel,
to Taiwan to receive professional training and inviting MOJIB experts
to Riyadh to give lectures to the Arab trainees, Pu said.</P>
      <P>More than 100 Naif trainees have received training in chemical
forensics in previous sessions held at the MOJIB, according to Pu.</P>
      <P>The eight Naif trainees who are attending this current training
session are mainly police and intelligence professionals from Bahrain
and Saudi Arabia, Pu said.</P>
      <P>He added that as it has become increasingly difficult for Taiwan
to expand its diplomacy worldwide due to the difficult international
situation, the MOJIB'S cooperation with foreign academic institutions
has opened up another door for Taiwan's diplomatic development.</P>
      <P>In addition to cooperating with the Arab world, the MOJIB has
also cooperated with Japan and the United States, collaborating in
chemical analysis of amphetamines, heroin and other illicit drugs,
and in tracing the sources of these illicit drugs, Pu said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has been ranked 17th globally in
terms of networked readiness index (NRI) by the Switzerland-based
World Economic Forum, according to the global information technology
report 2003-2004 posted on its Web site Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Covering a total of 102 economies around the world, the report
said that the NRI is composed of three component indices that asses
the environment for information and communication technology (ICT)
offered by a given country or community, the readiness of the
community's key stakeholders (individuals, businesses and
governments) and the usage of ICT among these stakeholders.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reiterated his
determination Tuesday to hold an unprecedented national referendum on
March 20, despite news from Washington that the United States
disapproves of such a move.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a concert to mark International Human Rights Day, the
president said his plan for a "preventive referendum" on Beijing's
missile threat to Taiwan will not be changed.</P>
      <P>Although Chen did not mentioned the United States by name, his
remarks were considered a response to an anonymous U.S. official's
warning in Washington earlier in the day that the United States sees
no logical purpose in the referendum except that it could anger
Beijing and destabilize the situation across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>One of Chen's aides turned down journalists' requests to comment
on the U.S. official's remarks earlier in the day, saying that his
office would not comment on stories attributed to anonymous sources.</P>
      <P>However, the aide said there is no difference in the position of
Taipei and Washington over the referendum issue. Washington opposes
any referendum that would push the envelope and Chen has said he will
not contradict his inaugural promise not to toy with the idea of
Taiwan independence during his term via referendum, the aide said,
adding that these positions have not changed.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian traveled to the
eastern county of Hualien Tuesday to decorate Buddhist Master Cheng
Yen for her outstanding contributions to charity and humanitarian
relief at home and abroad over the past 37 years.</P>
      <P>Chen conferred upon Cheng Yen the Order of Brilliant Star at a
ceremony held at the Tzu Chi Meditation Center in Hualien, with Vice
President Annette Lu, several other government officials and some Tzu
Chi volunteers witnessing.</P>
      <P>Chen lauded Cheng Yen for founding the Buddhist Compassionate
Relief Tzu Chi Foundation to carry out four major missions --
charity, medicine, education and culture at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>Under Cheng Yen's leadership, Chen said, Tzu Chi has become an
"empire of charity" and has achieved "brilliant accomplishments" that
few other organizations can emulate.</P>
      <P>"Tzu Chi has conveyed Taiwan's vitality and love to the world
through its selfless, dedicated charitable and humanitarian services
over the years, " Chen said at the ceremony. "I admire Cheng Yen as
she has entered society to help people."</P>
      <P>Cheng Yen was nominated in 1996 for the Nobel Peace Prize for her
selfless dedication to helping others and for bringing to a troubled
world a renewed vision of compassion in action.</P>
      <P>In the July 2000 issue of the U.S. magazine BusinessWeek, Cheng
Yen was named as one of the 50 "Stars of Asia" -- leaders at the
forefront of change. After more than 30 years of total devotion to
disaster relief and charitable works in Taiwan and dozens of other
countries, the magazine says, Cheng Yen has gained international
prominence as the "Mother Teresa of the Buddhist World."</P>
      <P>Tzu Chi now boasts 4 million members in Taiwan alone -- about
one-fifth of the country's population -- and takes in a large amount
of donations annually to finance disaster relief operations
throughout the world, as well as building hospitals, colleges and
research centers.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  8 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Eleven members of the U.S. House of
Representatives sent a joint letter to President George W. Bush
Monday urging him to reaffirm U.S. support for Taiwan's democratic
development and the right of the Taiwan people to decide on their
nation's future.</P>
      <P>The letter was sent to the White House on the eve of Bush's
meeting with mainland Chinese Premiere Wen Jiabao, who arrived in New
York Sunday on his first official visit to the United States since
taking office.</P>
      <P>The congressmen said in the letter that the United States should
not compromise with any other country on democratic activities in
Taiwan or other parts of the world while American soldiers are
fighting for freedom and democracy in Iraq and Afghanistan.</P>
      <P>They expressed their common hope that Bush will reaffirm the
long term U.S. support for Taiwan's democratic development during his
talks with Wen. Support for democracy, human rights and rule of law
has been U.S. policy, which also epitomizes America's core values,
the lawmakers said.</P>
      <P>They also urged Bush to reaffirm to Wen U.S. support for free and
fair elections in Taiwan and its stance that the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait should resolve the issue of Taiwan's status through
peaceful and democratic means.</P>
      <P>The congressmen included David Wu (D-Oregon) , Steve Chabor
(R-Ohio) and Robert Menendez (D-New Jersey).</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the four co-chairmen of the U.S. Taiwan Caucus, a
pro-Taiwan group in the House, also sent a joint letter to Secretary
of State Colin Powell urging him and Bush not to declare
U.S. opposition to Taiwan independence during their talks with Wen.</P>
      <P>The four co-chairmen are Rep. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Rep. Steve
Chabot (R-Ohio) , Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) and Rep. Robert
Wexler (D-Fla.).</P>
      <P>They reminded Powell in their joint letter that it would mark an
actual change to long-term U.S. policy toward Taiwan if Bush publicly
announces U.S. opposition to Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>One of the Six Assurances the United States pledged to Taiwan in
1982 was that the United States will not change its stance on
Taiwan's sovereignty issue, the four co-chairmen said, adding that
they hope Powell and Bush will reaffirm U.S. security commitments to
Taiwan during their meetings with Wen.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  9 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan exports to Hong Kong and mainland
China hit a new high of US$5.072 billion in November, accounting for
36.69 percent of the country's overall outbound shipments, according
to the latest statistics compiled by the Ministry of Finance.</P>
      <P>The record high figure made the Greater China area Taiwan's No. 1
export outlet, with the United States and the European Union ranking
in second and third spots, absorbing 16 percent and 15.5 percent of
Taiwan's exports valued at US$2.21 billion and US$2.14 billion,
respectively, last month.</P>
      <P>Greater China began to replace the United States as Taiwan's top
export market in 2000, with the ratio as a percentage of Taiwan's
overall outbound shipments rising from 23.97 percent in 2000 to 25.81
percent in 2001 and 31.23 percent in 2002, ministry statistics show.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Taiwan exported US$1.365 billion-worth of goods
and services, or about 10 percent of the total, to various member
states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in November,
while its exports to Japan dropped to 8.34 percent of the total.</P>
      <P>Taiwan enjoyed a trade surplus of US$3.74 billion and US$700
million with the Greater China area and the United States in
November, up by US$810 million and down by US$260 million compared to
the year-earlier levels, respectively. The country also posted a
trade gap of US$720 million in its favor with the European Union, up
by US$130 million.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan suffered a trade deficit of US$2.34 billion with
Japan, an increase of US$1.08 billion year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan exports set a record single-month high of
US$13.8 billion for November, customs tallies show. The figure
represents a 16.2 percent growth rate year-on-year, which is also the
eighth monthly rise in a row.</P>
      <P>Taiwan outbound shipments are expected to register another high
for December with a double-digit increase, which is forecast to give
an export increase rate of 9.8 precent for the whole of 2003, a
ministry official said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWS REVISED TO SHELTER BROADCAST STATIONS FROM POLITICAL INFLUENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  9 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A set of three revised laws aimed at
sheltering the broadcast media from political influence passed a
third reading at the Legislative Yuan Tuesday after years of fierce
bickering among the lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Under the revised rules of the Broadcast &amp; Television Law, Cable
Television Law and the Satellite Television Law, the government and
political parties are forbidden to invest in or run radio and
television stations.</P>
      <P>The government and political parties which owned stakes in these
stations before the laws were revised must divest themselves within
two years of the revised rules taking force.</P>
      <P>The revised laws also forbid elected public officials, officials
of government and political party officials from serving as
directors, supervisors or managers of broadcast stations.</P>
      <P>Those who already served in these posts before the laws were
revised will have to quit within six months of the revisions taking
effect.</P>
      <P>As a consequence, the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will have to
divest itself of its stakes in the Broadcast Company of China (BCC)
and the China Television Company (CTV) within two years, while the
Executive Yuan will have to sell its stakes in the Taiwan Television
Enterprise Ltd. (TTV) and the China Television System (CTS).</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan will have to come up a plan within six months
to dispose of its stakes in the two television companies. There has
been speculation that the government intends to turn CTS into a
foundation while selling its TTV shares to private investors.</P>
      <P>In order to prevent the government and political parties from
getting around the ban via front organizations, the prohibition will
also apply to foundations set up with donations from government or
political parties or their attorneys.</P>
      <P>The revised rules also prohibit candidates for public office from
appearing in television and radio programs, commercials or short
films made with government funds.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Hong Hsiu-chu of the KMT, who initiated the ban, calls
this article "President Chen's clause" since it was crafted to stop
President Chen Shui-bian from airing his weekly televised talk at the
cost of the taxpayers once he attains his candidacy in the March
presidential election.</P>
      <P>In order to prevent exterior forces from "skewing broadcasts, "
the revised laws also prohibit foreigners from acting as directors,

    <HEADLINE>MOJ WELCOMES SWISS JUDICIAL ASSISTANCE IN LAFAYETTE SCANDAL PROBE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) said Tuesday
that it welcomes a decision by the Swiss authorities to offer
judicial assistance to Taiwan in its probe into a snowballing warship
procurement scandal.</P>
      <P>The Swiss Ministry of Justice announced a day earlier that a
federal court has ruled that Taiwan, France and the Principality of
Liechtenstein should be given access to Swiss legal files,
particularly documents regarding the Andrew Wang family's bank
accounts in Switzerland, to facilitate investigations into an alleged
kickback scandal in connection with Taiwan's procurement of six
Lafayette frigates from France in 1991.</P>
      <P>MOJ officials said they welcome the Swiss court's ruling, which
they said will be helpful in tracking the flow of Wang's slush funds
and shedding light on the alleged kickback scandal.</P>
      <P>Swiss judicial authorities have frozen Wang's Swiss bank
accounts, which contain some US$600 million in slush funds suspected
of being kickbacks from the Lafayette frigate deal.</P>
      <P>Wang, an arms broker, fled Taiwan in 1993 and has been wanted
since September 2000 for suspected involvement in the alleged
Lafayette kickback scandal and the subsequent murder of an ROC navy
captain in 1993.</P>
      <P>Wang and his son, Wang Chia-hsing, might also have bank accounts
with deposits totaling US$100 million in Liechtenstein and the
British-administered Cayman Islands in the Caribbean Sea, according
to previous press reports.</P>
      <P>Since Aug. 1, 2000, a special investigative team headed by State
Public Prosecutor-General Lu Ren-fa, has been probing arms
procurement scandals allegedly connected with the death of naval
captain Yin Ching-feng under suspicious circumstances in 1993.</P>
      <P>MOJ sources said two prosecutors from the Public Prosecutors'
Office of the Taiwan High Court are now handling the case. According
to the sources, the two prosecutors have made several visits to
Switzerland in the past few years and have forged a smooth, informal
working relationship with the Swiss federal court.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an MOJ official said the ministry is striving to sign
judicial assistance agreements with major countries around the world
to facilitate crime solving. "European countries, Switzerland in
particular, are priority targets for signing such accords at the
moment," the official said.</P>
      <P>In the past, he went on, most countries have been reluctant to
negotiate judicial assistance pacts with Taiwan because of the
absence of diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>"Now that the United States has already signed a judicial
assistance accord with Taiwan, we think it will benefit our bid to
negotiate similar pacts with other countries, " the official said,
adding that the MOJ is lobbying for the bid through various channels.</P>
      <P>According to reports from Geneva, it remains uncertain whether
the Taiwan authorities will be able to take possession of the slush
funds in the Wang family's Swiss bank accounts. Taiwan must produce
solid evidence proving that the money came from its payment for the
Lafayette deal, the reports say, with the final result dependent on a
Swiss court ruling.</P>
      <P>The ROC Navy purchased six Lafayette frigates built by French
defense contractor Thomson-CSF for US$2.8 billion in 1991.
Allegations of kickbacks over the deal emerged after the death of
Yin, head of the navy's arms acquisition office, whose body was found
floating in the sea off the east coast of Taiwan in late 1993.</P>
      <P>It has been alleged that Yin was murdered to prevent him from
blowing the whistle on rampant corruption in the military --
including the Lafayette deal.</P>
      <P>The investigation team has so far indicted six middle-ranking
naval officers on charges of inflating the Lafayette price tag for
the benefit of the French contractor. Three other naval officers have
also been indicted for irregularities in the procurement of an order
of minesweepers.</P>
      <P>As for the murder case, no major breakthrough has been achieved
because key suspect Wang, who is believed to be deeply involved in
the Lafayette kickback scandal, remains at large, reportedly residing
in London.</P>
      <P>The investigation team has not yet discovered any hard evidence
of alleged Lafayette kickbacks paid to Taiwan officials.</P>
      <P>To speed up the investigations, the team has recently recruited
several prosecutors versed in financial and banking affairs to assist
in tracking the money trail.</P>

    <DATELINE>Hualien,  Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that
if he wins re-election next March, Taiwan's political ecology will
undergo a dramatic change, and he is sure current chaotic situations
in the Legislative Yuan will end.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he paid a visit to Huang
Sheng-hsiung, superintendent of the Mennonite Christian Hospital in
Hualien, eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president said that he would very much like to put the
controversial Fourth Nuclear Power Plant to a referendum, but
according to the referendum bill passed Nov. 27, there is not enough
time to hold a referendum on the issue on March 20, or the
presidential election day, because of a series of procedural problems
regarding initiating a referendum.</P>
      <P>The president, using Article 17 of the referendum bill, has said
that he would call for a "preventive referendum, " on that day to
demand Beijing to dismantle the missiles targeting Taiwan and
renounce its threat of military force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president said that the Executive Yuan has decided to ask the
Legislative Yuan to reconsider some parts of the recently passed
referendum bill, which could result in the unreasonable provisions
being eliminated.</P>
      <P>But if the Executive Yuan fails to have the legislation reworked,
and Chen wins re-election, the president said he feels that the
political ecology in Taiwan will change dramatically, meaning that
though his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is presently a minority
in the legislature, it will become a majority after his election
victory.</P>
      <P>He said that if the DPP wins legislative elections at the end of
next year, then it will mean that the opposition camp will have "gone
against the will of the majority of the people, " and the legislators
from the opposition camp would have to make adjustment or face being
phased out, which he said will provide the best chance for the DPP.</P>
      <P>"The significance of my re-election bid will definitely terminate
the chaotic situation in politics and in the Legislative Yuan, " he
added.</P>
      <P>He said, "In 2000, Taiwan people used a political transfer to
change Taiwan history, but the historical mission in 2004 will be to
promote the holding of a referendum. "</P>
      <P>He asked why some backward and former communist countries can
hold referendums and Taiwan cannot. He said that 21 countries in the
world sponsored national referendums in 2003, and wondered why "so
many in Taiwan are still seeing referendum as something ominous to be
shunned."</P>

serve the direct shipping links initiated in Jan. 2001 with ports in

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Yu Cheng-hsien said
Tuesday that the silk and filament weaving exclusive zone will help a
great deal to upgrade the competitive edge of the silk sector.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks when he attended the 50th anniversary of the
Taiwan Silk and Filament Weaving Association.</P>
      <P>Yu noted that annual exports of the silk and filament weaving
sector has surpassed NT$100 billion (US$2.94 billion), making it the
major export of Taiwan's textile industry, and that a majority of
businesses have produced high quality and high-value-added silk and
filament weaving products through high-technology and automated
production methods.</P>
      <P>To keep the roots of the companies in Taiwan, businesses
established a silk and filament weaving exclusive zone seven years
ago, which he said will contribute tremendously to the increase of
production value, the creations of jobs, and the upgrading of the
competitive edge.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COUNCIL OF AGRICULTURE TO LOOK INTO EXPORT CONTROVERSY OF BANANAS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture
(COA) said Tuesday that it will soon hold a coordination meeting with
banana growers to settle disputes over a 30-year-old marketing
mechanism.</P>
      <P>Presently, exports of Taiwan bananas have to go through the
Taiwan Provincial Fruit Marketing Cooperative, and big banana growers
have been complaining saying that they are capable of exporting their
produce themselves.</P>
      <P>The big growers earlier sponsored public hearings with the help
of legislators on ending the domination of the marketing cooperative.</P>
      <P>But small banana growers ran ads in the media to oppose the idea
of scrapping the existing marketing mechanism for the sake of their
own existence.</P>
      <P>The big growers asked for free exports mainly because they
themselves have the marketing capability. The decline of banana
exports over the recent years has increased their sentiment.</P>
      <P>They protested against the marketing cooperative for what they
said was "exploitation," because the cooperative buys from contracted
banana growers for NT$12 (US$0.35) or NT$13 per kilogram, which
they say is close to their production costs, but the cooperative
offers bananas at more than NT$60 per kilo to Japan.</P>
      <P>COA officials said that bananas used to be exported freely
overseas. But because of cutthroat competition and small banana
growers' inability to market on the scale of larger growers, the
government has since 1973 had a single export channel, with Taiwan
Provincial Fruit Marketing Cooperative coordinating for exports.</P>
      <P>There are around 10,000 banana growers in Taiwan, and more than
60 percent of them are contracted growers. The planting areas of
bananas is 10,353 hectares, and the production volume is around
226,000 tons, with 89 percent of them going to the domestic market.
The production areas are located mainly in the counties of Pingtung,
Nantou and Kaohsiung, which accounted for 82 percent of all
production.</P>
      <P>But with the production cost of bananas rising, and the steep
competition from low-priced bananas from the Philippines and Ecuador,
exports of Taiwan bananas has dropped over the years.</P>
      <P>COA officials said that with the government's policy to promote
fruits due to the banner crop year, banana exports so far this year
have increased by 36 percent from the same period last year.</P>
      <P>The officials said that banana exports last year were 24,757
tons, accounting for 11 percent of the total production. Exports so
far this year have amounted to 31,981 tons, up 36 percent from the
same period last year, mainly going to Japan.</P>
      <P>As for demands that the government open bananas for free export,
the officials said that they have commissioned National Chung Hsing
University and National Chengchi University to conduct surveys on
banana growers to solicit their views about the 30-year-old marketing
system.</P>
      <P>After the completion of the surveys, the COA will invite members
of the Ministry of the Interior, the Bureau of Foreign Trade, the
Taiwan Provincial Fruit Marketing Cooperative and banana grower
representatives for an overall review of the banana marketing system.</P>

      <P>Two U.S. military strategists -- John

island of Kinmen Tuesday for a visit.</P>
      <P>Caldwell, a research fellow at the Institute for Defense
Analysis, and McVadon, a retired rear admiral, paid a courtesy call
on Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng to get first-hand
information about Kinmen's developments in recent years.</P>
      <P>Lee told his guests that the opening of direct trade, mail and
shipping links between Kinmen and Xiamen in mainland China's Fujian
province, commonly known as the "mini three links, " has contributed
to bilateral commercial and civilian exchanges.</P>
      <P>Since the opening of the "mini three links" in January 2001, Lee
said, Kinmen residents have made 80,000 visits to mainland China
through this new channel. Mainland authorities have decided to allow
Fujian people to make sightseeing trips to Kinmen via the "mini three
links" in the near future, Lee added.</P>
      <P>Caldwell said the opening of the "mini three links" has set a
good model for the development of cross-Taiwan Strait relations.
During his recent trip to Xiamen, Caldwell said residents there have
told him that they hold positive views on the functions of the "mini
three links."</P>
      <P>McVadon, who worked at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing between 1990

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The nearly 500 ballistic missiles deployed
by mainland China targeting Taiwan pose the biggest threat to
stability in the Taiwan Strait, a spokesman for the Presidential
Office said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-fang made the remarks after Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao
toned down his earlier harsh tone against Taiwan in New York Sunday
by paraphrasing a line by famous Taiwan poet Yu Kung-chung to say
that Taiwan, with one narrow strait separating it from mainland
China, is the heartache of China and steeped in nostalgia.</P>
      <P>Wen, who is said to love Chinese poetry, earlier said that
Beijing will not tolerate separatist forces attempting to use
democratic practices like a referendum as "a cover" to achieve
independence.</P>
      <P>Huang noted that since the inauguration of President Chen
Shui-bian in May 20, 2000, the ROC president has done his best to
maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. In fact, the 496
missiles deployed by Beijing in its southeast coastal provinces pose
the biggest threat to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"Citing a poem will not help improving cross-strait relations, "
he said, adding that, "Mainland Chinese leaders should know clearly
what Taiwan people want."</P>
      <P>He reiterated that President Chen's "preventive referendum" will
not touch on his promises made in the inaugural address in 2000,
which included no referendum on the nation's future status.</P>
      <P>Huang stressed that the exchanges between Taiwan and the United
States are good, and the U.S. government has made its stance clear,
which is that the U.S. will not support any referendum that will lead
to the change of Taiwan's status quo, on which both sides agree and
there is no gap between them.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MIXED VOLUNTEER, CONSCRIPTION MILITARY STILL A DEFENSE MINISTRY GOAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  9  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Transforming Taiwan's miliary from a
conscripted force to an all-volunteer one is an aim of the Ministry
of National Defense, but the task will almost certainly not be
completed before 2012, a military spokesman said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In the initial stage, the defense ministry plans to shift the
ratio of the conscription-only military so that 60 percent of
servicemen and women would be volunteers. This will better serve
changing combat demands before 2012, defense ministry spokesman Maj.
Gen. Huang Suey-sheng said at a news conference.</P>
      <P>Legislators from both the "pan-green" camp, led by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party, and the opposition "pan-blue alliance"
led by the Kuomintang, have recently advocated an all-volunteer
military. Some analysts have said, however, that the subject has more
to do with posturing during the run-up to the March 20, 2004
presidential election than streamlining the military.</P>
      <P>Huang said that unless an all-volunteer military plan is enacted
into law and integrated into government policy, the defense ministry
will not comment on any "electioneering language or statement."</P>
      <P>Huang also made public the results of a volunteer recruiting
program that began several months ago, disclosing that the three
military units responsible for recruiting volunteers have managed to
recruit only 367 individuals as of the end of November, against the
original target of 647 volunteers.</P>
      <P>The defense ministry will continue to recruit volunteers using
similar programs in March and September next year to further assess
the feasibility of the experimental plan, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Minister of National Defense Tang Yiau-min said recently at the
Legislative Yuan that an all-volunteer military will be feasible only
when smaller numbers of servicemen and women are required, when the
defense budget reaches a certain level and when all necessary
advanced weaponry systems are acquired -- all of which have been
forecast to be achieved by 2012 or later.</P>
      <P>Tang said it is an irreversible trend that the military is
becoming "lean and mean," with the number of men and women in uniform
gradually decreasing and the forces increasingly becoming high-tech.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BOROUGH CHIEF SALARY ISSUE REQUIRES REVIEW: VICE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A prudent and comprehensive review is needed
before deciding whether to change the posts of village chief and ward
chief into paying jobs, Vice Minister of the Interior Hsu Ying-shen
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hsu made the remarks after a group of independent lawmakers came
up with a proposal calling for amendments to the existing Law on
Local Government Systems to offer salaries to village and borough
chiefs on the grounds that they all work as public functionaries.</P>
      <P>If the proposal is enacted, the government's annual expenditure
will increase by an estimated NT$7 billion. The ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) does not support the proposal, but the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First
Party (PFP), and even the DPP's ally -- the Taiwan Solidarity Union
-- have tentatively shown support for the idea.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan now has more than 7,800 village and borough
chiefs, Hsu said that giving them a salary would involve a wide range
of issues that would require a thorough review from a macro and
forward-looking perspective.</P>
      <P>"If they are given the status of civil servants, problems
regarding examinations, classification and pensions must be
addressed, " Hsu said, adding that these issues as well as relevant
fiscal and budgetary issues require inter-departmental efforts to
resolve.</P>
      <P>Commenting on opposition PFP Legislator Chou Hsi-wei's call that
the Ministry of the Interior should propose a feasible solution to
this longstanding issue, Hsu said the ministry alone cannot solve it.</P>
      <P>Villages and boroughs are grassroots administrative units. Each
of them has an office headed by a chief elected by popular vote for a
four-year term. Village and borough chiefs only receive subsidies for
office overhead and are not salaried.</P>

Studies Center, said in the commentary, entitled "U. S. Is Caught
Between Two Governments Glaring Across a One-China Policy," that
Premier Wen comes to Washington this week to tell the United
States to rein in Taiwan's democracy and keep Taiwan from replacing
its constitution.</P>
      <P>Feldman, who is a retired ambassador and one of the authors of
the Taiwan Relations Act, said Washington's "One China policy" says
"we have diplomatic relations only with Beijing, though we maintain
all other relations with Taipei, and we 'acknowledge' China's claim
to the island, but we make no statement about Taiwan's status."</P>
      <P>"There is one stipulation: We insist that any change in that
status must be accomplished peacefully, and with the consent of
Taiwan's people," he added.</P>
      <P>Feldman said President Bush should quote to Wen the words of the
Taiwan Relations Act: The United States will 'consider any effort to
determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means,
including by boycotts or embargoes, a threat to the peace and
security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the
United States."</P>
      <P>President Bush might replay his April 2000 statement about doing
whatever it takes to help Taiwan defend itself if attacked, Feldman
said.</P>
      <P>But in any case, Feldman said, the president should add: "It
really is time, even past time, for your government to sit down and
talk directly to the government in Taiwan-- without preconditions,
without treats. And without expecting the United States to carry your
water for you."

    <HEADLINE>PRIVATE GROUPS CALL FOR CLEAN ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the presidential election campaign
gradually heating up, major private groups met at the Legislative
Yuan Tuesday to urge presidential candidates to commit themselves to
a clean election.</P>
      <P>Chai Sung-lin, president of the National Clean Election Promotion
Association, said at the "clean election and transparent politics"
seminar that his association will join forces with other social
groups in pushing the contenders in the upcoming presidential
election to stick to clean election principles.</P>
      <P>Scholars, experts and representatives of major public-interest
groups were invited to attend the seminar to discuss measures for
promoting a clean election.</P>
      <P>As the major candidates for the March 20, 2004 presidential
election are running neck and neck, Chai said, they have increasingly
resorted to improper rhetoric and divisive tactics aimed at stirring
up ethnic sentiments.</P>
      <P>"Their moves set a bad example of behavior for society and are
detrimental to Taiwan's fledgling democratic system, " Chai said,
adding that he is hopeful of integrating social forces to press
presidential candidates to conduct a clean election in order to
create a clean and transparent political environment and provide the
people with a "government of integrity."</P>
      <P>Chai outlined seven key principles for clean elections: no
vote-buying; no violence; no involvement of criminal gangs; no
mud-slinging; no environmental pollution and damage; no corruption;
and no extravagance in campaigning.</P>
      <P>The upcoming election will mainly be a race between President
Chen Shui-bian and Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan who is running under
the banner of the opposition "pan-blue alliance."</P>

    <HEADLINE>ADMINISTRATION SHOULD DEAL WITH WARD CHIEF SALARY ISSUE: PFP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The administration should squarely face the
issue of whether village and borough chiefs should receive a salary,
and not just leave the issue to lawmakers and consider it solved, an
opposition People First Party (PFP) lawmaker said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chou Hsi-wei, a PFP party whip at the Legislative Yuan, urged
legislators from across the political spectrum to stop bickering
among themselves on the salary issue and called for the Ministry of
the Interior to face the problem and work out a solution.</P>
      <P>The legislative Independents Alliance recently proposed an
amendment to Article 61st of the Rural Administration Act, suggesting
that the position of village or borough chief should be changed into
a paid position since those holding such posts work as public
functionaries.</P>
      <P>The proposal, if enacted into law, would cost the government some
NT$7 billion (US$205.88 million) a year.</P>
      <P>The borough is the lowest government administrative level in
Taiwan. Each borough has an office headed by a ward chief who is
elected by popular vote for a four-year term.</P>
      <P>Chou said the Ministry of the Interior, regardless of whether
from the financial point of view or the point of view of the local
chiefs' status, should make efforts to tackle the issue.</P>
      <P>He said the Ministry of the Interior should first come up with a
clear plan on the issue so that the Legislature can deliberate on it,
adding that the longstanding issue can then be resolved once and for
all.</P>

    <TEXT>The Manila Bulletin: GMA
defends decision on executions.

President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo is merely abiding
by the rule of law when she ordered the resumption of
judicial executions in the country, Malacanang said
yesterday.

The Philippine Daily Inquirer: Palace woos Roco
anew.

FOR THE second time, Malacanang has asked former
senator Raul Roco to drop his bid for the presidency
to give way to President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo's
own, and as before, Roco's camp has flatly rejected
the request, an Inquirer source said Tuesday.

The Philippine Star: Robot seeks forgiveness.

Abu Sayyaf leader Ghalib Andang, whose ruthless
al-Qaeda-linked kidnap gang has tainted the
Philippines' image abroad, has asked the government
to give him a chance to "redeem himself," the military
said yesterday.

The Manila Times: LP goes for GMA.

The Liberal Party will likely choose President
Arroyo as its standard-bearer, eliminating the need to
hold talks with the other touted presidential
contenders Raul Roco, the screen idol Fernando Poe Jr.
and Sen. Panfilo Lacson.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>THERE IS MUCH SPACE FOR TAIWAN FOR IT CONTRIBUTION: ICT HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Dec.  10 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Jose Maria Figueres, chief of a United
Nation's panel on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) ,
hailed Taiwan's achievement Wednesday in the information technology
development, saying that there is much room for the island to
contribute in this sphere.</P>
      <P>Figueres, a former Costa Rican president, who is now U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's special representative on ICT, noted
that Taiwan is not a UN member, thus is limited in its participation
in global high-tech cooperation programs.</P>
      <P>"It's a pity for the island and for the U.N., " Figueres told a
Taiwanese delegation who was to participate in the World Summit on
the Information Society (WSIS) to be held at U.N. headquarters Dec.
10-12.</P>
      <P>However, Figueres stressed that there is still much space for
Taiwan to contribute to global ICT development, for example, in the
sub-groups under the ICT panel of the U.N. which allows for the
participation of private enterprises, non-governmental organizations
and government officials.</P>
      <P>Figueres said he knew the complex reasons for Taiwan not being a
U.N. member. However, he stressed that the island's high-tech
development is a world model, and urged the island to share with the
world community its successful experiences, or even failed ones.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's exclusion from the U.N. is a loss to the
world organization, Figueres said he is willing to promote Taiwan's
further participation in the sphere of high technology in the future.</P>
      <P>Members of the Taiwan delegation include Minister Without
Portfolio Tsai Ching-yen, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  10 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday
that his plan to call a "defensive referendum" on the day of the
presidential election next March 20 is to maintain peace in the
Taiwan Strait area.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in his speech delivered after accepting the
nomination by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) as the
party's candidate in the upcoming presidential race.</P>
      <P>Holding the referendum has nothing to do with the
independence-unification issue, but to practice democracy and to
maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait, Chen stressed.</P>
      <P>"No one can force the people of Taiwan to see Beijing's
deployment of missiles directed at the island as a normal development
and no one could construe the 23 million people's intention to pursue
democracy and to maintain peace as provocative," Chen emphasized.</P>
      <P>Noting that holding a referendum is a normal practice in a
democratic nation and a basic right of the people, Chen said that the
people of Taiwan can loudly vow to the world that "They are opposed
to missiles and want democracy; they are opposed to the war and want
peace."</P>
      <P>It is to show the international community, particularly Beijing,
that the use of military force can never serve as a means or a option
to solve the so-called Taiwan issue, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president announced earlier this month that the topics to be
voted on in Taiwan were whether or not the people would wish to have
mainland China withdraw the nearly 500 ballistic missiles currently
targeting Taiwan soil and whether the mainland should renounce any
use of force against Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vernon Smith, winner of
the Nobel Prize for economics in 2002, said Wednesday that mutual
trust is the key to promote trade between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait, and he urged the people on both sides to work toward this
direction.</P>
      <P>Smith made the remarks in a speech on globalization and Taiwan's
economic development after receiving an honorary doctoral degree from
National Sun Yat-sen University.</P>
      <P>Smith won the Nobel Prize for economics for his pioneering work
in experimental economics, a discipline that maintains that informal
rules and social norms can influence people's choices, and the
testing for these effects is much more productive in a laboratory
than in real time.</P>
      <P>The Nobel laureate noted that experimental economics aims at
observing and predicting economies, as well as simulating various
kinds of economic behaviors to allow people to better understand
economic structures. However, he added that all economic problems
have the nature of unpredictability.</P>
      <P>On how to elevate Taiwan's competitiveness and production, Smith
said that only offering subsidies cannot resolve problems, and he
suggested that the government offer more training in addition to
protecting or increasing workers' minimum salaries.</P>
      <P>Only through more training programs can people earn satisfactory
income, thus elevating in the same time the corporate
competitiveness, Smith went on.</P>
      <P>The 76-year-old Smith, now a professor of economics and law at
George Mason University, has authored or co-authored over 200
articles and books on capital theory, finance, natural resource

    <HEADLINE>BASIC TONE OF U.S. POLICY TOWARD TAIWAN REMAINS UNCHANGED: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The basic tone of the U.S. policy toward
the Taiwan Strait issue has remained unchanged after a meeting
between U.S. President George W. Bush and mainland Chinese Premier
Wen Jiabao, Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene Chien said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Judging from Bush's reaffirmation at a news conference
after his talks with Wen in Washington, D.C. Tuesday that the United
States opposes any unilateral decision by either China or Taiwan to
change the status quo, Chien said the basic tone of the U.S. policy
toward the cross-strait issue has not changed.</P>
      <P>Chien said Bush has reiterated Washington's one-China policy based
on its three joint communiques with Beijing and its Taiwan Relations
Act. The gist of the U.S. one-China policy requires a peaceful
solution to cross-strait disputes, opposes China using force against
Taiwan and offers no support for Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>"Bush's remarks after his meeting with Wen signal no fundamental
changes to the basic U.S. policy toward the cross-strait issue,"
Chien noted.</P>
      <P>As to Bush's statement that he opposes "comments and
actions made by the leader of Taiwan" that indicate that President
Chen Shui-bian "may be willing to make decisions unilaterally, to
change the status quo," Chien said Washington apparently still
doesn't fully understand Taiwan's "defensive referendum" plan.</P>
      <P>Chien said the planned referendum on missile threat from China is
for strengthening Taiwan's young democracy, avoiding war, maintaining
stability in the Taiwan Strait and preserving the status quo.</P>
      <P>"President Chen himself has on many occasions declared that the
referendum plan has nothing to do with the subject of independence
and will not breach his 'four noes plus one pledge,'" Chien said,
adding that the plan doesn't violate the U.S. strategic goal of
maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Chien said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will strengthen
communications with the United States and will continue to make the
United States understand the basic spirit of Taiwan's defensive
referendum plan and that mainland China's military build-up and
missile deployment against Taiwan are the real source of
cross-strait tension.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) said
Wednesday its efforts to promote no-smoking restaurants have achieved
encouraging results, with 770 establishments around the island being
smoke free.</P>
      <P>The DOH launched the no-smoking restaurants campaign a year ago.
Thanks to support from restaurant operators and public health
promotion groups, a DOH official said 770 restaurants around the

      <P>Chao Kun-yu, deputy director of the DOH's Bureau of Health
Promotion, said his bureau commissioned Taipei Medical University to
conduct surveys in February and November to explore public opinions
about the smoking-free restaurant campaign.</P>
      <P>In the February survey, 70 percent of the respondents said they
endured second-hand smoke in restaurants. But only 57 percent of
those interviewed in the November survey said they had encountered

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT SETS CONTINUED REFORMS AS PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THEME</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian described his
campaign theme and major political and economic agendas Wednesday
after he was formally nominated by the Democratic Progressive Party
to represent the ruling party in the March 20, 2004 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>The president delivered an acceptance speech on the theme of
"believing in Taiwan, insisting on reforms" at the Central Executive
Committee of the DPP after his nomination.</P>
      <P>For the DPP and he himself, Chen said, the significance of the
presidential election is not about a ruling position nor is it about
defeating other candidates or political parties, but about the need
to solidify democracy and continue with reforms.</P>
      <P>He noted that during the process of democratization in Taiwan,
there has always been a tug-of-war between pro-reform and anti-reform
forces and that although the party has to "reflect upon itself and
accept them, " there should be no regression in democratic reforms.</P>
      <P>In retrospect, the democratic development of Taiwan, from the
lifting of martial law in 1987 to the popular election of the
president, has been a "winding, bumpy road and every democratic
reform has been resisted by the conservative regimes, even in the
face of the verbal attacks and military intimidation from the other
side of the Taiwan Strait," he said.</P>
      <P>But he said the Taiwan people have strong convictions of the
value of democracy and reforms and can move forward step by step and
"make the land vibrant with democratic dynamism."</P>
      <P>He noted Taiwan completed the first peaceful political transfer
in the Chinese world in 2000 and that as it moves towards democracy
and human rights, some opposition parties still dwell on the past
authoritarian period.</P>
      <P>He also said that the endless haggling between the ruling and
rival parties must come to a stop and no matter what the
difficulties, all chaos must end after the March 20 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>"With my strong conviction in democracy and Taiwan's future, "
Chen said, the strength of the people must be pooled to complete the
normalization of Taiwan's democracy in three stages.</P>
      <P>First, he claimed, after March 20, 2004, the confrontation
between the ruling and the rival parties and the stalled cross-Taiwan
strait relations will be defrosted and will move toward the path of
normalization.</P>
      <P>Next, the DPP, riding on the coattails of his election victory,
will gain a majority in the year-end legislative election in 2004, so
that the checks-and-balances mechanism between the executive and
legislative arms will be normalized.</P>
      <P>In the third stage, a national referendum will be held in 2006 on
a new Constitution, with the aim of ending the chaotic constitutional
rule so that Taiwan can become a "normal, complete and great"
democratic country.</P>
      <P>He said that from the long-term view of democratic development,
the start of the next presidential term in 2004 to the implementation
of a new Constitution in 2008 will be a crucial period to solidify
democracy and strengthen reforms.</P>
      <P>"This is why the DPP has made believing in Taiwan and insisting
on reforms its campaign theme," he added.</P>
      <P>For this reason, the presidential election next year will be a
"three-verse" competition, he said, meaning his advocacy of "one
country on each side of the Taiwan Strait" rather than "one China, "
insistence on reforms rather than the restoration of the corrupt
"black gold" of the previous administration and belief in Taiwan
rather than pessimism.</P>
      <P>He accused the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has always being on
the side of anti-democracy and anti-reform, citing the KMT and its
"pan-blue alliance" partner the People First Party for ramming
through a referendum bill Nov. 27 as an example of this. He said the
ruling party will reconsider, ask for a constitutional interpretation
and a revision in order to return a complete referendum bill to the
people.</P>
      <P>He reaffirmed that the Taiwan people have the right to speak out
their opposition to the missile threat posed by the mainland and
their desire for democracy, and to declare to the world that
"military force is never a means or option for solving the
cross-strait issue."</P>
      <P>"The pursuit of democracy of the 23 million people of Taiwan and
their efforts to maintain peace should not be considered
`provocation'" of the mainland, he added.</P>
      <P>The president also said that over the past three years, the
government has continued to push for reforms and has displayed its
power of implementation, which is reflected in recent favorable
ratings by international assessment organizations.</P>
      <P>If the Cabinet's "10 new major public construction projects" plan
takes off next year, it is expected to create 64,000 jobs per year
and to increase economic growth by 1.03 percent every year.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that if re-elected, he will say with confidence
that he will achieve within three years the "3-4-5" goal -- meaning
that the budget for research and development will reach over 3
percent of the gross domestic product, the jobless rate will drop to
below 4 percent in two years, and the economic growth will increase
to 5 percent in 2004.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States will stick to its
pledge to help Taiwan defend itself should Beijing use force against
Taiwan, a senior U.S. official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The official made the comment after U.S. President George W.
Bush met visiting mainland Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao for talks in
Washington.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the Bush's pledge made in April 2001 to help Taiwan
remains valid and that the United States will stop playing ambiguous
games on the issue, the official quoted Bush as telling Wen: " Look,
you know, if you force us, if you try to use force or coercion
against Taiwan, we are going to be there."</P>
      <P>Asked whether the United States will also help Taiwan if it
provokes mainland China, such as by holding a referendum on the
independence-unification issue, the official made it clear that
Washington will give clear messages to both sides that Beijing should
not use military force against Taiwan, while Taiwan should not move
toward independence.</P>
      <P>It would be very dangerous for Taiwan to change the status quo
unilaterally, the official noted, adding that Bush's concern over
Taiwan's plan to hold a defensive referendum is aimed at ensuring
that the people of Taiwan are aware that the United States will never
agree on Taiwan's intention to unilaterally change its current
status.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER URGES U.S. TO RECOGNIZE MAINLAND CHINA AS SOURCE OF TENSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun urged the United States
Wednesday to recognize that mainland China is the real source of the
tension across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"Mainland China, rather than Taiwan, is the source of
cross-strait tension," Yu said at a weekly Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>Yu made the appeal a day after U.S. President George
W. Bush said during a meeting with mainland Chinese Premier Wen
Jiabao at the White House: "We oppose any unilateral decision by
either China or Taiwan to change the status quo, and the comments and
actions made by the leader of Taiwan indicate that he may be willing
to make decisions unilaterally to change the status quo, which we
oppose."</P>
      <P>Commenting on Bush's statement, Yu said Taiwan's "defensive
referendum" plan is primarily aimed at reminding the international
community that the mainland's threat to use force against Taiwan and
its missile deployment against Taiwan are abnormal and irresponsible.</P>
      <P>"The referendum plan is designed to stave off the possibility of
mainland China using force to change the Taiwan Strait status quo, "
Yu said, adding that the move should not be regarded as an act
designed to provoke Beijing.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the referendum plan is part of Taiwan's democratic
reform efforts, Yu said that Beijing's deliberate distortion of the
plan as a move toward independence is "anti-democratic."</P>
      <P>Yu said that although the mainland has repeatedly claimed that it
will not forsake its hope of resolving cross-strait issues through
peaceful means, it has actually stepped up military deployment along
its southeastern coast to intimidate Taiwan's government and people.</P>
      <P>"Beijing's military build-up vis-a-vis Taiwan has threatened the
stability in the Taiwan Strait," he noted.</P>
      <P>The premier further said that Taiwan's government and people are
concerned and dissatisfied with the mainland's intensified military
deployment against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Moreover, we believe that a continued laissez-faire attitude
toward mainland China's missile deployment against Taiwan could
mislead Beijing's leaders into making a grave misjudgment that will
eventually jeopardize peace in the Taiwan Strait and the entire
Asia-Pacific region," Yu said, adding that he hopes the United States
can understand that it is the mainland rather than Taiwan that is the
chief cause of tension across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Yu further said the main cause of the cross-strait disputes lies
in mainland China's reluctance to squarely face up to the reality of
Taiwan's existence as an independent sovereign state and its refusal
to resume bilateral dialogue and consultation on an equal footing.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's policy toward the mainland has remained
unchanged, Yu said Taiwan will continue to pursue a peaceful solution
to cross-strait disputes.</P>
      <P>He also urged the mainland to drop all political premises and
resume dialogue with Taiwan as soon as possible. "Only dialogue and
consultation can clear up misunderstandings and forge rapprochement
and consensus," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WILL CONTINUE TO COMMUNICATE WITH U.S. OVER REFERENDUM ISSUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's representative
to the United States said Tuesday that Taiwan will continue to
communicate with the United States on the referendum issue.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-jen made the remarks in the wake of remarks by U.S.
President George W. Bush on the cross-Taiwan Strait situation after
his meeting with mainland Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao at the White
House.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on ROC President Chen Shui-bian's proposed plan
to hold a referendum on March 20, 2004, Bush said that "we oppose any
unilateral decision by either China or Taiwan to change the status
quo" and "the comments and actions made by the leader of Taiwan
indicate that he may be willing to make decisions unilaterally to
change the status quo, which we oppose," he added.</P>
      <P>In a telephone interview with CNA, Chen would not speculate on
Bush's words or their possible effect on Taiwan's plan to hold a
"defensive referendum" to demand that Beijing dismantle its missiles
aimed at Taiwan and to renounce the use of military force, but he
expressed the hope that the government's push for referendum in three
aspects be understood.</P>
      <P>First, Chen said, Taiwan "cannot accept" mainland China seeing
the referendum, which is an exercise in democracy, to be a referendum
on independence.</P>
      <P>Chen continued that the proposed referendum does not involve
issues on either unification or independence and that it will not go
beyond the pledges that the president made in his inaugural speech of
2000 in which he promised not to hold a referendum on the status of
the nation and not to change the status quo.</P>
      <P>Chen said that it is unfair to see Beijing's missile threat
against Taiwan as "normal" on the one hand, and Taiwan's worry over
this threat as "provocation" on the other.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he has yet to explain this to the United States,
but he pointed out that this is the attitude of Taipei on the issue,
and he added that the government will continue to communicate with
Washington.</P>
      <P>Chen refused to comment on whether he felt Bush's words were
beneficial or detrimental to Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Seismologists warned Wednesday that major
aftershocks of an intensity greater than 5 on the open-ended Richter
scale could occur at any time in the next month in the wake of the
6.6-magnitude quake that jolted eastern Taiwan earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>The 6.6-magnitude jolt, which began at 12:38 p.m., had a violent
effect on the eastern county of Taitung, causing landslides and
damage to some roads and bridges, with varying levels of intensity
felt all over the country.</P>
      <P>No casualties had been reported as of press time except for one
man reported to have been trapped in an elevator in Fengshan City,
southern Taiwan, seismologists from the Central Weather Bureau (CWB)
said.</P>
      <P>Four major aftershocks with magnitudes between 4 and 5 were
detected in the Taitung area within one hour of the quake.</P>
      <P>Describing the quake as the result of pressure released from the
squeezing action between the Philippine Sea Plate and the Euroasia
Plate, Kuo Kai-wen, director of the CWB Seismology Center, said major
quakes of a magnitude larger than 5 can be expected to occur in areas
near Taitung at any time within the next month.</P>
      <P>Taiwan sits on the Circum-Pacific Belt, which encompasses fault
lines stretching from the coast of Chile to California and around
through Japan and Taiwan. The belt is, along with the large European
Alpida Belt, responsible for 95 out of every 100 earthquakes that
occur around the world, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>The island experienced its deadliest earthquake in five decades
on Sept. 21, 1999, when a 7.6 magnitude temblor struck central
Taiwan, killing 2,415 people and injuring more than 10,000. It also

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING OPTS FOR TALKS AMONG CARRIERS ON CHARTER FLIGHTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  Dec.  10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing has opted to allow private air
carriers to negotiate over the operation of cross-Taiwan Strait
charter flights during the Chinese New Year holiday, sources from the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>ARATS officials said that they had informed their Taipei
counterparts -- officials from the quasi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) -- by telephone that Beijing decided to let the
private air carriers from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait discuss
the New Year charter flights.</P>
      <P>The ARATS officials said that Beijing insists that any such
charter flights must be bilateral and that it will allow the carriers
themselves to engage in talks over the technical issues.</P>
      <P>The officials also said that ARATS has not replied to a message
sent by the SEF Nov. 27 calling for consultations on the charter
flight plan.</P>
      <P>The SEF letter, mailed at the request of the Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), said that Taiwan is willing to allow
mainland carriers to offer the charter flight services, but as
two-way services involve the exercise of public authority, including
security checks, the SEF said the two sides must meet to hammer out
mutually acceptable operational terms.</P>
      <P>As of Wednesday, ARATS had not responded to the SEF appeal.</P>
      <P>According to ARATS officials, Pu Zhaozhou, a Civil Aviation
Administration of China (CAAC) official in charge of Taiwan, Hong
Kong and Macau affairs, was to meet later that day with
representatives from four Taiwan carriers for talks on affairs
surrounding the the charter flights. The four carriers are EVA
Airways, China Airlines, Far East Air and Trans Asia Airways.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Chen Ming-tong said last week that the MAC,
which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China, has completed all
necessary preparations that Taiwan can do unilaterally for the
special holiday cross-strait charter flight plan.</P>
      <P>"We are now waiting for mainland China to take coordinated action
regarding its part of the plan, " Chen said, adding that he believes
the mainland will act in time to facilitate the return of Taiwan
businessmen operating in mainland China and their dependents for
Chinese New Year.</P>
      <P>In an unprecedented move, six Taiwan carriers were allowed to
operate charter flights between Shanghai and Taiwan via either Hong
Kong or Macau during the last Chinese New Year holiday early this
year.</P>
      <P>According to the MAC's blueprint, the flights can be operated
from Jan. 9 through Feb. 2, 2004. Chinese New Year's Day falls on
Jan. 22.</P>
      <P>The stopover points will include other designated third locations
in addition to Hong Kong and Macau. The departure and arrival points
on the Taiwan side will remain unchanged at Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport and Kaohsiung International Airport, while
Beijing's Capital Airport will be added to the mainland's departure
and arrival points list. Previously, only Shanghai's Pudong Airport
was on the mainland list.</P>

Confucius' lesson of the day: "A young man, when at home, should
be a good son; when out in the world, a good citizen. He should be
circumspect and truthful. He should be in sympathy with all men, but
intimate with men of moral character. If he has time and opportunity
to spare, after the performance of those duties, he should then
employ them in literary pursuits."</TEXT>

      <P>U.S. President George Bush was rapped
Thursday by an international human rights activist for comments he
made about President Chen Shui-bian's intention to hold a referendum.</P>
      <P>Scott Horton, president of the International League for Human

made several years ago when he said that democracy, human rights and
people's right to self-determination are the three pillars of peace.</P>
      <P>Bush told a press conference in Washington the previous day that
the comments and actions made by Chen indicate that he may be willing

      <P>Northern Taiwan's port of Keelung handled
less cargo and fewer containers in November than it did October, but
it performed better than the same month of a year ago, according to
the latest statistics released Thursday by the Keelung Harbor Bureau.</P>
      <P>The harbor handled 7.95 million tons of cargo in November, down by
6.78 percent from the October level but up by 7.15 percent
year-on-year. It loaded and unloaded a total of 174,205 TEUs
(twenty-foot-equivalent units) last month, a fall of 2.78 percent
from the month-earlier level, but up by 7.99 percent as compared to
the figure posted in the same month of last year.</P>
      <P>During that period, 746 ships called at the post -- the largest
in northern Taiwan -- down by 11.4 percent from the October level,
but an increase of 3.04 percent over the previous-year level, the
bureau statistics show.</P>
      <P>During the first 11 months of this year, the port dealt with
84.57 million tons of products, up by 4.36 percent compared to the
volume registered in the same 11-month period of 2002. It handled

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN POISED TO BECOME A GLOBAL SOC HUB</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is poised to become a global
system-on-a-chip (SoC) design and service hub in three to five years,
as the government has begun allocating budgets and pooling its
efforts and wisdom to promote a national SoC project, an official
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Yu Kuei-shin, an advisor at the Department of Industrial
Technology under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) , made the
remarks at a high-tech symposium on SoC -- the 2003 SoCTEC1st --
which opened that day in Taipei under the joint sponsorship of the
department and the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI).</P>
      <P>According to Yu, the MOEA has earmarked more than NT$900 million
(US$26.47 million) this year to advocate the national SoC project
with the aim of developing Taiwan into an international SoC center in
cooperation with the academic and industrial sectors to provide a
sound IC design platform that will serve corporate clients around the
world.</P>
      <P>In addition to SoC technology, Yu said, the government also hopes
to promote nanotechnology, optical telecommunications and
biotechnology as part of its efforts to make Taiwan an advanced
research and development and innovation center in the Asia-Pacific
region.</P>
      <P>Taiwan must seize this opportunity to edge out mainland China,
Singapore, South Korea and India, as the IC design industries in the
United States and Europe have been increasingly shifting their
attention to Asia since 2000, he said, noting that Taiwan's IC design
industry enjoys the second-highest market share internationally.</P>
      <P>ITRI President Lee Chung-hsi said Taiwan must consolidate its
talent and resources from relevant fields -- such as Internet
telecommunications, SRAM and Flash -- to forge new thinking and
create innovative products to compete in the SoC arena. The main
issue is about how to put all the core technologies and functions
into a single chip, he explained.</P>
      <P>Scores of Chinese experts from home and abroad will discuss
market deployment, industrial trends and technology exchanges in the
SoC industry at the two-day gathering.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC INSISTS ON GOVERNMENT ROLE IN CHARTER FLIGHT TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Negotiations for mainland Chinese air
carriers' participation in cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights during
the upcoming Chinese New Year holiday should be led by either the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) or the government, a senior
official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen made the
remarks a day after mainland authorities said they would allow
mainland carriers to discuss the holiday charter flight issues with
Taiwan carriers.</P>
      <P>Tsai said Taiwan is willing to allow mainland carriers to offer
the holiday charter flight services on a reciprocal basis, but she
added that as such two-way services involve the exercise of public
authority, the two sides must meet to hammer out mutually acceptable
operational terms.</P>
      <P>"Such talks must be carried out by the SEF or under the
government's oversight," Tsai added.</P>
      <P>Acting on the MAC's request, the SEF sent a message to its
mainland Chinese counterpart Nov. 27 calling for consultations on the
charter flight plan. The Beijing-based Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) has so far not made a formal
response to the SEF's appeal.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are quasi-official bodies set up by Taiwan and
the mainland, respectively, to handle cross-strait contacts in the
absence of official ties between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Tsai said she hopes the mainland authorities will respond to the
SEF's call as soon as possible to allow the charter flight plan to be
fleshed out.</P>
      <P>"The exercise of public authority, including security checks,
forms the cornerstone of government operations. We cannot compromise
on this issue, " Tsai stressed. "We hope the mainland authorities can
understand this point."</P>
      <P>In an unprecedented move, six Taiwan carriers were allowed to
operate charter flights between Shanghai and Taiwan via either Hong
Kong or Macau during the last Chinese New Year holiday early this
year.</P>
      <P>Zhang Mingqing, spokesman for mainland China's Taiwan Affairs
Office, said in Beijing Nov. 26 that the mainland is not opposed to
allowing a repeat of the charter flights, so long as the services are
offered on a reciprocal basis. Zhang further said that any
negotiations on technical details of the services must be carried out
by the air carriers on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward the
mainland, has decided to exercise more flexibility and further expand
the charter flight plan for the upcoming Chinese New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>According to the MAC's blueprint, the flights can be operated
from Jan. 9 through Feb. 2, 2004. Chinese New Year's Day falls on
Jan. 22.</P>
      <P>The midpoints where the flights have to make a stopover will
include other designated third locations in addition to Hong Kong and
Macau. The departure and arrival points on the Taiwan side will
remain unchanged at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport and
Kaohsiung International Airport, while Beijing's Capital Airport will
be added to the mainland's departure and arrival points list.
Previously, only Shanghai's Pudong Airport was on the mainland list.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXECUTIVE YUAN ASKS LEGISLATIVE YUAN TO RECONSIDER REFERENDUM BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  11 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan formally asked the
Legislative Yuan Thursday to reconsider part of the referendum bill
railroaded through the Legislative Yuan by the opposition parties
Nov. 27.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan spokesman Lin Chia-lung said that 12 of the 64
articles in the bill were considered unacceptable by the Cabinet and
needed to be returned to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>Although the bill is a step forward in terms of the development
of democracy, Lin said, part of it is "unconstitutional" because it
gives the Legislative Yuan the power to initiate referenda on major
policy formulated by the Executive Yuan while denying the Executive
Yuan a similar right.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the spokesman said, the setting up of a referendum
review committee called for in the bill is unnecessary, as its
function would be the same as that of the existing Central Election
Commission.</P>
      <P>Under the Constitution, the returned bill will be automatically
annulled unless the Legislative Yuan rejects the request within 15
days with a majority vote of at least 113 in the 225-seat
legislature.</P>
      <P>If that scenario takes place, the premier will have to either
accept the Legislative Yuan's decision or step down.</P>
      <P>Since the two main opposition parties control a narrow
legislative majority of 113 seats between them, every vote will count
in case of a showdown.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition parties claimed that the Executive
Yuan's move gives the lie to the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's claim that it is the driving force for the right to
referendum.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng said the Executive
Yuan's request is unprecedented in that it challenges only part of
the bill and in some cases, even only a section of an article.</P>
      <P>"Usually, we are called upon to deal with a whole article rather
than a section of it, " Wang said, adding that it is up to the
lawmakers to determine how to respond to the request.</P>

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said on Thursday
that in this very special age, Taiwan needs extraordinarily brilliant
leaders to assure sustainable development for the island.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks in a speech after being nominated formally by
President Chen Shui-bian as his running mate for the March 20, 2004
presidential election. Chen was officially designated by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party the previous day as the party's
presidential candidate in the election.</P>
      <P>In the press conference, Chen also presented personally five key
figures who will be responsible for Chen's campaign activities,
ushering in a fierce competition with the "pan-blue" camp composed of
the opposition Kuomintang and the People First Party.</P>
      <P>Lu said in her speech that Taiwan is facing many problems in this
rapidly changing world, including complicated cross-Taiwan Strait
ties, its diplomatic relations with foreign countries, the problem of
an aging society, and the ethnic problems resulting from foreign
brides.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is bothered by many problems, it still has
created economic and democratic miracles, Lu noted, adding that the
peaceful power transition in 2000 has terminated the former
authoritarian rule of more than five decades and strengthened human
rights on the island.</P>
      <P>Because of the existence of Taiwan, there is a force to fight
against communism, Lu went on.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REFERENDUM PLAN TALLIES WITH U.S. VALUES: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
the United States should support Taiwan's drive to consolidate its
young democracy and should push Beijing to publicly renounce the use
of force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"In line with its founding spirit, the United States should
support our pursuit of full democracy and demand that mainland China
remove the missiles it has deployed against Taiwan and renounce the
use of force against Taiwan, " Chen said during a meeting with Scott
Horton, president of the New York-based International League for
Human Rights.</P>
      <P>Chen has faced intense pressure from Taiwan's most important
friend -- the United States -- since he announced late last month
that he wants to hold a "defensive referendum" on the day of the next
presidential election on March 20, 2004 to demand that Beijing stop
pointing hundreds of missiles at Taiwan.</P>
      <P>American officials have said the referendum could raise the risk
of conflict with the mainland, which claims sovereignty over Taiwan.
U.S. President George W. Bush said Tuesday that he opposes any moves
that might disrupt the delicate status quo in Taiwan-China relations.</P>
      <P>Chen took advantage of his meeting with Horton to defend the
referendum plan, stressing that it is in line with America's
democratic values, which should allow voters to express opinions
about threats.</P>
      <P>Since referendum is a universal value and a basic human right,
Chen asked why the Taiwan people should be singled out to be denied
the right to hold such a vote as part of its drive to be free from a
missile threat.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the planned referendum on demanding Beijing
remove missiles aimed at Taiwan and renounce the use of force against
Taiwan is designed to preserve Taiwan's present status as an
independent sovereign state.</P>
      <P>"We have no intention of changing our status quo. We instead want
to maintain the status quo characterized by peace, democracy, freedom
and human rights. We'll do whatever we can to prevent it from being
changed," Chen said.</P>
      <P>In terms of America's founding spirit, Chen said he is convinced
that the United States will not accept Beijing's missile deployment
against Taiwan as a matter of course, nor will it regard Taiwan's
pursuit of full democracy and efforts to maintain peace as
"provocative" actions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT INTRODUCES KEY MEMBERS OF HIS REELECTION CAMPAIGN TEAM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian introduced five
key members of his campaign team Thursday, saying that together they
will fight a "fair, clean, and victorious" battle to win the March
20, 2004 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The president, one day after he was formally nominated by the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to be the standard bearer
of the party, nominated Annette Lu, current vice president, to be his
running mate again, and also introduced his campaign team members.</P>
      <P>Chang Chun-hsiung, DPP secretary-general, will head the team. The
other four members are Premier Yu Shyi-kun, Kaohsiung Mayor Frank
Hsieh, Taipei County Magistrate Su Tseng-chang, and Presidential
Office Secretary General Chiou I-jen.</P>
      <P>The president also elaborated on the "significance of naming Lu
and his campaign team" which encompasses four areas -- insistence on
democracy, the shouldering of responsibility, the nurturing of
talented people, and all-around teamwork.</P>
      <P>The president said that looking back over the past quarter
century, whether it is the vice president or the campaign team, each
one of them has contributed a great deal to this land of Taiwan for a
large part of their lives.</P>
      <P>"They share the identical beliefs in democracy and they have left
their footprints on the path of democracy, and they will now join
hands to make history again in 2004," the president said.</P>
      <P>The president also said that the DPP is just like a democratic
family, and has the tradition of a pluralistic democracy, saying that
becoming a ruling party is a shouldering of responsibility, and not
the sharing of interests.</P>
      <P>He also said that the team is significant in terms of nurturing
talented individuals. He said that since the inception of the party
in 1986, the DPP has accumulated rich experiences in democracy, and
has also nurtured a pool of talented people along the way and the
tradition will continue for future generations.</P>
      <P>Finally, he said that this is an "all-around" team, encompassing
heavyweights from every part of Taiwan who have rich experience in
both local and central governments, in the legislative and executive
branches, as well as the party and government posts.</P>
      <P>Including himself, the president said that the team has one
president, one vice president, two party chairmen, two premiers, two
vice premiers, and two city majors, magistrates who have served more
than one term, and countless legislators and city and government
councilmen. He said that this must be the "strongest ever" team.</P>
      <P>He stressed that for the sake of the nation's future, the team
will work toward fighting a "fair, clean, high-quality and
victorious" battle in the presidential election.</P>

on Wednesday denied a news report that said his participation
in aforum on global e-business at the U.N. headquarters in Geneva was
aimed at turning the technical forum into a political forum.</P>
      <P>According to a Washington Times report, Tsay "slipped into" the
U.N.-sponsored conference earlier this week, where he publicly
challenged the policy of excluding Taiwan from the United Nations
for more than 30 years.</P>
      <P>Tsay, commenting on the report, said he attended the forum in his
capacity as an advisor to the secretariat of AFACT, an international
non-governmental organization, adding that he obtained an entry badge
to the U.N. compound through proper procedures.</P>
      <P>The Washington Times report also indicated that Tsay "publicly
chastised" mainland China for its policy of blocking Taiwanese
participation in numerous international organizations.</P>
      <P>Tsay strongly refuted the report, emphasizing that in his public
speech, he never touched upon political issues. Actually, in his
opening remarks to the forum, Tsay focused on Taiwan's information
and communication technology achievements and its intentions to
further contribute to the global campaign to narrow the digital
divide.</P>
      <P>He said he regretted the fact that some news reports
misinterpreted his speech.</P>
      <P>"We want to make it clear that Taiwan wants to be an active
player to promote information and communications technology for
humanitarian and development purposes and that it has no intention of
mixing this up with politics," Tsay said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN THANKS BUSH FOR SECURITY COMMITMENT TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian thanked U.S.
President George W. Bush in an interview with Cable News Network
(CNN) Thursday for his support for Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>Bush told mainland Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao in their meeting at
the White House Tuesday that if China uses force or coercion against
Taiwan, then the United States would have to get involved.</P>
      <P>Chen said in his interview with CNN Asia correspondent Mike
Chinoy that he appreciates Bush's concern and support for Taiwan's
security.</P>
      <P>Chen also reiterated that his "defensive referendum" plan is by
no means aimed at changing Taiwan's status quo. Chen was responding
to Bush's remarks made at a news conference following his talks with
Wen that he opposes "comments and actions made by the leader of
Taiwan" that indicate that Chen "may be willing to make decisions
unilaterally, to change the status quo."</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that the referendum to be held on the day of the
next presidential election on March 20, 2004 is to preserve Taiwan's
status quo, rather than change it. This stance basically squares with
Washington's, he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that the planned referendum will ask Beijing to remove its
hundreds of missiles pointed at Taiwan and to renounce the use of
force against Taiwan, Chen said he will be willing to shelve the plan
so long as mainland China makes a goodwill response.</P>
      <P>Chen said he has on many occasions explained that the referendum
plan is a necessary step to strengthen and consolidate Taiwan's young
democracy. "The plan has nothing to do with the subject of
independence and will not breach my 'four noes plus one' pledge, "
Chen said, adding that the scenario of holding the referendum to
change Taiwan's status quo would not happen at all.</P>
      <P>In the face of mainland China's missile threat, Chen said, the 23
million Taiwan people should have the right to express their view and
feelings.</P>
      <P>The referendum aims to express Taiwan people's feelings, Chen
said, adding that it's unfair and illogical to regard the move as an
act of provocation to Beijing. Chen said the world should not accept
Beijing's missile deployment against Taiwan as a matter of course.</P>
      <P>Chen denied that the referendum plan is a campaign ploy for his
re-election bid. Chen said he feels a strong sense of responsibility
to have referendums -- a form of democracy and a universal value --
take root in Taiwan. It would help save social costs to time the
referendum with the next presidential election, he added.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Beijing regards Taiwan's referendum plan as a step
toward independence, Chen said the Republic of China on Taiwan has
long been an independent sovereign country and has never been
subjugated to the People's Republic of China -- mainland China's
official title.</P>
      <P>"This is the status quo and a historical fact. As the ROC's top
leader, I'm obligated to defend national sovereignty and to prevent
it from becoming a local government or administrative region of any
other country," he stressed.</P>
      <P>In its pursuit of freedom and democracy, Chen said, Taiwan has
never intended to provoke a war. If Beijing makes a goodwill response
to Taiwan's call for rapprochement and stops pointing missiles at the
island, Chen said, it will win Taiwan people's friendship.</P>
      <P>If Beijing insists on twisting Taiwan's referendum plan to mean a
provocative act, Chen said, it would only further alienate the people
of Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SUAO-HUALIEN FREEWAY CONSTRUCTION PROJECT TO BE POSTPONED: YU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hualien,  Taiwan, Dec. 11 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Thursday
that Hualien County Government will be given a three-month grace
period to decide whether to construct an expressway linking the
eastern county to Suao in the neighboring northeastern county of
Ilan.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks after County Magistrate Hsieh Shen-shan told
him that Hualien County residents have not yet reached a consensus on
the Suao-Hualien Freeway construction project. Yu was briefed on
Hualien residents' opinions during an inspection tour of the ongoing
Hualien Airport expansion project.</P>
      <P>Construction on the 86-km freeway was originally scheduled to get
underway late this month. As some Hualien residents have publicly
opposed the project over environmental concerns, Hsieh asked Yu to
give the county government more time to forge a consensus among local
residents.</P>
      <P>Yu said the central government is sincere about carrying out the
project to help boost eastern Taiwan's economic and tourist
development.</P>
      <P>"All preparatory work has been completed. So long as the county
government and residents reach a positive decision, construction can
kick off immediately, " Yu said, adding that the central government
will respect the county government's decision.</P>
      <P>Yu further said that it's up to the county government and the
county council whether to hold a county-wide referendum to decide
whether to build the new expressway. "A final decision must be made
within three months," he added.</P>
      <P>The Suao-Hualien Freeway project has been included into the
government's "five year, five hundred billion NT dollar"
infrastructure construction plan. The planned freeway calls for an
outlay of NT$92.6 billion and was originally scheduled for completion
in 2011.

    <HEADLINE>PUBLIC OPINION IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IN FREEWAY DECISION: YU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Respecting the opinion of Hualien residents
is the most important consideration in deciding whether or not to
build the Suao-Hualien Freeway, Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Friday.</P>
      <P>Yu confirmed Friday at the Legislative Yuan that development of
the Suao-Hualien Freeway -- which would be eastern Taiwan's first --
will be postponed for three months to provide time to gauge public
opinion in the region on the issue.</P>
      <P>The Suao-Hualien Freeway, which would link Suao in Ilan County
with Chian in Hualien County, is one of the "10 New Construction
Projects" that the Executive Yuan has set forth for implementation in
the following five years.</P>
      <P>Yu said that since the freeway system will mainly affect Hualien
County, the decision on whether to build it needs to take into
account Hualien public opinion, adding that it is up to the county
government and county council whether to conduct an opinion poll or
hold a county-wide referendum on the issue.</P>
      <P>Yu denied that the Executive Yuan decision to postpone the Su Hua
Freeway Project is the result of political considerations as claimed
by the opposition parties. He called for the opposition camp to
refrain from politicizing the issue.</P>
      <P>He also said that the decision to postpone the freeway project
for three months has nothing to do with a recent meeting between
President Chen Shui-bian and Master Cheng Yen, founder of the
Hualien-based Tzu Chi Buddhist Compassionate Relief Foundation,
during which the latter reportedly asked Chen to call a halt to the
project out of environmental considerations.</P>
      <P>The opposition camp lambasted the administration Thursday for
what it claimed was the administration's manipulation of public
construction projects for political gains.</P>
      <P>Noting that the administration actively pushed for the Su Hua
Freeway Project last year during the run-up to the Hualien county
chief by-election which the opposition KMT subsequently won, the
opposition camp questioned the motives behind the administration's
decision to call a halt to the project in the run-up to the
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, those in the academic circle as well as environmental
protection activists in eastern Taiwan have lauded the administration
for what they call a wise decision.</P>
      <P>However, members of the business community in Ilan and Hualien
have expressed disappointment with the decision, pointing out that
transportation is the key to development and that the freeway will
generate rural development, improve the local economies and reduce
unemployment.</P>

      <P>Time is clearly on Taiwan's side in
its tug-of-war with China, the country should be patient in dealing
with Beijing by keeping the across-Taiwan Strait status quo, said a
well-knowned international columnist Jonathan Power.</P>
      <P>In a letter to the editor carried on Friday's Jordan Times which
was seen here, the columnist said China is changing so fact that the
chances of there being a Chinese Gorbachev is not just wild dreaming-
increasingly it looks as if President Hu Jingtao could be preparing
to play that role.</P>
      <P>A more democratic China will not be the end of all points of
controversy between it and Taiwan, but it will surely make Taiwan's
life much easier in all sorts of important ways. Taiwan has to give
China time. Time is Taiwan's friend, said Power.</P>
      <P>The long-lasting U.S. policy of double-deterrence- deterring
China from an invasion, on the one hand, and deterring the Taiwanese
from moving to declare their country independent suffers from a
fundamental flaw; it ignores what may be the democratic wish of a
majority inside Taiwan, Power said.</P>
      <P>However, it came as no surprise that the Bush administration,
which has its hands full with Irag and Afghanistan and needs Beijing
to support its efforts to persuade North Korea to nuclear disarm
would sent an envoy to Taipei to encourage Chen to stop any attempt
to alter unilaterally its ties with the mainland.</P>
      <P>He dismissed Taiwan leaders' attempts to draw a parallel between
Beijing's missile threat against Taiwan and the Cuba's missile threat
against the United States in 1960s, saying that Beijing's 496
missiles which are not tipped with nuclear warheads will do no more
harms than what NATO did with 500 missiles on Belgrade four years
ago.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WANTS WRITTEN RESPONSE FROM MAINLAND OVER CHARTER FLIGHTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 12 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan prefers a written response from the
mainland over negotiations about charter flights between Taiwan and
Shanghai during the Chinese Lunar New Year, a mainland affairs
official said Friday.</P>
      <P>With the Chinese Lunar New Year only 40 days away, chances for
charter flights between Taiwan and the mainland seem dim. However,
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Chen Ming-tong said at a
news conference Friday that Beijing's Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait replied by phone to its Taiwan counterpart,
the Straits Exchange Foundation, regarding Taiwan's offer to talk on
lining up the charter flights, but Taiwan prefers a formal response
in writing.</P>
      <P>Taiwan air carriers provided charter flights between Shanghai and
Taiwan with a brief stopover in Hong Kong or Macau earlier this year
during the previous Chinese Lunar New Year. They would like to
continue the flights this time around to serve Taiwan businessmen
working on the mainland.</P>
      <P>However, Beijing aviation officials said mainland carriers that
were excluded from the service last time should join in the operation
this time and take a share of the market.</P>
      <P>The MAC agreed right away but insisted on negotiating with
Beijing over the details, a request at which Beijing balked. Beijing
has severed all official contacts with Taiwan since 1999 because of
Taiwan's refusal to acknowledge that it is a part of China and will
not resume discussions now because of concerns that it might lend a
hand to President Chen Shui-bian's presidential campaign.</P>
      <P>As a result, the charter flight service plan is still up in the
air.</P>
      <P>The proposed charter flights would fly the current route between
Taiwan and Shanghai with a stopover in either Hong Kong or Macau. The
only difference would be that passengers would not have to change
planes during the stopover.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
estimated that more than 15,000 Taiwan businessmen in Fujian
province, southern China, will return to Taiwan during the Chinese
Lunar New Year via Taiwan's frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>That figure will be four times more than that of the last Chinese
Lunar New Year when 3,500 persons returned from Kinmen and 65 from
Matsu.</P>
      <P>They will be ferried by boats from Xiamen or Fuzhou, both in
Fujian, to the two islands before taking a 40-minute flight back to
Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Representatives of various foreign-based
Taiwanese groups filed a strong protest Friday against remarks made
recently by mainland Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, representatives from Taiwanese
academic, women's and medical groups based overseas expressed fierce
dissatisfaction with Wen's opposition to Taiwan's plan to hold a
"defensive referendum" on March 20 next year, which he aired during a
meeting Tuesday with U.S. President George W. Bush at the White
House.</P>
      <P>They accused Beijing's leaders of fueling Chinese nationalism by
playing with the Taiwan issue in an attempt to consolidate their
power base.</P>
      <P>Stating that they firmly support President Chen Shui-bian's plan
to hold the referendum on the same day as the next president
election, they said the president has done the right thing by
deciding to hold a referendum to secure Taiwan's status quo.</P>
      <P>"The Taiwan people are entitled to demonstrate their desire not
to be threatened by mainland missiles, " they said, claiming that
Taiwan independence can be achieved one day as long as the United
States maintains its stance and does not give way to pressure from
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Despite what is seen by some analysts to be a rebuke from Bush,
Chen has vowed to go ahead with the referendum as planned.</P>

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A pro-Taiwan independence group protested
Friday against remarks made by U.S. President George W. Bush
regarding Taiwan he made during a meeting with Chinese Premier Wen
Jiabao.</P>
      <P>Headed by Wang Hsien-chi, chief executive of the Alliance to
Campaign for Rectifying The Name of Taiwan, the group went to the
American Institute in Taiwan -- the de facto U.S. embassy -- to
protest against the "improper" remarks made by Bush that they claimed
tried to force the Taiwan people to abandon their democratic rights
and represented a double standard regarding the implementation of
democracy.</P>
      <P>In the Bush-Wen meeting, Bush said the United States policy
continues to adhere to its "one China" policy and it opposes any
unilateral decision by either mainland China or Taiwan to change the
status quo.</P>
      <P>"The comments and actions made by the leader of Taiwan indicate
that he may be willing to make decisions unilaterally, to change the
status quo, which we oppose, " Bush was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Bush was responding to President Chen Shui-bian's recent
announcement that he will hold a "defensive referendum" on March 20,
2004, the day of the presidential election, asking the people of
Taiwan if they want Beijing to dismantle the 496 ballistic missiles
targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A referendum law passed recently by the Legislative Yuan gives
the president the right to initiate a referendum on national security
issues in case of an external threat.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the passage of the referendum law is
considered by "most Taiwan people" as a democratic achievement.
However, Bush has tried to push the Taiwan people to abandon
this right as a way of kowtowing to mainland China, which considers
such a referendum as an initial step toward independence.</P>
      <P>The U.S. government wants to implement democracy in Iraq, but
opposes Taiwan's conducting a referendum on the country's national
security, which represents a double standard, Wang said. He urged
other Taiwan associations to also protest against Bush's remarks.</P>

      <P>Investment by the private sector into
build-operate-transfer (BOT) joint ventures in cooperation with the
government is expected to total more than NT$60 billion (US$1.77
billion) for the whole of this year, according to a government
official.</P>
      <P>Public Construction Commission (PCC) Chairwoman Kuo Yao-chi
reported that as of Dec. 9, 26 BOT cases had been approved since the
beginning of this year, attracting around NT$59.17 billion. The
figure may top NT$60 million for the whole of 2003, an 8.1-fold
increase over the year-earlier level, she assessed.</P>
      <P>Kuo pointed out, however, that the figure falls well short of the
target of NT$100 billion set originally for the year.</P>
      <P>According to the PCC head, various important BOT cases are
currently being assessed by an investment-promotion panel under the

plans at fishing ports and railway stations.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Lin Hsin-i, who heads the investment promotion

inaugurated Dec.
20, an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Lee Shu-tung, a section chief of MOFA's NGO Affairs Committee,

      <P>Lee noted that this will be the first time the government has
financed an information exchange platform between Taiwan's NGOs and
the international community, and the first time the government has
set up an online NGO center.</P>
      <P>The content of the Website includes an introduction of the
development of Taiwan's NGOs, related conference information and
links to related issues, providing a channel for Taiwan NGOs to
exchange and share information.</P>
      <P>The Website, www.taiwanngo.org.tw, also provides a portal to
Taiwan's NGOs and allows browsers to gain an understanding of the
present situation of Taiwan's NGOs.</P>
      <P>Lee said that in tune with the bilingual Website, the ministry
will also sponsor an exhibition to display the achievements of the
country's NGOs.</P>
      <P>The exhibition will be divided into five major categories:
democracy, human rights and peace; humanitarian assistance
and medical treatment; social welfare for women, children, the
disabled and aboriginal people; environmental protection,
conservation and voluntarism; and arts, sports and leisure.</P>
      <P>The exhibition will show clearly the NGO's results in promoting
international affairs, Lee said.</P>

      <P>A Taichung jewelry merchant whose shop

      <P>Yang Tian-tzu and Huang Chun-shen recently submitted NT$1 million
to the Ministry of the Interior as a guarantee deposit, formally
registering as the third ticket in the March 20, 2004 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>Huang, the jewelry merchant, put the jewelry on sale at Taichung

just 38 people to sign.</P>

percent in November this year, another record low, the Ministry of
the Interior (MOI) reported Friday.</P>
      <P>A total of 18,815 babies were born in November this year,

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An immigrants rights promotion alliance
urged the government Friday to upgrade the status of a planned
immigration administration to better protect the rights of new
immigrants and legal foreign contract workers.</P>
      <P>The newly formed alliance, which groups major organizations
dedicated to helping the underprivileged as well as foreign and
mainland Chinese spouses, said the government should upgrade the
planned immigration administration to a Cabinet-level agency.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-drafted immigration administration organizational
statute, which is pending legislative approval, prescribes an
immigration administration under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of
the Interior (MOI).</P>
      <P>However, as immigration affairs involve not only the
MOI-administered welfare services but also education, work and
economic issues, the alliance said the immigration administration
should be put under the direct jurisdiction of the Cabinet to
facilitate inter-departmental coordination and upgrade the new
agency's operational efficiency.</P>
      <P>The alliance also pointed out several flaws and deficiencies in
the draft statute, including the absence of regulations governing the
recruitment and cultivation of translators as well as the absence of
a supervisory mechanism and channels for immigrants to file
complaints and appeals.</P>
      <P>According to the draft statute, 75 percent of the new
administration's staff members are police officers. "It seems to us
that the government regards foreign and mainland Chinese spouses of
local citizens as potential criminals," said an alliance spokesman.</P>
      <P>Foreign and mainland spouses form the bulk of new immigrants to
Taiwan. "We are hopeful that the police ratio can be reduced while
more professional counselors can be recruited to offer better services
to new immigrants and foreign contract workers," the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the spokesman said, the draft statute fails to lay out
a permanent residence (PR) system. "We hope the immigration statute
will include PR provisions to protect new immigrants' rights, " he
added.</P>
      <P>The spokesman also urged the government and the media to do
more to help new immigrants adapt to local society and
to educate the public to drop its prejudice toward foreign
and mainland Chinese spouses.</P>

    <HEADLINE>2003 AUSTRONESIAN CULTURAL FESTIVAL TO BE HELD IN TAITUNG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 2003 Austronesian Cultural Festival,
one of 12 local festivals subsidized by the Tourism Bureau under the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications, will be held in
Taitung, eastern Taiwan, Dec. 20-31.</P>
      <P>In addition to original and colorful programs to be presented by
local aboriginal groups, folklore art performance groups from Canada,
Japan, Indonesia, South Korea and Hawaii are also expected to stage
performances during the 10-day 2003 Austronesian Cultural Festival,
whose theme is "Weaving and Knitting -- The Beauty of Austronesian
Handicraft."</P>
      <P>The festival, the fifth of its kind, is being co-sponsored by the
Taitung County government and the National Museum of Prehistory
located in downtown Taitung City.</P>
      <P>Local aboriginal groups -- including the Atayal, Amis, Bunun,
Saisiat, Tsou, Puyuma, Rukai, Paiwan and Dawu -- will also send their
own dancing or artistic troupes to take part in the festival,
officials from the Taichung Bureau of Cultural Affairs said.</P>
      <P>An Austronesian Night gala party is set to run from the evening
of Dec. 31 through to the small hours of Jan. 1, 2004, as a special
event different from those held in previous years, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's indigenous people could either have originally come from
the southern part of China or from the vast region called the
Austronesian-language area, which spans from Madagascar eastward
across the Indian and Pacific oceans to Easter Island, and from
Taiwan southward to New Zealand.</P>
      <P>In a new theory developed in Australia and New Zealand in recent
years, anthropologists believe that Taiwan is the place where the
Austronesian-language people originated.</P>
      <P>Professor Geoffrey Chambers of Victoria University in Wellington,
New Zealand, believes that the Maori people and other Polynesian
peoples of the Pacific "island-hopped" from Taiwan through the
Philippines and Indonesia to West Polynesia. From there, he says,
they traveled to the islands of East Polynesia and then southwest,
eventually settling in New Zealand.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's aboriginal citizens are considered the northernmost
Austronesian people. The government currently divides them into 10
major mountain tribes and 10 Pingpu groups. While elements of the
languages and culture of the 10 mountainous races have been
maintained, most of the native languages of the Pingpu people have
died out, with no traces remaining, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Among the mountain tribes, the Saisiat and the Atayal are
believed to have migrated to Taiwan some 3,000 years ago.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's Pingpu groups -- aboriginal people who lived
in low-lying areas around the island, many of whom intermarried with
Han Chinese -- can be roughly divided into 10 different groups,
including the Ketagalan in the Taipei area and the Kavalan in the
eastern Ilan area. The remnants of these groups are now working to
establish the identity of their respective tribes and refuse to
accept the notion that their tribes have died out.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SWISS JUSTICE MINISTRY RESERVED ON SIGNING AGREEMENT WITH TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Dec.  12 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Swiss Ministry of Justice spokesman
maintained a reserved attitude when asked about Taiwan's hopes of
signing a judicial assistance agreement with his country, saying
Switzerland could not possibly sign such agreements with every single
country.</P>
      <P>The spokesman, however, stressed that even if there is no
judicial assistance agreement between the two countries, Switzerland
can still provide sufficient judicial assistance to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>His remarks came after the Swiss Ministry of Justice announced
earlier this week that a federal court had ruled that Taiwan, France
and the Principality of Liechtenstein should be given access to the
Swiss legal files, particularly the Andrew Wang family's bank
accounts in Switzerland, to facilitate investigations into an alleged
kickback scandal in connection with Taiwan's procurement of six
Lafayette frigates from France in 1991,</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Ministry of Justice (MOJ) welcomed the decision by the
Swiss authorities, saying it would be helpful in tracking the flow of
the alleged slush funds of Wang, an arms dealer, and in shedding more
light on the case.</P>
      <P>The MOJ further said that in its efforts at signing judicial
assistance agreements with other countries, the ministry has listed
Switzerland as a priority.</P>
      <P>However, the Swiss Ministry of Justice spokesman, when asked
about Taiwan's hopes of signing a judicial assistance agreement with
Switzerland, did not give a direct answer. He said that in the
absence of such an agreement, Switzerland can still extend judicial
assistance to Taiwan, such as that given earlier this week, based on
an international judicial assistance law.</P>
      <P>He also said that Switzerland is currently actively negotiating
the signing of judicial assistance agreements with Latin American
countries, saying that these countries are the nation's top priority
on this issue.</P>

      <P>A Pentagon investigation has found evidence that a subsidiary of

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER CALLS FOR LEGISLATIVE SUPPORT FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun delivered a report to
the Legislative Yuan Friday on the government's ambitious 10 new
major construction projects, which call for an outlay of NT$500
billion over the next five years.</P>
      <P>Yu urged the opposition-controlled Legislature to support the
Cabinet-drafted bill on expanding public investment in infrastructure
construction to allow for the government to borrow money to finance
the new major construction projects.</P>
      <P>"The planned new construction projects will help sustain Taiwan's
economic growth and further upgrade the nation's overall
competitiveness in the global market, " Yu said at a legislative
plenary session.</P>
      <P>In May 2002, Yu recalled, the Cabinet launched a "Challenge 2008"
six-year national development plan, with "three reforms and four
investment directions" as its theme. The plan has so far born fruit,
he said.</P>
      <P>According to Yu, Taiwan ranks first among all Asian countries and
fifth in the world in the 2003 global Growth Competitiveness Index
compiled by the Swiss think tank the World Economic Forum. And
Taiwan's ranking in the annual World Competitiveness Report compiled
by the International Institute for Management and Development (IMD)
advanced from seventh in 2002 to sixth in 2003.</P>
      <P>"These figures indicate that the "Challenge 2008" plan has
contributed to the improvement of Taiwan's global competitiveness, "
Yu said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the "10 new construction projects" epitomize the
essence of the "Challenge 2008" six-year plan, Yu said the new
projects aim to accelerate Taiwan's transformation and upgrading in
various fields.</P>
      <P>The 10 new projects include manpower cultivation, research and
development, upgrading of quality of life, environmental protection,
sustainable development, and enhancement of global competitiveness,
Yu said.</P>
      <P>From the viewpoint of cost efficiency, Yu said, now is the best
time to launch the 10 new construction projects. "If we do not take
action now, we'll regret it in the future. By doing it now, we'll be
able to save a large amount of money," he claimed.</P>
      <P>If the Legislature passes the special budget plan for the 10 new
construction projects, Yu said, Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP)
will increase by between 1.0 percent and 1.4 percent in real terms
annually over the next five years, while private demand will rise by
between 0.6 percent and 0.8 percent. The projects are also expected
to create 64,000 job opportunities annually during the five-year
period, Yu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yu added, the government's tax revenues will increase
by NT$70 billion to NT$150 billion during the five-year period.</P>

      <P>A senior Taiwan security official is
currently in Washington, D.C. to gain a first-hand understanding of

      <P>Ko Cheng-heng, a deputy secretary-general of the National
Security Council, arrived in the U.S. capital a day after the
Bush-Wen meeting at the White House on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, Ko's visit was scheduled before the
Bush-Wen meeting and is not directly related to Bush's recent
criticism of Taiwan's leader.</P>
      <P>Bush said at a news conference following his talks with Wen that
he opposes "comments and actions made by the leader of Taiwan" that
indicate that President Chen Shui-bian "may be willing to make
decisions unilaterally, to change the status quo."</P>
      <P>Despite the U.S. concern that Taiwan's planned "defensive
referendum" might disrupt the delicate status quo in cross-Taiwan
Strait relations, President Chen has reaffirmed his determination to
go ahead with the plan to hold a "defensive referendum" on the day of
the next presidential election on March 20, 2004 that would allow
the people of Taiwan to voice their opposition to Beijing's
military threat to their country.</P>
      <P>In addition to collecting information about the details of the

    <HEADLINE>BUSH URGED TO RECONSIDER POSITION ON TAIWAN REFERENDUM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec. 12 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The leaders of the U.S. Congressional
Taiwan Caucus have urged President Bush to reconsider his opposition
to a referendum in Taiwan that would allow its citizens to voice
their opposition to mainland China's military threat to their
country.</P>
      <P>During his public briefing with mainland Chinese Premier Wen
Jiabao this week, President Bush warned Taiwan's president, Chen
Shui-bian, to resist making any unilateral moves toward independence,
including holding a defensive referendum on missiles and other
military threats by the People's Republic of China toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a letter sent to the president, Reps. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio),
Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), Dana Rohrbacher (R-Calif.) and Robert Wexler
(D-Fla.) wrote that "the mounting threats and hostile actions taken
by the PRC toward Taiwan underscore the volatility of the situation
on both sides of the Taiwan Strait."</P>
      <P>"The continued build-up of missiles and military exercises on
China's southeast coast remind us that democratic Taiwan and its
people face a constant and imminent threat from an authoritarian
regime," they wrote.</P>
      <P>The members said the administration's action signaled a victory
for the People's Republic of China at the expense of Taiwan's
democratic reforms.</P>
      <P>"The Bush administration's vocal opposition to any referendum in
Taiwan would be seen as a great victory for mainland China and a
defeat for Taiwan's democratic reforms. It may seem like splitting
hairs, but the language is important to our long-term interests in
that region, " said Brown, a co-founder of the Congressional Taiwan
Caucus.</P>
      <P>The Congressional Taiwan Caucus, which includes more than 120
members of Congress, has also led efforts to formalize support for
Taiwan's efforts to gain recognition by international bodies,
including the World Health Assembly and the United Nations.
The text of the letter follows:
Dear President Bush:</P>
      <P>We urge your administration to cease its opposition to a
democratic referendum in Taiwan on the issue of China's ballistic
missiles targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The defensive referendum as proposed by President Chen Shui-bian
does not alter the status quo of cross-strait relations by seeking a
declaration on independence. Rather, it is intended to express the
immediate and legitimate concerns of the Taiwanese on the peace and
security of the region.</P>
      <P>The people of Taiwan are particularly worried, and rightfully so,
about the increasing missile deployment across the Taiwan Strait by
the People's Republic of China (PRC) . Just recently, President Chen
indicated that 496 missiles have been placed on China's coast, with
the capability of reaching Taiwan in under ten minutes. This number
was not disputed by the PRC, and it is estimated to increase by 50
missiles annually.</P>
      <P>The mounting threats and hostile actions taken by the PRC toward
Taiwan underscore the volatility of the situation on both sides of
the Taiwan Strait. The continued build-up of missiles and military
exercises on China's southeast coast remind us that democratic Taiwan
and its people face a constant and imminent threat from an
authoritarian regime.</P>
      <P>Mr. President, in your November 19 "Three Pillars" speech in
London, you spoke about America's strong commitment to the global
expansion of democracy. We applaud your efforts to promote democracy
and freedom and look forward to joining in efforts to garner
international support for this important campaign.</P>
      <P>However, we are deeply concerned that a vocal opposition to a
Taiwanese referendum would send the wrong signal to the international
community that the United States is not fully committed to expanding
democracy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is a thriving democracy that promotes freedom and the rule
of law. It is our hope that your administration will move away from
its opposition to a referendum asking that the PRC withdraw the
hundreds of ballistic missiles threatening the people of Taiwan. We
look forward to working with you to strengthen our friendship with
Taiwan and further promote democracy in East Asia. Thank you for your
consideration of this important matter.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN PUTS FORTH THREE QUESTIONS TO MAINLAND PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian put forward three
questions to mainland Chinese President Hu Jintao Saturday in a
speech delivered at a national congress of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>President Chen challenged the top mainland Chinese leader to
answer why the term "one country on each side of the Taiwan Strait"
does not apply, why China cannot renounce the use of force against
Taiwan and cannot remove its hundreds of missiles pointed at Taiwan,
as well as why Taiwan cannot take part in the World Health
Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>In his speech, Chen also reaffirmed his determination to hold a
"defensive referendum" on the day of the next presidential election
on March 20, 2004 that would allow the people of Taiwan to voice
their opposition to mainland China's missile deployment against their
country.</P>
      <P>"We'll hold the referendum to express our opposition to missiles
and war while highlighting our desires for peace and democracy," Chen
said, adding that protecting Taiwan from China's threat is one of his
most important missions as the nation's top leader.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Beijing's harsh criticism of Taiwan's referendum
plan, Chen said he wants to represent the 23 million people of Taiwan
in asking mainland Chinese President Hu why his description of "one
country on each side of the Taiwan Strait" cannot apply since Taiwan
is a democratic country while mainland China is a communist state.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the people of Taiwan love peace, Chen asked Hu why
Beijing cannot publicly renounce its option of using force against
Taiwan and dismantle its missiles deployed against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen further asked Hu why Taiwan should be denied access to the
WHO even though its people want to play an active role in world
health care and medical affairs.</P>
      <P>If Beijing authorities cannot make a goodwill response to these
questions, Chen said, then he believes the Taiwan people will come up
with options in the March 20 referendum.</P>
      <P>Chen further said the Taiwan people have the right to voice their
opposition to the missile threat posed by the mainland and their
desire for democracy, and to declare to the world that "military
force is never a means or option for solving the cross-strait issue."</P>
      <P>Noting that mainland China's missile deployment has not only
threatened peace in the Taiwan Strait but also stability in the
entire Asia-Pacific region, Chen said the world should not accept
Beijing's military threat to Taiwan as a matter of course.</P>
      <P>He reminded the world that mainland China's military build-up,
rather than Taiwan's referendum plan, is a threat to Taiwan's status
quo and that Taiwan's pursuit of full democracy should not be
considered as an act of provocation against China.</P>
      <P>Describing his nomination as the DPP candidate for the next
presidential election as the beginning of "an enormous duty and a new
hope, " Chen said he will lead the DPP and the people of Taiwan in
"turning a marvelous page" in the nation's history.</P>
      <P>Chen said "believing in Taiwan, insisting on reforms" will be his
presidential campaign theme. He reaffirmed his determination to
complete the democratic reform "trilogy" -- namely holding Taiwan's
first-ever referendum on March 20, 2004, writing a new constitution
for Taiwan in 2006, and enacting the new constitution on May 20,
2008, to make Taiwan a "normal, complete and great" democratic
country.</P>
      <P>"In the first step, the DPP must win the 2004 presidential
election, " Chen said. "If we manage to win the election, we have the
mandate to push the opposition 'pan-blue alliance' of the Kuomintang
(KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) to normalize domestic
inter-party relations and to force the Chinese Communist Party on the
mainland to normalize cross-strait relations," he noted.</P>
      <P>In the second stage, Chen said, the DPP must do its utmost to win
a majority in the next legislative elections to be held in late 2004.
"Once the DPP and its allies manage to gain a majority in the
Legislative Yuan, we'll be able to normalize relations between the
legislative and executive branches and enhance administrative
efficiency," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>In the third phase, Chen continued, the DPP will push for the
formulation of a new constitution to be put to a referendum in 2006
and for formal implementation from May 20, 2008. "By then, all the
constitutional chaos will have become history and Taiwan will have
become a genuine and great democracy," he said.</P>
      <P>Recalling that Taiwan's democracy, prosperity and peace have
never been godsent, but rather hard-won achievements, Chen said
his determination to carry out sweeping democratic reform will never
be swayed by pressure by Beijing or domestic opposition
parties.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years, Chen said, his administration has
continued to push for reforms and has displayed its capability of
implementation, which is reflected in recent favorable ratings by
international assessment organizations.</P>
      <P>In his 30-minute speech, Chen also outlined his economic
platform, saying that the "10 new major public construction
projects" unveiled by the Cabinet will further upgrade Taiwan's
national competitiveness and enhance the quality of life.</P>
      <P>The new projects are expected to create 64,000 jobs per year,
Chen said, adding that they will also help raise Taiwan's annual
economic growth by 1.03 percent over the next five years.</P>
      <P>If re-elected, Chen said, he will achieve within three years the
"3-4-5" goal -- meaning that the budget for research and development
will reach over 3 percent of the gross domestic product, the jobless
rate will drop to below 4 percent in two years, and the economic
growth will increase to 5 percent in 2004.</P>
      <P>Chen further said the upcoming presidential election will be
a "three-versus" competition, meaning his advocacy of "one
country on each side of the Taiwan Strait" versus the pan-blue
alliance's "one China" notion; insistence on reforms rather
than the restoration of the corrupt "black gold" of the previous
administration; and faith in Taiwan rather than pessimism.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SARS HURTS TAIWAN TRAVEL AGENCIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although Taiwan has weathered severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS), the epidemic has had a serious impact on
local travel agencies which said their yearly profit targets will be
hard to achieve, an industry source said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The massive outbreaks of the potentially deadly SARS in the first
half of this year has had a very large impact on local travel
agencies, most of them small- and medium-sized businesses, despite a
rebound in business from July, the source said.</P>
      <P>A vast majority, or some 80 percent of them, which operate
outbound travel, said they might post losses for the whole of this
year on the grounds that trips to mainland China, the No. 1 overseas
destination among Taiwan tourists, have been fewer for the
traditional peak season beginning every September, it added.</P>
      <P>In the face of the many economic and political uncertainties
remaining in the international community, domestic travel or those
specially designed high-class tours to newly explored destinations
may emerge as better options for many Taiwan people, the source said.</P>
      <P>With regard to the mainland Chinese market, local travel agencies
should seek to design high-class, in-depth tours featuring special
cuisine and landscape to lure Taiwan tourists at a time when a fever
for mainland travel is fading because of a lack of new attractions,
Hsu Kao-ching, secretary-general of the ROC Federation of
Associations of Travel Agents, said.</P>
      <P>Destinations in some emerging markets are worth exploring by
Taiwan-based travel agencies, Hsu added.</P>
      <P>Chang Chin-ming, chairman of the Phoenix Tours International
Inc., one of Taiwan's largest travel agencies specializing in
outbound tours, said specially designed, high-class and in-depth
trips will prevail in the future, given the fact that more than seven
million Taiwan tourists go abroad every year.</P>
      <P>Russia, Vietnam, Japan and India have the potential to become
popular markets for Taiwan tourists seeking extraordinary
attractions and new experience, he added.</P>
      <P>As to domestic travel, many destinations at home are very
competitive with their hot springs, theme parks and fine hotels, a
travel agency operator said, adding that there is ample room for the
market to grow at a time when the economy has yet to recover fully.</P>
      <P>Smart customers are waiting for economical, high quality and
finely designed tours, a source noted.</P>

      <P>Lawmakers of various political parties have

    <HEADLINE>TRAVEL AGENCIES MUST COPE WITH NEW REGULATIONS TO MONITOR TRAVELERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Travel agencies have no choice but to cope
with a new government regulation that requires travel agents to
report name lists of all Taiwan visitors heading to mainland China, a
spokesman for a Taipei-based travel agents association said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Taipei media reported Sunday that airlines and travel agencies
will be required to report to the Bureau of Exit and Entry the name
lists of mainland-bound visitors within 24 hours of their departure
as part of the government efforts to better monitor relations of the
people across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Wang Chi-han, chairman of the Chunghua Cross-Strait Travel Agents
Association, said he believes that local travel agents have no choice
but to follow the rule.</P>
      <P>Wang said similar regulations have been promulgated since 1997
after the government opened private visits to the mainland for
business purposes or to visit relatives. Nevertheless, the
regulations, requiring visitors name lists and itineraries to be
reported to the government within two years of the actual visits,
remain empty rules and have never been implemented, probably due to
technical difficulties, he added.</P>
      <P>A number of Taipei citizens, however, have different opinions on
the new regulation. They said that it would be a challenging task for
the government to have all mainland-bound visitors monitored since
Taiwan citizens make at least three million visits to the mainland
each year for either travel or business.</P>
      <P>In addition, they argued, it is the people's basic human right
stipulated by the Constitution to have the freedom to travel, and it
is improper for the government to monitor this.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEFENSE MINISTRY DENIES REPORT THAT MILITARY LEADERS OPPOSE REFERENDUM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense denied
Sunday that leaders of the armed forces did not support President
Chen Shui-bian's call for a referendum on Beijing's military threat
against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a response to a report in Sunday's United Daily News that said
22 of 24 generals interviewed by two correspondents of the paper had
said that they disapproved of the referendum proposal, a defense
ministry spokesman said the report was untrue.</P>
      <P>Gen. Chen Bang-chih, the chief of the Political Warfare Bureau
under the defence ministry, said at a news conference Sunday morning
that he personally contacted all active generals except for one who
was overseas after the report hit the stands and found they all
denied having given any interviews to the media regarding the
referendum.</P>
      <P>The chief of staff of the general who is out of the country
confirmed that no media had approached his boss over the referendum,
Gen. Chen said.</P>
      <P>The ministry also checked with all lieutenant generals and major
generals this morning and was sure none of them has ever talked to
any media over the referendum, Gen. Chen added.</P>
      <P>Without mentioning any media by name, Gen. Chen said the report
was not credible, far from the facts and groundless.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the defense ministry has ordered military
personnel to steer clear of politics and remain neutral in the
campaigning for the upcoming presidential election.</P>
      <P>The United Daily News said Sunday that its correspondents
interviewed two generals, 12 lieutenant generals and 10 major
generals. Twenty-two of them said that they did not support the
referendum called by President Chen. Two opted to keep their own
counsel.</P>
      <P>The story, bylined by two reporters, also said 20 of the
interviewees said "yes" when asked whether the referendum will
heighten tensions across the Taiwan Strait, two said "no, " and two
refused to comment.</P>
      <P>Sixteen of the 24 interviewed said they worried that the
longstanding confrontation between Taiwan and the mainland might
accelerate into conflict because of the referendum, four said Beijing
might up the military ante to a semi-military operation, such as
approaching the midline of the Taiwan Strait irregularly with fleets
of jet fighters or spying on Taiwan's eastern coastline with its
submarines.</P>
      <P>The article said the generals covered by the survey come from all
three branches of the military and 70 percent of them are commanders
of combat units, exercising considerable influence on the ministry's
policy-making, although they count for only 6 percent of the 400-odd
military generals.</P>
      <P>As being ordered to keep out of politics, the newspaper said all
of the interviewed generals said that they could give their opinions
only if they remained unnamed in the report.</P>
      <P>President Chen is calling for a referendum asking the people of
Taiwan if Beijing should remove the nearly 500 ballistic missiles
targeting the island. The move has been criticized by Chen's
political rivals at home as a campaign trick and has raised eyebrows
in Beijing, which is concerned that such a vote would be tantamount
to taking a step closer to declaring independence for Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OVER HALF OF TAIWAN PEOPLE DISSATISFIED WITH POLITICS: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A majority of Taiwan people are not
satisfied with either the country's politics or its economic
performance and nearly 70 percent of them said that pressure from
daily life has become greater than ever, according to the results of
a poll released Sunday.</P>
      <P>In its annual "state of the nation" survey, the prestigious
monthly CommonWealth magazine found that about 60 percent of Taiwan
people are dissatisfied with Taiwan's current political environment.</P>
      <P>Some 56 percent of the respondents blamed the struggle among
political parties as the greatest "crisis" that the Taiwan public is
facing, while 30.3 percent said media sensationalization has caused
Taiwan's politics to deteriorate, compared with 20.1 percent who
attributed lowering and changing social values as the reasons causing
the worsening political environment. Only 19 percent of the
respondents attributed Taiwan's political situation to a rising
mainland China and its military threats to the island, the poll
found.</P>
      <P>CommonWealth conducted the survey by telephone between Nov. 26
and Dec. 1, obtaining 1,074 valid answers from adults randomly
selected islandwide. It had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.</P>
      <P>The poll found that 67.8 percent of the respondents felt that the
pressures of life are mounting on a daily basis. About 56 percent
said the economy was the source of their pressure, while 15.7 percent
said chaotic politics was the reason.</P>
      <P>Some 57 percent said they are dissatisfied with the injustice of
society, while 74.8 percent blamed the gap between the rich and the
poor as the greatest social problem. Roughly 33 percent said they
were currently out of work, and 68.5 percent said they have been
worrying about losing their job, the poll found.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that a majority of Taiwan citizens are
dissatisfied with the political and economic environment, nearly 40
percent said they are optimistic about Taiwan's future, compared with
31 percent, who are pessimistic, according to the poll.</P>
      <P>In its December 2002 poll, CommonWealth found that 49.9 percent
of these responding said that they were pessimistic about 2003, up
25.5 percent from the previous year. The figure was only 15.3 percent
when the magazine conducted a similar survey a decade ago.</P>
      <P>The percentage of people who want to emigrate also declined in
the 2003 poll, with only 18.3 percent responding positively, a figure
slightly lower than that of 2002.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that 56 percent of the Taiwan public want to
see the status quo of the cross-strait relations remain unchanged.
Only 9.8 percent favor the notion that Taiwan unify with the
mainland. A total of 22 percent favor Taiwan's independence, while
3.9 percent are "extremely inclined toward independence." This figure
is the highest in five years.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that 43 percent of the respondents are
critical of the ability of the administration of President Chen
Shui-bian, who has ruled Taiwan for nearly four years, compared with
18 percent who said the Chen administration is capable. These
figures, nevertheless, are explicit improvements over those of last
year, when half of those polled rated Chen's government's performance
as "poor" and only 10 percent rated it as "good."</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINESE PREMIER FEARS IMPACT OF TAIWAN REFERENDUM ON MAINLAND: VP LU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's
opposition to Taiwan's referendum plan is because the Beijing regime
is afraid that such a democratic event could have a profound impact
on its power base, Vice President Annette Lu said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks at a campaign rally held in northern Taoyuan
County, where she once served as magistrate. The ticket of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) formed by President Chen Shui-bian
and Lu was formally ratified by the party congress a day earlier to
compete in the next presidential election set for March 20, 2004 for
a second term.</P>
      <P>Saying that the purpose of Chen's idea of holding a "defensive
referendum" on election day is to drum up international support to
ask Beijing remove its missiles aimed at Taiwan, Lu added that Wen's
opposition to Taiwan's planned referendum, made public during a
meeting last week with U. S. President George W. Bush at the White
House, is a result of Beijing's inability to prevent Taiwan from
holding the vote.</P>
      <P>Beijing is afraid of Taiwan's holding a referendum because it
fears that such a democratic practice will create leverage and cause
a split from mainland China in areas such as Hong Kong, Macau and
Xingjiang, the vice president said.</P>
      <P>Lu wondered why the U.S. president sent 300,000 troops to destroy
the weapons of mass destruction allegedly amassed by Iraq while
ignoring Taiwan's desire for peace when the island is targeted by 496
missiles deployed by Beijing.</P>
      <P>Bush's rebuke to President Chen's referendum plan has provoked
criticism from the U. S. political sector and the general public, Lu
stressed, adding that Taiwan will continue to make its stance clear
in this regard to have the international community be fully aware of
Beijing's intention to use force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president has done the right thing in initiating the
"defensive referendum" plan to protect Taiwan's status quo, she
pointed out.</P>

Monday via the direct "mini three links" route as part of his efforts
to promote crime-fighting cooperation across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen is among the 13 members of a delegation organized by the
Association of Friends of the Kinmen County Police. The mission,
headed by Lee Hsi-jung, includes several other senior and
middle-ranking Kinmen police officers.</P>
      <P>"We hope the visit will contribute to the establishment of a
Kinmen-Xiamen crime-fighting cooperative mechanism, " Chen said prior

      <P>Chen is the second Kinmen police chief to visit Xiamen since
Taiwan legalized direct trade, postal and shipping links between its
two frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu and mainland China's cities
of Xiamen and Mawei -- commonly known as "mini three links" -- on
Jan. 2, 2001 via the "mini three links" route. It took eight months
for Chen to complete the administrative formalities for his current

    <HEADLINE>ASHES OF FIVE DECEASED BURIED AT SEA UNDER AEGIS OF TAIPEI CITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After many twists and turns, family members
of five diseased individuals fulfilled the wish of their loved ones
for a burial at sea under a trial project promoted by the Taipei City
Government.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Government Bureau of Social Affairs Director Ku
Yen-lin apologized to the family members for the red tape involved in
the process.</P>
      <P>Ku said that the bureau had been too optimistic to think that as
long as the procedure was legal, no problem would arise, but the lack
of a deep sea port in Taipei caused trouble.</P>
      <P>Taipei City officials noted that the city is surrounded by Taipei
County, and that the Taipei City Government had originally hoped to
have the ship leave from Sanchi, Taipei County, but the application
was rejected by the county, mainly because the use of entertainment
ships for burials at sea are incompatible with their purpose of
seafaring and contradict management regulations.</P>
      <P>Although sea burials have been in use for years among the private
sector, the Taipei City Government was the first official agency to
advocate the environmentally friendly idea. The response was good
with one of the five deceased from four households coming from Taipei
and the farthest from Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>However, the scheduled time and venue kept changing Monday, and
the ritual was only able to be accomplished in the evening after
Taipei City Government officials and media withdrew from the process
and the final venue and ship owner were not disclosed.</P>
      <P>The Taipei City Government implored the Taipei County Government
not to prosecute the ship owners.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a liner that has cooperated closely with the Taipei
City Government took the initiative to call the city government to
say that if there is a big demand for sea burials, then the liner is
willing to be of service.</P>
      <P>The Taipei City Government said that the city government will
observe the situation to decide whether to continue with sea burials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-MADE PDAS ENJOY GOOD SALES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 15 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is expected to manufacture a total
of 6.18 million units of PDAs for the whole of this year,
representing a 1.5-fold increase year-on-year to account for about 50
percent of the entire world's production, an industry source said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Pang Shih-chao, deputy director at the Market Intelligence Center
under the Institute for Information Industry, estimated that
Taiwan-based contractors will put out around 6.18 million PDAs for
2003, thanks to handsome orders placed by top corporate clients such
as Palm.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's PDA production will continue to increase in the coming
four years at a slow pace of 5 percent growth per year, despite a
sluggish international demand for the hi-tech device since 2002, Pang
predicted.</P>
      <P>In an effort to catch up with the newest trends for sustainable
survival, Taiwan makers have to focus on diversification and more
durable products, Pang suggested. He forecast that advanced wireless
PDA modes featuring Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS and GSM/GPRS will prevail
in the global market from the second half of next year.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, many leading brand names are seeking to lower
their production costs and reduce their products' time to market to
cope with the market of conventional PDA products which have come of
age, he said.</P>
      <P>Out of such considerations to attract new customers for low-end
PDAs, Taiwan contractors are able to edge out foreign competitors to
gain orders from leading companies mainly because of their strong
research and development capabilities and high level of manufacturing
skills, he explained, noting that Taiwan has now become an
international production hub for PDAs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO ZERO-SUM GAME IN U.S. DEALING WITH CROSS-STRAIT AFFAIRS: MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene Chien
said Monday progress in Washington-Beijing relations doesn't mean a
retreat in Taiwan-U.S. relations.</P>
      <P>Chien made the remarks in a special report to the Legislative
Yuan's Foreign Affairs Committee on Taiwan-U.S. relations in the wake
of a meeting between U.S. President George W. Bush and mainland
Chinese President Wen Jiabao at the White House Dec. 9.</P>
      <P>Chien said Bush called mainland China a "diplomatic partner" in a
ceremony welcoming Wen, indicating close Washington-Beijing
interaction in the diplomatic arena.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chien said, the United States has traditionally
adopted a "parallel" approach, rather than a zero-sum game strategy,
in dealing with the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, he noted, advancement in U.S.-mainland
China ties doesn't necessarily mean a regression in Taipei-Washington
relations.</P>
      <P>Chien told lawmakers that Bush had unequivocally conveyed several
messages during Wen's first official visit to the United States,
including that the U.S. "one China" policy based on the
Washington-Beijing joint communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act has
remained unchanged; the United States does not support Taiwan
independence and is opposed to either side of the Taiwan Strait
taking unilateral action to change the status quo.</P>
      <P>In his view, Chien said, Bush's messages carried two purposes.</P>
      <P>"On the one hand, Bush reminded Wen that if Beijing uses force
against Taiwan, the United States would have to get involved. On the
other, Bush reminded Taiwan that the United States is opposed to
Taiwan taking any unilateral action to change the status quo, " Chien
explained.</P>
      <P>Touching on the U. S. concern about Taiwan's "defensive
referendum" plan, Chien said the two sides do not coincide in their
considerations.</P>
      <P>"While Taiwan considers the referendum issue from the perspective
of strengthening its young democracy and opposing mainland China's
missile threat, the United States is most concerned about maintaining
peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and easing cross-strait
tensions," Chien said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the United States has reaffirmed its security
commitment to Taiwan in the Bush-Wen meeting, Chien said the Bush
administration would not like to see any escalation of cross-strait
tension simply because of Taiwan's referendum, which might force
Washington to get involved in a cross-strait conflict.</P>
      <P>Chien said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will continue to
communicate with U.S. authorities through various channels. "We'll
convince U.S. authorities that the planned referendum is meant to
reinforce our democratic system and maintain peace and the status quo
in the Taiwan Strait."</P>
      <P>Chien said MOFA will do its utmost to put forth the point that
since the referendum will not touch on the subject of independence or
unification nor will it breach President Chen Shui-bian's promise of
not to change Taiwan's official name and national flag, it will not
violate U.S. strategic interests in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>MOFA will also seek to have the United States and the
international community understand that mainland China's insistence
on its "one China" and "one country, two systems" premises, as well
as its refusal to renounce the use of force against Taiwan and its
continued military build-up against Taiwan are the main obstacles to
resumption of peaceful cross-strait dialogue and the alleviation of
cross-strait tension.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  15 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's various political parties have
presented proposals to the Legislative Yuan, hoping that it will pass
a resolution urging Beijing to dismantle hundreds of missiles
targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , the opposition
Kuomintang and the People First Party each has their own proposal.</P>
      <P>The proposal from the opposition parties said that although the
two sides of Taiwan Strait have enjoyed economic and cultural
exchanges over the last 15 years, the military confrontation has
impeded the two sides from reaching detente. They also said that the
Republic of China (ROC) is a country with sovereignty and its status
should not be changed by outside force.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, mainland China's deployment of nearly 500 missiles
targeting Taiwan is not only a threat to the island, but also makes
the Taiwan Strait a hot spot in the Asia-Pacific region, the proposal
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan people hope mainland authorities do not deploy new
missiles targeting the island in the future, and desire that the
existing missiles be dismantled in phases to usher in an era of
reconciliation, the proposal added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the DPP proposal urged Beijing to respect the ROC's
sovereignty and Taiwan people's determination to pursue democracy and
peace.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan will make a final resolution Tuesday based
on these proposals.</P>

to Hussein's capture

The hunt for Saddam Hussein ended late Saturday with information
from a member of his tribal clan. At 8:26 p.m. Saturday, less than 11
hours after receiving the decisive tip, 600 American soldiers and
Special Operations forces backed by tanks, artillery and Apache
helicopter gunships surrounded two farmhouses, and near one of them
found Mr. Hussein hiding alone at the bottom of an eight-foot hole.
He surrendered without a shot. "He was just caught like a rat, " Maj.
Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, the commander of the Fourth Infantry
Division, told reporters at his headquarters in Tikrit on Sunday. "

The Wall Street Journal: Dramatic seizure changes reality from
Baghdad To the White House

The capture of Saddam Hussein by U.S. forcess ends a brutal era
of Iraqi history and gives a huge boost to the American occupation
and Iraqis who support it.

While the capture gives a huge political lift to President Bush,
it also injects new volatility into the fight against an increasingly
violent anti-American insurgency. Meanwhile, political forces inside
the country, ranging from Shiite Muslims in the south to the
U.S.-appointed Governing Council in Baghdad, have already stepped up
the intensity of their jockeying for power once the U.S. steps aside.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) promised
Monday to craft a mechanism to evaluate manpower agencies to
root out unscrupulous ones and rein in the steady rise in the number
of runaway foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>CLA Chairwoman Chen Chu made the promise during a Legislative
Yuan Budget Committee meeting where many lawmakers demanded the CLA
tighten management of labor imports and maintain job market order.</P>
      <P>Chen said the phenomenon of foreign workers absconding from their
jobs before the expiry of their work contracts can be attributed to a
combination of factors, including unfair treatment by employers,
exploitation by labor brokerages and personal relationships of
individual alien workers.</P>
      <P>Chen acknowledged that some unscrupulous manpower agencies have
earned illegal profits by recruiting runaway foreign laborers to work
as caregivers at local hospitals.</P>
      <P>Chen said the CLA is developing a viable system to evaluate
manpower agencies to prevent illegal activities by brokers
for runaway foreign workers.</P>
      <P>Moreover, she went on, the CLA has been carrying out a campaign
since September to repatriate runaway foreign workers in cooperation
with police authorities. Under the program, the CLA has asked foreign
labor supply countries to offer incentives, such as flight tickets
and cancellation of runaway records, to encourage absconded foreign
workers to surrender themselves.</P>

      <P>Thieves used the cover of an adjacent
construction site to make off with NT$27 million (US$793,814) from
the vault of a bank in Taipei City over the weekend.</P>
      <P>Clerks of the Wanhua Branch in Taipei City of the Hua Nan
Commercial Bank returned to work Monday morning to discover a 50
centimeter hole in the bank's vault and NT$27 million cash, an
undisclosed amount of U.S. dollars and U.S. travel checks missing.</P>
      <P>Police rushed to the scene only to find a knife and hundreds of
footprints and palm prints.</P>
      <P>They suspected a coordinated group was involved in the theft.
Entry appeared to have been made through a firebreak alley separating
the bank from an adjacent building which was undergoing construction.
The group had broken through three heavy iron grates to get to the
wall of the vault.</P>
      <P>Jackhammers must has been employed to break the hole since

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 15 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The charter plane service designed to make
it easier for Taiwan businessmen to return home from mainland China
for the coming lunar new year might not be profitable, despite better
conditions provided by Taiwan and mainland China this year to forge
agreement on the issue, business sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>It will be very difficult for any carriers planning to offer the
service to attract passengers now, as the traditional peak season is
fast approaching and tickets on cross-Taiwan Strait flights via Hong
Kong or Macau are already nearly fully booked, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that politics are preventing the two sides from
starting negotiations, the sources said the aviation companies are
waiting to see whether the political complications can be settled.</P>
      <P>Mainland China is willing to allow Taiwan-based carriers to
transport Taiwan businessmen from Shanghai, Beijing and elsewhere as
necessary during the period between Jan. 9 and Feb. 2, which
represents an increase of nine days over the year-earlier period.</P>
      <P>However, the political dispute makes it impossible for the
necessary negotiations to take place, the sources noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan insists that such talks must be held through
government-led channels, while the mainland stands firm on its
position that negotiations can be conducted by the private sector and
that mainland-based carriers must be allowed to participate in the
service.</P>
      <P>Last year, the historic charter flight services were not
profitable for the six carriers involved, including China Airlines
and Far East Air Transport Corp.</P>
      <P>With the Chinese new year just around the corner, aviation
companies have gone into full gear to offer additional flights on the
popular Taiwan-Hong Kong and Taiwan-Macau routes, coupled with
flights on the newly established routes through third locations such
as Japan's Okinawa and South Korea's Cheju.</P>
      <P>As many mainland-based Taiwan businessmen have already booked
their homecoming trips, the belated efforts to promote charter plane
services might prove unfruitful, the sources said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN CAN TAKE PART IN SUBCONTRACTING FOR IRAQI RECONSTRUCTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has not been included on a 63-nation
list unveiled by the United States that will be allowed to take part
in Iraq's reconstruction, but it will be allowed to take part in
subcontracting work, Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene Chien said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Chien made the remarks while fielding questions in the Foreign
Affairs Committee at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Bi-khim of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
asked why Taiwan, a staunch supporter of the U.S.-led war on Iraq in
March, was not included on the list, while Taiwan's ally Costa Rica
is on the list.</P>
      <P>Chien said the ministry contacted the nation's representative
office in the United States upon learning about the list, and the
representative office then contacted the U.S. Defense Department.</P>
      <P>The U.S. told the representative office that all 63 countries on
the list had joined the U.S. coalition or supported the U.S.-led
action in Iraq, while countries like Nicaragua and Honduras also sent
peacekeeping forces to Iraq.</P>
      <P>According to Chien, although Taiwan is providing humanitarian
assistance to Iraq, it is directed toward refugees and the country
has not sent troops to take part in the peacekeeping, hygiene or
construction works, which is why Taiwan is not on the list.</P>
      <P>But Chien said the U.S. stressed that the list is only for major
contractors and there will be no problem for Taiwan taking part in
subcontracting work.</P>
      <P>However, Hsiao noted that Taiwan strongly supported the U.S.-led
military operations in Iraq and that the legislative committee had
hoped that Taiwan could take part in post-war reconstruction.
It is hard to accept that Taiwan has been shut out of Iraq's
long-term reconstruction work, a move which also "falls far short of
the expectations of the committee," Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>She said that the Foreign Ministry should work toward soliciting
the right to take part in Iraq's reconstruction and should not allow
mainland China to use the referendum issue to mislead the United
States and undermine Taiwan's cooperation with the United States.</P>
      <P>Legislator Parris Chang of the DPP also said that Taiwan has
repeatedly told the United States that its holding of a "defensive
referendum" in March to coincide with the presidential election is
not an attempt to change the status quo, and he asked why the United
States is still "refusing to listen."</P>
      <P>Hsiao said that U.S. President George W. Bush's warning on
Taiwan's referendum plan shows a different perception of the issue
than Taiwan's and asked if this is a communication problem and the
result of sending the wrong messages.</P>
      <P>Chien said that Taiwan sees referendum as a move toward
strengthening its democracy, while the United States is focusing on
regional security and stability, which is two different stances. The
referendum idea is also a new issue that needs "more communication
and understanding," said Chien.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister said that after Bush's warning, Taiwan has
conveyed to the United States via various channels that President
Chen Shui-bian has no intention of changing the cross-Taiwan Strait
status quo, is not planning to hold a referendum on reunification or
independence, and does not want to affect the peace in the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>The United States, said Chien, is basically taking a "parallel
approach toward handling cross-strait relations, " which he said is
not a zero-sum game. Friendly relations between Washington and
Beijing do not mean a regression of relations between Taiwan and the
United States, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET UNVEILS YOUTH APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet unveiled a youth apprenticeship
program Monday as part of its efforts to help young high school and
college graduates land jobs.</P>
      <P>Under the program, the government will offer subsidies for local
companies to recruit 2,000 young graduates to work as apprentices.
The unprecedented program will call for an outlay of more than NT$100 million.</P>
      <P>Each youth hired under the program will be able to receive a
monthly subsidy of at least NT$8,000 and will work for up to six
months.</P>
      <P>The program was jointly organized by the Council for Economic
Planning and Development, the National Youth Commission and the
Council of Labor Affairs.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Lin Hsin-i said the program is designed to help
young graduates obtain work-based training as inexperience is the
biggest obstacle facing fresh graduates looking for work.</P>
      <P>"The program will also help narrow the gap between school
education and the expertise or skills needed by local enterprises, "
Lin said.</P>
      <P>Noting that about 66 percent of employees hired under the
government's NT$20 billion public service expansion programs were
middle-aged or elderly workers, Lin said the new youth apprenticeship
program will focus on helping graduates of senior high schools,
vocational schools and universities aged between 18 and 29.</P>
      <P>The National Youth Commission (NYC) has approved applications by
114 local companies to offer apprenticeship opportunities.
Among them are many noted information technology firms, including
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., as well as large
convenience store chains, five-star tourist hotels and banks.
They have offered a total of 3,918 apprenticeship vacancies.</P>
      <P>NYC officials said they hope that at least 50 percent of those
who are recruited under the apprenticeship program will land formal
jobs within a year after they finish the work-based training program.</P>
      <P>The officials encouraged hopefuls to apply for the apprenticeship
opportunities on the Internet (www.career.com.tw/speed/) . Each
hopeful can list up to five preferred choices, with successful
applicants set to begin work in January.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin said the jobless rate in November was 4.72
percent. "If the unemployment rate can drop to 4.52 percent for
December, then this year's jobless rate will fall below the 5 percent
mark, " Lin said.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan has many jobless people, Lin said, local companies
have 80,000 vacancies. "Relevant government agencies must work
closely to resolve this contradictory situation," he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian presided over a
recycled computers donation ceremony Monday, saying that he hopes
Taiwan can become not just an information giant but also "a country
with love."</P>
      <P>To reduce the digital divide between urban and rural areas and to
promote the idea of recycling, a campaign organized by the Office of
the President, the Cabinet-level Environmental Protection
Administration and the Research, Development and Evaluation
Commission, as well as the Institute for Information Industry, has
been under way for some time and has received an enthusiastic
response from the private sector. A total of 571 recycled computers
were collected under the campaign.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed gratitude to those who have donated these recycled
computers, which will be sent to several underprivileged groups
around Taiwan, including nursing homes for the elderly, elementary
schools in remote areas and rehabilitation centers.</P>
      <P>In the ceremony held at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, a group of
elementary students played music on recycled musical instruments,
wearing Christmas decorations made of recycled plastic juice bottles
and paper boxes.</P>
      <P>In September, Chen went to an elementary school in a remote area
of Taichung County to donate recycled computers and said at the time
that he was pleased to see that many students living in remote areas
have excelled in computer software design competitions.</P>
      <P>On Friday, Chen announced that the campaign results have so far
reached their targets and he urged the sponsors to continue the
donations as a way of expressing love to the underprivileged groups.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC DISMISSES SEF RESHUFFLE SPECULATION AS SHEER NONSENSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Tsai
Ing-wen ruled out the possibility Monday that the government will
reshuffle the quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and
appoint former President Lee Teng-hui as its chairman.</P>
      <P>Tsai was responding to a question from opposition People First
Party (PFP) Legislator Lee Ching-hua at a Legislative Yuan Interior
Affairs Committee meeting about the possibility of Lee replacing Koo
Chen-fu as SEF chairman.</P>
      <P>"The possibility is nil. The government doesn't have any plans to
reshuffle the SEF," Tsai said categorically.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the government highly respects Koo and treasures
the contributions he has made to the promotion of relations across
the Taiwan Strait since he assumed the post, Tsai said any
speculation about a shakeup of the SEF leadership is pure nonsense.</P>
      <P>"I don't think a senior lawmaker such as yourself should even
have bothered to raise the question," Tsai added sarcastically.</P>
      <P>The SEF is a semi-official intermediary body authorized by the
government to handle exchanges with mainland China in the absence of
official ties.</P>
      <P>Lee Ching-hua's PFP colleague, Legislator Sun Da-chien, brought
up the issue for the first time at a meeting of the Legislative
Yuan's Foreign Affairs Committee earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>While questioning Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene Chien, Sun
claimed that the U.S. reaction to President Chen Shui-bian's plan to
hold a "defensive referendum" on Beijing's missile threat to Taiwan
on the day of the next presidential election was partly prompted by
another of Chen's plans -- namely to invite former President Lee, an
outspoken critic of Beijing's military threat toward Taiwan and a
strong advocate of Taiwan's separate identity, to serve as the new
SEF chairman.</P>
      <P>In addition, Sun alleged that Chen will urge Beijing to allow its
quasi-official Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait to
resume dialogue with the SEF under the premise of "one country on
each side of the Taiwan Strait."</P>
      <P>Chien declined to respond to Sun's question, on the grounds that
mainland affairs are none of his business.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), a pro-independence
party which names Lee as its "spiritual leader, " dismissed the PFP
lawmakers' speculation as a ploy to drive wedges into the "pan-green
camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, the TSU and other
pro-independence groups.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Kuan-yu, director of the TSU's social development
department, said Lee would be unlikely to take any post in an
official or quasi-official agency. "Lee is now focusing on promoting
Taiwan's transformation into a full and normal democratic country, "
Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>Hsiao claimed that the PFP lawmakers deliberately fabricated the
SEF reshuffle report in an attempt to undermine Chen's re-election
bid.</P>

      <P>On business environment outlook, Taiwan was listed as "very good"

      <P>The number of Vietnam-bound travelers from
Taiwan has increased significantly recently, with most
airlines making additional flights or using larger aircraft to serve
the additional passengers, who include Vietnamese brides and workers
living in Taiwan, according to sources within the travel industry.</P>
      <P>The number of travelers from Taiwan to Vietnam reached 220,000
last year, which was not considered a high number. However, with the
increase of the number of Vietnamese brides and workers in Taiwan, as
well as businessmen and Vietnam-bound U.S. tourists making flight
transfers here, most of the six major domestic and Vietnamese
carriers serving the route have reached full occupancy.</P>
      <P>Although the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
earlier this year in Taiwan badly affected Taiwan's tourism,
Vietnam-bound travelers in the first 11 months registered a similar
level as in the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>China Airlines and EVA Airways have already increased their
flights to serve the increasing number of passengers, while Far East
Air Transport and UNI Airways plan to follow suit.</P>

      <P>The Public Service Pension Fund (PSPF) run
by the Ministry of Civil Service outsourced a total of US$500 million
Monday to five international asset management firms for overseas
investment.</P>
      <P>The Management Board of the PSPF forged contracts with Barclays
Global Investors Ltd., State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co., J.P. Morgan
Investment Management Inc., UBS Global Asset Management (Singapore)
Ltd. and Allianz Dresdner Asset Management of America L.P. in a joint
signing ceremony held at the Examination Yuan, becoming the first
government fund in Taiwan to undertake overseas discretionary
operations.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the contracts, each of the five international
asset management companies will be allocated an outsourcing fund of
US$100 million for a tenure of two years, while Citibank has been
awarded the custodian contract for overseas investment, for a tenure
of four years.</P>
      <P>In an address at the ceremony, Examination Yuan President Yao
Chia-wen said the five firms were selected and contracted in
accordance with the government's outsourcing policy and in a move to
improve asset management expertise, diversify investment risk and
implement asset allocation in order to increase investment profit.</P>
      <P>According to Minister of Civil Service Wu Rong-ming, an
evaluation panel comprising scholars and experts took over two months
to verify the management plan proposals, including 12 for
international indexed equity mandate, 14 for the international
balanced mandate and six for custodian, which were submitted by the
candidates from 26 asset management companies and six custodian
banks.</P>
      <P>Based on a short-list drawn up from the results of oral

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei City Government implemented a
temperature-taking policy Monday as part of efforts to ward off a
possible resurgence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).</P>
      <P>Any person visiting Taipei City Government offices or city
government-run medical facilities is now required to have their
temperature taken upon entry, Taipei City Department of Health
officials said. Those who are discovered to have a temperature of 38
degrees Celsius or higher will be denied entrance and advised to see
a doctor, they added.</P>
      <P>Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who had his temperature taken upon entering
his office Monday, called for all Taipei citizens to develop the
habit of taking their temperature on a daily basis and washing their
hands frequently to help wipe out the virus that causes the disease.</P>
      <P>The temperature-taking policy was implemented on the
recommendation of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) under Taiwan's
Department of Health and in line with similar measures put in place
by schools in Taipei from Monday.</P>
      <P>The CDC last week advised schools and education institutes of all
levels as well as private businesses and organizations to kick off
the temperature-taking policy Monday as a nationwide SARS prevention
and control campaign restart.</P>
      <P>Local health officials are on their guard against SARS, one of
whose early symptoms is fever, as winter is the peak season for the
flu.</P>
      <P>Taipei was the hardest hit area in the SARS outbreak in Taiwan
between March and July of this year. Two hospitals in the city were
forced to close during the height of the outbreak because of
cross-infection of the disease within the hospitals.</P>
      <P>SARS claimed the lives of 37 of the 346 people who were infected
with the disease in Taipei, and took a heavy toll on the country's
economy before it was contained in July.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a CDC official said at the Legislative Yuan that
medical supplies for use in SARS prevention and treatment are in
sufficient stock.</P>
      <P>CDC Chief Secretary Chen Ying-hui said that as of the end of
November, the country's stock of SARS related medical materials
included 19.59 million regular surgical masks, 4.81 million N95
masks, 3.51 million anti-SARS medical outfits and more than 2,000
negative-pressure-ward beds, enough to be used by the general public,
health care workers and patients for 40-59 days if SARS strikes
again.</P>
      <P>He added that the CDC has also signed contracts with private
companies for extra supplies if the need arises.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN REITERATES ITS SUPPORT FOR DOHA ROUND TRADE TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva, Dec. 15(CNA)
(By Neil Lu and P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior Republic of China trade official
in Geneva on Monday reiterated the nation's position in support of
the multilateral trading system of the World Trade Organization (WTO)
and the Doha Round trade negotiations.</P>
      <P>Yen Ching-chang, Taiwan's permanent representative to the WTO,
expressed clearly Taiwan's position while making an official
statement at the WTO General Council Meeting, which is being held in
Geneva to discuss issues related to the process of the Doha Round
trade negotiations.</P>
      <P>In the statement, Yen not only voiced Taiwan's support for an
early resumption of the Doha Round trade talks but also suggested
that the WTO should reform its mechanism as well as strengthen the
function and authority of its secretariat and director-general.</P>
      <P>Well-placed sources in Geneva have said that based on the
principle of trade liberalization, Taiwan will support getting the
Doha Round trade talks back on track but will also stand firm in
protecting Taiwan farmers' interests in the sensitive WTO
agricultural trade negotiations.</P>
      <P>WTO General Council Chairman Carlos Perez del Castillo has
actively conducted intensive consultations with different negotiating
groups and governments of main WTO members during the past two months
in order to re-establish the momentum and confidence in the Doha
Round talks after the Cancun Ministerial Conference ended
inconclusively in September.</P>
      <P>Indicating in a report he made at Monday's General Council
meeting, Castillo said that after two rounds of consultations, "there
is a strong sense of commitment to the multilateral trading system
and the Doha Development Agenda, and also of willingness to move
forward.'</P>
      <P>However, he also that "we have witnessed little real negotiation,
or movement towards accommodation among the different positions, or
searching for common ground, with some limited but welcome
exceptions."</P>
      <P>"Gaps remain wide, not only among the different positions but
also between generalized statements of commitment, engagement and
flexibility on the one hand, and any concrete manifestation of those
statements in negotiating positions on the other," he added.</P>
      <P>While pointing out that all the members have a strong willingness
to resume the Doha Round trade talks, WTO Director-General Supachai
Panitchpakdi also said at the meeting that the most important thing
is to turn that willingness into action.</P>
      <P>Of the 39 member states that have made statements at the meeting,
most of them, including the United States and the European Union,
have clearly expressed their position of support for the resumption
of the Doha Round trade talks at the beginning of next year.</P>
      <P>The goal of the current General Council meeting is to end the
deadlock in the Doha Round and to have the negotiations continue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP VIEW OF TAIWAN ISSUE COINCIDES WITH THAT OF U.S.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian was quoted as
saying at a meeting of his ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Tuesday that the party's view of the Taiwan issue coincides with that
of the United States.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to play down the differences between his government
and the United States over his call for a referendum, Chen was cited
by DPP member Kao Chih-peng as saying that the remarks made by U.S.
President George W. Bush after his talks with Chinese Premier Wen
Jiabao had two points -- that neither side of the Taiwan Strait
should change the status quo unilaterally and that Beijing
should not try to sort out its differences with Taiwan by force.</P>
      <P>Chen reportedly told his DPP comrades that he fully supports
Bush's views and that his call for a referendum urging Beijing to
stop aiming missiles at Taiwan is designed to send a message to the
world that Taiwan is determined to maintain the status quo in terms
of its ties with Beijing and to prevent it from being changed
unilaterally with coercion.</P>
      <P>According to Kao, who was present at the meeting, Chen said that
the United States has stood by Taiwan during its democratic
development and should not stand in the way of a referendum that will
cement the country's democracy.</P>
      <P>Concerned that Chen is using the referendum to justify his
attempts to separate from China, the United States has warned Taipei
in no uncertain terms against pushing the envelope, but Chen has
refused to budge. Instead, he has gone to great lengths to assure the
United States that his referendum will reinforce the status quo
rather than upset it.</P>
      <P>Kao said that many of the top-level DPP members at the meeting
shared the president's view, but felt that Taiwan should make greater
efforts to get the message across.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait will
resume talks after the next March 20 presidential election, an
official of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) predicted Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA, SEF Secretary-General Hsi Hwei-yow
claimed that the stalemate between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
is not due to a lack of communication channels and that the
resumption or otherwise of cross-strait talks is a strategy used by
Beijing to deal with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Beijing will believe that it is better to hold talks with Taiwan
than to allow cross-strait relations to remain idle after the
presidential election, according to Hsu, who added that the two sides
will drift farther apart without talks.</P>
      <P>The SEF, a semi-official organization in charge of dealing with
mainland China in the absence of normal relations between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait, and its mainland counterpart -- The
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait -- will continue
to be the pivotal bodies for cross-strait talks in light of the fact
that Beijing continues to transmit its opinions on cross-strait
issues to Taiwan via the SEF, he said.</P>
      <P>Hsu also suggested that the regulations stipulated in the Statute
Governing the Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the
Mainland Area should be flexible because they involve many political
factors and considerations.</P>

      <P>The average ratio of non-performing loans

in October, with six banks of the 53 banks evaluated reaching a
credit card NPL rate higher than 20 percent.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the Bureau of Monetary

credit card issuing banks, four suffered a credit card NPL rate of
between 10 and 20 percent; 15 banks registered a NPL rate of between
5 and 10 percent; and 28 banks registered a NPL rate of under 5

      <P>BOMA deputy director Chang Ming-tao said that those banks that

      <P>Taiwan hopes to form joint medical teams
with the United States to offer medical aid to countries that do not
maintain diplomatic ties with the Republic of China, Department of
Health (DOH) Minister Chen Chien-jen said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen said he had discussed the initiative with relevant U.S.

      <P>"I told American officials that Taiwan is willing to use
that hospital to help train medical professionals for other West
African countries in AIDS treatment and prevention," Chen said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The New Zealand Transport Accident
Investigation Commission has concluded that pilot error was the cause
of a Singapore Airlines plane mishap in New Zealand earlier this
year, the commission announced Monday.</P>
      <P>Singapore Airlines has accepted the findings, which pinned the
blame on three of its pilots.</P>
      <P>The mishap occurred at Auckland Airport on March 12 when an SIA
plane's tail caught fire after being damaged and dragged along the
runway during takeoff. The plane then made an emergency landing. None
of the 369 passengers or crew were hurt.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the first officer on Flight SQ286 made a
mistake in flight calculations when he keyed into the flight computer
a weight figure 100 tons lighter than the plane's actual weight. And
the captain of the Boeing 747 did not realize the mistake.</P>
      <P>In a statement, SIA added that the emergency procedures followed
by the pilots led to the aircraft returning to Auckland safely. It

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) will
have a new home in four years that will be able to withstand a
magnitude-7 earthquake, a senior official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lt. Gen. Pang Yu-tung, director of the MND's Armament Bureau,
told a regular news conference that construction of the ministry's
new complex will get underway Thursday on the site of what was
originally the Armed Forces University in Taipei's suburban Tachih
district.</P>
      <P>Defense Minister Tang Yiau-min will preside over a groundbreaking
ceremony Thursday, Pang said. Construction is scheduled for
completion in 2008.</P>
      <P>According to Pang, the new compound will not only accommodate MND
units but also the Air Force General Headquarters, which is now
located on Jen-Ai Road in downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>Pang said the 19-hectare MND complex, which carries a price tag
of NT$13.3 billion, will house three steel buildings plus several
other facilities.</P>
      <P>The buildings will be designed to withstand blasts and magnetic
pulse warfare attacks, as well as a magnitude-7 earthquake, Pang
said.</P>
      <P>Compared with the Pentagon, home to the U.S. Defense Department,
Pang said the new MND complex will occupy a better strategic location
as it is located on a hillside. Moreover, he added, the new complex
will be in the vicinity of the maximum-security Hengshan military
command center. He said the MND might also emulate the Pentagon by
installing anti-bombing equipment at the new complex.</P>
      <P>For years, Pang said, various MND units have been housed in
different areas around Taipei. Noting that the arrangement is
inconvenient for peacetime work coordination and could hinder wartime
military command and control, Pang said the MND began to plan a new
complex back in 1998, with the approval of the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>"As the new complex will accommodate both the MND and the Air
Force General Headquarters and is close to the Navy General
Headquarters, we believe the inauguration of the new complex will
help enhance MND operational efficiency and save resources, " Pang
said.</P>
      <P>In addition to three main buildings and a barracks, the new
complex will also have two large squares that can be used as
helipads.</P>
      <P>Once the complex is completed, a large number of officers and
enlisted men will work and live in the region, bringing lucrative
business opportunities to the Tachih district, commercial sources
said.</P>

      <P>The Department of the Health (DOH) urged
the public Tuesday to practice safe sex to avoid being infected with
the virus that causes AIDS.</P>
      <P>Lin Tin, deputy director-general of the DOH Center for Disease
Control, made the appeal in a press conference at Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport, Taiwan's gateway to the world, to highlight
the safe sex campaign.</P>
      <P>Lin said that as of the end of November, 5,125 people in Taiwan
were infected with the incurable disease, 16 percent of whom admitted
that they had solicited prostitutes. Of this 16 percent, 48.8 percent
paid for sex in East Asia or Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the global number of AIDS patients increases by 5
million per year, with Southeast Asia the area of fastest growth.
To date, more than 70 million people around the world have AIDS
and more than 30 million have died. Every year, there are around 3
million new AIDS fatalities.</P>
      <P>The Beijing authorities estimate that in mainland China, the
number of AIDS patients is around 850,000 and predict that the figure
could reach 10 million by 2010, he said.</P>
      <P>He noted that more than 7.319 million Taiwan people traveled
overseas last year, 39.2 percent of whom passed through Hong Kong and
20.6 percent of whom passed through Macau. Those passengers often
continued on to the mainland.</P>
      <P>He urged the public to be on their guard and to wear condoms
during sex, warning that up to 10 percent of sex workers in Guangxi

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economic prospects will improve
next year and economic growth is expected to reach 4.12 percent,
according to an estimate by the Taiwan Research Institute (TRI).</P>
      <P>Wu Tsai-yi, a section chief at the TRI, said Tuesday that if the
ten major construction projects planned by the government are
approved by the legislature, the public and private investment will
represent a major stimulus to the economy.</P>
      <P>As the unemployment situation cannot be addressed in short term,
the TRI set next year's unemployment rate at approximately 5 percent,
but said the growth in domestic consumption is expected to reach 3.04
percent thanks to the economic recovery at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>With regard to private investment, which is expected to suffer a
negative growth of 3.4 percent this year due to various
uncertainties, the country will see an 8.4 percent growth in private
investment next year once these uncertainties are cleared up after
the March 20 presidential election, according to TRI officials.</P>
      <P>As the economy emerges from the shadow of the U.S.-led war on
Iraq and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks, and
boosted by global economic recovery, the growth of Taiwan's exports
is expected to reach 8.75 percent in 2004.</P>
      <P>The TRI also predicted that low interest rates will last for a
while until the unemployment situation improves. The Central Bank of
China has been keeping interest rates low through market manipulation
to ensure sufficient capital supply, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>According to the TRI estimate, economic growth this year will
reach 3.12 percent and that in the four quarters of next year, they
will be 4.02 percent, 4.53 percent, 4.12 percent, and 3.79 percent,
respectively.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REVISED CINEMA LAW  TO GIVE SHOT IN ARM TO SAGGING MOVIE INDUSTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 16 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A revised cinema law aimed at giving a shot
in the arm to the depressed local movie industry passed its final
reading in the Legislative Yuan Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Notable among the changes are incentives to encourage companies
to invest in the motion picture industry by crediting their
investment against their business income tax. The tax break will be
valid for five years after the revision takes effect.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the revised law obliges the government to help the
cinema industry when its survival is threatened by imports of foreign
movies, such as setting up a fund to offer aid to its workers,
marking off theaters for the exclusive screening of domestic movies,
or setting a ratio of domestic films to foreign films to be screened
at theaters.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's domestic movies accounted for 6.73 percent of all movies
shown in the country last year and were attended by only 2.21 percent
of all moviegoers.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  16  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese spouses of Taiwan
residents can apply to work if they have been victims of domestic
violence and have obtained a protection order from a court under a
new ruling, the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) officials said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the regulations governing work permits and
management of mainland Chinese spouses during their stay in Taiwan,
mainland Chinese spouses can stay for six months if they apply to
visit Taiwan. If they want to extend their stay, they will have to
apply to the Bureau of Immigration.</P>
      <P>The regulations also stipulate that mainland Chinese spouses,
when apply for work permits, will have to show their papers allowing
them to stay and documents that prove that their Taiwan husbands are
either low-income, physically or mentally disabled, or afflicted with
a major illness.</P>
      <P>The Council of Labor said that in addition to the above
documents, another document -- which is the protection order from a
court -- will also enable abused mainland Chinese spouses to work
during their stay in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>CLA officials noted that as of the end of October this year, more
than 13,000 work permits have been issued to mainland Chinese spouses
and they mainly work in the service, wholesale or retail sectors and

    <HEADLINE>BONA FIDE VISITORS TO GET VISA FACILITATION: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Overseas missions will facilitate the
issuance of visas to bona fide visitors and will only target those
who intend to work illegally under the cover of students for a more
rigorous screening, an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Kao An, deputy director-general of MOFA's Information and
Cultural Affairs Department, said that to encourage international
exchanges and foreign students to come to Taiwan to study, MOFA has
coordinated related government agencies to adopt a more convenient
visa issuing procedure since mid-term this year.</P>
      <P>In addition, Kao said that MOFA has since late last year begun to
learn related regulations by other countries governing visa issuing
to students, such as Canada, the United States, Britain, Japan,
Germany, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Singapore and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Kao said that some countries have been strict in issuing visas,
requiring the visitors to be full-time students.</P>
      <P>Kao said the issuance of visas by MOFA will not affect those who
are bona fide students, and that MOFA is also coordinating with other
government agencies to heed the needs of foreign students to create a
friendly environment regarding the visa procedure and the duration of
their stay.</P>
      <P>Larry Wang, director-general of MOFA's Department of European
Affairs, said that he knows 26 students from East Europe have come to
Taiwan to learn Chinese under a scholarship program, and eight Polish
students and 13 students from the Czech Republic have come to Taiwan
to learn Chinese under the scholarship agreement.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an official of MOFA's Bureau of Consular Affairs said
that rigorous screening of visitors aims to create a favorable study
environment.</P>
      <P>Kao Kuo-liang, a section chief of the Bureau of Consular Affairs,
said that currently foreign students apply to come to Taiwan in two
situations.</P>
      <P>The first is to apply to Taiwan's overseas missions with an
entrance permit issued by a Taiwan university or other necessary
documents. The missions will then review whether the visitor is bona
fide.</P>
      <P>Foreign students will have to get residence cards at their local
police stations.</P>
      <P>In the second situation, those who have obtained learning
certificates from centers or schools can apply to Taiwan's overseas
missions for a 60-day visitor visa. When the students enter Taiwan,
they will have to go to a police station to have their visas
extended, unless they have been marked that their visas are not to be
extended. Students can apply to the consular bureau for resident
visas after studying for six months.</P>
      <P>He said that if foreign laborers, maids and illegal workers
extend their stay under the cover of studying Chinese, they will not
only waste Taiwan's social resources, but will undermine a favorable
studying environment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ECONOMY SEEN TO GROW 4.26 PERCENT IN 2004</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy is expected to grow by
4.26 percent in 2004, given that the domestic economy has regained
momentum since the third quarter of this year, the Chung-Hua
Institution for Economic Research (CIER) reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The domestic economy gained 4.2 percent in the third quarter of
this year after it bottomed out from the economic downturn caused by
the U.S.-led war in Iraq and an outbreak of severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) earlier this year, said CIER President Chen Tian-jy.</P>
      <P>CIER researchers believe that the domestic economy will expand at
least by 4.26 percent next year judging by all relevant factors, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>The 2004 growth could even shoot up to 5.06 percent if the global
economy continues to grow steadily, Taiwan's politics and
cross-Taiwan Strait relations remain stable and no major natural
disasters or epidemics occur, Chen added.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, CIER researchers forecast that in 2004,
consumption in the private sector will grown by 3.06 percent, while
investment from the private sector will advance by 6.39 percent,
marking the first growth since 2001.</P>
      <P>In 2004, the Taiwan currency is expected to maintain a level of
around NT$33.80 to US$1, while the unemployment rate will be 4.87
percent, lower than the 2003 average of 5 percent, Chen added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO TIMETABLE ON CROSS-STRAIT POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS: KMT CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" has no
timetable on any changes in the political landscape across the Taiwan
Strait or the development of cross-strait relations, Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Lien Chan said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference for the media from home and abroad,
Lien said the "pan-blue alliance, " comprised of the opposition KMT
and the People First Party (PFP) , has always maintained that
upholding the status quo is the best policy on cross-Taiwan Strait
relations.</P>
      <P>Lien, the 2004 presidential candidate of the "pan-blue alliance,"
said his camp does not support either "extreme unification" of the
two sides of the Strait or any rash announcement of Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance, " however, is resolute in supporting
cross-strait dialogue in the hope that the two sides will begin
negotiations as early as possible on direct air and shipping links,
arms control and other relevant issues, Lien said.</P>
      <P>He also said he hoped that the two sides of the Strait will
continue to increase business and trade exchanges, while minimizing
military threats. Lien said that the "pan-blue alliance" agrees that
Beijing should dismantle the missiles targeting Taiwan and has
appealed to the leadership across the Strait in this regard several
times. Lien said that he does not think it is necessary for Taiwan
people to voice their opposition to mainland China's missile
deployment in a referendum vote as has been called for by President
Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>"If the result of a referendum is what everybody already knows,
the referendum is simply unnecessary," Lien stressed.</P>
      <P>On Taipei-Washington relations, Lien said that all
decision-makers in the " pan-blue alliance" believe that U.S.-Taiwan
relations are the most important among all of Taiwan's foreign
relations.</P>
      <P>Lien said if he and his running mate, PFP Chairman James Soong,
are elected president and vice president in the March 20, 2004
election, the "pan-blue alliance" will be a government that treasures
Taiwan-U.S. relations and will not make any rash moves or flip-flop
policy that would undermine the deep relationship that exists.</P>
      <P>However, Lien said that as a presidential candidate, he would
rather not waste time and energy talking about cross-strait
relations, which is an issue that is impossible to solve in the short
term. It is also unfair to ask the people to make decisions on the
highly thorny political issue in referendums, he added. On the
contrary, he said issues pertaining to people's livelihood and
welfare, such as unemployment, the domestic economy and social order,
are much more important issues for the "pan-blue alliance" to tackle.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, who is also
campaign manager for the "pan-blue alliance, " said at the news
conference that the cross-strait sovereignty issue is not something
for people in Taiwan to solve here and now.</P>
      <P>Since the issue should be left for posterity to solve, Wang said
that maintaining the status quo of cross-strait relations is the
safest and most practical policy.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Tuesday met
with a Thailand delegation of media and communication specialists and
expressed the hope that ministerial-level trade consultations between
Taiwan and Thailand can be held regularly.</P>
      <P>The president said that he was gratified to learn that a
ministerial consultation meeting between Taiwan and Thailand was
resumed last year after a hiatus of more than a decade. He also said
that he hoping that the meeting could be held like the ones between
Taiwan and other Southeast Asian country ministers which is held
regularly every year.</P>
      <P>The president also said that although Thailand signed an
avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of tax evasion
agreement with Taiwan in 1999, the agreements have yet to be put into
practice, which is a source of concern for many Taiwan businessmen,
the president said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the president said that Taiwan hopes to sign a
temporary admission agreement and fugitive exchange pact with
Thailand.</P>
      <P>The president cited figures to show how close exchanges between
the two countries have been, noting that between 1986 and 2002,
Taiwan invested up to US$10.6 billion in Thailand, becoming the
third-largest foreign investor in Thailand.</P>
      <P>The president also said that bilateral trade between Taiwan and
Thailand amounted to US$4.46 billion in 2002, with Thailand enjoying
a trade surplus of US$55 million.</P>
      <P>He said that Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Yi-fu visited
Thailand late last year to take part in trade consultations with the
industry minister in Thailand, which marked a resumption of meetings
that were last held in 1991.</P>
      <P>The president expressed the hope that the meeting will be held
regularly just as the ones between Taiwan and such Southeast Asian
nations as Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore and
Indonesia.</P>
      <P>The president also told his visitors that he was happy to have
the Taiwan government take part in a project over the past three
decades to help people in northern Thailand plant vegetables, fruits,
tea and aid with forestation to replace the original planting of
opium poppies and other narcotic plants.</P>
      <P>The president also expressed his appreciation for the
contribution to Taiwan by Thai workers, noting that they currently
stand at more than 110,000, or around 38 percent of all foreign
laborers in the country and they have remitted around US$900 million
every year back to Thailand. Taiwan appreciates all Thai laborers,
whose number has reached 660,000, who have worked in Taiwan, he
added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan people also made 720,000 visits to Thailand last year,
spending US$1 billion there, the president said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT URGED TO CONDUCT FOREIGN SPOUSES CENSUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Dec. 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Kaohsiung County Government official
urged the central government Tuesday to conduct a nationwide foreign
spouse census for reference in formulating social welfare policies.</P>
      <P>Wu Li-hsueh, director of the Kaohsiung County Government's Social
Affairs Department, said the number of Taiwan men married to foreign
women, particularly those from mainland China and Southeast Asian
countries, has been increasing steadily.</P>
      <P>And many children born to intermarried couples have entered
elementary school, Wu pointed out. "We need to learn more about these
schoolchildren's adaptability, parental care and study situation, "
she said, adding that the government should take an across-the-board
census on intermarriage families to serve as reference in formulating
welfare policies and measures.</P>
      <P>The southern Taiwan county of Kaohsiung alone now has more than
16,200 residents who are married to mainland Chinese citizens or
foreign nationals. Foreign spouses number nearly 5,000.</P>
      <P>"Initial surveys show that many foreign spouses residing in
Kaohsiung County are very young, experience language barriers and
have limited education," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Some foreign women who have married either poor or disabled men
or men over the age of 65 tend to run away from their families after
they obtain legal working rights, Wu said, adding that the phenomenon
has created serious child care and education issues.</P>
      <P>Wu said Kaohsiung County Government has organized special study
programs to help foreign spouses adapt to local society and lifestyle
as soon as possible. "The classes are opened in the Fengshan,
Kangshan and Chishan areas where many foreign spouses live, " she
added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, she urged relevant government authorities to rein in
manpower agencies specializing in mediating marriages between local
men and mainland Chinese or foreign citizens. "Over the years,
unscrupulous matchmakers have misled some local people into
perceiving intermarriages as business deals, " Wu said, adding that
the government should tighten management and supervision of manpower
brokerage houses.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court on Tuesday fined a
man for illegally hiring a Chinese woman to work in his home.</P>
      <P>The court said that the man, surnamed Chu, paid nearly NT$20,000
(US$588.23) monthly between May 13 and July 30 this year to the woman.
It fined him NT$30,000, with the option of performing community
service for NT$900 a day until the fine is paid off.</P>
      <P>The court said that Chu violated Section 4, Article 15 of the
Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area
and the Mainland Area which prohibits the hiring or keeping of
mainland Chinese citizens to engage in activities that are not
previously approved or are incompatible with the purpose of their
coming to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The punishment for violators is a prison term of up to two years
or a fine of up to NT$300,000, or both.</P>
      <P>However, the court, considering the fact that Chu had no prior
criminal record, that he hired the mainlander to take care of his
elderly mother who was disabled in a car accident and that he
cooperated with the police in the case, gave him a lenient sentence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ZEN MASTER TRAVELS TO MIDDLE EAST FOR PEACE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Zen Buddhist Master Sheng Yen of Taiwan
recently traveled to Israel and Palestine in an effort to help put an
end to conflict in the area by means of spiritual enlightenment.</P>
      <P>Traveling with some 20 world religious leaders, Sheng Yen, a
member of the 2003 World Council of Religious and Spiritual Leaders,
hoped to use the power of religion to bridge the differences between
the two sides who have been at odds for a long period of time,
officials from the Dharma Drum Mountain Buddhist Association (DDMBA)
in Taipei said Friday.</P>
      <P>During the week-long "spiritual journey" in the Middle East Dec.
9-15, Sheng Yen presented two words -- mercy and wisdom -- to the
Israeli and Palistinian people and political leaders as the keys in
the pursuit of peace, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen called for leadership in both Israel and Palestine to
use wisdom to work out solutions to their differences while
practicing mercy on all the peoples in the region regardless of their
political affiliation or religion so as to not let down the peoples
living in the "Holy Land."</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen and his party met with Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed
Qureia during a symposium held in Jerusalem Dec. 11. After hearing
Sheng Yen's preaching, Qureia reportedly applauded enthusiastically
and said to his aides that he looks forward to seeing Master Sheng
Yen's suggestions put into practice.</P>
      <P>At a colloquium held at the Israeli prime minister's office Dec.
14, Sheng Yen delivered a speech to ranking Israeli officials,
including Cabinet officials, parliamentary advisers, and government
consultants in news and religious affairs, according to the DDMBA
officials.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Sheng Yen quoted Islamic doctrine as stipulating
that Jihad -- or "Holy War" -- does not mean to strive to defeat
others, but instead to defeat one's own evil thoughts. "This is an
idea almost the same as the Buddhist concept of conquering the evil
in one's mind," Sheng Yen said.</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen said he hopes that all the followers of Islam, Judaism
or Christianity will reach out their hands to one another so that
world peace will prevail.</P>
      <P>Master Sheng Yen, author of many Buddhist books, both in Chinese
and in English, is respected in Taiwan, mainland China and around the
world. As a Zen master, his teachings emphasize that practitioners
should in their daily lives be constantly aware of the thoughts
circulating in their minds.</P>
      <P>Such awareness will allow people to simplify their minds and to
clearly perceive the changes in themselves and in their environment,
he explained. Wisdom is developed so that people may apply it in
their workaday lives to face themselves and to grow, and to dissolve
their attachments and enter into a state of "no-self."</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen has been actively engaged in inter-faith exchanges that
advocate and promote religious understanding. His involvement in such
global activities includes being a member of the 2003 World Council
of Religious and Spiritual Leaders and delivering the keynote address
at the 2000 Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual
Leaders in New York.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, he founded the DDMBA, which now has over one million
followers. In the United States, he has been teaching the
Buddhadharma since 1975, leading to the founding of two centers, one
in New York City and one in Upstate New York.</P>
      <P>After concluding the week-long journey in the Middle East, Sheng
Yen flew to New York Monday to continue his preaching in North
America, which will also take him to Vancouver, Canada, according to
the DDMBA officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOE TO ADOPT NEW MEASURES TO ATTRACT FOREIGN STUDENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) has
worked out a package of measures to attract more foreign citizens to
pursue advanced studies in Taiwan, a senior official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on international educational exchanges and
cooperation, Chang Chin-sheng, director of the MOE's Bureau of
International Cultural and Education Relations, said the MOE will
cooperate with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) in setting up a
"Taiwan Scholarship" in 2004 to encourage foreign students to pursue
advanced studies in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Our promotional goal is to raise the number of foreign students
studying in Taiwan to 15,000 in 2008 from slightly more than 7,300 at
present," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Some 1,200 foreign students are now pursuing formal academic
degrees in Taiwan, Chang said, adding that the government intends to
achieve a 15 percent annual growth rate in the number of foreign
students pursuing degrees in Taiwan. In terms of this growth rate,
the numebr will rise to 3,000 by 2008.</P>
      <P>At the moment, 6,048 foreign citizens are studying Chinese
language in Taiwan. "We hope to enhance the number by at least 1,000
annually in the coming five years and by 2008, the number of this
group of foreign students will rise to 12,000," Chang added.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the "Taiwan Scholarship" will be offered to
foreign students studying at local universities or graduate
institutes as well as those studying languages in Taiwan. Moreover,
he said, the MOFA will offer special purpose scholarships to foreign
students.</P>
      <P>Chang said the MOE will coordinate with noted local universities
in enticing foreign students to pursue advanced studies in certain
academic fields in which Taiwan enjoys a competitive edge, such as
electronics, electrical engineering, information technology,
biomedicine, business management, and the Taiwanese language and
culture.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chang said, the MOE will encourage local colleges
and universities to open English courses, hold Taiwan education fairs
in foreign countries, set up Taiwan education centers in selected
foreign countries, and offer updated information about Taiwan's
education facilities and development.</P>
      <P>The MOE will also assist local universities in setting up foreign
students service centers and in resolving housing problems for
foreign students.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday
his administration owes the country's civil servants for its success
in meeting the challenges but at the same time sided with opposition
parties in opposing expanding the pension system for career civil
servants to cover officials appointed for political reasons.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a ceremony to honor distinguished civil servants of

has made amid the challenges of an international economic slowdown
and capital flight to mainland China, adding that the civil servants
take the lion's share of the credit for this.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Civil Service Ministry under the Examination Yuan
was trying to extend by one year a 10-year-old law which gives
politically-appointed officials a pension for career civil servants,
the president said career civil servants are different from
politically appointed officials who usually step down with the change
of government and should not be eligible for perks reserved for
career civil servants.</P>
      <P>The ministry in charge with the pension system should not set up

      <P>Taiwan ratcheted up its guard against

    <HEADLINE>POLICE FINALLY BUST LARGE-SCALE SOFTWARE PIRATING RING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB)
said Wednesday they have foiled a large cross-border counterfeiting
ring in cooperation with Microsoft Corp. and law enforcement officers
in Hong Kong, mainland China and several other countries.</P>
      <P>CIB officials said the cross-border counterfeiting ring was
believed to be the largest production and distribution group of
pirated Microsoft software products ever uncovered.</P>
      <P>CIB investigators raided the ring's Taiwan base in Hsintien on
the outskirts of Taipei around Tuesday noon. Six suspects, including
the alleged mastermind of the ring's Taiwan operations, were
arrested.</P>
      <P>A large quantity of pirated Microsoft softwares, including the
Windows and Office series of products, as well as counterfeit goods
of other world-renowned brands such as EPSON and HP, were found
at the ring's warehouses in Hsintien and other places in the greater
Taipei area.</P>
      <P>Police said the ring was believed to have sold more than NT$50
billion worth of pirated Microsoft products around the world over the
past 10 years.</P>
      <P>The group's Taiwan mastermind, identified as Chen Tien-en,
allegedly had set up a company nominally to sell computer peripherals
through the Internet. In fact, the company set up
branches in mainland China's Dongguang, Humen, Shenzhen and
Shanghai and cooperated with optical disk producers in mainland China
and Hong Kong to manufacture pirated software and other related
products for sale around the world.</P>
      <P>Over the past decade, police said, the ring allegedly sold
pirated Microsoft goods via Hong Kong to Thailand, Canada, South
Africa, Paraguay, Brazil, India, Kenya, Great Britain, the United
States, Germany, Australia, Israel and Dubai.</P>
      <P>With information provided by Microsoft, law enforcement officers
in Taiwan, Hong Kong, mainland China, Canada, Brazil and India
simultaneously raided a total of 13 locations Tuesday to thwart the
ring's operations.</P>
      <P>CIB officials said the ring usually received orders, produced
pirated products and laundered money in different countries to avoid
investigations by law enforcement authorities of a single country.</P>
      <P>"For a single order, their operations could span three to five
countries, " a CIB officer said, adding that close international
cooperation is needed in fighting commercial piracy and protecting
intellectual property rights.</P>
      <P>Noting that the CIB has spent more than a month probing the case,
the officer said the raid signifies the government's determination to
wipe out commercial counterfeiting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MEMORIAL CONCERT HELD FOR IT INDUSTRY TYCOON IN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A memorial concert was held for Sayling
Wen, vice chairman of Inventec Group, who died of a cerebral
hemorrhage Dec. 7 after a stroke at the age of 55.</P>
      <P>Thousands, including family members, friends and government
officials, attended the concert held at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall
in downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>The hall was decorated with a large scroll that had one of his
famous quotes: "There is only one kind of people in the world and
they all need to be cared for" to portrait the man who had devoted
his life to the care of others and communities.</P>
      <P>Wen, born in an impoverished family in Taiwan, made his fortune
in his youth as one of Taiwan's first calculator makers and later
went on to become a pioneer of the islands's information technology
industry.</P>
      <P>But the rag-to-riches story did not stop there. He said that he
would no longer be a businessman after he turned 50 and he kept his
word, devoting more time to writing and education.</P>
      <P>His assistance to Huangyangchun, in Gansu province, is becoming
legendary. He set up a computerized network in the poor countryside
to help farmers sell their agricultural produce through the Net,
giving them needed income as well as confidence in bettering their
own lives.</P>
      <P>He also invested US$5 million to build a five-star, 150-room
hotel-like conference center in Huangyangchun, claiming that the
hotel would serve as a home away from home for business people. "Only
by attracting the rich to the poor area will it be freed from
poverty," he said at the time.</P>
      <P>Speaking in the memorial concert, Legislative Yuan Vice President
P.K. Chiang said that those who are both entrepreneurs and writers
are many, but those who love Taiwan as much as Wen are numbered.</P>
      <P>His aid in Huangyangchun, his promotion of information technology
to educate the young and help them to get out of poverty, as well as
his love for all extended to the other side of the Taiwan Strait, and
he will be long remembered, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Chiang said that Hsu Hsin-liang, former chairman of the
Democratic Progressive Party, once said that if a Nobel Peace
laureate is to be to a cross-strait figure, then Wen should be the
first one to be considered.</P>
      <P>Many of his peers, including Wen's National Taiwan University
classmate. Barry Lam, chairman of Quanta Computer, were choked with
emotion when they delivered their thoughts about how Wen had inspired
them during their life.</P>
      <P>"He spent his life caring for other people, " Lam said, adding
that he has had always harbored big ambitions, big plans and told
others to do their best to get the best results, which had become a
principle of Wen.</P>
      <P>Lien Chan, chairman of the opposition Kuomintang, lauded Wen for
setting up schools in mainland China and Malaysia to help
impoverished children, which is a spirit of Taiwan of "going all over
the world and caring for those throughout the world."</P>
      <P>Attending the concert were also James Soong, chairman of People
First Party, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, and heads of big computer
companies.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, mainland Chinese officials, including Chen Yunlin,
director of Taiwan Affairs Office of State Council, went to
Inventec's Beijing office to pay tribute to Wen for his contributions
to cross-strait trade cooperation and assistance to the development
of western mainland China.</P>

    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Dec.  17  (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The World Health Organization (WHO)
recognized Taiwan's handling of the latest severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) case Wednesday, saying Taiwan has adopted correct
measures in dealing with the incident.</P>
      <P>WHO spokesman for communicable diseases Iain Simpson made the
remarks after receiving a report from Taiwan that a medical
researcher has tested positive for SARS, the first case in Taiwan
since the flu-like virus was contained in late June this year on the
island.</P>
      <P>In addition to informing the WHO of the case, Taiwan's medical
authorities immediately put the researcher into quarantine and traced
all those who had come into contact with him.</P>
      <P>The patient is an army lieutenant colonel doing SARS research at
a military-run laboratory on the outskirts of Taipei. Taiwan's
Department of Health Minister Chen Chien-jen said the officer is
believed to have contracted SARS at work, probably when he was
destroying SARS samples after using them for experiments and analysis
around Dec. 5.</P>
      <P>Simpson said if the case is confirmed to be an isolated one that
occurred in an enclosed environment, the WHO will neither issue a
SARS-related travel advisory against Taiwan nor declare Taiwan as a
SARS-affected area.</P>
      <P>In September, a Singaporean medical research also contracted SARS
at work.</P>
      <P>Simpson said these two cases indicated the importance of
laboratory security. At a WHO-organized seminar on SARS prevention
held in October, the world health regulatory body called for
strengthening of security measures in laboratories around the world.</P>
      <P>Simpson said the WHO will keep close tabs on the development in
the latest SARS case in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REFERENDUM TO BE SCRAPPED IF BEIJING WITHDRAWS MISSILES: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said in a recent
interview with the Financial Times that if mainland China agrees to
withdraw missiles aimed at Taiwan and renounces the use of force
against Taiwan, a referendum planned for March 20 can be canceled.</P>
      <P>But he also stressed that if the mainland test fires missiles in
the runup to the presidential election set for March 20, then it will
be regarded as "provocation" and Taiwan will not rule out any
possibilities, including a change of the content of the referendum.
The interview was conducted on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen plans to hold a "defensive referendum" March 20 to coincide
with the election, to gauge public opinion as to whether the
government should demand that Beijing withdraw 496 missiles targeting
Taiwan and renounce the use of force against the country.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the referendum will go ahead even if the United
States is opposed to the idea, Chen described the referendum as a
"universal value " and "a basic human right," and he asked why the 23
million people of Taiwan should be deprived of this right.</P>
      <P>The president reaffirmed that he does not want the referendum to
raise the issue of sovereignty because of the "four noes plus one"
that he pledged in his 2000 inaugural speech.</P>
      <P>But he said the one precondition of the "four noes plus one" is
that Beijing must not use force against Taiwan. If they use force
against Taiwan, "then the pledges will no longer be valid. We do not
want to see this happen, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen's "four noes plus one" pledge is no declaration of
independence; no change in the country's national title; no inclusion
of the "state-to-state" description in the Constitution; no promotion
of referendum to change the status quo; and no abolishment of the
National Unification Council.</P>
      <P>Asked of Taipei's reaction if Beijing test-fires missiles during
the election period, the president said that it will be seen as
clearly "an attack" by the mainland.</P>
      <P>On the triangular relations between Taipei, Beijing and
Washington, he said that after the meeting between U.S.
President George W. Bush and mainland Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao in
the United States last week, the White House spokesman said that
U.S. policy toward Taiwan remains unchanged and went out of his way to
say that Bush told Wen during the meeting that if Beijing uses
force or coercion against Taiwan, "we'll be there."</P>
      <P>Chen noted that Bush said in October 2001 that the United States
will do "whatever it takes" to help Taiwan defend itself, and that
he said during his meeting with Wen that he does not approve of
either side of the Taiwan Strait unilaterally changing the status
quo.</P>
      <P>Chen reaffirmed that he has no intention of changing Taiwan's
status quo, but in fact wants to defend and maintain the status quo,
a point upon which both he and Bush are in agreement.</P>
      <P>He also said he would like to see improved relations between the
United States and the mainland, but does not want to see Taiwan's
interests used as leverage or the improved ties coming at Taiwan's
expense. He noted that the United States has promised that this will
not be the case.</P>
      <P>Touching on cross-strait relations, Chen said that polls have
shown that "Taiwan consciousness" is rising and that the ratio of
those who describe themselves as Taiwanese rather than Chinese has
surpassed 50 percent, while the number of those who support
independence has also increased.</P>
      <P>Even though cross-strait trade will become even brisker as the
the two sides drift further apart politically, the phenomenon will
not be contradictory, he said.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that if the mainland continues to increase its
missile deployment, it will only drive Taiwan further away and incite
antagonism from the Taiwan people who view the mainland as a "hostile
country."</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that Beijing's leaders will listen to the
23 million people of Taiwan and not listen only to what they want to
hear in Beijing's power center of Zhongnanhai.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOUR ALISHAN TRAIN WORKERS GET PRISON SENTENCES OVER MARCH CRASH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Chiayi,  Taiwan,  Dec.  17  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Four Alishan mountain train
technicians were given prison sentences Wednesday for the crashing of
a four-carriage train earlier this year that left 17 dead and 172
others injured.</P>
      <P>The Chiayi District Court in southern Taiwan sentenced Wen
Fu-ming, a train inspector, to three years in prison for his part in
the tragic accident.</P>
      <P>The court ruled that Wen was to blame for the accident as a
stopcock controlling the airbrake connection between the locomotive
and the passenger carriages had been inadvertently left closed.</P>
      <P>The train's captain, driver and co-driver -- Su Yin-fu, Tsai
Chen-sen and Liu Po-yueh -- were each given two-and-a-half-year
prison terms.</P>
      <P>Judges said all four men should be blamed for their failure to
exercise prudence in performing their duties. According to the court
rulings, all four committed offenses of involuntary manslaughter and
injury, as well as overturning a public transport vehicle. All of
them have been suspended from work since the accident.</P>
      <P>The train crash was the worst accident in the 92-year history of
the train service at Alishan, one of Taiwan's most famous mountain
resorts.</P>
      <P>The 72-kilometer alpine railway climbs from the subtropical zone
into temperate pine forests, crossing more than 80 bridges and
passing through about 50 tunnels. Its route includes a series of
dangerous switchbacks.</P>
      <P>The ROC government operates the train at an annual loss of about
NT$110 million (US$3.2 million), but has preserved the line because
of its historic interest and as a draw for tourists -- it is one of
only three of its kind left in the world.</P>
      <P>The Chiayi branch of the Taiwan Forestry Bureau (TFB) , which
administers the historic mountain railway, has so far struck
compensation deals with 171 victims and has paid out more than NT$178
million in damages.</P>
      <P>TFB officials said they are still negotiating compensation terms
with two other victims. Meanwhile, families of seven deceased victims
and several injured passengers have commissioned the Consumers
Foundation to file a group lawsuit against the TFB over the accident.</P>
      <P>The plaintiffs have demanded a total of NT$572.97 million in
damages, as well as punitive compensation from the TFB. The suit
marks the first time in Taiwan that a consumer protection
organization has ever filed a group suit against a government agency.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MILITARY SARS RESEARCH CENTER CLOSES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The laboratory conducting severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) research at the Institute of Preventive
Medicine Research (IPMR) of the National Defense Medical College was
closed down temporarily Wednesday after one of its researchers was
confirmed to have contracted the flu-like disease, military sources
said.</P>
      <P>With the closure of the lab, all SARS research work in the
military has also been halted, said Chang Sheng-yuan,
director-general of the Military Medicine Bureau under the Ministry
of National Defense.</P>
      <P>Also Wednesday, the Cabinet-level Department of Health announced
that all public and private laboratories conducting SARS research
should also shelve their operations with immediate effect.</P>
      <P>Health Minister Chen Chien-jen confirmed Wednesday that the
44-year-old male researcher, an army lt. col., had tested positive
for SARS.</P>
      <P>The officer -- the first SARS case in Taiwan since the last
outbreak was contained in late June -- has been transferred to the
Taipei Municipal Hoping Hospital, a SARS-designated institution, for
observation and treatment in a negative-pressure ward.</P>
      <P>Chen said the officer is believed to have contracted SARS at
work, probably when he was destroying SARS samples after using them
for experiments and analysis around Dec. 5. According to Chen, the
patient flew to Singapore with six laboratory colleagues Dec. 7. He
complained of fatigue and muscle pain Dec. 8 while in Singapore but
had no fever until the night of Dec. 10 after he returned to Taipei.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said that six of the patient's IPMR colleagues
were ordered to suspend work at the laboratory and start self-health
management at home for 21 days.</P>
      <P>The four family members of the officer are also starting
self-health monitoring at home for 21 days, although they have not
displayed fever or any other SARS-like symptoms, Chang added.</P>
      <P>According to officials from the Military Medicine Bureau, the
IPMR is one of the most outstanding biological research institutions
in Taiwan. Since the SARS outbreak that began in March, they said,
the institute has successfully discovered, from over 10,000 plants
and medications, at least four herbal and other medicine ingredients
that have been proved effective in containing SARS.</P>
      <P>The IPMR, located in a secluded area of Sanhsia, in Taipei
County, is the only top-grade P4 laboratory in Taiwan. P4 refers to
polymers, properties and polymerization processes and denotes a
laboratory able to work in the fields of chemical engineering and
chemical technology, among others.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, in addition to finding SARS remedies, the
IPMR has had excellent research results in other areas, developing
reagents that can identify whether suspicious powder contains lethal
anthrax spores in five to 15 minutes. "Both accuracy and sensitivity
rates of our reagents exceed 99 percent," Chang said.</P>
      <P>The IMPR assisted in anthrax spore testing when the United States
was hit by a spate of anthrax scares following the terrorist attacks
in New York and Washington Sept. 11, 2001.</P>
      <P>Since SARS hit Taiwan, the IPMR has been racing against the clock
to analyze the characteristics of the virus, Chang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT: NO IMPORTS OF MAINLAND CHINESE LABORERS DURING HIS TERM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said in central
Taiwan Wednesday that he will never allow domestic businessmen to
import mainland Chinese laborers and will never recognize diplomas
issued by mainland Chinese universities during his term.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he attended a campaign rally
in support of his re-election bid sponsored by the Nantou County
Workers' Union, which had expressed concern about unemployment.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he "has 100 percent confidence" about winning the
March 20 election, although he added that one should never let one's
guard down, as the election will be a crucial battle between the
advocacy of "one country on each side of the Taiwan Strait" against
"one China, " democratic reform versus the restoration of corrupt
"black gold" politics, and faith in Taiwan against pessimism about
the island.</P>
      <P>Addressing concerns as to when the economy will rebound, Chen
stressed that although Taiwan's economic growth of 3.59 percent last
year was "not satisfactory," it was "far better" than the 2.2 percent
growth in Singapore, 2.3 percent growth in Hong Kong and 0.3 percent
growth in Japan.</P>
      <P>Chen said that when he assumed office in May 2000, the global
economy was sluggish, but he noted that Taiwan has overcome the most
difficult times during past three years.</P>
      <P>He expressed confidence that economic growth next year will reach
5 percent, while the jobless rate will drop to below 4.5 percent,
dropping further to 4 percent in 2005.</P>
      <P>He said that to protect domestic laborers, he will not increase
the quotas for foreign labor imports and will never allow the import
of mainland laborers.</P>
      <P>He said he will also not recognize diplomas handed out by
mainland schools. "Taiwan will be first in everything," he added.</P>
      <P>Chen said that more bills concerning laborers were cleared during
his term, including the shortening of weekly working hours and the
five-day work-week system, and he claimed that "everything" is
improving and that the public should have confidence.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should consider using the
Philippines as a strategic production base for its manufacturing,
agricultural and fishery development, the ROC representative to the
Philippines said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Addressing a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs
Committee, Wu Hsin-hsing said Taiwan and the Philippines are close
neighbors and have traditionally maintained cordial economic, labor
and tourist exchanges.</P>
      <P>"In the future, I think our government should consider using the
Philippines as a strategic hinterland for our manufacturing,
agricultural and fishery industries, " Wu said, adding that by so
doing, Taiwan will be able to expand its national development and
further boost its relations with the Philippines.</P>
      <P>Wu said Taiwan-Philippine relations are not expected to see a
major breakthrough on the political front in the foreseeable future
due to Manila's "one China" policy which recognizes Beijing as the
sole ruler of China.</P>
      <P>However, Wu said the Philippines' pro-Beijing policy has not
hindered bilateral trade and economic cooperation. "And our
communication channels with the Philippines' administration are also
operating smoothly," he added.</P>
      <P>As to relations with the Philippine Congress, Wu pointed out that
the Philippine Senate and House of Representatives passed separate
resolutions in May in support of Taiwan's bid to join the World
Health Organization.</P>
      <P>"The moves indicate that the Philippine Congress is friendly
toward Taiwan," Wu said, adding that the ROC representative office in
Manila will continue to forge extensive ties with Philippine
lawmakers.</P>
      <P>In the future, Wu said, the representative office will also
invite as many influential Philippine politicians to visit Taiwan as
possible.</P>
      <P>Touching on fishery disputes between the two countries, Wu noted
that under Philippine law, fishing contracts signed by Philippine
local governments or fishery brokerage houses with private Taiwan
companies are invalid.</P>
      <P>Wu said he has asked domestic fishery administrative agencies to
step up a publicity campaign to help local fishermen better
understand the Philippine fishery regulations and thus avoid being
detained by Philippine authorities while operating in Philippine
waters.</P>
      <P>Acting on his suggestion, Wu said, the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture has sent a fishery expert to work at Taiwan's
representative office in Manila to assist with handling relevant
affairs.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, nine Taiwan fishing boats and 23 fishermen have
been detained by the Philippine authorities since 2002. Wu said that
all those ships have either been released or have escaped and only
two crew members are still pending Philippine court rulings.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is still negotiating a new fishery cooperation agreement
with the Philippines, as a previous accord has already expired.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SARS PREVENTION MECHANISM MOVES UP A GEAR TO LEVEL B</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) prevention mechanism has been geared up to Level B upon the
confirmation of the first SARS case reported in Taiwan this winter,
Health Minister Chen Chien-jen said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Priority missions to be made in the SARS prevention mechanism
Level B include making sure that the SARS virus is prevented from
being taken abroad, mandatory temperature-taking for people working
aboard airplanes, thermal monitoring at airports and travel
restrictions on those who have displayed fever or those who have had
personal contact with people who have displayed fever, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen also suggested that officials at public places begin taking
the temperature of people upon admission during the Level B period,
which will continue until Dec. 31.</P>
      <P>From Thursday, he said, passengers who display fever will be
prohibited from going abroad without producing proof that they are
not infected with SARS.</P>
      <P>Those who have had personal contact with confirmed SARS cases,
have displayed fever but are determined by the Department of Health
as non-SARS should conduct home quarantine for at least three days,
Chen added.</P>
      <P>The health minister confirmed Wednesday that a 44-year-old male
researcher with the Institute of Preventive Medicine of the National
Defense Medical College had tested positive for SARS.</P>
      <P>The patient -- the first SARS case in Taiwan since the outbreak
was contained in late June -- was transferred to the Taipei Municipal
Hoping Hospital, a SARS designated institution, for observation and
treatment in a negative-pressure ward.</P>
      <P>Chen said the researcher is believed to have contracted SARS at
work, probably when he was destroying SARS samples after using them
for experiments and analysis around Dec. 5.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the patient flew to Singapore with six
colleagues Dec. 7. He complained of fatigue and muscle pain Dec. 8
while in Singapore but had no fever until the night of Dec. 10 after
he returned to Taipei, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a China Airlines official urged the public not to
worry about contracting SARS from CAL airplanes, as the specific
passenger had not developed fever before, during or after he boarded
the plane.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER INSTRUCTS TRANSPARENT HANDLING OF LATEST SARS CASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyh-kun instructed relevant
health care agencies and professionals Wednesday to handle Taiwan's
first case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) this winter in
a transparent manner to avoid stirring up unnecessary public panic.</P>
      <P>Yu said he was informed by Minister of National Defense Tang
Yiau-min about the latest SARS case -- a 44-year-old male researcher
with the military-run Institute of Preventive Medicine who tested
positive for SARS -- early that morning and immediately relayed the
report to President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Yu instructed relevant health care agencies to spare no efforts
to look into contact history of the researcher and crank the SARS
prevention and treatment mechanism into high gear, said Executive
Yuan spokesman Lin Chia-lung.</P>
      <P>At a press conference held later that day, Health Minister Chen
Chien-jen confirmed that the researcher had tested positive for SARS.</P>
      <P>The patient -- the first SARS case in Taiwan since the outbreak
was contained in late June -- was transferred from the Tri-Service
General Hospital to the Taipei Municipal Hoping Hospital, a SARS
designated institution, for observation and treatment in a
negative-pressure ward, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen described the latest case as isolated, as the patient was
infected with the disease in a closed environment, namely a
laboratory. None of the researcher's colleagues or family members
have displayed fever or other flu-like symptoms.</P>
      <P>In addition to informing the World Health Organization (WHO) and
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum about the latest
SARS case without wasting time, Chen said, the Department of Health
has also instructed the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) to
organize a seven-member SARS investigation ad hoc group, headed by
NTUH Infection Department Director Chang Shang-chun, to keep close
watch against a possible resurgence of SARS.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the latest case, which closely resembles a case in
Singapore in September when a 27-year-old researcher with the
Singapore Environmental Health Institute laboratory contracted the
disease in the lab where he worked, has underlined once again that
biological research laboratories are one of the most dangerous places
from where SARS could resurface.</P>
      <P>However, he added that Taiwan should be spared from being issued
a travel advisory or warning by the WHO, given that this is an
isolated case with the victim contracting the disease in a closed
environment.</P>
      <P>The health minister called for the public not to panic, saying
that none of the researcher's colleagues or family members have
displayed fever or other SARS-like symptoms.</P>
      <P>These people, Chen said, are not required to be quarantined and
need only monitor their health condition by themselves at home.</P>

Chinese-Vietnamese language teachers in April 2004.</P>
      <P>The ministry will also cooperate with private groups in producing
relevant television teaching programs and posting foreign spouses
teaching materials on the Internet, Liu said.</P>
      <P>With the number of Taiwan citizens married to foreign nationals
increasing steadily, the number of schoolchildren from intermarriage
families has also risen.</P>
      <P>Quoting official tallies, the ratio of first graders from
intermarried families has surged from 5.12 percent to 12.46 percent
over the past five years, with the number rising from 13,940 to
30,833 in the current school year.</P>
      <P>In addition to helping these children adapt to school life, Liu
said, the MOE has stepped up adult education for foreign spouses
because they play an important role in schoolchildren's care and
family life.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liu said, the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) has drawn
up a five-year education plan for foreign and mainland Chinese
spouses. Under the plan to be carried out from 2004, the government
will spend up to NT$700 million on various adult education programs
for foreign and mainland spouses.</P>
      <P>According to MOI tallies, the number of foreign spouses had
reached 71,052 as of June, with Taipei County, Taoyuan County and
Taipei City as the top three areas of residence. Vietnam was the top
source of foreign spouses with 43,478, followed by Indonesia with
10,52, and Thailand with 5,861. Among the foreign spouses legally
residing in Taiwan, a total of 65,466, or 92.14 percent, are women.</P>
      <P>However, one unofficial tally showed that the number of foreign
and mainland spouses now stands between 250,000 and 280,000, with
about 100,000 from Southeast Asian countries and the remaining from
mainland China.</P>

      <P>Purchase delegations from Japan and Hong
Kong each have notified the China External Trade Development Council
(CETRA) that they have canceled their planned visits to an
agricultural product exhibition in southern Taiwan, CETRA said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chu Kang-ming, director of CETRA's Kaohsiung office, said that
the groups called Thursday to cancel their visits to the exhibition,
of which CETRA is a co-sponor, and expressed their hope of being able
to come next time if they have the opportunity.</P>
      <P>Chu said the purchase delegations did not explain the reason for
the cancellation, but he speculated that it may be related to the
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) case confirmed Wednesday in
Taiwan -- the island's first of the winter season.</P>
      <P>Chu said it was "regrettable" that Nihon Ryutsu Sangyo Co, a
purchase company set up by 19 supermarkets and wholesale stores in
Japan with global purchases amounting to US$2.1 billion last year,
abruptly canceled its planned visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The exhibition will be held in Kaohsiung Dec. 20-21, with more
than 200 pavilions to be set up. More than 1,000 agricultural

downgrade its ties with Taiwan if the country goes ahead with a

      <P>Adam Ereli, deputy spokesman for the State Department said that

      <P>He made the remarks after being asked to comment on reports from
Taipei that Washington, which opposes any attempt by Taiwan to change

      <P>There will be no rail workers strike during
the Lunar New Year holiday, a spokesman for the Taiwan Railway
Workers' Union announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>The union eventually decided not to go ahead with the planned

      <P>According to the spokesman, the MOTC has officially notified the
union of the Executive Yuan's assurance that the government will
fully meet their requirements if the union halts its plan to strike
during the year's busiest travel period.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) head Shu Ta-wen said railway
services during the holiday period will be further stepped up, with a
40 percent increase in transport volume, or an additional 500 trains
in service, now that the strike has been canceled.</P>
      <P>The union decided Sept. 11 to hold a strike over the Lunar New
Year holiday as to protest a government privatization plan for the
TRA.</P>
      <P>The MOTC has been negotiating with the union since then in a bid
to persuade its members to cancel the planned strike. With the
support of the Executive Yuan, the ministry gave way to the union
demands related to the privatization program, including a total
government takeover of the TRA's debts and all worker's pensions,

      <P>The ROC armed forces will respond to any
mainland Chinese military action in line with relevant combat
regulations, Defense Minister Tang Yiau-min said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Tang was responding to press inquiries about his views on
President Chen Shui-bian's statement in a recent interview with the
London-based Financial Times that if mainland China test-fires
missiles near Taiwan as it did in 1996, the missile tests would be
regarded as a provocation, an attack, and therefore contradict the
precondition of his "four noes plus one" pledge.</P>
      <P>Tang said the Ministry of National Defense (MND) is not in a
position to comment on Chen's remarks, as he is the top commander of
the armed forces.</P>
      <P>Noting that the military consistently monitors mainland China's
military activities closely, Tang said the military will take action
according to the nation's combat regulations to defend Taiwan in the

    <HEADLINE>CABINET TO INVESTIGATE EMBEZZLED NATIONAL ASSETS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun will preside over a
meeting of the National Property Management Commission next Wednesday
to look into national assets allegedly embezzled by political parties
or individuals, Cabinet spokesman Lin Chia-lung said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lin said Yu will ask various government departments, including
the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) , the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry
of the Interior and the Ministry of National Defense, to check and
tally assets they believe have been embezzled from their ministries.</P>
      <P>If necessary, Lin said, the government will form a
supraministerial task force to speed up the probe.</P>
      <P>Lin said legislation is the best way to deal with problem
regarding political parties' ill-gotten assets. However, he said, the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan has dragged its feet on
passing a Cabinet-drafted bill that would allow for the disbursement
of political parties' improperly obtained assets. Against this
backdrop, he said, the Cabinet must take action on its own account.</P>
      <P>Lin alleged that the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) embezzled a huge
amount of the country's assets during its 54-year rule of Taiwan. In
recent months alone, he said, the KMT has sold ill-gotten land
parcels and securities for nearly NT$240 billion.</P>
      <P>Noting that a land dispute between the state-run Central
Broadcasting System (CBS) and the KMT-owned Broadcasting Corporation
of China (BCC) highlights the problems of the KMT mixing up state and
party coffers while it was in power, Lin said the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) will assist CBS in filing a
misappropriation lawsuit against BCC.</P>
      <P>The CBS-BCC dispute started in 1952 when the MOTC bought two
parcels of land, totaling 10 hectares, in Minhsiung, Chiayi County
for NT$150,000. An additional NT$2 million was spent on radio
broadcasting equipment for CBS, originally a BCC subordinate
department, to continue its propaganda broadcasting to mainland
China.</P>
      <P>The land was registered under the BCC but has been used by the
CBS branch station in Minhsiung since then. CBS expanded in 1972 and
has become a state-financed institution.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the land belongs to the company, BCC started
demanding that CBS either return or rent the two parcels of land in
January 1998, but its requests were met with defiance. Last month the
Chiayi District Court ruled in favor of BCC, but CBS has vowed to
appeal.</P>

Order of Brilliant Star with Grand Violet Cordon Thursday on Shuzo
Ishikawa, a former senior advisor to Japan's Dentsu Inc., in
recognition of his remarkable contributions to technical exchanges
between Taiwan and Japan.</P>
      <P>Chen said he was very pleased to award the medal to Ishikawa at

in appreciation for his strong support for Taiwan over the years.</P>
      <P>Ishikawa, who also served in many key posts at the International

AFAA and its hosting of an annual conference after the island was

said he follows that path in both his private and professional life.</P>
      <P>Ishikawa attributed the international status achieved by Taiwan's
advertising industry to the diligence and endurance of the people
working in the sector and he also expressed admiration for the
efforts made by Hu Jong, president of the Taipei Association of
Advertising Agencies.</P>
      <P>As to his becoming the first-ever recipient of the Order of

      <P>Japan is still observing how the United
States is reacting to the planned referendum by Taiwan and is not
expected to express its stance on the issue any time soon, ROC
Representative to Japan Lo Fu-chuan said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Foreign
Affairs Committee, Lo said Japan would not like to see any conflict
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Up to now, Lo said, Japanese authorities have not yet expressed
its views on Taiwan's plan to hold a "defensive referendum" on the
day of the upcoming presidential election on March 20, 2004 to allow
its people to voice opposition to mainland China's deployment of
hundreds of missiles pointed at the Republic of China on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Unconfirmed reports said mainland China's embassy in Tokyo had
asked the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to publicly oppose
Taiwan's planned referendum.</P>
      <P>But Lo said Japan has so far not made any comments on the issue.
To the best of his understanding, Lo said, Japanese authorities
thought that the time was not yet ripe for them to express opinions
about the plan.</P>
      <P>Lo said Japanese authorities have also not discussed the
referendum issue with him. "I think they are still watching the U.S.'
attitude toward Taiwan's referendum plan, " he said, adding that the
U.S. government will certainly inform Japan of its stance on Taiwan's
planned referendum.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan, who is also the "pan-blue alliance's" standard-bearer for the
2004 presidential election, said Thursday that if he wins the
presidency, he will push for cross-Taiwan Strait armament control

      <P>Lien made the remarks while meeting with U.S. Congressman Dan
Burton, who arrived in Taipei last Tuesday for a goodwill visit.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People

hundreds of ballistic missiles along its southeastern coast pointed
at Taiwan, Lien said that if elected, he would demand mainland China
publicly renounce the use of force against Taiwan and conduct
armament control talks with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lien said mainland China's missile deployment has hurt Taiwan
people's feelings and would never contribute to cross-strait
rapprochement.</P>
      <P>He further said the top leaders of the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait should refrain from provocative rhetoric and actions because
such moves will only hinder cross-strait detente.</P>
      <P>Lien also told Burton that Taiwan treasures its long friendship

    <HEADLINE>SEVERAL SARS PATIENT CONTACTS STILL NOT TRACKED DOWN</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Authorities have still not been able to
track down several people who are known to have come in close contact
from Dec. 7 with the Taiwanese researcher diagnosed Wednesday with
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) , the Center for Disease
Control (CDC) reported Friday.</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-yi, deputy director of the CDC under the Cabinet-level
Department of Health, said those who came into close contact with Lt.
Col. Chan from the military Institute of Preventive Medicine (IPM)
include passengers seated near him on his flight to Singapore Dec. 7
and his return flight Dec. 10. He added that the passengers include
foreign and Taiwanese nationals.</P>
      <P>One of the passengers the center has not been able to track down
is Taipei County's Hung Chih-ming, 43, who was on the Dec. 10 China
Airlines flight to Taipei.</P>
      <P>The center has also not been able to get in contact with the
minibus driver who took Chan home from Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport Dec. 10, as well as with three patients who were at the
clinic that Chan went to in Hsintien, Taipei County, Dec. 11,
according to Shih.</P>
      <P>The CDC called for those people who came into close contact with
Chan to closely monitor their own health condition for at least 10
days.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chan has continued to receive medical attention in a
negative-pressure ward at Taipei Municipal Hoping Hospital.</P>
      <P>According to hospital authorities, the 44-year-old Chan has been
placed on artificial respirator since Wednesday. His fever has come
down and his diarrhea has been brought under control, but the
inflammation in his lungs has continued to increase, doctors said.</P>
      <P>The doctors said that they are closely monitoring the condition
of Chan's lungs, pointing out that the following three days are
extremely critical. The inflammation must be combated to prevent the
millions of tiny sacs in his lungs from becoming fluid-filled -- a
condition that bars oxygen from entering the lungs, they said.</P>
      <P>Chan is believed to have contracted SARS at work Dec. 5 when he
touched with his bare hand spilled SARS samples after analysis work
in SARS virus research.</P>
      <P>He flew to Singapore for an academic conference along with five
co-workers Dec. 7 and began to feel fatigue the next day while in
Singapore but did not develop a fever which is typical of SARS.</P>
      <P>Chan returned to Taiwan Dec. 10, and by that night had developed
a fever of 38.5 degrees Celsius. His wife took him to see a doctor
near their house in Hsintien the next day. At that time, nobody
suspected him of having SARS, even though his job involved working
with the SARS virus.</P>
      <P>Another full week was allowed to pass before he was sent to
hospital Tuesday after developing diarrhea. At the hospital, Chan
underwent tests that confirmed the SARS virus was present in his
system.</P>
      <P>Others who have been told to closely monitor themselves for signs
of fever include the patient's family as well as medical workers at
the clinic in Hsintien, Shih added.</P>

was overseas on vacation.</P>
      <P>However, they managed to win over the support of seven
independents and defeated the request 118 to 95.</P>
      <P>Jubilant opposition lawmakers claimed it was a victory for the
people because they scuttled the Executive Yuan's attempt to nix the
newly created right of referendum.</P>
      <P>KMT whip at the Legislative Yuan Lee Chia-chin urged the
Executive Yuan to stop its fruitless political struggle with the
Legislative Yuan now that it has exhausted all avenues to kill the
Referendum Bill and devote its energy to implementing the bill
faithfully.</P>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun kept a stiff upper lip after the vote
although he said earlier in the day that he will not step down even
though the request was rejected. He warned that the ill-thought out
bill could hardly be put into practice even the legislature stands by
it.</P>
      <P>Not surprisingly, the ruling DPP lawmakers were disappointed with
the result. Party whip at the Legislative Yuan Chen Chi-mai said the
DPP will address the flaws in the bill either by amending the
Constitution, revising the Referendum Bill after it takes effect or
asking the Council of Grand Justices to determine whether the bill is
unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>The DPP's political ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), said
the rejection is a setback for the country's democracy. It brought
home to the public the need to reform the legislature, which is
controlled by the opposition, and which has become the biggest source
of disturbance in the country.</P>
      <P>The Referendum Bill at the center of the controversy is the
brainchild of the DPP, but the opposition at the legislature
outmaneuvered the ruling party by packing it with their own ideas and
steamrolling it through the legislature on Nov. 27.</P>
      <P>The disappointed Executive Yuan decided to ask the legislature to
reconsider 12 of the 64 articles of the bill last Thursday, calling
them unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Notable among them were articles giving the Legislative Yuan the
power to initiate referendums while denying the Executive Yuan a
similar right, and articles providing for the formation of a
referendum review committee which would duplicate the function of the
existing Central Election Commission.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng said the Executive
Yuan's request is unprecedented in that it challenges only part of
the bill and in some cases, even only a section of an article.
"Usually, we are called upon to deal with a whole article rather than
a section of it, " Wang said,</P>
      <P>Under the Constitution, the part of a bill returned by the
Executive Yuan will be automatically annulled unless the Legislative
Yuan rejects the request within 15 days with a majority vote of at
least 112 in the 223-seat legislature.</P>

The Wall Street Journal: After huge raid on illegals, Wal-Mart
fires back at U.S.

In a series of predawn raids on Oct. 23, federal agents rounded
up 250 illegal immigrants working as cleaning crews in 61 Wal-Marts
across 21 states. Twelve federal agents also descended on Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. offices in Bentonville, Ark. Brandishing a search
warrant, they made off with 18 boxes of documents from the company's
operations department.

Now Wal-Mart is opening up a new battle with the government over
the raids. Wal-Mart says managers at many levels knew about the
problem of illegal workers in its stores, because they had been
cooperating for as long as three years in federal investigations in
both Pennsylvania and Chicago.</TEXT>

    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Dec. 19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung District Court on Friday
called the two parties involved in a custody battle over a
Taiwanese-Brazilian boy to discuss ways to have the boy sent back
Brazil as ordered by a recent court decision, but the talks fell
through.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Supreme Court ruled on Nov. 13 that the grandmother
was the sole legal guardian of eight-year-old Iruan Wu Ergui, who is
currently living with his Uncle, Wu Huo-yen, in Kaohsiung, southern
Taiwan. The court ruled that the boy should be turned over to the
custody of his grandmother in Brazil.</P>
      <P>Upon learning of the Nov. 13 ruling, the grandmother, Rosa
Leocadia Silva Ergui, said that she would not come to Taiwan to pick
up the boy to avoid unnecessary media attention, which she said would
be bad for the boy and the families in Taiwan and Brazil. Instead,
she entrusted the Brazil Business Center, which represents Brazilian
interests in Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties, to
escort the boy back to Brazil.</P>
      <P>The lawyer representing the Brazil Business Center requested
Friday that Wu Huo-yen take the boy to the CKS International Airport
within one week so that the boy can return to Brazil to be reunited
with his grandmother.</P>
      <P>But Wu said that if the boy, whose Chinese name is Wu Yi-hua, is
unwilling to return to Brazil, he would rather accept punishment,
even if that means going to the jail instead of sending him away.</P>
      <P>He said that he will talk to the boy, insisting that the boy's
"wishes and decisions should be respected, " and he wants the boy to
remain in Taiwan. Wu expressed the hope that the grandmother could
come to Taiwan and respect the choice of the boy.</P>
      <P>The lawyer representing Wu said that Wu will soon again appeal to
the court to stop the forceful implementation of the court's ruling.</P>
      <P>The lawyer said that even if Wu receives the order of forceful
implementation, Wu has said that he just couldn't bring himself to
let the boy go.</P>
      <P>According to the law, if the quarreling parties refuse to come to
a mutually agreeable solution, the court can fine Wu, and if he
refuses to pay, the court can take away the boy. The court will make
a definite decision very soon.</P>
      <P>Iruan was born in Brazil to a Brazilian mother and a Taiwanese
father. His mother died six years ago and he was brought to Taiwan in
March 2001 by his father, who died a couple of weeks later. Since
then, the boy has been living with his uncle. He is now a
second-grader at a Kaohsiung elementary school.</P>
      <P>His grandmother, who became the boy's legal guardian after his
mother's death, decided to take legal action to regain custody of the
child after his uncle in Taiwan refused to let her take him back to
Brazil.</P>

      <P>Serum extracted from the blood of 31 former

contagious diseases had donated blood for research and SARS
antibodies were found in 31 of the serum samples.</P>
      <P>As the antibodies are a valuable weapon in treating the disease,
researchers have been eager to test it in clinic trials. However, the
disease disappeared in Taiwan after July, making it impossible to
find test subjects, said the official.</P>
      <P>The latest SARS patient confirmed Wednesday has been treated with

      <P>An official in charge of mainland China

      <P>Chen Ming-tong, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council

    <HEADLINE>SEF TO ASK FOR QUICK RESPONSE FROM ARATS ON CHARTER PLANE SERVICES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  19  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice
Chairman Chen Ming-tong said Friday that the MAC has demanded that
the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) contact its
mainland Chinese counterpart regarding the opening of talks on
charter plane services during the lunar New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>The MAC hopes that the Beijing-based Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) will respond quickly, Chen said,
adding that he strongly believes that the two sides can work out
resolutions as long as both are sincere in dealing with the matter.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks came after the local press reported that the MAC
was trying to persuade six Taiwan-based carriers to conduct the
charter flight services for the coming Chinese New Year holiday that
they offered a year ago.</P>
      <P>According to the MAC, the six airlines -- China Airlines, EVA
Airways Corp., Far Eastern Air Transport Corp., Trans Asia Airways,
Mandarin Airlines and UNI Airways Corp., -- have shown a willingness
to cooperate with the plan, despite the fact that the historic
operation to transport homecoming mainland-based Taiwan businessmen
and their families for the holiday was not profitable last time.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Airline Association issued a statement a day earlier
in which it stressed that every aviation company is willing to do its
best to help carry out the plan, as long as Taiwan businessmen's
groups based on the mainland or travel agencies in Taiwan indicate
the need for such services during the period from Jan. 9 to Feb. 2.</P>
      <P>However, an official of the association said the demand for
cross-Taiwan Strait charter flight services during the holiday period
is not very high, as not a single aviation company has submitted an
application to provide the service.</P>
      <P>In addition to some extra flights added to normal commercial
flight services, newly opened charter plane services between Taiwan
and mainland China through a third location such as Japan's Okinawa
or South Korea's Cheju would help cope with the busy traffic during
the period, as do the existing "mini links " between Taiwan-held
Kinmen and Matsu islands and two ports in mainland China's Fujian
Province, he added.</P>
      <P>The SEF, set up in 1991 to handle cross-strait civilian exchanges
in the absence of government-to-government contacts, is under the
auspices of the MAC -- Taiwan's highest government agency with regard

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN NEEDS TO DEVELOP PRE-EMPTIVE MISSILE ATTACK ABILITY: DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A report said Friday that Taiwan must
establish a pre-emptive missile attack ability as the military
balance of the Taiwan Strait is gradually tilting toward mainland
China.</P>
      <P>The report conducted by the Institute for Taiwan Defense and
Strategic Studies, a private research institute, also predicted that
the next cross-strait war will be between 2005 and 2010.</P>
      <P>Chen Chung-shin, director of the Department of China Affairs of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , claimed that the
report, drawn up at the commission of his department, is the "most
comprehensive" report on mainland Chinese military force by the
private sector, which does not include reports by the Ministry of
National Defense and national security authorities.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Beijing currently deploys 450
short-range ballistic missiles along the coast of Fujian Province, a
number that is expected to increase to 650 by 2005. Beijing also
deploys cruise missiles that can reach their chosen targets in seven
minutes, giving Taiwan only five minutes to respond.</P>
      <P>The reports also said that in addition to the development of its
own J-10 second-generation fighter planes, Beijing has also purchased
advanced fighters such as the Su-27 and the Su-30 from Russia, and is
expected to deploy 130 and 150 of these fighters, respectively, by
2005.</P>
      <P>This, together with the mainland's H-6 bombers, means that Taiwan
will gradually lose its air supremacy, the report claims. It will
only take 17 minutes for Beijing fighters to take off from coastal
areas of Fujian and reach Taiwan, giving the country only five
minutes to 15 minutes to respond.</P>
      <P>On the mainland's navy, the report said that Beijing is building
its own battleships and has also purchased four modern destroyers
fitted with supersonic anti-ship missiles, C-802 anti-ship missiles,
as well as Kilo-class submarines which posed a great threat to
Taiwan's second-generation battleships.</P>
      <P>More importantly, according to the report, Beijing has learned
from the U.S.-Iraq wars and has since 1994 gradually established a
rapid deployment force that is expected to reach 500,000 strong,
which together with its naval and air forces, could pose a major
threat to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The report claims that Beijing will launch a seven-minute blitz
attack on Taiwan to paralyze its command and control system and
obtain air supremacy in 17 minutes. As for how many hours it would
take to parachute in military forces and how many days it would take
to exclude the intervention of the United States, this would hinge on
the military might of Taiwan and the response time of the United
States, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Wen-chung of the DPP noted that growth in mainland
China's defense spending has exceeded double digits for the 10th
consecutive year. The United States has estimated that mainland
military expenditure is US$20 billion annually, but if military
budget under other names is also counted it could reach up to US$60
billion. While the annual defense budget of Taiwan is only US$8
billion a year, half of this is in personnel expenditure.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the mainland deploys 496 short-range missiles
along its coastal areas, but according to studies by the United
States, the number has been increasing by 65 annually, and this does
not include the m-missiles and cruise missiles.</P>
      <P>In the long-run, Taiwan will be unable to compete with the
mainland in the arms race, Lee claimed.</P>
      <P>"Faced with the military imbalance in the Taiwan Strait, " Lee
said that Taiwan should adopt a two-pronged military and non-military
approach.</P>
      <P>He said that military approach means that Taiwan should research
and develop pre-emptive missiles. The non-military approach will be
to demand that Beijing withdraw its missiles aimed at Taiwan through
a "defensive referendum, " drawing the attention of the international
community so as to put political pressure on Beijing.</P>

      <P>Taiwan hopes that the Macau authorities will set up an office in
Taiwan to handle stepped-up bilateral relations through
institutionalized channels on a mutually beneficial basis amid
increased civilian exchanges, the MAC said in a statement. The MAC is
Taiwan's highest policy-planning government agency with regard to
mainland China.</P>
      <P>The MAC hailed the good performance of the Macau government over
the past year, evident in that the economy, law and order and the
judicial system in the former Portuguese enclave has remained sound
and stable.</P>
      <P>The role played by Macau as a broker in trade and economics in
interrelations with the western part of mainland China's Guangdong
Province, as well as with the Portuguese-speaking countries and
overseas Chinese businessmen, is increasingly noticeable, the MAC
said.</P>
      <P>Affected by the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) in the first half of this year, the number of visitors
traveling between Taiwan and Macau during the January-November period
dropped, according to the MAC.</P>
      <P>It said Taiwan people paid a total of more than 768,000 visits to
Macau, down by 34.86 percent from the year-earlier level, although
Taiwan is still Macau's third-largest source in terms of foreign
arrivals.</P>
      <P>According to the MAC, the Macau office it opened Feb. 27 this
year to handle entry visas and travel permits for local residents,
foreigners and mainland Chinese people is operating smoothly and has
earned a positive response.</P>

Medical College, via computer and offered his greetings to the
patient, who contracted SARS after handling virus samples with bare
hands in blatant disregard of the strict rules of the facility in
which he worked.</P>
      <P>The 44-year-old Chan, who has been receiving treatment in a
negative-pressure ward at Hoping Hospital since Wednesday, told Ma
that he feels OK and that he appreciates "all the people for their
concern."</P>
      <P>Ma conducted the talks with Chan during an inspection tour of
Hoping Hospital, now a SARS designated hospital after being the
hardest-hit by SARS among all Taiwan's medical institutions in the
outbreaks that occurred between March and July this year.</P>
      <P>Ma expressed his appreciation to all the health care personnel at
the hospital, particularly those who have been working at the A9
Negative-Pressure Ward, raising their spirits while they treat what
is described by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) as "an isolated"
case that is unlikely to lead to more transmissions of the virus.</P>
      <P>According to Hoping Hospital authorities, Chan has been on
artificial respirator since Wednesday. His fever has come down and
his diarrhea has been brought under control, but the inflammation in
his lungs has continued to increase, doctors said.</P>
      <P>The doctors said that they are closely monitoring the condition
of Chan's lungs, pointing out that the following three days are
extremely critical. The inflammation must be combated to prevent the
alveoli -- millions of tiny sacs in his lungs -- from becoming
fluid-filled, a condition that stops oxygen from entering the
bloodstream, they said.</P>
      <P>Chan is believed to have contracted SARS at work Dec. 5 when he
touched spilled SARS samples with his bare hands after analysis work
that was part of SARS virus research at a top-level P4 laboratory in
which the use of gowns and gloves is mandatory. It was not clear why
Chan had decided to break the rules and not wear gloves.</P>
      <P>He then flew to Singapore for an academic conference along with
five co-workers Dec. 7 and began to feel fatigue the next day while
in Singapore, but did not develop the fever which is typical of SARS.</P>
      <P>Chan returned to Taiwan Dec. 10, and by that night, had developed
a fever of 38.5 degrees Celsius. His wife took him to see a doctor
near their house in Hsintien the next day. At that time, nobody
suspected him of having SARS, even though his job involved working
with the SARS virus.</P>
      <P>Another full week was allowed to pass before he was sent to
hospital Tuesday after developing diarrhea. At the hospital, Chan
underwent tests that confirmed the SARS virus was present in his
system.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT GIVES UP BUILDINGS, THEATERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 19 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) announced
Friday that it was relinquishing ownership of two major buildings and
seven movie theaters in Taipei City as part of efforts to clear its
name in the wake of a spate of criticism of the party for embezzling
national assets.</P>
      <P>Chang Che-sen, director-general of the KMT Administration
Management Committee, claimed that most of the party's assets -- many
of which are described by party rivals as "ill-gotten assets" -- were
"a historical legacy" that have made significant contributions to the
country.</P>
      <P>However, despite reluctance, the KMT has since last year
continued to give up these assets and return property to their
original "donors," Chang said.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, KMT Chairman Lien Chan announced in September
last year that the party would undertake a sweeping consignment of
party assets back to their former owners in an effort to recuperate
some of the former ruling party's image and dignity.</P>
      <P>Lien said that a total of 120 land lots and 42 buildings would be
returned to their former owners, mostly local governments around the
island that gave the property to the KMT as donations in the years
when the KMT reigned.</P>
      <P>The assets consignment, the first of its kind in the KMT's
history, is estimated to be worth over NT$900 million (US$26.47
million).</P>
      <P>Immediately after making the announcement, Lien told his fellow
party members that the KMT would push the Party Law legislation,
accelerate measures to put other KMT-owned assets and operations into
public trust, and make sure that the party never again owns or
engages in any profit-making businesses.</P>
      <P>Lien further claimed that the KMT has lost its power but not its
self-confidence.</P>
      <P>As of the end of August, according to Chang, 120 out of the 165
land lots that the KMT had been using had been returned to their
original donors, constituting a completion rate of over 80 percent.</P>
      <P>In related news, the legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party recently rebutted a KMT claim that it had returned
all of its ill-gotten assets to the nation.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Chou Ya-shu accused Lien of lying when he claimed
Dec. 1 that his party had returned all of its ill-gotten assets to
the nation and had entrusted the party's legal assets to professional
trust companies.</P>
      <P>"When the KMT was in power, it embezzled vast amounts of national
property. Lien should honestly face up to his party's past sins and
stop cheating on this issue, " Chou said, adding that the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party, which
controls a majority in the Legislative Yuan, should support the
passage of a bill that would legalize investigations into the assets
of major political parties.</P>
      <P>Another DPP legislator, Lai Ching-teh, said that the KMT's
controversial assets could be divided into four categories --
property taken over from the Japanese colonial government at the end
of World War II, such as the building of the Broadcasting Corp.
of China; property taken from the government, including 19
theaters, 11 of which were sold secretly by the KMT; 115 pieces of
land given by city or county governments; and property that the
government sold to the KMT at unreasonably low prices, such as the
KMT's present headquarters.</P>
      <P>"Among all these assets, the KMT has only returned about half of
the 115 pieces of land presented by local-level governments, " Lai
claimed.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen Chi-mai, also a DPP legislative whip, said the
KMT should explain why it has so far only returned half of the land
lots donated by local-level governments and why it has dragged its
feet on handling other illegally obtained assets.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Ho Shui-sheng from the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) offered his apologies to Taiwan's
homosexual citizens twice Friday for his remarks made the previous
day that "same-sex marriages could cause the annihilation of the
nation."</P>
      <P>At two separate press conferences at the Legislative Yuan, Ho,
who represents Tainan County, bowed to express his apologies to the
public as well as the nation's gays and lesbians for his "wrongly
understood" remarks.</P>
      <P>Ho said he didn't mean to hurt gays and lesbians when he made the
remarks while speaking to Health Minister Chen Chien-jen about the
possible passage of a bill allowing for same-sex marriages. Ho said
he simply expressed his opposition to same-sex marriages from the
medical point of view.</P>
      <P>Ho, a member of the Legislative Yuan Health and Environment
Committee, urged the public health officials not to allow marriages
between gays and between lesbians, saying that such marriages should
be prohibited because they could never produce offspring which are
needed for the nation's sustainable development.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, the DPP lawmaker had refused to apologize for his
remarks as he criticized the media for "wrongly decoding and
reporting" his comments made at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Scores of gays and lesbians staged a protest against Ho Friday
morning in front of the Legislative Yuan building.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Chi-mai, a DPP party whip at the Legislative
Yuan, said that Ho's remarks will discussed at a DPP caucus meeting
next Monday and that it will be decided then whether to discipline Ho
under the DPP's regulations.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Ho's controversial remarks, Vice President Annette
Lu quoted the content of the pending basic human rights draft bill as
stipulating that it recognizes, maintains and respects the
relationships between people of opposite-sex or same-sex as basic
human rights. The rights include the right to marry and the right to
adopt children.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT STRESSES THE IMPORTANCE OF JOINING WHO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 20 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Jumping at the chance to gain some leverage
from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) case in Taiwan,
President Chen Shui-bian stressed in Taipei Saturday the importance
of Taiwan obtaining access to the World Health Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>Speaking at a ceremony to honor senior medical workers, Chen said
the reappearance of SARS in Taiwan has reminded the world of the
loophole in its anti-epidemic frontline caused by Taiwan's absence
from the WHO, which coordinates the global efforts to fight
epidemics.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan succeeded in overcoming the disease earlier
this year on its own, Chen said the episode brought home to both the
international community and the country that epidemics know no
political boundaries and that the world's attempts to bring epidemics
under control are hampered by shutting Taiwan out for political
reasons.</P>
      <P>Now that the disease has reappeared in Taiwan due to the
negligence of a scientist engaged in SARS research that caused him to
become infected by the disease Dec. 17, the president said the case
serves as a warning to both the world and the country that Taiwan
should be included in the WHO as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>He vowed to continue the country's seven-year effort to join the
WHO as an observer, saying that persistence will eventually lead to
success. He also wished the latest SARS patient a speedy recovery.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's previous bids to join the WHO have been blocked by
mainland China, which claims sovereignty over the nation and goes out
of its way to isolate Taiwan at every opportunity.</P>
      <P>About 200 senior medical workers were honored in Saturday's
ceremony and the president awarded medals to several who boasted
careers of more than 60 years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CANDIDATE PLEDGES TO INCREASE EDUCATIONAL SPENDING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec 20 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) presidential
candidate Lien Chan said Saturday that he will increase educational
spending in the public sector to 6 percent of the gross national
product (GNP) if he is elected in March.</P>
      <P>Lien, who is also the KMT chairman, made the remarks at an
electoral campaign rally in Taipei attended by mostly young
supporters.</P>
      <P>Lien noted that because of the economic recession in the last few
years, education spending has decreased to the current rate of 4.39
percent of the GNP.</P>
      <P>He pledged to increase education spending to 5 percent of the GNP
in the first year of his term if he wins the election, and raise it
to 6 percent in the second year.</P>
      <P>After the first two years, Lien added, he will keep the rate at a
level no less than 6 percent of the GNP.</P>
      <P>A 6 percent figure would represent a budget of NT$600 billion
(US$17.6 billion) , in comparison with the current level of NT$438
billion, according to Lien.</P>
      <P>With the increased budget on education, Lien said he will focus
on advanced education in order to elevate the island's
competitiveness amid the fierce competition from mainland China.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lien said his administration will offer full
scholarships to 500 students to pursue advanced studies abroad, and
low-interest loans worth NT$10 billion to young people interested in
studying abroad.</P>
      <P>Referring to the KMT's assets, which many say have been embezzled
from the country by the party during its five-decade rule, Lien
claimed that he issued instructions for a review of KMT assets
immediately after he assumed the party leadership, and ordered a
quick return of some land lots to the government.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, he claimed, the KMT has put all its assets into
trust and has promised that it will no longer manage party-owned
business enterprises.</P>
      <P>He added that the KMT will announce all its assets to the public
starting from next week for public scrutiny.</P>

Libya to give up arms programs, Bush announces

Libya's leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, has
admitted that his country had been trying to
develop a broad arsenal of unconventional
weapons, and he promised to dismantle them up
and submit to international inspections,
President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair of
Britain said Friday.

Libya's actions came after nine months of
secret diplomacy, beginning with an overture from
Colonel Qaddafi to London and Washington just
as the invasion of Iraq was beginning.

The Wall Street Journal: Libya to give Up
arms program, says inspections will be allowed

Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has agreed
under pressure to halt his nation's drive to
develop chemical and nuclear weapons and the

      <P>A man was arrested in Taipei Saturday on
charges of attempting to take bogus Taiwan currency to Vietnam for
laundering, police said.</P>
      <P>The man surnamed Lin told police that he intended to take fake
New Taiwan dollar bills to Vietnam for laundering because NT dollar
trading is brisk in the black market in that country.</P>
      <P>As cross-border money laundering will not only disrupt Taiwan's
and Vietnam's financial market order but will also undermine Taiwan's
international image, police said they will make further
investigation into the case and bring Lin's accomplices to justice.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan companies making huge investments in mainland China
and Southeast Asian countries, the amount of NT dollar circulating
in those countries has been increasing. And some criminal rings
allegedly have used bogus banknotes for money laundering for illegal
profits. POlice said they will step up probes to stave off
such illegal practices.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Saturday that he
will do his utmost to help small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
to upgrade their production and management in order to survive
ever-increasing competition in the global market.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks while attending a seminar on SME development
organized by the National Association of Small and Medium
Enterprises. More than 500 SME representatives attended the meeting.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has 1.1 million SMEs providing 7.36 million
jobs, Yu said SMEs have contributed greatly to Taiwan's economic
prosperity over the decades.</P>
      <P>"Even though we have large enterprises and high-tech companies to
serve as a locomotive in driving our economic development, we would
have been unable to create an economic miracle if we did not have so
many SMEs," Yu said.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Yu said, the government has consistently
given priority to helping SMEs resolve their difficulties and has
adopted various measures to boost their development.</P>
      <P>As the ruling Democratic Progressive Party fails to control a
majority in the Legislative Yuan, Yu said, the executive branch has
encountered many setbacks in carrying out economic and financial
reform projects over the past three years.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he said, the DPP administration has never been
daunted by obstacles to its reform agenda. Over the past three years,
he said, the government has completed a number of reform projects in
the economic and financial fields in order to create a better
business and investment environment for local businessmen.</P>
      <P>"Our efforts have to some extent paid off. Our economy has
bottomed out of a recession. And Taiwan's rankings in all major
economic indexes compiled by the world's 10 largest economic rating
agencies have all advanced to higher slots this year," Yu said.</P>
      <P>Despite pressure from opposition parties and some soical
quarters, Yu said, the DPP administration will never stop its reform
efforts. Yu also touted the administration's achievements in
improving water quality in the southern port city of Kaohsiung and
in building the Taichung Science-based Industrial Park in 10
months.</P>
      <P>In the early days of the DPP administration, Yu said, the Taiwan
economy suffered a downturn because of worldwide economic doldrums
and domestic structural transformation. Through concerted efforts of
the govenrment and the industrial sector, Yu said, the local economy
has returned to the normal track of steady growth.</P>
      <P>In the future, Yu assured SME executives that the govenrment will
continue crafting measures favorable for business development.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADA TO OFFER LATEST SARS MONITORING TECHNOLOGY TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Toronto,  Dec.  19 (CNA)
(By Paul Chang and Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Canadian Network for Vaccines and
Immunotherapeutics (CANVAC) , an organization subsidized by the
Canadian government, will offer Taiwan the latest monitoring
technology for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) , CANVAC
Director Michel Klein said Friday.</P>
      <P>The offer will form part of a bilateral cooperation project
between CANVAC and Taiwan's National Health Research Institute (NHRI)
aimed at developing vaccines against SARS, Klein noted.</P>
      <P>According to an agreement signed by CANVAC and the NHRI, the two
institutions will exchange and test blood samples of SARS patients in
different phases, a task that will help scientists on both sides
understand how the human immune system reacts when attacked by the
SARS virus.</P>
      <P>In the next few months, CANVAC and the NHRI will experiment with
vaccines on animals and will start human trials on a small group of
volunteers in 2005.</P>
      <P>Klein said Taiwan has found an element that will play an
important role in the development of a SARS vaccine.</P>
      <P>Noting that although there is little possibility of SARS
outbreaks at present, Klein said the threat still exists and he
stressed the importance of prevention work.</P>
      <P>In addition to the SARS monitoring technology, CANVAC will also
offer Taiwan the technology to produce vaccines against other
virus-borne diseases.</P>
      <P>CANVAC is the only Canadian network comprising public, private
and academic partners in the field of vaccine research and
development focusing on immune-based prophylaxis and therapy for
cancer, viral diseases and emerging viral infections such as HIV,
hepatitis C and SARS.</P>
      <P>With 79 top researchers in immunology, virology and molecular
biology, CANVAC cooperates closely with biopharmaceutical companies
around the globe.</P>

kicked off Saturday in Taitung, eastern Taiwan, focusing on the
weaving and knitting skills of Austronesian civilization.</P>
      <P>The festival, organized by the Taitung county government and the

      <P>In addition to the exhibition of weaving and knitting,
festival-goers will also be able to get a better understanding of the
movements of the Austronesian people and of their marine and

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT, DDP TURN UP HEAT ON KMT FOR ILL-GOTTEN ASSETS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 20 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian and his Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) continued to pan the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Saturday over its ill-gotten assets, one day after the KMT
agreed to hand back eight parcels of real estate to the government.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a rally of his supporters from the Chen clan in
southern Tainan County, the president cast doubts on KMT Chairman
Lien Chan's claims that his party is working hard to divest itself of
assets embezzled during nearly five decades of authoritarian rule.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed that the KMT sold off most of the property it stole
from the country, including the sale of NT$200 billion (US$5.87
billion)-worth of real estate and NT$170 billion (US$4.99
billion)-worth of stocks in 2000 alone when the party lost its grip
on power.</P>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun applied another turn to the screw Saturday by
pressing the KMT not only to hand back the remaining illegally
obtained property but also to repay the government for the ill-gotten
assets it has already sold, even if the move brings the KMT to
bankruptcy.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Duan Yi-kan also jumped on the KMT-bashing
bandwagon, calling a news conference in front of the KMT headquarters
to claim that the site of the eight-story building was purchased by
KMT from the government at just one-tenth of the market price in
1980.</P>
      <P>He demanded that the KMT stump up the other nine-tenths of the
price, which he put at NT$4 billion (US$11.74 million).</P>
      <P>Duan's news conference annoyed the KMT workers in the
headquarters, who ordered Duan to leave the premises. This led to a
quarrel that drew many amused onlookers and snarled traffic outside
the headquarters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA INAUGURATES BILINGUAL NGO WEBSITE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
formally inaugurated a bilingual non-government organization (NGO)
Website Saturday to signify the determination of the people of Taiwan
to take part in global affairs.</P>
      <P>Addressing a ceremony to mark the inauguration of the NGO Website
and the opening of an exhibition of Taiwan NGO activities and their
exchanges with major international NGOs at the Taipei World Trade
Center, Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene Chien said the Website is
the first government-financed platform for information exchanges
between Taiwan's NGOs and relevant international organizations.</P>
      <P>It is also the first government-organized virtual NGO center on
the Internet, Chien said, adding that he hopes it will help boost
Taiwan NGOs' interchanges with international NGOs and expand Taiwan's
external relations.</P>
      <P>Citing the story of the 15-year-old African "elephant man" Ahfoo,
who recently underwent surgery at a Taiwan hospital to have a
gigantic tumor on his face removed with the assistance of the MOFA
and several private organizations, Chien said he believes that the
establishment of the new NGO Website will help extend Taiwan's love
to the world and further boost the nation's diplomatic work.</P>
      <P>Ahfoo, a Von Recklinghausen's disease patient whose real name is
Vincent Kabore, came to Taiwan from the West African state of Burkina
Faso in early November under the auspices of the Noordhoff
Craniofacial Foundation, EVA Airways and the MOFA to undergo surgery
at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, which is famous for its plastic and
craniofacial surgery.</P>
      <P>Ahfoo's plight became known here after a Taiwan conscript working
with the ROC medical aid mission in Burkina Faso as an alternative to
compulsory military service posted a series of reports on the
Internet.</P>
      <P>"The Ahfoo case marks the best example of pooling the strength of
Taiwan's NGOs and information technology to extend its concern and
medical service to a needy person," Chien said.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the bilingual NGO Website is also a response
to a U.N. appeal to narrow the digital divide between rich and poor
countries, Chien said.</P>
      <P>The Website offers a detailed introduction to Taiwan's NGO
development, including information about upcoming conferences, NGO
personnel training programs and reports on Taiwan's participation in
international NGO activities.</P>
      <P>"The Website serves as a gateway for foreign people to get a
glimpse into Taiwan's NGO affairs, " Chien said, adding that the
Website also bridges exchanges between local NGOs and their
international counterparts.</P>
      <P>Ahfoo also attended the NGO Website opening ceremony. He
struggled to say "thanks" in Chinese to express his heartfelt
gratitude for the medical care he has received in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the company of his father, Ahfoo arrived in Taiwan Nov. 4 and
is scheduled to leave for home Dec. 24.</P>
      <P>After undergoing two 13-hour operations, Ahfoo can now speak and
make facial expressions. Prior to the surgery, most of his face and
neck were covered by a giant tumor. Dr. Chen Yu-jui, the convener of
the Chang Gung surgical team, said Ahfoo's condition continues to
improve and that his protective facial mask can be removed in six
months.</P>

      <P>Taiwan was looking forward to lifting
precautionary measures against severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) by the end of the month Saturday as 32 of the 34 people
ordered to stay at home over concerns that they might be suffering
from the disease were to come out of quarantine.</P>
      <P>The 34 persons were considered to be in the danger of having been
infected because they had close contact with a confirmed SARS
patient. Twenty of them had already ended their 10-day quarantine
time without any signs of SARS and 12 more were to end their
quarantine at midnight.</P>
      <P>The two others -- the patient's wife and father -- who took care
of the patient until he was taken to the hospital Dec. 15 have to
stay at home under self-quarantine until Dec. 25.</P>
      <P>Unless new cases come to light, the precautionary measure of
taking teperatures of visitors to public places will end Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>The island was put on a level B alert -- the second-highest of a
four-level system -- Dec. 17 after a military researcher exposed
himself to the SARS virus in a laboratory and fell ill.</P>
      <P>The results of an investigation released Thursday determined that
it is an isolated case, as the victim was infected in a
maximum-security laboratory with a biosafety level of four and the
chance of the virus getting out of the laboratory are virtually nil.</P>
      <P>Thirty-four people who had come into close contact with the
patient, including members of his family and passengers who sat near
him on airplanes to and from Singapore, were told to quarantine
themselves at home for ten days.</P>
      <P>The patient was reported to be recovering at the Taipei Municipal

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The authorities were urged Sunday to
accelerate the pace of legislation on anti-spam laws to reduce waste
in social costs, ward off infringement of privacy and alleviate the
other social problems attributed to unsolicited e-mail.</P>
      <P>Huang Ching-ning, a lawyer with the non-profit Institute for
Information Industry, said that Taiwan should emulate the United
States, the European Union and Australia in enacting regulations to
govern unsolicited e-mail, or spam to prevent the development of
Taiwan's e-industry from being adversely affected.</P>
      <P>An opinion poll conducted recently by the non-profit Secure
Online Shopping Association (SOSA) shows that some 40 percent of the
e-mail received daily by domestic Internet users is unwanted junk
mail, causing a tremendous waste of time and energy on the part of
consumers, as well as degradation of business efficiency.</P>
      <P>According to SOSA, unwanted e-mail cost businesses in the United
States US$9 billion in lost productivity in 2002, making it an issue
worthy of serious attention.</P>
      <P>SOSA officials noted that the governor of California signed into
law the toughest ever anti-spam measures in September, calling for a
ban on junk e-mail and slapping fines of up to US$1 million on
offenders.</P>
      <P>Last week, they said, U.S. President George W. Bush signed the
"CAN-SPAM Act" aimed at reining in the waves of unwanted e-mail. The
act was approved by the U.S. Congress in November.</P>
      <P>Liu Chiang-ping, director of the Institute of Intellectual
Property Studies of National Chengchi University, said that in
addition to the U.S. action, other governments, including those of the
United Kingdom and Singapore, have also in recent months enacted
legislation to control the tide of spam.</P>
      <P>Liu attributed the growing percentage of offensive Internet bulk
advertising and pornographic junk e-mail to the fact that sending
such mail is relatively cheaper than sending postal "snail" mail or
running television advertisements.</P>
      <P>The professor said, however, that despite the urgency of the
enactment of laws, some critics in Taiwan are opposed to its
enactment, saying that such a law would run counter to the spirit of
freedom of speech.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, in Taiwan, only SOSA provides businesses and
advertising firms with non-binding self-disciplinary measures aimed
at regulating the content of electronic messages.</P>
      <P>He said that so far there have only been "discussions" on the
enactment of related laws and that Taiwan "has a long way to go"
before it will see an anti-spam bill passed into law.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Police efforts to crack down on commercial
piracy have been successful this year, with the seizure of a record
high of 5,743 fake products of famous brand names as of the end of
November, a spokesman for the National Police Administration (NPA)
reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>As the lunar New Year holiday approaches, police authorities
islandwide have recently launched a new clampdown, the spokesman
said, adding that they nabbed nearly 400 bootlegged products with an
estimated value of about NT$1 billion (about US$29.4 million) just
over the past three days.</P>
      <P>The pirated goods seized by police range from bags, clothes,
watches, cellular phone cases and cosmetics, which were all
imitations of big-name brands such as Gucci, LV, Nike, Rolex,
Montblanc, Nokia and Motorola, as well as many newly published
popular music CDs and video games, as well as computer software
programs, VCDs and DVDs, the spokesman noted.</P>
      <P>Police officers around the island focused their anti-piracy
search on traditional markets, night markets, business centers and
shopping malls, suspected warehouses and factories and over the
Internet, while the immigration authorities and customs officials
have stepped up their scrutiny at seaports and airports nationwide.</P>
      <P>The results obtained by the police strongly underscore the
government's resolve to stamp out violations of intellectual property
rights in rapport with Taiwan's commitment and the promises it made
to gain entry to the World Trade Organization, he said, noting that
the NPA also offers handsome incentives to encourage police officers
to carry out their mission.</P>

Shui-bian's campaign for re-election, formally starting the mechanism
for officials campaigning for the presidency.</P>
      <P>As the premier had earlier asked government officials to abide by

activities, the officials did not use their official vehicles to go

the minister of National Defense, the chairman of the Central

meeting, also as part of the "administrative neutrality" principle.</P>
      <P>The premier said before the meeting that in democratic politics,
it is only natural for appointed officials to take part in campaign
activities, but he criticized the opposition Kuomintang for
conducting party affairs in government offices when it was in power,
and for allowing government officials to concurrently serve as party
officials during its rule, "blurring the ethical line between the

    <HEADLINE>YEAR-END BONUSES SLIGHTLY BETTER THIS YEAR: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 21 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan white-collar workers are expected to
receive an average year-end bonus worth 1.46 months of salary for
their performance over the past year, according to the results of a
survey released Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to the results of the poll, carried out by the
executive research Website 9999.com.tw, domestic businesses will
reward their workers with year-end bonuses worth 1.46 months of
salary in appreciation for their efforts over the past year.</P>
      <P>The average is slightly up compared to the year-earlier bonus of
1.33 months, reflecting that domestic businesses performed better
this year, but it falls slightly short of the workers' general
expectation of 1.55 months, the survey shows.</P>
      <P>According to the results, employees in financial sector will get
the most handsome bonuses worth 2.56 months of their salaries for
2003, followed by workers in the foreign trade sector and by those in
service brokerage sector. The ranking for the hi-tech sector fell to
ninth from fourth for last year, it discovers.</P>
      <P>Workers in the restaurant and entertainment sector, as well as
those in the publishing business and tourist agencies are the least
fortunate, mainly because of the outbreaks of severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the first half of this year.</P>
      <P>Local tourist agency workers, at the bottom, could receive an
average bonus of just 1.07 months for 2003, a fall from the 2002
level of 1.17 months, according to the poll. Many tourist agencies
failed to ride out the SARS impact and have folded.</P>
      <P>Despite the negative impact of SARS, some 46 percent of domestic
companies said their operations have been more profitable this year,
ahead of about 27 percent that said they were stable and 25 percent
which acknowledged a decline in business.</P>
      <P>Around 33 percent said they have met their annual profit target,
while about 23 percent said they have outperformed their set
objective for the year. At the same time, some 38 percent said they
are set to register a lower-than-expected profit, with around 21
percent claiming that they are effectively running in the red,
according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Out of a total of 85 percent of the business owners surveyed,
including those who expect a drop in profit, 55 percent said they
will give year-end bonuses this year because it is a "routine
practice."</P>
      <P>Some 44 percent said they will do so because they made "good
profit" and 32 percent cited "workers' good performance" as the major
reasons for the bonuses. About 22 percent said their year-end bonus
is aimed at encouraging workers to stay, according to the poll.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted Dec. 2-15 among 60,000 companies in 21
business categories and received valid responses from 3,150 business
owners, with a margin of error of 2.35 percent.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Sunday that
promotion of the rights of the disabled is one of the government's
goals.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the government is striving to establish a "fair
and just" welfare state and that it will adopt a "pragmatic and
creative" approach to promote the welfare and services for the
disabled.</P>
      <P>He noted that as of the end of September, around 810,000 people
in Taiwan are registered as disabled, or around 3.73 percent of the
population. This, he said, highlights the fact that their basic needs
should be addressed and their rights better protected.</P>
      <P>He noted that the government has appropriated a budget of
NT$24.99 billion (US$73.5 million) this year to take care of the
welfare of the disabled.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said that in order to better provide for the
disabled in low and middle-income families, the monthly subsidies for
them will be raised by NT$1,000 to between NT$3,000 and NT$7,000
starting Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>Chen said that to promote "equal opportunities, full
participation and independent living in happiness and dignity" for
the disabled is the government's goal, but he also pointed out that
the government's resources are limited and he appealed for the
assistance of the private sector to provide better care for the
disabled.</P>

Taichung City, central Taiwan, Lu said that the DPP beat the

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT URGES CONTINUED INSISTENCE ON REFORMS, DEMOCRACY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed his
belief Sunday in democracy and reforms when he spoke to the graduates
of a school he founded earlier this year.</P>
      <P>The president said that compared to the 23 million people of
Taiwan, the 600 alumni of the inaugural class of the Ketagalan
Academy is not a large number, but he said that as long as they
realize and carry out their historic missions, they will
"successfully galvanize the dynamism of the Taiwan people."</P>
      <P>The president said history clearly indicates that insistence on
democracy and reforms is the right direction and he urged the
graduates to "believe in themselves and in Taiwan" to help create a
splendid chapter in Taiwan's history.</P>
      <P>Chen said that although he faces re-election soon, he is most
concerned now "not about the results of the election, but about how
to continue the ideals of reforms."</P>
      <P>He said he would not confront the anti-reform forces, but would
rather adopt the approach of dialogue with them because he believes
that the flow of democracy cannot be deterred by individuals.</P>
      <P>He also said that it requires time to strengthen democracy, which
is why he chose to use the most time-consuming, yet most solid way to
help democratic reforms -- the founding of the Ketagalan Academy, a
school established March 29, 2003 to nurture the nation's future
leaders.</P>
      <P>Chen said that looking at the history of Taiwan after World War
II, one can see that the country has achieved tremendous success with
its economy, but he said the opening up of society has been
comparably very slow.</P>
      <P>He said he believes Taiwan people are born with tenacity and
dynamism. They weathered the Kuomintang's white terror following the
tragic Feb. 28 incident, and the suppression of martial law, but in
the late 1980s, they were able to break free from the shackles of
authoritarian rule.</P>
      <P>From the lifting of martial law, the comprehensive election of
the Legislative Yuan, the popular presidential election of 1996 to
the political power transfer of 2000, the dynamism of the Taiwan
people was finally able to be released.</P>
      <P>Chen said that over the past decade, he has seen the release of
this dynamism, but he has also seen the impact of different social
forces.</P>
      <P>"Even more than three years after political power transfer,
Taiwan society today is still trying to build up a new order, " Chen
said, adding that "the value and ideals pursued in the past need to
be clarified and implemented."</P>
      <P>He said that he had hoped that the political power transfer would
bring a new start for Taiwan so that the dynamism of the Taiwan
people could be pooled and reforms pushed forward.</P>
      <P>But he lamented that even though "the Taiwan people have chosen
political power transfer and democratic reforms, some political
figures, clinging to their past glory and resisting reforms, have
tried to drag their feet on the pace of national progress through
political bickering without considering the well-being of the
nation."</P>
      <P>Chen said that the strength of a single individual is small, but
pooling the strength of individuals with ideals and the will to
implement their ideals can change history.</P>
      <P>He said that graduation is the start of responsibility, and he
exhorted the alumni to sow the seeds of democracy.</P>
      <P>The 600 alumni said they would throw their weight behind Chen's
re-election campaign.</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-mai, president of the alumni of the Ketagalan Academy,
said one should carefully choose the right national leader -- one who
can uphold the nation's core values.</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-mai said that only if President Chen wins the March
presidential election will he be able to "deepen the nation's
democracy, insist on reforms and bring a better future to the
nation."</P>

    <HEADLINE>HI-TECH TYCOON REMEMBERS OLD PAL WHO SHARES HUMANISTIC IDEALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Barry Lam, chairman of Quanta Computer,
remembered with sobs recently his National Taiwan University
classmate Sayling Wen, one of Taiwan's first calculator-makers, who
went on to become a pioneer of the island's information technology
industry and died of cerebral hemorrhage earlier this month.</P>
      <P>Lam, who is camera-shy despite being a successful high-technology
tycoon, has been reluctantly in the spotlight recently because of the
passing of Wen, who had been Lam's old pal and business partner for
decades.</P>
      <P>Extremely alike, both Lam and Wen are known as hi-tech giants as
well as great men who champion and herald humanistic ideals and put
their ideals into practice.</P>
      <P>According to Lam, he invested NT$5 billion (US$147 million) to
establish the Quanta Research Center, which is not just a research
center for "hard and cold" science and technology, but an institution
full of humanistic interest, including a concert hall, an art gallery
and a library.</P>
      <P>Lam and Wen were bunkmates during their university and
postgraduate NTU years and as business partners at Kinpo Electronics,
which was one of the country's first calculator manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Wen, 55, who became president of calculator manufacturer Santron
at the age of 24, went into a coma Dec. 5 due to a hemorrhagic stroke
and was rushed to hospital. He never awoke from the coma.</P>
      <P>His sudden passing caught unprepared his old friends from Santron
and the thousands of staff members of Inventec Group, one of the
major notebook and IT device manufacturers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wen, Lam and Chiang Ying-tsun, former chairman of GVC
Electronics, co-founded Santron Electronics in 1972 to manufacture
electronic devices and Taiwan's first-generation electronic
calculators.</P>
      <P>In 1973, at the age of 25, Wen, Lam and some other IT enthusiasts
jointly established Kinpo Electronics to expand their manufacture of
calculators as well as to research and develop simple computers.</P>
      <P>In 1975, Wen and classmate Yeh Kuo-yi co-founded Inventec Group
to make computer peripherals and related products. The founding of
these companies paved the way for Taiwan's transition into a global
hardware manufacturing powerhouse.</P>
      <P>By the age of 26, Wen had traveled to 43 countries, most of the
time traveling with a suitcase containing calculators and other
innovative electronic devices. By the age of 40, he had traveled to
70 countries around the world, spending about 300 days out of every
year in hotels or aboard airplanes.</P>
      <P>At 50, Wen retired from the electronics business, as he had
planned, and became a writer and a philanthropist.</P>
      <P>In 2000, he found himself in the rural township of Huangyangchuan
in Gansu Province, one of the poorest areas of mainland China. He
said at the time that seeing the local residents there living in
grinding poverty brought him to the verge of tears.</P>
      <P>He spent the entire year of 2002 traveling around 12 provinces in
western, southern and northern China, trying to figure out the best
ways to help impoverished mainland people.</P>
      <P>That same year, he set up the Qian-Xiang-Wan-Cai Co. in
Huangyangchuan to establish a computerized network at a cost of US$50
million in western mainland China as a fast track on which the
locals' livelihood could be improved.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he invested US$5 million to build a five-star,
150-room hotel-like conference center in Huangyangchuan, claiming
that the hotel would serve as a home away from home for businessmen.
"Only by attracting the wealthy to poor areas will the poor be freed
from poverty," he said at the time.</P>
      <P>Wen was also planning to establish a software development company
in Huangyangchuan to turn the backwater into a high-tech hub in
western China.</P>
      <P>By early 2003, Wen was the talk of the town in western China.</P>
      <P>A philanthropist, Wen himself led the simplest life that he
possibly could. Being a little bit plump, Wen stopped eating anything
after 3 p.m. every day and only drank diet cola after that hour.</P>
      <P>Despite the wealth he accumulated over the past three decades,
Wen once said that the richness of life derived from his experiences
over the years was his only real fortune.</P>
      <P>Wen had his first book published at the age of 49 when he and his
friends, including renowned cartoonist Tsai Chih-chung, co-founded
the Studio for Tomorrow. In the following six years, he authored 20
books on business management and philosophy, English learning, the
development potential of western China, and on various other
subjects.</P>
      <P>In fact, according to Tsai, Wen's greatest ambition was to become
a novelist writing exclusively Chinese kung fu novels. Wen began to
write kung fu novels as a ghost writer in high school to earn money
to help his mother make ends meet, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Tsai used the Chinese word "kuan, " which can mean either "wide"
or "magnanimous, " to describe Wen. He said Wen had a wide body and
was a "wide-minded" man who always demonstrated magnanimity toward
his family and friends.</P>
      <P>Wen was impartial politically, giving support to any party that
he considered was doing a good thing for the people and the country.
He once gave the Democratic Progressive Party NT$500,000 in cash to
help out the then-opposition party during its most difficult years.</P>
      <P>More recently, he was scheduled to attend a ceremony marking the
establishment of the national presidential campaign headquarters of
the "pan-blue alliance" ticket of Lien Chan and James Soong slated
for Dec. 7 to drum up support for the major opposition camp. He never
made it.</P>
      <P>He left numerous "quotable quotes" in his online chats, such as:
"The computer is my office, " "Working is a duty as well as a joy, "
and "Flying is a time for writing and sleeping."</P>
      <P>He also wrote during one of his online chats that: "Busy is
staying for only one day at one hotel and not having time to have
your clothes washed. Leisure is staying at the same hotel for three
days or more."</P>
      <P>More than 10,000 people went to a memorial service held in
Huangyangchuan Saturday to pay their last respects to Wen, who,
according to the Hong Kong-based Wenweipao daily, came from "all the
cities and villages in the western Chinese province of Gansu."</P>
      <P>Chen Yun-lin, chief of mainland China's State Council Taiwan
Affairs Office, went to a memorial service in Beijing Dec. 17 to pay
his respects to Wen for his invaluable contributions in the efforts
to speed up intellectual development in western China. The service
was sponsored by the Inventec Group's affiliate in Beijing.
He also sent his condolences to Wen's family.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ZEN MASTER GIVES BUDDHIST LECTURES IN VANCOUVER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Vancouver,  Dec. 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Zen Buddhist Master Sheng Yen of Taiwan
delivered a lecture on Buddha's teachings in Vancouver Saturday,
titled "A Peaceful Mind is the Source of all Peace."</P>
      <P>In his first speech in Canada in eight years, Sheng Yen said that
peace is fortune, that peace derives from the heart and that if one
seeks peace, one must first examine the thoughts circulating in one's
mind.</P>
      <P>Talking about a recent journey he made to the Middle East, Sheng
Yen said that he was advised by many people prior to the journey
against going there, on the grounds that it would be unsafe to travel
in an area rife with military conflicts.</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen said he had no fear because his mind was at peace.
He said it is his honor to share Buddha's teachings with people and
policy makers in the Middle East at a time when peace is keenly
needed worldwide.</P>
      <P>More than 2,300 people, Chinese as well as foreigners, attended
Sheng Yen's Vancouver speech.</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen traveled to Israel and Palestine Dec. 9-15 in an effort
to help put an end to conflict in the area by means of spiritual
enlightenment.</P>
      <P>Traveling with some 20 world religious leaders, Sheng Yen, a
member of the 2003 World Council of Religious and Spiritual Leaders,
was hoping to use the power of religion to bridge the differences
between the two sides, who have been at odds for many years,
according to officials of the Dharma Drum Mountain Buddhist
Association (DDMBA) in Taipei.</P>
      <P>During the week-long "spiritual journey" in the Middle East,
Sheng Yen presented two words -- mercy and wisdom -- to the Israeli
and Palistinian people and political leaders as the keys to the
pursuit of peace, the DDMBA officials said.</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen called for the leaderships of both Israel and Palestine
to use wisdom to work out solutions to their differences while
practicing mercy on all the people in the region regardless of their
political affiliation or religion, so as to not let down the people
living in the Holy Land.</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen and his party met with Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed
Qureia during a symposium held in Jerusalem Dec. 11. After hearing
Sheng Yen's preaching, Qureia reportedly applauded enthusiastically
and said to his aides that he looks forward to seeing Sheng Yen's
suggestions put into practice.</P>
      <P>At a colloquium held at the Israeli prime minister's office Dec.
14, Sheng Yen delivered a speech to ranking Israeli officials,
including Cabinet officials, parliamentary advisers and government
consultants in news and religious affairs, according to the DDMBA
officials.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Sheng Yen interpreted Islamic doctrine as
stipulating that Jihad -- or holy war -- does not mean to strive to
defeat others, but instead to defeat one's own evil thoughts. "This
is an idea almost the same as the Buddhist concept of conquering the
evil in one's mind," Sheng Yen noted.</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen said he hopes that all the followers of Islam, Judaism
and Christianity will reach out their hands to one another so that
world peace will prevail.</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen, author of many books on Buddhism both in Chinese and
in English, is respected in Taiwan, mainland China and around the
world. As a Zen master, his teachings emphasize that practitioners
should in their daily lives be constantly aware of the thoughts
circulating in their minds.</P>
      <P>Such awareness allows people to simplify their minds and to
clearly perceive changes in themselves and in their environment, he
explained. Wisdom is developed so that people can apply it in their
workaday lives to face themselves, grow and dissolve their
attachments and enter into a state of "no-self."</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen has been actively engaged in inter-faith exchanges that
advocate and promote religious understanding. His involvement in such
global activities includes being a member of the 2003 World Council
of Religious and Spiritual Leaders and delivering the keynote address
at the 2000 Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual
Leaders in New York.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, he founded the DDMBA, which now has over one million
followers. In the United States, he has been teaching the
Buddhadharma since 1975, leading to the founding of two centers, one
in New York City and one in Upstate New York.</P>
      <P>After concluding his week-long journey in the Middle East, Sheng
Yen flew to New York Dec. 15 to continue his preaching in North
America, which also took him to Vancouver, Canada.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REAL ESTATE MARKET PREDICTED TO BE BULLISH IN 2004</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  21 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's real estate market will remain
bullish for the coming year as the end of a booming 2003 approaches,
business sources forecast Sunday.</P>
      <P>Thanks to an economic recovery taking place both at home and
abroad, business sources said the domestic real estate sector will
continue its boom into 2004, despite some uncertainties related to
the March presidential election and bank interest rates.</P>
      <P>They said they are confident that the ailing market over the past
decade will fully regain its momentum in the coming year, evidenced
in that consumer confidence and business conditions have been greatly
improved.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the Ministry of the Interior,
house transfer dealings for the whole of 2003 are expected to total
around 334,000, slightly up by 4.4 percent over the 2002 level.</P>
      <P>The growth shows that buying has made a noticeable comeback,
despite the marked impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
on business in the first half of the year, the sources noted.</P>
      <P>Chang Hsin-min, an assistant manager of the Sinyi Realty Estate
Inc., attributed the good performance to a "three lows" situation --
low house prices, low bank interest rates and a 50-percent cut in
land value increment tax, in addition to the preferential loans worth
NT$280 million (US$8.24 billion) gradually released by banks since
August in line with government policy.</P>
      <P>Although some uncertainties remain at home and in the
international arena, Chang said an improved economy has anticipated a
booming market in 2004, particularly in the aftermath of the March
presidential election, even if the preferential loans are used up or
the 50-percent discount in land value increment tax is canceled.</P>
      <P>The domestic real estate market has managed to gain a new lease
on life amid a recession in recent years and a bullish market is
expect to set off in 2004, as long as war does not erupt across the
Taiwan Strait following the presidential race and as long as the
stock market continues to grow, he predicted.</P>
      <P>An investigation by Sinyi Realty Estate Inc. shows that the
domestic real estate market has the potential to expand by between 5
percent and 10 percent over the next year in terms of transaction
numbers and house prices, respectively.</P>
      <P>Newly built houses near major traffic networks or prime public
space will be good targets for sales, according to the investigation
results.</P>

Monday.</P>
      <P>According to COA tallies, at least 17 kinds of Taiwan-grown

      <P>Major Taiwan fruit and vegetable export items include pineapples,
papayas, lichees, star fruit, oranges, bananas, mangos, bell fruit,

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT) should stay in
opposition until it gives back its ill-gotten assets to the people,
President Chen Shui-bian said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chatting with journalists at a tea party, the president said the
KMT is hardly qualified to be in power again unless it hands back the
assets it accumulated illegally in its five decades of rule.</P>
      <P>The president, who is engaged in a pitched battle against KMT
Chairman Lien Chan in the race for the presidency in 2004, believes
the embezzled KMT assets is the opposition's Achilles heel in the
campaign and he and his ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
have been focusing their fire on the issue.</P>
      <P>Chen said the KMT's ill-gotten assets are a relic of the
country's past authoritarian regime and claimed that the party has
done nothing to address the issue in the three years since it lost
the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The party has never given a full account of his assets, far less
giving any back to the people, according to Chen. The DPP has tried
more than 30 times in the last three years to press for a law to
force the KMT to face up to the problem but has been blocked because
of the opposition's legislative majority.</P>
      <P>In order to push the party to relinquish its stolen assets, the
president said, the KMT should be denied the power to rule in the
forthcoming presidential election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MIB DENIES TAIWAN SPIES ARRESTED IN MAINLAND CHINA: LAWMAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 22 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Both the Ministry of National Defense (MND)
and the Military Intelligence Bureau (MIB) have denied that any of
their spies have been arrested in the mainland since President Chen
Shui-bian announced that Beijing has 496 missiles aimed at Taiwan,
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Lee Wen-chung said
Monday.</P>
      <P>As a member of the National Defense Committee at the Legislative
Yuan, Lee said he checked with the MND and the MIB about reports that
36 people spying for Taiwan on the mainland were arrested as a result
of President Chen's Nov. 30 remarks, and was told that none of their
agents has been arrested since Nov. 30.</P>
      <P>Displaying satellite photos downloaded from a U.S. Website, Lee
told a news conference that the pictures clearly show every one of
Beijing's missile launch trucks. Since each truck is equipped with
six missiles, it is easy to figure out the total number of missiles
targeting Taiwan, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>According to the pictures posted on the Website, Lee said,
Beijing has deployed 96 missiles in Lepin, Jiangxi Province, 96
missiles in Ganxian, also in Jiangxi Province, 96 missiles in
Meizhou, Guangdong Province, 144 missiles in Yongan, Fujian Province,
all of which are within range of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee said the information about Beijing's missile deployment
depends more on satellite photos than intelligence gathered by spies.
The Hong Kong newspaper that claimed Chen has exposed the sources of

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER URGES KMT CHAIRMAN TO DEAL WITH PARTY ASSETS HONESTLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun urged the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Monday to handle its party assets in an "honest,
credible and sincere" manner and said that KMT Chairman Lien Chan
should "face history honestly."</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks as the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party continued to prioritize the assets of the KMT -- once one of
the richest parties in the world -- as one of its campaign themes in
the run-up to the March presidential election.</P>
      <P>The premier said that the KMT should publish a list of its
ill-gotten assets and return them to the national coffers.</P>
      <P>On the KMT's stance that former President and KMT Chairman Lee
Teng-hui should be held responsible for handling party assets, Yu
said that this is an internal party matter and that it should not use
such a pretext to drag its feet on the issue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Finance Minister Lin Chuan said he will check on the
status of the KMT's land lots, including the site of the KMT
headquarters as well as the Broadcasting Cooperation of China in
downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>As for property already relinquished by the KMT, such as seven
theaters that the party renounced ownership of last week, Lin said
the National Property Bureau has established contact with the KMT and
both sides agreed that the transfer will be completed in a simple
manner.</P>
      <P>KMT officials said Monday that since Lien took over the helm of
the party in April 2000, he has dealt with the party assets issue
"openly and transparently."</P>
      <P>The officials also claimed that April 2000 should be the cut-off
point and that the party would be willing to cooperate with
investigators to probe any assets obtained in dubious circumstances
before that time.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Solidarity Union, an ally of the DPP that claims
former President Lee as its "spiritual leader, " decided Monday that
it would form an action alliance to reclaim the KMT's assets.</P>
      <P>TSU officials said that they will invite private academic and
other groups to join the action alliance to push the KMT into giving
back the assets that belong rightfully to the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>They also welcomed those that have been used by the KMT as
figurehead owners of party assets to make such assets appear to be
privately owned to come forward with evidence against the KMT.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXPORTS, IMPORTS TO REGISTER DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH IN 2004: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's exports and imports will register
double-digit growth in 2004, according to a report carried out by the
Chung-Hwa Institution for Economic Research and released Monday by
the Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT).</P>
      <P>The report said that this will be possible because of the end of
the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks earlier this year and
the end of the U.S.-led war in Iraq, as well as the economic recovery
in the United States.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's major competitors will still be Singapore, South Korea
and Hong Kong, the report said.</P>
      <P>The report estimated that exports in 2003 could reach US$142.666
billion, up 9.24 percent, while imports will reach US$123.619
billion, up 9.85 percent.</P>
      <P>Riding on the coattails of the strong performance in the third
and fourth quarters in 2003, exports in 2004 should reach US$158.2
billion, up 10.89 percent, while imports will reach US$138.322
billion, up 11.89 percent, the report said.</P>
      <P>It also said that the factors favorable to Taiwan's exports in
2004 will include the strong economic rebound in the United States,
while the leading indicators in other advanced countries such as
Japan, Britain, France and Germany have also consistently signalled
economic recovery.</P>
      <P>Unfavorable factors will include the possible raising of interest
rates in early 2004 by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, coupled with
the continued sluggishness of the U.S. dollar against the yen and the
euro, which will burden the economic recovery in Japan and the
European Union and in turn affect the world economy.</P>
      <P>The BOFT compared Taiwan's trade performance with nine economies
in South Asia -- South Korea, Japan, mainland China, Singapore,
Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and Hong Kong. Taiwan
ranked fifth among the 10 economies, showing that there is room for
improvement, as its gross domestic product and per capita product
ranked fourth among the 10.</P>
      <P>BOFT officials said that Taiwan should make good use of its
geographic location to develop the country into a mid-point of the
world supply chain.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NAVY DENIES ALLEGATION ABOUT LAFAYETTE KICKBACK SETTLEMENT TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Navy General Headquarters (NGH) denied
any knowledge Monday about negotiations between Taiwan and France
over an out-of-court settlement for a kickback scandal involving
Taiwan's procurement of six Lafayette-class frigates.</P>
      <P>NGH Chief of Staff Huang Cheng-yun issued the denial at a meeting
of the Legislative Yuan's Judicial Committee.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Legislator Ku Chung-lien of the opposition
People First Party, who once served as navy commander-in-chief,
claimed that Thales Co. of France sent representatives to Taiwan Dec.
10 to discuss with "high-ranking ROC authorities" whether the
Lafayette kickback scandal could be settled out of court.</P>
      <P>According to Ku, Thales will send executives to Taiwan again in
January to further discuss the issue. Ku demanded that the relevant
military and judicial authorities explain their stances on the issue.</P>
      <P>In response, Huang said the NGH has no knowledge of the alleged
out-of-court settlement negotiations.</P>
      <P>Huang said the NGH had already filed an application with a French
arbitrary court in August 2001 to demand that Thales repay US$500
million in illegal kickbacks for the Lafayette deal and to compensate
the navy to the tune of US$90 million for damage to its reputation.</P>
      <P>According to the navy's warship procurement contract, the French
contractor was banned from paying any commission or kickbacks for the
deal.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Huang said, Thales filed a countersuit against
Taiwan for alleged violations of the procurement contract and
demanded that the navy pay US$200 million in damages.</P>
      <P>Huang said the suits might take many years to settle through
legal procedures. "We at the NGH have never heard of information
about the claimed negotiations for an out-of-court settlement, " he
added.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Vice Minister of Justice Hsieh
Wen-ting and State Public Prosecutor-General Lu Ren-fa said the
judicial authorities are not in a position to get involved in a civil
suit between the navy and Thales.</P>
      <P>"Judicial authorities are only responsible for investigating
whether any ROC national has illegally taken kickbacks in the
Lafayette deal," Lu said.</P>
      <P>The ROC Navy purchased six Lafayette frigates built by French
defense contractor Thomson-CSF for US$2.8 billion in 1991.
Thomson-CSF was taken over by Thales in 2000.</P>
      <P>Allegations of kickbacks over the deal emerged after the death of
Navy Captain Yin Ching-feng, head of the navy's arms acquisition
office, whose body was found floating in the sea off the east coast
of Taiwan in late 1993.</P>
      <P>Since Aug. 1, 2000, a special investigative team headed by Lu has
been probing arms procurement scandals allegedly connected with the
death of Yin.</P>
      <P>It has been alleged that Yin was murdered to prevent him from
blowing the whistle on rampant corruption in the military --
including the Lafayette deal.</P>
      <P>The investigation team has so far indicted six middle-ranking
naval officers on charges of inflating the Lafayette price tag for
the benefit of the French contractor. Three other naval officers have
also been indicted for irregularities in the procurement of an order
of minesweepers.</P>
      <P>As for the murder case, no major breakthrough has been achieved
because key suspect Andrew Wang, an arms broker who is believed to be
deeply involved in the Lafayette kickback scandal, remains at large,
reportedly residing in London.</P>
      <P>The investigation team has not yet discovered any hard evidence
of alleged Lafayette kickbacks paid to Taiwan officials.</P>
      <P>To speed up the investigations, the team has recently recruited
several prosecutors versed in financial and banking affairs to assist
in tracking the money trail.</P>
      <P>The Swiss Ministry of Justice announced earlier this month that a
federal court has ruled that Taiwan, France and the Principality of
Liechtenstein should be given access to Swiss legal files,
particularly documents regarding the Andrew Wang family's bank
accounts in Switzerland, to facilitate investigations into an alleged
kickback scandal in connection with Taiwan's procurement of six
Lafayette frigates.</P>
      <P>Swiss judicial authorities have frozen Wang's Swiss bank
accounts, which contain some US$600 million in slush funds suspected
of being kickbacks from the Lafayette frigate deal.</P>
      <P>Wang fled Taiwan in 1993 and has been wanted since September 2000
for suspected involvement in the alleged Lafayette kickback scandal
and the subsequent murder of Yin.</P>
      <P>Wang and his son, Wang Chia-hsing, might also have bank accounts
with deposits totaling US$100 million in Liechtenstein and the
British-administered Cayman Islands in the Caribbean Sea, according
to previous press reports.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Government authorities dismissed as an
"ill-motivated rumor" a Hong Kong press report Monday that mainland
China had uncovered a huge Taiwan spy ring following the revelation
by President Chen Shui-bian of the exact number of mainland Chinese
ballistic missiles aimed at locations in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman James Huang said the report was
unfounded and a politically motivated attempt to deal a blow to Chen.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong-based Ming Pao daily reported Monday that mainland
intelligence authorities had arrested 36 people, including 21
Taiwanese and 15 mainlanders, in mid-December, describing them as one
of the biggest Taiwan spy rings Beijing has cracked in recent years.</P>
      <P>According to the paper, mainland security authorities were able
to track down the spy ring after Chen detailed the Chinese arsenal
aimed at the island in a Nov. 30 campaign rally.</P>
      <P>"The report is intended to deal a blow to President Chen, " Huang
said, adding that some Hong Kong news media often cite unnamed
sources to back up their reports for political purposes.</P>
      <P>Huang pointed out that Chen had on many occasions mentioned the
number and locations of mainland China's missiles pointed at Taiwan
long before Nov. 30.</P>
      <P>With advanced satellite technology, Huang went on, the mainland's

      <P>The National Police Administration (NPA)
said Monday that it has stepped up protection of Americans in Taiwan
after the United States raised its national threat level to orange
the previous day.</P>

attacks, they had stepped up protection of American interests such as
the offices of the American Institute in Taiwan in central, southern

airports.</P>
      <P>They said that they had earlier mapped out contingency plans to
cope with any possible situation and that police officers at various

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION LAWMAKER MOTIONS TO HOLD REFERENDUM ON NUCLEAR PLANT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 22 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Chiu yi of the opposition People
First Party (PFP) said Monday that he was collecting signatures from
his colleagues for a motion to hold a referendum on whether to
continue work on the country's fourth nuclear plant.</P>
      <P>In a news conference at the Legislative Yuan, Chiu said the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has persistently tried to
disturb the political water by calling for a referendum on the
nuclear plant. In order to forestall them playing the issue against
the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and PFP, Chiu said he will seek the
sponsorship of other legislators to call for a referendum on the
issue and resolve the dispute once and for all.</P>
      <P>Citing the newly enacted referendum bill, Chiu said, an issue put
to referendum once should be forbidden from being put to referendum
again within eight years, which means the DPP would no longer be able
to use the plant as an excuse to stir up political disturbances for
at least that period of time.</P>
      <P>Chiu said he hopes the referendum will be held concurrently with
the presidential election of March 20.</P>
      <P>Chiu's idea was welcomed by the KMT but frowned upon by his own
party. KMT whip at the legislature Lee Chia-chin said the referendum
would pre-empt the DPP from using the nuclear plant to pester the
government formed after the election.</P>
      <P>Noting that KMT Chairman Lien Chan has said his party will
neither initiate nor block any referendum on the nuclear plant, Lee
said KMT lawmakers will support a motion for referendum on the issue.</P>
      <P>However, DPP convener at the legislature Chou Shih-wei said the
KMT and the PFP favor the continuation of work on the fourth
nuclear plant and will not propose any referendum to the contrary if
its purpose is just to pre-empt the DPP from playing up the issue
later.</P>
      <P>Chou said he will dissuade any PFP lawmaker from calling for a
referendum on this issue and will discourage them from sponsoring
such a proposal made by the DPP or its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity
Union.</P>
      <P>Chou's attitude seemed to reflect the mainstream opinion in the
two opposition parties, as a worker for the presidential campaign of
Lien Chan, who will pair up with PFP Chairman James Soong on the same
ticket, said the two party leaders have agreed to stick to Lien's
"neither start nor block" stance on the nuclear plant.</P>
      <P>Wang Jin-pyng, president of the Legislative Yuan and chief of
Lien's campaign, was quoted by an anonymous campaign worker as saying
that the KMT-PFP "pan blue alliance, " which succeeded in blocking a
DPP attempt to halt the building of the nuclear plant in the early
days of President Chen Shui-bian's presidency, need not upstage the
DPP by calling for a referendum on the issue.</P>
      <P>The two opposition parties will only confuse its supporters if it
reopens the debate on an already settled issue, and it is Chen, who
ran in 2000 on an anti-nuclear platform, who owes his supporters an
explanation as to why he was unable to keep his promise to get rid of
the nuclear plant, Wang reportedly said.</P>
      <P>Considering that a national referendum will cost the country a
fortune, the worker said, the two party leaders are of the opinion
that referendum should be used carefully to settle controversies
rather than be used as a campaign strategy to boost the profile of
the "pan blue alliance."</P>
      <P>The construction of the fourth nuclear plant was started by the
previous KMT government in 1998 with a price tag of NT$112.5 billion
(US$3.3 billion) amid protests from anti-nuclear activists.
Chen tried to stop construction after he swept to power in 2000, only
to trigger a fierce political struggle with the opposition in the
legislature. The opposition, mainly the KMT and PFP, united to force
Chen's administration to eat its words and resume construction of
the plant in 2001.</P>
      <P>Chen, who accepted the defeat with reluctance, vowed in June this
year to reopen the issue and put it to referendum before the 2004
presidential election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO EXPAND FIXED INVESTMENT: VICE PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Lin Hsin-i said Monday that
expansion of the government's fixed investment is urgent, as there is
already potential pressure for deflation.</P>
      <P>Lin, who concurrently serves as the chairman of the Council for
Economic Planning and Development, made the remarks at the
Legislative Yuan where several legislative committees were reviewing
the draft regulations regarding the expansion of public construction
projects, which will provide a legal basis for the new 10 major
public construction projects recently unveiled by the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that government investment in recent years has
continued to fall, which he said has not only seriously affected the
growth potential of the economy, but has become a major factor in
blocking economic growth.</P>
      <P>He said that fixed investment accounted for 7.3 percent of the
gross domestic product (GDP) in 1994, compared with only 4.1 percent
of the GDP in 2002, adding that fixed investment has shown negative
growth since 2000.</P>
      <P>He also said that this year, Taiwan's economy has been slowed by
the U.S.-led war in Iraq and the severe acute respiratory syndrome
outbreaks that occurred between March and June.</P>
      <P>Lin said that fixed investment growth in the private sector was
minus 11.5 percent, while public construction growth was minus 7.8
percent, so that the economic growth in the second quarter was minus
0.08 percent, or the first negative growth since the fourth quarter
of 2001.</P>
      <P>He added that it has been estimated that economic growth this
year will be between 3.15 percent and 3.2 percent, lower than the
targeted 3.52 percent.</P>
      <P>Lin also said that consumer prices in 2001 and 2002 dropped by
0.01 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively, with an estimated drop in
2003 of 0.28 percent.</P>
      <P>After three consecutive years of drops in consumer prices, there
is potential for deflation pressure, which makes an expansion of the
government's fixed investment crucial, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN VOWS TO FURTHER PROMOTE TIES WITH CHAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday the
ROC government will continue promoting cooperation with the Central
African ally of Chad for mutual benefits.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with Chadian Prime Minister
Moussa Faki Mahamat, who is currently on an official visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said he is pleased to see Taiwan-Chadian cooperative
programs proceed smoothly and successfully. The two infrastructure
projects -- the Taiwan Boulevard and the Unity Bridge -- completed in
Chad late last year epitomize the success in bilateral cooperation,
he added.</P>
      <P>At the moment, Chen said, Taiwan-financed projects are been
carried out in 26 of Chad's 28 provinces. All of Taiwan's financial
aid to Chad has been used to help improve Chadian people's
livelihood, Chen said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the president went on, Taiwan has posted medical and
technical missions in Chad to offer health care services and assist
in the African ally's agricultural development.</P>
      <P>Chen congratulated Faki on Chad's becoming an oil exporting
country in July this year. "Oil exports will definitely contribute to
your country's overall development," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He also expressed his gratitude for Chad's staunch support for
Taiwan's cause in the international arena. Top Chadian leaders,
including President Idriss Deby and Prime Minister Faki, have on many
international occasions spoken for Taiwan's bid to join the United
Nations and the World Health Organization.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN GOLF PRODIGY RETURNS FOR VACATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan-born golf prodigy Candie Kung, who
won three victories on the LPGA tour this year, has returned to
Taiwan for a brief winter break.</P>
      <P>Kung, 22, won her first LPGA title at the 54-hole 2003 Takefuji
Classic held in Las Vegas April 19 with a 12-under-par 204 (67, 67,
70) , two strokes ahead of Annika Sorenstam -- the world's top woman
player -- and two others. Kung held a news conference Monday under
the auspice of the Golf Association of the Republic of China (GAROC).</P>
      <P>GAROC Chairman Wang Yung-tsai, who is one of the executives of
Taiwan's petrochemical giant, the Formosa Group, offered Kung a
scholarship of NT$10 million (US$294,118) as a "homecoming gift" to
be used to assist her training in the United States.</P>
      <P>Prior to the news conference, Kung teed-off with Wang and other
Taiwan entrepreneurs at a local golf club. According to Wang, Kung is
polite but serious and concentrates when playing golf. "The sky's the
limit for this young lady," he said.</P>
      <P>Taking home US$165,000 from the Takefuji Classic, Kung now ranks
sixth on the LPGA's top-10 earnings list, with more than US$186,000.
She joined the LPGA tour last year.</P>
      <P>Kung moved from Taiwan to the United States with her parents when
she was 15. She is a three-time American Junior Golf Association
All-American and was named 1999 AJGA Player of the Year. She won the
2001 U.S. Public Links Championship.</P>
      <P>At the news conference, Kung said she is proud to be Taiwanese,
adding that the first words she said upon winning the LPGA title
were, "I'm from Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Kung said that she had missed out a lot during her high school
years because she had to practice golf. Her dislike for golf turned
into a sense of responsibility after she entered university, she
said, adding that she understood that golf would be her career.</P>
      <P>She said during her years as a professional golfer, her parents
and brother have been her greatest supporters. She said she owes a
lot, particularly to her father, who always fixes her a big meal he
cooks at home after a tournament.</P>
      <P>She said she has lots to learn besides honing her skills,
including learning to concentrate and learning to persevere to the
last minute. "Annika Sorenstam is my idol and the person that I hope
to outperform," she said.</P>
      <P>Kung will have a tight schedule in Taiwan. She met with former
President Lee Teng-hui, who likes to play golf, Monday afternoon, and
will meet with President Chen Shui-bian at the Presidential Office
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In addition to a meeting with Master Cheng Yen, founder of the
Buddhist Compassionate Relief Tzu Chi Foundation Wednesday, she is
also scheduled to lecture at a workshop for young golfers in Taiwan
and their parents on Saturday, among other activities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP SURVEY SHOWS CHEN AND LIEN RUNNING EVEN IN PRESIDENTIAL RACE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Incumbent President Chen Shui-bian of the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is in a dead heat for reelection
against his opponent, Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan, according
to a new poll conducted by the ruling party, a DPP spokesman said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Spokesman Wu Nai-jen also said that the DPP's latest move to
target KMT's allegedly ill-gotten assets is "positive" to the
campaign.</P>
      <P>A China Times newspaper poll Monday showed support for Lien and
his running mate People First Party Chairman James Soong at 36
percent, compared with Chen and his partner, Annette Lu, at 31. When
asked about the newspaper poll, Wu said he had no comment.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the DPP won a few elections over the past years, but
the party had never led in any polls conducted by the media, adding
that he doubted the credibility of the media based on his past
experience.</P>
      <P>He also said that the campaign to force the KMT to deal with its
illegally obtained assets is a good strategy, since the KMT has tried
to deal with the matter in a misleading way, such as with KMT
headquarters in downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>President Chen said Sunday that he did in fact approve and issue
the licence for the KMT headquarters building during his stint as
Taipei mayor, but this does not mean that the land was legally
obtained by the KMT.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the DPP is now producing campaign literature on the
KMT's ill-gotten assets, and the party will strive to let others know
that the licence for the building and how the land was acquired are
two different issues.</P>
      <P>He claimed that the DPP has tracked down all of the KMT's assets,
and that it will continue to push for the party to return them to the
rightful owners.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC VICE DEFENSE MINISTER WRAPS UP U.S. VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec. 21 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Vice Minister of National Defense
Lin Chon-pin left Washington, D.C. for home Sunday after wrapping up
a visit to the U.S. capital.</P>
      <P>Unlike a similar visit six months ago, Lin did not meet with U.S.
Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul D. Wolfowitz because he was on
vacation in California.</P>
      <P>A U.S. official denied that bilateral military exchanges have
been hindered by disputes over Taiwan's plan to hold a "defensive
referendum" on the day of its next presidential election March 20,
2004. The referendum seeks to give the people of Taiwan a venue to
voice their opposition to the deployment by mainland China of nearly
500 ballistic missiles targeting locations in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The official cited the convening of a seminar on the Taiwan
Strait situation in Hawaii on Dec. 15 to back his claim that
Taiwan-U.S. military exchanges have not been affected by the
referendum dispute.</P>
      <P>Previous media reports said the United States had canceled the
seminar to express its displeasure at Taiwan's referendum plan. Some
reports mistakenly described the seminar as a Taiwan-U.S. joint
computer war simulation and alleged that Lin had been barred from
attending the event because of the referendum issue.</P>
      <P>All those reports were untrue, the U.S. official said, adding
that the seminar was held as originally scheduled and that Lin was
not supposed to take part in the seminar from the very beginning.</P>
      <P>An American China hand said Taiwan-U.S. military exchanges are
not expected to be adversely affected by political relations between
the two countries at least for the time being. It is not easy to
suddenly put the brakes on the increasingly closer Taiwan-U.S.
military cooperation, the expert noted.</P>
      <P>Some U.S. officials in charge of relevant affairs said bilateral
military cooperation not only benefits Taiwan's national defense but
also U.S. interests.</P>
      <P>However, some other U.S. scholars pointed out that military
cooperation could be the first target if the Bush administration
really intends to cool its relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During his just-concluded visit, Lin headed a delegation of
military officials to attend a meeting on bilateral military
exchanges. Lin briefed U.S. officials on Taiwan's national defense
reforms, military restructuring and progress in its arms procurement
plans.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lin met with James Moriarity, outgoing senior
director for Asian affairs at the U.S. National Security Council, and
Michael Green, who will take over Moriarity's current post in
January, as well as State Department officials.</P>
      <P>Lin also exchanged views with scholars at major U.S. think tanks.
Sources said U.S. officials and academics had all expressed much
concern about Taiwan's referendum plan. Some scholars were quoted as
having said the planned referendum could cause tension in the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>During a news conference held after his meeting with mainland
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao at the White House earlier this month,
U.S. President George W. Bush said the United States is opposed to
Taiwan taking any unilateral action to change the status quo in the
region.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SARS PATIENT STEADILY RECOVERING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's only confirmed severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) patient this winter, Lt. Col. Chan, has
been steadily recovering from the killer disease, Taipei Municipal
Hoping Hospital officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>The 44-year-old Chan, who has been receiving treatment in a
negative-pressure ward at Hoping Hospital since last Wednesday, has
seen a remarkable increase in his blood's oxygen content, and his
lung inflammation has stopped increasing, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Hoping Hospital President Chu Ta-cheng said Sunday that Chan was
recovering satisfactorily, with his fever coming down several days
earlier and his diarrhea being brought under control. He has been
able to breathe without the use of a respirator since early Sunday
morning.</P>
      <P>The 15 people who had come into close contact with Chan were
removed from the watch list Sunday after not displaying any SARS
symptoms over the 10 previous days, Chu said.</P>
      <P>The Center for Disease Control (CDC) under the Cabinet-level
Department of Health labeled Chan's case as "an isolated" case that
is unlikely to lead to more transmissions.</P>
      <P>Chan, a SARS virus researcher with the Institute of Preventive
Medicine (IPM) under the National Defense Medical College, is
believed to have contracted SARS at work Dec. 5 when he touched
spilled SARS samples with his bare hands after analysis work that was
part of SARS virus research at a top-level P4 laboratory in which the
use of gowns and gloves is mandatory.</P>
      <P>He then flew to Singapore for an academic conference along with
five co-workers Dec. 7 and began to feel fatigue the next day while
in Singapore, but did not develop fever which is typical of SARS.</P>
      <P>Chan returned to Taiwan Dec. 10, and by that night, had developed
a fever of 38.5 degrees Celsius. His wife took him to see a doctor
near their house in Hsintien the next day. At that time, nobody
suspected him of having SARS, even though his job involved working
with the SARS virus.</P>
      <P>Another full week was allowed to pass before he was sent to
hospital Dec. 16 after developing diarrhea. At the hospital, Chan
underwent tests that confirmed the SARS virus was present in his
system.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori
is scheduled to arrive in Taiwan Thursday for a three-day private
visit, a Japanese daily reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Mori, who was prime minister between April 2000 and April 2001,
told reporters in Tokyo Monday that his upcoming Taiwan visit would
be purely private in nature. The itinerary will include a visit to an
old friend of his late father and rendezvous with people in Taiwan's
sports and economics circles, the Asahi Shimbun quoted Mori as
saying.</P>
      <P>According to the report, some Beijing officials have expressed
concern over the nature of Mori's upcoming visit to Taiwan on the
grounds that the former Japanese prime minister has just recently
visited Beijing. Mori was in the mainland capital Dec. 14-16.</P>
      <P>Mori, 66, was elected prime minister by the two houses of the
Japanese Diet in early April 2000, succeeding Keizo Obuchi who was in
a coma at the time after suffering a stroke.</P>
      <P>In the vote, Mori, who had served as secretary-general of Japan's
ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), was supported by the LDP, the
Komei Party and the Conservative Party. He retained all the Cabinet
ministers of the Obuchi administration.</P>
      <P>Mori, who had also served as Japan's minister for international
trade and industry in the past, has been very friendly toward Taiwan.
Taiwan-Japanese relations improved during the Mori administration.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FRAMEWORK PROPOSED FOR TAIWAN TO JOIN REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  23 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan could join in regional economic
integration under a closer economic operation framework (CEOF) , a
renowned economist suggested Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Addressing a luncheon party of the Chinese National Association
of Industry and Commerce, Vincent Siew, chairman of the Chung-Hua
Institution for Economic Research, said that Taiwan could avoid
political interference and maintain its competitiveness by joining
the regional economic integration under the name of CEOF instead of a
closer economic partnership agreement (CEPA) or a free trade
agreement(FTA).</P>
      <P>Siew, who also serves as chief of an economic advisory panel to
President Chen Shui-bian, said Asia has apparently entered a heated
regional economic integration season since October, with a series of
economic meetings by leaders of the countries in the region,
including a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) , a Japan-ASEAN summit in Tokyo, an Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) Forum leaders' meeting in Bangkok, and a Boao
Forum for Asia in Hainan, mainland China.</P>
      <P>Faced with this new trend, the former premier suggested that
Taiwan should become a free trade zone where all enterprises and
economies around the world would be willing to operate their
businesses, in addition to actively participating in World Trade
Organization (WTO) activities and seeking to sign free trade
agreements with other countries.</P>
      <P>At present, Siew said, Taiwan should focus its efforts on FTA
talks with the United States, Japan and its diplomatic allies in
Latin America.</P>
      <P>The country should also seek to sign an agreement with mainland
China similar to an FTA that would be mutually beneficial, although
it would be difficult under the existing situation, Siew added.</P>
      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait should first establish mutual
trust in order to achieve this goal, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SARS PATIENT RECOVERING WELL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 21 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's only SARS patient, identified only
as Lt. Col. Chan, has got through the most dangerous period of the
infection and is recovering well, Hoping Municipal Hospital officials
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>It is believed that the patient, a researcher at the Institute of
Preventive Medicine of the National Defense University in Taipei,
inadvertently infected himself with the SARS virus in his research
laboratory earlier this month.</P>
      <P>Since Chan was confirmed as having contracted the disease Dec 17,
the health authorities have put 34 people known to have come into
close contact with Chan since Dec. 7 on a watchlist to monitor their
health for at least ten days.</P>
      <P>Hoping Hospital Vice President Huang Lien-chi said Tuesday that
Chan no longer requires additional oxygen but is still partially on a
respirator.</P>
      <P>Huang added that Chan will have to remain under observation at
the hospital for one or two more days.</P>
      <P>Chan had suggested that the medical team use the medicine he had
developed in the lab, but the team did not adopt the idea, pointing
out that there is a big gap between lab experiments and human
testing, according to Huang.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hoping Hospital executives decided to downgrade the
guard level in its emergency room from degree 2 to degree 1.</P>
      <P>In addition to the self-health management and home quarantine,
the Center for Disease Control under the Cabinet-level Department of
Health has also implemented a series of control measures for those
who came into contact with Chan, which means they are not allowed to
travel abroad during the quarantine period.</P>
      <P>Travelers with fever are only allowed to depart from Taiwan if
they get a health certificate to prove they are not infected with
SARS, while airline companies have been asked to conduct strict fever
screening on their crew members.</P>

      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun ordered the formation
of an ad hoc panel Tuesday to deal with assets relinquished to the
government by the opposition Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>The panel will consist of representatives from the Ministry of

      <P>It will study procedures through which to take delivery of eight

      <P>In a related development Tuesday, Huang Chu-wen, chairman of the

illegally during its five-decade rule of the island.</P>
      <P>Huang noted that he served in the KMT before and claimed that he

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 23 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The average ratio of non-performing loans
(NPLs) of domestic banks had dropped to 5.01 percent as of November,
and the government's target of keeping the ratio below 5 percent is
expected to be reached before the end of this year, an official of
the Ministry of Finance (MOF) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Tseng Kuo-lie, director of the MOF Bureau of Monetary Affairs,
said the target forms part of President Chen Shui-bian's plan to cut
the NPL ratio of domestic banks to under 5 percent and to raise the
capital adequacy ratio to above 8 percent within two years.</P>
      <P>MOF statistics show that NPLs accumulated by 51 domestic banks
had reached NT$716.9 billion (US$21.08 billion) as of November,
registering an NPL ratio of 5.01 percent, a drop of 3.03 percentage
points from the 8.04 percent registered in the first quarter of last
year, a record high.</P>
      <P>Among the 51 banks, 34 banks registered NPL ratios below 5
percent, while nine banks had NPL ratios of between 5 percent and 10
percent. Eight banks suffered NPL ratios of more than 10 percent in
November.</P>
      <P>The statistics also show that during the January-November period,
domestic banks sold bad loans worth NT$1.168 trillion, which
demonstrates the efforts made by these banks to decrease their NPL
ratios.</P>
      <P>Tseng expressed gratitude to the financial institutions for their
efforts to improve their financial structures. However, to those that
have not yet reached the target, the bureau said these banks might
face some degree of punishment according to a financial reform ad-hoc
group's suggestion, such as reshuffles of boards of directors and
supervisors and general managers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT INSISTS ON CONTINUED REFORM FOR WORKERS, UNDERPRIVILEGED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  23 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian pledged Tuesday
that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will continue with
reforms in order to build a society in which justice and fairness are
fully served for workers and the underprivileged.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at the weekly meeting of the DPP Central
Standing Committee in his capacity as party chairman.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by the Cabinet-level Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, Chen reported that
Taiwan's jobless rate in November fell to 4.71 percent, down 0.21
percentage points from the October level and the lowest monthly
record since July, 2001.</P>
      <P>The president hailed the outstanding performance and attributed
the result to the all-out efforts made by the government and people
of Taiwan. He said Taiwan's November unemployment rate is lower than
Germany's 10 percent, France's 9.7 percent, Hong Kong's and Canada's
7.5 percent and Singapore's and the United States' 5.9 percent.</P>
      <P>Chen said he is confident of increasing the country's budgets for
research and development programs to account for more than 3 percent
of its gross domestic product by 2006, reducing the unemployment rate
to less than 4 percent by 2005 and lifting its economic growth rate
to over 5 percent in 2004, if he wins a second term in the March
presidential election.</P>
      <P>However, he lamented that the many grassroots workers -- the
behind-the-scene heroes of Taiwan's economic miracle -- have not been
fairly treated with dignity over the past few decades.</P>
      <P>In an effort to live up to the promises made to the workers, the
DPP-led government has tried to resolve the problems by making
adjustments to the existing systems, including establishing and
amending the Gender Equality Employment Law and the Labor Standards
Law, among others, he noted.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan will become a harmonious and progressive
society only when the workers are fairly treated, he vowed to face
the many challenges ahead with a firmer stance by seeking to create a
"win-win" situation for labor and management.</P>
      <P>The fruits obtained at the moment are just transitional and the
DPP will firmly stick to reform and justice as a means of throwing
its support behind the workers and the underprivileged, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT DOING UTMOST TO KEEP INAUGURAL PROMISES: AIDE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  23 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian is doing his
utmost to keep his inaugural promises to not attempt to change the
status quo in the Taiwan Strait, although he is no longer obliged to
do so, his chief of staff Chiou I-jen claimed Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Elaborating on the president's remarks the previous day that his
"five noes" inaugural promises "no longer" exist, Chiou said that
Chen made his promises in 2000 "as long as Beijing has no intention
of using force against Taiwan. " Beijing has never given up its
threat of force against Taiwan and accordingly, the president was not
bound by his promises.</P>
      <P>The president's patience is limited and Beijing should not expect
him to recede endlessly, Chiou warned.</P>
      <P>The president's remarks made headlines Tuesday, although their
political ramifications had not yet fully sunk in.</P>
      <P>Believing that the status quo is the basis of stability across
the Taiwan Strait, the United States has repeatedly said it takes the
president at his word and will disapprove of any attempt on either
side of the strait to change the status quo unilaterally.</P>
      <P>In a suggestion that a report in Monday's Ming Pao daily in Hong
Kong could be a political plot devised by Beijing, Chiou said Beijing
has been trying to influence the island's presidential election by
putting Chen out of favor.</P>
      <P>The Ming Pao said the previous day that Chen's revelation of the
number of Beijing's missiles targeting Taiwan Nov. 30 irritated
Beijing, which nabbed 36 Taiwanese spies already under its
surveillance in reprisal. The allegations have been denied by the
Taiwan authorities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEFENSE MINISTRY DENIES  SPY NETWORK CRACKED BY BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 23 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense
(MND) denied Tuesday that its spy network in mainland China had been
cracked by Beijing.</P>
      <P>MND spokesman Huang Suey-sheng said the report, first broken by
the Hong Kong-based Ming Pao daily on Monday, is not true and that
the domestic media should be careful about how they relay the story.</P>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun dismissed as unsubstantiated the paper's
report that Beijing had arrested 21 Taiwanese and 15 mainland Chinese
for spying for Taiwan since Nov. 30, when President Chen Shui-bian
said that Beijing has 496 missiles targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yu said Chen's information comes from satellite photos rather
than Taiwan spies and that the Ming Pao report is groundless.</P>
      <P>However, the report was supported by retired intelligence
official Chen Hu-men who claimed that the Military Intelligence
Bureau under the MND has lost contact with at least three of its
secret agents on the mainland.</P>
      <P>It was all grist to the mill for the opposition lawmakers in
their war of words with Chen in the lead up to the 2004 presidential
campaign. They claimed that the president has risked the lives of the
country's spies on the mainland by revealing the number of missiles
pointed at Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a rebuttal of the opposition lawmakers' criticism, several
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers Tuesday dismissed
the report as a political ploy hatched by the opposition with the
intention of tarnishing the president.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Lai Ching-teh said Chang Rong-gong, an opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) official in charge of mainland Chinese affairs,
visited the mainland five times in the last two months as an emissary
of KMT Chairman Lien Chan, who is running against Chen in the 2004
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lai suggested that Chang concocted the scheme with his Beijing
host during his mainland trips with the purpose of undermining Chen's
credibility.</P>
      <P>Another DPP lawmaker, Lin Chung-cheng, questioned the truth of
Chen Hu-men's claims, asking how someone who has been retired for
many years could know that the Military Intelligence Bureau had lost
contact with three agents.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Chiang Chao-yi said the whole thing is a scheme
cooked up by Beijing in the hope of boosting Lien's presidential
campaign.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun urged the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan to pass a special budget bill
for the government's 10 new major construction projects to boost
Taiwan's sustainable development.</P>
      <P>Yu made the call while presiding over a groundbreaking ceremony
for the Pali-Wuku section of a new expressway in Taipei County, which
is an integral part of the ambitious 10 new major construction
projects.</P>
      <P>"The groundbreaking ceremony marks the kickoff of the 10 new
major construction projects," Yu said, adding that the legislature
should pass the budget plan for the new infrastructure projects as
early as possible.</P>
      <P>The new expressway will link the Taipei Port on the northern
Taiwan coast to Taipei County's urban districts. Yu said the
expressway, scheduled for completion in March 2008, will help boost
Taipei Port's traffic volume and regional development.</P>
      <P>Noting that infrastructure construction is critical to economic
development and upgrading of national competitiveness, Yu said the
legislature should not stonewall the passage of the special budget
bill for the 10 new major construction projects which call for
capital investment of NT$500 billion over the next five years.</P>
      <P>Yu said the government must increase capital investment as Taiwan
faces potential pressure of deflation.</P>
      <P>According to a report delivered by Vice Premier Lin Hsin-i to
the legislature a day earlier, Taiwan's fixed investment has shown
negative growth since 2000. Fixed investment accounted for
7.3 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 1994, compared
with only 4.1 percent of the GDP in 2002.</P>
      <P>Government investment in recent years has continued to fall,
which Lin said has not only seriously affected the growth potential
of the economy, but has become a major factor in blocking economic
growth. With a view to sustaining Taiwan's economic development, Lin
told lawmakers that expansion of government's capital investment is
urgent and crucial and that the 10 new major construction projects
are part of the administration's efforts to resolve the plight.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that
Taiwan sporting talent is shining in the international sports arena,
showing that although the country is small, it has big ambitions.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he received Taiwan-born
golfer Candie Kung, a three-time winner on the LPGA tour this year.</P>
      <P>The president lauded Kung for her courage and confidence in
"always having Taiwan on her mind and making it visible to the
world."</P>
      <P>He noted that Kung emigrated with her parents to California when
she was 14 and that she still holds a Republic of China passport.</P>
      <P>Kung carries an ROC national flag with her in every game and
shows it to the media at post-tournament press conferences, proudly
proclaiming that "I come from Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The president noted that the LPGA was founded in 1950 and that
although six Taiwan players have tried to make their marks on the
tour, only Kung and Cheng Mei-chi have made it to the top.</P>
      <P>Kung took three wins in a period of five months, setting a
historic record for Taiwan golfers, the president said.</P>
      <P>The president said that not only has Taiwan excelled in the
production of golf equipment, but also a "Taiwan female Tiger" is
emerging, referring to top golfer Tiger Woods.</P>
      <P>"Kung is the pride of the 23 million people of Taiwan, " the
president said.</P>
      <P>Citing the examples of sprinter Chi Cheng and decathlete Yang
Chuang-kuang and more recently the baseball players Chen Chin-feng
and Tsao Chin-hui, the president said that "Taiwan-made" is indeed
good quality.</P>
      <P>He also noted that there are many other sportsmen and women
waiting for their chance to shine and that they need more business
support and government assistance.</P>
      <P>He said that he was gratified to learn that Formosa Plastics
Chairman Wang Yung-ching and the Golf Association of the Republic of
China Chairman Wang Yung-tsai will contribute generously to set up a
Candie Kung development fund.</P>
      <P>The president said that the government will continue to encourage
top players and will provide assistance and training programs, hoping
for a development of golf through the efforts of the government and
private sectors.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BUSINESSES URGED TO USE OFFSHORE CROSS-STRAIT TRANSSHIPMENT HUB</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Dec.  23 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Domestic companies should use the
offshore cross-Taiwan Strait transshipment hub located at Kaohsiung
Port more frequently for value-added processing and direct sailing to
and from mainland China to upgrade their industrial levels and global
competitive edge, government authorities said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to a spokesman for the Economic Processing Zone
Administration under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan-based
businesses should take more advantage of the center located at the
southern Taiwan port to process their semi-finished products from
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan investors can assemble, test, pack and label their parts
and components as well as complete their semi-finished products
manufactured on the mainland at the hub and then re-export them to
third countries or areas, the spokesman explained, adding that
greater value will be added to their goods, allowing them to chalk up
greater profits on lowered production costs and a more efficient
cross-strait labor division model.</P>
      <P>Currently, more than 40 businesses based at various export
processing zones in Kaohsiung are using the hub to process their
parts and components produced in Fuzhou and Xiamen of the mainland's
Fujian Province, and they have thus achieved greater earnings by
re-exporting their fully finished goods from the center to the rest
of the world, the spokesman noted.</P>
      <P>The spokesman strongly suggested that Taiwan businesses use the
hub's facilities for sea, air or air-sea and sea-sea transport to
reduce the travel time of their merchandise made on the mainland on
the grounds that this would help them save between 17 percent and 24
percent on transport costs and further strengthen their international
competitiveness.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WINTER SARS CASE COULD AFFECT JAPANESE TRAVEL TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 18 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A recent case of severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) in Taiwan might affect the willingness of Japanese
tourists to visit Taiwan, sources from local travel agencies said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's tourism industry took a historic dive in April this
year, when the potentially deadly disease broke out in Taiwan, the
sources said, adding that the number of foreign tourists to Taiwan
did not rise until July, when the situation improved markedly.</P>
      <P>They pointed out, however, that the number of Japanese tourists
to Taiwan has rebounded to only about 40 percent of normal levels of
the past. The target set by the government -- to attract 2.1 million
tourists for the whole of 2003 -- remains some way off, they said.</P>
      <P>Under the current circumstances, a possible resurgence in the
number of Japanese tourists might take place within the next six
months later, even though it had been expected to happen in April
2004, the start of Japan's fiscal year, the sources predicted.</P>
      <P>Although the recent SARS case in a researcher at a military-run
institute has been proven to be an isolated one, the sources
expressed the hope that no more new infections will surface.
Otherwise, they warned, the government's campaign to double the
number of tourist arrivals to Taiwan by 2008 will suffer a fresh
setback.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The State Public Prosecutor-General's
Office of the Supreme Court formed a special task force Tuesday to
supervise the campaign against vote-buying and violence in the
upcoming presidential election.</P>
      <P>Addressing the inauguration ceremony, Minister of Justice Chen
Ding-nan said he hopes the public will join forces with law
enforcement authorities in fighting vote-buying and violence in the
presidential election to be held March 20, 2004.</P>
      <P>With less than 100 days to go before the vote, both the ruling
and opposition camps have stepped up their campaign activities and
Chen said he has already received reports about suspected vote-buying
in both northern and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I have forwarded the relevant information to the relevant
prosecution authorities for further investigation," Chen said, but he
declined to elaborate.</P>
      <P>Chen said all local citizens are welcome to provide leads to
vote-buying practices. The government is offering cash rewards
ranging between NT$500,000 and NT$15 million for those whose
information leads to convictions for vote-buying by the presidential
candidates themselves or their campaign aides. In the 2001
legislative elections, Chen said, one citizen received NT$10 million
in reward for offering leads that led to the conviction of a lawmaker
for vote-buying.</P>
      <P>The new supervisory team will be headed by State Public
Prosecutor-General Lu Ren-fa. Public Prosecutor-General Wu Kuo-i,
Taipei Prosecutor's Office chief Shih Mao-lin, National Police
Administration Director Chang Shih-liang and Yeh Mao-sheng, director
of the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau attended the
inaugural ceremony to signify their determination to root out
election vote-buying and violence.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taichung Prosecutor's Office in central Taian also
formed an action team Tuesday to investigate suspected election
vote-buying and violence. Twelve senior prosecutors have been
assigned to join the team.</P>

    <HEADLINE>1ST FEMALE COMPANY LEADER HEADS ENGINEERING TROOPS IN TRAINING DRILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taoyuan,   Taiwan,  Dec.  23  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC military publicly
displayed its highly advanced German-made M3 amphibious floating
bridges for the first time Tuesday in a training drill headed by a
young woman officer.</P>
      <P>Army Captain Lee Ya-ting commanded a company of engineering
troops under the Sixth Army Group in erecting and connecting three
50-meter floating bridges in the training exercise at the Shihmen
Reservoir in Taoyuan County, some 40 kilometers south of Taipei.</P>
      <P>Sixth Army Group Commander Lt. Gen. Hu Chen-fu said it usually
takes 15 minutes to erect a 50-meter floating bridge. Thanks to Lee's
skillful training and efficient leadership, the company completed the
bridge in just eight minutes. Hu said Lee deserved credit for her
company's selection as model company of the year.</P>
      <P>In the training drill, the engineering company used the
three-unit floating bridges to ferry an 11-ton CM21A1 armored
vehicle, a Hammer vehicle and a 15-ton truck as well as a group of
journalists and military officials through the Shihmen Reservoir.</P>
      <P>Lee, 27, is the first female company leader since the ROC Army
formed an engineering corps decades ago. A graduate of the Civil
Engineering Department of the Chinese Military Academy (CMA) in
southern Taiwan, Lee once traveled to Germany to receive 46 days of
professional training in erecting M3 amphibious floating bridges.</P>
      <P>The ROC Army purchased 22 M3 floating bridges in 1999. Taiwan is
the only Asian country to have acquired the amphibious equipment,
known as the most advanced of its kind in the world.</P>
      <P>In addition to transporting various kinds of military vehicles,
M3 floating bridges can also be used in emergency disaster relief
operations.</P>
      <P>The deputy commander of the floating bridge company is also a
woman officer, Lt. Kang Hsiao-lan. Kang, 24, is also a graduate of
the CMA's Civil Engineering Department.</P>
      <P>Lee and Kang are two of the few female officers to have assumed
commanding posts in regular combat units in the ROC military. Their
professionalism and dedicated working style have won them much
recognition and respect in the army, Hu said.</P>
      <P>Lee said she has not encountered special difficulties in
commanding the engineering company. "Gender is not a problem so long
as I give clear and definite orders, they can always be fulfilled
smoothly," she said.</P>
      <P>Kang echoed Lee's view, saying that most engineering troops are
obedient. "Gender has never hindered my leadership or work, " Kang
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Members of several homosexual groups and
human rights activists organizations urged the government Tuesday to
come up with a timetable for the enactment of a basic human rights
law, which will also protect the rights of gays and lesbians.</P>
      <P>The groups lodged their appeal in front of the headquarters of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , calling for concrete
and effective measures to be taken by the government to facilitate
legislation of a basic human rights law.</P>
      <P>Ashley Wu, publicity director of the Gay and Lesbian Hotline
Association, Taiwan, also appealed to the government for an inclusion
of gays and lesbians into the category of people entitled to the
benefits stipulated in the Statute Governing Artificial Aid
Reproduction, to allow them to have children of their own produced
artificially.</P>
      <P>Wu said President Chen Shui-bian has on many occasions advocated
a basic human rights law which legitimizes same-sex marriages and
other rights for the nation's homosexual citizens.</P>
      <P>The president's promises, however, have remained empty words,
with no sign of concrete actions, said Wu.</P>
      <P>Wu said if the government is indeed working on drafting the law,
it should let the people know the law's articles and stipulations and
allow the people concerned to provide their opinions.</P>
      <P>In related news, DPP Legislator Ho Shui-sheng offered his
apologies to Taiwan's homosexual citizens twice last Friday for his
remarks made the previous day that "same-sex marriages could cause
the annihilation of the nation."</P>
      <P>At two separate press conferences at the Legislative Yuan, Ho,
who represents Tainan County, bowed to express his apologies to the
public as well as the nation's gays and lesbians for his "wrongly
understood" remarks.</P>
      <P>Ho said he didn't mean to hurt gays and lesbians when he made the
remarks while speaking to Health Minister Chen Chien-jen about the
possible passage of a bill allowing for same-sex marriages. Ho said
he simply expressed his opposition to same-sex marriages from the
medical point of view.</P>
      <P>Ho, a member of the Legislative Yuan Health and Environment
Committee, urged public health officials not to allow marriages
between gays and between lesbians, saying that such marriages should
be prohibited because they could never produce offspring which are
needed for the nation's sustainable development.</P>

      <P>Republic of China Minister of Foreign
Affairs Eugene Chien reiterated Tuesday that Taiwan and the United
States have very smooth communication channels but admitted that
there are difficulties getting the message across regarding
referendum issues.</P>
      <P>The minister made the remarks while meeting the media at a
year-end news conference.</P>
      <P>In response to Washington's concerns over Taiwan's initiative to
hold what it calls a "defensive referendum, " Chien emphasized that
the communication channels between the two countries are very smooth.</P>
      <P>However, he said that differences exist between Taiwan and the
United States regarding the referendum, admitting that there are some
"communication difficulties."</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan considers that holding the referendum would
better the island's democratization, the minister said that the
United States on the other hand sees the referendum with a
consideration of regional security, peace and stability, and this
difference has caused "a discrepancy of opinion."</P>
      <P>Chien further said that his ministry will continue to communicate
with the United States and that he believes that Washington will
eventually understand Taiwan's referendum position in the future.</P>
      <P>Indicating that the U.S. State Department has divided Taiwan's
referendum into three categories -- independence and unification,
public policy and political meaning but without substantial results
-- and has expressed clearly its positions on such referendums, the
minister said that what the ministry should do is to better
communicate with the United States on the goal of Taiwan's "defensive
referendum" and the actions the island will take in the future.</P>
      <P>As to the names of the referendum that have been raised by
President Chen Shui-bian in the past few weeks -- from "defensive
referendum" to "peace referendum, , Chien said that the goal of
changing referendum names is to tell the international community and

Daimler-Chrysler Vans Hong Kong -- and have worked out a formula to
enable the cooperation with the Chinese partner -- Fujian Automotive

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A scientific space exploration rocket will
be launched from a base in southern Taiwan Tuesday evening as part of
the work of Taiwan's space program, according to an official from the
National Science Council (NSC).</P>
      <P>The space exploration rocket, the third of its kind to be built
by the military Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology (CIST),
will be launched in the evening from a CIST base located in Chiupeng,
Pingtung County, NSC Vice Chairman Hsieh Ching-chih said.</P>
      <P>The launching of the horizontal rocket, whose range is not in
excess of 300 kilometers, is mainly aimed at gaining better
observation capabilities of the earth's ionosphere, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Noting that objects placed in orbit under 300 km from the earth's
surface are highly prone to falling back to earth, Hsieh said that no
satellites fly in the region between 60 km and 400 km above the
earth's surface. This part of the ionosphere has long been referred
to in jest as an "uncharted zone," he said.</P>
      <P>The rocket will be carrying scientific instruments to explore and
measure the ionosphere. According to Hsieh, the first such rocket was
successfully launched about three years ago, but it did not carry any
research gear. The second rocket of its kind did carry such
equipment, but its launch two years ago failed, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's space program, under the charge of the NSC Space Program
Development Preparatory Office, is aimed at carrying out the

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States will pay more than NT$330
million (US$9.7 million) to rent a new site for the Taipei office of
the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) for 99 years, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The AIT is the U.S. top representative office in Taiwan in the
absence of formal diplomatic ties between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The MOFA said in a report that the lease on the AIT's current
office on Hsinyi Road will expire soon.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Council decided earlier that the present site of the
AIT office will be turned into a junior high school in June 30, 2004.
The United States then asked the MOFA to locate a new site for the
AIT office, with the former eventually selecting an empty lot of land
in Neihu, suburban Taipei.</P>
      <P>The MOFA carried out the task of obtaining ownership of the land,
which had been partially owned by the central government, the city
government and private individuals. It was purchased at an estimated
cost of more than NT$230 million.</P>
      <P>The United States will pay a lump sum of more than NT$330 million
to rent the land for 99 years, and it will also spend NT$160 million
on constructing a building on the site.</P>
      <P>Under the principle of reciprocity, the Republic of China
government has asked to rent the present Coordination Council for
North American Affairs, which is the counterpart of the AIT, in
downtown Taipei for 99 years at a price of more than NT$88 million.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI TO BEGIN RECYCLING KITCHEN WASTE FROM FRIDAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou presided over a
rally of municipal environmental workers and volunteers Tuesday in
preparation for the kick-off of the city's kitchen waste recycling
program Friday.</P>
      <P>Addressing the rally of more than 1,000 city street cleaners and
environmental volunteers, Ma said the kitchen leftover recycling
program will be the city's "second garbage disposal revolution."</P>
      <P>"The new measure will mark a step forward in achieving the city
government's ambitious goal of 'recycling all garbage and leaving no
landfills' by 2010," the mayor said.</P>
      <P>Ma added proudly that Taipei's first garbage revolution -- the
pay-by-bag garbage fee collection system launched in 2000 -- has been
very successful as the city's waste has since declined by 50 percent.</P>
      <P>At the moment, Ma said, kitchen leftovers account for about 30
percent of total waste. With the launch of kitchen waste recycling,
he said, the city's garbage will decrease further.</P>
      <P>Besides kitchen leftover recycling, Ma said, the most effective
way to reduce waste is to cut the source of garbage. "We should
cultivate the habit of ordering only exactly what we want to eat when
we eat out. When we eat at home, we should only prepare exactly what
we need, " he explained.</P>
      <P>Taipei will be Taiwan's first city to recycle kitchen waste. The
municipal Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB) urged city residents
to work in tune with the new recycling program and divide their
kitchen waste into two categories -- namely cooked food scraps which
can be used to feed hogs, and material that can be used as compost,
such as vegetable leaves and fruit peels.</P>
      <P>Cooked food scraps should be put into the special blue container
installed on each garbage truck, while compost material should be
thrown into the red container. In the initial stage, the EPB will
post environmental volunteers to garbage collection locations to
instruct residents on how to divide their waste.</P>
      <P>The EPB said it will launch a three-month publicity campaign from
Dec. 26 to rally public support for the kitchen waste recycling
program. After Feb. 26, those who mix their kitchen leftovers with
regular garbage will be fined between NT$1,200 and NT$6,000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DIRECT TRANSPORTATION WITH MAINLAND IS IMPORTANT: LEGISLATURE SPEAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  24 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Direct transportation links with the
mainland are vital for the country if it doesn't want to be
marginalized in the region, said Legislative Yuan President Wang
Jin-pyng Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In a news release issued by his office, Wang was quoted as saying
in a recent interview with an unidentified media outlet that without
direct transportation links with the mainland, there is no way for
the country to join the free trade zone consisting of the member
states of the Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN).</P>
      <P>While the country is divided over the issue of whether the island
should unite with or separate from mainland China, neighboring states
are undertaking an economic and political integration which has
heretofore not been seen in the past.</P>
      <P>The integration process, with ASEAN at the center, has included
mainland China, Japan, South Korea and India. It is transforming
ASEAN into an economic bloc rivaling the United States and the
European Union in size, Wang was quoted as saying in the interview.</P>
      <P>Countries which will not or cannot join the bloc will certainly
be squeezed out of the international market to the detriment of their
economic development, he said.</P>
      <P>Being shut out of the integration process in the region, Taiwan
will not only be shunned by foreign investors but also see the flight
of its own capital. Unless it improves its ties with the mainland,
Taiwan's economic development will slow and the country will be
marginalized, he said.</P>
      <P>The absence of direct transportation with the mainland has become
the biggest concern of many foreign businesses in Taiwan, according
to Wang. Multinational businesses are relocating their operations
hubs from Taiwan to other places, and add the pressure of competition
brought about by bilateral free trade pacts concluded between other
countries and a situation develops whereby Taiwan is slowly hemmed in
and unable to grow, he said.</P>
      <P>Both experience and logic tells us that Taiwan can accelerate its
economic development by riding on the economic coattails of mainland
China. If not, the country will risk having to sit on the sidelines
of the international community and could become a state of little
account, Wang warned.</P>
      <P>Noting that good relations with the mainland is an easy way for
Taiwan to play an active role in the international community, the
Wang said Taiwan should shelve its political differences with the
mainland and create an environment favorable to economic development
for both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  24  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui said
Wednesday that integrated circuits can been used for numerous
purposes, and this was why he was opposed to the investment by local
8-inch silicon wafer makers in mainland China when he was in power
before 2000.</P>
      <P>In a speech at Fu Jen Catholic University in Taipei on Taiwan's
economic development in the age of globalization, Lee stressed that
he would not want to find that the missiles Beijing point at Taiwan
contained integrated circuits manufactured by Taiwan companies.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that Taiwan is facing fierce competition from mainland
China, especially the challenge brought by Beijing's economic opening
policy. People cannot ignore mainland China's ambition to become the
world's largest factory, and then the world's biggest market, Lee
added.</P>
      <P>Referring to his "no haste, be patient" policy in limiting
mainland-bound investment when he was president, Lee said it was to
prevent the "magnetic effect" of mainland China and to ensure
Taiwan's leadership in certain industries.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, reports by many globally well-known
organizations, such as the Economist Intelligence Unit, Brown
University, the Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street Journal, have
shown that Taiwan's e-government, business environment, as well as
economic liberty evaluations have been among the bests in the world
in recent years, reflecting Taiwan's sound economic structure.</P>
      <P>Lee said Taiwan's economic structure is quite fine and there is
still much space for Taiwan to get loans to support its economic
development.</P>
      <P>On questions about the high unemployment rate since the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party took the helm of the country in 2000,
Lee noted that the inactive economy was affected by the global
economic recession.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's economic structure is sound, Lee predicted
that the domestic economy will improve gradually.</P>

      <P>An animal rights group said Wednesday the

      <P>The Life Conservationists Association said Taiwan has some 1.7

sterilized.</P>
      <P>"It is regrettable that the Council of Agriculture (COA) has

in 2002, while only sterilizing 7,750 strays.</P>
      <P>Asserting that killing animals is detrimental to human conscience
and civilization, the spokesman said the COA should modify its policy
toward stray dogs by replacing "catch and kill" with sterilization.</P>
      <P>"We need a more humane policy on stray animals and sterilization
is the best way to resolve the issue," he said, adding that local pet
lovers should also replace "purchasing dogs" with "adopting strays"

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  24 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Wednesday
that President Chen Shui-bian's remark on the number of ballistic
missiles in mainland China targeting Taiwan had not tipped off the
mainland to the whereabouts of Taiwan spies; rather, it was a
successful stroke of " defensive diplomacy."</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks while visiting a hospital in northern Taiwan.
The vice president said the president's comments, made on Nov. 30 in
an interview with the London-based Financial Times newspaper, has
drawn worldwide attention to Beijing's military threat against
Taiwan, and prompted the European Parliament to forbid its member
states from selling arms to Beijing.</P>
      <P>The president has achieved a diplomatic breakthrough by changing
the EU's view of mainland China, a feat which is almost impossible
through regular diplomatic channels because of the absence of
diplomatic ties between Taiwan and European states, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Beijing's military threat will become more serious because the
number of its missiles targeting Taiwan will increase to 650 next
year, Lu added.</P>
      <P>President Chen's critics had argued that the disclosure of the
number of Beijing's missiles jeopardized the country's intelligence
gathering operations in the mainland by alerting Beijing to what
Taiwan had learned about the missile deployment.</P>
      <P>Their accusations were boosted by a report in Monday's Ming Pao
Daily in Hong Kong that said Beijing has arrested 36 people for
allegedly spying for Taiwan in the mainland as a response to Chen's
remarks.</P>
      <P>However, government officials as well as Chen's supporters have
spoken out against the accusations, dismissing them as groundless or
as a political trick concocted by Beijing and its sympathizers in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>While inspecting the Taoyuan Hospital, Lu also criticized Beijing
for shamelessly claiming earlier this year that it had taken care of
Taiwan's medical needs when in fact it had done little to halt the
spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and had not even
bothered to apologize to the people of Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Taiwan should allow mainland Chinese
tourists to enter if the government hopes to inject a new lease on
life in the domestic tourism industry, a key economic advisor at a

      <P>Vincent Siew, a veteran economist and a vice chairman of the
major opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , who served as premier in the
previous KMT-led government from 1997-2000, said he will make the
suggestion to President Chen Shui-bian in a meeting slated for Friday
at which panel members will give advice to help promote Taiwan's
tourism and related education and training at domestic higher
learning institutes.</P>
      <P>Stating that the government must adopt adequate and concrete
measures to bolster Taiwan's tourism and resort industry, Siew said
that relevant government authorities should work out a clear-cut
policy and businesses in the sector must devise their own approaches
to target their clients.</P>
      <P>Siew added that he will suggest in the Friday meeting to help the
tourism businesses operating domestically and to have outbound travel
and inbound travel verify their markets and make programs to attract
potential customers.</P>
      <P>In line with the government's goal of doubling the number of
foreign tourist arrivals to Taiwan by 2008, Siew said that opening
the domestic market to tourists from mainland China will give a major
boost to the domestic tourism industry.</P>
      <P>As to a recent proposal he made regarding the signing of a closer
economic partnership arrangement between Taiwan and mainland China,
Siew said that such an accord will be in place only when politically
sensitive elements have been wiped out between the two sides of the

patrol boats stationed around the island group, which lies 114
nautical miles northwest of the northern port city of Keelung.</P>
      <P>Apart from one vessel for repairs and maintenance and two based
on Tungyin Island and one based on Chukuang Island, the official
explained that the remaining four are fully devoted to carrying out
routine patrol missions every day off the main island of Nankan,
commonly known as Matsu, as well as other islets such as Peikan and
Tungyin, among others.</P>
      <P>The official, however, also acknowledged that four patrol boats
are not enough to deal with serious situations or major incidents in
which additional patrol vessels and helicopters must be sent from
Taiwan proper to help intensify inspections.</P>
      <P>For instance, he said, Taiwan-based patrol ships took part in a
program in July and August last year off the Matsu Islands to help
fend off intruding fishing boats from the mainland and help protect a
special zone designated for an endangered bird.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, new types of monitoring radars have
recently been installed on the Nankan, Peikan, Chukuang and Tungyin
islands as part of the government's efforts to strengthen inspection
along the coast.</P>
      <P>As to a recent letter-to-the-editor printed by a local newspaper
saying that a mainland fishing boat entered port on Peikan Island, he
dismissed the incident as purely a "fishery dispute" and added that
the mainland boat was escorted by CGA vessels to leave
Taiwan-controlled waters after both sides reached a settlement
following an investigation by coast guard authorities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH ANNOUNCES SUSPENSION OF U.S. BEEF IMPORTS, RELATED PRODUCTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) announced
the suspension Wednesday of imports of U.S. beef, cattle carcasses,
organs, tissue and derived products such as placenta extract, in
response to the first suspected case of mad cow disease reported
in the United States a day earlier.</P>
      <P>But Chen Lu-hung, director-general of the DOH Bureau of Food
Sanitation, said U.S. milk and milk products will not be included for
the time being.</P>
      <P>A single Holstein cow on a Washington State farm has tested
positive for mad cow disease, marking the first appearance of the
disease in the United States.</P>
      <P>On whether U.S. beef products will be removed from Taiwan
shelves, Chen said that as very little beef is imported from
Washington State and the suspected case is a dairy cow, beef already
on the domestic market should be safe.</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) has also suspended imports of
U.S. live goats and feed made of goat parts. But Chen pointed out
that very little goat meat and mutton is imported from the United
States, so that U.S. goat meat and mutton are not included in the
suspension.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the beef suspension will affect beef supplies, Chen
pointed out that Taiwan still can import from Australia, New Zealand,
Canada and Paraguay.</P>
      <P>Chen said that according to general practice, U.S. beef shipped
before Wednesday will not be affected by the ban and can be imported
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to COA tallies, Australia and New Zealand are Taiwan's
two largest sources of beef. Taiwan imported more than 35,000 tons of
beef and related products from Australia in 2002, 15,400 tons from
New Zealand and 13,900 tons from the United States. Canada was the
fourth-largest supplier, with 3,800 tons. Other beef sources include
Panama and Paraguay.</P>
      <P>Mad cow disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy,
eats holes in the brains of cattle. It first sprang up in Britain in
1986 and spread through countries in Europe, prompting massive
slaughter of herds and decimating the European beef industry.</P>
      <P>A form of mad cow disease can be contracted by humans through
eating infected beef or nerve tissue, and possibly through blood
transfusions. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- the human form of mad cow
disease -- has so far killed 143 people in Britain and 10 elsewhere.
No one in the United States has died from the disease.
People who are possibly at risk for the disease are banned from
donating blood.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BUSINESSMEN MISSING ON MAINLAND NOT MND WORKERS: MND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  24  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Defense Minister Tang Yiau-min said
Wednesday none of several people allegedly nabbed by mainland Chinese
intelligence authorities recently are staff members of the Ministry
of National Defense (MND).</P>
      <P>Cabinet spokesman Lin Chia-lung quoted Tang as having issued a
three-point statement at a weekly Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>First of all, Tang said, after undergoing verification, the list
of Taiwanese businessmen alleged by local media as having gone
missing on the mainland recently does not include any MND employees.</P>
      <P>For the sake of protecting intelligence agents' safety, Tang
said, government authorities around the world traditionally do not
publicly discuss issues concerning intelligence personnel. In the
future, Tang said, the MND will consistently give a "no comment"
reply to all intelligence-related inquiries.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Tang stressed that the MND has adopted appropriate
measures to protect intelligence staff's safety, rights and
interests as providing care and protection for intelligence agents is
the government's duty.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin urged local media and opposition lawmakers to
refrain from describing the missing of certain mainland China-based
Taiwan businessmen as a case concerning espionage.</P>
      <P>Lin said the government will look into reports about the missing
Taiwan businessmen operating on the mainland and will assist their
families in dealing with relevant affairs.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a report by Beijing's official Xinhua News Agency
earlier in the day that mainland security authorities have arrested
24 Taiwanese and 19 mainland Chinese on charges of spying for Taiwan,
Lin said the report was just a mainland ploy to undermine President
Chen Shui-bian's re-election bid.</P>
      <P>Lin reminded local people that the mainland authorities will make
every possible effort to sway Taiwan voters ahead of the island's
March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>He also urged Taiwan businessmen operating on the mainland to
exercise caution and prudence in their daily lives and business
operations, as it is all too common in a repressive country like
mainland China for security authorities to make arrests without
legitimate reasons.</P>
      <P>In a related development, Vice President Annette Lu also
dismissed the Xinhua report as an attempt to embarrass Chen ahead of
the election.</P>
      <P>"Let's not believe in rumors, " Lu said during a campaign
appearance. "We all know that the Beijing authorities have all kinds
of strategies for dealing with Taiwan and interfering with our
elections."</P>
      <P>On Monday, Hong Kong's Ming Pao daily claimed that Chen exposed
36 of the island's spies on the mainland in a speech last month that
listed the locations of 496 mainland Chinese missiles pointed at
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The newspaper reported that the mainland authorities had arrested
21 Taiwanese and 15 Chinese nationals since mid-December on espionage
charges. It reported partial names for five of the Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, Taiwan's secretive Military Intelligence Bureau took
the unusual step of issuing a denial, saying: "To date, after
undergoing verification, we can say that none of our personnel have
been arrested by the Chinese communists."</P>
      <P>Chen's aides say the missile information came from satellites,
not intelligence personnel. They also say the mainland authorities
could not possibly have broken up a spy ring with such speed.</P>
      <P>Espionage accusations are frequently intertwined with Taiwan's
domestic politics.</P>
      <P>Four years ago, Beijing reportedly executed a mainland army
general and a colonel for selling secrets to Taiwan during military
exercises meant to intimidate the island ahead of its first-ever
direct presidential election in 1996.</P>
      <P>In that case, then-President Lee Teng-hui was accused of blowing
the Chinese officers' cover by claiming in a campaign speech that
Chinese missiles being launched into the Taiwan Strait were carrying
dummy warheads.</P>
      <P>In the latest allegations, opposition politicians have accused
Chen of endangering the military intelligence service by disclosing
the number and locations of mainland missiles targeting Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The authorities of southern Taiwan's
Kaohsiung Harbor are observing closely the operations of rival
harbors, as its former position as the world's third-largest
container port has been squeezed to No. 6.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Harbor was squeezed out by Busan in South Korea, and
Shanghai and Shenzhen in mainland China, according to statistics from
the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong is still the largest container port in the world,
followed by Singapore.</P>
      <P>In addition to the pressure from these harbors, Kaohsiung Harbor
has also encountered strong competition from domestic ports such as
Keelung, Taichung, Mailiao and Taipei.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  24  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Trong Chai of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Wednesday that more than
1,000 Taiwan businessmen operating in mainland China have been
arrested over the past three years and that the personal safety of
Taiwan businessmen there has become a serious problem.</P>
      <P>Chai and his colleagues Lin Chin-hsin, Chiang Chao-yi, Wang
Shu-huei and Lan Mei-chin also rebutted in a press release
allegations that Taiwan's spy network on the mainland was jeopardized
after President Chen Shui-bian's remarks on mainland Chinese missiles
targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, Premier Yu Shyi-kun dismissed as unsubstantiated a
Hong Kong-based paper's report that Beijing had arrested 21 Taiwanese
and 15 mainland Chinese for spying for Taiwan since Nov.
30, when President Chen said that Beijing has 496 missiles targeting
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, the Ming Pao daily report was supported by retired
intelligence official Chen Hu-men, who claimed that the Military
Intelligence Bureau under the Ministry of National Defense has lost
contact with at least three of its secret agents on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chai pointed out the unlikelihood that a former intelligence
officer who has been retired for 10 years would have up-to-date
knowledge of the latest developments in Taiwan's spy network on the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Instead, he said that more than 1,000 Taiwan businessmen have
been arrested over the past three years, not because they were spies
but because they were evading taxes.</P>
      <P>The legislators said that statistics released by the
semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation show that cases involving
the personal safety of Taiwan businessmen over the past two years
have also increased.</P>
      <P>They noted that there were 67 cases involving murder, accidental
death, accidental injury, robbery, extortion, blackmail, kidnapping
and restricting the freedom of movement of Taiwan businessmen in
2001, and 91 cases in 2002. The number of cases so far this year has
reached 80, showing the seriousness of the issue, the legislators
added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A reduction in the amount of gravel
extraction from eastern Hualien County could affect major public
works construction plans in the northern Taipei and Taoyuan regions,
informed sources reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>As a result of an environmental impact assessment being conducted
in the Hualien area, the number of ships transporting gravel from the
eastern county to Taipei Harbor in November dropped to 46 from
October's 61, a reduction of 66,000 tons of gravel, according to Lin
Hsin-chuan, a secretary at Taipei Harbor.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, gravel shipped from Hualien to Taipei is mainly
used for public work construction projects in the Greater Taipei and
Taoyuan areas.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by Taipei Harbor show that ships transported
gravel from Hualien to Taipei on 499 trips during the first 11 months
of this year. However, the volume of gravel shipped from Hualien to
Taipei fell by 66,000 tons in November alone.</P>
      <P>The major purpose of the building of Taipei Harbor is to handle

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  24 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's only confirmed severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) patient this winter, identified only as
Lt. Col. Chan, is making a steady recovery from the disease, Health
Minister Chen Chien-jen said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The 44-year-old Chan, who has been receiving treatment in a
negative-pressure ward at Hoping Municipal Hospital since Dec. 17,
has been declared out of critical condition, Chen quoted Hoping
officials as saying.</P>
      <P>If everything goes smoothly, Chan is expected to be discharged
from the hospital before the end of December, said Hoping Hospital
President Chu Ta-cheng.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan interpellation session,
Chen said that the country has learned a lesson from Chan's case,
particularly that P3 and top-level P4 laboratories should have more
efficient management and implementation of security and safety
measures.</P>
      <P>Chan, a SARS virus researcher with the Institute of Preventive
Medicine (IPM) under the National Defense Medical College, is
believed to have contracted SARS at work Dec. 5 when he touched
spilled SARS samples with his bare hands after analysis work that was
part of SARS virus research at an IPM top-level P4 laboratory in
which the use of gowns and gloves is mandatory.</P>
      <P>The IPM P4 lab, the only one of its kind in Taiwan, was closed
down temporarily Dec. 17 after Chan was confirmed positive for SARS.
With the closure of the lab, all public and private laboratories
conducting SARS research in Taiwan were also ordered to shelve their
operations with immediate effect.</P>
      <P>Chen said the P4 lab has been conducting an overall sterilization
job in the wake of the infection, while the Department of Health
(DOH) invited specialists from the United States to Taiwan to provide
lessons for Taiwan researchers working at SARS laboratories on
security, safety and related policies.</P>
      <P>The P4 lab, as well as other SARS research labs, are not expected
to resume their operations until March, Chen added.</P>
      <P>According to Center for Disease Control (CDC) officials, 15 of
the people who had come into close contact with Chan prior to his
hospitalization were removed from a SARS watchlist earlier this week
after not displaying any SARS symptoms over the 10 previous days.</P>
      <P>The CDC has from the beginning labeled Chan's case as "an
isolated" one that is unlikely to lead to more transmissions.</P>
      <P>Chan flew to Singapore for an academic conference along with five
co-workers Dec. 7 and began to feel fatigue the next day while in
Singapore, but did not develop the fever that is typical of SARS.</P>
      <P>He returned to Taiwan Dec. 10, and by that night, had developed a
fever of 38.5 degrees Celsius. His wife took him to see a doctor near
their house in Hsintien the next day. At that time, nobody suspected
him of having SARS, even though his job involved working with the
SARS virus.</P>
      <P>Another full week was allowed to pass before he was sent to
hospital Dec. 16 after developing diarrhea. At the hospital, Chan
underwent tests that confirmed the SARS virus was present in his
system.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAUNCH OF SPACE EXPLORATION ROCKET POSTPONED: NSC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A scientific space exploration rocket will
be launched from a base in southern Taiwan Wednesday evening, one day
later than its original schedule, officials from the Cabinet-level
National Science Council (NSC) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The launch was postponed when an unidentified vessel intruded
unexpectedly into the restricted sea area that was zoned for the
launch, coupled with bad weather, NSC officials said.</P>
      <P>The space exploration rocket, the third of its kind to be built
by the military Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology (CIST),
will be launched from a CIST base located in Chiupeng, Pingtung
County, NSC officials went on.</P>
      <P>The launch of the rocket, whose range is not in excess of 300
kilometers, is mainly aimed at gaining a better observation of the
earth's ionosphere, NSC Vice Chairman Hsieh Ching-chih said a day
earlier.</P>
      <P>Noting that objects placed into orbit less than 300 km from the
earth's surface are highly prone to falling back to earth, Hsieh said
that no satellites are orbiting in the region between 60 km and 400
km from the earth's surface. This part of the ionosphere has long
been referred to in jest as an "uncharted zone," he said.</P>
      <P>The rocket will be carrying scientific instruments to explore and
measure the ionosphere. According to Hsieh, the first such rocket was
successfully launched about three years ago, but it did not carry any
research gear. The second rocket did carry such equipment, but its
launch two years ago failed, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's space program, under the charge of the NSC Space Program
Development Preparatory Office, is aimed at carrying out the
research, development and launch of basic space exploration rockets
before 2009 and of multi-functional space exploration rockets by
2018, he noted.</P>
      <P>The CIST builds and launches the rockets under a contract signed
with the NSC Space Program Development Preparatory Office at a cost
of NT$25 million (US$735,294) per unit, he said.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese maritime research vessels have been discovered
operating in areas very close to Taiwan's economic waters on more
than 12 occasions over the past year and an official Website of the
mainland Chinese authorities has been found to have closely monitored
Taiwan's space development program and reported every relevant
activity in detail on its Website, including the rocket launches.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAPAN STUDIED FEASIBILITY OF TWO-CHINA POLICY IN 1960S: DOCUMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,   Dec.   24  (CNA)
(By C.N. Chieh and P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Japan paid much attention to the
cross-Taiwan Strait question in the 1960s and looked into the
possibility of adopting a "two-China" policy, according to a
confidential document released Wednesday by the Japanese Ministry of
Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>The document said that although the Japanese government insisted
on its "one-China" policy on the surface at that time, it also
studied the feasibility of adopting a "two-China" policy.</P>
      <P>In December 1964, then Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato said
while receiving a British envoy to Japan that officially, his
government only recognizes one China and sticks to the policy only
because both mainland China and Taiwan insist there is only one
China, according to the document.</P>
      <P>Sato stressed that he himself knows clearly there are two regimes
that coexist in China, the document said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, then Japanese Foreign Affairs Minister Ohira Masayoshi
said at a Japan-U.K. meeting held in May, 1964 that Japan hopes that
Taiwan will be able to keep its seat in the United Nations if
mainland China joins the organization, according to the document.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the document revealed that around the same time, the
then British minister of foreign and commonwealth affairs indicated
that London believes that in dealing with the China question, Taiwan
and mainland China should be handled separately. He even suggested
that Taiwan's Nationalist government should abandon its unrealistic
mentality of still being the ruler of all of China, according to the
document.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SUSPENDS U.S. BEEF PRODUCT IMPORTS OVER MAD COW FEARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan suspended imports of U.S. beef and
related products Wednesday after the first suspected case of cattle
infected with mad cow disease was reported in the United States a day
earlier.</P>
      <P>A single Holstein on a Washington State farm has tested positive
for mad cow disease, marking the disease's first suspected appearance
in the United States.</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) said the government has decided
to suspend U.S. beef and goat product imports for the time being now
that Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Malaysia have indefinitely
banned such U.S. imports.</P>
      <P>Chiang Yi-nan, director of the COA's Animal and Plant Inspection
and Quarantine Bureau, said U.S. beef and goat products, including
powdered bones, that may spread mad cow disease will all be banned
from entering Taiwan for the time being.</P>
      <P>Chiang said it will take a few more days to determine whether the
United States will be declared a mad cow disease-affected area.
Inspection of contaminated samples takes three to five days to
complete.</P>
      <P>According to the World Organization for Animal Health, a mad cow
disease-affected country is prohibited from exporting beef and
related products for at least seven years.</P>
      <P>Britain has not resumed beef exports since a mad cow disease
outbreak several years ago.</P>
      <P>The United States has been the third largest beef import source.
The import ban is expected to push up local beef prices. But Chiang
said the price hike should not be too drastic because local
importers can import more beef from Australia and New Zealand to meet
the market demand.</P>
      <P>Australia and New Zealand have been Taiwan's two largest beef
import sources. According to COA tallies, Taiwan imported more than
35,000 tons of beef and related products from Australia in 2002;
15,400 tons from New Zealand; and 13,900 tons from the United States.
Canada was the fourth largest supplier, with 3,800 tons. Other
beef import sources included Panama and Paraguay.</P>
      <P>Mad cow disease, known also as bovine spongiform encephalopathy,
eats holes in the brains of cattle. It sprang up in Britain in 1986
and spread through countries in Europe, prompting massive destruction
of herds and decimating the European beef industry.</P>
      <P>A form of mad cow disease can be contracted by humans by eating
infected beef or nerve tissue, and possibly through blood
transfusions. The human form of mad cow disease has so far killed 143
people in Britain and 10 elsewhere. No one in the United States has
died from the disease. People who are possibly at risk for the
disease are banned from donating blood.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number and value of bad checks in
November dropped from the October levels as a result of an improved
domestic economy, a spokesman for Taiwan's Central Bank of China
(CBC) said Friday.</P>
      <P>More than 10.21 million checks with a total value of about
NT$2.801 trillion (US$82.38 billion) were drawn in November, 43,247
checks of which, or 0.42 percent of the total, were bad checks with a
value of some NT$8.4 billion, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>Compared with the October levels, checks issued in November were
down by 26.3 percent and 15.69 percent in terms of total number and
value, respectively, while bad checks also fell by 0.01 percentage
points and 0.02 percentage points in number and value, the CBC
official elaborated.</P>
      <P>The official attributed the decreases to a better economic
situation at home over the past few months on the grounds that a
four-color economic gauge published by the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development has continued to flash green
uninterrupted since July.</P>
      <P>It is an indication that the improved economic situation has

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday
relevant government agencies should adopt more effective measures to
fuel an across-the-board economic recovery in order to further lower
the unemployment rate.</P>
      <P>Chen made the directives at a meeting of the president's economic
advisory panel headed by Vincent Siew, a vice chairman of the
opposition Kuomintang who once served as a premier in the previous
KMT administration.</P>
      <P>Chen said even though the nation's unemployment rate has
continued its downward streak in November, the number of jobless
people remains large.</P>
      <P>"Relevant government agencies should continue its current
job-creation programs and work out even more effective measures to
enhance the intensity of domestic economic recovery and
create more job," Chen said.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Chen also said he hopes the nation's
overall investment in research and development can be raised to 3
percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) by 2006. All responsible
government agencies should formulate detailed measures to realize
this goal.</P>
      <P>To cope with a steady decline in the population growth rate, Chen
said, tertiary education institutions should formulate an academic
mechanism and courses that are suitable for lifelong learning to meet
the high demand for trained professionals under the current
knowledge-based economy.</P>
      <P>The government should also encourage and promote
transformation of government-funded universities into independent
institutions to allow for more flexibility and access to more
resources, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government has set 2004 as the year for
tourism promotion, Chen said responsible government agencies should
pool resources with the private sector in promoting domestic travel
and attracting foreign tourists.</P>
      <P>Chen also called on Beijing to respond to Taiwan's goodwill in
opening its door to mainland Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>"We hope mainland China can lift its ban on its people's leisure
trips to Taiwan," Chen said, adding that Taiwan's responsible
agencies should step up negotiations with mainland authorities to
pay the way for ordinary mainland citizens to make sightseeing
trips to this island.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen stressed the importance of intellectual property
rights (IPR) protection. "IPR protection is our obligations
following our entry to the World Trade Organization and will also
benefit our industrial upgrading. We must further revise our
copyrights law and institutionalize the IPR investigative
police team and mete out harsher punishment to copyrights
violators," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KENTING NATIONAL PARK RELEASES MORE SIKA DEER INTO THE WILD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Pingtung,   Dec.  26  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kenting National Park, Taiwan's
southernmost national park, released 25 Formosan sika deer into the
wild Friday to mark the park's 20th founding anniversary.</P>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Yu Cheng-hsien presided over a ceremony
marking the deer release -- part of the park's sika deer
replenishment project which began in 1984.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, Yu said that Kenting National Park is a
unique national park where protection of natural scenery and deposits
of natural resources as well as wildlife conservation receive equal
attention.</P>
      <P>This was the fifth time since the park's inception in 1984 that
park officials have released a group of the protected animals which
are bred in the park.</P>
      <P>Beginning with a herd of 22 pure-bred Formosan sika deer -- or
Cervus nippon taiwanus -- donated by the Taipei Yuanshan Zoo in 1984,
Kenting park authorities have raised nearly 300 offspring of the core
herd.</P>
      <P>The park released a total of 98 of the indigenous deer in 1994,
1995, 1997 and 2002 into a forested area in the coastal county of
Pingtung. These animals have bred and now number around 300,
according to zoologists.</P>
      <P>The released deer are monitored by the zoologists with electronic
detectors planted under the skin of the animals. The raising of some
of the sika deer are also financially supported by rural township
governments in Pingtung County, zoo officials said.</P>
      <P>Deer skin from the Formosa sika deer was one of the most
important economic resources of the indigenous Taiwan people in the
17th, 18th and 19th centuries. The wild animal, however, came close
to extinction six decades ago due to excessive hunting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CITIZENS WELCOME TO MAKE SIGHTSEEING TRIPS TO TAIWAN: CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that
Taiwan is willing to open its door wider for mainland Chinese
citizens to make sightseeing trips to the island.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a meeting of the president's economic advisory panel,
Chen said his administration has lifted a ban on mainland citizens'
leisure trips to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"However, mainland China has so far been unwilling to ease its
stringent restrictions on its people's leisure trips to Taiwan. We
hope Beijing authorities can make a goodwill response to our
'open-door' appeal," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He also directed relevant government agencies to continue
consulting with mainland authorities on the issue based on the
principle of "openness."</P>
      <P>"I hope the policy initiative of allowing mainland people to make
sightseeing trips to Taiwan can be put into force as soon as
possible," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chiou I-jen, President Chen's chief of staff, said after the
meeting that mainland China still lists Taiwan as an off-limits area
for its people intending to make overseas leisure trips.</P>
      <P>"So long as China lifts its ban, Taiwan will have its door wide
open for mainland tourists, " Chiou said, adding that the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) has worked out many
complementary measures in preparation for mainland China's
deregulation.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has opened its door for mainland citizens residing in
foreign countries with "permanent residency" status as well as those
in Hong Kong and Macau and mainland students pursuing advanced
studies abroad to make leisure trips to Taiwan under the principle of
"groups in, groups out." Mainland people who make overseas visits are
also allowed to make leisure trips to the island on their way back to
the mainland.</P>
      <P>What local travel agents would most like to see is the government
open the door for ordinary mainland citizens to travel to Taiwan via
Hong Kong or Macau for sightseeing purposes.</P>
      <P>Chiou said if mainland China includes Taiwan on its list of
countries that its people can visit for sightseeing purposes, the MAC
will further ease regulations governing mainland people's leisure
trips, with only a few exceptions.</P>
      <P>"Except for several categories of mainland citizens such as those
in the military, most other mainland people will be allowed to make
leisure trips to Taiwan once the mainland lifts its ban, " Chiou
said.</P>
      <P>Travel agents said they welcome the government's "open door"
policy. Even if the government sets an annual quota of 365,000
ordinary mainland citizens to be allowed to make leisure trips here,
travel sources said, the move will contribute much to the
recession-hit local tourist industry. And the government's goal of
doubling the number of tourist arrivals in five years will then be
realized easier, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, local news media quoted mainland travel officials
as saying that mainland China is unlikely to allow its people to make
sightseeing trips to Taiwan before the two sides sign an agreement on
issues regarding travel insurance, visa processing, travel accidents,
travel disputes and the return of overstaying visitors. Mainland
officials said Taiwan should commission private travel agencies to
negotiate with the mainland as early as possible.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN LABORERS REDUCED TO BELOW 300,000 UNDER DPP WATCH: LAWMAKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) has reduced the number of foreign laborers to 297,000 -- down
32,000 from the peak -- over the past three years, DPP legislators
said Friday.</P>
      <P>The legislators made the remarks in response to criticism by
Legislator Ho Tsai-feng of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) . Ho
faulted the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) for easing the foreign
laborer policy at the expense of domestic workers.</P>
      <P>Ho said that the CLA announced Wednesday that it will once again
allow imports of foreign laborers in the construction sector after
freezing them for two years. Formosa Plastics Group's sixth naphtha
cracker project will be able to introduce 5,800 foreign laborers,
which Ho said will affect the employment opportunities of domestic
laborers, citing the jobless rate in November as 4.7 percent.</P>
      <P>But DPP Legislator Lai Chin-teh said that it was the KMT who
increased the number of foreign laborers every year during its reign,
adding that the number reached more than 330,000 at its peak.</P>
      <P>Lai stressed that the DPP introduced two kinds of foreign
laborers, those in industry and those in social welfare. The number
of foreign laborers in industry has been cut by more than 40,000
since the DPP came to power, he said.</P>
      <P>He said that the DPP's adjustment of its foreign laborer policy
is mainly based on the considerations of national dignity, protecting
job opportunities of nationals, basic human rights of foreign
laborers and cutting the total number of foreign laborers. The
purpose is to control the number of foreign laborers to below
300,000, he added.</P>
      <P>He said that his colleague, Ho, may have a "misunderstanding"
about foreign laborers, saying that for major construction projects
over NT$200 million (US$5.88 million) , the government sill bans the
import of foreign laborers, but he said that for those major
investment projects on strategic industries, it will allow the
introduction of foreign laborers based on several conditions.</P>
      <P>These include the investment amount, the number of jobs created,
the help to the development of peripheral industries and the aid
given to underprivileged groups.</P>
      <P>"Only those projects that meet these criteria will be able to
apply to introduce foreign laborers, and there will not be any
misgivings about benefiting specific groups," he said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the employment will follow a one-two ratio, meaning
that when two local workers are employed, then one foreign laborer
will be allowed to enter Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lai noted that the Formosa Plastics Group will invest NT$120
billion into its project, which he said will create 270,000 jobs,
including those for more than 5,000 foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>Lai said that this is a good thing, asking, "Do we want the
Formosa Plastics Group to remain in Taiwan or invest overseas?"</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHANCES SLIM FOR CROSS-STRATI CHARTER PLANE SERVICE FOR HOLIDAY: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chance that Taiwan and mainland China
will agree on indirect charter flights for mainland-based Taiwan
businessmen to return home for the Lunar New Year holiday is slim,
since negotiations have yet to start, a government official said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a regular news briefing, Chen Ming-tung, a vice
chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) , said
the cross-Taiwan Strait charter plane service might not be available
for the many Taiwan businessmen and their families who wish to return
home for the coming Chinese New Year holiday, since without bilateral
talks, it would be difficult for the plane to get off the ground.</P>
      <P>Clarifying a recent media report that attributed the inability of
the two sides to begin talks on the service to Taiwan's failure to
honor its promise to allow mainland-based airlines to participate in
the program in this, the second time the routes have been used, Chen
made it clear that the "MAC never made such a pledge."</P>
      <P>According to the report, the mainland side agreed last Chinese
New Year to allow Taiwan-based aviation companies to unilaterally fly
Taiwan businessmen back home from mainland China in exchange for
Taiwan's permission this time to allow mainland-based carriers to
join in. The report also said that mainland China favors the idea of
commissioning private groups to conduct relevant talks.</P>
      <P>The MAC vice chairman criticized the report as untrue and
insisted that the private sector cannot represent government
authorities to negotiate matters pertaining to law enforcement.</P>
      <P>Chen also accused the mainland side of lacking sincerity in
pushing for the charter flight service, since the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait has so far failed
to respond to the invitation issued by the MAC-affiliated Straits
Exchange Foundation to begin talks on the issue.</P>
      <P>If mainland China is sincere in cooperating with Taiwan to start
the service in the interest of Taiwan businessmen, it should do
something concrete to make it happen, such as following the
year-earlier mode of having stopovers in Hong Kong or Macau, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>The main stumbling block between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait lies in the fact that the Beijing regime is reluctant to face
the reality that the Republic of China exists, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Chen Chung-hsin, head of the mainland affairs department under
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , also criticized
mainland China for passing the responsibility to Taiwan by not
efficiently responding to Taiwan's initiatives to start talks.</P>
      <P>According to the DPP official, MAC Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen has
demonstrated her willingness to allow mainland Chinese airlines to
join in the charter flight plan as Beijing has requested. But the
mainland side has still failed to reply on a date to beginning talks,
he added.</P>
      <P>Beijing is simply trying to pass the buck to Taiwan by stalling
on the talks, he stressed.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is happy to see that both
sides of the Taiwan Strait think highly of Taiwan businessmen, but
hopes that mainland China will take substantive action to maintain
peace in the Taiwan Strait, Presidential Office Secretary-General
Chiou I-jen said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chiou was responding to mainland Chinese President Hu Jintao's
remarks the previous day when he received the presidents of Taiwan
businessmen's associations in mainland China and told them he will
make every effort to achieve the peaceful unification of China.</P>
      <P>"Our cross-strait policy remains steady," Chiou said, adding that
President Chen Shui-bian has said repeatedly that his advocacy of
"one country on each side of Taiwan Strait, " and "defensive
referendum" are not attempts to change the status quo and have
nothing to do with Taiwan independence, nor are they provocations.
They are intended to strengthen Taiwan's democracy and maintain peace
in the region, Chiou said, which is "our basic stance," although
mainland China might have a different interpretation.</P>
      <P>"We don't want to change the status quo," Chiou said.</P>
      <P>The government has released more than 20 substantive polices over
the past three years to improve cross-strait relations, averaging
almost one policy every two months, he went on, citing the direct
trade, postal and transportation links between the Republic of
China-controlled islands of Kinmen and Matsu and various mainland
ports, allowing mainland journalists to be stationed in Taiwan and
allowing mainland spouses of Taiwan nationals to obtain work permits.</P>
      <P>Chiou said that "we have displayed substantive efforts to improve
cross-strait relations" and "we hope that Hu, after his statement,
can really do something along the lines of the more-than 20 policies
we have implemented."</P>
      <P>"Both sides should work toward improving cross-strait relations,"
Chiou said, adding that "Taiwan's unilateral efforts cannot ensure
peace in the Taiwan Strait."</P>
      <P>He expressed hope that Beijing will take substantive action and
that recent reports about the mainland authorities rounding up Taiwan
spies and clamping down on tax-evading Taiwan businessmen, which has
caused uneasiness among Taiwan businessmen, are only rumors.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If mainland China refuses to remove the
missiles it has aimed at Taiwan, it has no right to speak of
cross-strait peace and reconciliation, Chen Chi-mai, secretary
general of the legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said Friday.</P>
      <P>The DPP legislative party whip was responding to an apparent
attempt the previous day by the mainland authorities to woo Taiwan
when mainland leaders received the presidents of Taiwan businessmen's
associations in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese President Hu Jintao said he would do his utmost
to seek the peaceful unification of China and put forward "three ifs"
in his first meeting with the leaders of the Taiwan businessmen's
associations. These were described as "if things are favorable toward
Taiwanese businessmen investing in the mainland, if things are
favorable toward cross-strait economic, technology and cultural
exchange and cooperation, and if things are favorable toward the
development of cross-strait relations and national unification,"
mainland China will do its utmost to promote them.</P>
      <P>Chen said that if the mainland authorities do not remove the
missiles aimed at Taiwan and renounce the threat of force against
Taiwan, it has no right to talk about cross-strait peace or
reconciliation.</P>
      <P>"Even if they talk about '100 ifs, ' the Taiwan people will not
believe them, " Chen said. "Only if they make substantive moves to
show concern and goodwill by removing the missiles will they be
qualified to talk about cross-strait issues," he added.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that Hu, together with Chen Yun-lin, director of the
Taiwan Affairs Office of State Council, and his deputies Li Bingcai
and Wang Zaixi are the highest-level mainland officials to have
received Taiwan businessmen.</P>
      <P>"This is obviously because of the March presidential election in
Taiwan and because they want to woo Taiwan businessmen to affect the
election," he observed.</P>
      <P>Chen Chung-hsin, director of the DPP's Department of China
Affairs, echoed his words and noted that there are two factions on
the mainland concerning policy toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said Hu's words might be aimed at improving cross-strait ties
in the short term, hoping to woo the Taiwan people so as to dampen
the sentiment of Taiwan independence</P>
      <P>But he also urged Beijing to be pragmatic, saying that President
Chen Shui-bian's cross-strait policy has always been to keep Taiwan's
status quo and peace in the Taiwan Strait. He added that the
president said in his New Year's message this year that both sides of
the Taiwan Strait should establish stable, peaceful exchanges.</P>
      <P>But the DPP official also said that because there is a lack of
basis for mutual trust, there are great hurdles in the way of
achieving the goal.</P>
      <P>The mainland says that the hurdle lies on the Taiwan side, but
the Taiwan side disagrees. He cited as an example the direct
cross-strait postal, trade and transportation links touted by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that the government has already issued an assessment
report on direct transportation links, but has so far failed to get
any response from the mainland.</P>
      <P>"That is because Beijing doesn't want the DPP to continue to
rule, so that it is unwilling to give a chance to both sides to
improve relations before the March 20 presidential election, " he
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WATCHING U.S. MAD COW CASE CLOSELY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is watching closely the developments
following the announcement of the first case of mad cow disease in
the United States that was confirmed by a British veterinary
laboratory Thursday, government sources said Friday.</P>
      <P>Council of Agriculture (COA) officials said they will make a
decision shortly on whether a long-term ban on U.S. beef and related
products will be implemented.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the confirmation of the case, discovered in the
state of Washington, the world organization for animal health, known
by the acronym OIE, is expected to make a decision shortly on whether
to declare the United States a mad cow disease-affected area, the COA
officials said.</P>
      <P>If the United States is declared a mad cow disease-affected area,
it will have to suspend exports of beef and related products for
seven years. Taiwan, consequently, is also expected to announce a ban
on imports of U.S. beef and related products for seven years, said
Chen Yu-hsin, a section chief of the COA Bureau of Animal and Plant
Health Inspection and Quarantine.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) announced Wednesday a temporary
suspension of imports of U.S. beef, cattle carcasses, organs, tissue
and derived products such as placenta extract, in response to the
first case of mad cow disease reported in the United States a day
earlier.</P>
      <P>The beef import suspension is not expected to affect beef
supplies in Taiwan very much, as Taiwan still can import beef and
related products from Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Paraguay, in
addition to domestic supplies, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan consumers can turn choose domestic beef, as
the product is safe and supplies are strictly controlled in terms of
safety inspections.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan has adopted stricter inspection measures on beef
products and cattle than the criteria mandated by the OIE. For
example, he said, the OIE rules that for mad cow disease checks, 50
head of cattle out of each 500,000 must be examined by vets to make
sure the herd is not infected.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's criteria are 20 times more strict than the OIE standard,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taiwan rancher are raising some 160,000 head of cattle
islandwide. Some 600 head of cattle have been randomly selected for
mad cow disease inspection annually since 2002. This year, 984 head
had been examined as of the end of November.</P>
      <P>According to COA tallies, Australia and New Zealand are Taiwan's
two largest sources of beef. Taiwan imported more than 35,000 tons of
beef and related products from Australia in 2002, 15,400 tons from
New Zealand and 13,900 tons from the United States. Canada was the
fourth-largest supplier, with 3,800 tons. Other beef sources include
Panama and Paraguay.</P>
      <P>Mad cow disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy,
eats holes in the brains of cattle. It first sprang up in Britain in
1986 and spread through countries in Europe, prompting massive
slaughter of herds and decimating the European beef industry.</P>
      <P>A form of mad cow disease can be contracted by humans through
eating infected beef or nerve tissue, and possibly through blood
transfusions. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- the human form of mad cow
disease -- has so far killed 143 people in Britain and 10 elsewhere.
No one in the United States has died from the disease. People who are
possibly at risk for the disease are banned from donating blood.</P>
      <P>Chen Lu-hung, director-general of the DOH Bureau of Food
Sanitation, said U.S. milk and milk products will not be included for
the time being.</P>

said would help boost friendship between the two countries. Lee
refrained from elaborating further on his talks with Mori.</P>
      <P>Sources close to Lee said the former president took advantage of
the lunch meeting to thank Mori for granting him a visa to visit
Japan in April 2001 to receive medical treatment. At that time, Mori
was still prime minister. As to whether Lee is likely to visit Japan
again for medical treatment, the sources said, the issue was not
discussed.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene Chien said
President Chen Shui-bian met with Mori at the Presidential Office a
day earlier for wide-ranging talks.</P>
      <P>As Mori is on a private visit, Chien said he was not in a
position to comment further on the visit.</P>
      <P>To the best of his understanding, Chien said, Chen and Mori are
"old friends." Chen once met with Mori during a trip to Japan before
he assumed the presidency, Chien noted.</P>
      <P>Diplomatic sources said Chen exchanged views with Mori on
measures to further boost Taiwan-Japanese ties as well as
Asia-Pacific regional affairs.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, reports from Japan said Mori had advised Chen to have
second thoughts on his plan to hold a "defensive referendum" on the
day of Taiwan's next presidential election to provide a venue for
local people to express their feelings about mainland China's
deployment of nearly 500 ballistic missiles pointed at Taiwan. The
U.S. government has expressed concern about the referendum plan as it
is afraid that the move may provoke Beijing.</P>
      <P>Mori is one of the few Japanese political heavyweights to have
visited Taiwan and Beijing has expressed "deep regret" and "strong
dissatisfaction" with Mori's visit. Japanese news media have given
prominent coverage to Mori's itinerary.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of Mori's current trip is to attend the funeral
of a friend of his father. He will also dine with a group of Taiwan
alumni of his alma mater, Waseda University, before wrapping up his
visit Saturday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tang Pi-o of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
said Mori ranks among the three most influential Japanese politicians
at the moment. In the face of Beijing's diplomatic embargo against
Taiwan, Tang said, Mori's visit is an encouragement to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We hope other Japanese political heavyweights can follow suit
and make frequent visits to Taiwan help boost bilateral exchanges and
cooperation," Tang said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The popular Retail Booking System (RBS)
called a news conference Friday in Taipei to express its hope of
attracting domestic economy and budget hotels to enter its worldwide
Internet service.</P>
      <P>The system hopes to include Taiwan's small hotels and youth
hostels as part of its international service on the Internet to
provide backpackers with greater access to more economic options for
online hotel booking, an RBS executive said.</P>
      <P>Currently, almost all five-star hotels in Taiwan are part of the
RBS, and the system now is hoping to seek small and medium-sized
hotels to offer foreign individual customers more short-term
accommodation on the Internet, the RBS official said.</P>
      <P>Lai Seh-jen, deputy director-general of the Tourism Bureau under
the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, said the RBS
offers an effective channel for Taiwan's economy hotels and youth
hostels to sharpen their international distribution, particularly
among the many young and individual backpackers who are the
prevailing force in the global tourism market.</P>
      <P>The RBS drive comes at a good time, as the government has set a
target of doubling the number of tourist arrivals to Taiwan by 2008.</P>
      <P>The multilingual RBS is widely used by 15,000 hotels in 112
countries around the world, including Taiwan, Japan, South Korea,
Thailand, Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney, Indonesia, the United States

    <HEADLINE>3,500 ILLEGAL MAINLAND CHINESE IMMIGRANTS DETAINED IN 2003</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will have detained 3,500 illegal
mainland Chinese immigrants by the end of this year, the head of the
Cabinet-level Coast Guard Administration (CGA) said Friday.</P>
      <P>CGA Minister Wang Chun made the remarks in the first meeting as
part of a project to crack down on illegal immigrant crime
syndicates. The meeting was presided over by Premier Yu Shyi-kun.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that the detention of illegal mainland immigrants
reached its highest figure of 6,130 in 1993. The number began to
decrease after 1995, but started to increase dramatically again in
2002.</P>
      <P>The number of illegal mainland immigrants in the first 10 months
of this year reached 3,055, Wang said, adding that more than 300 have
been arrested since October and predicting that the number will reach
3,500 by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>But he said that mainland China has also begun to crack down on
illegal immigrants, and has arrested 200 so far. With both sides
taking action, he estimated that the number of illegal mainland
immigrants detained could drop to below 2,000 next year.</P>
      <P>Wang also said that after the recent revision of the Statute
Governing the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the
Mainland Area, those who broker illegal immigrants to come to Taiwan
-- known as snakeheads -- will receive stiffer punishment.</P>
      <P>Human smuggling ringleaders will face prison terms of over five
years, and could also be fined up to NT$10 million (US$294,117). The
fishing vessels commonly used to smuggle illegal immigrants will also
be confiscated.</P>
      <P>Ring members will be turned over to prosecutors' offices. Other
measures will include raising the cash rewards for informers to
between NT$3,000 and NT$60,000.</P>
      <P>National Police Administration Director-General Chang Su-liang
said that the police will step up a crackdown on fronts for
prostitution such as KTVs and barber shops and that when illegal
immigrants are found to be working there, the water and power
supplies to such businesses will be cut and they might be ordered to
close.</P>
      <P>Chang also said that new detention centers will be built on the
outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu, as most illegal immigrants are
detained there so as to facilitate their repatriation.</P>
      <P>An inter-government agency project to crack down on illegal
mainland immigrants was established Nov. 1 and the project
organizers hope to arrest 1,000 and 1,200 people and bust between 15
and 25 cases of syndicate crime during a six-month period.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CAL RESPECTS JAPANESE COURT DECISION OVER COMPENSATION: SPOKESMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China Airlines (CAL) respects the ruling by
a Japanese court Thursday that CAL must pay 5.02 billion yen (US$46.6
million) in compensation to the families of 111 people who perished
in a 1994 plane crash, a CAL spokesman said Friday.</P>
      <P>Responding to the ruling made by a Nagoya court, the spokesman
said that CAL will see to it that the families of the victims --
including 100 Japanese passengers and 11 Taiwanese passengers --
receive due compensation in accordance with the requests made by a
committee formed by the victims' families.</P>
      <P>All such payments will be made by CAL's insurance company and
will not have any impact on CAL's finances, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The ruling by the Japanese court marks a new high in Japanese air
traffic history in terms of the amount of compensation awarded and
the number of plaintiffs.</P>
      <P>However, another suit filed by the same committee against Airbus
Co. for compensation for the same tragedy was rejected by a French
court.</P>
      <P>According to an investigation report released by the Japanese
Ministry of Transport in July 1996, the 1994 CAL Airbus crash was
caused mainly by pilot error and the fact that there were no warning
systems in the aircraft exclusively for abnormalities.</P>
      <P>The families of the victims who filed the suits had asked that
CAL and Air Bus Co. jointly pay 19 billion yen in compensation for
the deaths of the 111 people.</P>
      <P>CAL has settled compensation and related matters separately with
families of 153 other victims, who included Taiwanese nationals and
citizens of various other countries, over the past nine years, the
spokesman added.</P>
      <P>The CAL Air Bus 300-600R passenger jet was flying from Chiang
Kai-shek International Airport to the central Japanese city of Nagoya
the night of April 26, 1994, when it crashed at the Nagoya Airport,
killing 264 of the 271 people aboard.</P>

drinks his cup of forfeit. Thus, even in this case of competition, he
shows himself to be a gentleman."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ratio of undecided voters has risen
while the support ratings for presidential candidates from both
ruling and opposition camps declined, according to the results of an
opinion poll released Saturday.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey of 1,205 randomly chosen adult residents,
conducted by the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) from Dec. 22-25, found
that the team of President Chen shui-bian and Vice President Annette
Lu has a support rating of 24.9 percent, down 0.4 percent from the
level recorded in a similar poll conducted a week ago.</P>
      <P>The support rating of the opposition "pan-blue alliance" ticket
of KMT Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party Chairman James Soong
also declined 1.1 percent to 33.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 6.1 percent said they would not go to polls or would
cast spoiled votes if the presidential election were to take place
the following day; and 35.9 percent said they have not yet decided
for whom they would vote, up 4.2 percent from the week-earlier
survey.</P>
      <P>Huang Teh-fu, director of the "pan-blue alliance's" polling
center, attributed the increase in the undecided voters to a
combination of factors, including the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP's) attack on the KMT's allegedly ill-gotten party assets
and the controversy over President Chen's alleged disclosure of
information about mainland China's missile deployment that opposition
parties claimed had led to Beijing's arrest of scores of alleged
Taiwan spies.</P>

Su Ih-jen.</P>
      <P>Su also urged local people to avoid visiting hospitals or eating
wild animal meat while traveling in mainland China to reduce the risk
of infection.</P>
      <P>Once the mainland patient is confirmed to have come down with
SARS, Su said, quarantine and other precautionary measures
will be further reinforced.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's Ministry of Health confirmed Saturday that a man
in Guangzhou was being treated as a suspected SARS case.</P>
      <P>The communicable disease triggered a worldwide health crisis
after emerging in China's southern Guangdong province in November
last year, causing more than 700 deaths from some 8,000
infections.</P>
      <P>The World Health Organization declared the disease contained worldwide on
July 5.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, a military medical researcher was confirmed on Dec. 17
to have contract the deadly virus while at work, raising fears that an
outbreak might return.</P>
      <P>The case was later determined an isolated one, with the CDC announcing the
island cleared of SARS infections after the last two people who had contact
with the patient were removed from a watchlist at midnight Friday.
The military researcher will be discharged from the hospital next
week.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A 60-member Taiwan rescue team left for
Iran Saturday evening to join search and rescue operations in the
southeastern Iranian city of Bam which was hit by a deadly
earthquake a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene Chien presented a national
flag to Huang Po-tsun, a senior official from the National Fire
Administration under the Ministry of the Interior who is heading the
rescue team on the Iranian rescue mission.</P>
      <P>Chien said at the flag-presentation ceremony held at Chaing
Kai-shek International Airport that Taiwan received assistance
from many countries when it was rattled by a magnitude 7.3
earthquake in 1999.</P>
      <P>"Now is time for us to feed back what we have received in the
past. We hope our rescue team will contribute to post-quake search
and relief operations," Chien added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) announced
earlier in the day that Taiwan will donate US$100,000 in emergency
relief aid to help Iranian quake victims.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials said the ministry has joined forces with Taiwan's
overseas offices in the Middle East to arrange for the rescue team to
reach Bam, which is located about 1,000 kilometers southeast of the
Iranian capital of Tehran.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan rescue team is scheduled to arrive in Iran Sunday via
a flight through Bangkok and Dubai. Iranian authorities will send
staff to assist professional Taiwan rescuers in carrying out their
work, MOFA officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials said MOFA has offered condolences and regards to
the Iranian government and earthquake refugees on behalf of the ROC
government and people.</P>
      <P>According to MOFA officials, the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu
Chi Foundation -- Taiwan's largest charity -- has also organized an
emergency relief team to assist in post-disaster relief operations in
Iran. The Tzu Chi team is scheduled to leave for Tehran Sunday
evening.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has sent rescue experts and first-aid medical
professionals to join disaster relief operations in Indonesia and El
Salvador in the past few years.</P>
      <P>Iran's official news agency reported Saturday that the Iranian
government has decided to offer visa-free entry privileges to foreign
rescue specialists and other emergency relief workers for the time
being.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ROC Red Cross Society said it has sent messages to
Iran's Red Crescent Society and the Geneva-based International
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, offering to send
rescue and medical professionals as well as relief goods to help
Iranian earthquake victims. The Red Cross Society said it plans to
send 30 trained rescuers to Iran initially.</P>
      <P>Major local Buddhist groups said they are also planning
humanitarian aid programs to assist Iranian refugees.</P>
      <P>The Tzu Chi Foundation said it will take concrete actions after
receiving reports from its volunteers in Iran's neighboring
countries, such as Jordan and Turkey.</P>
      <P>The Dhram Drum Mountain Culture and Education Foundation said it
has set up a special task force to work out feasible relief programs.</P>
      <P>The Ling Jiou Mountain Buddhist Society said it has maintained
close contacts with major Islamic groups in Iran as they have been
jointly planning a seminar on Buddhist-Islam exchanges to be held in
Iran in 2004. "We'll announce concrete post-quake aid programs

      <P>The Taiwan Roots Medical Peace Corps said it has expressed its
concerns about Iranian refugees through an Iranian non-government

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CALLS FOR UNITY AGAINST BEIJING MEDDLING IN 2004 ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Chiayi,  Taiwan,  Dec.  27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said
Saturday the nation's upcoming presidential election will be a battle
between Taiwan voters and the Communist Party of China (CPC) on the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Addressing a rally marking the inauguration of a campaign office
for the "Chen-Lu" ticket in the southern county of Chiayi, Chen said
the CPC's Taiwan Affairs Panel and its Central Military Commission
held a joint meeting Dec. 2 to discuss various measures aimed at
undermining his re-election bid.</P>
      <P>"Beijing authorities have decided to launch an all-out campaign
through news media, the Internet and Taiwanese businessmen operating
in mainland China to prevent me from winning the presidency again, "
Chen told a large crowd of his supporters present at the rally.</P>
      <P>Chen, who will team up with Vice President Annette Lu to run in
next presidential election scheduled for March 20, 2004, said the
upcoming election will not be a battle for him and the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) to remain in power, but rather a battle
against mainland China's interference with Taiwan's electoral
affairs.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan has come a long way to achieve democracy,
Chen said local people should stand united to fight against Beijing's
meddling in the upcoming presidential election.</P>
      <P>"We should not be daunted by China's intimidation and
saber-rattling, " Chen said, adding that the people of Taiwan should
be free of fear.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan is like an international outcast because
of mainland China's diplomatic embargo. "Worse still, it has deployed
hundreds of ballistic missiles pointed at Taiwan. And now it has
stepped up efforts to sway local voters ahead of our presidential
election. We should stand firm and united to stave off
Beijing's interference in our electoral affairs," he urged.</P>
      <P>Speaking at another supporters rally in neighboring Yunlin County
in the afternoon, Chen said the upcomign election is for the people
of Taiwan to choose their future national leader.</P>
      <P>"China has no say in deciding who should be Taiwan's president,"
Chen said. "Let our people use ballots to protect our young democracy
amd decide our own destiny."</P>
      <P> Chen also urged local voters to support his re-election to
complete his ambitious reform initiatives.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PENGHU RESIDENTS SUPPORT SETTING UP CASINOS DESPITE LOW TURNOUT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The turnout rate for a consultative
referendum on setting up casinos on the outlying Penghu Island was
only around 21 percent, but those who are supportive of setting up
casinos outnumbered those who are opposed to the idea.</P>
      <P>There are 68,086 eligible voters in Penghu, and out of the 13,814
effective votes cast, 7,830 votes were supportive of the
establishment of casinos, outnumbering the 5,984 votes who were
against the proposal.</P>
      <P>The outlying island, because of its geographical location and
windy weather conditions, has difficulty in developing a local
industry, and the job market is limited. As it is distant from Taiwan
proper, it has not attracted much attention from the central
government, resulting in stalled local construction and the outflow
of the local population.</P>
      <P>For this reason, Penghu has for the last 20 years tried to set up
casinos to help local development, but those who are opposed to the
idea said casinos could make social order worse and corrupt local
residents.</P>
      <P>The referendum promotion committee said that judging from the
referendum result, those who are in the more remote villages cast
more supportive votes, while those in Makung, the capital city, votes
between the yes and noes were 282 votes apart, showing those who are
civil servants, teachers or have higher educational backgrounds tend
to worry more about the possible adverse impacts of the casinos.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, independent Legislator Lin Ping-kun expressed the hope
that the government would attach importance to the result of the
referendum.</P>
      <P>As for the low turnout rate, Lin said that this was because the
choices of the referendum were too simplified with only two options.</P>
      <P>Lin stressed that Penghu residents have misgivings about whether
the government can effectively manage the casinos, and that if the
referendum had a third option -- meaning a conditional approval of
the setting up of casinos -- he is sure that a majority of the
residents would give their support.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Officials of the Environmental Protection
Bureau under Taipei City Government said Saturday that they are
satisfied with the results of the new kitchen leftover recycling
program one day after the system was put into practice.</P>
      <P>Environmental officials said that around 80 tons of kitchen waste
was collected Friday, or about half of their targeted collection goal
of 150 tons daily, which they said was a "good start."</P>
      <P>The officials said that they observed a great majority of people
supporting the kitchen leftover recycling effort, and they know how
to divide two different kinds of kitchen waste, although around 50
percent of the people still used plastic bags for kitchen waste.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Bureau provides containers to
collect kitchen waste, and the public can also use their own
containers to collect it.</P>
      <P>The officials urged the public to heed the regulations and not
mix non-kitchen waste with kitchen waste, saying that those who
violate the regulations will be advised for the time being, and will
later be fined between NT$1,200 and NT$6,000 (US$35.29 to US$176.45).</P>
      <P>The kitchen waste is divided into two categories under the new
system: food leftovers or spoiled food will be used to feed pigs,
while fruit peelings, egg shells, fruit seeds, tea and coffee grounds
are to be used as compost.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Administration also
announced that the kitchen waste collection system will be expanded
from Taipei to all cities and counties in Taiwan next year, hoping to
recycle 900 tons of kitchen waste a day.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will donate US$100,000 in emergency

    <TEXT>
      <P>The scientist who came down with severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is expected to be released from
Taipei Municipal Hoping Hospital by the end of this month, a hospital
official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Huang Lien-chi, deputy superintendent of the hospital, said that
Lt. Col. Chan, a SARS researcher with the Institute of Preventive
Medicine under the National Defense Medical College, who contracted
the atypical pneumonia while handling the virus, is recuperating well
at the hospital.</P>
      <P>"Except for a very small amount of virus in his body, Lt. Col.
Chan is just like a normal, healthy person," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Huang said the hospital has sent a specimen of Chan's saliva to
the Center for Disease Control under the Department of Health, and
if all examinations are negative, then he can be discharged from the
hospital.</P>
      <P>Chan checked into Hoping Hospital Dec. 17, and his fever subsided
the next day and his conditions greatly improved. He has not needed a
nose tube over the past two days, and his breathing is smooth without
signs of shortness of breath.</P>
      <P>The more significant development is that antibodies have appeared
in his system, showing that the amount of viral infection is slowly
being reduced, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Chan, the first SARS case this winter, is believed to have
contracted the disease at work Dec. 5 when he touched spilled SARS
samples with his bare hands after work that was part of SARS virus
research at a top-level P4 laboratory in which the use of gowns and
gloves is mandatory. It was not clear why Chan had decided to break
the rules and not wear gloves.</P>
      <P>He then flew to Singapore for an academic conference along with
five co-workers Dec. 7 and began to feel fatigue the next day while
in Singapore, but did not develop the fever which is typical of SARS.</P>
      <P>Chan returned to Taiwan Dec. 10, and by that night, had developed
a fever of 38.5 degrees Celsius. His wife took him to see a doctor
near their house in Hsintien the next day. At that time, nobody
suspected him of having SARS, even though his job involved working
with the SARS virus. Another full week passed before he was sent to
Hoping hospital after developing diarrhea. At the hospital, Chan
underwent tests that confirmed the SARS virus was present in his
system.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said
Saturday that a series of agricultural reform projects have reflected
President Chen Shui-bian's determination in protecting farmers'
interests.</P>
      <P>In an inspection tour to cooperative societies in Yunlin County
to better understand their marketing operations, Yu noted that the
Council of Agriculture and the China External Trade Development
Council have been cooperating actively in promoting the sales of
Taiwan's agricultural products abroad.</P>
      <P>He went on that the country needs a comprehensive plan for the
production and marketing of agricultural products.</P>
      <P>According to Yu, other measures aimed at protecting farmers
interests are also high on the agenda of the government, such as
increasing elderly farmers' pensions, offering low-interest farmers'
loans and disaster relief loans, as well as increasing import relief
funds.</P>
      <P>Yu added that the government plans to inject NT$67.5 billion
(US$1.98 billion) into the import relief fund next year to better
protect the interests of farmers, and the target for the fund in 2005
will be NT$100 billion.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, in a visit to an association of president
Chen's supporters, Yu stressed that the DPP government has presented
numerous policies and reform plans since it came to power in 2000.</P>
      <P>As a result, the island's economy has been recovering, and share
prices, the real estate market, as well as foreign reserves are
rising, Yu noted and added that the DPP government has the capability
to lead the country efficiently. Therefore, he said that it would be
unwise to remove the architects of the vibrant, new country.</P>
      <P>Yu urged the people to continue their support for Chen in next
year's presidential election for the welfare of the country.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yu criticized the opposition Kuomintang's reluctance

    <HEADLINE>BEEF IMPORTERS URGED TO DISPLAY COUNTRY OF ORIGIN CERTIFICATES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Relevant government agencies should demand
that beef importers produce official country of origin certificates
because of concern over mad cow disease, the ROC Consumers Foundation
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Beef retailers or supermarket operators should also be required
to display country of origin certificates on their beef shelves, the
non-profit foundation said.</P>
      <P>The foundation made the call after conducting spot checks on
supermarket shelves in 10 noted department stores in metropolitan
Taipei Dec. 25-26 amid concern about beef safety in the wake of the
announcement of the first case of mad cow disease in the United
States.</P>
      <P>The foundation said only Tayeh Takashimaya Department Store has
clearly displayed country of origin certificates where it sells beef
products.</P>
      <P>The remaining stores have either not displayed the origin
certificates or have offered confusing information, the foundation
said. For instance, a supermarket displayed a "beef imported from
Australia" signboard near a shelf even though the labels on the
packages indicated that the products were from the United States.</P>
      <P>Nearly all supermarkets surveyed displayed posters claiming that
their beef came from Australia or New Zealand, but none of them have
produced country of origin certificates or copies of the documents,
the foundation said.</P>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH) officials said they will intensify
their spot checks of markets. Supermarket operators or retailers who
offer confusing or false information to mislead consumers will be
penalized in accordance with existing food regulations, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>The Consumers Foundation advised consumers to ascertain product
origin and check relevant certificates whenever they purchase beef at
supermarkets or other retail shops. Amid the mad cow disease scare,
the foundation said consumers should for the time being avoid eating
beef offal.</P>
      <P>The foundation also urged food hygiene authorities to step up
inspections of markets and trace distribution networks. While beef
importers should be required to produce country of origin
certificates, the foundation said, retailers should display those
certificates at distribution points.</P>
      <P>Health authorities should also inspect dairy products and
cosmetics to determine whether they contain contaminated substances,
the foundation said, adding that the government should establish an
imported meat certification system.</P>
      <P>More important, the foundation said, the government should make
every possible effort to prevent beef smuggling, particularly cattle
offal from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Council of Agriculture (COA) said it is closely
watching the developments following the announcement of the first
U.S. mad cow disease case.</P>
      <P>As of Saturday, the COA said, the world organization for animal
health, known by the acronym OIE, has not yet declared the United
States a mad cow disease-affected area.</P>
      <P>If the United States is declared a mad cow disease-affected area,
it will have to suspend exports of beef and related products for
seven years.</P>
      <P>Like many other countries, Taiwan announced a temporary ban on
beef imports from the United States immediately after the
announcement of the discovery of a mad cow disease-infected cow on a
farm in Washington State Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to OIE regulations, the COA said, member countries can
determine the scope and duration of the import ban in terms of the
contamination risks of different products after a specific country is
declared a mad cow disease-infected area.</P>
      <P>"This means in case the United States is declared a mad cow
disease-affected area, Taiwan may still import selected beef products
under certain conditions, " said Chiang Yi-nan, director of the COA's
Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine.</P>
      <P>The United States is Taiwan's third-largest beef supplier, after
Australia and New Zealand. In 2002, Taiwan imported more than 35,000
tons of beef and related products from Australia, 15,400 tons from
New Zealand and 13,900 tons from the United States.</P>
      <P>Mad cow disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy,
eats holes in the brains of cattle. It first sprang up in Britain in
1986 and spread through countries in Europe, prompting the massive
slaughter of herds and decimating the European beef industry.</P>
      <P>A form of mad cow disease can be contracted by humans by eating
infected beef or nerve tissue, and possibly through blood
transfusions. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- the human form of mad cow
disease -- has so far killed 143 people in Britain and 10 elsewhere.
No one in the United States has died from the disease. People who are
possibly at risk from the disease are banned from donating blood.</P>

spouses of the many Taiwan businessmen operating on the mainland
should ask their husbands to return home if the Chinese Communist
regime refuses to abandon the option of the use of force against
Taiwan.</P>

aimed at a small group of Taiwan independence advocates.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TEMPERATURE CHECKS AT AIRPORTS COULD BECOME NORM: HEALTH OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Temperature checks may become the norm at
Taiwan's international airports in the wake of a possible resurgence
of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Guangdong Province,
mainland China, a Center for Disease Control (CDC) official said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>While closely monitoring the situation regarding the suspected
SARS case in Guangdong, Taiwan authorities implemented the
temperature taking policy at the country's two international airports
Saturday as part of efforts to keep SARS at bay, CDC Deputy
Director-General Shih Wen-yi said at a joint press conference.</P>
      <P>Chiang Kai-shek International Airport and Kaohsiung International
Airport began on Saturday taking the temperature of passengers
arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau after a suspected
SARS case was reported in Panyu City, Guangdong.</P>
      <P>Passengers found to have a fever -- an early symptom of SARS --
will be sent directly to hospital upon arrival, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the press conference that he jointly called with
Chang Shang-chun, director of the Infectious Disease Department at
National Taiwan University Hospital, and Ho Mei-shang, an associate
research fellow at Academia Sinica's Institute of Biomedical
Sciences, Shih said the CDC is worried that SARS may already have
become an endemic disease in some areas in Asia which will occur
seasonally in these regions.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the possible SARS case in Guangdong, Chang said
that "one can never be too careful, " adding that employing a higher
standard of preventive measures is essential for Taiwan at a time
when the Guangdong health authorities are delaying in verifying the
latest case.</P>
      <P>For her part, Ho, a virologist, said some SARS cases take longer
to verify due to the nature of the disease.</P>
      <P>Shih said he believes that Guangdong's latest suspected SARS case
will not be an isolated case. In June of this year, mainland China
was declared safe for travel after a spate of SARS outbreaks in
southern and northern parts of the country.</P>
      <P>He said that if Guangdong's suspected SARS case is confirmed to
indeed be a SARS case and the patient is found not to have come into
close contact with any wild animals recently, this will indicate that
SARS has become endemic in the region.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Shih said that the temperature taking policy
implemented at Taiwan's international airports Saturday is not only
helping in the battle against SARS, pointing out that several cases
of malaria, dengue fever and shigella dysentery have also been
discovered.</P>
      <P>In addition to the temperature checks at the airports, other
measures, such as vaccination against SARS as well as the development
of relevant medicines, are crucial for Taiwan in its fight against
SARS, he said.</P>
      <P>The CDC urged local people to avoid visiting hospitals or eating
wild animal meat while traveling in mainland China in order to reduce
the risk of contracting SARS.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN LABORERS DEMONSTRATE FOR BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 600 foreign workers in Taiwan took to
the streets Sunday to appeal to the government to protect their basic
human rights in a demonstration which began from the 228 Memorial
Park in downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>The foreign workers, expatriates from Indonesia, the Philippines,
Thailand and Vietnam, came from their work places in Taipei, Chungli,
Taoyuan and southern Taiwan to take part in the demonstration, a
spokesperson for the Taiwan International Workers Association (TIWA)
said.</P>
      <P>During the rally, the foreign workers made known their four-point
appeal to the government, asking the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA)
to carry out a comprehensive review of the foreign worker
introduction policy aimed at protecting the foreign expatriates'
rights to choose and change employers.</P>
      <P>The TIWA wants the CLA to establish a "foreign worker affairs
bureau" under the CLA hierarchy to directly handle labor affairs
between the government of Taiwan and those of the expatriates'
countries so as to prevent exploitation by labor brokers, the
spokesperson said.</P>
      <P>The TIWA also wants the Legislative Yuan to enact a statute
governing household services and related affairs so as to protect the
foreign workers' rights to rest and free time. It further wants the
CLA to repeal the existing regulation in which meal and accommodation
costs are calculated as part of the foreign workers' wages, the
spokesperson said.</P>
      <P>The spokesperson pointed out that some 3 million foreign workers
have been sacrificing their time and energy working as laborers in
Taiwan over the past decade, contributing significantly to Taiwan's
development in various sectors.</P>
      <P>The foreign workers should not be blamed for Taiwan's rising
unemployment, the spokesperson said. Instead, the Taiwan authorities
should review and overhaul their labor affairs policy to find out
what has gone wrong and what has caused the foreign workers' plight
and rising unemployment, the spokesperson added.</P>
      <P>The rally, the first of its kind in Taiwan's history, kicked off
from the 228 Memorial Park at 2 p.m., with the foreign workers
walking with banners along Guanqian Road, Zhongxiao East Road,
Gongyuan Road, Qingdao West Road and Zhongshan South Road to
Ketagalan Road in front of the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>In related news, lawmakers from the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) said last Friday that the DPP has reduced the number of
foreign laborers in Taiwan to 297,000 -- down 32,000 from the peak
figure -- over the past three years.</P>
      <P>The legislators made the remarks in response to remarks by
Legislator Ho Tsai-feng of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
criticizing the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) for relaxing the
foreign laborer policy at the expense of domestic workers.</P>
      <P>Ho said that the CLA announced recently that it will once again
allow imports of foreign laborers in the construction sector after
having suspended them for two years. Formosa Plastics Group's sixth
naphtha cracker project will be able to introduce 5,800 foreign
laborers, which Ho said will affect the employment opportunities of
domestic laborers. Ho noted that the jobless rate in November was 4.7
percent.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lai Chin-teh retorted that the number of foreign
laborers in the industrial sector has been cut by more than 40,000
since the DPP came to power.</P>
      <P>Lai said that the DPP's adjustment of its foreign laborer policy
is mainly based on considerations of national dignity, the protection
of job opportunities for Taiwan citizens, the basic human rights of
foreign laborers, and the goal of reducing the total number of
foreign laborers in Taiwan. The purpose is to control the number of
foreign laborers at below 300,000, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TOURISM MIGHT BE AFFECTED BY NEW SARS CASES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 28 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's tourism industry might be dealt a
fresh blow by the recent re-emergence of severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) in Taiwan and mainland China, a business source said
on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Tseng Chien-shun, secretary-general of the Taiwan Tourism
Association, said both inbound and outbound travel will be affected
by the new SARS cases in Taiwan and mainland China as many cautious
Japanese and Taiwanese tourists will decide to stay away from Taiwan
and the mainland, respectively, out of a fear of a possible new SARS
outbreak.</P>
      <P>Tseng based his argument on the fact that a large number of
Japanese tourists immediately canceled their trips to Taiwan in the
wake of the outbreaks of the potentially deadly epidemic in spring
this year. The last time they did so was in 1999, when the Sept. 21
earthquake -- the worst in Taiwan's history -- rocked the island, he
noted.</P>
      <P>Despite an intensified government effort to attract foreign
tourists with the goal of doubling the number of tourists to Taiwan
by 2008, a drop in the number of Japanese tourists will undoubtedly
have a negative impact on the domestic tourism industry since Japan
has long been a leading source of tourists to the island.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications plans to send officials to Japan, Singapore, Hong
Kong, Malaysia, the United States and Europe from the beginning of
next year to promote Taiwan as a tourist destination, with the goal
of attracting 3.2 million tourist arrivals for the whole of 2004.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the island's outbound travel to mainland China,
the most popular overseas destination among Taiwan tourists, will
also be affected by the new suspected SARS case in the southern
mainland province of Guangdong, said business sources from
Taiwan-based tourist agencies.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, the number of mainland-bound Taiwan
tourists has steadily increased by an annual rate of more than 10
percent over the past decade. However, the SARS outbreaks earlier
this year in mainland China had an unprecedented negative impact on
Taiwan's tourist industry, they added.</P>
      <P>With the new suspected SARS case in Guangdong, many Taiwan
travelers will cancel or put off their trips to the mainland until
the situation is adequately dealt with, the sources predicted,
expressing worry that Taiwan travel agencies may face tougher times
ahead.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CONSIDERING INITIATING REFERENDUM ON EDUCATION, HEALTH INSURANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  28 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT) is mulling over
putting the controversial education reform and national health
insurance premiums increase to a referendum now that the referendum
bill has gone through the legislative process and is set to be
promulgated into law by the president next week.</P>
      <P>Lee Chia-chin, KMT whip at the Legislature, told CNA that the
president is supposed to promulgate the bill ten days after being
informed by the Legislative Yuan of its decision to reject a request
by the Executive Yuan to reconsider the bill. The bill is supposed to
take effect three days after being promulgated.</P>
      <P>As the bill empowers the Legislature to initiate referendums on
policies laid down by the Executive Yuan, the KMT is considering
putting to a referendum the government's education reform which
features the abolishment of the joint university entrance examination
and its replacement with an admissions system patterned on the U.S.
university system.</P>
      <P>The changes have prompted complaints from teachers and parents of
students, especially those whose children are applying for admission
to universities under the new system. They have criticized the new
system as expensive, troublesome, and giving universities the power
to arbitrarily turn down applicants.</P>
      <P>The KMT is also contemplating putting to a referendum the
increase in national health insurance premiums and the amount paid by
patients per visit to doctor.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien Chan, the opposition "pan-blue alliance"
candidate for the presidential election set for Mar. 20, 2004, has
promised during the campaign to modify the education reform by
reinstating the joint university entrance examination and
re-introducing uniform text books.</P>
      <P>The increase in national health insurance premiums and
doctor-visit fees was implemented by Chen Shui-bian's administration
Sept. 1, 2000, without first consulting the Legislature. Lee
Min-liang, the health minister at the time, claimed his office was
empowered to do so at its own discretion.</P>
      <P>The angry opposition lawmakers asked the Control Yuan -- the
executive branch's top watchdog -- to intervene, which it did on July
2 by ordering the Executive Yuan to seek the Legislative Yuan's
approval within two months. However, the Control Yuan later agreed to
the Executive Yuan's request in September to extend the two-month
deadline indefinitely.</P>
      <P>Lee Chia-chin said the KMT is assessing the public response to
the two proposals before deciding whether to flex the Legislature's
muscle by calling for a referendum on the two issues. He added that
hopefully, the referendum will be held simultaneously with the

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT HONORS MODELS OF FILIAL PIETY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 28 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian recalled his own
father while honoring seven models of "dutiful sons" in a ceremony
held in Tainan County, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president said that his father helped his wife Wu Shu-chen
run for a legislative seat in 1985 when he himself was at the nadir
of his political career. At the time, Chen had just been defeated in
the Tainan County magistrate election and had been sentenced to jail
for eight months for libel, and his wife Wu Shu-chen was paralyzed
from the waist down in a traffic accident.</P>
      <P>Wu succeeded in the election, but Chen's father was diagnosed
with terminal liver cancer and died four months after the election.
Chen said his father didn't live long enough to see his son elected
president.</P>
      <P>The president lauded the establishment of the prize to honor the
models of filial piety, saying that filial piety can improve harmony
in society. He pointed out that the founder of the prize, business
tycoon Wu Hsiou-chi, is himself a well-known dutiful son.</P>
      <P>The 91-year-old Wu attended the ceremony in a wheelchair despite
not feeling well. The president expressed his respect to Wu and
wished him to get well soon.</P>
      <P>After the ceremony, the president attended a trade fair for
agricultural products, in Tainan City.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the trade fair organized by the China External Trade
Development Council (CETRA) , Chen touted his administration's
contribution to helping the country's farmers through such measures
as lowering the interest rate for loans to farmers, raising the price
of purchasing rice from farmers and increasing monthly allowances to
senior farmers to NT$4,000 (US$117).</P>
      <P>Chen also claimed credit for Sunday's trade fair, saying that he
ordered the CETRA to promote sales of Taiwan's agricultural products
overseas in addition to exploring markets for the country's
information products to cushion the impact brought about by the
country's entry into the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>The president tasted the fruits displayed at the fair and drew
lots to select the winner of a television set prize offered by the
organizer to visitors.</P>
      <P>CETRA Chairman Hsu Chih-ren said this is the ninth trade fair of
its kind organized and held this year in Taiwan by the council.</P>
      <P>Employing the method used to promote sales of Taiwan's computers,
CETRA has succeeded in helping Taiwan's agricultural products sell in
Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore, Hsu said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A 19-member group from the Buddhist
Compassionate Relief Foundation of Tzu Chi, Taiwan's largest charity
organization, arrived in Tehran, Iran at around 2 a.m. Monday to aid
in relief work for Iranian earthquake victims.</P>
      <P>The southeastern Iranian city of Bam was hit by a deadly
earthquake in the early morning of last Friday. The death toll stood
at about 25,000 as of Monday, and Iranian officials have said that it
could eventually rise to as high as 30,000. Bam is located about
1,000 kilometers southeast of the Iranian capital Tehran.</P>
      <P>The members of the Tzu Chi relief group, who came from Taiwan,
Jordan and Turkey, separately, are preparing to depart for Bam Monday
morning, bringing the foundation's first batch of relief supplies,
including 100 medical supply kits, 11,000 blankets, as well as food
supplies and bottled water, to those injured or made homeless by the
earthquake.</P>
      <P>As temperatures in Bam have dropped to as low as minus 6 degrees
Celsius in recent nights, the Tzu Chi group is taking tents and
sleeping bags for themselves in order to be able to remain in the
disaster area for a longer period of time.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a 60-member Taiwan rescue team left for Iran Saturday
evening to join search and rescue operations in the ancient Iranian
city of Bam.</P>
      <P>The team, comprised of professional rescue workers from the
National Fire Administration and Taipei City Government, has had
experience in search and rescue work in post-disaster areas in
Indonesia and El Salvador.</P>
      <P>A relief group from World Vision Taiwan is scheduled to arrive in
Tehran Tuesday morning, bringing its first batch of relief supplies,
including blankets, bottled water and medicine. The relief supplies
total about US$25,000 in value, according to a spokesman for the
charity organization.</P>
      <P>The ROC Red Cross Society said Saturday that it has sent messages
to Iran's Red Crescent Society and the Geneva-based International
Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, offering to
send rescue and medical professionals as well as relief supplies to
help the Iranian earthquake victims. The Red Cross Society said it
will initially send 30 trained rescue workers to Iran.</P>
      <P>The ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs also announced Saturday that
the government will donate US$100,000 in emergency relief aid to help
the Iranian quake victims.</P>
      <P>Another Taiwan religious and philanthropic group, the Dhram Drum
Mountain Social Welfare and Charity Foundation, announced on Sunday a
donation of US$100,000 to help the quake victims and at the same time
launched a fund raising campaign for the same cause.</P>
      <P>Foundation founder, Master Sheng Yen, who visited the Middle East
earlier this month to spread the message of peace, said that his
group will remit the donated money as soon as possible to
international relief organizations for the purchase of needed
materials for the quake victims.</P>
      <P>The Ling Jiou Mountain Buddhist Society said Saturday that it has
maintained close contact with major Islamic groups in Iran as they
have been jointly planning a seminar on Buddhist-Islam exchanges to
be held in Iran in 2004. "We'll announce concrete post-quake aid
programs after discussing the matter with Iranian Islamic groups, " a
spokesman for the organization said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Roots Medical Peace Corps said it has expressed its
concerns about the Iranian disaster victims through an Iranian
non-government organization known as the ODBVV. "We'll evaluate the
feasibility of offering medical aid after receiving a report from the
ODBVV about the medical needs in the quake-affected region, " the
group's founder Liu Chi-chun said in a telephone interview.</P>
