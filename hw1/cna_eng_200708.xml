    <TEXT>
      <P>Even if the ruling party abandons its plans for a referendum calling for U.N.
membership for Taiwan, the leader of Taiwan's main opposition Kuomingtan (KMT)
has said that it would stick to its own proposal for having such a vote.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung was quoted as saying in a closed-door party meeting
Tuesday that the KMT would push ahead no matter how much pressure might be
coming from the United States or China.</P>
      <P>A source who attended the meeting said that Wu made the remarks after other
senior party officials expressed support for continuing their work toward having
a referendum, likely to coincide with the presidential election scheduled for
next March.</P>
      <P>Wu's remarks came a day after the KMT, as required by the Referendum Law,
submitted more than 126,000 sigatures along with its proposal for a referendum
to the Central Election Commission.</P>
      <P>The panel is expected to refer the case in mid-August to an Executive Yuan
committee, which will then make a decision on the merit of having the vote.</P>
      <P>Intended as a countermeasure to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's plan,
the KMT proposal involves holding a referendum on Taiwan's U.N. bid "under all
possible designations", including the Republic of China or Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Court to hand down ruling Aug. 14 on ex-mayor's corruption case</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Taipei District Court will hand down a ruling Aug. 14 on an embezzlement
case involving former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, the presiding judge dealing
with the case announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The trial judge made the announcement at the end of oral argument between the
prosecution and the defendant at 11 p.m. He said the two parties can furnish the
court with additional documents or files by Aug. 3.</P>
      <P>Responding to the judge's question at the end of the last court hearing on the
case whether he still maintains his innocence, Ma said: "Yes, I proclaim my
innocence."</P>
      <P>Ma, who is now the main opposition Kuomintang's candidate for the 2008
presidential election, was indicted Feb. 13 on charges of corruption.</P>
      <P>The prosecutor said in the indictment that Ma abused his position to embezzle
NT$11.17 million from a "special affairs fund" reserved for his discretionary
use during his mayoral term from 1998 to 2006. The offense is subject to a
minimum seven-year prison term.</P>
      <P>During Tuesday's  court hearing,  the prosecution  employed additional legal
provisions against Ma, claiming that Ma's action also involved offenses of
breach of trust prescribed in Article 342 and Article 134 of Criminal Code.</P>
      <P>Article 134 states that a public official who takes advantage of his authority,
opportunity or means afforded by his position to commit intentionally an offense
not provided for in this chapter shall be subject to harsher punishment than
that prescribed for such offense, with the prison term increased up to one half.</P>
      <P>The maximum punishment for an offense of breach of trust is five years of
imprisonment. Now that the prosecution demands a one-half increase of the
punishment, the prison term could exceed seven years.</P>
      <P>In the Ma's embezzlement case, Yu Wen, a Taipei city government secretary, was
also indicted on charges of corruption and forgery. Several individuals who
worked at the city government during Ma's tenure were given suspended charges.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the last trial session, Ma argued that he didn't tell Hou Kuan-jen,
the prosecutor responsible for investigating the case, during the first round of
questioning that the "special affairs fund" was "public money" purely reserved
for official functions.</P>
      <P>Ma said the prosecutor took his statement out of context by claiming in the
indictment that he admitted in the first round of prosecutorial questioning that
the "special affairs fund" was "public money" that should be used for official
purposes only.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, what he said during the questioning was that the "special
affairs fund" was not "public money." "The prosecutor took my deposition out of
context," he said at the court.</P>
      <P>Responding to Ma's statement, Hou said he was not surprised by Ma's claim, but
he insisted that his record of Ma's deposition fully complied  with Ma's true
meaning and contained  no twists or discrepancies.</P>
      <P>"I clearly remembered that Ma spent more than an hour reading my record during
the first round of questioning. He also requested correction of many sentences.
He signed his name on my record only after the record was corrected and re-
printed in line with his requests," Hou said, adding that his record truthfully
reflected Ma's meaning.</P>
      <P>Hou said Ma is welcome to apply for inspection of the original text of his
record or audio and visual recordings of the first round of the questioning.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese couple with dangerous forms of tuberculosis (TB) who flew to China
despite a travel ban have already returned to Taiwan on a helicopter arranged by
the Department of Health (DOH), a DOH official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chou Chih-hao, deputy director of the DOH Center for Disease Control (CDC), said
the husnad, identified only by his family name of Lee, has multidrug-resistant
tuberculosis (MDR-TB), and his wife, who has active TB, were sent to the DOH run
Taichung Hospital in central Taiwan for treatment in aquarantine ward
immediately after they arrived back in the country.</P>
      <P>The Lees were escorted to Kinmen Island from the coastal Chinese city of Xiamen
on a direct ferry Monday night. The DOH arranged for a helicopter to carry them
to the Taichung Airport Thuesday evening, Chou said.</P>
      <P>Lee's daughter-in-law was also diagnosed with MDR-TB and is undergoing medical
treatment in an isolation ward, while Lee's father, who has been diagnosed with
tuberculosis, has been discharged from the hospital after received treatment.</P>
      <P>Lee's mother and eldest son do not have TB, Chou said.</P>
      <P>The cost of the Lees' violation of the travel ban includes NT$40,000 (US$1,215)
in travel fees for an epidemic control physician who had to travel to China to
arrange for the Lees' return, NT$80,000 for renting a ferry and NT$200,000 for
chartering the helicopter, Chou said, adding that additional expenditure in
China had not yet been calculated.</P>
      <P>Chou reminded the public to be aware of tuberculosis as it has a long latency
period. Patients with tuberculosis should take medicine regularly and people who
need to take care of family members with tuberculosis must wear masks in order
to lower the infection risk, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung District Court acquitted Tuesday three defendants accused of
corruption and breach of trust for not following government procurement
procedures in conducting six public bids for the Kaohsiung mass rapid transit
(MRT) project in 2002.</P>
      <P>The three are former members of a five-member committee in charge of the
Kaohsiung MRT project. They are former Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp (KRTC) Vice
Chairman Chen Min-hsien, former KRTC General Manager Lai Hsien-yu, and former
Kaohsiung Bureau of Rapid Transit Systems Director Chou Li-liang.</P>
      <P>The court handed down a not guilty verdict, saying that the government
procurement law is not applicable to the six bids for public construction
projects.</P>
      <P>The court ruled that there was no evidence the trio affected fair competition
among the bidders and that neither was there any evidence they had disclosed the
minimum bid price to benefit particular construction companies.</P>
      <P>The court found the other two former members of the committee guilty of taking
bribes.</P>
      <P>Chung Shan-tun, former secretary-general of the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications, received a sentence of four years in prison and will be stripped
of his civil rights for two years after the end of his sentence. The NT$3
million he took in bribes will be confiscated.</P>
      <P>Former Kaohsiung City Bureau of Urban Development Director Wu Meng-teh was
sentenced to 12 years in prison, with his civil rights deprived for six years
after the end of his sentence. He was ordered to give the NT$2 million he took
in bribes to the national coffers.</P>
      <P>A middleman and two construction company executives were given reduced sentences
after pleading guilty to committing bribery.</P>
      <P>Chang Chih-jung, former chairman of the New Culture Foundation, had his sentence
reduced from eight months to four, while Japanese businessman Ryoji Kikawa and
Chen Chien-ting, an assistant manager of a local construction company, also had
their sentences slashed by half to two-and-a-half months and seven months,
respectively.</P>
      <P>The court found that Kikawa, a deputy manager of the Japanese construction
company Taisei Corp., paid NT$128 million (US$3.98 million) to Chen for helping
him to bribe Wu and Chung and win the bid for the CR5 project through rigging.</P>
      <P>Chen gave NT$32 million to Chang, who gave NT$3 million to Chung and NT$2
million to Wu.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Jailed blind Chinese human rights activist wins Magsaysay award</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An imprisoned blind Chinese human rights activist and a Hong Kong citizen
dedicated to curbing the spread of HIV-AIDS were among seven individuals named
Tuesday to receive the prestigious Ramon Magsaysay Award for 2007, the award
foundation said.</P>
      <P>Chen Guangcheng, 35, who is serving a four-year prison term after being
convicted for his role in publicizing a ruthless population control program in
Shandong Province in northern China, and Chung To, 40, founder of the Hong Kong-
based Chi Heng Foundation, which works to curb the spread of HIV-AIDS and erase
the stigma of those infected with the virus, share the Magsaysay award for the
Emergent Leadership category, the foundation said.</P>
      <P>Despite being blind since infancy, Chen became a "barefoot lawyer" providing
legal aid for the poor and disadvantaged. His role in publicizing a ruthless
population control program in Shandong Province, involving coerced abortions and
involuntary sterilization, led to his conviction for "disturbing public order."</P>
      <P>Chen was named by Time Magazine in 2006 as one of the "Top 100 people who shape
our world."</P>
      <P>This year's Magsaysay award also honored Tang Xiyang, 77, one of the leaders of
the environmental movement in China. He founded an environmental magazine and
organized "green camps" that introduced Chinese students to the need to protect
wildlife in their country.</P>
      <P>It is rare in recent memory that three Chinese have simultaneously won the
award, which is sometimes considered Asia's equivalent of the Nobel Prize.</P>
      <P>The Ramon Magsaysay Award was established in April 1957 by the trustees of the
Rockefeller Brothers Fund (RBF) based in New York City.</P>
      <P>With the concurrence of the Philippine government, the prize was created to
commemorate the late Philippines President Ramon Magsaysay and to perpetuate his
example of integrity in government, courageous service to the people and
pragmatic idealism within a democratic society.</P>
      <P>Every year the Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation awards prizes to Asian
individuals and organizations for achieving excellence in their respective
fields. The awards are given in six categories -- government service, public
service, community leadership, journalism, literature and creative communication
arts, peace and international understanding, and emergent leadership.</P>
      <P>This year's winners also include an Indian journalist who highlights vital
social issues, a South Korean advocate for the disabled, a Nepalese pioneer in
wireless technology and a Filipino known for fighting corruption.</P>
      <P>The sole Filipino awardee this year was Jovito Salonga, 87, a former senator
known for fighting against corruption and abuse. He was briefly jailed by the
late President Ferdinand Marcos when the dictator declared martial law in 1972.</P>
      <P>Although he has retired from politics, he remains a vocal critic of incumbent
President Arroyo, once even comparing her to Marcos.</P>
      <P>Journalist Palagummi Sainath, 50, was named for reporting on vital social issues
in India focusing on the plight of the rural poor, a sector ignored by much of
India's press, the award foundation said.</P>
      <P>Mahabir Pun, 52, born in the Himalayan foothills of western Nepal, won a
scholarship to the University of Nebraska but returned home after 20 years to
help set up a village high school.</P>
      <P>He played a crucial role in setting up a wireless network to link local schools
and villages, changing the lives of residents in these once-isolated areas, the
foundation said.</P>
      <P>Another recipient, Kim Sun-Tae, 66, was blinded by a mortar shell during the
Korean War but overcame poverty and disability to found the Siloam Eye Hospital
in 1986, an institution for treating blindness and training the blind.</P>
      <P>This year's winners will be honored in a ceremony to be held in Manila Aug. 31
when they will receive a medallion, a certificate and a cash prize.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States has not changed its stance concerning Taiwan's bid for
membership in the United Nations, a U.S. State Department official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The official was responding to a reporter's question on whether Washington has
put more pressure on President Chen Shui-bian and warned him not to carry on
with promoting the bid, in the wake of the submission of a second letter by Chen
to the United Nations applying for U.N. membership under the name of "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>"I'm not aware of any particular conversations that may have been held on this,
but U.S. views on these issues are consistent and remain the same, and I don't
think that's a surprise to anybody, " State Department Deputy spokesman Tom
Casey said during a daily press briefing.</P>
      <P>Over the past two months, State Department officials have on a number of
occasions stated that the United States does not support Taiwan's membership in
international organizations that require statehood, including the United
Nations.</P>
      <P>Also, the officials said the United States opposes any initiative that appears
designed to change Taiwan's  status unilaterally, including a referendum on
whether to apply to join the United Nations under the name of "Taiwan, " adding
that such a plan would appear to run counter to Chen's repeated commitments to
Washington.</P>
      <P>Taiwan officially filed a membership application with the United Nations July 19
in a letter signed by Chen.</P>
      <P>However, the letter was returned July 24 by the U.N. Secretariat, based on
Resolution 2758, which was adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in 1971
recognizing the representatives of the People's Republic of China government as
"the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations" and
expelling representatives of the Republic of China on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan sent another letter to the United Nations July 26 to defend its right to
gain membership in the organization.</P>
      <P>According to ROC Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang, it is unreasonable for
the U.N. Secretariat to misrepresent Resolution 2758 as recognizing that "Taiwan
is part of the People's Republic of China."</P>
      <P>Huang said the country's bid to join the United Nations under the name of
"Taiwan" has nothing to do with changing the status quo or changing the
country's official name and is instead aimed at differentiating Taiwan from the
People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>At Tuesday's press briefing at the State Department, Casey said "there is a
longstanding U.S. policy on that" when asked about President Chen's plan to make
transit stops in the United States for his planned visit to Central America in
late August.</P>
      <P>Washington has repeatedly stated that it handles requests by Taiwan's leaders to
stop over in the United States according to the principles of security, comfort,
convenience and dignity for the travelers.</P>
      <P>However, there has been speculation that Taiwan's plan to push for a referendum
on the U.N. issue despite U.S. opposition could affect Chen's transit plan.</P>

      <P>Free one-year kindergarten education will be offered to children from low-income
families beginning Wednesday, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung announced earlier in the
day.</P>
      <P>Five-year-olds from families with annual incomes lower than NT$300,000
(US$9,146) nationwide are now entitled to receive free kindergarten education as
part of the government's efforts to address the issue of declining birth rates
in the country and help reduce the financial burden of families with children,
Chang said during an Executive Yuan meeting.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, five-year-olds from families with annual incomes ranging from
NT$300,000  to NT$600,000 are entitled to attend kindergarten without having to
pay tuition fees, Chang said.</P>
      <P>A total of 81,000 kids are expected to benefit from the program, which forms the
first-phase  of an Executive Yuan project to financially aid children from low-
income or disadvantaged families, Chang added.</P>
      <P>As to programs in later phases of the project, Chang said he has instructed
Minister Without Portfolio Lin Chin-chang to map out plans and coordinate with
colleagues from other Cabinet-level agencies so as to put forth the programs
within one month.</P>

      <P>The central government has tentatively projected its 2008 budget at NT$1.7
trillion (US$51.83 billion), with the defense budget accounting for 20 percent
of the total, a senior official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Jan-yau, minister of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics, made the remarks a day after Premier Chang Chun-hsiung called an
inter-departmental budget planning meeting.</P>
      <P>Chang was quoted as having said at the meeting that the restriction of the
government's  annual expenditures at NT$1.7 trillion is aimed at maintaining the
country's global credit rating competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government is set to achieve the goal of a balanced budget by
2011, Chang said the budget deficit should be narrowed gradually.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, the government's draft 2008 budget bill lists overall revenues
at NT$1.6 trillion. As a result, the government will incur a budget deficit of
NT$100 billion.</P>
      <P>On the revenue side, tax revenues are projected at NT$1.18 trillion, marking a
6.9 percent year-on-year increase. Of the amount, stock transaction tax revenues
are projected at NT$150 billion.</P>
      <P>On the government expenditures, Hsu said, the defense budget will increase by
about NT$40 billion from the 2007 level to reach NT$340 billion. The
confidential budget for the procurement of three big-ticket weaponry systems has
also been appropriated.</P>
      <P>The budget for science and technology development is listed at NT$88 billion, up
7.5 percent from the 2007 level, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>He further  said it remains  uncertain  whether government employees, teachers
and military personnel will get a pay raise in the coming year. If a 3 percent
pay raise is to be implemented, he said, the central government must seek new
funds to finance the project.</P>
      <P>As to the national pension fund project set to be implemented next October, Hsu
said that it will mainly be financed with earnings from public-interest lottery
sales.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, the Executive Yuan has informed all agencies under its
jurisdiction of their respective expenditure ceilings for 2008.</P>
      <P>All agencies are required to draft their budget plans in line with fiscal rules
and present them for discussion at the Executive Yuan's Aug. 22 weekly meeting,
Hsu said, adding that the Executive Yuan is set to refer its 2008 budget bill to
the Legislative Yuan at the end of this month for deliberation and approval in
the next legislative session scheduled to open in September.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT terms added charges against ex-mayor 'judicial persecution'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1 (CNA)
08/01/07  16:16:20

    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) claimed Wednesday that Taipei
prosecutors' additional charges against former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou by
employing additional legal provisions is "judicial persecution."</P>
      <P>At the last court hearing held Tuesday on Ma's embezzlement case, the
prosecutors employed additional legal provisions against Ma, deciding that his
action also involved the offense of breach of trust prescribed in Article 342
and Article 134 of the Criminal Code, in addition to charges of corruption and
forgery that had been brought against him previously.</P>
      <P>Article 134 states that a public official who takes advantage of his authority,
opportunity or means afforded by his position to intentionally commit an offense
not provided for in this chapter shall be subject to harsher punishment than
that prescribed for such offense, with the prison term increased by up to one
half.</P>
      <P>The maximum punishment for breach of trust is five years in prison. Now that the
prosecution demands a one-half increase in the punishment, the prison term for
Ma could exceed seven years.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court is expected to hand down a ruling Aug. 14 on the case.</P>
      <P>Condemning the prosecutors' charges, Hsu Shao-ping, a whip of the KMT
legislative caucus, claimed that the prosecutors' moves have underlined an
accusation by President Chen Shui-bian only one day earlier that "judicial
personnel might try to interfere in the 2008 presidential election."</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu said that only the rulers in office have the
ability to manipulate the judiciary and called for judicial personnel not to
succumb to the pressure from the ruling party.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is now the KMT's candidate for the 2008 presidential election, has been
indicted on charges of embezzling NT$11.17 million from a special allowance fund
designated for his discretionary use while he served as Taipei mayor from 1998
to 2006.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors stated in their Feb. 13 indictment that the special fund was set
aside by the government to reimburse the mayor for job-related spending.</P>
      <P>They said that although the government's regulations allow the mayor to use half
of the fund by simply signing a receipt instead of providing vouchers to account
for his spending, the money should go toward job-related spending and that any
remaining funds should be returned to the government coffers.</P>
      <P>According to KMT Legislator Lin Teh-fu, the prosecutors' attempts to undermine
Ma's presidential candidacy and sway the campaigns of the presidential
candidates are "obvious" and he called for members of the judicial system to
resist pressure from the government.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lai Shyh-bao said that Frank Hsieh, the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) presidential candidate for 2008, a former mayor of
the southern port city of Kaohsiung, has also been accused of misusing special
allowance funds but has never been subpoenaed for questioning by the
prosecution, which he claimed is "proof" that the prosecution is exercising
double standards on mayoral usage of special allowance funds, despite
affirmation by the Kaohsiung prosecutors that they are still compiling their
evidence against Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Responding to the KMT lawmakers' criticism, Wang Tuoh, the whip of the DPP
legislative caucus, called for the KMT to "show some respect for the judicial
system," adding that the KMT is damaging its own image every time it accuses the
judiciary of "exerting political interference in cases" whenever a KMT
heavyweight is indicted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tariffs for seven kinds of commodities to be halved for six months</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung announced Wednesday more measures aimed at stabilizing
consumer prices, including temporarily halving the import duties for seven kinds
of commodities for a period of six months.</P>
      <P>The targeted commodities are durum wheat, wheat flour, groats and wheatmeal,
corn for feed, cornflour, corn distillers grain and soy beans.</P>
      <P>Making the announcement during a weekly Cabinet meeting, Chang instructed the
Ministry of Finance to work out related details to pave the way for the
measure's implementation.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the government has the responsibility to take steps to
relieve inflation, given the sharp rise in the wholesale price index so far this
year, owing to hikes in international oil, primary metal and commodity prices.</P>
      <P>While the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) should conduct a comprehensive
review of the floating oil pricing system, the MOEA and the Fair Trade
Commission (FTC) should closely monitor the prices of major raw materials and
consumer products to check for any abnormal fluctuations and bring to justice
those responsible for manipulating prices, Chang said.</P>
      <P>In particular, he went on, the MOEA and FTC should investigate if any
irregularities are behind a 4.7 percent hike in local corn prices when
international corn prices have dropped 17.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Chang ordered the MOEA's raw material supply/demand coordination panel to
examine the supply and demand of major consumer products and work out related
adjustment measures.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, the panel can adopt measures restricting the export of
products experiencing significant hikes, such as steel, oil, waste paper and
gravel.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the premier instructed the MOEA to step up its efforts to promote
energy conservation measures, enhance energy efficiency, speed up the
development of renewable energy and lower the demand for crude oil-based fuel to
reduce the pressure from soaring oil prices.</P>
      <P>As part of the government's efforts to ease the impact of the soaring oil prices
on businesses, the Cabinet announced last week that the state-operated petroleum
company, CPC Corp. Taiwan, will provide each mass transport operator with a
subsidy of NT$3 per liter of diesel fuel and each cab driver with a subsidy of
NT$2 per liter of gasoline.</P>

      <P>A preparatory office for the proposed Austronesian forum was formally

the ceremony.</P>
      <P>According  to the Council of Indigenous  Peoples  (CIP) , representatives from
eight countries, including six of Taiwan's South Pacific diplomatic allies and
the Philippines, met in Taipei Tuesday for discussions on the establishment of
an Austronesian forum, beginning with the setting up of the preparatory office.</P>
      <P>The move to set up the forum, which would include Taiwan, the Philippines,
Tuvalu, Nauru, Kiribati, Palau, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands, is
seen as part of efforts to implement President Chen Shui-bian's "Palau
Declaration" that Chen signed last year with his South Pacific counterparts
aimed at sharing, preserving and promoting Austronesian cultures that the eight
countries have in common, as well as strengthening relations, CIP officials
said.</P>
      <P>After its establishment, the forum is also expected to boost efforts  concerning
the holding  of academic  conferences  on Austronesian  cultures  and exchanges,
increasing  Austronesian participation in Asia-Pacific and international
organizations, and demonstrating a commitment to indigenous development,  the
CIP officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the officials said, an Austronesian Forum secretariat is expected to
be established next year in Taiwan, which will provide the majority of the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has submitted a second membership application to the United Nations after
the first one was rejected by the U.N. Secretariat, a Presidential Office
official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The application was delivered to the United Nations July 31 through  the
Solomon  Islands'  and  Swaziland's  permanent representatives to the world
body, said Lee Nan-yang, director of the Presidential Office's department of
public affairs.</P>
      <P>It was included in two letters dated July 27 and signed by President Chen Shui-
bian, which were addressed separately to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon and
Wang Guangya, rotating president of the U.N. Security Council for July and
China's permanent representative to the United Nations, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that this marks the first time the president has written to the
Security Council, in what he said is a move aimed at facilitating the discussion
of cross-Taiwan Strait issues on the U.N. platform.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, while China has repeatedly labeled Taiwan's efforts to deepen
its democratic development as moves toward de jure independence, Beijing is
trying to achieve de jure unification through the enactment of its Anti-
Secession Law and what Taiwan claims is "misrepresentation" of U.N. Resolution
2758.</P>
      <P>Under the circumstances, Taiwan must make sure its membership application is
fully discussed on every possible occasion prior to the opening of next month's
annual session of the U.N. General Assembly, to "correct international
misperceptions" of Resolution 2758, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The U.N.  Secretariat  rejected  Taiwan's  first membership application July 23
based on the resolution, which was adopted by the General Assembly in 1971
recognizing the representatives of the People's Republic of China government as
"the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations" and
expelling representatives of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Responding to a question on the issue by a CNA reporter last week, Ban pointed
out that U.N. membership is only granted to sovereign countries and that the
position of the United Nations is that Taiwan is part of China.</P>
      <P>In the latest letter to Ban, Chen said that Resolution 2758 neither grants China
the right to represent Taiwan at the United Nations, nor states that Taiwan is
either a part of China or the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Taiwan is an independent sovereign nation and that its people
have the right to participate in the United Nations.</P>
      <P>In addition, he urged Ban to process Taiwan's application according to due
procedure, because only the Security Council and the General Assembly have the
authority  to review and decide on membership applications.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan researchers reveal reasons for high SARS fatalities</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 1 (CNA)

(By Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Virologists at National Yang-Ming University (NYMU) in Taipei have discovered
the causes for the high morbidity of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) ,
indicating that mutations in a specific protein in the SARS virus can greatly
accelerate the viral replication process, university sources reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The proteins are susceptible  to mutations  once the SARS coronavirus gets
inside humans,  explained NYMU professor Chen Yi-ming, adding that the human-
type SARS viruses can thus replicate themselves 60 to 100 times faster than pre-
mutation ones, resulting in high mortality rates.</P>
      <P>Chen said that if a targeted drug aimed at reducing or even inhibiting the
relevant protein and related mechanisms can be created, humans might eventually
have an effective SARS prevention method.</P>
      <P>The understanding of the protein might also facilitate the study of cancer
metastasis, he added.</P>
      <P>The results have been published by the U.S.-based Journal of Infectious
Diseases, first in its online version July 19 and then in print in its Aug. 1
issue.</P>
      <P>Scientists have found the expression on the aggressiveness of SARS viruses is
very different in cases of civets and humans in previous studies.</P>
      <P>Based on those findings, Chen Chia-yen -- a member of Chen Yi- ming's team and
the lead author of the research paper -- conducted a series of genetic
comparisons between the SARS coronaviruses in civets and humans, leading to the
discovery of the protein mutations.</P>
      <P>Chen found that the variations not only induce apoptosis phenomena in viruses
but also greatly accelerate the replication process.</P>
      <P>During the following experiments, Chen and colleagues deployed a small
interfering RNA on the mutated protein to find that the RNA can interrupt the
replication process -- indicating a possibility in developing a new drug based
on that effect.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Openness gives learning a brand new future: Wikipedia founder</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 1 (CNA)
08/01/07  20:41:10
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A world without schools, in which children learn at home using tailor-made
textbooks and educational programs was imaginatively invoked by Wikipedia
founder Jimmy Wales Wednesday, who predicted that such a change in education
will be brought about through the "openness" and "open source" movements.</P>
      <P>The 40-year-old American internet entrepreneur, who founded the popular
multilingual web-based free content encyclopedia, attended the "Openness in the
21st Century" forum on the eve of Wikimania 2007, an international Wikimedia
conference which will be held from Aug. 3 - 5.</P>
      <P>Wikipedia, which was created in 2001 and soon grew into one of the largest
reference  Web sites,  is a model  of voluntary collaboration and global
contribution, with articles that can be edited by anyone with Internet access.</P>
      <P>"Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access
to the sum of all human knowledge, " Wales said in describing the motivation
behind Wikipedia in a 2004 interview with Slashdot. The project has been trying
to make that vision a reality through  the accumulation  of basic  and neutral
information, cross-referencing, citation and the always on-going editing.</P>
      <P>Its "peer-to-peer" editing process is far different from the "top down" process
behind the production of traditional encyclopedias and textbooks.</P>
      <P>Wales pointed to the example of software projects, which tend to grow more
robust and perform better after becoming "open-source" and being co-developed by
professional enthusiasts, while remaining free of charge.</P>
      <P>Education might undergo the same type of evolution through the introduction of a
mentality of openness, said Wales, himself a product of home-schooling who later
took a Ph. D finance program at Indiana University.</P>
      <P>The current school-based educational system is outdated and not well-suited to
serving all students' needs, he claims, then predicts that textbook copyrights
in the future will be freely licensed, and that social communities will become
major sources of knowledge production.</P>
      <P>Wales says he need look no further than his own family for an example of what is
to come. His daughter, Kira, has received all of her education at home and now
is studying third grade mathematics although still a kindergartner. Wales uses a
home-learning program he found in Singapore to help Kira with the content and
schedule of her schooling.</P>
      <P>In the future, the Internet will provide children and students with various
learning methods, he said, and best of all, deliver the knowledge at a low cost.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's total solar energy output grew by leaps and bounds in 2006 and now
ranks fifth in the world, Director-General of the Bureau of Energy under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) Yeh Huei-ching said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the total output value of solar energy in 2006 reached about NT$21.2
billion (US$644.2 million) , while the total output value in 2007 is expected to
exceed NT$43 billion and rank fourth worldwide in terms of total output.</P>
      <P>Seeking to facilitate exchanges of information and technology in this field, the
Industrial Technology Research Institute of Taiwan established the Taiwan
Photovoltaic  Industry Association,  the membership of which now includes a
total of 102 industrial firms.</P>
      <P>Association members include Motech Industries Inc., E-TON Solar Tech Co.,  Sino-
American  Silicon Products Inc.,  Green Energy Technology Inc., and TOPSOC
Semiconductor Corp.</P>
      <P>To help ensure market success, the Bureau of Energy has increased its budget to

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) formally banned waste paper exports
Wednesday as part of its efforts to maintain domestic price stability in the
face of China's raw material buying spree.</P>
      <P>The ban takes effect immediately, MOEA officials said, adding that the date for
lifting the ban has been left open.</P>
      <P>The export ban applies to all sorts of waste paper, including old newspapers,
magazines,  paper shards,  unbleached kraft paper, corrugated paper and
paperboard, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Waste paper is an important material in the production of paper for industrial
use. According to MOEA tallies, Taiwan needs about 4 million tons of waste paper
annually. In 2006, Taiwan had to import 760,000 tons of waste paper to meet
demands as only 325 tons of waste paper were recycled. Waste paper exports also
reached 32,000 tons last year.</P>
      <P>In July this year, waste paper was sold for between NT$4.2 and NT$4.6 per
kilogram, an increase of more than 60 percent over the average price of NT$2.6
recorded in January. Meanwhile waste paper exports in the first half of this
year topped 25,000 tons, a whopping 94 percent rise.</P>
      <P>Given its manufacturing industrial boom, China's demand for industrial-use paper
has increased substantially. As China's waste paper recycle system has not yet
fully developed, it has to secure supplies from around the world, pushing up
global waste paper prices, the officials said.</P>
      <P>With a view to maintaining domestic price stability and ensuing adequate waste
supplies for the production of industrial paper, the officials said the MOEA has
to suspend waste paper exports for the time being.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank Hsieh
said Tuesday that if he is elected, he will be able to realize the goal of
rectifying the country's name and enacting a new constitution in five years'
time.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also promised to give the country a new constitution within the same time
frame, but described the two moves as "not tantamount to a change in the status
quo."</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks in a TV talk show program broadcast on SANLIH
Entertainment TV.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that he is not confident that he will be able to complete the name
rectification and bring in a new constitution during his first presidential
term.</P>
      <P>However, in the fifth year following his assumption of the presidency, when
Taiwan is slated to hold its eighth legislative elections, Hsieh expects that 70
percent or 80 percent of locl voters will identify with Taiwan and therefore
support the two moves that are critical to the pursuit of making Taiwan a normal
country.</P>
      <P>Against such backdrop, Hsieh said, the DPP could garner three quarters of the
seats in the Legislative Yuan, which will be conducive to pushing for the
changes.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that he will communicate with the United States if it still opposes
Taiwan's campaign for name rectification and enactment of new constitution at
that time.</P>
      <P>Hsieh added that with the support from the majority of Taiwan's lawmakers he
will be able to convince the U.S. government by that time, although it will also
be necessary to take into account the national security and the international
situations.</P>
      <P>He stressed that he will not gamble on Taiwan's national security.</P>
      <P>Hsieh explained that the move to push for name rectification is not an attempt
to change the status quo. Rather, it is a part of the government's efforts to
transform Taiwan into a normal country.</P>
      <P>Speaking on Taiwan's U.N.-membership bid, Hsieh said that the country is not
likely to realize its goal in the near future, however, the recent bid to join
the world body under the name of Taiwan is helpful in raising the country's
international profile.</P>
      <P>Lambasting U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon's recent rejection of President
Chen Shui-bian's letter expressing Taiwan's intention to join the United Nations
as a full member, Hsieh said the world body expelled the Chiang Kai-shek regime,
not Taiwan, in 1971.</P>
      <P>Now, however, the U.N. wrongly considers Taiwan to be part of the People's
Republic of China, Hsieh criticized.</P>
      <P>The late president Chiang retreated to Taiwan after losing China to the
Communist Party and began 55 years of Kuomintang (KMT) rule in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that he supports holding a referendum aimed at backing the country's
bid to join the U.N. under the name of Taiwan, but notes that he has promised
the U.S. government that he will not hold a referendum on Taiwan's independence
if elected.</P>
      <P>He stated that Taiwan is already a sovereign, independent country, and that
there is no need to organize a referendum on Taiwan's independence.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless,  Hsieh  said that he does not rule out the possibility of
convening a referendum on Taiwan's unification with China.</P>
      <P>Noting  that few people  in the world favor the island's unification with China,
Hsieh remarked that Taiwan could use such a referendum as a diplomatic
bargaining chip in the future.</P>
      <P>In addition, Hsieh said that if elected, his administration will not, in
principle, recognize academic degrees issued by China out of consideration of
the possible impact on employment and education system in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, Hsieh said that exceptions could be made for traditional herbal
medicine accreditation, which China takes lead.</P>

to change the status quo. Rather, it is a part of the government's efforts to
transform Taiwan into a normal country.</P>
      <P>Speaking on Taiwan's U.N.-membership bid, Hsieh said that the country is not
likely to realize its goal in the near future, however, the recent bid to join
the world body under the name of Taiwan is helpful in raising the country's
international profile.</P>
      <P>Lambasting U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon's recent rejection of President
Chen Shui-bian's letter expressing Taiwan's intention to join the United Nations
as a full member, Hsieh said the world body expelled the Chiang Kai-shek regime,
not Taiwan, in 1971.</P>
      <P>Now, however, the U.N. wrongly considers Taiwan to be part of the People's
Republic of China, Hsieh criticized.</P>
      <P>The late president Chiang retreated to Taiwan after losing China to the
Communist Party and began 55 years of Kuomintang (KMT) rule in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that he supports holding a referendum aimed at backing the country's
bid to join the U.N. under the name of Taiwan, but notes that he has promised
the U.S. government that he will not hold a referendum on Taiwan's independence
if elected.</P>
      <P>He stated that Taiwan is already a sovereign, independent country, and that
there is no need to organize a referendum on Taiwan's independence.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless,  Hsieh  said that he does not rule out the possibility of
convening a referendum on Taiwan's unification with China.</P>
      <P>Noting  that few people  in the world favor the island's unification with China,
Hsieh remarked that Taiwan could use such a referendum as a diplomatic
bargaining chip in the future.</P>
      <P>In addition, Hsieh said that if elected, his administration will not, in
principle, recognize academic degrees issued by China out of consideration of
the possible impact on employment and education system in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, Hsieh said that exceptions could be made for traditional herbal
medicine accreditation, which China takes lead.</P>

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will adopt a "normal country
resolution" at its upcoming national congress to underscore its determination to
make Taiwan a normal country, a party official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Lin Jia-lung said the party's policy research unit has
drafted the proposed "normal country resolution" which clearly states that
Taiwan is an independent sovereign country and is by no means subjugated to
China's jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>The resolution also advocates rectifying the country's title as "Taiwan" and
speeding up creation of a new constitution that is timely, viable, fitting and
relevant to Taiwan, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The draft resolution will be referred to a nine-member panel under the DPP's
Central Standing Committee for a review and then be sent to the party's Central
Executive Committee for a further screening before being presented to the party
congress to be held in autumn for final approval.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan's sovereignty belongs to the people of Taiwan, Lin said
Taiwan must adopt a "normal country resolution" to tell the world of its action
plans to attain its ultimate goal of developing Taiwan into a normal and great
country. The actions will include rectifying its national designation,
formulating a new constitution, joining the United Nations, beefing up its
national identity and substantiating transitional justice.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.N. position on Taiwan's membership application unchanged: official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York,  Aug. 1 (CNA)
08/02/07  11:49:04

    <TEXT>
      <P>The United Nations' position on Taiwan's participation in the world body has not
changed despite Taiwan's request for the world body to reconsider its membership
application, a U.N. official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>After its first application was returned by the U.N. Office of Legal Affairs
July 23, Taiwan submitted a second application to the United Nations July 31 in
two letters signed by President Chen Shui-bian and addressed separately to U.N.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Wang Guangya, China's permanent representative
to the United Nations who served as rotating president of the U.N. Security
Council for July.</P>
      <P>Asked about the matter during a daily press briefing, Marie Okabe, deputy
spokeswoman for the secretary-general, said she could not confirm at this point
whether the United Nations has made an official response to the latest move by
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"But our position has not changed since the last time we were asked," Okabe
added.</P>
      <P>Okabe noted that the previous application was returned in keeping with U.N.
Resolution 2758, which she said is the basis of the "one China" policy of the
United Nations.</P>
      <P>She was referring to the resolution adopted by the General Assembly in 1971
recognizing the representatives of the People's Republic of China government as
"the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations" and
expelling representatives of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Responding to a question on the issue by a CNA reporter last week, Ban pointed
out that U.N. membership is only granted to sovereign countries and that the
position of the United Nations is that "Taiwan is part of China."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang told U.N. correspondents Wednesday that he returned Chen's
letter the same day that he received it.</P>
      <P>China's state-controlled Xinhua News Agency quoted Wang as calling Taiwan's
latest move "a very serious separatist act seeking independence for Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Expressing firm opposition to the move, Wang stressed that there is only one
China in the world and that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China, according to
Xinhua.</P>
      <P>In the latest letter to Ban, President Chen argued that U.N. Resolution 2758
neither grants China the right to represent Taiwan at the United Nations nor
states that Taiwan is either a part of China or the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Chen asserted that Taiwan is an independent sovereign nation and that its people
have the right to participate in the United Nations.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen urged Ban to process Taiwan's application according to due
procedure, because only the Security Council and the General Assembly have the
authority  to review and decide on membership applications and "the U.N.
Secretariat does not have the power to decide on such matters."</P>
      <P>The Republic of China has tried without success to re-enter the United Nations
since 1993. This year marks the first time it has changed tactics by bidding to
join the world body under the name of "Taiwan."</P>

      <P>Aircraft belonging to Taiwan-based airlines experienced a total of 1,009 bird
strikes between 2002 and 2006, according  to tallies released Thursday  by the
Flight Safety Foundation-Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Of these incidents, 82 cases occurred at airports of foreign countries, and 125
cases involved damage to the aircraft, meaning one plane was damaged for every
eight bird strike incidents on average.</P>
      <P>The tallies show that a total of 787, or 78 percent, of the bird strikes were
recorded between the months of May and November.</P>
      <P>Engines proved to be the most vulnerable part of the plane in the bird strike
incidents, with 75.6 percent of the plane damage cases involving the aircraft's
engines. Meawhile, 5.5 percent of the cases involved the wings of the aircraft,
and 4.7 percent involved the plane's nose or landing lights.</P>
      <P>Foundation officials said the incidence of bird strikes at Taiwan airports has
been declining in recent years owing to the installation of various bird
repellent devices. The number of bird strikes totalled 203 in 2002 and 237 in
2003, dropping to 198 in 2004 and further to 138 in 2005, although the figure
increased slightly to 151 in 2006, they said.</P>
      <P>During the 2002-2006 period, bird strikes resulted in a total of 26 abnormal
situations in which the aircraft was either forced to return to the airport,
give up a takeoff attempt or make an emergency landing, they said.</P>
      <P>Other abnormal situations  caused by bird strike incidents included temporary
closure of runways and cancellation of subsequent flights, they said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the foundation found that most of the bird strike incidents were
caused by species of small-sized birds commonly seen in Taiwan, such as
skylarks, house swifts, sparrows and barn swallows.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's planned transit stops in the United States during his
visit to Central America later this month are still being arranged, a Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to MOFA spokesman Wang Chien-yeh, the MOFA will file an official
request with the U.S. government for the planned transit stops at the proper
time, and no decision has so far been made as to which U.S. cities the president
will stop over in.</P>
      <P>Wang said the details of the plan will be made public when the the president's
departure date draws closer.</P>
      <P>Wang was responding to a United Daily News report that Washington has refused to
allow Chen to stop over in the continental United States or stay overnight
during the transit stops.</P>
      <P>The daily cited unidentified sources as saying that the U.S. government has done
so to show its displeasure at Taiwan's plan to push for a referendum on whether
to apply to join the United Nations under the name of "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Asked about the matter during a daily press briefing held in Washington D.C.
Wednesday, U.S. State Department Deputy Spokesman Tom Casey said he is not aware
of any formal request put forward by Taiwan for Chen's transit plan.</P>
      <P>"It would be awfully speculative of me to try and tell you what we might do or
might not do in terms of any specific requests and the timing of it," Casey
said.</P>
      <P>Casey noted that Washington's policy on transit requests by Taiwan leaders is
based on a standard adherence to both the U.S. obligations as written in the
Taiwan Relations Act and the principles of safety, comfort and convenience of
the traveler.</P>
      <P>As to Taiwan's latest referendum plan, Casey reiterated that the United States
does not want to see any unilateral changes to the status quo and hopes Taiwan

initiative in seeking professional help or joining drug rehab programs to help
them kick the habit.</P>
      <P>They said that efforts to help drug addicts kick the habit can never be too
much, adding that the MOJ will continue to strive to attain more funds from the
government so that it can collaborate more closely with the Department of Health
to help drug addicts released from prison fight their addiction to illegal
substances.</P>
      <P>National Cheng Kung University Hospital in Tainan City, southern Taiwan opened
July 20 a round-the-clock emergency room exclusively for recently released drug-
addicted prison inmates who might face difficulty  kicking the habit after 10
such people died from overdoses.</P>
      <P>A total of 9,597 prison inmates were released July 16 under the sentence
commutation statute, which is expected to benefit as many as 25,670 prisoners.
The statute was passed in early July to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the
lifting of martial law in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Among the first group of released inmates, 4,256 had been sent to prison for
drug-related offenses.</P>

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will launch a series of activities
to solicit support from around the world for Taiwan's bid to join the United
Nations under the name of Taiwan, including a massive parade in Kaohsiung slated
for Sept. 15.</P>
      <P>The decision was made at a DPP Central Standing Committee meeting Wednesday, in
which the committee also announced that it plans to seek 1.2 million endorsement
signatures before Oct. 15 to underscore Taiwan's determination to enter the
world body as a full member despite the U.N.'s recent rejection of President
Chen Shui-bian's letters requesting U.N.  membership for the country under the
name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stressed that U.N. membership is only granted
to sovereign countries and that the U.N. considers Taiwan as "a part of China."</P>
      <P>Despite the setback, the DPP is now planning to mobilize people around the world
who support Taiwan's bid to enter the world body under the name of Taiwan to
express their support Sept. 15 to coincide with the DPP's large-scale parade to
be held that day in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, in which some 50,000 people are
expected to participate.</P>
      <P>In addition, the DPP has invited Internet users to submit creative works, in
video or audio form, to relay the Taiwan people's desire to join the U.N. as a

country's major food manufacturing companies -- including Uni-President
Enterprises Corp. (UPEC) and Wei Chuan Corp. (WCC) -- hiking their dairy product
prices by between 10 percent and 15 precent.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian is courting harm to Taiwan by asking China's U.N.
Ambassador Wang Guangya, who was the rotating president of the U.N. Security
Council for July, to reconsider Taiwan's bid to join the world body in a July 27
letter, an opposition Kuomintang (KMT) official claimed Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chang Rung-kung, deputy chief of the KMT's Policy Coordination Committee,
accused Chen of seeking political gain for the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party by subjecting the county to humiliation in the international community.</P>
      <P>He described Chen as "ignorant" in his belief that his letter to Wang, and a
similar July 27 letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, could cast the
country's dispute with China into the international limelight.</P>
      <P>He likened the president's move to "shoving the Taiwan people under the wheels
of a car."</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks after a spokesman for Wang said in New York Wednesday
that Wang returned Chen's letter July 31 before his term as Security Council
chief ended.</P>
      <P>Ban had not yet acted on Chen's letter, but his spokesman said Thursday that the
U.N. Secretariat has not changed its position since it returned July 23 a
similar letter from Chen in which the president asked for Taiwan U.N. membership
under the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that Chen's administration attempted in May to join the World Health
Organization (WHO) under the name of Taiwan only to see its supporters in the

    <HEADLINE>13 members of cross-border fraud ring nabbed</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Thirteen people related to a cross-border fraud ring whose operations encompass
Taiwan, China and South Korea, were nabbed in the central counties of Taichung
and Nantou Thursday on charges of kidnapping, fraud and extortion, police in
Tainan, southern Taiwan said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Tainan police, accompanied by several Tainan City prosecutors, traveled to
central Taiwan early that morning to carry out raids on several locations in
Taichung and Nantou counties, arresting the ringleaders -- identified as Leen
Chien-teh and Sung Ming-chung -- along with 11 accomplices. Three other ring
members were reportedly still at large.</P>
      <P>The Tainan police began to investigate the crime ring last October after several
school children in Tainan City were kidnapped for ransom.</P>
      <P>The police found that the ring members had not only kidnapped school children
but had also swindled over 1,000 people in Taiwan and South Korea out of over
NT$100 million (US$3.05 million) , using a variety of scams.</P>
      <P>They also found that the ring had recruited Taiwan people with no criminal
record to travel to South Korea to work as "cells" for the ring.</P>
      <P>The ring's operations also came to the attention of the South Korea law
enforcement authorities. The South Korean government announced July 18 that it
had decided to cooperate with the governments of Taiwan and China in efforts to
crack down on cross-border fraud.</P>
      <P>South Korean Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said that due to increasingly rampant
telephone fraud by rings operating in South Korea, Taiwan and China, the South
Korean government has decided to collaborate with the Taiwanese and Chinese
authorities in cracking down on the criminals.</P>
      <P>According to South Korean government tallies, police there received 3,990
reports of telephone fraud over the past year to June 30, with the amount
swindled by fraudsters exceeding US$40 million.</P>
      <P>Han said the South Korean government therefore decided to put stricter financial
and banking measures into place, including raising the minimum balance for
foreign nationals wanting to open bank accounts in the country, to help stem
financial irregularities, including fraud operations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to Chao Chia-ming, an official from Taiwan's representative
office in Seoul, 150 citizens of Taiwan were arrested in South Korea in the
first five months of this year on charges of fraud.</P>
      <P>South Korean police said they had swindled huge amounts of money from some 3,400
South Koreans, Chao said.</P>
      <P>He quoted South Korean police as saying that the Taiwanese crime ring members
first put ads in Taiwanese newspapers to recruit people to work in South Korea.
Once they arrived in South Korea, they were trained to make telephone calls
posing as South Korean officials in charge of taxation or financial regulations
to swindle money from locals.</P>
      <P>Most of the 150 Taiwanese criminals have been convicted and handed prison
sentences ranging from three months to four years, Chao said.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has encouraged local townships to restore their
indigenous names, which he said marks the significance of self-identity among
aborigines in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks Wednesday at an inauguration ceremony of the Preparatory
Office of the Austronesian Forum, which is aimed at promoting Taiwan's
cooperation with Austronesian countries, including the Philippines, Tuvalu,
Nauru, Kiribati, Palau, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands.</P>
      <P>He expressed hope that Austronesian peoples will flourish and that the world can
learn about Austronesian culture.</P>
      <P>Austronesia, in historical terms, refers to the homeland of the people who speak
Austronesian languages, to which Malay, Filipino, Indonesian, Malagasy, native
Hawaiian, the Fijian language and around a thousand other languages belong. The
Austronesian homeland is thought by linguists to have been prehistoric Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The name Austronesia comes from the Latin australis "southern" plus the Greek
nesos "island".</P>
      <P>The government passed an amendment to the Constitution 13 years ago that
replaced the derogatory term "mountain countrymen" with "indigenous peoples" in
the Constitution, which Chen said was a historic milestone in the history of
indigenous peoples' campaign to rectify their names.</P>
      <P>Describing name rectification as a crucial part of a country's transitional
justice process, Chen said he instructed the Executive Yuan to offer assistance
to indigenous people a long time ago and as a result,  the number of aboriginal
tribes recognized by the government has increased from nine to 13.</P>
      <P>Chen said he also ordered the Cabinet in June 2005 to designate Aug. 1 as
Indigenous Peoples Day, a policy he said was slated to take effect Jan. 1, 2006
but was postponed due to the delayed passage of a relevant bill through the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Calling for early passage of the bill, Chen said designating an Indigenous
Peoples Day will help raise public awareness of Taiwan's diverse indigenous
cultures.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung city government's plan to build a light rail system to complement
its mass rapid transit railway has met strong opposition in the City Council,
with most council members favoring a bus rapid transit system instead.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet approved a plan submitted by the Kaohsiung city government in early
2004 to build a light rail system. The Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit Bureau is
currently working on a 19.6 km light rail circular route budgeted at a cost of
NT$11.4 billion (US$345.83 million), with 75 percent of the funds coming from
central government subsidies.</P>
      <P>City Council Speaker Chuang Chi-wang said Thursday that light rail is no longer
embraced by cities in other countries as the centerpiece of their regional
transportation systems.</P>
      <P>He said the light rail system contradicts the city's goal of moving underground
all electric wires and cables in the city.</P>
      <P>Chuang suggested that Kaohsiung should adopt a "bus rapid transit" (BRT) system
instead. His suggestion was supported by many city councilors.</P>
      <P>BRT refers to a high-quality bus service that is comparable to rail transi but
still enjoys the cost savings of bus transit. While the construction cost for
light rail is about NT$NT$600 million per km, the cost to build a BRT system is
estimated at NT$60 million per km.</P>
      <P>Wang Kuo-tsai, director of the Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit Bureau, acknowledged
the convenience provided by the BRT system, but added the light rail system can
coexist with the BRT system.</P>
      <P>Huang Shu-mei,  a city councilor of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party,
said there is no reason for Kaohsiung to abandon a light rail project already
approved by the central government. She added that she supports the light rail
project because it is pollution free and environmentally friendly.</P>

      <P>Using a unique discussion format, an "unconference" on the theme of citizen
journalism, reflective of the "bottom-up" characteristic of Web 2.0, kicked off
Wikimania 2007, an international Wikimedia conference, Thursday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The Citizen Journalism Unconference (CJU) was a side event of the main Wikimania
2007, to be held in Taiwan for the first time from Aug. 3 - 5 at Chien Tan
Overseas Youth Activity Center.</P>
      <P>Unlike conferences employing top-down discussions, the CJU used an Open Space
technique to allow participants to manage their own agenda by first announcing
the topics in which they are interested before splitting the participants into
eight to 10 discussion groups focusing on various topics.</P>
      <P>Moderated by facilitators and conducted with the "law of two feet", which means
participants could join or leave the discussion at any time, about 100
participants of various nationalities started discussion groups of six to eight
persons.</P>
      <P>"I don't have any money. I want to know whether citizen journalism can be
profitable, " said Singaporean blogger Preetam Rai, who was in charge of Global
Voices Online South East Asia. Naturally, Rai join the discussion on citizen
journalism funding and joint ventures.</P>
      <P>Other topics raised in discussions included "Citizen Journalism vs.
Professionalism," "Journalistic Passion and Enthusiasm," "Ethical Concerns
Citizen Journalism Creates, " and "the Relationship Between Traditional Media
and Citizen Journalism."</P>
      <P>Well-known local bloggers, such as Schee, Eric "Ilya" Lee, and Chiao Ching,
acted as facilitators in the discussions, as did staff from PeoPo.org, a citizen
journalism platform initiated by Taiwan Public Television Service.</P>
      <P>This year's  Wikimania,  which  will be the third  annual international
Wikimedia conference, was co-organized by the Wikimedia Foundation and Academia
Sinica's Institute of Information Science. It is both a scientific conference
and a community event, bringing together bloggers and members of various
Wikimedia projects.</P>
      <P>The Wikimedia Foundation is a non-profit organization that supports nine free
information project, including Wikipedia. It is a multilingual, web-based, free
content encyclopedia project. It was created in 2001 and soon grew into one of
the largest reference Web sites, with articles that can be edited by anyone with
Internet access.</P>
      <P>More than 50 seminars and workshops will be held during the event's three days,
which is expected to attract more than 350 participants from all over the world.
Registration staff said that the number of registered participants exceeded
1,000, but many of these will be unable to participate due to a variety of

demonstrating a slow motion Chinese martial art tai chi winning the acclaim of
many.</P>
      <P>In addition to offering the audience a chance to experience personally how to
manipulate a robot, the organizer also introduced the history of robotic
development in the country and exhibited a variety of relevant components.</P>
      <P>Chan said the Taiwanese people have little knowledge of robots, and that is why
the PMC organized the robot exhibition at this year's computer application show.
However, he added, many people do not understand that most of the chips used in
robots around the world are made by Taiwanese companies.</P>
      <P>To boost Taiwan's robot industry, the PMC will cooperate with the Ministry of
Economic Affairs in forming a platform for the general public to join in the
PMC's design work, Chan said.</P>
      <P>Noting that robotics involves many other high-tech spheres, including machinery,
information,  electronics,  and electrical engineering, Chan welcomed students
to join in their work so as to establish a strong robotic industry in the
country.</P>
      <P>Citing the example of Japan, which boasts a well-established robotics industry
due to its heavy dependence on robots to do the most dangerous, repetitive and
boring jobs, Chan said Taiwanese society also needs more robots to help in
caring for elderly people in the future given the aging of the island's
population.</P>

      <P>Locally-developed genechips capable of detecting human papillomavirus (HPV) and
speeding up HPV genotyping while maintaining a high degree of accuracy were
formally approved by the Department of Health (DOH) Thursday for sale in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The HPV detection genechips, carrying the brand name "Easychip HPV Blot, " were
developed some two years ago by a biotech company associated with King Car Food
Inc.</P>
      <P>Approval of "Easychip HPV Blot" genechips makes the King Car biotech company one
of only a few firms in the world to have successfully researched, developed and
brought to market genechips for HPV genotyping.</P>
      <P>"Easychip HPV Blot" genechips are capable of identifying the genotypes of 15 of
17 high-risk types of HPV via a polymerase chain reaction-based method. Such
virus types have been implicated in cervical  carcinoma,  which  must be treated
with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical surgery, according to a corporate
source.</P>
      <P>So far, the "Easychip HPV Blot" genechips are not covered by the national health
insurance, and will cost patients some NT$2,000, though they will mean a quicker
and more accurate HPV genotyping enabling doctors to better decide how to treat
such infections.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has approved a series of measures to provide educational
subsidies for disadvantaged students from low-income families, a Ministry of
Education (MOE) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The policy, which will be implemented from the new academic year -- will benefit
about 658,000 people, including preschoolers and students at elementary schools,
high schools, colleges and universities.</P>
      <P>Five-year-olds from families with an annual income of less than NT$300,000
(US$9,100) will be entitled to study for free in public kindergartens. Those
from families with an annual income between NT$300,000 and NT$600,000 will
receive subsidies covering tuition for public kindergarten, but their families
will still need to pay for other expenditures.</P>
      <P>About 81,000 children will benefit from the measure, which will cost the
government about NT$800 million per semester, the official said.</P>
      <P>The MOE will also earmark NT$900 million annually to help each elementary and
junior high school in the country to open one class providing free after-school
education to disadvantaged students, which will help about 180,000 students.</P>
      <P>High school students from families with an annual income of less than NT$300,000
will receive an educational subsidy of NT$34,000, while those from families with
an annual income of between NT$300,000 and NT$600,000, will qualify for
financial aid of NT$20,000. About 187,000 high school students will benefit from
the policy.</P>
      <P>Students on a five-year college course and whose annual household income is less
than NT$300,000 will get an annual subsidy of NT$34,000 for the first three
years, the official said.</P>
      <P>University students from low income families will be entitled to financial aid
in four categories -- a grant, emergency relief, work-study and free dormitory
housing -- with the highest subsidy amount being NT$73,000 in one academic year
with further reductions in tuition and miscellaneous expenditures. The measure,
which will cost NT$1.6  billion  per year,  will benefit  nearly 210,000
disadvantaged students.</P>

      <P>The new educational subsidy program will provide financial aid to about 210,000
disadvantaged college and university students, Deputy Minister of Education Wu
Tsai-shun said Thursday.</P>
      <P>College and university students from low-income families will be entitled to
four categories of financial aid including grants, emergency relief, work-study,
and free dormitory housing, together with further subsidies for tuition and
miscellaneous costs and other fees.</P>
      <P>In addition to college and university  students,  the new educational subsidy
program approved by the Executive Yuan Wednesday will provide subsidies to
preschoolers, and students in elementary schools and high schools from
disadvantaged families.</P>
      <P>College students from families with an annual household income less than
NT$700,000 (US$21,225)  will be eligible for annual subsidies of about NT$34,000
in grants. Applications will be rated on a five grade scale, with the most
disadvantaged students receiving the greatest subsidies.</P>
      <P>Within the work-study category, schools will provide jobs for students in
financial need, allowing them to earn NT$5,000 in monthly wages to help pay for
education expenses.</P>
      <P>Schools will also provide emergency relief to students in need and will provide
1 percent of dormitory space free of charge to house disadvantaged students.</P>
      <P>A student at a private college from a low-income family, who has to spend
NT$210,000 on tuition and miscellaneous expenditures for one academic year, will
be subsidized to the tune of NT$73,000 in grants and work-study subsidies,
reducing the student's debt load by 34 percent.</P>
      <P>Also under the new program,  10 percent of the subsidies previously provided to
private colleges and universities will be transferred to disadvantaged students
in order to help reduce their miscellaneous costs and other fees.</P>
      <P>These subsidies would reduce a hypothetical student's loan burden from
NT$500,000 to NT$368,000. With lower loan interest rates and a longer repayment
schedule, future monthly payment for the student will be reduced 48 percent,
from NT$6,048 to NT$3,124.</P>
      <P>Wu said students may submit applications for subsidies until the end of October.
Detailed information is available at the Ministry of Education's Website, or via
the hotline: 0800-056-668.</P>

      <P>First-run foreign movies enjoyed box office receipts 63.5 times greater than
that of Taiwanese films in Taipei City in 2006, bringing in NT$2.54 billion
(US$77 million) and NT$40 million (US$1.21 million) respectively.</P>
      <P>An official of the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics said
the total box office take of Taipei City's first-run theaters last year was
NT$2.68 billion, up 0.2 percent over 2005.</P>
      <P>Box office receipts for films made in Hong Kong and China took in a small margin
of the total at NT$100 million, though even that amount exceeded the take of
Taiwanese films.</P>
      <P>The movie industry enjoyed NT$14.4 billion in sales in 2006, an increase of 9.6
percent over 2005, with the largest sectors being theaters, at NT$6.29 billion,
and distributors, at NT$5.66 billion.</P>
      <P>The official  said statistics  compiled  by the Government Information Office
and the Ministry of Finance show that the Taiwanese film industry performed
sluggishly in terms of the number of companies, number of theater visitors, and
the number of awards won.</P>
      <P>Taipei City's first-run movie theater visitors in 2006 hit the number of 11.36
million. Among them, 10.74 visitors were for foreign movies, 420,000 visitors
were for Hong Kong movies and films made in China, while only 200,000 visitors
were for Taiwanese movies.</P>
      <P>There were a total of 563 companies in the movie industry in 2006, 29 fewer than
592 at the end of 2005. Among these, the number of movie distribution companies
fell from 220 to 211, and the number of film theaters slid from 164 to 151.</P>
      <P>Moreover, a total of 307 Taiwanese films were included in international film

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Malaysian man of Chinese ancestry was arrested Thursday at Taoyuan
International Airport after law enforcement agents found 35,000 nimetazepam
tablets -- a hypnotic drug -- in his luggage.</P>
      <P>The man, identified as Lim Swee-chye, 29, was about to leave for Malaysia via
Hong Kong aboard a Cathay Pacific Airways flight when Investigation Bureau
agents and customs officials stopped him and asked to check all of his luggage.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Bureau Taoyuan County office in Taoyuan County told the CNA
that agents had kept the man under surveillance after receiving a tip-off from
their colleagues in Taipei about his drug-related activities.</P>
      <P>Lim concealed the nimetazepam tablets, weighing 9.25 kilograms in total, in
eight bags in the guise of corn chip snacks, and placed the bags in his check-in
luggage, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>The Investigation Bureau received information that Lim stayed in a five-star
hotel in Taipei at the expense of a drug trafficker in Malaysia. He probably
agreed to smuggle the illicit drug because, as a failed businessman deep in
debt, he needed the money badly, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Nimetazepa is a highly hypnotic, benzodiazepine derived drug. It possesses
anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties.</P>
      <P>Because the drug has been subject to abuse, especially by persons addicted to
amphetamines or opiates, it is no longer sold in most Western nations, but is
still subject to significant abuse in some Southeast Asian countries, including
Japan and Malaysia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC protests PRC envoy's return of President Chen's letter</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 2 (CNA)
08/02/07  23:52:06
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) issued a strong protest Thursday against the
return by the Chinese permanent representative to the United Nations of
President Chen Shui-bian's letter  asking the world body reconsider  Taiwan's
membership application.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun voiced the protest at an impromptu news conference
on behalf of the Cabinet-level council that charts Taiwan's policy on China
after Wang Guangya told U.N. correspondents Wednesday that he returned Chen's
letter the same day he received it.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China, Wang, who served as the
rotating president of the U.N. Security Council for July, called Taiwan's U.N.
bid as a serious separatist act seeking independence for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In response, Liu said Wang's remarks reflect China's hegemonic attitude toward
Taiwan, which will only result in a backlash from the people of Taiwan and drive
the two sides further apart.</P>
      <P>Liu went on to stress that Taiwan has never been a part of the People's Republic
of China (PRC) as Wang claimed.</P>
      <P>And China's refusal to recognize Taiwan's independent sovereignty and the fact
that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait do not belong to each other forms the
most fundamental and greatest obstacle to cross-strait relations, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Worse still, Liu said, China has continued employing U.N. Resolution 2758 to
back up its absurd and incongruous "one China" policy and denigrate Taiwan's
sovereign status in an attempt to achieve "de jure unification" of the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Besides pulling out all the stops in its attempts to deny Taiwan's statehood,
block Taiwan's participation in the world organizations and lure away Taiwan's
diplomatic allies, Liu said China has also stepped up saber-rattling and missile
deployment against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liu said the international community should not ignore the perilous development
in China's intensified military buildup which has endangered balance of power
across the Taiwan Strait and caused anxiety among Asia-Pacific countries.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's peaceful appeal for collective security and participation
in major world bodies transcends any ideological thinking with regard to
independence or unification, Liu said the pursuit reflects Taiwan's mainstream
public opinion.</P>
      <P>Stressing Taiwan has overcome many difficulties establishing a democratic
political system, Liu said the international community should recognize its
contribution to maintaining regional peace and promoting regional prosperity
over the past decades.</P>
      <P>Liu further said Taiwan's quest for U.N. representation is aimed at contributing
to world peace and safeguarding its 23 million people's basic human rights.</P>
      <P>After its first application was returned by the U.N. Office of Legal Affairs
July 23, Taiwan submitted a second application to the United Nations July 31 in
two letters signed by President Chen and addressed separately to U.N. Secretary-
General Ban Ki-moon and Wang Guangya.</P>
      <P>Asked about the matter during a daily press briefing, Marie Okabe, deputy
spokeswoman for the secretary-general, said Wednesday she could not confirm at
this point whether the United Nations has made an official response to the
latest move by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"But our position has not changed since the last time we were asked," Okabe
added.</P>
      <P>Okabe noted that the previous application was returned in keeping with U.N.
Resolution 2758, which she said is the basis of the "one China" policy of the
United Nations.</P>
      <P>She was referring to the resolution adopted by the General Assembly in 1971
recognizing the representatives of the People's Republic of China government as
"the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations" and
expelling representatives of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>In the latest letter to Ban, President Chen argued that U.N. Resolution 2758
neither grants China the right to represent Taiwan at the United Nations nor
states that Taiwan is either a part of China or the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Chen asserted that Taiwan is an independent sovereign nation and that its people
have the right to participate in the United Nations.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen urged Ban to process Taiwan's application according to due
procedure, because only the Security Council and the General Assembly have the
authority  to review and decide on membership applications and "the U.N.
Secretariat does not have the power to decide on such matters."</P>
      <P>The Republic of China has tried without success to re-enter the United Nations
since 1993. This year marks the first time it has changed tactics by bidding to
join the world body under the name of "Taiwan."</P>

      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) issued a strong protest Thursday against the
return by the Chinese permanent representative to the United Nations of
President Chen Shui-bian's letter  asking the world body reconsider  Taiwan's
membership application.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun voiced the protest at an impromptu news conference
on behalf of the Cabinet-level council that charts Taiwan's policy on China
after Wang Guangya told U.N. correspondents Wednesday that he returned Chen's
letter the same day he received it.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China, Wang, who served as the
rotating president of the U.N. Security Council for July, called Taiwan's U.N.
bid as a serious separatist act seeking independence for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In response, Liu said Wang's remarks reflect China's hegemonic attitude toward
Taiwan, which will only result in a backlash from the people of Taiwan and drive
the two sides further apart.</P>
      <P>Liu went on to stress that Taiwan has never been a part of the People's Republic
of China (PRC) as Wang claimed.</P>
      <P>And China's refusal to recognize Taiwan's independent sovereignty and the fact
that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait do not belong to each other forms the
most fundamental and greatest obstacle to cross-strait relations, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Worse still, Liu said, China has continued employing U.N. Resolution 2758 to
back up its absurd and incongruous "one China" policy and denigrate Taiwan's
sovereign status in an attempt to achieve "de jure unification" of the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Besides pulling out all the stops in its attempts to deny Taiwan's statehood,
block Taiwan's participation in the world organizations and lure away Taiwan's
diplomatic allies, Liu said China has also stepped up saber-rattling and missile
deployment against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liu said the international community should not ignore the perilous development
in China's intensified military buildup which has endangered balance of power
across the Taiwan Strait and caused anxiety among Asia-Pacific countries.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's peaceful appeal for collective security and participation
in major world bodies transcends any ideological thinking with regard to
independence or unification, Liu said the pursuit reflects Taiwan's mainstream
public opinion.</P>
      <P>Stressing Taiwan has overcome many difficulties establishing a democratic
political system, Liu said the international community should recognize its
contribution to maintaining regional peace and promoting regional prosperity
over the past decades.</P>
      <P>Liu further said Taiwan's quest for U.N. representation is aimed at contributing
to world peace and safeguarding its 23 million people's basic human rights.</P>
      <P>After its first application was returned by the U.N. Office of Legal Affairs
July 23, Taiwan submitted a second application to the United Nations July 31 in
two letters signed by President Chen and addressed separately to U.N. Secretary-
General Ban Ki-moon and Wang Guangya.</P>
      <P>Asked about the matter during a daily press briefing, Marie Okabe, deputy
spokeswoman for the secretary-general, said Wednesday she could not confirm at
this point whether the United Nations has made an official response to the
latest move by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"But our position has not changed since the last time we were asked," Okabe
added.</P>
      <P>Okabe noted that the previous application was returned in keeping with U.N.
Resolution 2758, which she said is the basis of the "one China" policy of the
United Nations.</P>
      <P>She was referring to the resolution adopted by the General Assembly in 1971
recognizing the representatives of the People's Republic of China government as
"the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations" and
expelling representatives of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>In the latest letter to Ban, President Chen argued that U.N. Resolution 2758
neither grants China the right to represent Taiwan at the United Nations nor
states that Taiwan is either a part of China or the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Chen asserted that Taiwan is an independent sovereign nation and that its people
have the right to participate in the United Nations.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen urged Ban to process Taiwan's application according to due
procedure, because only the Security Council and the General Assembly have the
authority  to review and decide on membership applications and "the U.N.
Secretariat does not have the power to decide on such matters."</P>
      <P>The Republic of China has tried without success to re-enter the United Nations
since 1993. This year marks the first time it has changed tactics by bidding to
join the world body under the name of "Taiwan."</P>

      <P>Swaziland's ambassador to the United Nations has received a letter containing
Taiwan's U.N. membership application which was returned by Wang Guangya,
China's U.N. ambassador who served as rotating president of the U.N. Security
Council for July, Taiwan officials posted in New York said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The letter, signed by President Chen Shui-bian, was delivered July 31 to Wang

      <P>Eighty percent of Taiwan kindergarten and elementary school children drink
sugar-containing beverages everyday, an unhealthy habit which has caused many of
the children to become overweight or underweight, according to the results of a
survey released Friday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the John Tung Foundation in April and May on more
than 1,500 kindergarten children and 1,000 elementary school children around
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 80 percent of these children drink beverages such as soda
and milk tea everyday, and most of them prefer sugar-containing beverages to
plain water when asked to make a choice.</P>
      <P>Hsu Huei-yu, director of the foundation's nutrition division, noted that while
beverages with sugar usually contain a high level of calories that can lead to
obesity, consuming beverages together with other food can affect children's
appetite and thus cause them to become underweight.</P>
      <P>Among the children who drink sugar-containing beverages everyday, 30 percent of
boys and 20 percent of girls are overweight, and 20 percent of boys and 30
percent of girls are underweight, according to Hsu.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that parents have a crucial influence on the dietary habits and
food preferences of their children, Hsu said many of the surveyed children
developed the habit of drinking sugar-containing beverages because their parents
have such habit and have stocked the products at home.</P>
      <P>She urged  parents  to set  a good  example  and  reject sugar-containing
beverages in order to correct their children's dietary habits.</P>

      <P>A 15-month-old child, confirmed to be the first severe enterovirus type 71 (E71)
case this year in Taiwan, is still struggling in a pediatric intensive care unit
in Hsinchu County, northern Taiwan, the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH)
reported Friday.</P>
      <P>According to Chou Chih-hao, deputy director-general of the DOH's Center for
Disease Control (CDC) , the infant was admitted to the Hsinchu hospital in mid-
July after first developing symptoms of hand-foot-mouth disease, including high
fever, vomiting, decreased energy and loss of appetite.</P>
      <P>The infant's condition worsened after being admitted to hospital, with the
infant developing fast breathing, increased heart beat and spasms, then
dysfunction of the heart and lungs, before eventually falling into a coma, Chou
said.</P>
      <P>The infant currently remains in a coma, according to Chou.</P>
      <P>Severe E71 -- the deadliest type of all enterovirus infections -- almost turned
Taiwan upside down in the summer of 1998 when 405 children were infected, with
78 of the kids eventually dying.</P>
      <P>In an outbreak of E71 in 2005, 145 children were infected, with 15 perishing,
according to CDC tallies.</P>
      <P>None of the family members of the infant,  including the grandparents, parents
and siblings, who all live together, have been found to be infected with E71,
according to Chou.</P>
      <P>Chou said that although the peak season for enterovirus infection is nearly over
this year, people, especially children, should maintain good personal hygiene
and wash their hands often in order to avoid being infected.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China's demand of severing ties with Taiwan 'odious': Nicaraguan VP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Panama City, Aug. 2 (CNA)
08/03/07  15:01:35

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nicaraguan Vice President Jaime Morales Carazo has termed as "odious" China's
imposition of the precondition that Nicaragua sever ties with Taiwan before it
can establish formal diplomatic relations with Beijing.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Nicaraguan daily El Neuvo Diario Wednesday, Morales
described China's high-handed requirement as an act of "yellow imperialism."</P>
      <P>China has sought to resume diplomatic relations with Nicaragua since the
Sandinistas returned to power early this year. But it has demanded that
Nicaragua first sever its diplomatic ties with the Republic of China on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Claiming that China's economic progress has been achieved at the expense of
freedom, democracy and social welfare, Morales sid only 200 million of China's
1.3 billion citizens have benefited from the country's economic progress, with
the remaining 1.1 billion being excluded as "non-existent."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the world's leading Spanish-language news agency, EFE, reported
Thursday that Morales is scheduled to visit Taiwan Aug. 12-16 to reinforce
relations between the two countries. He will be the first high-ranking
Nicaraguan official to visit Taiwan since the Sandinistas returned to power.</P>
      <P>Morales told EFE that he will depart Managua Aug.10 for an official visit to
Taiwan at the invitation of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette
Lu.</P>
      <P>In addition to lending support to Taiwan's cause, Morales said he will also take
advantage of his visit to express the gratitude of the Nicaraguan government and
people for Taiwan's assistance in various fields over the past years.</P>
      <P>According to Morales, Taiwan has recently donated US$30 million for the building
of a 30-megawatt thermal power plant in Nicaragua to help the country solve its
electricity shortage problem.</P>
      <P>Morales said Taiwan has also promised to invest in Nicaragua's export processing
zone and other development projects, but he didn't elaborate.</P>
      <P>When the Ortega-led Sandinista National Liberation Front was in power for the
first time between 1985 and 1990, Nicaragua switched diplomatic  allegiance from
Taipei to Beijing.  The Nicaraguan government resumed diplomatic ties with
Taiwan after Violeta Chamorro took power in 1990.</P>
      <P>Since regaining the presidency early this year, Ortega has reaffirmed on many
occasions his determination to maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan, even
after another Central American country, Costa Rica, switched diplomatic
recognition from Taipei to Beijing in June.</P>

      <P>Noting that industrial fuel oil prices in Taiwan are generally lower than those
in neighboring countries by about NT$1,000-2,000 per 1,000 liters, Chen said
that his ministry will do its best to maintain prices at the lowest possible

edge over their competitors, such as South Korea.</P>
      <P>Chen added that in the face of spiraling international crude oil prices, the

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that Taiwan should continue to work toward
the goal of becoming a "technological innovator, " after the country's
industrial structure has  been  transformed  from  a labor-intensive  one  into
a knowledge-intensive one.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while addressing the opening of a science show in Taipei.</P>
      <P>In what he said proves the excellence of Taiwan's capabilities in terms of
innovation and research and development, Chen noted that Taiwan's innovative
competitiveness was rated second in Asia by the U.K.-based Economist
Intelligence Unit.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 14 Taiwanese businesses were included on the list of the world's top
100 performers in the information technology industry released July 2 by the
U.S.-based BusinessWeek, Chen pointed out.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, although natural resources are lacking in Taiwan,  talent,
knowledge and innovation are precious assets possessed by the country.</P>
      <P>Through the joint efforts of the government and private sectors over the past
seven years, Taiwan has seen the production values of its semiconductor and
panel industries top NT$1 trillion per year, he said.</P>
      <P>The government is now providing various incentives to boost the development of
the precision machinery, communication electronics, and bio-technology
industries, with the goal of increasing their production values to NT$1 trillion
per year, he said.</P>
      <P>The president said the government will work to bringing new meaning and value to
the "Made in Taiwan" logo, and equating "Taiwan" with the concepts of quality,
safety, innovation and humanity.</P>

      <P>Prosecutors from the central county of Changhua carried out raids on 10
locations throughout  Taiwan Thursday, seizing 1,374 kg of the banned veterinary
drug ractopamine and a smaller amount of animal antibiotic nalectin.</P>
      <P>The Changhua prosecutors,  accompanied  by Changhua police, traveled to Taipei
City in northern Taiwan that day to search the office of an international
trading company, from where they brought company owner, surnamed Ho, to the
Changhua District Prosecutor's Office for questioning, and confiscated 750 kg of
ractopamine that the company has imported from China for sales to Taiwan pig or
poultry farms.</P>
      <P>The Changhua prosecutors and police then drove to the southern port city of
Kaohsiung, where they searched the office of an animal feed dealer and
discovered 624 kg of ractopamine.</P>
      <P>Ractopamine is used by some foreign farmers to promote the growth of lean meat
in pigs, but the drug is banned in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors and police also traveled around the counties of Changhua, Tainan
and Kaohsiung later that day to visit eight other pig farms and feed dealers to
gain a better understanding of the situation concerning the use and distribution
of ractopamine.</P>
      <P>All pig farm owners and dealers visited admitted that they have fed the drug to
the pigs they have raised, or sold the drug to hog farmers.</P>
      <P>Also at the Taipei international trading company, prosecutors discovered 150 kg
of banned animal antibiotic drug nalectin, also known as chloramphenicol.</P>
      <P>Ho was later released on NT$100,000 bail.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors are striving to find out whether ractopamine has also been sold to
other poultry farms islandwide as a food additive.</P>
      <P>A ractopamine scare has gripped the country recently after two shipments of U.S.
pork were found to contain residue of the banned drug ractopamine. Portions of
those shipments, totaling about 1,000 kg, have already entered the domestic meat
markets and presumably been consumed.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine under the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture decided last October to ban all drugs used
by farmers as food additives to boost the growth of lean meat in pigs, including
ractopamine, after cases were reported abroad concerning the effect of such
drugs on consumers' cardiac and neural systems.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Monument to be built in memory of democratic trailblazer</HEADLINE>

      <P>A monument will be built at the Toucheng exit of the Hsuehshan Tunnel in the
northeastern county of Yilan in memory of Chiang Wei-shui, one of Taiwan's
democratic trailblazers.</P>
      <P>A ground-breaking ceremony was held at the monument site Thursday with Premier
Chang Chun-hsiung attending.</P>
      <P>The Hsuehshan Tunnel is the centerpiece of the "Chiang Wei-shui Freeway" that
links Taipei and Yilan counties. The 54.3-km freeway was named after Chiang in
view of his contribution to the nation's political democratization.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the ceremony, Chang said Chiang was a physician and forerunner of
the Taiwanese nationalist movement under Japan's colonial rule. He formed the
first political party in Taiwan and spared no effort in pursuing the welfare of
the less privileged people. Chiang, who was born in 1891 in Yilan, was
imprisoned more than 10 times during his lifetime for defying the orders of
then-Japanese authorities.</P>
      <P>Chiang's founding of the "Taiwan People's Party" laid a solid foundation for
Taiwan's democratic movements, Chang stressed.</P>
      <P>The Chiang Wei-shui Freeway, previously known as the Peiyi Freeway, begins in
Taipei's Nankang district and ends in Yilan's Suao township. The most difficult
part of the construction project was the 12.9-km Hsuehshan Tunnel, the longest
highway tunnel in East Asia and the fifth-longest in the world.</P>
      <P>Due to the complicated and difficult geographic structures in the tunnel, 25
workers died during the construction. Chang said the monument will also be in
commemoration of engineers and workers who sacrificed  their  lives for tunnel
construction.  The tunnel significantly reduces the travel time between Taipei
and Yilan.</P>
      <P>With a price tag of NT$100 billion (US$3.04 billion) , the Hsuehshan  Tunnel,
considered  by some foreign experts to be "impossible to build, " was opened to
traffic June 16 last year after 15 years of work.</P>
      <P>Minister of Transportation and Communications Tsai Duei and Chiang's 94-year-old
son Chiang Sung-hui were also present at the ground-breaking ceremony.</P>

      <P>Legislators of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) urged the government Friday to
examine all aged bridges in Taiwan to prevent a mishap similar to the bridge
collapse two days ago in America's Minnesota State from happening.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmakers made the appeal at a press conference after watching horrific
television footage showing a 40-year-old bridge in Minneapolis collapsing during
rush hour, sending cars and trucks tumbling into the Mississippi River, killing
at least four people, and leaving some 30 more missing.</P>
      <P>Hsu Shao-ping, a KMT legislative caucus whip, pointed out that Taiwan has 942
bridges that are more than 40 years old, including 68 bridges that have been
classified as "dangerous" and 10 bridges that are more than 60 years old.</P>
      <P>There are an additional 8,000 bridges of unknown age, Hsu said, adding that more
than half of these bridges are not regularly examined or maintained by central
or local government agencies.</P>
      <P>She added that last year only 11 of Taiwan's 23 cities and counties had set
aside budgets for bridge maintenance.</P>
      <P>She urge the government to attach greater importance to human lives by drawing a
lesson from the U.S. collapse and taking precautionary measures to give all aged
bridges in Taiwan a complete physical check-up.</P>

      <P>A group of Taiwanese lawmakers and human rights activists have announced that a
worldwide torch relay will be launched Aug. 9 to call for world attention to
human rights violations in China.</P>
      <P>The relay will kick off in Athens and pass through over 100 cities all over the
world, William C.T. Lai, a ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmaker
and head of the Asian chapter of the Coalition to Investigation the Persecution
of Falun Gong, said at a press conference Thursday.</P>
      <P>The announcement came months after Taiwan rejected the 2008 Beijing Olympic
torch because China was including the country as part of China's domestic relay
route.</P>
      <P>According to Beijing's proposal, the torch would have gone from Vietnam's Ho Chi
Minh City to Taipei and depart to Hong Kong and Macau. However, Taiwan insisted
that the torch enter and exit via a third country as part of its efforts to
safeguard its national sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the human rights torch relay will "reveal the inside story of the
bloody Olympics, " Lai said Beijing's new ban on 43 types of people it considers
"hostile" from taking part in the 2008 Olympic Games and relevant activities has
violated the basic spirit of the games.</P>
      <P>The Olympic spirit is supposed to promote harmony through fair competition, Lai
said. However, China has listed 43 types of people who will be banned even if
they are invited by the International Olympic Committee.</P>
      <P>The forbidden people include Falun Gong practitioners, Chinese defectors,  pro-
democracy  activists,  religious extremists  and infiltrators, as well as
journalists who "may jeopardize the event," according to Lai.</P>
      <P>Twu Shiing-jer, a member of the chapter and a former head of the Department of
Health (DOH), claimed that such a ban will exclude 90 percent of the Taiwan
public.</P>
      <P>On top of terrorists, China screens out the other listed people simply because
it cannot tolerate those who hold different opinions, Twu said, urging the
public to boycott the games.</P>

      <P>Wikipedia will try to communicate with China on its blockage of the popular
reference Web site, as well as the intellectual property rights infringement
issue, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales said in a press conference in Taipei
Friday.</P>
      <P>Wikipedia is still being blocked -- at least partially -- in China, and China's
biggest online search engine Baidu.com has been listing the Wikipedia content,
which goes under the free document license, as its own copyrighted material,
Wales said on the first day of the annual Wikimania 2007 which runs through
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Wales said he will visit China in September and meet with high-level government
officials there to address the blockage issue, but added that "there is no
formal expectation at this point."</P>
      <P>He said the Web site will not accept self-censorship in order to be unblocked in
China. In an earlier forum, he said Wikipedia will not allow censorship as Yahoo
and Google have done.</P>
      <P>Wikipedia is a wonderful, neutral educational resource and Chinese users should
be allowed to access it, he said.</P>
      <P>Unlike most intellectual property rights infringement cases, which can be talked
through and resolved with simple phone calls or email exchanges, the Baidu.com
case has been "something we've been aware of for a long time and is still
ongoing, " said Florence Devouard, chair of the Board of Trustees of the
Wikimedia Foundation.</P>
      <P>Although Baidu is a NASDAQ-listed company in the U.S., the foundation "has no
plan to do anything more aggressive" at the moment, Wales said.</P>
      <P>The three-day Wikimania 2007,  which was organized by the Wikimedia Foundation

      <P>The local chapter of the popular online reference Web site Wikipedia aims to
promote collaborative editing, knowledge sharing and the Web site in Taiwan, the
organizer of the chapter said Friday on the sidelines of an annual Wikimedia
conference.</P>
      <P>Wikimedia Taiwan was officially  approved by the Wikimedia Foundation,  a non-

Wikipedia, in July as one of the foundation's 10 local charters around the
world, Wikimedia Taiwan President Deng Chieh said.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese users have been one of the most active groups in generating Chinese-
language content on Wikipedia, a multilingual, Web-based, free content
encyclopedia project, Deng said.</P>
      <P>Wikimedia Taiwan plans to work with government agencies, academic institutions
and schools as more and more of them have expressed interest in the new way of
sharing free information, said Deng. The chapter will also be in charge of
redistribution of content, organizing small group meetings to improve Chinese
content, holding promotional events and trying to collect content directly from
institutions such as local museums and libraries.</P>
      <P>Wikipedia has become one of the most popular reference Web sites in Taiwan,
especially among students, Deng said.</P>
      <P>"The Web site traffic always peaks before final exams and dramatically hits
bottom during summer and winter vacations, " he pointed out.</P>
      <P>The current development of the Web site shows a lot of potential, he added, as
many local companies have inquired about using the free licensed content for
future development of commercial services.</P>
      <P>The Wikimedia Foundation has been working on establishing local charters in many
countries to foster better communication with locals and better content for
various languages, said Florence Devouard, chair of the Board of Trustees of the
Wikimedia Foundation.</P>
      <P>Wikimedia Taiwan was established in February 2007 and has more than 40 members,

official of the Tourism Bureau said Friday.</P>
      <P>Quoting bureau statistics released Thursday, the official said the average
occupancy rate of international tourist hotels was 67.03 percent, down 3.34
percent from the same period last year. Average occupancy rates of ordinary
tourist hotels was 59.87 percent, down 1.39 percent.</P>
      <P>The official said the summer peak travel season did not revive low hotel
occupancy rates, and some areas' average occupancy rates for July was as much as
50 percent below last year's figures.</P>
      <P>The average room rate for international tourist hotels was NT$3,422, an increase
of NT$159, and for ordinary tourist hotels, NT$2,224, up NT$23, the official
said.</P>
      <P>Average occupancy rates for tourist hotels in the Taichung area dropped by 14.76
percent. Among these, occupancy rates at international tourist hotels decreased
by 18.11 percent, while those of ordinary tourist hotels increased by 53.1
percent. Average room prices for the area's international hotels dropped by 3
percent, while those of ordinary hotels decreased by 25 percent, thereby
contributing to the increase in the occupancy rate, the official said.</P>
      <P>The Miramar Garden Taipei hotel had the highest occupancy rate in Taipei City,
at 91.64 percent, followed by the city's Cosmos Hotel and Kilin Hotel.</P>
      <P>The Monarch Plaza Hotel in Taoyuan County enjoyed the nation's highest occupancy

NT$1.22 billion, Sheraton Taipei Hotel, NT$1.12 billion, Far Eastern Plaza Hotel

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan plans lawsuit against ISO over name issue</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is mulling a plan to file a lawsuit against the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) for its erroneous designation of Taiwan
as a province of China, diplomatic sources said Friday.</P>
      <P>The lawsuit plan came after U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon recently rejected
President Chen Shui-bian's  letter expressing Taiwan's intention to apply for
U.N. membership under the name of Taiwan on the ground that Taiwan is part of
China.</P>
      <P>An increasing  number  of international  organizations  and enterprises have
also wrongly identified Taiwan as a province of China in recent years as they
refer to the ISO's codes for the representation  of names  of countries  and
their subdivisions (ISO-3166), the sources noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan  has long been negotiating  with the ISO over the designation issue but
has not received any positive response from the ISO, the sources said, adding
that the government has had to consider a legal battle as the last resort.</P>
      <P>ISO officials have pointed out that they did not coin the term but rather simply
follow the policy of the United Nations when it formulated ISO-3166 in 1974.</P>
      <P>Describing the ISO's use of "Taiwan, China" as an "infringement of Taiwan's name
right, " diplomatic officials predicted that Geneva courts will accept the
lawsuit, as the ISO is not an official international organization. But the
officials added that it remains uncertain when a lawsuit will be formally filed.</P>
      <P>The Geneva-based International Organization for Standardization (ISO)  is an
international  standard-setting  body composed of representatives from various
national standards bodies. Founded on Feb. 23, 1947, the organization produces
world-wide industrial and commercial standards.</P>
      <P>While the ISO defines itself as a non-governmental organization (NGO) , its
ability to set standards that often become law, either through treaties or
national standards, makes it more powerful than most NGOs. In practice, the ISO
acts as a consortium with strong links to governments. As of fall 2006, there
are 158 members, each of which represents one country.</P>

      <P>Taiwan remains the world's fourth-largest holder of foreign exchange reserves,
with the total recorded at the end of July amounting to US$266.29 billion,
according to statistics released Friday by Taiwan's central bank -- the Taipei-
based Central Bank of China.</P>
      <P>Bank officials pointed out that the total represents an increase of US$235
million from June, due mainly to interest accruing from existing foreign
exchange reserves and foreign money remitted into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>They noted that Taiwan has since May ranked fourth in the world in terms of
foreign exchange reserves, behind China, Japan and Russia.</P>
      <P>China's reserves stood at US$1.33 trillion at the end of June, followed by
Japan's US$892.8 billion and Russia's US$298.5 billion.</P>
      <P>Russia replaced Taiwan as the world's third-largest holder of foreign exchange
reserves in May when its total reached US$284.1 billion.</P>
      <P>Other statistics provided by the bank show that South Korea's reserves totaled
US$254.4 billion at the end of July, while Singapore and Hong Kong recorded
foreign exchange reserves totaling US$144.9 billion and US$130.9 billion in
June, respectively.</P>
      <P>Lin Sun-yuan, deputy director of the central bank's foreign exchange division,
said Taiwan's reserves are enough to supply Taiwan's needs through imports for
15.7 months.</P>
      <P>The amount is "appropriate, he said, adding that the world ranking means little.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu said Friday that no matter who holds the reins of the
Kaohsiung city government, the 2009 World Games to be held there will not be
affected by a lawsuit over the validity of her election as mayor.</P>
      <P>Chen made the pledge to Roh Froehlich,  chairman  of the International World
Games Association (IWGA) , who was in the southern port city at the head of a
delegation to inspect the preparations for the games.</P>
      <P>It was the second time Chen had made the assurances to Froehlich over the last
few days amid growing concern over the lawsuit against her that some feel might
hinder preparations for the games.</P>
      <P>Chen filed recently an appeal against a District Court ruling that annulled her
victory in last December's mayoral election on the grounds that she used
election gambits against her rival Huang Chun-ying of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) that could have affected the outcome of the election.</P>
      <P>Chen told Froehlich that she has great confidence in Chi Cheng, a Taiwanese
female athlete of the 1970s who serves as chief executive officer of the
Kaohsiung Organizing Committee, and her team that is organizing the games. Chen
said she also welcomes any suggestions from IWGA regarding the games.</P>
      <P>Describing Taiwan as a democratic country in which the judicial authorities will
make fair rulings on lawsuits, Chen assured the IWGA officials that the outcome
of her lawsuit will not affect the preparations for the games.</P>
      <P>It is the first time Taiwan has obtained the right to host the World Games, an
international multi-sports event organized by the IWGA under the patronage of

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei Prosecutors Office indicted the leader of an anti-corruption
movement against President  Chen Shui-bian Friday on charges of violations of
the Assembly and Parade Law.</P>
      <P>Shih Ming-teh, leader of the "Million Voices Against Corruption" campaign that
staged several massive protests to demand Chen's resignation over a spate of
scandals surrounding his family members and close aides last year, along with 15
other campaign officials, were named as co-defendants.</P>
      <P>The prosecution said Shih was not the only mastermind of the illicit assemblies
and that those who issued orders to the protesters and led the mob should also
be considered masterminds.</P>
      <P>The 15 officials include Legislator Shen Chih-huei of the opposition People
First Party, former legislators and leaders of civic groups Chien Hsih-chieh,
Cheng Lung-shui and Lin Cheng-chieh, and former Legislator and incumbent Taipei
city government cultural head Lee Yung-ping.</P>
      <P>Rounding off the list are political science professors Emile Sheng and Yao Li-
ming, Taipei Councilor Lee Hsin, former Taichung County Councilor Liu Kun-li,
KMT official Kuo Shu-chun, former ruling Democratic Progressive Party politician
Wang Li-ping, and Jerry Fan, who is famous for his innovative ideas in the
advertisement sector, as well as critics Wei Chien-feng, Chang Fu-chung and Lo
Shu-lei.</P>
      <P>All those named served as deputy leaders and spokesmen in the campaign,
according to the prosecution.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said in the indictment that Shih formed the "depose Chen" movement
Aug. 11, 2006 and decided in late September to stage a "siege" of the
Presidential Office on Double Ten National Day.</P>
      <P>On Oct. 10, 2006, Shih and the 15 officials mobilized tens of thousands of
protestors to encircle the Presidential Office and Chen's official residence in
an attempt to disrupt the National Day celebration activities.</P>
      <P>On Nov. 3, 2006, Shih and five others applied for an assembly at the square in
front of the Taipei Railway Station after first lady Wu Shu-jen was indicted on
charges of embezzling from a "state affairs fund" for the discretionary use of
her husband.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors said Shih and others then incited around 1,000 protestors  to
walk to Ketagalan  Boulevard  in front of the Presidential Office without
applying for permission. Police warned the crowd several times before dispersing
them.</P>
      <P>On Nov. 22, 2006, the lawful assembly time of the "depose Chen" protestors in
front of the Taipei Railway Station should have ended at 10 p.m., but Lin Cheng-
Chieh and others led the crowd in front of the station to a rented house nearby
that served as a provisional assembly place, although no application had been
made to rally there. Lin refused to disband the protestors after warnings from
the police, the prosecutors said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The organizer of an anti-corruption movement against President Chen Shui-bian
said Friday that he was "saddened" about being indicted.</P>
      <P>But Shih Ming-teh,  leader of the "Million Voices Against Corruption" campaign
that mobilized tens of thousands of people to stage several massive protests
against Chen over a spate of scandals surrounding his family members and close
aides last year, also said he hoped the court will give a speedy ruling and that
he will not appeal.</P>
      <P>Shih made the remarks after he and 15 others, including sitting and former
legislators, a Taipei city councilor, scholars and civic group leaders, were
indicted by the Taipei Prosecutors Office on charges of violating the Assembly
and the Parade law.</P>
      <P>Shih said that "a different time will give rise to a different viewpoint" and he
lamented that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) did not abolish the
outdated Assembly and Parade Law, but used it to indict him.</P>
      <P>Shih, a former DPP chairman who served long jail terms for advocating democracy
during Taiwan's infamous martial law era, claimed he has criticized and
monitored those in power "from the perspective of the people."</P>
      <P>He said that the presidents of the Republic of China, from Chiang Kai-shek
onwards, put him behind bars.</P>
      <P>"I thought President Chen would not do such a thing, but it seems he might," he
said.</P>
      <P>Shih, who has liver cancer, said that he hopes to "serve his due term in his
remaining days."</P>
      <P>He noted that the DPP, when it was an opposition party, had advocated the
repealing of the Assembly and Parade law, and that civic groups have also worked
hard to repeal the law, but the DPP, after seven years in power, still has yet
to repeal the "rogue" law and even uses it to act against the public.</P>
      <P>He also expressed disappointment toward the main opposition Kuomintang, which as
the largest party in the legislature, has not promoted the repealing of the
Assembly and Parade law and the formulation if other human rights bills.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Education Minister Tu Cheng-sheng was released Friday after being quizzed by
judicial personnel over a corruption scandal linked to the renovation of the
National Palace Museum's (NPM) main exhibition hall.</P>
      <P>Tu was questioned  as a witness because the controversial renovation project was
initiated and launched during his tenure as director of the suburban Taipei
museum between 2000 and 2004.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said the project's bidding process was suspected of having violated
the Government Procurement Law by allowing the winning bidder of a NT$2.5
million initial planning contract to secure a follow-up NT$13.3 million design,
supervision and service contract.</P>
      <P>"We need to determine whether Tu was aware of the bidding details because Shih
Shou-chien, who was Tu's deputy and later succeeded Tu as the museum's head,
claimed during a questioning session that the procurement case had been referred
to Tu for a final decision, " said a prosecutor responsible for investigating
the case.</P>
      <P>Tu was first questioned by agents from the Ministry of Justice Investigation
Bureau Friday afternoon, after which he was transferred to the Shihlin
Prosecutors Office for further interrogation. He was released at around 7:35
p.m.</P>
      <P>At issue was a NT$385 million museum renovation project that got underway in
July 2004 and was not fully completed until late last year.</P>
      <P>Suspecting possible irregularities in the bidding process after repeated cost
overruns, the prosecutors launched massive raids on the offices and residences
of architect Luo Hsing-hua  and other contractors in late May, collecting a
large number of files and documents in their searches.</P>
      <P>A number of former and incumbent museum officials and former Public Construction
Commission (PCC)  officials have also been arraigned over the case. The museum's
deputy curator, Lin Po-ting was held incommunicado in June for further
questioning. Several others, including Shih, were released on bail, with bail
amount ranging between NT$400,000 and NT$1 million.</P>
      <P>The museum and the PCC were suspected of favoring architect Lo Hsien-hua, who
won part of the renovation project for the main exhibition hall. Lo was released
on bail last month by Shihlin prosecutors.</P>
      <P>In February this year, the 42-year-old museum, which houses the best of the
1,000-year-old art collection of China's emperors, celebrated the reopening of
its full exhibition area after its renovation.</P>

      <P>Five of Taiwan's diplomatic allies have written to the United Nations to express
their objection to the world body's refusal to process Taiwan's application for
membership, Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Signed by the U.N. permanent representatives of Palau, Saint Vincent and the
Grenadines, the Solomon Islands, Swaziland and El Salvador, two letters were
delivered Aug. 3 to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Pascal Gayama,
rotating president of the U.N. Security Council for August.</P>
      <P>Also attached in the letter to Gayama was a copy of a membership application
letter sent to Ban by President Chen Shui-bian but returned.</P>
      <P>The U.N. ambassadors of the five diplomatic allies requested that Gayama
distribute Chen's letter to all members of the Security Council and take "proper
action" to deal with Taiwan's membership application.</P>
      <P>They accused the U.N. Secretariat of violating rules of procedure of the United
Nations and of infringing upon the authority of the Security Council by
returning Chen's letter without forwarding it to the Security Council for
review.</P>
      <P>In addition,  they  challenged  the validity  of the U.N. Secretariat's
rejection of Taiwan's application based on Resolution 2758, a document they
claim does not deny Taiwan's eligibility for membership.</P>
      <P>After the first letter was returned, the U.N. ambassadors of Swaziland and the
Solomon Islands delivered July 31 on behalf of Taiwan another letter signed by
Chen to Ban and one to Wang Guangya, China's permanent representative to the
United Nations, who served as rotating president of the Security Council for
July.</P>
      <P>While Wang returned the letter soon after receiving it, Ban, who is on a visit
to Haiti and Barbados, has not made an official response to Chen's second
letter.</P>
      <P>Asked about the matter Friday in New York, Farhan Haq, associate spokesman for
the secretary-general, said the second letter will also be returned.</P>
      <P>Haq said the position of the United Nations toward Taiwan's membership
application remains unchanged, which he reiterated is in line with Resolution
2758 and the "one China" policy of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The resolution was adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in 1971 recognizing the
representatives of the People's Republic of China government as "the only
legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations" and expelling
representatives of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China has tried without success to re-enter the United Nations
since 1993. This year marks the first time it has changed tactics by bidding to
join the world body under the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the latest letter to Ban, Chen asserted Taiwan's status as an independent
sovereign nation that is entitled to membership in the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Chen argued that U.N. Resolution 2758 neither grants China the right to
represent Taiwan at the United Nations nor states that Taiwan is either a part
of China or the People's Republic of China.</P>

said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection (BSMI) under the MOEA
published the information on its Web site www.bsmi.gov.tw after a spate of
complaints about unsafe Chinese products, ranging from food, toys with high
levels of heavy metals, toxic toothpaste, tainted medicine and pet food have
raised concerns around the world.</P>
      <P>To protect domestic consumers, the BSMI abridged some of the information
published by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission regarding China-made
unsafe products.</P>
      <P>The information includes the name of the product, the number of units produced,
the period when the goods were sold and where, the flaws and the potential
danger to consumers, courses of action for affected consumers and whether the
products are sold to Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei Prosecutors Office indicted the leader of an anti-corruption
movement against President  Chen Shui-bian Friday on charges of violations of
the Assembly and Parade Law.</P>
      <P>Shih Ming-teh, leader of the "Million Voices Against Corruption" campaign that
staged several massive protests to demand Chen's resignation over a spate of
scandals surrounding his family members and close aides last year, along with 15
other campaign officials, were named as co-defendants.</P>
      <P>The prosecution said Shih was not the only mastermind of the illicit assemblies
and that those who issued orders to the protesters and led the mob should also
be considered masterminds.</P>
      <P>The 15 officials include Legislator Shen Chih-huei of the opposition People
First Party, former legislators and leaders of civic groups Chien Hsih-chieh,
Cheng Lung-shui and Lin Cheng-chieh, and former Legislator and incumbent Taipei
city government cultural head Lee Yung-ping.</P>
      <P>Rounding off the list are political science professors Emile Sheng and Yao Li-
ming, Taipei Councilor Lee Hsin, former Taichung County Councilor Liu Kun-li,
KMT official Kuo Shu-chun, former ruling Democratic Progressive Party politician
Wang Li-ping, and Jerry Fan, who is famous for his innovative ideas in the
advertisement sector, as well as critics Wei Chien-feng, Chang Fu-chung and Lo
Shu-lei.</P>
      <P>All those named served as deputy leaders and spokesmen in the campaign,
according to the prosecution.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said in the indictment that Shih formed the "depose Chen" movement
Aug. 11, 2006 and decided in late September to stage a "siege" of the
Presidential Office on Double Ten National Day.</P>
      <P>On Oct. 10, 2006, Shih and the 15 officials mobilized tens of thousands of
protestors to encircle the Presidential Office and Chen's official residence in
an attempt to disrupt the National Day celebration activities.</P>
      <P>On Nov. 3, 2006, Shih and five others applied for an assembly at the square in
front of the Taipei Railway Station after first lady Wu Shu-jen was indicted on
charges of embezzling from a "state affairs fund" for the discretionary use of
her husband.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors said Shih and others then incited around 1,000 protestors  to
walk to Ketagalan  Boulevard  in front of the Presidential Office without
applying for permission. Police warned the crowd several times before dispersing
them.</P>
      <P>On Nov. 22, 2006, the lawful assembly time of the "depose Chen" protestors in
front of the Taipei Railway Station should have ended at 10 p.m., but Lin Cheng-
Chieh and others led the crowd in front of the station to a rented house nearby
that served as a provisional assembly place, although no application had been
made to rally there. Lin refused to disband the protestors after warnings from
the police, the prosecutors said.</P>

      <P>The organizer of an anti-corruption movement against President Chen Shui-bian
said Friday that he was "saddened" about being indicted.</P>
      <P>But Shih Ming-teh,  leader of the "Million Voices Against Corruption" campaign
that mobilized tens of thousands of people to stage several massive protests
against Chen over a spate of scandals surrounding his family members and close
aides last year, also said he hoped the court will give a speedy ruling and that
he will not appeal.</P>
      <P>Shih made the remarks after he and 15 others, including sitting and former
legislators, a Taipei city councilor, scholars and civic group leaders, were
indicted by the Taipei Prosecutors Office on charges of violating the Assembly
and the Parade law.</P>
      <P>Shih said that "a different time will give rise to a different viewpoint" and he
lamented that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) did not abolish the
outdated Assembly and Parade Law, but used it to indict him.</P>
      <P>Shih, a former DPP chairman who served long jail terms for advocating democracy
during Taiwan's infamous martial law era, claimed he has criticized and
monitored those in power "from the perspective of the people."</P>
      <P>He said that the presidents of the Republic of China, from Chiang Kai-shek
onwards, put him behind bars.</P>
      <P>"I thought President Chen would not do such a thing, but it seems he might," he
said.</P>
      <P>Shih, who has liver cancer, said that he hopes to "serve his due term in his
remaining days."</P>
      <P>He noted that the DPP, when it was an opposition party, had advocated the
repealing of the Assembly and Parade law, and that civic groups have also worked
hard to repeal the law, but the DPP, after seven years in power, still has yet
to repeal the "rogue" law and even uses it to act against the public.</P>
      <P>He also expressed disappointment toward the main opposition Kuomintang, which as
the largest party in the legislature, has not promoted the repealing of the
Assembly and Parade law and the formulation if other human rights bills.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Education Minister Tu Cheng-sheng was released Friday after being quizzed by
judicial personnel over a corruption scandal linked to the renovation of the
National Palace Museum's (NPM) main exhibition hall.</P>
      <P>Tu was questioned  as a witness because the controversial renovation project was
initiated and launched during his tenure as director of the suburban Taipei
museum between 2000 and 2004.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said the project's bidding process was suspected of having violated
the Government Procurement Law by allowing the winning bidder of a NT$2.5
million initial planning contract to secure a follow-up NT$13.3 million design,
supervision and service contract.</P>
      <P>"We need to determine whether Tu was aware of the bidding details because Shih
Shou-chien, who was Tu's deputy and later succeeded Tu as the museum's head,
claimed during a questioning session that the procurement case had been referred
to Tu for a final decision, " said a prosecutor responsible for investigating
the case.</P>
      <P>Tu was first questioned by agents from the Ministry of Justice Investigation
Bureau Friday afternoon, after which he was transferred to the Shihlin
Prosecutors Office for further interrogation. He was released at around 7:35
p.m.</P>
      <P>At issue was a NT$385 million museum renovation project that got underway in
July 2004 and was not fully completed until late last year.</P>
      <P>Suspecting possible irregularities in the bidding process after repeated cost
overruns, the prosecutors launched massive raids on the offices and residences
of architect Luo Hsing-hua  and other contractors in late May, collecting a
large number of files and documents in their searches.</P>
      <P>A number of former and incumbent museum officials and former Public Construction
Commission (PCC)  officials have also been arraigned over the case. The museum's
deputy curator, Lin Po-ting was held incommunicado in June for further
questioning. Several others, including Shih, were released on bail, with bail
amount ranging between NT$400,000 and NT$1 million.</P>
      <P>The museum and the PCC were suspected of favoring architect Lo Hsien-hua, who
won part of the renovation project for the main exhibition hall. Lo was released
on bail last month by Shihlin prosecutors.</P>
      <P>In February this year, the 42-year-old museum, which houses the best of the
1,000-year-old art collection of China's emperors, celebrated the reopening of
its full exhibition area after its renovation.</P>

      <P>A U.S.-based pro-independence Taiwanese expatriate group voiced strong protest
Friday against U.N. Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon's decision not to process
Taiwan's application for membership in the organization under the name of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a letter addressed to Ban, Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA)
President C.T. Lee rejected Ban's argument that the United Nations takes the
position that "Taiwan is part of China" under Resolution 2758 adopted by the
U.N. General Assembly in 1971.</P>
      <P>"This is contrary to the facts: If you read Resolution 2758 carefully, you will
see that it does not even mention Taiwan, " Lee said.</P>
      <P>Under the resolution, the United Nations decided to recognize the
representatives of the People's Republic of China as the only legitimate
representatives of China to the United Nations and "to expel forthwith the
representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from the place which they unlawfully occupy
at the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it."</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the issue addressed in the resolution was "which government
represented China " and it is wrong to equate the "representatives of Chiang
Kai-shek" with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Chiang and his representatives were not expelled in 1971 because they
represented Taiwan. They were expelled because they claimed to represent China,"
Lee noted.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's status, Lee referred Ban to the San Francisco Peace Treaty of
1951-52, in which Japan formally ceded sovereignty over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that delegates at the San Francisco conference concurred that
the status of Taiwan needed to be determined "in due time, in accord with the
purposes and principles as laid down in the Charter of the United Nations."</P>
      <P>Urging Ban to reconsider his position on Taiwan's application, Lee said Taiwan
is a democratic nation that fulfills all the criteria for a nation-state as
defined in the 1933 Montevideo Convention: a defined territory, a permanent
population and a government capable of entering into diplomatic relations with
other states.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian sent a membership application letter to Ban July 19,
but the letter was returned by Ban July 23 based on Resolution 2758, which U.N.
officials said is the basis of the "one China" policy of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Chen sent another letter to Ban July 31 urging him to reconsider his decision.
Ban, who is on a visit to Haiti and Barbados, has not made an official response
to Chen's second letter, although Farhan Haq, associate spokesman for the
secretary-general, said Friday that the second letter will also be returned and
that the U.N. position remains unchanged.</P>

      <P>Amid growing concerns about a banned veterinary drug used on pigs, the
Department of Health (DOH) said Saturday that local health officials have
collected 40 samples of pig innards from traditional markets and that test
results are due by the end of the month.</P>
      <P>Two shipments of imported U.S. pork were recently found to contain ractopamine
hydrochloride, known by the brand name paylean, prompting the Bureau of Food
Safety under the DOH to instruct local health officials July 20 to collect pork
samples for testing.</P>
      <P>The DOH demanded a further 40 samples of pig innards July 31.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Food and Drug Analysis under the DOH completed tests on the first
43 samples and announced a day earlier that three of them contained paylean.</P>
      <P>Cheng Huei-wen, director-general of the DOH Bureau of Food Safety, said the
residual levels of paylean in the three samples were relatively small and that
the public need not be alarmed.</P>
      <P>Paylean is listed by the Council of Agriculture as a banned veterinary drug, but
it is allowed in the United States and some other countries.</P>
      <P>Cheng also said that if paylean is used during the growing period of pigs,
residue of the banned drug in pig innards would be many times higher than that
otherwise found in pork.</P>
      <P>But as innards usually require more elaborate processing before testing, the
results will not be known until the end of the month, Cheng said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has won its bid to host the 2010 forum of the International University
Sports Federation (FISU) , a Sports Affairs Council (SAC) official said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>It is being considered by the Taiwanese authorities as "yet another score" in

      <P>According to SAC Vice Chairman Lee Kao-hsiang, the FISU Forum is a biennial
event held alternately with the universiade, and Taiwan made a bid to host the
forum in a low-profile manner in light of China's isolation of the country in
the international arena.</P>
      <P>Lee said the sports park under construction in Kaohsiung City in preparation for

      <P>The nation's top economic policy charting body suggested Saturday that Taiwan
learn from the experience of Japan and stimulate regional industry in a bid to
bridge the wealth gap between urban and rural areas.</P>
      <P>Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) officials said that on a
scale of one to five in terms of national income, Taiwan's highest income group
earns 6.04-fold that of the lowest income group on average, which it said is
lower than the figures in the United States, Hong Kong and South Korea.</P>
      <P>Figures released by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
show that the highest income group in Singapore earns 20.91-fold the lowest
income group on average, compared to 17.66-fold in Hong Kong, 9.6-fold in the
United States, 7.21-fold in Great Britain and 6.84-fold in South Korea.</P>
      <P>But Taiwan's figure is still high compared to the 4.98-fold in Japan, 4.02-fold
in Sweden, 3.88-fold in Norway and 3.82-fold in Finland, the officials said.</P>
      <P>They noted that Japan, in a bid to narrow the gap between rich and poor, has
continued to promote balanced development of rural and urban areas in recent
years and has achieved substantial results.</P>
      <P>In Japan,  top-notch universities,  research institutes and business groups that
are capable of creating new industry work together to form an emerging industry
cluster, they said.</P>
      <P>Stimulation policies initiated by Japanese local governments stress local
agricultural products, business features and tourism, which are combined with
local history and culture to establish regional brands, they added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, they went on, has promoted stepped-up efforts to promote economic
development in central and southern Taiwan and to care for lower income groups.</P>
      <P>The CEPD also hopes to develop local industry with the aim of developing one
feature industry for each township under its "mega investment, mega warmth"
project.</P>
      <P>The CEPD hopes that the wealth gap can be reduced to below six-fold by 2015, the
officials added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>"I have been seeking, seeking a window opened by God that can lead to a
promising future for farmers, and seeking a pathway that can offer a hope for
disadvantaged children."</P>
      <P>This is a passage from a book titled "Rice is Not a Bomb " written in a semi-
autobiographical style by Yang Ju-men, better known locally as the "rice
bomber."</P>
      <P>The book includes more than 100 letters written by Yang to Wu Ying-ning, a
freelancer based in the central county of Changhua, during his incarceration.
Yang details in the letters his simple but very strong motivation behind his
year-long bombing campaign that led to his imprisonment.</P>
      <P>The book also includes two letters written by Yang to society and friends,
respectively, following his release from jail with President Chen Shui-bian
granting him a pardon June 21. In those two letters, Yang calls for more care
for the disadvantaged, particularly farmers and children, and expressed his
heartfelt gratitude for those who had repeatedly appealed for his pardon in the
past few years.</P>
      <P>Yang was sentenced in 2005 to seven-and-a-half years in prison plus a fine of
NT$100,000 (US$3,030.3) for planting 17 explosive devices in public places
around Taipei over a one-year period until he turned himself in Nov. 26, 2004.</P>
      <P>Identifying himself as an opponent of the government's rice import policy, Yang
always sprinkled small amounts of rice in his homemade explosives, which is
where his nickname came from. Nobody was injured in his year-long bombing
campaign, although he struck fear and terror into the hearts of the public.</P>
      <P>"What kind of social structure do we have that has made elderly farmers' desires
to lead a peaceful life in their rural towns in the company of their children
and grandchildren become a luxury and impossible dream?" Yang asks in the book.</P>
      <P>Growing up in a Changhua farming community, Yang said he has witnessed the
decline of agriculture in rural Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I feel deep emotional affinity with rural elders who are living below the
subsistence level after imported rice and other produce eroded the market share
of locally grown crops, " Yang writes. "It is against this backdrop that I had
to resort to means available to a disadvantaged individual like me to express
the grievances of farmers."</P>
      <P>Yang also writes in the new book that he once met a teenage boy selling coconuts
on a street in the eastern city of Hualien with a schoolbag on his back when he
was on a round-the-island cycling tour.</P>
      <P>"I stopped cycling and asked him whether he would mind eating a meal with me.
The young boy told me that he had to choose between going to school or making a
living. The encounter let me see clearly the predicament of those living at the
bottom of society, " Yang writes, adding that the boy later died at his home as
he could not afford to see a doctor.</P>
      <P>The episode firmed up his determination to stand up for farmers and the
disadvantaged, Yang writes.</P>
      <P>Admitting that he has little knowledge of agriculture, Yang writes that he
vividly remembers whole crops of watermelons and carrots being given away
because they could not fetch a reasonable price. A small truckload of cabbage
was often sold for less than NT$500, he writes, adding that it was not uncommon
for many grape vines to be chopped down when farmers associations or wholesale
dealers stopped buying the fruit.</P>
      <P>"What I did was purely aimed at helping farmers and children. It is my humble
hope that farmers can make a living on their own land and receive due respect,
while children can go to school and eat their fill without losing dignity, "
Yang writes.</P>
      <P>To him, Yang writes, the sentence handed down to him by the judiciary for his
terrorist acts was tantamount to a "punishment for the disadvantaged."</P>
      <P>"The prison  sentence  to me was like a penalty  to the underprivileged. It
seems to forbid me from speaking for the disadvantaged any more, " Yang says.</P>
      <P>But he added that he was convinced that the longer the prison term, the better
for his cause.</P>
      <P>"As a matter of fact, I looked forward to getting the death sentence. I was not
mad... For me, the sentence was a symbol of political suppression. I believe
that the stronger the suppression, the stronger the backlash and the
breakthrough," Yang writes.</P>
      <P>Yang further said he originally would not appeal his case after getting a seven-
and-a-half-year sentence in the first instance.</P>
      <P>"But I changed my mind after reading the verdict, which stated that I had made
the explosive devices for my own criminal purposes. Such a judgment completely
denied my pursuit of justice for farmers and disadvantaged children. My
motivation was to call for care for the disadvantaged and I tried my best to
avoid hurting any individual in my campaign," Yang writes.</P>
      <P>He appealed his case as a protest and his sentence was reduced to five years in
prison in the second trial.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu visited a Japanese electronic firm Saturday located in
the city of Hachioji, a Tokyo satellite,  and was "deeply impressed" by
Hachioji's high-tech development.</P>
      <P>Chen, who arrived in Japan Friday, was there to boost relations with the city of
Hachioji, which established sisterhood ties with Kaohsiung last November.</P>
      <P>According to Yamanishi Co. Vice President Hisashi Kinoshita, the city of
Hachioji has become a high-tech industrial base thanks to its good-quality water
and its geographic proximity to Tokyo.</P>
      <P>Kinoshita also noted that many of the chips in the cell phones developed by
Yamanishi come from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that she has been promoting an industrial upgrade in Kaohsiung to
transform it from a heavy-industry metropolis in southern Taiwan that emits huge
quantities of carbon dioxide to a city focused on high-tech and trade
industries.</P>
      <P>Chen hailed Hachioji's transformation from a city of contract manufacturers to
one now focused on research and development, expressing hope that Kaohsiung
follow suit.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kinoshita said he was quite impressed by Kaohsiung's development and
considers it a city full of potential, especially after the convenience brought
by Taiwan's high-speed rail system that reduces significantly the travel time
between the north and the south of Taiwan. He added that a Hachioji delegation
composed of small- and medium-sized enterprise representatives will visit
Kaohsiung next year to gain a better understanding of the city's investment
environment.</P>
      <P>Chen, who was traveling at the head of a 39-member delegation of city government
officials, noted that Kaohsiung City hopes to strengthen exchanges with the city
of Hachioji -- the 23rd city to establish sisterhood ties with Kaohsiung -- in
various fields, including economic, trade, cultural and municipal
administration.</P>
      <P>She is also expected to take advantage of her Japan visit to tout the 2009 World
Games to be held in the southern port city.</P>
      <P>The delegation is scheduled to leave Tokyo for home Aug. 8.</P>

      <P>The government has made remarkable headway in cracking down corruption "black
gold" politics during the last seven years, indicting more than 10,000 people
accused of embezzling a total of NT$31.76 billion (US$968 million) , Ministry of
Justice (MOJ) officials said Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to MOJ statistics, of the 10,221 people indicted by prosecutors during
the last seven years, 573 were high-ranking civil servants, 602 were lawmakers
and councilors, 1,832 were middle-level civil servants, 3,021 were low-echelon
government officials and 4,193 were members of the public.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that ever since the action plan for wiping out corruption
was implemented in June 2000 soon after President Chen Shui-bian assumed the
presidency, the number of indictment cases related to corruption dropped from
4,102 registered in the period 1993-2000 to 3,934 in the period 2000-2007, while

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has issued a strong protest against the
rejection of President Chen Shui-bian's letter requesting Taiwan's U.N.
membership by China's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Wang
Guangya.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Wang Chien-yeh said Friday Chen's letter applying for U.N.
membership under the name of Taiwan was delivered July 31 to Wang Guangya, who
served as rotating president of the U.N. Security Council for July, through the
U.N. representatives of Swaziland and the Solomon Islands, two of Taiwan's
diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>However, Wang Guangya returned immediately Chen's letter the same day, arguing
that Resolution 2758 adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in 1971 recognizes the
representatives of the People's Republic of China government as the "only
legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations, " and that China's
representation in the U.N. "naturally" includes Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang Chien-yeh said Wang Guangya's remarks are unacceptable to Taiwan as it will
mislead the world community and sacrifice the basic human rights of Taiwan's 23
million people.</P>
      <P>He added that only the U.N. Security Council and General Assembly have the right
to screen and decide membership applications, which is why Chen sent Wang
Guangya the letter after a letter sent to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon
earlier in July was rejected, with Ban noting that U.N. membership is only
granted to sovereign countries and that the U.N. considers Taiwan to be "part of
China."</P>
      <P>Wang Guangya failed to do his job by not delivering Chen's letter to the U.N.
Security Council for screening, Wang Chien-yeh added.</P>
      <P>He further noted that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have been governed by
separate governments for the last six decades and that Resolution 2758 does not
mention Taiwan, neither does it give the People's Republic of China the right to
represent the people of Taiwan in the U.N.</P>
      <P>China has "wrongly interpreted" Resolution 2758 and has tried to create a false
"one China" concept around the world, to which the Taiwan government expresses
its strongest protest, Wang Chien-yeh said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Project 'moulin' to help unconnected world with offline Wikipedia</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>As most people are happy surfing Wikipedia, one of the most popular online
reference Web sites, some people have been trying to deliver an "offline
Wikipedia" to the developing countries and the "unconnected part of the world".
One of them is French programmer Renaud Gaudin, who is working for the purpose
under a project named "moulin."</P>
      <P>The "moulin, " which means windmill in French, attempts to improve the access to
basic information and reference material in developing countries by making it
possible to access Wikipedia offline, said Gaudin Saturday in a seminar of
Wikimania 2007, an annual Wikimedia conference which is being held in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"Basically, moulin is a fully interactive, offline version of the entire
Wikipedia, without pictures, on a CD, " said the French programmer  who based
in West  African  country  Mali as an non-government organization volunteer.</P>
      <P>The project is the brainchild of Gaudin and Frederic Renet, who realized that
while many organizations focused on bringing computer to people in developing
countries, few have paid attention to making content available for people in
those places that do not have access to the Internet.</P>
      <P>"Wikipedia has been also developing a project called 'Wikipedia on DVD', a CD
collection of around 2,000 Wikipedia articles, but we want to do more than that.
We wanted to have the full Wikipedia in the CD because people in Africa don't
know about too many things, " said Gaudin.</P>
      <P>The current French version moulin contains  around 450,000 Wikipedia articles,
he said.</P>
      <P>Moulin started off as a side project of Geekcorps Mali, an NGO Gaudin worked
for. The initial prototype of the system ran on Nokia 770, a portable internet
tablet. Gaudin later rewrote the software and developed the current version of
moulin which can be run off a CD before volunteering for his second tour to
Mali.</P>
      <P>Gaudin, who is now developing the software on his own with several friends
volunteering in developing the software in different languages, said he talked
to organizations and projects, such as OLPC (One Laptop Per Child), for
collaboration.</P>
      <P>"OLPC said it would develop a system of its own since the project targeted for
children and did not need the whole Wikipedia, " he said.</P>
      <P>The biggest problem for Gaudin right now is the lack of distribution power and
funding, although it did receive funding from USAID. Without enough money, it's
difficlut to distribute the French version CDs across West Africa, he said.</P>
      <P>Gaudin,  who visits Taiwan for the first time,  is still optimistic, saying he
plans to develop the pocket device version of moulin and set up a distribution
network in Africa. He also looks forward to collaborating with people in other
countries.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Markets Fall as Lender Woes Keep Mounting

Stocks tumbled yesterday on fears that the worsening ills in the mortgage and
debt markets could soon take a significant toll on consumers, businesses and the
overall economy.

The latest decline capped a volatile two weeks on Wall Street in which the stock
market has swung wildly from day to day, reflecting rising uncertainty about the
outlook for markets and the risks plaguing the economy. The biggest moves lately
have often occurred shortly before trading closed.

Wall Street Journal:The Secrets of the World's Richest Man

Carlos Slim is Mexico's Mr. Monopoly.

It's hard to spend a day in Mexico and not put money in his pocket. The 67-year-
old tycoon controls more than 200 companies -- he says he's "lost count" -- in
telecommunications, cigarettes, construction, mining, bicycles, soft-drinks,
airlines, hotels, railways, banking and printing.

In all, his companies account for more than a third of the total value of
Mexico's leading stock market index, while his fortune represents 7% of the

      <P>Offenses against the veterinary drugs management act will be subject to harsher
penalties after proposed amendments to the law are approved by the legislature,
an animal health official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Yeh Ying, deputy director of the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection
and Quarantine (BAPHIQ) under the Council of Agriculture (COA) , made the
remarks amid growing concern about a banned veterinary drug, ractopamine
hydrochloride, recently found in two shipments of imported U.S. pork and some
samples of locally produced pork and goose meat.</P>
      <P>The issue has drawn even more attention after law enforcement officers seized a
large amount of raw materials used for production of ractopamine hydrochloride,
known by the brand name paylean, in raids around Taiwan in the past couple of
days.</P>
      <P>Yeh said even though paylean is allowed in the United States and some other
countries for use as a food addictive to boost growth of lean meat in pigs, the
COA has no plan to lift the ban on the drug at the moment.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Yeh said the BAPHIQ has tightened law enforcement to deter offenses
against the ban. Starting July 1, the bureau has required local livestock and
poultry inspectors to conduct hair tests for residue of the banned drug.</P>
      <P>In addition to cooperating with prosecution authorities in the recent raids on
upperstream raw materials importers and paylean manufacturers, the bureau has
also asked local courts to adopt a stricter attitude toward relevant offenses,
including use, importing, manufacturing and marketing.</P>
      <P>Under the current regulations, those who illegally use paylean to feed pigs or
poultry will be slapped with fines ranging between NT$6,000 and NT$30,000.</P>
      <P>According to the BAPHIQ-drafted package of amendments to the law, the fine for
paylean users will be raised to a tune of NT$30,000 to NT$150,000; the prison
term for importers and manufacturers of the banned drug will be raised from the
current "no more than three years" to "between three years and seven years plus
a fine of NT$900,000"; and the penalty for dealers or distributors will be
raised from the current "a maximum of two years to a maximum of three years plus
a fine of NT$900,000."</P>
      <P>Yeh said the draft amendments will be referred to the Legislative Yuan for
approval during the new legislative session scheduled to open next month.</P>

      <P>In addition to cooperating with prosecution authorities in the recent raids on
upperstream raw materials importers and paylean manufacturers, the bureau has
also asked local courts to adopt a stricter attitude toward relevant offenses,
including use, importing, manufacturing and marketing.</P>
      <P>Under the current regulations, those who illegally use paylean to feed pigs or
poultry will be slapped with fines ranging between NT$6,000 and NT$30,000.</P>

current "no more than three years" to "between three years and seven years plus
a fine of NT$900,000"; and the penalty for dealers or distributors will be
raised from the current "a maximum of two years to a maximum of three years plus
a fine of NT$900,000."</P>

      <P>The Chunghwa Telecom Workers' Union (CTWU) may team up with other industrial
workers unions across the country to organize a new political party and field
its own candidates in the next legislative election, CTWU Chairman Chang Hsu-
chung said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chang said the CTWU board of directors held a meeting recently, during which it
was resolved that he be appointed to organize a new political party representing
members of all workers' unions around the country, including teachers unions, so
that these group of people might be represented independently in the
legislature.</P>
      <P>Noting that the country's workers groups have been dependent on other political
parties when it comes to efforts to fight for their rights and interests, Chang
said that by organizing their own party, the workers will have a better means to
advance their causes.</P>
      <P>Funding to the tune of NT$10 million has already been secured, enough for the
soon-to-be-organized party to field 10 of its members in the next legislative
election slated for Jan. 12, 2008, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, members of national federations of different industries from
around the island, as well as the CTWU and the Formosa Plastics Workers' Union
met July 19 for a preparatory meeting for the establishment of a Workers
Solidarity Union.</P>
      <P>Representatives of these groups of people are expected to meet again Aug. 21,
when the "Workers Solidarity Union" might be formally established, according to
Chang.</P>
      <P>Once the "Workers Solidarity Union" is established, it will launch campaigns to
push for a nationwide referendum on a workers' version of the annuity policy,
instead of an Executive Yuan's annuity policy; a referendum on the ban on
dispatch workers; and guarantees stabilizing employment opportunities, Chang
said.</P>
      <P>Chang added that it is still too early to speculate on whether the name of the
political party that the workers groups are poised to form would be called the
Workers Solidarity Union Party. The party could also have a name called the
Third Force Reform Union or something else, he said.</P>
      <P>In light of the fact that there are 8.6 million workers in Taiwan, political
analysts said the prospective workers party could be a political force to be
reckoned with if it wins their support. some around the country.</P>

Pony Baseball Bronco League World Series being contested among eight teams in
Monterey, California.</P>

School in Taipei County, is competing in the series under the name "Chinese
Taipei." The championship tournament is being played Aug. 2-7 in the Jacks

      <P>On Aug. 2, the opening day of the series, the Taiwanese boys trounced the
Stratford team of Connecticut -- the winning team of America's East Zone --
running up a score of 15: 3, including eight runs in the first inning. The game
was terminated at the end of the fifth inning when the Taiwan team's lead

      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) has imposed a temporary ban on
imports of meats and related products from Britain Saturday after the British
government announced earlier that day an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease
(FMD) on a farm in southern England, a COA official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Sung Hua-tsung, director of the COA Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection
and Quarantine, said that the COA imposed the ban on pork, mutton and beef
imports from the United Kingdom soon after the British government's
announcement.</P>
      <P>Sung noted, however, that the ban would have little impact on meat supplies in
the domestic market since British pork, mutton and beef products constitute only
a tiny fraction of Taiwan's total meat imports.</P>
      <P>As of Sunday noon, major countries, including the United States, Japan and
Singapore, have all announced bans on imports of such products from the United
Kingdom.</P>
      <P>FMD, which can travel on the wind as well as farm equipment, causes high fevers
and blisters in cloven-hoofed animals and often leads to death. It is very
rarely transferred to humans.</P>
      <P>This is the first FMD outbreak reported in the United Kingdom since 2001.</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire news reports, British authorities have set up a 3-km
radius exclusion zone and a wider 10 km surveillance area around the infected
farm in the county of Surrey. Within that area is a laboratory used by the
British Institute for Animal Health to test foot-and-mouth samples.</P>
      <P>While the laboratory has not been fingered as the outbreak's source, this strain
of FMD has been identified as similar to that isolated in a 1967 outbreak, and
used in vaccine production and diagnostics.</P>
      <P>Movement of all pigs, sheep and cattle in the United Kingdom has reportedly been
banned as a further precautionary measure.</P>

      <P>Tropical storm Pabuk -- the fifth named storm in the Western Pacific this year

      <P>The center of the storm is expected to be located at 660 km southeast of the
Ryukyu Islands around 2 p.m. Monday.</P>
      <P>CWB meteorologists said Pabuk has a 100 km-radius and is packing winds of 18
meters per second, or 65 kph, with gusts reaching 25 meters per second.</P>
      <P>If the tropical storm maintains its present course and speed, it will make a
landfall in Taiwan Aug. 8.</P>
      <P>According to the CWB forecast, another tropical depression formed near the
Spratlys and is moving slowly toward waters east of Vietnam. Because its
location is close to a landmass, its strength will be limited even if it
develops into a tropical storm.</P>
      <P>The forecast also said that regions of western Taiwan will likely see
thunderstorms and showers over the next two to five days, mainly due to the
effects of a receding ridge of high pressure in the Pacific.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese patriots should try to understand the country because true confidence
emerges from a robust knowledge of its capacity and the people's vitality, the
ruling party's presidential candidate said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Frank Hsieh, the Democratic Progressive Party's standard bearer in the 2008
presidential election, made the remarks as he concluded the first stop of a
nationwide campaign tour, dubbed the "New Six Stars Plan."</P>
      <P>Hsieh started his tour in the eastern county of Hualien Thursday, with plans to
stay for three days at each stop, visiting local industries and meeting
grassroots supporters.</P>
      <P>After three days of touring local communities, Hsieh said he has come to a
deeper understanding of Taiwan's strength.</P>
      <P>"Every time when I visit a local community, I see the strength and vigor of our
people and come to know many heartwarming real-life stories.  The tour has
afforded me a valuable opportunity to understand Hualien's unique features and
merits and further enhance my confidence in Taiwan's future," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>On the last day of his visit in Hualien, Hsieh toured the Lintienshan Culture
Museum and a forest railway in addition to inspecting a railway bridge
reconstruction project in the county's Yuli township.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the development of eastern Taiwan should not follow the mode adopted
in the western part of the country because the two areas have different
resources. For instance, eastern Taiwan is rich in maritime and tourist
resources that deserve further exploration with eco-friendly ways.</P>
      <P>Noting that the "New Six Stars Plan" is aimed at transforming Taiwan into a
globally competitive country, Hsieh said that under the plan, Taiwan can be
divided into six regions, with each region comparable to Singapore in scale and
size. According to Hsieh's plan, each region should cooperate with the others
and allow mutual use of their resources in order to sharpen their competitive
edge.</P>
      <P>Hsieh returned to Taipei Saturday evening to attend a campaign rally of
Legislator Huang Shih-cho of the Taiwan Solidarity Union, who is seeking re-
election next January.</P>
      <P>Hsieh will continue his "New Six Stars Plan" campaign tour next week, with
visits to Taitung in eastern Taiwan and the northeastern county of Yilan.</P>
      <P>When Hsieh was premier in 2005, he also promoted a "Six Stars Plan," with the
"six stars" referring to developing local businesses, improving social welfare
and medical system, promoting cultural and educational development, maintaining
public safety, protecting the environment and preserving natural scenery.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian did not confirm a local newspaper's report Sunday that
Beijing has vetoed his choice of former Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen as Taiwan's
envoy to the informal summit of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum, slated for September 8-9 in Sydney, Australia.</P>
      <P>In a response to journalists questions while attending a lunch party with
friends at Shezi, in Taipei City, the president said that if the report carried
on Sunday's China Times is true, it only confirms his administration's claims
that Beijing will spare no efforts in its attempts to isolate Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen added that Beijing's interference is constant, regardless of the political
affiliation or gender of Taiwanese political figures.</P>
      <P>Without confirming that he had chosen Tsai as his envoy to the APEC Economic
Leaders Meeting, the president said he will not yield to China's pressure, but
continue to fight to defend the Taiwan's interests.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Cho Jung-tai,  acting secretary-general  of the Presidential Office
said the president is still searching for a proper envoy to act on his behalf at
the APEC summit, and will reveal his decision before Aug. 20, adding that
Beijing's opinion won't be a factor in his decision.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is a member of the APEC, due to Beijing's opposition, no
president has ever attended the summit since its inception in 1993. Instead, the
country has sent an envoy in place of its president to the summits.</P>
      <P>Last year the president appointed Morris Chang, chairman of the Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, as his envoy to the summit hosted by
Vietnam in its capital, Hanoi.</P>
      <P>In a front page story, the China Times cited anonymous sources as saying that
Tsai has been chosen as the envoy this year by the president, but has been
rejected by Beijing on the grounds that she was one of the advisors who help
former President Lee Teng-hui characterize Taiwan's ties with China as "a
special state-to-state relationship," in 1999.</P>
      <P>Angered by Lee's claims, Beijing has put a halt on all dialogue with Taiwan ever

      <P>In the Internet age, the idea of a "sharing economy" will impact the traditional
market economy and a group of amateurs will be able to do phenomenonal things by
collaborating with one another, a Japanese internet entrepreneur said on the
final day of the Wikimania 2007 international conference.</P>
      <P>"The market economy basically tells people to make as much money as possible,
but not everything evolves around making money, " Joichi Ito, a Japanese-born,
American-educated activist, entrepreneur and venture capitalist, told around 400
participants of the annual Wikimedia conference.</P>
      <P>The evolution of the Internet has changed the ways people live as well as their
perspectives, he said, pointing out that the importance of "happiness, which
comes from compassion of giving and receiving, " instead of money, matters more
to people nowadays.</P>
      <P>The online encyclopedia Wikipedia, a collaboration by a community of so-called
amateur contributors all over the world, is a good example, he said. It provides
for the needs of some, who have no current means with which to reciprocate: a
characteristic of a sharing economy.</P>
      <P>As much as everyone likes to share good things with others, it has also given
rise to the piracy issue, and despite efforts to stamp it out, illegal
reproduction and downloads still exist.</P>
      <P>Commercial companies should learn to view things from a different perspective in
the light of an ethic of sharing, Ito claimed. For example, he said, a video
remix about politics using various television news clips should be considered a
"new means of practicing free speech."</P>
      <P>Ito, chairman of the board of Creative Commons (CC), also talked about new forms
of copyright that the non-profit organization advocates.</P>
      <P>"You give away some rights while still remaining the copyright holder, "he said.</P>
      <P>CC is devoted to expanding the range of creative work available for others to
legally build upon and share. It has released several copyright  licenses  known
as Creative Commons licenses which, depending on the one chosen, restrict only
certain rights (or none) of the work.</P>
      <P>CC and Wikimedia are both part of the Free Culture movement, a social movement
that calls for the freedom to use the Internet and other media to distribute and

      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Sunday that his primary concern now
is how to help the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) win the legislative and

      <P>Wang made the remarks during a trip to Changhua County in central Taiwan to take

      <P>Asked by reporters to comment on news reports that he could lose his status as
the legislative speaker in 2008 because the KMT might not invite him to be its
No. 1 legislator-at-large, Wang said he would not pay much attention to such
reports, because he only has the KMT and the state in mind.</P>
      <P>He said his foremost concern at present is to do his utmost to help the party

be a "positive thing" if Wang can continue to serve as Legislative Yuan speaker
next year.</P>
      <P>Wang declined to be Ma's running mate after Ma became the KMT's presidential
nominee in early May. The two political heavyweights were bitter rivals in the
2005 KMT chairmanship election and the process to name the party's presidential
candidate.</P>
      <P>However, after Ma invited Vincent Siew, a former premier from 1997 to 2000 when

the country under the name of Taiwan, Chen told the seminar that Beijing's
attempts to isolate Taiwan won't stop even if Taiwan leans over backward to
refrain from offending China.</P>
      <P>In order to support his claim that Beijing's interference is constant,
regardless of the political affiliation or gender of Taiwan's political leaders,
Chen said for the first time that Beijing has vetoed Taiwan's decision to have a
woman envoy to the APEC Economic Leaders Meeting this year.</P>
      <P>Although he didn't mention the woman envoy's name, it was the closet remarks he
have ever made to a confirmation of the local newspaper China Time's story that
Beijing has rejected Chen's choice of former Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen as his
envoy to the meeting.</P>
      <P>In a front page story, the paper cited anonymous national security officials as
saying that Beijing rejected Tsai on the grounds that she was one of the
advisors who help former President Lee Teng-hui characterize Taiwan's ties with
China as "a special state-to-state relationship," in 1999.</P>
      <P>Angered by Lee's claims, Beijing has put a halt on all dialogue with Taiwan ever
since.</P>
      <P>Asking by journalists for comments, the president said in Shezi, Taipei City
earlier the day that "if" the China Times' report is true, it only confirms his
administration's claims that Beijing will spare no efforts in its attempts to
isolate Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Instead of admitting what would be a diplomatic setback for Taipei, the
president said at that time that he will not yield to China's pressure, but
continue to fight to defend the Taiwan's interests.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Cho Jung-tai,  acting secretary-general  of the Presidential Office
said the president is still searching for a proper envoy to act on his behalf at
the APEC summit, and will reveal his decision before Aug. 20, adding that
Beijing's opinion won't be a factor in his decision.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is a member of the APEC, due to Beijing's opposition, no
president has ever attended the summit since its inception in 1993. Instead, the
country has sent an envoy in place of its president to the summits.</P>
      <P>Last year the president appointed Morris Chang, chairman of the Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, as his envoy to the summit hosted by
Vietnam in its capital, Hanoi.</P>

      <P>Taiwan owes its democracy to the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan, President Chen
Shui-bian said Sunday.</P>
      <P>In a gathering organized by the church in Taipei to mark the 30th anniversary of
its issuance of a human right declaration in which it called for Taiwan's
independence, Chen lauded the church leaders' courage to speak for justice and
truth when the island was under the Kuomintang's authoritarian rule.</P>
      <P>The Presbyterian Church leaders' advocacy for better human rights protection and
democracy has inspired the people on the island to fight for freedom and
democracy, the president said.</P>
      <P>But for the church leaders' efforts, Taiwan wouldn't be a democracy as it is
now, the president went on.</P>
      <P>Noting that the democracy in the country still has to be solidified and
improved, the president urged the church and its leaders to keep their efforts
in building the country into a normal state by helping with the country's bid
for U.N. membership.</P>

      <P>Taipei City's consumer price index (CPI) for July increased 0.17 percent over
the level posted in June, according to tallies released Monday by the Taipei
City Department of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DBAS).</P>
      <P>The July CPI figure represented an increase of 0.19 percent over the level for
the same month last year, DBAS officials said.</P>
      <P>DBAS  officials  attributed  the  rise  mainly  to soaring international oil
prices and increases in the cost of travel overseas.</P>
      <P>Prices in the service sector increased by an average of 0.82 percent over the
June level and by 1.36 percentyear-on-year, while prices of commercial goods
declined by 0.54 percent from the June level and by 1.06 percent year-on-year,
Taipei City officials said.</P>
      <P>By category, prices for traveling overseas jumped by an average of 2.37 percent
over the June level, while plane ticket prices rose 1.14 percent, both as a
result of spiraling oil prices.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, prices of miscellaneous items increased by an average of 0.25
percent, while medical and health prices rose 0.06 percent from the June level.</P>
      <P>Clothing and footwear prices, however, declined by a whopping 6.22 percent over
the June level, largely because of summer sales at most of the city's department
stores, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Vegetable and fruit prices also declined, dropping 0.31 percent from the June
level, they said.</P>
      <P>Comparing with the same month last year, prices of education and entertainment,
including overseas travel, increased by an average of 2.58 percent,  while
clothing  prices soared 3.25 percent and medication and health food prices
jumped 3.16 percent, they said.</P>
      <P>Food prices declined 3.75 percent year-on-year in July, the officials added.</P>
      <P>For the first seven months of this year, Taipei's CPI increased 0.72 percent
year-on-year, with clothing prices rising 2.18 percent; prices of miscellaneous
items moving up 2.13 percent; education and entertainment prices up 1.95
percent; medical and health prices up 1.8 percent; transportation prices up 1.38

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian touted Monday the contribution of Taiwan's tailoring
industry to boosting the country's profile in the international arena.</P>
      <P>Making the remarks while addressing the opening of the 32nd World Congress of
Master Tailors being held Aug. 5-10 in Taipei, Chen noted that master tailors
from Taiwan have won various  awards in international competitions since they
joined the World Federation of Master Tailors in 2003.</P>
      <P>For example, during the 31st World Congress of Master Tailors in Berlin,
Germany, delegates from Taiwan won the gold medal for dressmakers and second
prize for tailors in the Golden Needle and Golden Thread Awards, Chen pointed
out.</P>
      <P>Through the joint efforts of the Association of Taiwan Master Tailors, the
Taiwan External Trade Development Council and Taiwan's representative office in
Germany, Taiwan won the right to host the 32nd congress, he said.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, while the holding of the congress in Taiwan shows the world
that Taiwan's tailoring skills are comparable with those of Western countries,
the event also lets people see how Taiwan tailors "use their needles and threads
to sew a new ground for the country's foreign relations."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 40 percent of Taiwan women do not undergo a Pap smear test at least
once a year, even though free cervical cancer screening has been offered by the
government since 1995, a doctor at National Cheng Kung University (NCKU)
Hospital said Monday.</P>
      <P>Cheng Ya-ming,  a doctor in the hospital's  Department of Obstetrics and
Gynecology, noted that an estimated 500,000 women around the world die from
cervical cancer each year, while in Taiwan, this type of cancer also poses as a
major health threat to women, with the number of new cases per year reaching
6,000.</P>
      <P>With some 1,000 women in Taiwan dying from cervical cancer each year, it has
become the leading cause of death among women in the country.</P>
      <P>Cheng expressed regret that although the government has since 1995 offered a
free Pap smear screening a year for woman over the age of 30, it still seems
difficult to get some women to receive the tests. He said women aged 30-50 years
old form the bulk of those undergoing annual screening,  with few women who have
reached menopause requesting such tests.</P>
      <P>To encourage more women to undergo Pap smear screening, NCKU Hospital will hold
a lucky draw each week for those who do so, with the prize being a 30-percent-
discount health check coupon.</P>
      <P>As to alternatives, Cheng said that an anti-cervical cancer vaccine developed
last year may reduce women's anxiety over the cancer. However, the vaccine is
not covered by the national health insurance program. According to Cheng, each
dose of vaccine costs NT$4,000 (US$122), with the amount recommended by doctors
being three doses.</P>

      <P>Excessive intake of "healthy" beverages, such as sports drinks, high fiber
drinks or "fat-cutting" soft drinks might backfire and undermine the drinkers'
health, the John Tung Foundation claimed Monday.</P>
      <P>At a news conference to announce the findings of a recent survey conducted by
the foundation on the relationship between bottled beverages and health, Hsu
Hui-yu, a John Tung Foundation official in charge of nutrition, said that
swallowing a 350 cc bottle of sports drink is equal to taking 5.4 cubes of
sugar.</P>
      <P>Hsu quoted the results of the survey conducted between February and March this
year among some 1,000 elementary schoolchildren islandwide as showing that 67
percent of the children and 65 percent of their parents thought sports drinks
are healthy beverages and believed that the more the children drink, the
healthier they will become.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Hsu pointed out, a 350cc bottle of sports drink contains 110 big
calories, as well as electrolytes that can increase the burden on the heart,
blood vessels and kidneys.</P>
      <P>The current fad for beverages containing "high fiber" or "algae" -- claimed by
the manufacturers as being able to cut weight -- will not help lose weight, but
rather might cause nutritious imbalance, said Chiang Chun-ping, a pediatrician
at Mackay Memorial Hospital in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the best drink for people, particularly elementary schoolchildren,
is boiled water and that "fiber drinks" can never replace vegetables when it
comes to taking natural fiber to help with digestion and seeking balanced
nutrition.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's largest telecommunication company, Chunghwa Telecom, will replace the
existing public pay phones around the country with new ones that accept both

      <P>Three kinds of public phones are currently in use -- those that accept only
coins, those that accept only optical cards and those that accept only IC cards,
the officials noted, adding that the situation has caused great inconvenience to

      <P>Although the demand for public phones is declining owing to the popularity of
mobile phones, it is necessary for the company to integrate the functions of
public phones to provide convenient, basic telecommunication services to the

      <P>Chunghwa Telecom will install 1,000 coin/card pay phones starting this month,
before installing another 2,500 at the end of this year, they said.</P>
      <P>In addition to accepting both coins and cards, the new phones will also have
other new functions that allow users to adjust the phone volume and to make a

      <P>Two Taiwanese brothers with the rare Duchenne muscular dystrophy have arrived in
New York City to realize their dream of visiting the Statue of Liberty, with
help of enterprises and charity organizations.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yi-kai, the elder brother, and Tseng Yi-chi, both of whom are now in their
teens, have suffered from the inherited fatal disorder that is characterized by
rapidly progressive muscle weakness and atrophy for many years.</P>
      <P>The brothers are being accompanied by their mother Lin Chin-lien, Hsu Chi-
hsiang, an ENT doctor from Taipei Medical University Hospital and Taiwan
Foundation for Rare Disorders Secretary Chang Yen-ling.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who volunteered to offer medical care for the two brothers on the trip,
said it has been the most difficult task he has had this year, as each of the
brothers needs 20 pillows to keep a proper sitting position due to their very
serious curvature of the spine and because  every change of position  takes
about 20 minutes to accomplish.</P>
      <P>Paragon Investment Managers Inc. paid the travel fees of more than NT$300,000
(US$9,100) for them, and China Airlines upgraded their tickets to business class
in order to give them a more comfortable flight.</P>
      <P>They received a warm welcome from the New York branch of the Buddhist
Compassionate Relief Tzu-chi Foundation upon their arrival and the branch
arranged volunteer workers and doctors to accompany them during their stay in
New York, branch Chairman Chang Chi-tuo said.</P>
      <P>During their eight-day visit, they will make paintings of the Statue of Liberty,
which symbolizes freedom -- the thing they long for the most as they are
confined to wheelchairs. They will also visit Yankee Stadium to cheer for
Taiwan-born pitcher Chien-ming Wang. They might also go to the Empire State
Building, Central Park, and the American Museum of Natural History if their
health allows, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The branch has also arranged to hold a blessing party Aug. 10 for the two
brothers, Chang went on.</P>
      <P>Their mother, who has taken care of them alone for many years with subsidies
from the government, expressed deep gratitude to those who helped the brothers

      <P>The Taipei health authorities are working on a plan to make the city's 2,000
convenience stores part of Taipei's first aid network, officials of the city
government's Department of Health said Monday.</P>
      <P>The officials said the plan will see convenience store employees offered the
opportunity to go on training programs so that they can be issued with first aid
and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) certification.</P>
      <P>The convenience stores, found in every community and operating on a 24-hour

08/06/07  19:49:18

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two opposition Kuomintang lawmakers said Monday that they will turn down a
Ministry of National Defense (MND) invitation to visit the United States, in a
bid to avoid "endorsing" the ministry's plans to procure U.S. weaponry systems.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Su Chi said he will boycott the proposed U.S.trip on the grounds
that the MND altered the itinerary unilaterally by adding a visit to a shipyard
that builds Aegis-equipped warships and that Vice Defense Minister Ko Cheng-heng
and his aides will join the legislators on the trip without notifying the
legislators before the invitations were issued.</P>
      <P>Su complained that agreeing to visit the Aegis producer would be tantamount to
endorsing a possible procurement of the Aegis combat system-equipped Arleigh
Burke-class destroyers and that the number of MND officials would surpass the
number of legislators expected to go on the tour if Ko and his aides accompany
the lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Likening the MND to "a magician who produces rabbits and doves from his top hat
without notice, " Su said he wonders what else the ministry will do once the
legislators, from across the political spectrum, are off to the United States.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Shuai Hua-min said Taiwan does not need any Aegis-equipped
warships, adding that the Republic of China Navy cannot afford the ships and
lacks the ability to maintain them.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Shuai said, Aegis warships are designed to execute long-range anti-
missile missions over distances of 500 nautical miles, far larger than Taiwan's
territorial water limits.</P>
      <P>There have been twists and turns since the MND announced its plans in early July
to organize the U.S.trip for legislators.</P>
      <P>Two legislators traded barbs July 11 over the proposed visit, with one accusing
the MND of organizing the trip at taxpayers' expense and the other lambasting
the accuser as playing to the gallery by smearing his colleagues.</P>
      <P>The dispute stems from an accusation made by KMT Legislator Lin Yu-fang, who
claimed that the ministry was trying to "buy" lawmakers' support for its plan to
acquire eight U.S.-built submarines by offering them free trips to the United
States.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the so-called fact-finding trip had already attracted 24
lawmakers from across the political spectrum and will cost the MND more than
NT$10 million, to be financed by a NT$200 million (US$6.09 million) budget
passed by the legislature June 15 to assess the feasibility of acquiring the
submarines.</P>
      <P>Lin claimed that many of the lawmakers in the proposed delegation do not even
sit on the legislature's Committee for Defense Affairs, and that the organizers
altered the itinerary to accommodate some lawmakers' requests for private trips
during the visit.</P>
      <P>He urged the lawmakers to withdraw from the trip to "save their integrity."</P>
      <P>However, Lin's claims irritated Legislator Fu Kun-chi of the opposition People
First Party (PFP), who is one of the 24 lawmakers planning to take advantage of
the free trip offer.</P>
      <P>Fu said his party is one of the firm opponents of the billion arms acquirement
project and claimed that PFP officials asked party lawmakers in the delegation
to pay their own fares.</P>
      <P>He accused Lin of trying to smear his colleagues for personal political gain.</P>
      <P>According to an original itinerary revealed by the United Daily News in mid-
July, the trip, slated from Aug.14-26, will take the lawmakers to Washington,
D.C., Boston, Los Angeles and Hawaii, and will include visits to defense
contractors General Electric Co., Northrop Grumman Crop., Raytheon Corp.and
Lockheed Martin Corp.</P>
      <P>The MND has wanted the submarines since 2004, but a budget bill for the deal has
been bogged down in the opposition-controlled legislature ever since.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Thanks to significant drops in fruit and vegetable prices, Taiwan's consumer
price index (CPI) for July was 105.01, declined 0.34 percent over the same month
of last year, an official of the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Prices of vegetables and fruit for July were lower than the same month of last
year due to a good harvest, with vegetable prices moving down 29.07 percent and
fruit prices dropping 12.68 percent, said Wu Chao-ming, a DGBAS section chief.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, last year's prices were comparatively higher as farmers
suffered losses of about NT$300 million (US$9.1 million) because of damage
caused by two typhoons.</P>
      <P>As the vegetable and fruit price drops offset price hikes for cooking oil, eggs
and milk in July, Wu said the month's CPI registered a negative growth as
compared with the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>If prices drops for vegetables and fruit were excluded, the annual growth rate
of the CPI for July this year reached 1.44 percent, which was the highest in the
last five months, Wu said, adding that vegetables and fruit account for a large
weight in the CPI calculation.</P>

      <P>Water officials at the Ministry of Economic Affairs have mixed feelings about
tropical storm Pabuk, currently approaching Taiwan.</P>
      <P>With the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) poised to issue a sea warning for Pabuk
late Monday night or Tuesday morning, officials with the Water Resources Agency
said Monday that while they fervently hope Pabuk will bring timely rains to
relieve Taiwan's water-thirsty areas, they also fear that the tropical storm
will leave damage in its wake.</P>
      <P>Chen Shen-hsien, director of the Water Resources Agency, said his agency has
taken precautionary measures by asking River Management offices in southern
Taiwan to move their 12-inch mobile water pumps to strategic points in central
and northern Taiwan to prevent flooding.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taitung County in eastern Taiwan has been hit hard by the most
serious drought in 30 years, Chen said he hopes that the rain brought by Pabuk
will allow farmers there to salvage some of their crops.</P>
      <P>Taitung county's Chihshang township, one of Taiwan's main centers for producing
organic rice, has recorded total rainfall of only 258 mm so far this year --
less than one third of the normal amount. Farmers have waited in vain for rain
to begin their second-stage rice planting.</P>
      <P>Chen added that some of the areas in northern Taiwan, including Keelung, Sijihe
and Juifang, also need rain badly to replenish their reservoirs and soothe the
parched land.</P>
      <P>According to a CWB weather report, Pabuk, located about 1,000 km southeast of
Taiwan, was moving northwesterly at 28 kph. If it maintains its present course,
the storm's center is expected to make landfall in Taiwan early Wednesday.</P>

      <P>The state-owned Taiwan Power Co. announced Monday a plan to construct a 60-km
undersea electric cable linking Taiwan proper and its outlying island of Penghu
as part of the company's efforts to secure supplies of wind-powered electricity
between the two places.</P>
      <P>The NT$14.68  billion  (US$445 million)  plan is currently undergoing an
environmental impact assessment, a company spokesman said, who estimated that
the entire project would be finished in November 2012 if the assessment is
completed by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Once the cable is completed, wind-powered electricity on Penghu could be
produced on a massive scale, the spokesman noted.</P>
      <P>The undersea electric cable will serve as a backup system, but one which the
spokesman said must be put in place in advance.</P>
      <P>Without a backup system, if the wind becomes unstable, the outlying island's
power system will be compromised, leading to the possibility of a comprehensive
shutdown, the spokesman added.</P>
      <P>Globally, the Penghu area is one of the best suitable places for wind power
generation, with annual wind speed averaging over eight meters per second, the
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>If the use of Penghu's wind power could be increased, the country's demand for
expensive diesel-powered electricity will be reduced, and emissions of carbon
dioxide will also decrease, the spokesman went on.</P>
      <P>The company began turning Penghu's wind into an alternative energy source in the
late 1990s, and has continued to increase investments ever since, the spokesman
remarked.</P>
      <P>The company is still negotiating with local residents on the outlying island in
the hope of reaching an early consensus on the specifics of the project,
according to the spokesman.</P>

      <P>The U.S. government has not yet responded to President Chen Shui-bian's planned
transit stops in the United States en route to his Central American visit late
this month, Minister of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) James Huang said Monday.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks during a swearing-in ceremony for new chiefs of Taiwan's
representative offices abroad. At that time, Huang stressed that many recent
reports of local media regarding Chen's transit stop in U.S. were for the most
part speculative.</P>
      <P>Huang was responding to local reports that Washington has refused Chen's request
for a transit stop in the continental United States to make known its
displeasure over Chen's proposal to push for a referendum on whether the island
should apply U.N. membership under the name of "Taiwan". The U.S. sees such a
referendum as an attempt to unilaterally change the status quo across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Concerning recent remarks by Tom Casey, deputy spokesman of the U.S. State
Department, on the transit policy of the United Sates, which saw Casey skip over
the "dignity" of treatment the U.S. government usually accords Taiwanese leaders
when they make a transit stop in the U.S., mentioning instead only the
principles of safety, comfort and convenience for the traveler, Huang said
Washington has assured him that U.S. transit policy remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>Asked about whether China has protested former Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen's
serving as Chen's special envoy to attend a summit of Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum to be held in Australia in early September, Huang said
the government has not yet presented its envoy proposal to Australia, and most
of the reports are merely speculative.</P>
      <P>As to the return of Chen's letter requesting U.N. membership for Taiwan under
the name "Taiwan" by China's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Wang
Guangya in late July, Huang said Wang failed to do his job properly as the
rotating president of the U.N. Security Council for July by not delivering the
letter to the U.N. Security Council for screening.</P>
      <P>Wang's behavior reflected China's long-term arbitrary repression and bullying of
Taiwan in the world community, and Taiwan will fight for its rights, Huang
stressed.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times:Bush Signs Law to Widen Legal Reach for Wiretapping

President Bush signed into law on Sunday legislation that broadly expanded the
governments authority to eavesdrop on the international telephone calls and
e-mail messages of American citizens without warrants.

Congressional aides and others familiar with the details of the law said that
its impact went far beyond the small fixes that administration officials had
said were needed to gather information about foreign terrorists.

Wall Street Journal:How Bear Stearns Mess Cost Executive His Job

On Wednesday James Cayne, the 73-year-old chief executive of Bear Stearns Cos.,
summoned his top lieutenant to his smoky, dimly lit office in midtown Manhattan.

The big securities firm Mr. Cayne had led as CEO for 14 years was under attack.
Two of its mortgage-related hedge funds had blown up, costing investors more
than $1 billion, and its stock was under siege, down 27% this year alone.

Bear's co-president quit, becoming Wall Street's highest-profile casualty in the
subprime -lending fiasco. As Wall Street banks face the risk of a broad bond-
market unwind, many longer- term holders believe recovery could stretch into
this fall.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>Beijing's torch relay scheme an attempt to belittle Taiwan: VP</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Monday that China is attempting to use the torch
relay route issue to belittle Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks during a meeting with foreign correspondents stationed in
Taiwan after Jiang Xiaoyu, the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic
games executive vice-president, said earlier that day that Beijing hopes Taiwan
can return to a consensus reached earlier this year so as to facilitate the
torch's travel through Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Olympic Games is a major sports event, Lu said Taiwan should
have the same right as other countries to take part in the games.</P>
      <P>She lamented that Beijing has maneuvered to politically exploit the situation,
referring to its plan to have the torch travel from South Korea to Vietnam and
then to Taiwan before proceeding to Hong Kong, Macau, and other Chinese cities
until it reaches at the host city, Beijing.</P>
      <P>The relay route shows clearly Beijing's intention to claim sovereignty over
Taiwan, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Beijing even attempted  to change the name of the Taiwan delegation from its
official name of "Chinese Taipei" to "China Taipei," she continued.</P>
      <P>"Such political maneuvering is a violation of the spirit of Olympic Games," she
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan still hopes that the torch can travel from South Korea to Taiwan and then
proceed on to Vietnam and continue to Hong Kong and Macau, Lu said, adding that
Taiwan is still working toward the " third country in, third country out" goal.</P>
      <P>Jiang criticized Taiwan in April for "breach of agreement" after it turned down
a Beijing offer to be included in the Olympic torch relay.</P>
      <P>Jiang even produced a copy of the minutes of a February meeting between Chinese
Taipei Olympic Committee Chairman Thomas W. Tsai and Beijing Olympic organizers,
during which a four-point consensus was reached on the torch relay route.</P>
      <P>In response, Tsai said in Taipei that conference minutes did not qualify as a
formal agreement. "We have never been formally committed to accepting Beijing's
proposals regarding Taiwan's role or place in the torch relay," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou, the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) candidate for the 2008
presidential election, said Monday that he will begin the second phase of his
"long stay" campaign targeting southern Taiwan Tuesday as part of his efforts to
solicit grassroots support.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during an interview with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Allaying fears that he might encounter strong opposition from locals, Ma said
that he will do his utmost to make people aware of his sincerity, describing
himself as an "easy-going person."</P>
      <P>Residents in southern Taiwan are traditionally regarded as staunch supporters of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , KMT's rival.</P>
      <P>Ma said that his previous 10-day bike tour of 19 cities and counties around the
country generated satisfactory results because locals came to realize that he
attaches great importance to them.</P>
      <P>During the first phase of his "long stay" campaign in Taichung, Changhua and
Nantou in central Taiwan, Ma said that he stayed overnight in locals' homes
during one third of the 18-day trip in the three central counties.</P>
      <P>Ma added that he will do the same throughout the second phase of his campaign in
the three southern counties of Yulin, Chiayi, and Tainan.</P>
      <P>Noting that with a population of over 3.4 million, the three counties produce
most of the country's domestic rice, but has serious land-sinking problem, Ma
said that he will learn more about the region during the trip, hoping that the
locals can also come to a better understanding of him.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The consumer price index (CPI) reflects the general condition of product prices
in Taiwan, an official of the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) explained Monday amid public doubts of the newly released CPI
figures.</P>
      <P>Wu Chao-ming, a section chief of the DGBAS, said the CPI works by showing
average price changes including ups and downs during a period of time, instead
of reflecting price changes of particular products, therefore, the CPI result
will be more moderate than specific products' price changes.</P>
      <P>According to a report released by the DGBAS, the CPI for July was 105.01, down
by 0.34 over the same month last year, which was the biggest drop since last
November.</P>
      <P>Quoting the results of the report, Wu said the five goods that showed the
biggest price hikes were: Chinese herbal medicine, 62.6 percent, yellow croaker,
21.65 percent, cooking oil, 16.65, gas, 14.8, and group travel fees, 14.33
percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the five articles showing the biggest price drops are onion, 68.76,
papaya, 39.49, balsam pear, 37.64, watermelon, 34.62, and cell phone, 22.92
percent, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu pointed out that price drops in vegetables and fruit offset price hikes for
other categories, as fruits and vegetables are heavily weighted in the CPI
calculation.</P>

      <P>Huang Li-feng  said that faculty and students  of Chihpen Elementary School are

    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) presidential candidate described
Taiwan's status quo Monday as "one Taiwan, separate definitions, " but claimed
that the ruling and opposition parties' definitions are partially overlapping,
with the "Republic of China" title being the greatest common denominator for all
sides.</P>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou made the remarks in an interview with the Central News Agency. It
also marked the first time that Ma has coined such a term to explain Taiwan's
present political situation.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) argues that
Taiwan is already an independent country, even though its official title remains
as the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Ma said, the KMT has consistently maintained that the Republic of
China is an independent sovereign country.</P>
      <P>As to China's attitude, Ma claimed that Beijing leaders are more tolerant of the
"Republic of China" title than they are of "Taiwan independence."</P>
      <P>Ma also challenged the Mainland Affairs Council's inference that as the ratio of
local people considering themselves "Taiwanese" has surpassed those who consider
themselves to be "Chinese" or both "Taiwanese and Chinese, " the national
consciousness of the people of Taiwan has undergone a fundamental change.</P>
      <P>Ma, a Harvard-trained politician, said Taiwan consciousness is not tantamount to
"Taiwan independence consciousness." While many people consider themselves to be
Taiwanese, Ma claimed that the number of people who explicitly support Taiwan
independence remains a minority and that maintaining the present status quo
enjoys the support of mainstream public opinion.</P>
      <P>While China is the most vocal opponent of Taiwanese independence, Ma claimed
that the Beijing leadership focuses its target mainly on "de jure" Taiwan
independence, namely writing a new constitution and rectifying the country's
name.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's people can now elect their own president and lawmakers and manage
their own affairs, Ma said Taiwan now enjoys de facto independence. Despite that
reality, war has not erupted across the Taiwan Strait. Against this backdrop, Ma
said the current status quo has become "one Taiwan, separate definitions, " with
the KMT asserting that the Republic of China continues to exist, and the DPP
asserting that Taiwan is already an independent country with the Republic China
as its official designation.</P>
      <P>Ma further claimed that China originally would not accept the "Republic of
China" and regard it as a "C-type Taiwan independence."</P>
      <P>With the development of cross-strait relations, Ma claimed that the Chinese
mainland has adjusted its "one country, two systems" unification stance into one
that places more emphasis on preventing independence than on promoting
unification.</P>
      <P>"Beijing leaders have come to understand that advocacting the Republic of
China's continued existence  is a lesser evil in comparison to advocating Taiwan
independence. And this is our present status quo, " Ma said, adding that the
Republic of China is the greatest common denominator acceptable to all parties
concerned.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that
the ongoing embezzlement case is a major test for him.</P>
      <P>Ma also said that drawing on his own personal experience, he plans to submit
judicial reform policies after the Taipei District Court hands down a ruling on
his case Aug. 14.</P>
      <P>He noted that even during the last court hearing on the case July 31, the
prosecution failed to produce substantial incriminating evidence against him.</P>
      <P>The prosecution indicted him mainly because they believed that during his term
as Taipei mayor 1998-2006, he "cheated" the staff of the Taipei city government
every month to claim the "special allowance fund" put for his discrecional use,
according to Ma.</P>
      <P>"I'm sure a lot of people wouldn't put up with such an allegation, "Ma said.</P>
      <P>On the upcoming court ruling, Ma said that "I have confidence in my innocence,
and I expect a just ruling from the court."</P>
      <P>Ma said that he has "braced for every outcome" although it will not affect his
determination to run in the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>He said that in the West, judges will rule the defendant not guilty if there is
insufficient evidence to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.</P>
      <P>As a defendant, Ma say he has learned first-hand about the investigative and the
litigation process, which he said will be valuable for him in working out
judicial reform policies.</P>
      <P>He cited, as an example, that a prosecutor's deposition can vary from the
statement of a witness, something that he couldn't possibly have known even
though he once served as justice minister.</P>
      <P>Ma was indicted Feb. 13 on charges of corruption. Prosecutor Hou Kuan-jen said
in the indictment that Ma received NT$10.23 million in special allowances during
his first term from December 1998 to December 2003.</P>
      <P>However, the expenditure records of Ma's bank accounts show that he spent only
NT$3.49 million of that amount, but did not return the unspent portion --
NT$6.74 million -- to the national coffers.</P>
      <P>From January 2004 to July 2006, Ma used NT$630,000 of the NT$5.06 million fund
and kept the remaining NT$4.43 million in his account.</P>
      <P>Hou contends that the unspent money during his two terms, totaling NT$11.17
million, should be considered "gains from embezzlement."</P>
      <P>Hou rejected an interpretation by the Ministry of Justice last November that
special allowance funds for executives of government departments are actually
meant as salary subsidies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that
the KMT has adopted a "pragmatic" means of promoting a referendum on Taiwan's
bid to join the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks in an interview with the CNA when he compared the KMT's
approach with that of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , noting
that President Chen Shui-bian has promoted a referendum on joining the U.N.
under the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the KMT's way is to authorize the administrative branch to find the
best name, or a name that is most beneficial and dignified to the island, to
join the United Nations.</P>
      <P>He noted that "joining or re-entering international organizations is not
something that can be decided by us, " noting that "even if Taiwan passes the
referendum on its U.N. bid, the United Nations still will not admit the island."</P>
      <P>"The key lies in the kind of organizations, and entering them under what name,
" Ma said,  noting that Taiwan joined the International Olympic Committee under
the name of "Chinese Taipei, " and joining the World Trade Organization under
the name of "Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu."</P>
      <P>Ma said further that Taiwan has not succeeded in joining any international
organizations under the name "Taiwan" over the past 20 or 30 years.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Organization has been repeatedly thwarted
and its chances of joining the United Nations under that name should be clear,
Ma said.</P>
      <P>He noted that President Chen Shui-bian twice wrote to U.N. Secretary-General Ban
Ki-boon on the island's bid to join the world body recently, but his letters
were returned both times.</P>
      <P>He said that the KMT, during its five decades of rule, had promoted
unconventional  diplomacy  and  accumulated  valuable experience, and so will
adopt a "pragmatic" approach in joining international organizations.</P>
      <P>He termed the DPP's advocacy of its United Nations bid under the name of Taiwan
a "strategic error," as the party's aim is not to join the United Nations, but
to create divisions with the aim of proving its gallantry, although the action
"will do Taiwan no good."</P>

      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) issued a sea warning against tropical storm
Pabuk late Monday as the storm was swirling toward waters off Taiwan's eastern
coast.</P>
      <P>The eye of Pabuk, the sixth typhoon in the West Pacific this year, was 711
kilometers east-southeast of the eastern county of Hualien at 11 p.m., CWB
meteorologists said, adding that the light typhoon was moving west-northwest at
20 kilometers per hour.</P>
      <P>Waters northeast and southeast of Taiwan will come under the influence of the
storm, the meteorologists said, adding that ships operating in those areas
should maintain vigilance. People should also refrain from visiting costal
regions in eastern Taiwan as there will be high waves there.</P>
      <P>The storm has gained strength moderately in the past three hours, with sustained
winds of 90 kilometers, the meteorologists noted, adding that if the storm
maintains its current course, the bureau is scheduled to issue a land warning
early Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Pabuk is the name of a large fresh water fish in Laos, according to the Hong

      <P>Ma was indicted Feb. 13 on charges of corruption. Prosecutor Hou Kuan-jen said
in the indictment that Ma received NT$10.23 million in special allowances during
his first term from December 1998 to December 2003.</P>
      <P>However, the expenditure records of Ma's bank accounts show that he spent only
NT$3.49 million of that amount, but did not return the unspent portion --
NT$6.74 million -- to the national coffers.</P>
      <P>From January 2004 to July 2006, Ma used NT$630,000 of the NT$5.06 million fund
and kept the remaining NT$4.43 million in his account.</P>
      <P>Hou contends that the unspent money during his two terms, totaling NT$11.17
million, should be considered "gains from embezzlement."</P>
      <P>Hou rejected an interpretation by the Ministry of Justice last November that
special allowance funds for executives of government departments are actually
meant as salary subsidies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT adopts 'pragmatic' means to promote U.N. bid: candidate</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  6 (CNA)
08/07/07  10:28:58
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that
the KMT has adopted a "pragmatic" means of promoting a referendum on Taiwan's
bid to join the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks in an interview with the CNA when he compared the KMT's
approach with that of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , noting
that President Chen Shui-bian has promoted a referendum on joining the U.N.
under the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the KMT's way is to authorize the administrative branch to find the
best name, or a name that is most beneficial and dignified to the island, to
join the United Nations.</P>
      <P>He noted that "joining or re-entering international organizations is not
something that can be decided by us, " noting that "even if Taiwan passes the
referendum on its U.N. bid, the United Nations still will not admit the island."</P>
      <P>"The key lies in the kind of organizations, and entering them under what name,
" Ma said,  noting that Taiwan joined the International Olympic Committee under
the name of "Chinese Taipei, " and joining the World Trade Organization under
the name of "Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu."</P>
      <P>Ma said further that Taiwan has not succeeded in joining any international
organizations under the name "Taiwan" over the past 20 or 30 years.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Organization has been repeatedly thwarted
and its chances of joining the United Nations under that name should be clear,
Ma said.</P>
      <P>He noted that President Chen Shui-bian twice wrote to U.N. Secretary-General Ban
Ki-boon on the island's bid to join the world body recently, but his letters
were returned both times.</P>
      <P>He said that the KMT, during its five decades of rule, had promoted
unconventional  diplomacy  and  accumulated  valuable experience, and so will
adopt a "pragmatic" approach in joining international organizations.</P>
      <P>He termed the DPP's advocacy of its United Nations bid under the name of Taiwan
a "strategic error," as the party's aim is not to join the United Nations, but
to create divisions with the aim of proving its gallantry, although the action
"will do Taiwan no good."</P>

      <P>An immigration officer in the southern city of Chiayi has been arrested and
taken into custody on charges of corruption and leaking of official secrets,
prosecution authorities said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Chiayi District Court approved prosecutors' application for the detention of
Lin Shun-tang, a squadron chief of the National Immigration Agency's (NIA's)
Chiayi branch, late Monday after he was questioned  by judicial personnel for
several hours about his suspected criminal offenses.</P>
      <P>Lin is accused of having leaked information to manpower brokers before spot
checks by law enforcement officers on illegal migrant workers for which he
received entertainment in return.</P>
      <P>He is also suspected of having colluded with those brokers to secure monetary
rewards set up by the government to encourage law enforcement officers to seize
illegal immigrants.</P>
      <P>According to prosecutors, the manpower brokers allegedly would first "dump" at
designated locations disobedient, unqualified or incompetent illegal foreign
workers and those who were willing to return home voluntarily and then would tip
Lin off so that he could arrest them and claim the prize money from the
immigration agency.</P>
      <P>As both alleged crimes committed by Lin are felonies which carry a minimum
prison sentence of five years, prosecutors said he should be held incommunicado
pending further investigations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun said Tuesday that
he is poised to continue promoting the "normal country" resolution as it is
vital to help boost the party's chances in coming elections.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks during a meeting with representatives of various pro-Taiwan
independence groups at the DPP's headquarters.</P>
      <P>According to Yu, the DPP core supporters' pro-Taiwan independence stance must be
made clear in a party resolution so as to solidify a consensus and encourage
party candidates to score a victory in the Jan. 12 legislative election and the
March 22, 2008 presidential poll.</P>
      <P>"How could DPP candidates compete other parties' opponents in the coming
elections if the party fails to provide the public with a clear vision regarding
the country's future?" he argued.</P>
      <P>The resolution, designed to turn Taiwan into what Yu called a normal country,
was approved by the DPP's Central Standing Committee, and President Chen Shui-
bian displayed his support for the resolution during a meeting last week
attended by ranking officials from the party, the Executive Yuan and the
Presidential Office, he said.</P>
      <P>Nor did Frank Hsieh, the DPP's presidential candidate who also took part in the
meeting, voice objections to the resolution, he noted.</P>
      <P>Brushing aside allegations from some party members that the "normal country"
resolution would take a toll on the DPP in the upcoming two elections, Yu said
that he is willing to take full responsibility for its negative impact, although
it was agreed upon by the Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>"If the DPP lacks a consensus on Taiwan's future and fails to come up with such
a resolution, it would dampen the hopes of the party's supporters and ruin its
chances in future elections,"  he contended.</P>
      <P>The DPP must craft an electoral strategy to distinguish itself from other
parties with the "normal country" resolution that will benefit this country in
the short, middle and long terms, he claimed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's eventual unification with China, broached by the main opposition
Kuomintang, is tantamount to a suicide for Taiwan, while the idea of maintaining
the status quo across the Taiwan Strait is the equivalent to the gradual suicide
of the country, he claimed, insisting that neither is beneficial to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For their parts, representatives from the various pro-Taiwan independence groups
urged Yu to put forward a more clear-cut and radical resolution to advance
Taiwan independence, as the "normal country" resolution, initiated by Yu himself
early this year, fails to shrug off the "one China" concept contained in the
current Republic of China Constitution.</P>
      <P>They suggested Yu discard the existing political framework of the ROC and
replace the "normal country" resolution with one that calls for the
establishment of a "Taiwan republic."</P>

      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) expanded the scope of its land warning for
Tropical Storm Pabuk afternoon as the storm reached the waters off Taiwan's
southeast coast Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The outlying island of Kinmen was added to the list of areas expected to be
affected by the storm within the next 24 hours. Already included in the list
were Hualien, Taitung, Green Island, Orchid Island, Ilan, Nantou, Yunlin,
Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung, Pingtung and Penghu, CWB forecasters said.</P>

Pratas Islands to remain alert.</P>
      <P>As of 4 p.m., the storm was centered 170 km east-northeast of the eastern county
of Taitung, moving westerly at 21-24 kph toward Taiwan and packing maximum
sustained winds of 101 kph, according to the CWB.</P>
      <P>The outer edge of Pabuk is expected to reach the southeastern part of Taiwan
Tuesday evening, with the eye of the storm projected to land in the area between
Hengchun and Taitung around midnight, forecasters said, adding that the storm
will have completely passed over Taiwan around noon Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The forecasters said Pabuk will bring strong winds to the Hualien and Taitung

      <P>The Taiwanese government will earmark NT$7.96 billion (US$241 million) to
rebuild 121 old bridges and repair 1,000 others in order to better safeguard
people's traffic safety, an official of the Executive Yuan's Public Construction
Commission said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The bridge repair program was passed last year, and is scheduled to be finished
within the three years from 2007-2009, the official said.</P>
      <P>Quoting statistics compiled by the commission, the official said Taiwan has a
total of 26,000 bridges, with an average age of 20 years, but 952 of the bridges
are more than 40 years old.</P>
      <P>The public became more concerned about the nation's bridge safety issue after a
bridge over the Mississippi river in the U.S. state of Minnesota collapsed Aug.
1, killing at least four and leaving 30 missing.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the government has collected and integrated data and
information about the nation's bridges from the Directorate General of Highways,
the Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau, the Taiwan Railway Administration, and
local governments since 2001, which will be used to provide references on
maintenance and repairs.</P>
      <P>The official said Taiwan's highway and water resource units will meet to
coordinate their actions and ensure smooth progress on repairs.</P>
      <P>The commission also asked authorities at all levels to implement bridge
maintenance  and evaluation,  to carry out inspections regularly, and record
inspection results in order to provide and ensure greater traffic safety.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is preparing for an onslaught by tropical storm Pabuk, the sixth named
storm in the western Pacific this year.</P>
      <P>The central government said Tuesday that it had activated its disaster response
center at the Ministry of the Interior's National Fire Agency.</P>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Lee Yi-yang, who serves as head of the center, urged
people in 13 most vulnerable cities and counties to store enough food and
drinking water to last from three to seven days.</P>
      <P>Marked for heightened alert are the eight cities of Hualien, Taitung,  Pingtung,
Yilan, Nantou, Yunlin, Chiayi, Tainan and Kaohsiung, together with the counties
of Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung and Penghu.</P>
      <P>Lee said he had ordered additional water pumps to be moved to flood-prone areas
in Yilan, Hualien and Taitung.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin also set up an emergency response center manned with
senior officials from different city government departments. He urged residents
to guard against flooding and falling billboards while the tropical storm is
passing through Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At least eight cities and counties have formed emergency response centers. While
the Cabinet-level Department of Health has placed medical teams and helicopters
on standby, the Ministry of National Defense has also ordered military units to
be ready to join disaster relief operations.</P>
      <P>On Orchid Island off the eastern coast of Taiwan, some 2,000 holidaymakers cut
short their stays and were ferried back to Taitung in eight boats early Tuesday.</P>
      <P>As winds and rain on Orchid island intensified, the Taitung county government
decided to suspend school classes and office work there from 2 p.m. It also
announced that all schools and public organizations in Taitung County will
remain closed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the Central Weather Bureau (CWB), Pabuk's center was located 140 km
southeast of Taitung at 6 p.m. Tuesday. With a 150-km radius, the tropical storm
was moving west at 26 kph and was expected to slow down to 22 kph.</P>
      <P>Packing center winds of 28 meters per second and gusts of up to 35 meters per
second, or 126 kph, Pabuk was expected to make landfall in Taiwan at around 11
p.m. Tuesday, with its center leaving the Hengchun peninsula at about 1 a.m.
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>CWB forecasts said Taiwan's eastern, central and southern areas might see at
least 200 mm of rainfall brought by the storm, with eastern Taiwan getting more
rain than other areas.</P>

      <P>A two-year-old Taiwanese girl developed serious complications triggered by
enterovirus type 71 (E71) soon after returning from a China visit late last
month, making her the country's first imported case of severe enterovirus
infection, a Center for Disease Control (CDC) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The girl traveled to Shenzhen in China's Guangdong province together with her
parents and four-year-old brother last month, only returning to Taiwan July 26,
according to CDC Deputy Director-General Chou Chih-hao.</P>
      <P>While the boy displayed hand-foot-and-mouth syndrome, a condition indicative of
a mild enterovirus infection, July 27, the girl came down with high fever,
muscle twitching, a rapid heart beat and sleepiness the following day, Chou
said.</P>
      <P>The case was reported to health authorities as a severe case of enterovirus
infection, and tests confirmed the diagnosis, Chou said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the incubation period of enterovirus infection usually runs between
three and five days, Chou said the two children were probably infected while in
Shenzhen.</P>
      <P>He said both the girl and her brother are recovering well and that the girl has
been transferred from an intensive care unit to an ordinary ward.</P>
      <P>CDC tallies show that three severe cases of enterovirus infection have been
recorded in Taiwan so far this year, two of which were caused by E71, including
this latest one.</P>
      <P>The other case, which resulted in death, was caused by echovirus type 6, another
member of the enterovirus family, according to the CDC.</P>
      <P>Taiwan experienced a severe outbreak of E71 -- the deadliest type of all
enteroviruses -- in 1988 when 405 children were infected, 78 of whom died.</P>
      <P>In another E71 outbreak in 2005, 145 children were infected, with 15 killed.</P>
      <P>Enterovirus are the most common cause of aseptic meningitis and can cause

      <P>The curtain fell on the Yilan International Folklore and Game Festival for good
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Magistrate Lu Kuo-hua announced the county government's decision to bring an end
to the annual festival in a press conference at county hall at the end of this
year's festival, citing the heavy losses incurred over the last two years.</P>
      <P>He attributed the festival's failure to competition from similar water theme
parks around the island, the rising price of general goods, and the baseless
criticisms leveled against the activity by certain media outlets.</P>
      <P>Lu said the two-month festival has created a financial burden of about NT$50
million for the county government during each of the last two years despite
efforts to curb costs.</P>
      <P>The decision to end the cultural activity was a difficult one as the event had
earned an international reputation for the eastern Taiwan county, and helped
enhance its profile and boosted local tourism, but the county simply can't bear
the financial burden without central government aid, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Citing the proverb that the finish line of one race is the starting line of
another, Lu said the county government will start planning a new activity for
the next summer to continue promoting Yilan as a tourist attraction.</P>
      <P>The festival, organized by the Cultural Bureau of the county government every
summer at the county's Dungshan River Park, was a hit when it started in 1997.
It featured performances by many foreign dance troupes and has attracted many
tourists from Taiwan and abroad.</P>

      <P>A better legal environment and government support will be the keys for the
development of Taiwan's already robust information technology (IT)
competitiveness if it wants to overtake Asia Pacific leaders Japan and South
Korea, an IT consultant said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's IT industry competitiveness ranks sixth globally and fourth in the Asia
Pacific region, according to the "IT industry competitiveness index" released by
the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) in July.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan's buildup on IT infrastructure and research and development, along
with a better legal environment and support from the government, Taiwan has the
potential to overtake Japan and South Korea, said Goh Seow Hiong, director of
Asia software policy of Business Software Alliance.</P>
      <P>The EIU has conducted a global survey for the first time to compare countries'
IT competitiveness by gauging their performance in six areas -- overall business
environment, IT infrastructure, human capital, legal environment, R&amp;D
environment and support for IT industry development -- with 100 representing the
highest score.</P>
      <P>Collaboration between the government and private sector has been very
successful, helping Taiwan establish a robust R&amp;D environment that ranks
third in the world, according to Goh, who added that the best example is the
success of the Industrial Technology Research Institute in Hsinchu.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's overall business environment, which ranked seventh globally, will enter
a phase where a lot of mergers occur in the future, he predicted.</P>
      <P>The government was encouraged to open the market for competition in order to
improve the IT infrastructure, which ranked a fair 18th out of 64 countries in
the survey. With the Institute for Information Industry leading the way,
government support is adequate, although a 19th place ranking shows there is a
lot of room of improvement, Goh pointed out.</P>
      <P>Creating a better legal environment is also vital, said Goh, who pointed out
that Taiwan ranked only 32nd in that category.</P>
      <P>In terms of government priorities, key findings in the survey are that the
government should ensure the flow of talent and support competition and
innovation without stifling them, and ensure better intellectual property rights
protection, he said.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, the top 10 countries with the strongest IT industry
competitiveness are the United States (77.4) , Japan (72.7) , South Korea (67.2)
, the United Kingdom (67.1), Australia and Switzerland (63.5).</P>

      <P>A group of Indonesian students in Taiwan held a press conference Tuesday to call
for local awareness and assistance in saving the Indonesian rainforest, which is
being rapidly destroyed.</P>
      <P>Indonesia, which has the second-largest rainforest in the world, is facing a
severe environmental crisis that even the people of Taiwan cannot overlook, said
group leader Denni, a junior at the Transworld Institute of Technology (TIT) in
Yunlin County.</P>
      <P>Denni was one of five Indonesian exchange students at TIT's Department of
Environmental Resources Management who made the appeal. They all came from the
Indonesian island of Sumantra.</P>
      <P>Indonesia's rainforest is vanishing at frightening speed because of illegal
logging, corruption and global warming he said, adding that the destruction has
led to the deaths of more than 1,000 orangutans, 33 Sumatran tigers and numerous
other endangered species every year.</P>
      <P>"People may think that Taiwan has nothing to do with the status of the
Indonesian rainforest. But most people don't realize that Taiwan has been
hurting the Earth more than other countries. That is why we should offer our
help more than anyone else, " said Chang Tzu-chien, a professor at TIT, who also
noted that the average greenhouse gas emission per person of Taiwan ranks third-
highest globally.</P>
      <P>The group of Indonesian students have been engaging in an international exchange
project, titled "Sustainable Sumatra, " a collaboration  of TIT's  Department
of Environmental  Resources Management  and Bodhicitta Mandala Conservation,  an
Indonesian non-government organization (NGO) that focuses on environmental
conservation.</P>
      <P>"Well-known NGOs such as the World Wildlife Foundation and Conservation
International have been trying to save the rainforest but the rate of
destruction has not slowed, largely as a result of poverty," Chang said.</P>
      <P>He said  the exchange  project  aims to work with  local organizations to
improve the local economy, public health, provide clean water and environmental
protection.</P>
      <P>"We feel obligated to so something for our home country. Hopefully, what we do
today can raise the awareness of Taiwanese people on the issue, " said Hendra, a

      <P>The Taipei First Girls' High School marching band is receiving wide acclaim at
the Edinburgh International Festival being held in the United Kingdom Aug. 3-25,
helping to increase Taiwan's profile on the world stage.</P>
      <P>Tong Dai-lin, one of the captains of the 135-member marching corps, said during
an interview with the Central News Agency Monday that she feels honored to
represent Taiwan at the Edinburgh Military Tattoo, an internationally renowned
event featuring military bands and other performing groups now in its 58th year.</P>
      <P>Tong, also the conductor of the band, said she is always deeply moved when tens
of thousands of people in audiences from various countries applaud the corps
members as they march.</P>
      <P>Asked how she has overcome homesickness during her first overseas tour, Tong
said she stopped missing her family after telling herself that she is making a
contribution to her country's international profile.</P>
      <P>Compared with other performing groups, the band is quite large and catches the
public's much attention, Tong said.</P>
      <P>During their month-long stay in the Scottish capital, the band members are
constantly  practicing  in order to perfect their performance, while also taking
time to work on their studies in the middle of the night, Tong stated.</P>
      <P>Noting that her fellow students are gradually used to the "fast pace of life in
Edinburgh, " Tong said she believes they will perform even better in the
remaining days of the event.</P>
      <P>She described the overseas performance as a precious opportunity, which she said
has expanded her horizons and changed her attitudes towards her life and future
plans.</P>
      <P>Yeh Wen-chin, another band captain, said that the corps members have also made
new friends among their counterparts, and that they are also teaching Chinese to
a group of U.K. bikers.</P>
      <P>Citing as an example Aug. 5 festival opening parade in Edinburgh, Yeh said they
were greatly touched by Taiwanese expatriates who cheered alongside the band,
waving the country's national flag.</P>
      <P>Huang Li-wen, also a member of the corps, said the band and the other

      <P>Approximately 25 percent of the Hushan reservoir in the southern county of
Yunlin had been completed as of July, Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) officials said Tuesday, estimating that the entire project
will be finished by 2014.</P>
      <P>The NT$20.5 billion (US$621 million) project is part of the government's efforts
to resolve a land sinkage problem in the county, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>The majority of the county's land is sinking, a problem resulting from local
residents pumping too much ground water for irrigation and aquaculture, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>Over 100 million tonnes of ground water is pumped out annually in the southern
county, the officials said, warning that water in some areas of the county has
also been found to be contaminated by toxic chemicals including arsenic and
nitrate nitrogen.</P>
      <P>The county's land sinking problem also needs to be curbed as it poses a safety
threat to the Yunlin station on the country's high speed railway, the officials
went on. The station is still under construction.</P>

      <P>Farmers in the eastern Taiwan county of Taitung were overjoyed Tuesday as rain
brought by Tropical Storm Pabuk began to fall on their drought-parched land.</P>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) issued a sea and land warning early Tuesday
when Pabuk was about 400 km southeast of Taitung, but hours later, shortly
before noon, long-awaited rain finally came -- first as fine drizzle, followed
by a two hour downpour.</P>
      <P>Elated farmers rushed to their land to check their irrigation systems to ensure
smooth flow of water. The step was necessary to make sure clogged water channels
did not cause overflows that could break the levees and ruin the whole field.</P>
      <P>The rice farmers, especially those in Chihshang township, one of Taiwan's main
centers for producing organic rice, have waited too long for rain to begin their
second rice planting this year.</P>
      <P>Water also began to flow in Taitung County's streams, which had run dry since
late June. The water level in the Hsinwulu river, the habitat of the Taiwan ku
fish, not only returned to normal but kept rising.</P>
      <P>For tea growers in the county, however, the rain came too late to salvage their
crops, with more than 60 percent of their plants already withered under the
scorching sun.</P>
      <P>Water resources  officials  at both the central and local government levels
expressed mixed feelings about Pabuk. Although they were delighted about the
rain it has brought, they also feared the tropical storm would leave a trail of
damage in its wake.</P>
      <P>Taitung County has been hit hard by the most serious drought in 30 years, with
only 258 mm of rain recorded for the first seven months of this year -- less
than one-third of the normal amount.</P>
      <P>Pabuk was expected to make landfall in Taiwan at around 11 p.m. Tuesday, with
its center leaving the Hengchung peninsula at about 1 a.m. Wednesday. According
to the CWB, most areas in Taiwan will see at least 200 mm of rain from Pabuk,

      <P>The executive branch supports impartial judicial probes into any corruption
cases involving government officials, Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Shieh made the remarks after investigators searched the office of Vice Economic
Affairs Minister Hou Ho-shong earlier in the day as part of a probe into alleged
corruption that might implicate dozens of other government officials.</P>
      <P>Led by prosecutors, nearly 200 staff members from the Ministry of Justice
Investigation Bureau searched Hou's office and several agencies under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) in its probe into suspected forgery and
influence peddling involving certain river and reservoir dredging and cleanup
projects.</P>
      <P>More than 30 officials from the MOEA's water resources bureaus and river
management offices are suspected of having given favors to specific contractors
employed to handle river and reservoir dredging and cleanup, according to
prosecution authorities.</P>
      <P>Shieh said the Executive Yuan fully supports prosecutorial probes into those
cases in an impartial manner. "Our hope is that there will be no false
prosecution and no tolerance of official wrongdoing, " he added.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Shieh said the MOEA will review its procurement bidding procedures and
check whether there is any gaps or holes in its supervisory mechanism. The MOEA
will also investigate whether any individuals should be held accountable for any

      <P>"Investigative results will be the basis in the MOEA's decision of its next

they will clear their names, " Shieh said, adding that the administration will

    <HEADLINE>Lifting ban on ractopamine requires DOH-COA approval: official</HEADLINE>

      <P>Removal of a ban on the use of the veterinary drug ractopamine in local hog and
cow farming and setting permissible residue levels will require a joint decision
and action of the Department of Health (DOH) and the Council of Agriculture
(COA), a food sanitation official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Cheng Hui-wen, director-general of the DOH's FBureau of Food Sanitation, made
the remarks in response to a protest earlier the same day by local pig raisers
who accused the government of seeking to remove the ban on the drug by seeking
endorsement from academics as a result of foreign pressure.</P>
      <P>Brushing aside hog raisers' allegations that the government is to lift the ban
on ractopamine, Cheng said the DOH will not do so "in a rush or in a reckless
manner."</P>
      <P>Cheng said the DOH will first ask experts to make a broad assessment on the
feasibility of permitting a maximum 10ppb residue of the substance in locally
produced pork or beef, as is the case in Japan.</P>
      <P>Japan was a major market for Taiwanese pork exports before the country was
listed as a foot-and-mouth disease affected area, and Japan allowed limited
ractopamine residue of under 10ppb,  he explained.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the DOH will not remove the ban unless relevant government agencies,
including the COA, have made concerted moves and agree to the use of the
currently banned drug.</P>
      <P>He also said it is wrong to mislead the public into believing that large amounts
of U.S. pork containing ractopamine residue has entered Taiwan because foreign
imports only account for 1 percent of local consumption and pork imported from
the United States, where use of the drug is permitted, only makes up of 0.7
percent of the total foreign imports.</P>
      <P>Two shipments of U. S. pork and some locally farmed pork were recently detected
to contain the drug, provoking "grave concern" among local consumers.</P>
      <P>A group of pig farmers, led by main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker Ko
Chun-hsiung, accused the DOH earlier that same day in a news conference of
seeking to ease its stance on the use of ractopamine as a result of foreign
pressure.</P>
      <P>Ko and Pan Lien-chou, a local hog-raising association chairman, made the
accusation after it was reported that the DOH might yield to pressure from
foreign countries and allow the use of the drug that can promote growth of lean
meat in pigs and poultry.</P>
      <P>Pan claimed that an estimated 1,000 metric tons of imported pork containing
ractopamine are currently waiting to enter Taiwan at Kaohsiung Port in southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Pan said he strongly suspects that the DOH will relax its ban on ractopamine and
claimed that allowing the use of the substance for local pig and cow farmers
will pose great risks to the public's health.</P>
      <P>Yin Ling-yin, a lawmaker of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union, also asked
the DOH to stick firm to its ban on ractopamine "for the sake of Taiwan
consumers' health."</P>
      <P>Yin demanded Cheng step down from his post to take responsibility if the U.S.
pork in Kaohsiung is allowed to enter Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) warned residents in northern and eastern Taiwan
Wednesday to prepare for possible downpours triggered by Tropical Storm Pabuk,
which is moving rapidly away from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The storm made landfall on the Hengchun Peninsula at the southernmost of Taiwan
at 1 a.m. Wednesday.</P>
      <P>As of 8 a.m., Pabuk was centered 140 km south-southwest of the outlying island
group of Penghu, moving westerly at 25 kph toward China, forecasters said,
adding that the CWB is expected to lift its land warning for Pabuk at around
noon.</P>
      <P>Although the tropical storm's influence on Taiwan's weather is diminishing, it
is likely to bring downpours to the eastern and northern parts of Taiwan as its
outer edge passes over the area, forecasters said.</P>
      <P>Between early Tuesday morning and 8 a.m. Wednesday, accumulated rainfall
registered 392 mm in Hualien City, 298 mm in Huayuan, Taitung County, 221 mm in

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Wednesday the government will continue working to
have fugitive Rebar Group founder Wang You-theng repatriated back to Taiwan
through legal means, in the wake of Wang's release from a holding center in the
United States.</P>
      <P>Chang said the concerned Taiwan authorities have had U.S. legal experts study
what actions Taiwan can take to achieve the goal.</P>
      <P>"We won't be discouraged and will do whatever we can on the matter, regardless
of what problems we face," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Bureau of Investigation officials said that they have not received
any official notification  from U.S.  authorities concerning Wang's release and
that they will monitor his whereabouts as soon as they obtain related
information.</P>
      <P>According to local media reports, Wang was released Tuesday from an immigration
holding center in San Pedro, California, where he had been held since Feb. 2.</P>
      <P>Wang was detained by U.S. immigration authorities when he tried to return to Los
Angeles with both his Republic of China and Dominican Republic passports
canceled, following a failed attempt to flee to Myanmar via Singapore.</P>
      <P>Wang is suspected of having embezzled billions of dollars in corporate funds
from the group before fleeing with his wife, Wang Chin She-ying, to China late
last year and then to the United States in January this year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan authorities placed the couple on the country's most-wanted list Jan. 15
and have been seeking U.S. assistance to have them repatriated back to Taiwan to
face charges.</P>
      <P>In March, Taiwanese prosecutors indicted Wang and 106 others involved in the
Rebar Group scandal on a long list of charges, including fraud, money laundering
and insider trading, and are seeking a prison sentence of 30 years and an
unprecedented fine of NT$1.71 billion (US$52.13 million) for Wang.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese symphonic black metal band ChthoniC has successfully promoted Taiwan,
particularly Taiwan's bid to join the international community, during its
current tour in the United States, the U.S. Public Broadcasting Service (PBS)
reported Aug. 2.</P>
      <P>In an exclusive interview on the PBS program Pacifictime, ChthoniC lead vocalist
Freddy Lin said that the band has spoken loudly for Taiwan's causes, mainly its
difficulties in joining international organizations due to Beijing's
obstruction, during the Ozzfest 2007.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, ChthoniC gave 20 performances at Ozzfest 2007, at the
invitation of Ozzy Osbourne, the lead singer of the pioneering heavy metal band
Black Sabbath, held in Santa Ana in Los Angeles and San Francisco last month.</P>
      <P>Lin said that ChthoniC has performed songs in both Mandarin and Taiwanese for
thousands of American fans and that he is not worried that these songs might not
be accepted by American fans, noting that heavy metal audiences pay more
attention to music rather lyrics.</P>
      <P>He emphasized, however, that the song "Unlimited Taiwan, " demonstrating the
unlimited potential of the island and its people, was performed in English in
order to better present the band's support for Taiwan's bid to join the United
Nations.</P>
      <P>He said he spoke out in English at every concert, asking fans to support Taiwan
as their music was inspired in and by the nation.</P>
      <P>Lin said he is not worried about the band being associated with politics. On the
contrary, he said the opportunity to raise Taiwan's profile in the international
community  would be a brand-new experience for Taiwan's music world.</P>
      <P>During the seven-minute interview, Lin said that the Ozzfest concert was just
part of the beginning of the group's "Unlimited World Tour" 2007, which will
involve more than 80 concerts around the world, including Germany's Wacken Open
Air festival -- the world's largest exclusively metal music festival -- as well
as a number of concerts around Asia.</P>
      <P>More than 1 million fans will be listening to ChthoniC's music and words on
Taiwan issues, Lin noted.</P>
      <P>During the Unlimited World Tour, Lin said, the group will promote Taiwan culture
and the country's concerns by distributing paper dolls, T-shirts and CDs, in
addition to playing music.</P>
      <P>The PBS interview is expected to be re-broadcast by 15 other PBS stations across
America over the following months, Lin said, adding that fans in Hong Kong and
southern China will also be able to catch the interview on channel Radio 3. The
interview can also be found online at www.kqed.org/pacifictime.</P>
      <P>The name "Chthonic" (pronounced THON-ick) is Greek for "of the Underworld." The
group's music focuses in part on the history of the Taiwanese people. Though the
band's image is reminiscent of the black metal legends of Scandinavia,
ChthoniC's use of corpse paint is inspired by the history of their own culture.
In Taiwanese folklore, deities known as the "Eight Generals" wear corpse paint
to become empowered with Taoist spirits that give them the power to judge good
and evil. It is this spirit that the band conveys on stage.</P>
      <P>ChthoniC has been pushing the boundaries throughout their career, and having
singlehandedly launched an extreme metal scene in their home country, the group
now sets their sights squarely on the rest of the world, according to a U.S.
critic.</P>

      <P>The new storm, named Wutip, was centered 430 km east-southeast of Taiwan as of

meteorologists said.</P>

      <P>Export and import values for July reached US$21.18 billion and US$20.73 billion,
respectively, both setting single-month records, a Ministry of Finance (MOF)
official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Export value marked an 8.2 percent year-on-year rise while imports rose 16.7
percent from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>With imports growing faster than exports, the country's trade surplus dropped 75
percent from the year-earlier level to a mere US$450 million for July, the
lowest since March 2006.</P>
      <P>Lee Li-hsue, director-general of the MOF's Statistics Department, said exports
of consumer products to Hong Kong, China and Europe all had annual growth rates
of more than 12 percent, which contributed to the high export value for the
month.</P>
      <P>The high import value was achieved thanks to increases of imports from the
Middle East, Europe, Hong Kong, China and America, at 36.2 percent, 27.2
percent, 17.5 percent, and 11.2 percent, respectively, Lee said, adding that a
large amount of naphtha imports also contributed to the total figure.</P>
      <P>Total export value from January to July hit US$135.12 billion, up 7.6 percent
over the same period of last year, owing to an increase of 7.8 percent in
exports to Asian countries and a 13 percent increase in exports to Europe.</P>
      <P>The total import value for the same period reached US$124.13 billion, an
increase of 7 percent year-on-year, giving Taiwan a trade surplus of US$10.99
billion for the first seven months, up 14.9 percent over the same period of last
year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday that he wants to further communicate
with the United States to resolve their differences on Taiwan's efforts to push
for a referendum on whether to apply to join the United Nations under the name
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Stressing that his "four noes" commitment to the United States will remain in
place in the remaining nine months of his term, Chen reiterated that unlike the
U.S., he does not think the referendum plan violates this commitment.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while receiving Randall Schriver, a former deputy
assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, who is visiting
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Chen claimed not to know what Washington finds wrong with
the referendum plan -- whether it is with the U.N. participation, with the use
of the name Taiwan or with the country's attempt to address the issue through a
referendum.</P>
      <P>Claiming that U.N. membership for Taiwan is the aspiration of the majority of
Taiwan's people, Chen told Schriver that 77 percent of the people support the
country's bid to join the United Nations.</P>
      <P>As to the use of the name Taiwan, Chen said not even the largest opposition
party -- the Kuomintang (KMT) -- has "dared" to openly oppose the move and that
the KMT-initiated referendum plan does not rule out using the name to join the
United Nations, either.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, using the name Taiwan does not mean changing the country's
official name, and the country has made the choice since the official title of
Republic of China is not accepted in the international arena.</P>
      <P>Compared with other names, such as Chinese Taipei and the Separate Customs
Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, which the country has used to
join international organizations, Taiwan is the most familiar, powerful and
beautiful name preferred by the majority of the country's population, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Despite the high thresholds that referendums are required to pass, various
political parties have put forth several referendum initiatives designed to be
held alongside next year's legislative elections  or presidential  election,
Chen said,  calling the development atestimony to Taiwan's democracy.</P>
      <P>Challenging the fairness of the U.S. policy of not supporting Taiwan's
membership in international organizations in which statehood is required, based
on its "one China" policy, Chen asked if any of the three U.S.-China communiques
mentions that "Taiwan is a province of the People's Republic of China" or
"recognizes" Taiwan as part of China.</P>
      <P>Chen said the issue is not addressed in Resolution 2758 adopted by the U.N.
General Assembly in 1971 either, although the world body has cited the
resolution as the basis of its rejection of Taiwan's membership application.</P>
      <P>Over the past few months, U.S. State Department officials have on a number of
occasions stated that the United States does not support Taiwan's membership in
international organizations that require statehood, including the United
Nations.</P>
      <P>Also, the officials have noted that the U.S. opposes any initiative  that
appears  designed  to change Taiwan's  status unilaterally, including the
referendum on whether to apply to join the United Nations under the name of
Taiwan, adding that such a plan would appear to run counter to Chen's repeated
commitments to Washington.</P>
      <P>Chen pledged during his 2000 and 2004 inaugural addresses that if China has no
intention of using force against Taiwan, he will not declare Taiwan
independence, will not change the official name of the country,  will  not
include  the "state-to-state"  concept  on cross-strait relations in the
Constitution and will not promote a referendum to change the cross-strait status
quo.</P>

Venezuela as well as the IBAF over the visa boycott "in real time, " adding that
their efforts will not stop until the baseball players reach the venue.</P>

to express the ruling party's indignation over the visa issue.</P>
      <P>Noting that Beijing has "put its political hand into the international sports

said the DPP lodges its strongest anger and protest to Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez.</P>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) legislative caucus also hosted a similar news
conference that same day in which Chou Shou-hsun, a deputy whip of the caucus,
called for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Sports Affairs Council to

    <HEADLINE>New method to extract key ingredient for cancer drugs developed</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  8  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Local agricultural researchers have developed a new and efficient technique to
extract a key ingredient of cancer drugs from a plant endemic only to Orchid
Island and Green Island, sources at the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture
(COA) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Ho Cheng-kuen, a researcher at the COA's Taiwan Forestry Research Institute,
said the plant -- nothapodytes nimmoniana -- was first discovered by Japanese
scientists more than two decades ago to contain a substance named camptothecin
that has proved effective against colon cancer.</P>
      <P>Since then, nothapodytes nimmoniana has been utilized in colon cancer drug
production, Ho added.</P>
      <P>Ho noted that however, the patents for a camptothecin-related drug --  Campto
--  have been held exclusively  by Japanese pharmaceutical companies, so that
even though the plant is endemic to Taiwan and local researchers have known the
effects of camptothecin, no further experiments could be done before the patent
rights expired.</P>
      <P>Ho explained that since the patent rights finally expire this year, the
institute has initiated several projects to improve the extraction and
production process that will help Taiwan biomedical manufacturers gain some edge
over the drug production.</P>
      <P>According to the institute, the new technique for camptothecin extraction is to
insert a specific kind of bacteria -- agrobacterium rhizogenes -- into the seeds
to double the growth rate of the plant's roots. The roots, containing 552 ppm to
1,555 ppm of camptothecin, are then cultivated in vitro and the camptothecin
released into the culture solution, giving 9.8 milligrams of camptothecin to
every liter of culture solution.</P>
      <P>The institute will adapt the technique to mass production and apply for Taiwan
patents for the related techniques, Ho noted.</P>

      <P>Hou's detention came one day after he was questioned by Nantou prosecutors who
suspected the vice minister of using his influence to help his cronies win bids
and receive contracts for several public works projects related to water
resources, river and reservoir dredging and cleanups in the central county.</P>
      <P>Over 200 prosecutors and investigation agents also searched 33 locations,

various construction companies, in search of evidence.</P>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Steve R. L. Chen said earlier the same day following a

      <P>According to an initial investigation, Hou might have been involved in the

his cronies in several public water resources and river management projects,
Chen said.</P>

      <P>Tibetan human rights advocates protested Wednesday over China's continuing
oppression of the autonomous zone, saying that the totalitarian state is not
qualified to host the Olympics, as China launched its one-year countdown to the
2008 Beijing Summer Olympics.</P>
      <P>"China has never stopped its social, political and religious oppression in
Tibet. Awarding China the 2008 Olympics is like handing it a license to kill in
the same way Nazi Germany was given the right to host the 1936 Berlin Olympics,
" according to Chou Mei-li, chairwoman of the Taiwan Friends of Tibet.</P>
      <P>On the same day that China launched its one-year countdown to the Olympics,
Taiwan wants and needs to be a part of a global coalition that supports Tibetan
human rights and condemns the Chinese regime, she said.</P>
      <P>"For the Chinese government, this is a symbolic moment to promote its Olympics
propaganda and to show an outer layer in fancy pictures of China and occupied
Tibet to the outside world. For Tibet and our worldwide supporters, Aug. 8, 2007
marks the beginning of a massive International Day of Action for Tibet, " said
Rinzin Tsering, chairman of the Taiwan Tibetan Welfare Association.</P>
      <P>Wednesday marked the 32nd day since 14 Tibetans began a hunger strike in the
Indian city of New Delhi July 8 in an effort to put pressure on China, said
Tsering.</P>
      <P>Yang urged Taiwanese corporations to reconsider their plans to sponsor the
Olympics and said Taiwan should not rule out the possibility of boycotting them
if China fails to improve its human rights record.</P>
      <P>A 16-year-old Buddhist nun was killed by People's Liberation Army soldiers on
the Tibet-Nepal border last year and the Chinese government  announced  that it
would  control  regulations  on reincarnation of Tibet's "Living Lamas." China
has also increased its military deployment in Lhasa, closed the China-Nepal
border and criticized India for allowing the hunger strike to take place, said
Khedroob Thondup, a member of the Tibetan government-in-exile.</P>
      <P>"Thus shows that China has no intention of improving the human rights situation
in Tibet at all, " he said.</P>

MOJ Department of Prosecutorial Affairs Director-General Chiang Huei-min
announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chiang said bribery is likely to occur soon, as the election is expected to be
even more fiercely contested than usual due to the adoption of asingle-member
constituency, two-vote electoral system that will see the number of legislative
seats halved.</P>

MOJ will ask people who are possible bribery targets to report any
irregularities.</P>
      <P>Anti-bribery and anti-violence teams of the Supreme Prosecutors Office and all

      <P>The Democratic Pacific Union (DPU) will hold its second assembly in Taipei Aug.
14-15, according to Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>Hailing the event as a major achievement in Taiwan's difficult diplomatic
situation,  Lu told a news conference held at the Presidential Office Tuesday
that President Chen Shui-bian will deliver a keynote speech at the opening
ceremony for the assembly, which will be attended by nearly 100 foreign guests
from 33 nations, including Nicaraguan Vice President Jaime Morales Carazo and
his predecessor,</P>
      <P>Founded in 2005, the DPU, an international body initiated and currently chaired
by Lu, aims at promoting "democracy, peace, and prosperity" in the Asian Pacific
region and the world.</P>
      <P>The DPU will also hold the second Pacific Congressional Caucus (PCC) meeting,
with over 40 parliamentary members expected to join the event, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, Lu went on, will preside over the
meeting to discuss how to use digital technology to carry out congressional
reforms.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Lu stressed that the DPU will form an alliance involving 15
domestic universities and 26 foreign ones, adding that presidents and vice
presidents of these 41 schools will exchange ideas on constructing a platform
for young students.</P>
      <P>The second assembly discussions will focus on three issues -- the new situation
in the Pacific Ocean after the 2008 Beijing Olympics Games, how to formulate
green policies in the era of global warming, and  how  to apply  Taiwan's
information  technology  to the digitalization of all DPU member countries.</P>
      <P>Calling for wider local media coverage of the event, Lu said the assembly is a
important diplomatic event in the midst of Taiwan's difficult situation in the
international arena.</P>
      <P>Asked how the DPU will be funded after she leaves office next year, Lu responded
that part of the union's funding currently comes from the union's 100 members
from the business sector, each of which donates NT$200,000 (US$6,060) per year.</P>
      <P>The DPU will also organize activities to raise funds every year, with the next
year's goal targeting at NT$10 million, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Lu added that as vice president, she cannot travel overseas freely, but if she
is elected as the chairwoman of the DPU again this year, Lu said that she will
organize more activities in other countries. Lu's vice presidential term will

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian fully supports promoting a "normal country" resolution
and believes that doing so will help boost the Democratic Progressive Party's
(DPP) chances in the coming legislative and presidential elections, DPP Chairman
Yu Shyi-kun said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Both Chen and Frank Hsieh, the DPP's presidential candidate, endorse crafting a
resolution on the party's commitment to "make Taiwan anormal country, "Yu told
reporters following the party's weekly Central Standing Committee meeting.</P>
      <P>Brushing aside a local media report that Chen and Hsieh had reservations about
promoting such a resolution, Yu said that the president fully backed such a move
after hearing his report Tuesday about a plan to put forward the statement for
party approval at its national congress slated for Sept. 30.</P>
      <P>Yu quoted Chen as complaining that the media presented twisted reports claiming
that he was reserved about promoting a "normal county" resolution.</P>
      <P>According to Yu, the president has expressed support for the draft resolution
every time that they have met in recent months since he began drafting the
motion early this year.</P>
      <P>In a meeting attended last week by ranking officials from the Presidential
Office, the Executive Yuan and the DPP, no one, neither Chen nor Hsieh, voiced
objections to such a resolution to underscore Taiwan's sovereignty and statehood
independent of China, Yu said, pointing out that "many reports in this regard
are inaccurate."</P>
      <P>The draft resolution must be approved by a nine-member panel in the DPP's
Central Standing Committee, the DPP Central Executive Committee and the party's
national congress to take effect, Yu said, noting that the draft resolution,
including its title, has yet to be fixed as currently there are two different
versions.</P>
      <P>The draft resolution actually serves as a means to pool wisdom and invite a wide
spectrum of valuable opinions to make a future, formal resolution more sound and
visionary, he said.</P>
      <P>The DPP chairman said Tuesday that he is poised to continue promoting the
"normal country" resolution as it is vital to help boost the party's chances in
next year's Jan. 12 legislative election and March 22 presidential poll.</P>
      <P>According to Yu, the "normal country" resolution will serve as an electoral
strategy and a means to solidify a consensus within the DPP to help encourage
party candidates to score a victory in the coming two key elections.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung said that the nine-member panel is slated to
hold a meeting next week to discuss the wording of the draft resolution for the
second time.</P>
      <P>The party's central also plans to hold seminars in northern, central and
southern regions to solicit and consolidate public opinion, according to Lin.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hsinchu County's Coast Guard brigade intercepted in seas off the outlying island
of Penghu a fishing boat attempting to smuggle more than 400,000 king grouper
fish fries to China, an officer of the Coast Guard Administration said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The boat, called "Feng Chuan Li, " also tried to smuggle two tons of frozen
threadfin perch together with king grouper fish fries, with a total market value
of over NT$10 million (US$303,000).</P>
      <P>King grouper,  or Epinephelus  lanceolatus,  is a high-end restaurant dish due
to its delicate and firm flesh. Taiwan's breeding technology is far ahead of
China's.</P>
      <P>According to the Coast Guard authorities, China might have been able to develop
its artificial cultivation technology at a low cost if the fish fries had been
smuggled there, and later sold the mature fish back to Taiwan at a very low
price, causing a huge impact on the local market, the officer said.</P>
      <P>In order to prevent Taiwan's king grouper breeding know-how from being stolen by
China, the prosecutors have confiscated the smuggled fish fries and are
investigating their source.</P>

      <P>A major Taiwanese baseball association called on the Venezuelan government
Wednesday to issue the country's teenage baseball players visas by Aug. 10 to
enable them to attend this year's World Youth Championship (WYC) slated to open
Aug. 16 in the South American nation.</P>
      <P>Richard Lin, executive secretary of the Chinese Taipei Baseball Association
(CTBA), said the Chinese Taipei baseball team is training in the central city of
Taichung prior to competing in the 13th WYC.</P>
      <P>However, foot-dragging by the Venezuelan authorities on visa issuance is making
it uncertain whether the team can attend the games, Lin added.</P>
      <P>As the two countries have no diplomatic ties, the host country has not accepted
visa applications from Taiwan since April, Lin noted, adding that the CTBA
commissioned travel agencies to handle visa applications for the players in mid-
April and has asked for assistance from officials of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs' Department of Central and South American Affairs and staff of Taiwan's
representative office in Caracas to help expedite the application procedures.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the CTBA has also several times requested the International Baseball
Federation (IBF), which runs the YUC, and the Venezuelan Association of
Baseball, to help with the visa problems, but has not received any answer, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>Lin voiced hope that the players will get their visas before Aug. 10 so that
they can make the trip.</P>
      <P>He attributed Venezuela's delay to political factors, adding that it is the
first time in nearly 10 years that a Taiwanese baseball team has been unable to
go abroad to compete due to political factors.</P>
      <P>Lin said the CTBA will demand an apology from the Venezuelan baseball
association and will lodge a protest with the IBF to request a formal
explanation if the Taiwanese team fails to attend the games.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Government Set for a Crackdown on Illegal Hiring

In a new effort to crack down on illegal immigrants, federal authorities are
expected to announce tough rules this week that would require employers to fire
workers who use false Social Security numbers.

Officials said the rules would be backed up by stepped-up raids on workplaces
across the country that employ illegal immigrants.

Wall Street Journal:How Courting Sheiks Slowed Violence in Iraq

To understand how the U.S. managed to bring relative calm to Iraq's unruly Anbar
province, it helps to pay a visit to Sheik Hamid Heiss's private compound.

On a recent morning, a 25-year-old Marine Corps lieutenant from Ohio stacked
$97,259 in cash in neat piles on Sheik Heiss's gilded tea table. The money paid
for food for the sheik's tribe and for two school renovation projects on which
the sheik himself is the lead contractor. Even the marble- floored meeting hall
where the cash was handed over reflects recent U.S. largesse: The Marines paid
Sheik Heiss and his family $127,175 to build it on his private compound.</TEXT>

      <P>Responding to local hog farmers' protests that the government might lift a ban
on ractopamine, a veterinary drug used in hog and cattle farming to boost growth
of lean meat, government officials said Wednesday that the government presently
has no plans to lift the ban.</P>
      <P>Cheng Hui-wen, director-general of the Bureau of Food Sanitation under the
Department of Health (DOH), and Cheng Chun-pin, a deputy section chief at the
Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine of the Council of
Agriculture (COA), made the remarks at a Legislative Yuan news conference called
by opposition People First Party (DPP) Legislator Tsai Sheng-chia amid ripples
arising from the issue.</P>
      <P>The use of the drug has become an issue of public concern since two shipments of
U.S. pork imports and some of pork farmed in southern Taiwan were recently found
to contain ractopamine residue, provoking concerns among local consumers.</P>
      <P>Although a minimum use of the veterinary drug is permitted in some countries,
such as the United States and Japan, it is banned in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tsai said he suspected that the DOH intends to lift the ban as a result of
pressure from their political superiors, and threatened to lead hog farmers to
stage a protest in front of the DOH if it turns a blind eye to a threat posed to
their livelihoods by insisting on lifting the ban to facilitate foreign imports.</P>
      <P>Cheng Hui-wen denied widespread speculation that superiors have pressed the DOH
to lift the ban and promised that the ban would only be eased when complementary
measures are put in place.</P>
      <P>Cheng Hui-wen said Tuesday that the DOH will not unilaterally decide to lift the
ban unless relevant government agencies, including the COA, also agrees to a
relaxation of the ban. He admitted that the DOH has commissioned academics to
thoroughly investigate the use of the drug, which is lawful in some 22
countries.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng Chun-pin, ractopamine remains banned in Taiwan and the
government has no plan for the time being to soften its stance on the issue.</P>

Baseball Federation (IBAF) World Youth Championships in Barquisimeto, Venezuela,
Aug. 17-26, even if the host country grants them visas for the event.</P>

championships there.</P>
      <P>The mayor added that for the sake of their own safety, the Taichung baseball
players, who obtained the right to represent the Asia-Pacific area in the world
championships,  should consider carefully whether they want to go to Venezuela

Wednesday.</P>

      <P>In addition to meeting with Taiwanese expatriates in major Southeast Asian

      <P>Noting that Taiwan, as an Asia-Pacific country, must play a peacemaker's role in

      <P>Continued sales of U.S. Harpoon missiles will help beef up Taiwan's deterrence
force, a Republic of China official stationed in Washington, D.C. said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The official made the remarks after the Defense Security and Cooperation Agency
(DSCA) under the U.S. Department of Defense said earlier the same day that it
has notified the Congress of the possible sale of 60 Harpoon Block II anti-ship
cruise missiles to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the sale is a subsequent deal following Taiwan's
procurement of F-16 jet fighters in the 1990s.</P>
      <P>The proposed deal, valued at an estimated US$125 million, will include 60 ABM-
84L missiles, 30 lugs for air-launched missiles and 50 kits to upgrade the AGM-
84G version of the missile to the AGM-84L, the DSCA said in a press release.</P>
      <P>The press statement further said the proposed sale will help improve the
security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability,
military balance and economic security in the region.</P>
      <P>The Harpoon can be launched from fighter aircraft, surface ships or submarines
to attack targets on land as well as at sea.</P>
      <P>"The 500-pound blast warhead delivers lethal firepower against a wide variety of
land-based targets, including coastal defense sites, surface-to-air missile
sites, exposed aircraft, port industrial facilities, ships in port," a Boeing
fact sheet said.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon statement noted that Taiwan has bought both air- and surface-
launched Harpoon missiles before.</P>
      <P>It said the sale was in keeping with the Taiwan Relations Act, which commits the
United States to providing Taiwan with "arms of a defensive character."</P>

      <P>Taiwan's stock transaction taxes for July set a record of NT$19.1 billion
(US$578 million) , surpassing the previous record of NT$19 billion for February
1990, a Ministry of Finance (MOF) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Quoting  statistics  released  by the  MOF,  Lee  Li-hsue, director-general of
the MOF's Department of Statistics, said July's figure showed an increase of
NT$13.4 billion over the same month of last year, up 232 percent. Lee attributed
the result to foreign investment inflow and a brisk stock market.</P>
      <P>Given the lower present transaction tax rate of 0.3 percent compared to the 0.6
percent of February 1990, and the higher amount of transaction taxes, July 's
stock market was extremely brisk, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The total transaction value for 22 trading days in July hit NT$4.95 trillion,
with average daily transaction value reaching NT$22.5 billion, both of which are
record figures.</P>
      <P>The over-the-counter transaction value for July topped NT$1.49 trillion, with
average daily transaction value amounting to NT$67.75 billion.</P>
      <P>Total stock transaction tax revenues for the first seven months hit NT$73.03
billion, an increase of NT$19.6 billion or up 36.7 percent from the year-earlier
level, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The expected stock transaction tax revenue for the whole year is projected at
NT$85.12 billion and the achievement rate has already reached 85.8 percent from

    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) threatened
Thursday to attempt to recall Yilan County Magistrate Lu Kuo-hua if he insists
on replacing the popular children's folkgame festival with a new activity.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-de from the northeastern county said the annual International
Children's Folklore and Folkgame Festival, one of the most popular summer
tourist attractions in Yilan since it started in 1996, should continue. He
further insisted that there be no change in the designation of the event.</P>
      <P>Chen made the statement after Lu announced a day earlier that his office will
unveil a plan for new summer activities for next year at the end of September,
which he guaranteed will not be smaller than the existing festival.</P>
      <P>Lu also said the phrase "children's folkgames" has restricted the event's
development and that there will be no new planned activities under that banner.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen claimed that the "children's folkgame festival" is widely
regarded as a "city brandname" that the county is proud of. The event should not
be closed for good "just because the magistrate is not willing to organize such
a big festival," Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, since Lu announced an end to the annual summer festival,
there have been increasing protests against the move from the industrial and
cultural sectors, as well as on the Internet. Many Internet users have even
joined in an online campaign to depose Lu, he claimed.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, 127 art and music troupes from 67 countries around the world
have performed in the festival since its 1996 inception. So far, it has been
visited by over 5 million people and has generated countless business benefits.</P>
      <P>The colorful and festive event is of profound significance in the fields of city
diplomacy, economic benefit and cultural arts, Chen claimed.</P>
      <P>Lu explained, however, that heavy losses incurred by the annual festival over
the past two years have made it necessary to bring down the curtain on the event
for good.</P>
      <P>Lu said the two-month festival has created a financial burden of around NT$50
million for the county government during each of the last two years, despite
efforts to curb costs.</P>

global information technology ratings recently, including an e-government survey

      <P>In his latest electronic letter, Chen praised Taiwanese students' good

U.S. Department of State and the International Schools CyberFair.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen added, Taiwan ranked second in an e-government survey

2005.</P>
      <P>Among other achievements, Taiwan's preparedness in becoming an information
society ranked third in a 2005 survey conducted by the World Economic Forum
(WEF), and its rating ranked seventh last year, behind only Singapore in Asia,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>He noted that an official document would take almost two months to "travel" from
the central government to local government agencies 10 years ago. However, the
process has been significantly streamlined in the Internet era, he said.</P>
      <P>Under the country's e-government campaign, the public can save time by paying
taxes via computer and can look at tourist spots via government webcams.</P>
      <P>The government will also present an "e-housekeeper" program in which citizens
can receive information from government agencies, including various kinds of
tax-paying information.</P>
      <P>The government is now working on "single-window" Web services through which the
government can pass information to entrepreneurs more efficiently, while private
enterprises can bid on government purchase projects or pay taxes, Chen added.</P>
      <P>In the Internet era, information technology represents the competitiveness of a
country and integrating information for the public has become a responsibility

      <P>Cardiologists from Taiwan and the United States have proved that mammalian
myocardia can be regenerated from stem cells or precursor cells, breaking a
longstanding hypothesis denying the possibility of such a cardiomyocyte renewal,
one of the researchers at Tainan-based National Cheng Kung University (NCKU)
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>However, the regeneration process is most perceivable only after heart injuries
such as myocardial infarction or pressure overload, and is much less helpful in
replenishing attrition by natural aging, Patrick C.H.  Hsieh of NCKU's Institute
of Clinical Medicine explained.</P>
      <P>The research report -- authored by Hsieh and members of Harvard Medical School
and Cincinnati Children's Hospital -- has been published online by the U.S.
science journal Nature Medicine, which will also publish the results in print in
its next issue.</P>
      <P>According to the paper,  researchers  first raised double- transgenic mice whose
cardiomyocytes carried green fluorescent proteins. Following that, they created
two scenarios for the subjects -- some of them stayed in the normal aging
process for one year, while the others were given deliberate heart injuries.</P>
      <P>In the first group, the percentage of green-tainted cardiomyocytes remained
unchanged after the period, indicating that stem or precursor cells did not
replace uninjured cardiomyocytes at a significant rate. For the second group,
however, the ratio of marked cells decreased by 6.2 percent to 15.3 percent
after injury, implying that stem or precursor cells had taken those positions.</P>
      <P>Even though the experiments  prove that myocardia  can be regenerated in
mammals, Hsieh estimated that it would take at least five to 10 years to adapt
such results to human testing.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has approved an Executive Yuan proposal not to raise
civil servants' pay in the next year, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Thursday.</P>
      <P>In response to journalists' questions while presiding over the opening of the
Taiwan Culinary Exhibition in Taipei, Chang confirmed reports earlier that day
that a pay rise for the country's 1 million- odd civil servants, teachers and
military personnel in the next year is out of the question.</P>
      <P>Chang said those sectors had raises in 2001 and 2005 with a combined hike of 6
percent, which is enough to counter the 5.6 percent inflation registered in the
last six years.</P>
      <P>Noting that a 3 percent raise would increase the government's annual outlay by
NT$20 billion (US$607.81 million), the premier said it will further strain the

      <P>A teenage Taiwanese girl who received a transplant of peripheral blood stem
cells donated by a donor from China last month is doing well after passing two
critical weeks at the Taipei Veterans General Hospital, medical sources said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The girl has not rejected  the transplant,  there  is no inflammation and the
cancer cells that were in her blood before the transplant are all gone, said
Chiu Tsung-chieh, a doctor at Taipei Veteran General Hospital's Blood and Tumor
Department.</P>
      <P>Chiu noted that although  the peripheral  blood stem cell transplant was
successful and that the patient can be discharged Aug. 11, they will need to
wait for some three months to see whether a severe rejection will occur.</P>
      <P>In addition to a possible severe rejection, recipients of peripheral blood stem
cell transplants need to be observed for one to two years to see whether chronic
rejection develops, Chiu added.</P>
      <P>The 15-year-old Taipei girl, who suffers from inherited anemia, was one of two
Taiwanese recipients of peripheral blood stem cells donated by two Chinese women
last month, thanks to the efforts of the Dao Pei Hospital in Beijing and
Taiwan's Tzu Chi Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Center.</P>
      <P>The other recipient, who received a similar transplant at Hualien Tzu Chi
Hospital in eastern Taiwan, was also reportedly doing fine after the operation.</P>
      <P>It marked the first case in which two Chinese citizens had donated peripheral
blood stem cells for two Taiwanese recipients.</P>
      <P>Several Taiwanese citizens have donated bone marrow to Chinese recipients over
the past several years under arrangements made by the Tzu Chi Bone Marrow and
Stem Cell Center.</P>
      <P>The Tzu Chi Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Center -- the largest of its kind in Asia
-- has built up a databank of nearly 300,000 bone marrow samples since its
inception in 1993 and has helped more than 300 victims of blood diseases to find
donors.</P>
      <P>The center now has access to data on more than 10 million donors worldwide after
linking up with two bone marrow data banks in the United States and Germany late
last year.</P>

      <P>Pottery shards unearthed recently from a prehistoric archaeological site in a
village in southern Matsu prove that history involving human activity in the
Taiwan-held island could date back to the late Tang Dynasty, Matsu officials in
charge of cultural affairs said Thursday.</P>
      <P>An archaeological team headed by Professor Chen Chung-yu of Academia Sinica's
Institute of History and Philology and sponsored by the Matsu County Bureau of
Cultural  Affairs embarked  on an archaeological mission throughout the five
Matsu islets June 12 and decided to begin excavations in Fucheng village on
Tungchu islet June 22.</P>
      <P>In a pile of discarded seashells that the team members excavated in the village,
they discovered tons of seashells, fish bones and pottery shards. Of these
items, they discovered a pottery eaves tile that was a product of the Southern
Sung period, between 420-479 A.D., according to the Matsu officials.</P>
      <P>Using carbon dating, the team members found that some of the pottery shards
unearthed from the Fucheng site could be shards of pots or bowls used by people
living in the Matsu area some 1,270 years ago.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Steve R. L. Chen said Thursday that the public
supports the government's floating oil pricing mechanism, even though it has
stirred up debate in society due to rising international oil prices.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while answering questions during a public hearing called
by ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmaker Wang Tu-fa at the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the conclusion was reached after his ministry thoroughly assessed
public opinion regarding the issue and added that most of the people surveyed
still back the floating oil pricing system despite the fact that further
adjustments may be needed to perfect it.</P>
      <P>Ascribing the increases in domestic consumer product prices to soaring
international crude oil prices and a "global bad crop" resulting  from  drastic
climate  changes,  he denied  public misconceptions that the recent wave of
product price hikes was driven by the floating oil pricing system, implemented
early this year.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, state-run CPC Corp. Taiwan Chairman Pan Wen-yen
contended that the floating oil pricing system more accurately reflects the
company's procurement costs. Taiwan relies completely on imported oil to meet
local energy demand.</P>
      <P>The company's expenditures for the whole of last year hit NT$800 billion
(US$24.2 billion), NT$500 billion of which was spent on crude oil procurement,
Pan reported.</P>

      <P>Financial proof for foreign spouses who intend to apply for Taiwanese
citizenship is indispensable, as it ensures their financial ability, Interior
Minister Lee Yi-yang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks in response to a protest by the Coalition Against Financial
Requirement for Immigrants that demanded the Executive Yuan lift regulations
requiring foreign spouses to provide proof of finances in order to get Taiwanese
identification card, as stipulated in both the Nationality Act and Immigration
Law.</P>
      <P>Other requirements include passing a medical check-up, staying in Taiwan for a
certain period of time, renouncing original nationality and passing a Chinese
proficiency exam, while the financial proof is considered the most difficult as
it requires the spouses family to submit financial proof of assets of about
NT$400,000 (US$12,120).</P>
      <P>The coalition comprises various civic groups, including the Labor Rights
Association and the Taiwan Association for Human Rights. It claims that the
regulations constitute class discrimination as it is an almost unreachable
standard for such families, in which the foreign spouses come mainly from
Southeast Asian countries and China.</P>
      <P>Lee expressed hope that the public will not "misunderstand" the purpose of the
regulation and said that the financial proof will ensure a family's financial
stability.</P>
      <P>Lee added that financial proof of assets is not the only choice as the families
can also submit proof that they have a household income that is double the
minimum wage set forth in the Labor Standards Law.</P>
      <P>He went on that a family without a household income of two minimum wages will
confront financial difficulties and will burden the society's social welfare
system.</P>
      <P>Countries  like Vietnam and South Korea also have similar regulations on
providing financial proof, Lee said.</P>

Taiwanese voters in the upcoming presidential and legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Ahead of his departure, Yu Shyi-kun said he will also inspect the operations of
DPP branch offices in that country during the trip and visit Philippine
politicians.</P>
      <P>Asked about disputes between the DPP and its political ally, the Taiwan

legislative election slated for Jan. 12, Yu said he will do his utmost to
cooperate with the TSU in an effort to push for a "pan-green camp" electoral
victory.</P>
      <P>The "pan-greens" referring to DPP and TSU members, must unite to win in the
upcoming battle, Yu underlined.</P>
      <P>On the Yilan county government's recent decision to close for good the annual
International Children's Folklore and Game Festival, Yu, who created the
festival in 1996 while serving as magistrate of the northeastern county, said he
feels regret and very sorry over the end of the event to which he gave birth.</P>
      <P>Yu described the annual event as a successful diplomatic strategy since it not
only attracted tourists and generated great economic benefits at home, but also
as a hit with the international community given its distinct cultural features.</P>
      <P>Calling on the local government to preserve the annual activity, Yu said the
event is not simply an entertaining activity, but also an activity with
educational and cultural functions.</P>
      <P>The festival, organized by the Yilan county government's Cultural Bureau every

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank
Hsieh has repeatedly said that he will announce his running mate by Aug. 15, two
DPP members called Thursday for an early formation of a ticket between Hsieh and
former Vice Premier Yeh Chu-lan.</P>
      <P>Lee Wen-chung, a well-known lawmaker who quit the DPP last year due to
dissatisfaction with a series of corruption scandals linked to President Chen
Shui-bian's family, said that a Hsieh-Yeh ticket should be put in place as
quickly as possible to solidify party unity in preparation for next year's March
22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Speaking to reporters at the Legislative Yuan, Lee said it is urgent that the
Hsieh-Yeh ticket be announced now that the other possible  running  mate,
former Premier  Su Tseng-chang,  has consistently showed no willingness to pair
up with Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Continued rehashing of the issue would only serve to further embarrass Su and
Yeh and erode Hsieh's chances in the coming presidential poll, Lee suggested.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Kao Chien-chih, a protege of Hsieh, also voiced his full backing
for a Hsieh-Yeh ticket. Whoever Hsieh's running mate ends up being, all party
members should do their utmost in the campaign, Kao said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh's aides said that he is scheduled to make public his choice of running
mate on the evening of Aug. 15 after he returns from a trip to Singapore and
Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yeh, who is currently visiting Singapore, criticized the main
opposition Kuomintang's presidential ticket formed by former party Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou and former Premier Vincent Siew during an interview Tuesday with the
Singaporean daily Lianhe Zaobao.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, the national economic development blueprint put forward by the
Ma-Siew ticket will not benefit the country, which is clear because the "cross-
Taiwan Strait common market" promoted by Siew lacks a "Taiwan-centric" notion.</P>
      <P>It is vital that anyone seeking to become the nation's leader, including Ma and
Siew, realize that their top priority after coming to power is to fully protect
Taiwan's independent sovereignty, she said.</P>
      <P>Without full statehood, Taiwan would sink to the same lowly status of Hong Kong,
which Yeh argued is not improved merely because the former British colony enjoys
brisk economic expansion.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's top representative to Japan called on the Japanese government Wednesday
to recognize Taiwan's statehood and to throw its support behind the country's
bid to join the United Nations under the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ko Se-kai, head of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in
Japan, made the call during an address in Tokyo on Taiwan's U.N. bid to nearly
200 Taiwanese expatriates.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the Taiwan government followed mainstream public opinion and launched
this year's U.N. bid under the name of Taiwan instead of the country's national
title -- the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>According to recent opinion polls, Hsu went on, 77 percent of Taiwan people
favor the use of the name Taiwan in the country's U.N. membership application.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon overstepped his authority and
"overinterpreted" U.N. Resolution 2758 in his recent rejection of President Chen
Shui-bian's two letters expressing Taiwan's intention to apply for membership of
the world body.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the resolution only stipulates that the People's Republic of China
(PRC) is the only legitimate representative government of China but does not say
that the PRC represents the people of Taiwan in the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Quoting the results of a poll conducted by Japanese media two years ago, Hsu
noted that more than 80 percent of the Japanese public backed Taiwan's U.N.
membership.</P>
      <P>Hsu slammed the spokesman of Japan's Foreign Ministry, who recently said Japan
does not recognize Taiwan as a country and opposes Taiwan's bid to join the
U.N., saying that such remarks are in conflict with Japanese public opinion.</P>
      <P>Describing Taiwan's latest U.N. application as a "practical move, " Hsu urged
the Japanese government to take into account its national interests and
recognize Taiwan as a country, as well as to support Taiwan's U.N. membership.</P>

      <P>In light of rising traffic fatalities involving bicycles, the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) is planning to amend a road law to
stipulate that cyclists must wear safety helmets while riding or face fines.</P>
      <P>In a MOTC meeting presided over by Minister Tsai Duei, officials from the MOTC
Road Safety Supervisory Committee said that fatalities resulting from traffic
accidents involving bicycles and cyclists have been high in recent years, and of
the people killed in these accidents, most have died from head injuries.</P>
      <P>This fact has prompted researchers from the MOTC Institute of Transportation to
propose an amendment to the road safety law to make safety helmets compulsory
while cycling, the officials said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the amendment will also require that left turns be conducted in two
steps by cyclists on the road, that cyclists ride within one meter of the side
of the road, and that bicycle makers be required to install lights and
reflecting panels on new bicycles, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>MOTC officials quoted tallies compiled by the National Police Administration  as
indicating  that between 2003-2006,  traffic accidents involving bicycles
resulted in 664 deaths and 7,131 injuries. Of the 664 deceased, 483 or 72
percent, died after being hit by a vehicle and falling.</P>
      <P>In 2006 alone, 183 cyclists died in traffic accidents, with 118 of the deceased
sustaining head injuries, the officials added.</P>
      <P>Researchers from the MOTC Institute of Transportation  are expected to come up
with a draft amendment to the current road safety law by the end of this year to
pave the way for implementation of stricter regulations for cyclists riding the
roads.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, MOTC officials said, beginning Sept. 1, cyclists in Taipei City who
run a red light or ride in the fast lanes reserved for automobiles will be
issued tickets.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China president should be allowed to make transit stops in the
United States and the transit issue should not be linked to other issues, a
former U.S. government official said in Taipei Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is a friendly government and a democracy, its leadership should be
received with respect and dignity. My personal opinion would be that Taiwan's
president should be allowed to be in the U.S. for transit and should be received
with all the respect he is due, " said Randall Schriver, a former deputy
assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs.</P>
      <P>However,  Schriver  admitted  that there is a tendency in Washington, D.C. to
use the transit issue as leverage in dealing with Taiwan-U.S. relations, adding
that "it's not healthy. But it does exist."</P>
      <P>Schriver  described  Taiwan-U.S.  relations  has more of a "troubleshooting"
relationship and encouraged the U.S. government to show more support for
Taiwan's democracy even though both sides have disagreed with each other on some
issues.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that there is frustration in Taiwan over the U.S. attitude and
responses to Taiwan's U.N. referendum plan and transit issues, among others,
Schriver said the U.S. should not be only critical of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, as a former U.S. official, Schriver said he can understand the
difficulties in managing trilateral relations among the United States, China and
Taiwan, as it requires "great attention and complexity of communication." Most
of the attention of senior U.S. officials has been shifted to the Middle East
and the war of terror in recent years, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>To some extent, the worst case scenario of Taiwan-U.S. relations will be that
either inattention or lack of interest among U.S. officials on the Taiwan issue
will make the U.S. unable or unwilling to support democracy in Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>In terms of the U.N. referendum,  Schriver said the U.S. government opposes the
content of the referendum rather than the referendum itself. The basic thinking
of the U.S. is that the referendum is unnecessary because "in the U.S., a topic
that is so popular and has the support of over 70 percent of the people does not
go to referendum."</P>
      <P>One of the keys, Schriver pointed out, will be how Taiwan's newly elected
president will deal with the result of the referendum, since it will be held on
the same day as the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Schriver works for Armitage International, a leading bipartisan study group that
plans to publish a report on Taiwan-U.S. relations in early 2008 to provide
references for the next U.S. administration.</P>

      <P>A test for the veterinary drug ractopamine in the blood serum and hair of pigs
from a ranch in Changhua County came back positive Thursday, animal health
officials in the central county said.</P>
      <P>This second round of tests on pigs from the farm, owned by Wu Tzai-wang in
Changhua County,  followed confirmation by health officials last month that some
pork produced at Wu's farm and sold in traditional  markets  around the country
was found to contain ractopamine.</P>
      <P>Kuo Chou-che, director of the Changhua county government's Animal Disease
Control Center, said Wu was prohibited from selling any of his more than 200
pigs in his ranch until next tests results came back negative.</P>
      <P>Kuo said some local farmers have taken to using ractopamine after being
convinced by animal feed additive traders that the ractopamine can boost growth
of lean meat in pigs.</P>
      <P>Currently, ractopamine is a legal additive in animal feed in more than 20
countries, but is banned in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The local use of ractopamine came to light in July after two shipments of pork
from the United States were found to contain residue of the veterinary drug,
which is legal in America.</P>
      <P>The issue caused a panic among consumers, with Department of Health (DOH)
officials having to assure the public that the government ban on the use of
ractopamine in pigs remains in place, and imports of pork containing residue of
the drug are still prohibited.</P>

executives after she read through a "normal country resolution" drafted by the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) central after being initiated by DPP
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun.</P>
      <P>Although several pro-independence organizations opined that the the DPP's
version broaching  a new national title and a new constitution for Taiwan is
"not radical enough" and have called for bolder moves, she said that any daring
advance toward Taiwan independence must be built on a national consensus due to
the country's delicate situation in international society.</P>
      <P>Before a national consensus concerning the point has been forged, it is
extremely important that the nation's leaders and key public office holders
refrain from precipitous acts that could put Taiwan's security under threat, she
said.</P>
      <P>However, the vice president is reluctant to comment on the DPP's draft
resolution designed to reaffirm the party's determination to develop Taiwan into
what the independence-leaning party calls a "normal country, "saying that in her
opinion, dealing with the country's present designation, the Republic of China,
is necessary, to allow Taiwan to shed its links to the People's Republic of
China -- Beijing's official title.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Police Agency (NPA) proposed Thursday that existing punishments for
drunken driving be raised to a higher level that would be more effective in
curbing offenses, a NPA officer said.</P>
      <P>Ho Kuo-jung, head of the NPA traffic division, said that the agency  has
proposed  at  a Ministry  of Transportation  and Communications meeting on
traffic safety that the criterion in determining an offense of drunken driving
be changed and the threshold limit of breath alcohol concentration be lowered
from 0.25 mg/L to 0.15 mg/L.</P>
      <P>The fine for an offense with a breath alcohol concentration of 0.25-0.55 mg/L
would be doubled to NT$30,000-NT$90,000, while the fine for an offense with a
breath alcohol concentration of between 0.15 mg/L and 0.25 mg/L be adjusted to
NT$3,000-NT$9,000, according to the NPA suggestions.</P>
      <P>Under the current statute governing road traffic management and punishment,  a
motorist  caught driving with a breath alcohol concentration of 0.25 mg/L or
higher faces a fine ranging between NT$15,000 and NT$60,000.</P>
      <P>Driving while intoxicated was the top culprit for deadly road traffic accidents
in Taiwan in the first six months of the year, responsible for one of every five
road traffic deaths during the period, according to NPA statistics.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's plan to stop over in the United States during his
Central America visit later this month is being arranged for the simple purpose
of transit only, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang said the major purpose of the
president's Central America trip is to take part in the sixth leadership summit
between Taiwan and its Central American allies, to be held in Honduras, and he
urged the media not to "focus all their attention on the transit plan."</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the heads of state of most of the invited allies will attend
the event in person.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a high-ranking MOFA official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
admitted that Taiwan's decision to push for a referendum on the U.N. issue
despite U.S. opposition has led Washington to adopt a less flexible attitude
toward Chen's request to stop over in the United States this time.</P>
      <P>Unlike in the past when the president always took part in some other private
activities during his transit stops in the United States, the president will try
to keep the transit stops simple this time and has not considered other possible
countries for transit stops, the official said.</P>
      <P>On Washington's disapproval of Taiwan's referendum plan, the government has
explained to U.S. officials that the plan is not based on Chen's personal
preferences but on the desire of the majority of the Taiwan people, he said.</P>
      <P>Also, the government has told U.S. officials that the referendum will allow the
international community to understand the strong determination of the Taiwan
people to join the United Nations, he added.</P>
      <P>There have been reports that Washington has refused to allow Chen to stop over
in the continental United States or stay overnight during the transit stops as a
way of showing its displeasure at Taiwan's plan to push for a referendum on
whether to apply to join the United Nations under the name of "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The Taiwan-based China Times said Friday that the president would consider
giving up his plan to stop over in the United States and instead make a transit
stop in another country if the U.S. government were to decide not to allow him
to set foot in the continental United States.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Chen's plane might fly over Africa and Europe, instead
of North America, on his way back to Taiwan, a plan which could involve a
stopover on the Dutch-held island of Curacao, located in the southern part of
the Caribbean Sea off the west coast of Venezuela.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, Cho Jung-tai, acting secretary-general of the
Presidential Office, said the United States remains the president's first
transit choice in terms of its geographical location, and he dismissed the
report as mere speculation.</P>
      <P>Also, Cho said he was not able to respond to many of the "hypothetical
questions" such as what if the U.S. government refuses to allow the president to
stop over in the continental United States.</P>
      <P>Cho said that President Chen is firm on protecting Taiwan's sovereignty and
dignity in negotiating with the United States on his transit plan and that he
believes this position will obtain the support of the United States and other
countries.</P>

      <P>The smooth conclusion of the 32nd World Congress of Master Tailors held in
Taipei has helped upgrade local fashion industry's international profile and
visibility, organizers said Friday.</P>
      <P>The congress, held Aug. 6-9 at the Taipei International Convention Center,
brought together 206 experienced tailors from 15 countries around the world to
show off their tailoring skills and fashion designs as well as exchange
professional knowledge, organizers said.</P>
      <P>Ho Liang-hung, chairman of the organizing committee of this year's committee,
said Taiwan won the bid to host the biennial conference after vigorous
competition from many countries, including Austria, America, and Thailand,
during the previous conference held in Berlin, Germany in 2005. The first
congress was held in Brussels, Belgium in 1910.</P>
      <P>The four-day event included a series of activities, such as Western suit
tailoring competitions and fashion shows, to provide an exchange platform for
the world's outstanding tailors, Ho said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan joined the federation in 2003 and was the third Asian country to host the
event after Japan, which held the event in Tokyo in 1964, and South Korea, which
hosted the event in Seoul in 1991, Ho said, adding that the event was a big
chance to bring Taiwan to the world stage.</P>
      <P>The organizing committee also invited many domestic designers to put on fashion
show to present Taiwan's vitality and creativity in the tailoring industry
Thursday, the last day of the event.</P>
      <P>Lin Kuo-chi, one of the participating domestic designers, said Taiwan's world-
class tailoring techniques to produce Western suits has been recognized around
the world, and that more exchanges with fashion design brands favored by young
people will help create more business opportunities with sectors of the industry
requiring high-standard craftsmanship.</P>
      <P>Classic brands such as Prada, YSL, and Burberry have successfully positioned
themselves at peak of fashion with product designs that better suit younger
generations' preferences, Lin said.</P>

data on real estate transaction price currently held by various government
agencies and private real estate brokers, CEPD officials said.</P>
      <P>According to officials, the lack of such a database has caused difficulties for
consumers, businesses, banking institutions and even government agencies trying

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has allocated NT$150 million (US$4.57
million)  to help small and medium-sized enterprises upgrade their technology,
MOEA officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>Officials from the MOEA's Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) said they are
hoping that within the next year, the program will help more than 650 small and
medium-sized  companies upgrade their technology with the benefits in terms of
increased productivity reaching NT$2 billion.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, a total of 685 companies have shown interest in
participating in the program, with two-thirds of them located in central and
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The program forms part of the government's efforts to better serve the central
and southern regions of the country, the middle and lower classes of society,
and small and medium-sized enterprises, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Currently, there are more than 1.2 million small and medium-sized companies
around Taiwan, accounting for 98 percent of all businesses in the country.</P>
      <P>According to IDB officials, manufacturing plants with capital of less than NT$80
million or fewer than 200 workers, as well as service companies with annual
turnover of less than NT$100 million or fewer than 50 employees can apply for
the short-term  technological assistance offered by the MOEA's 16 R&amp;D

      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) is studying new measures to further strengthen
its control on the quality of local universities, a ministry official said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Ho Chou-fei,  head of the ministry's Department of Higher Education, made the
remarks amid widespread concerns, including harsh remarks made by Vice President
Annette Lu earlier this week, regarding the low threshold for entering local
universities this year.</P>
      <P>Under current regulations, Ho said that if any domestic university fails to pass
a ministry review, then the number of students to be recruited by the school and
its tuition will be cut.</P>
      <P>The ministry will also cut subsidies for the school, Ho noted.</P>
      <P>In addition, such universities will not be allowed to recruit any students in
the following year if it fails the second review, Ho stressed.</P>
      <P>At present, the ministry is reviewing the regulations and hoping to further
tighten the quality control measures on universities, which Ho said will help
eliminate under-performing schools.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ho said that he does not believe that the quality of today's
university  students is lower than that in the past, describing Taiwanese
students' performances as "more creative" in the Academic Olympia contests in
recent years.</P>
      <P>Also, Ho said that decades ago, many senior high school students entered the job
market upon graduation because few of them were able to enter colleges.</P>
      <P>Today, with hugely increased number of college students, the four more years of
learning and training should improve their workplace performance, Ho went on.</P>

      <P>As vote-buying and bribe-taking have been rampant in Taiwan's elections, an

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged the people of Taiwan Friday to throw their
support behind the country's applications to join the United Nations and the
World Health Organizations (WHO) under the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen made the appeal while delivering a keynote speech at a meeting of Rotary
International District 3520 in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the government decided to use the name "Taiwan" to launch the
bids because the country can neither change its official title -- the Republic
of China -- nor use it in its bid to join the world organizations.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of recent polls, Chen noted that 95 percent of Taiwan's
people favor joining the U.N., while 77 percent back the country's bid to apply
for the U.N. membership under the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said that he insists on pursuing his mission of developing
Taiwanese identity, while safeguarding Taiwan from being downgraded as merely a
part of China or as a Chinese province.</P>
      <P>The people of Taiwan, Chen went on, can now resort to a referendum to express
themselves, which he claims will lead Beijing to better respect the choice of
the Taiwanese public on the future of cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Both the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) have launched campaigns to initiate a referendum on the
country's bid to enter the U.N., which Chen described as a "rare consensus" and
"a solid foundation for unity at home."</P>
      <P>Chen said that the government will soon launch new applications to become the
members of the two world bodies, and called on locals to actively respond and
support the applications.</P>

      <P>The government is planning to launch a product fair project in October that will
set up sales platforms in major cities and counties to promote products and
industries with local characteristics, a labor affairs official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Chairman Lu Tien-lin made the announcement during
a tour of Taichung, Changhua and Nantou counties in central Taiwan to gain a
better understanding of the difficulties in the implementation of a CLA-
sponsored employment promotion program.</P>
      <P>Lu said he found that a major problem for many industries is a lack of sales and
distribution channels and added that without proper outlets, many high-quality
products developed under the program fail to reach consumers.</P>
      <P>He noted that the government will integrate special industries that will receive
guidance from the Cabinet-level  Council of Agriculture, the CLA, the Council
for Cultural Affairs, the Council for Hakka Affairs and the Council of
Indigenous Peoples to take part in the fairs.</P>
      <P>He said that once the sales platforms are launched, they will not only help
special industries sell and distribute products and facilitate sustainable
development, but will also provide more purchase options for consumers and
create more jobs.</P>
      <P>He noted that the project is likely to kick off in October.</P>

      <P>Groups of hog producers from across the country staged a protest Friday in front
of the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH)  as they suspected that a ban on
ractopamine -- an animal drug that promotes the growth of lean meat in pigs and
cattle -- may soon be lifted.</P>
      <P>Hog farmers from across Taiwan demanded that the DOH not yield to pressure from
the United States and lift the ban on the veterinary drug so as to allow U.S.
pork containing the substance to enter Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The use of ractopamine has provoked local consumers' concern after two shipments
of imported pork from the United States and some locally raised pork from
central Taiwan were discovered last month to contain the drug, which is lawful
in the United States but banned in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to hog farmers, over 1,000 metric tons of imported U.S. pork are
awaiting entry to Taiwan in local ports -- entry conditional on the government
lifting the ban on ractopamine.</P>
      <P>Arguing that less than 1 percent of domestic farmers would use ractopamine in
raising their pigs, representatives of the local hog-raising industry demanded
the government not bow to U.S. pressure and criticized local pork importers as
"diffident, " evidenced by their fear of declaring the meat to customs
authorities.</P>
      <P>Yang Her-pei,  deputy chairman of the nation's hog-raisers association, accused
the DOH of turning a deaf ear to a request made some six months ago by local
farmers that foreign pork imports be examined to see whether they contain
ractopamine residue.</P>
      <P>He blamed  the DOH for failing  to invite local industry representatives to a
seminar it recently sponsored and questioned whether academics who spoke in
favor of the drug's use on the occasion represented vested interests.</P>
      <P>According to Changhua County pig-raising association chairman Yang Kuan-chang,
52 containers of U.S. pork, collectively worth more than US$50 million in market
value have been waiting since July 2 for the ban on ractopamine to be lifted so
as to receive clearance.</P>
      <P>Young Ju-men, an activist committed to bettering local farmers' livelihoods, who
was released from jail last month through a presidential pardon, also took part
in the protest.</P>
      <P>Shipments of U.S. pork detected to be ractopamine-tainted last month were
allegedly going to be sold to a "famous fast-food chain, " he said, expressing
his objections to an easing of the ban.</P>
      <P>Young was imprisoned for planting explosive devices in Taipei to arouse public
attention to the plight of local farmers after the opening of Taiwan's market to
foreign farm produce.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Ting-hung, deputy director-general of the DOH's Bureau of Food Sanitation,
confirmed that the DOH has for more than one month not received any customs
clearance report of imported pork. But he clarified that the Council of
Agriculture (COA) is the authority in charge of deciding whether to remove the
ban.</P>
      <P>The DOH will not apply two different standards to examinations of locally and
foreign produced pork, he said.</P>
      <P>DOH officials have repeatedly said that the DOH has no authority to unilaterally
lift the ban because such a move must be approved by the COA, which listed
ractopamine as a banned drug.</P>

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun, who is visiting
Manila, has been forced to cancel his plan to visit Thailand after the Thai
government denied him a visa, a spokesman of DPP's Southeast Asian chapter in
Bangkok said Friday.</P>
      <P>Yu was scheduled to proceed to Thailand Saturday after finishing his visit to
the Philippines, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, the Thai government's refusal to grant Yu a visa was
due to pressure from Beijing. He condemned China for its "arbitrary and
relentless" repression of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yu was originally planning to meet Taiwanese expatriates living in Thailand but
was forced to cancel his trip after receiving abrupt notice from Thailand's
Ministry of Foreign Affairs two days before his planned arrival that it would
not grant him a visa.</P>
      <P>The DPP spokesman said China imposed the pressure on Thailand on the grounds
that Yu is an advocate of Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Yu has been promoting ways to make Taiwan a "normal country, " including a
resolution within the party that will push for changing the country's official
title to "Taiwan" and formulating a new constitution more suitable for the
nation.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that although Yu could have applied for a landing visa to
enter Thailand, he refused to do so, deeming such a move "too demeaning" for
him.</P>

      <P>The Taipei Customs Office seized 2,990 video game discs from an import warehouse
this week and is trying to establish whether they are pirated goods, officials
from the office disclosed Friday.</P>
      <P>The officials said they chanced upon the suspicious goods, comprising 2,170
discs of Nintendo Wii games and 820 discs of Sony PlayStation 2 (PS2) games.</P>
      <P>They said the goods belong to an import company but did not name the company.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the 2,990 discs, with an estimated retail value of
NT$4.3 million, would seriously disturb the market and affect the rights of
lawful dealers.</P>
      <P>They said the customs office has asked the Criminal Investigation Division of
the Aviation Police Bureau to pursue the case.</P>
      <P>This is the third major find of suspected pirated video game discs in three
months. In July, the Taipei Customs Office seized 1,865 discs of Wii and PS2
video games. Aviation police later certified that the discs were counterfeit.</P>
      <P>In June, the Taipei Customs Office requested the help of a Nintendo

      <P>Lawmakers of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and its ally, the People First
Party (PFP), in the "pan-blue alliance" will cooperate to seek amendments to the
law governing street assembly and demonstrations in the next legislative
session, PFP legislative caucus chief Fu Kun-chi announced Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, Fu said that the two parties reached an agreement
to collaborate in pushing amendments to the Assembly and Parade Act after Tseng
Yung-chuan, a KMT lawmaker and director of the KMT's Policy Coordination
Committee, contacted him the previous night to seek the PFP's cooperation.</P>
      <P>Although the KMT's legislative caucus has repeatedly called for amendments to
the assembly law and the PFP's caucus has proposed that it be scrapped
altogether, Fu said that the two parties share the same idea of "doing
something" to the "evil law" in order to fully guarantee the assembly and
demonstration rights enshrined in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>He added that the two parties will also launch concerted moves to list the
amendment proposal as a priority issue on the agenda of the next legislative
session.</P>
      <P>According to Fu, the indictment by Taipei prosecutors of 16 prime organizers --
including former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Shih Ming-teh -- of
a series of anti-corruption protests held last autumn in front of the
Presidential Office and the Taipei Train Station was the main reason driving the
two parties to collaborate.</P>

county.</P>
      <P>The protesters included members of the county council and environmental
protection activists. They demonstrated outside the Taipei International
Convention Center and shouted slogans to express their opposition to the plan.</P>
      <P>Most of the protesters were residents of Wanli, Shihmen, Chinshan and Sanchih

      <P>Taiwan Power Co. has floated the proposal to build dry-storage facilities at
Nuclear Power Plant No. 1 in Shihmen township and at Nuclear Power Plant No. 2
in Wanli township to keep spent nuclear fuel rods.</P>
      <P>Chou said the plan will pose a hazard to the health of the residents of Taipei
County, while the township heads said it is unfair to residents of Taipei County
because three of Taiwan's four nuclear power plants are located in their county,
with the No. 4 plant -- still under construction -- in the county's Kungliao
township.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Environmental Protection Union Chairwoman Gloria Hsu demanded that the

      <P>Spent nuclear fuel rods -- a byproduct of the fission of uranium in commercial

      <P>The Yilan Prosecutors Office is dealing with the case involving the illegal
entry of a Chinese dissident, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Tung
Chen-yuan said Friday.</P>
      <P>Tung was referring to Cai Lujun, who arrived in Taiwan Aug. 5 by disguising
himself as a fishery worker and using his younger brother's name.</P>
      <P>Cai expressed his intention to seek political asylum through a local human
rights promotion association after arriving in a Chinese fishery workers
reception center in Nanfangao in Yilan County, northeastern Taiwan, Tung said.</P>
      <P>Through coordination, Tung said, the Fisheries Administration under the Council
of Agriculture and the Coast Guard Administration (CGA) handled the case in
accordance with the regulations.</P>
      <P>As Tsai violated the National Security Law and committed forgery, the CGA
transferred the case to the Yilan Prosecutors Office for further investigation,
Tung said.</P>
      <P>Noting that relevant agencies are checking Cai's background, Tung said that if
Cai's identity and testimony are verified,  the prosecution authorities are not
expected to indict him.</P>
      <P>After the conclusion of the judicial process, Tung said, the MAC customarily
calls a meeting of officials from all relevant government agencies, including
the Ministry of the Interior, to screen the case, ascertain Cai's true
aspirations and assist in arranging for him to travel to a third country and
help with his application for international refugee status with the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Taiwan, Tung went on, the government will give him proper
care.</P>
      <P>According to Tung, no Chinese dissidents who enter Taiwan via illegal channels
can obtain legal residency in Taiwan. At present, he said, the government is
arranging for four other Chinese dissidents who entered Taiwan illegally to
settle in a third country.</P>
      <P>As for Chinese dissidents who come to Taiwan through legal channels, Tung
continued, the government usually helps them secure permanent residency in
Taiwan so long as they meet the Interior Ministry's requirements.</P>
      <P>Tung said Taiwan does not have a comprehensive legal mechanism to handle refugee
issues and that the Interior Ministry has referred a draft refugee bill to the
Executive Yuan for approval.</P>
      <P>"Once the bill passes the legislature, we will have a more efficient mechanism
to deal with the issue," he added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is willing to negotiate on the issue of the 2008 Olympic torch relay
route with Beijing if it shows sincerity and goodwill, a Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) official said Friday.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Tung Chen-yuan made the remarks at a news conference in
response to a request by Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games
(BOCOG) Executive Vice President Jian Xiaoyu.</P>
      <P>Jian had expressed hope that Taiwan will return to a previous consensus reached
by two sides of the Taiwan Strait in order to let the flame's relay route
include Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan rejected a torch relay route offered by China in April that would have
included Taiwan as China's first "domestic" stop and would have had the flame
arriving in Taiwan from Vietnam and going on to China-controlled Hong Kong and
Macau.  The arrangement was considered by Taiwan as an intentional move to
downgrade Taiwan's sovereign status.</P>
      <P>Tung said that Taiwan rejected China's proposal because it violated a formal
agreement reached by both sides in 1989 that ensures Taiwan has equal sporting
status to China by referring to Taiwan as "Chinese Taipei." China has often
referred to Taiwan as "Taipei, China."</P>
      <P>He went on that the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee (CTOC), as a member of the
International Olympic Committee (IOC), has the right to participate in IOC
international sporting events on equal terms with other members.</P>
      <P>The 2008 Olympic torch relay is highly anticipated by the Taiwanese people and
the CTOC will contact Beijing on the issue in order to have a final decision on
the route made before the September deadline, Tung said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has several basic requirements for the negotiation, including that both
sides follow IOC regulations, that Beijing shall not downgrade Taiwan's
sovereignty and that the negotiation will benefit future interaction between the
two sides.</P>

a visit with a Taiwanese woman being held incommunicado on suspicion of killing
her three children in suburban Helsinki.</P>
      <P>Sheng Pei-huang  said that because  the woman has Finnish nationality, police

husband more than 10 years ago.</P>
      <P>Fu later divorced her husband,  who had custody of their eight-year-old  twin
daughters,  while  she had custody  of a one-year-old son. The twin daughters

    <HEADLINE>Lawyers protest court ruling of no need to subpoena president</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taipei District Court decision not to subpoena President Chen Shui-bian in the
trial of an embezzlement and forgery case involving first lady Wu Shu-jen and
the president's former and present aides is unconstitutional and absurd,  the
defendants' lawyers said Friday.</P>
      <P>The group of lawyers representing Ma Yung-cheng, a former head of Chen's office,
and his successor Lin Teh-hsun, asked the judges to subpoena Chen during a court
hearing July 27 to facilitate the investigations and protect the rights of the
two defendants.</P>
      <P>The panel of judges dealing with the case ruled Friday that as the points to be
verified in the trial of Ma and Lin on their roles in the case are clear, there
is no need to subpoena Chen.</P>
      <P>The judges also said court proceedings regarding the case will continue,
ignoring the defense lawyers' claim that the trial is illegal and
unconstitutional  according  to a constitutionality interpretation given by the
Council of Grand Justices in June.</P>
      <P>Ma and Lin are charged with forgery in the case involving alleged
misappropriation of a "special affairs fund" set aside for the president's
discretionary use, which includes funding confidential diplomatic missions.</P>
      <P>Their lawyers said Chen himself is the core figure in the case, as Ma and Lin
did not act according to their personal wills or independent legal status while
executing missions given by Chen.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the lawyers said only Chen himself can clarify certain
conflicting points and uncover the truth.</P>
      <P>As Chen enjoys constitutional immunity from prosecution, he has not been
indicted. However, the defense lawyers said the "bona fide" defendant in the
current trial is Chen himself.</P>
      <P>However, the panel of judges said the prosecutors didn't question the existence
of secret diplomatic missions. The trial of the case involving Ma and Lin only
touches on whether they had used other people's proofs of spending to claim
reinbursements from the "special affairs funds. As a result, the judges said
they see no need to subpoena the president.</P>
      <P>As to the defense lawyers' criticism that the judges have failed to respond to
Chen's request for return of a collection of files that prosecutors  have seized
from his office in the process  of investigations, the judges said the lawyers'
statement is unrelated with the lawsuit itself and will therefore not affect the
proceeding and judgment of the case.</P>
      <P>The defense lawyers slammed the judges for ignoring the grand justices' June 15
ruling that states that no criminal investigation, prosecution and trial with
the president as target is legally permissible.</P>
      <P>"The judges' insistence on going ahead with the trail is unconsitutional and
outrageous," said a defense lawyer.</P>
      <P>In their Friday ruling, the panel of judges said as whether or not the files
taken from the Presidential Office will be returned to Chen will not affect
court proceeding, the trial will continue.</P>
      <P>The judges still failed in their Friday ruling to respond to Chen's June 28
request for the court to return a collection of files taken away by prosecutors
from the Presidential Office for investigation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Prosecution dealing with illegal entry of Chinese dissident: MAC</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Yilan Prosecutors Office is dealing with the case involving the illegal
entry of a Chinese dissident, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Tung
Chen-yuan said Friday.</P>
      <P>Tung was referring to Cai Lujun, who arrived in Taiwan Aug. 5 by disguising
himself as a fishery worker and using his younger brother's name.</P>
      <P>Cai expressed his intention to seek political asylum through a local human
rights promotion association after arriving in a Chinese fishery workers
reception center in Nanfangao in Yilan County, northeastern Taiwan, Tung said.</P>
      <P>Through coordination, Tung said, the Fisheries Administration under the Council
of Agriculture and the Coast Guard Administration (CGA) handled the case in
accordance with the regulations.</P>
      <P>As Tsai violated the National Security Law and committed forgery, the CGA
transferred the case to the Yilan Prosecutors Office for further investigation,
Tung said.</P>
      <P>Noting that relevant agencies are checking Cai's background, Tung said that if
Cai's identity and testimony are verified,  the prosecution authorities are not
expected to indict him.</P>
      <P>After the conclusion of the judicial process, Tung said, the MAC customarily
calls a meeting of officials from all relevant government agencies, including
the Ministry of the Interior, to screen the case, ascertain Cai's true
aspirations and assist in arranging for him to travel to a third country and
help with his application for international refugee status with the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Taiwan, Tung went on, the government will give him proper
care.</P>
      <P>According to Tung, no Chinese dissidents who enter Taiwan via illegal channels
can obtain legal residency in Taiwan. At present, he said, the government is
arranging for four other Chinese dissidents who entered Taiwan illegally to
settle in a third country.</P>
      <P>As for Chinese dissidents who come to Taiwan through legal channels, Tung
continued, the government usually helps them secure permanent residency in
Taiwan so long as they meet the Interior Ministry's requirements.</P>
      <P>Tung said Taiwan does not have a comprehensive legal mechanism to handle refugee
issues and that the Interior Ministry has referred a draft refugee bill to the
Executive Yuan for approval.</P>
      <P>"Once the bill passes the legislature, we will have a more efficient mechanism
to deal with the issue," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan willing to negotiate Olympic torch relay with Beijing: MAC</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is willing to negotiate on the issue of the 2008 Olympic torch relay
route with Beijing if it shows sincerity and goodwill, a Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) official said Friday.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Tung Chen-yuan made the remarks at a news conference in
response to a request by Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games
(BOCOG) Executive Vice President Jian Xiaoyu.</P>
      <P>Jian had expressed hope that Taiwan will return to a previous consensus reached
by two sides of the Taiwan Strait in order to let the flame's relay route
include Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan rejected a torch relay route offered by China in April that would have
included Taiwan as China's first "domestic" stop and would have had the flame
arriving in Taiwan from Vietnam and going on to China-controlled Hong Kong and
Macau.  The arrangement was considered by Taiwan as an intentional move to
downgrade Taiwan's sovereign status.</P>
      <P>Tung said that Taiwan rejected China's proposal because it violated a formal
agreement reached by both sides in 1989 that ensures Taiwan has equal sporting
status to China by referring to Taiwan as "Chinese Taipei." China has often
referred to Taiwan as "Taipei, China."</P>
      <P>He went on that the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee (CTOC), as a member of the
International Olympic Committee (IOC), has the right to participate in IOC
international sporting events on equal terms with other members.</P>
      <P>The 2008 Olympic torch relay is highly anticipated by the Taiwanese people and
the CTOC will contact Beijing on the issue in order to have a final decision on
the route made before the September deadline, Tung said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has several basic requirements for the negotiation, including that both
sides follow IOC regulations, that Beijing shall not downgrade Taiwan's
sovereignty and that the negotiation will benefit future interaction between the
two sides.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will travel via Alaska on his way to Latin America and
on his way home, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>The officials  said that after negotiating  with the U.S. authorities, they
decided Chen's plane will make short refueling stops in Anchorage, Alaska on its
way to and from Latin America.</P>
      <P>The officials said the main purpose of Chen's visit is to take part in the sixth
leadershp summit between Taiwan and its Central American allies, to be held in
Honduras later this month.</P>
      <P>Since the visit is to cement relations with the nation's allies in the region in
the wake of the severing of diplomatic ties with Costa Rica in June, they said
that using Alaska as a refueling point is the easiest method of making the
journey.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's representative to Helsinki said Friday that he will continue to request
a visit with a Taiwanese woman being held incommunicado on suspicion of killing
her three children in suburban Helsinki.</P>
      <P>Sheng Pei-huang  said that because  the woman has Finnish nationality, police
declined his request to visit.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has traced her original residence in Kaohsiung,
southern Taiwan but has been unable to get in touch with her family there.</P>
      <P>Sheng said major media outlets in Finland have reported heavily on the tragic
killing since Sunday, although the media and Finnish police have not revealed a
motive or other details.</P>
      <P>He said the woman, identified only by her maiden name of Fu, married her Finnish
husband more than 10 years ago.</P>
      <P>Fu later divorced her husband,  who had custody of their eight-year-old  twin
daughters,  while  she had custody  of a one-year-old son. The twin daughters
were probably visiting the mother during their summer vacation.</P>
      <P>Sheng said Fu came with her children to Taiwanese expatriate activities during
this year's Dragon Boat Festival, which fell on June 19 this year.</P>
      <P>He said there are around 60 Taiwanese expatriates in Finland, most of them
Taiwanese women married to Finnish men and who usually have frequent exchanges
with each other. None of the other Taiwanese women questioned said they had
sensed anything abnormal about Fu recently.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will continue to communicate with the U.S. government over the
possibility of having fugitive Taiwanese tycoon Wang You-theng repatriated back
to Taiwan for trial, a Taiwan official said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to Stanley Kao, Taiwan's deputy representative to the United States,
U.S. authorities had notified Taiwan before Wang, founder of the Rebar Asia
Pacific Group, was released on bail from an immigration holding center in San
Pedro, Calif. early this week.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was also informed that legal proceedings in Wang's case have yet to be
concluded, which is the reason why he is required to wear an electronic
monitoring device after being released from the holding center, Kao said.</P>
      <P>However, Kao said the reason for Wang's release remains unclear to Taiwan,
adding that Taiwan officials will continue to seek an explanation from the U.S.
side.</P>
      <P>Wang had been detained by U.S. immigration authorities since Feb. 2 when he
tried to return to Los Angeles with both his Republic of China and Dominican
Republic passports canceled, following a failed attempt to flee to Myanmar via
Singapore.</P>
      <P>Wang is suspected of having embezzled billions of dollars in corporate funds
from the group before fleeing with his wife, Wang Chin She-ying, to China late
last year and then to the United States in January this year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan authorities placed the couple on the country's most-wanted list Jan. 15
and have been seeking U.S. assistance to have them repatriated back to Taiwan to
face charges.</P>
      <P>In March, Taiwanese prosecutors indicted Wang and 106 others involved in the
Rebar Group scandal on a long list of charges, including fraud, money laundering
and insider trading. They are seeking a prison sentence of 30 years and an
unprecedented fine of NT$1.71 billion (US$52.13 million) for Wang.</P>

      <P>Saudi Arabian officials completed a six-week training program in Taiwan that
gave them an opportunity to learn from Taiwan's expertise and experience in its
renowned National Health Insurance program, which Saudi Arabia intends to
introduce in the future.</P>
      <P>"Saudi Arabia selected Taiwan over Sweden and Germany as the place to send its
delegation because Taiwan boasts one of the best national insurance systems in
the world and because its population is about the same as that of Saudi Arabia,
" said Fahad Jalwi Lzahr, Saudi Arabia's director general of health insurance.</P>
      <P>Jalwi Lzahr led a 13-member delegation, including 12 health insurance officials
from provinces in Saudi Arabia, to attend the "Health Insurance Professional
Development Program for the Ministry of Health, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, " co-
organized by Taiwan's Institute for Information Industry (III) , Ministry of
Foreign Affairs,  Department of Health, and Bureau of National Health Insurance.</P>
      <P>The program, which concluded Aug. 9, aimed to introduce Taiwan's expertise and
technologies to familiarize Saudi delegates with policies, administration and
operational issues that are essential to the proposed implementation of the
Cooperative Health Insurance in Saudi Arabia.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's publicly funded health insurance program is similar to what we would
like to establish in Saudi Arabia, while the German program is more of an
outsourcing program that involves a lot of private companies, " Jalwi Lzahr
said.</P>
      <P>The program included lectures and discussions, as well as on-site visits to
organizations related to the topics covered. The lecture topics included
historical background, basic framework,  health insurance economics, health
insurance operations,  and hospital operations.</P>

      <P>Motorcycles with 550 cc engines or larger will be allowed to use expressways
around the country from Nov. 1, a Directorate General of Highways (DGH)
spokesman said Saturday.</P>
      <P>DGH Deputy  Director  General  Chen Chun-hsuing  made  the announcement in
Taipei at a gathering of motorcycle riders, who have for long complained about
not being allowed to use expressways.</P>
      <P>On the new policy, Ho Kuo-jung, head of the National Police Agency's traffic
division, said that most expressways will be open to heavy-duty motorcycles,
excluding the Pakuashan Tunnel on the Tai roadway No.76 which connects Changhua
and Nantou counties in central Taiwan,  and road sections  where local
governments  prohibit motorbikes.</P>
      <P>However,  motorcycles  will still be prohibited from using freeways, Ho noted.</P>
      <P>Starting Nov. 1, motorcycles with 550 cc engines or larger will be treated as
four-wheel cars which can use expressways and make direct left turns on roads,
Ho said, adding that such motorcycles should carry a red license plate with
white numbers on the front side of the vehicle to facilitate identification.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's export volume is expected to post double-digit growth for 2007 despite
the slowdown in growth momentum in the first half of the year, Bureau of Foreign
Trade (BOFT) officials said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The officials made the forecast based on the fact that the second half of each
year is usually the brisk season for Taiwan exports, especially consumer
electronic products.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Finance tallies show that the country's export volume rose 7.6
percent year-on-year to stand at US$135.12 billion for the first seven months of
this year, while import volume increased 7 percent year-on-year to US$1124.13
billion.</P>
      <P>This translates into a trade surplus of US$10.99 billion, up 14.9 percent
compared with the same period last year, according to the tallies.</P>
      <P>BOFT officials said Taiwan's exports did not perform as well as expected in the
first half of this year mainly because of the impact of the sluggish
international business climate.</P>
      <P>While  growth  in  Taiwan's  electronic,  information  and communication exports
slipped in the first half of this year owing to inventory adjustments by their
clients, demand was also declining in Taiwan's major export markets, including
the United States and Japan, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Due to the sluggishness of the contract chip-making industry, Taiwan's
semiconductor exports only increased 6 percent for the first half of this year,
they pointed out.</P>
      <P>Although the value of export orders received by Taiwan rose 12.8 percent for the
first half of this year, exports increased only 7.5 percent  because  46 percent
of the orders were for products manufactured in overseas production lines, they
noted.</P>

      <P>The Presidential Office dismissed reports Saturday that President Chen Shui-bian
has decided to nominate incumbent grand justice Lai In-jaw as the head of the
Judicial Yuan.</P>
      <P>Officials said the reports are "not true, " adding that the president is still
working on recruiting qualified people to fill vacant seats on the Council of
Grand Justices as well as the posts of Judicial Yuan president and vice
president.</P>
      <P>According to Saturday's Liberty Times, a local newspaper, Lai will be nominated
as the president of the Judicial Yuan, while Yang Jen-shou, head of the
Commission on the Disciplinary Sanctions of Functionaries, will serve as Lai's
deputy.</P>
      <P>Among the 15 seats on the Council of Grand Justices for which President Chen
nominated candidates in 2003, eight of them, including the post of president and
vice president of the Judicial Yuan, are for four-year terms, while the
remainder are for eight-year terms.</P>
      <P>However, as former Judicial Yuan Vice President Cheng Chung-mo resigned and Yang
left to serve as the head of the Commission on the Disciplinary Sanctions of
Functionaries, there are currently only 13 grand justices.</P>
      <P>Judicial Yuan President Weng Yueh-sheng, who concurrently serves as a grand
justice, as well as five other grand justices, namely Lin Yung-mo, Wang He-
hsiung, Yu Hsueh-ming, Tseng You-tien and Liao Yi-nan, will see their terms
expire this September.</P>
      <P>This is why the president has to put forward a list of eight grand justice
nominees to fill the vacancies.</P>
      <P>Other incumbent grand justices, including Lai, Hsu Pi-hu, Peng Feng-chih, Lin
Tze-yi, Hsu Tsung-li, Hsieh Tsai-chuan and Hsu Yu-hsiu, will see their terms
expire in September 2011.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said that it would not comment
on reports about Lai serving as the Judicial Yuan president.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yuan-chuan, executive director of the KMT Policy Committee, said that
President Chen has yet to send his list of grand justice nominees to the
Legislature Yuan for approval.</P>
      <P>Tseng said that reports about possible candidates are an attempt to sound out
the response of the public, and the KMT would "refrain from commenting on such
reports now."</P>
      <P>However, the People First Party (PFP) , an ally of the KMT, responded positively
to the idea of Lai serving as the Judicial Yuan president.</P>
      <P>Daniel Huang, executive director of the PFP's Policy Committee, noted that Lai
served as PFP Chairman James Soong's deputy during the latter's term as governor
of the now marginalized Taiwan Provincial Government.</P>
      <P>"If Lai is nominated by the president, the PFP will exercise the right of
confirmation after screening his qualification," Huang said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan had about 140,000 people with Alzheimer's disease as of the end of 2006,
and the figure could double in the next 20 years, a Taiwan Alzheimer's Disease
Association (TADA) official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Tang Li-yu, secretary-general of the TADA, made the prediction at a forum on the
Alzheimer's prevention and care.</P>
      <P>Alzheimer's is a neurodegenerative disease that, in its most common form, is
found in people over the age of 65. Clinical signs of the disease are
characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration, together  with  declining
physical  activity,  as  well  as neuropsychiatric symptoms or behavioral
changes. It is the most common type of dementia.</P>
      <P>To cope with the rapid increase in the number of people with Alzheimer's, Tang
called for efforts to facilitate early detection and treatment of the disease in
patients as well as concerted efforts by the government and private sectors in
caring for Alzheimer's patients.</P>
      <P>Although there is no cure for Alzheimer's, she said, there are steps that people
can take to minimize their chances of becoming victims of the disease.</P>
      <P>She noted that people with high blood pressure and diabetes are at higher risk
for Alzheimer's, adding that these people have to make greater efforts at
controlling their diets and exercising their body and mind more.</P>
      <P>In addition, she urged the government to spend more on raising awareness of
Alzheimer's, noting that many people with the disease have yet to diagnosed as
such.</P>
      <P>The association will hold an Alzheimer's awareness campaign on Sept. 15, ahead
of World Alzheimer's Day, which falls on Sept. 21, she added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Output of Taiwan's RFID industry to reach NT$10 billion by 2009</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The annual production value of Taiwan's radio frequency identification (RFID)
industry is expected to expand 12.5-fold over the next three years to amount to
NT$10 billion (US$303.95 million) by 2009, according to a report released
Saturday by the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>This will increase Taiwan's RFID production value to 4 percent of the world's
total, the report said.</P>
      <P>It pointed  out that  the RFID  technology,  an automatic identification method
that relies on storing and remotely retrieving data using devices called RFID
tags, is considered one of the 10 most important technologies of this century,
with more than 6,000 patent applications  having  been filed over the past 10
years  for RFID-related products.</P>
      <P>According to a report released by the U.S.-based ABI Research for the first
quarter of 2007, the global RFID market was valued at US$1.41 billion in 2006,
with the value expected to increase to US$5.1 billion in 2007, US$6.39 billion
in 2008 and further to US$11.5 billion in 2011.</P>
      <P>To promote the applications of RFID technology, the South Korean government
implemented six large-scale pilot RFID projects in the public sector in 2004 and
2005 and is set to funnel US$30 million per year during the 2005-2010 period to
boost the development of the RFID industry.</P>
      <P>As the development of Taiwan's RFID industry has seen a late start compared with
other countries, it is necessary for the government to work out a policy to
enhance the industry, according to the CEPD.</P>
      <P>A report published by the Institute for Information Industry last year shows
that there were 149 manufacturers of RFID products in Taiwan in 2006, with the
number of workers totalling 578 and combined production value amounting to
NT$814 million.</P>
      <P>While the electronic seal system used by Taiwan harbors is one of the most
innovative applications of RFID technology, a number of Taiwan businesses,
including Foxconn Technology Group, Mosel Vitelic Inc., Yuen Foong Yu Group,
Cheng Loong Corp. and Asia Smart Tag, are also developing RFID related products,
according to the CEPD.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Public functionaries from Kaohsiung geared up to lobby for a bigger share of the
central government budget for the southern port city while accompanying
President Chen Shui-bian on a community outreach tour Saturday.</P>
      <P>Braving heavy rains, President Chen and Vice President Annette Lu visited the
Taoist Pao-An Temple in downtown Kaohsiung at around noon where they received a
warm welcome from local residents.</P>
      <P>After praying for the god's blessing for the country and people's well-being,
Chen and Lu held a colloquium with local politicians from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>All of the elected officials and civil servants present at the meeting,
including two DPP legislators, Kuan Bi-ling and Lee Kun-tze, took the
opportunity to voice their opposition to the Executive Yuan's plan to have
Taipei County share the 43 percent of the government's tax revenues originally
set aside for Taipei and Kaohsiung municipalities from 2008.</P>
      <P>The Executive  Yuan  came  up with  the plan  after  the opposition-controlled
Legislative Yuan passed an amendment to the Law on Local Government Systems May
5 that makes Taipei County eligible for special municipality status, giving it
access to far greater budget resources.</P>
      <P>Lee said the proposal, if implemented, would result in a NT$11.1 billion cut
into the Kaohsiung City's budget allocation. Even though the Executive Yuan has
proposed appropriating an additional NT$7 billion for the city, Lee said the
amount is not enough to help the city government make ends meet.</P>
      <P>The outspoken lawmaker urged the central government to conduct a thorough review
of the existing budget allocation system and work out more plausible and
reasonable measures to resolve the controversy.</P>
      <P>If the central government  fails to deal with the budget allocation issue
properly, Lee said he is afraid that the DPP could lose the support of Kaohsiung
City residents and even those in other cities and counties in southern Taiwan
which has traditionally been the DPP's stronghold.</P>
      <P>Also present at the gathering were Kaohsiung City Councilors Kang Yu-cheng  and
Huang  Shu-mei,  Kaohsiung  City  Government Secretary-General  Hau Chien-sheng
and Bureau of Civil Affairs Director Su Li-chiun, as well as former Government
Information Office (GIO) Minister Pasuya Yao, who has announced his bid to run
for a legislative seat in Kaohsiung City in the next legislative elections
slated for Jan. 12, 2008.</P>
      <P>With a view to promoting balanced regional development, Yao urged President Chen
to see to it that the proposed new international television channel be
headquartered in Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>Incumbent GIO Minister Shieh Jhy-wey announced earlier this week that the
government plans to open an international TV outlet to help boost foreign
understanding of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Stressing that he fully supports the proposal, Yao said the new broadcasting
station should choose Kaohsiung as its home to help enhance the visibility of
southern Taiwan. For years, Taiwan's major news media have been concentrated in
northern Taiwan, particularly in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu met with President Chen at a lunch
gathering organized by a civic group, during which Chen Chu told the president
that the current budget allocation system should be completely overhauled,
instead of simply giving Taipei County a share of the tax revenues originally
designated for Taipei and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>"If Kaohsiung City's budget is abruptly cut by NT$11 billion, the city
government will have a hard time continuing its development projects and welfare
services for the disadvantaged, " Chen Chu was quoted as having told the
president.</P>
      <P>She even said that if the central government goes ahead with its allocation
plan, it would be a tall order for her to stump for DPP candidates in the 2008
legislative and presidential elections.</P>

      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) is studying the feasibility of
building another runway at the Wuliting Airport in Hengchun in the southernmost
Pingtung County, CAA Director General Billy K.C. Chang said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that during the winter, there are always strong winds in Hengchun,
creating uncertainty factors for the landing and taking off of airplanes.</P>
      <P>That is why the CAA is studying the feasibility of building another runway
perpendicular to the original one to help airplanes overcome the strong wind
problem.</P>
      <P>He said that the airport cost around NT$539 million (US$16.33 million) to build
and that initial estimates put the price tag for constructing another runway at
NT$1 billion (US$30.3 million).</P>
      <P>The money will be chiefly spent on the purchase of peripheral land and on
coordinating with the state-owned Taiwan Power Co. to shift a high-pressure
electric line underground, Chang said.</P>
      <P>CAA officials said that the Hengchun airport was inaugurated in January 2004 to
help relieve traffic congestion at the nearby Kengting Park during holiday
periods.</P>
      <P>Three airlines -- UNI Airways Corp., Trans Asia Airways and Mandarin Airlines --
originally offered flight services between Hengchun and Taipei and between
Taichung and Taitung daily, but because the air passenger occupancy rate
averaged less than 40 percent during the past two years, the number of flights
has gradually been cut.</P>
      <P>The CAA then coordinated to have Mandarin Airlines and Trans Asia Airways
withdraw from the Taipei-Hengchun route. From Aug. 10, only UNI Airways will ply
the route..</P>
      <P>UNI AIrways Chairman Su Hung-yi said that Hengchun Peninsula attracts 5 million
tourists every year, including many from Japan and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The airline is preparing to cooperate with operators of leisure activities to

      <P>St. Lucian acting Prime Minister Stephenson King will visit Taiwan in September
for the first time at the invitation of Taiwan's government, a Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>King assumed the post of acting prime minister in May after 82-year-old Prime
Minister John Compton was hospitalized in April.</P>
      <P>The Caribbean island nation resumed formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan on
May 1. It first established diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1984, before
switching diplomatic recognition to China in 1997.</P>
      <P>The official said the MOFA had originally planned for President Chen Shui-bian
to make a stopover in St. Lucia en route to Honduras to attend the sixth
leadership summit between Taiwan and its Central American allies to be held
later this month.</P>
      <P>The plan was canceled because of a lack of preparation time as St. Lucia has to
deal with its own political turmoil stemming from its prime minsters's health
problems, the official said, adding that Taiwan's ambassador to St. Lucia, Tom
Chou, only recently assumed his post and therefore would likely not have
sufficient time to arrange a proper reception for the president.</P>
      <P>According to the official, St. Lucia's ruling party is likely to hold a vote to
choose a new party chairman and Compton is likely to be elected party chairman
again. The focus will be who the first vice chairman will be as he could be
Compton's successor.</P>
      <P>As an alternative to the stopover plan, Taiwan's government invited King to
visit Taiwan to better cement bilateral relations, the official said.</P>

      <P>The increasing number of new immigrant families pose multilayer meanings to
Taiwan society as it represents a challenge, a must-do task to learn from
different cultures, and an opportunity for a brand new future, participants to a
seminar on new immigrant issues said Saturday.</P>
      <P>"The biggest challenge for any foreign spouse coming from Southeast Asia is the
language barrier. However, observations showed they picked up language quickly.
And, contrary to the conventional thinking, their children, being in a multi-
culture and multi-lingual family, are at an advantage, " said Tang Jing-lan,
chief executive officer of the Good Shepherd Sisters Taiwan, in a seminar
focused on international marriages.</P>
      <P>As of June 2007, the number of marriage migrants to Taiwan has surpassed
390,000, including 136,115 coming from Southeast Asian countries and 256,590
from China, according to a Ministry of Interior (MOI) statistics.</P>
      <P>There are still many stigmas to be eliminated in Taiwan about new immigrants,
for instance that most children with "foreign mothers" have learning
difficulties and growth retardation -- both false concepts that have been proven
incorrect by numerous surveys, said Edwin Yang, a professor at the College of
International Studies and Education for Overseas Chinese, National Taiwan Normal
University.</P>
      <P>In fact, Taiwan and Vietnam, where most foreign spouses came from, are both
countries with diverse cultures, which is why shouldn't be difficult for
Taiwanese to accept and learn from a different culture, Yang said.</P>
      <P>"We're now at a time of a global village and our generation will be citizens of
a global community who have to be always learning something new. I'm glad that
my children and I have the opportunity to learn from the Vietnamese culture, "
said Lin Jian-chung, who was married to a Vietnamese 10 years ago and have three
children. Lin is now a volunteer for Eden Social Welfare Foundation (ESWF).</P>
      <P>However, Lin said, the husbands and family members should also learn to help
their wives to adjust to a new environment, culture and language.</P>
      <P>The future of Taiwan will be at least slightly different because of new
immigrants, said Chien Ya-huei, who works for ESWF. The latest statistics showed
that 11.69% of babies born in Taiwan in 2006 were born into new immigrant
families.</P>
      <P>"It's possible that we will have legislators whose mothers are Vietnamese. And
our national policy will have to take care of people who came from new immigrant
families, " she said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Dispersing the homeless people who gather at the Taipei Railway Station will not
help solve the problem as they will surely return, a Taipei City Government
official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Shih Yi-ling, head of the Department of Social Welfare, also said that homeless
hanging out around the railway station and other transportation depots is a
common phenomenon around the world.</P>
      <P>The relevant authorities have the duty to maintain order by taking action, she
said, adding that her department will respect the decisions that they make in
carrying out their duties. However, she added that she is opposed to forceful
dispersal or imposition of a loitering ban as such measures would "create human
rights disputes."</P>
      <P>She made the remarks  one day after  the Taiwan  Railway Administration (TRA)
decided to take action against the homeless at the Taipei Railway Station so as
to maintain the station's image of being clean and orderly.</P>
      <P>TRA officials noted that the basement parking lots at the Taipei Railway
Stations are occupied by homeless people all year round, with some of the
homeless also using the restrooms in the station to do their laundry or bathe,
which they said has frightened some passengers.</P>
      <P>They added that there have been incidents of fire breaking out in the winter
time when the homeless build fires and huddle around them to keep warm.</P>
      <P>The TRA officials said Friday that Taipei station officials will disperse the
homeless at 7 a.m. and 5 p.m. daily and that after the last train departs at 12:
20 a.m. each night, there will be another clearing operation.</P>
      <P>Shih said that the department has coordinated with the TRA concerning the
homeless problem and has made its stance clear.</P>
      <P>"Dispersing the homeless is only a temporary solution as they are bound to
return as the experience of other countries has shown, " she said.</P>
      <P>She denied that the department has not been active in seeking a solution, saying
that it has sought cooperation with the TRA and has offered the homeless job
opportunities or provisional housing rent subsidies.</P>
      <P>She said that Taipei Railway Station is usually the place where people from
central and southern Taiwan looking for job opportunities in Taipei City first
arrive, adding that many of those who cannot find jobs immediately seek
temporary shelter at the station. She further said that with government
assistance, this group of homeless will be easier to handle.</P>
      <P>However, she admitted that some homeless don't expect the government to
interfere in their lives and that they have no intention of working or staying
in accommodations provided by the government, adding that this group of homeless
people is the most difficult to deal with.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun flew back to
Taiwan Saturday after concluding a three-day visit in the Philippines.</P>
      <P>Describing the trip as "fruitful, " Yu told CNA ahead of his departure for home
that he visited several influential Philippine politic leaders, met with DPP
supporters and Taiwanese expatriates living in the country, and inspected the
DPP branch chapter's operations here during the trip.</P>
      <P>In talks with representatives of Taiwanese expatriate groups and DPP supporters,
Yu said they all displayed determination in promoting Taiwan's efforts to become
a "normal country." He said they also promised to vote for the DPP and the
party's presidential candidate, Frank Hsieh, in the major elections slated to be
held in 2008.</P>
      <P>On party diplomacy, Yu said he visited the Philippine congress and the Liberal
Party headquarters in Manila. During the visits, he exchanged views with
influential Philippine politicians on a wide range  of  issues,  including
those  concerning  bilateral Taiwan-Philippine trade and economic relations,
regional security, trilateral United States-Japan-China ties, and Taiwan's
controversial plan to hold a referendum on its bid for U.N. membership under the
name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Most of the Philippine political heavyweights expressed concerns on issues
concerning the democratic movement and human rights in China, as well as on the
roles that the United States and Japan play in the Asia-Pacific region,
according to Yu.</P>
      <P>Yu was originally scheduled to proceed to Thailand Saturday after concluding his
visit in Manila. According to the DPP branch chapter in Manila, Yu had planned
to meet with Taiwanese expatriates in Thailand but was forced to cancel the
journey after receiving an abrupt notice from Thailand's Ministry of Foreign
Affairs two days before his planned arrival that it would not grant him a visa.</P>
      <P>The DPP chapter claimed that China pressured Thailand not to issue Yu a visa on
the grounds that he is an advocate of Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Speaking on Thailand's decision not to grant him a visa, Yu said he feels regret
over the decision. He also condemned China for its suppression of Taiwan in the
international arena.</P>
      <P>Yu has been promoting ways to make Taiwan a "normal country, " including a
resolution within the party that will push for changing the country's official
title from "Republic of China" to "Taiwan" and formulating a new constitution
more suitable for the nation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Frank Hsieh, presidential candidate of Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) , met with top Singaporean leaders Saturday for wide-ranging talks
at the start of his campaign tour of Southeast Asian nations.</P>
      <P>Hsieh and his campaign aides were whisked to Singaporean Prime Minister Lee
Hsien Loong's official residence for a luncheon upon their arrival at Changi
Airport.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Hsieh reportedly met with Singapore's Minister Mentor Lee Kuan
Yew, who is also Lee Hsien Loong's father.</P>
      <P>Hsieh would not confirm whether he did in fact meet with the two most
influential Singporean political figures, saying that he must respect the wishes
of his hosts who prefer to keep their meetings confidential. However, Hsieh's
campaign aides later confirmed that Hsieh had indeed met with both men.</P>
      <P>During an informal evening meeting with Taiwan journalists covering his current
Southeast Asian tour, Hsieh said he had "met with certain important old friends"
on his first day in Singapore.</P>
      <P>"I have not been here for 10 years. I'm delighted to meet with my old
Singaporean friends," Hsieh said, adding that he exchanged views with them on a
wide range of topics of mutual interest.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, their talks touched on Taiwan's elections, the development
of relations across the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan's policy toward cross-strait ties,
Singapore's role in the international arena, exploration of business
opportunities in the Middle East, Singapore's experience in waste water
treatment, and the city-state's opening to tourism-centered casino operations.</P>
      <P>On cross-strait relations, Hsieh said international friends tend to advocate
maintaining the current peaceful status quo. Noting that the key point in this
regard lies in the definition of the status quo, Hsieh said that the DPP defines
Taiwan's present status quo as an independent sovereign state and will strive to
safeguard this independent status quo.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Hsieh said Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) just advocates
maintaining the status quo and leaves open the question of Taiwan's future. It
is dangerous if the KMT's advocacy prevails. The KMT lacks a definite direction
and such a deficiency will hinder Taiwan's development and even spell a disaster
for Taiwan, he cautioned.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan needs to have a clear-cut national goal and definite
development direction as well as an awareness of its current place. "Our
strategy must comply with our direction and contribute to our goal, " Hsieh
said, adding that Taiwan must seek strategic security.</P>
      <P>If he is elected the next president, Hsieh said he relentlessly seek dialogue
and communications with China so that the international community, the Asia-
Pacific region and Taiwan society will feel ease without misgivings about the
possibility of a cross-strait conflict.</P>
      <P>"If elected, I'll also adopt a policy that favors openness toward cross-strait
trade and economic exchanges. Nevertheless, I will not compromise  our national
sovereignty  and dignity  under  any circumstances, " Hsieh said, adding that he
opposes the KMT's cross-strait common market overture.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he has also briefed Singaporean political bigwigs on his "Six Stars"
plan which concerns the division of Taiwan into six major regions, with each
region having the scale of one Singapore.</P>
      <P>"The plan is mainly aimed at facilitating resources sharing and enhancing our
country's competitiveness," Hsieh explained.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also met with Singaporean Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong to exchange views
on matters of mutual concern. In the evening, he visited Singapore's most famous
tourist spot -- the Santosa Island which will be developed into a recreational,
sightseeing, convention and gambling center.</P>
      <P>Hsieh's current campaign journey will also take him to Indonesia where he will
meet with Taiwanese expatriates to court their support for his presidential bid
as well as meet with Indonesian political heavyweights.</P>
      <P>Prior to his departure for Singapore, Hsieh said he is scheduled to return to
Taipei Aug. 15 in time to attend a carnival-style evening rally at 228 Peace
Park in down Taipei, during which he will formally announce who his running mate
will be.</P>
      <P>The Aug. 15 rally will be the first large-scale campaign forum since Hsieh wins
the party's candidacy for the 2008 presidential election. All DPP bigwigs,
including Premier Chang Chun-hsiung and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun, will be
present at the occasion to lend their support behind Hsieh's presidential bid
and underscore internal party unity.</P>
      <P>Speculation about Hsieh's running mate has been rife. While some party members
prefer to see Hsieh team up with his presidential primary rival -- former
Premier Su Tseng-chang, Hsieh himself reportedly would like to pick former Vice
Premier Yeh Chu-lan as his running mate.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 100 Indonesian spouses of Taiwan nationals celebrated the upcoming
Indonesian Independence Day with music, dance and Indonesian delicacies at an
immigrant services center in the southern port city of Kaohsiung Saturday.</P>
      <P>Indonesian Independence Day, which falls on Aug. 17, commemorates the end of
Japan's occupation of the country between 1942-45 during the final years of
World War II. Before the Japanese occupation, Indonesia  was under Dutch
colonial  rule for three-and-a-half centuries.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the municipal government's Social Affairs Bureau show
that there are more than 2,000 Indonesian spouses of Taiwanese citizens in the
southern port city, with many living in the city's Chichin, Hsiaokang and
Chienchen districts.</P>
      <P>An Indonesian spouse taking part in the celebration  said Indonesian
Independence Day is as important to Indonesians as Lunar New Year's Day is to
the people of Taiwan. She said that patriotic celebrations begin weeks before
Aug. 17 and that the national flag can be seen everywhere in the country during
this period.</P>
      <P>She said that many of the Indonesian spouses living in Kaohsiung miss their home
country and the Independence Day activities and therefore decided to hold the
celebration to feel less homesick and have a good time.</P>
      <P>Wu Chiou-o,  chairwoman of a club for Indonesian spouses, expressed the hope
that these kinds of activities would also allow Taiwan nationals to gain a
better understanding of the cultures of many of Taiwan's new immigrants.</P>
      <P>In the celebration, participants also conveyed their affection for Taiwan by
reading loving declarations and expressing the hope of assimilating into local
society.</P>

      <P>Three family members of a Taiwanese woman being held incommunicado on suspicion
of killing her three children in suburban Helsinki will travel to Finland Monday
to assist in legal proceedings and other affairs, family sources said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The woman's father, uncle and younger brother will fly to Finland to help with
handling of the aftermath, the sources said, adding that they will retain
lawyers to defend the woman, identified only by her maiden name of Fu.</P>
      <P>Fu's father said he was shocked by the tragedy, saying he couldn't believe that
his daughter who had pursued advanced study in Britain had committed the alleged
crime.</P>
      <P>According to her family, Fu worked at a Finnish postal office and maintained
close contact with her family in Kaohsiung City's Autzuti district in southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Her father  said Fu often  chatted  with him over phone. Nevertheless, he said
Fu had never told any family member that she had frequently fallen victim to
domestic violence and was subject to protection and observation of a Finnish
social counseling agency.</P>
      <P>"My daughter was a brave and strong-willed woman. She never mentioned any woeful
things in her daily life. We didn't know her distressing plight until a Finnish
pastor contacted us after the tragic incident," said the senior Fu.</P>
      <P>He recalled that Fu divorced her husband in March 2006. While Fu secured the
custody of their 1-year-old son, the guardianship of their 8-year-old twin
daughters went to their father. Fu could only get together with her twin
daughters on weekends.</P>
      <P>Fu's divorced husband reportedly had often banned the twin daughters from
visiting their mother and had taken away the passports of Fu and their three
young children.</P>
      <P>Sheng Pei-huang, Taiwan's representative to Helsinki, said Friday that Finnish
police have rejected his repeated request to visit Fu because she has Finnish
nationality.</P>
      <P>According to Sheng, major Finnish media outlets have given prominent coverage of
the tragic killing since last Sunday, although the media and Finnish police have
not revealed the motivation or other details.</P>
      <P>To the best of his understanding, Sheng said Fu married her Finnish husband more
than 10 years ago and that she came with her children to Taiwanese expatriate
activities during this year's Dragon Boat Festival, which fell on June 19 this
year.</P>
      <P>There are around 60 Taiwanese expatriates in Finland, most of whom are Taiwanese
women married to Finnish men and who usually have frequent exchanges with each
other.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan will unveil various plausible options in the coming few days
in an effort to resolve the controversy  surrounding  budget allocations  among
municipality governments, Cabinet spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Shieh made the remarks after the China Times, a local daily, reported earlier
the same day that Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu will refuse to stump for ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidates in the next legislative and
presidential  elections scheduled for early next year in protest against a
Cabinet proposal to have Taipei County share 43 percent of the government's tax
revenues  originally  set  aside  for  Taipei  and  Kaohsiung municipalities.</P>
      <P>An Executive Yuan panel came up with the proposal earlier this week after the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan passed an amendment to the Law on Local
Government Systems May 5 that makes Taipei County eligible for special
municipality status, giving it access to far greater budget resources.</P>
      <P>According to the newspaper report, the Kaohsiung city government will see an
NT$11 billion cut into its 2008 budget if the proposal is indeed implemented,
causing Chen to worry about the city's finances.</P>
      <P>After talking with Chen's aides, Shieh said the mayor was not intending to use
her refusal to campaign for DPP candidates as a leverage to pressure the
Executive Yuan not to cut the southern port city's budget allocation.</P>
      <P>"What the mayor said was that the planned budget cut would make it difficult for
her to woo Kaohsiung residents' support for DPP candidates," Shieh said.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, he went on, it remains uncertain whether the proposal for
Taipei County to share 43 percent of the government's tax revenues originally
designated for the country's two special municipalities.</P>
      <P>"Relevant government agencies are still mulling feasible measures based on each
administrative district's practical demand or special needs, "Shieh said, adding
that in the long run, the current law governing allocation of tax revenues among
local governments will be amended to meet the new national situation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Family members to travel to Finland to help murder suspect</HEADLINE>

      <P>Three family members of a Taiwanese woman being held incommunicado on suspicion
of killing her three children in suburban Helsinki will travel to Finland Monday
to assist in legal proceedings and other affairs, family sources said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The woman's father, uncle and younger brother will fly to Finland to help with
handling of the aftermath, the sources said, adding that they will retain
lawyers to defend the woman, identified only by her maiden name of Fu.</P>
      <P>Fu's father said he was shocked by the tragedy, saying he couldn't believe that
his daughter who had pursued advanced study in Britain had committed the alleged
crime.</P>
      <P>According to her family, Fu worked at a Finnish postal office and maintained
close contact with her family in Kaohsiung City's Autzuti district in southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Her father  said Fu often  chatted  with him over phone. Nevertheless, he said
Fu had never told any family member that she had frequently fallen victim to
domestic violence and was subject to protection and observation of a Finnish
social counseling agency.</P>
      <P>"My daughter was a brave and strong-willed woman. She never mentioned any woeful
things in her daily life. We didn't know her distressing plight until a Finnish
pastor contacted us after the tragic incident," said the senior Fu.</P>
      <P>He recalled that Fu divorced her husband in March 2006. While Fu secured the
custody of their 1-year-old son, the guardianship of their 8-year-old twin
daughters went to their father. Fu could only get together with her twin
daughters on weekends.</P>
      <P>Fu's divorced husband reportedly had often banned the twin daughters from
visiting their mother and had taken away the passports of Fu and their three
young children.</P>
      <P>Sheng Pei-huang, Taiwan's representative to Helsinki, said Friday that Finnish
police have rejected his repeated request to visit Fu because she has Finnish
nationality.</P>
      <P>According to Sheng, major Finnish media outlets have given prominent coverage of
the tragic killing since last Sunday, although the media and Finnish police have
not revealed the motivation or other details.</P>
      <P>To the best of his understanding, Sheng said Fu married her Finnish husband more
than 10 years ago and that she came with her children to Taiwanese expatriate
activities during this year's Dragon Boat Festival, which fell on June 19 this
year.</P>
      <P>There are around 60 Taiwanese expatriates in Finland, most of whom are Taiwanese
women married to Finnish men and who usually have frequent exchanges with each
other.</P>

      <P>The second assembly of the Democratic Pacific Union (DPU) , an international
body aimed at promoting "democracy, peace, and prosperity" in the Asian Pacific
region and the world, is scheduled to take place in Taipei Aug. 14-15.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu, founder and chairwoman of the DPU, said that a DPU
board meeting will be held Monday, when a new chairman or chairwoman of the
union is expected to be elected to lead DPU operations and activities for the
next two years.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian is expected to deliver a keynote speech at the opening
ceremony Tuesday for the assembly, which will be attended by nearly 100 foreign
guests from 33 nations, including Nicaraguan Vice President Jaime Morales
Carazo.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the DPU will also convene  the second Pacific Congressional Caucus
meeting Monday, with Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng presiding over the
meeting to discuss how to use digital technology to carry out congressional
reforms.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Lu said, another meeting is also slated for Monday on the DPU's
forming an alliance, involving 15 domestic universities and 26 foreign ones, to
serve as a platform for faculty and students from these 41 varsities to swap
ideas and strengthen academic exchanges.</P>
      <P>Discussions of the second DPU assembly are expected to focus on three issues --
the new situation in the Pacific Ocean area after the 2008 Beijing Olympics
Games; how to formulate green energy policies in the era of global warming; and
how to apply Taiwan's information technology to the digitization of all DPU
member countries.</P>
      <P>Calling for wider local media coverage of the event, Lu said the assembly is an
important diplomatic event at a time when Taiwan is facing a difficult situation

      <P>Lu added that if she is elected as the chairwoman of the DPU again this year,
she will organize more activities in other countries.</P>
      <P>Lu had played an instrumental role in bringing about the establishment of the

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan Water Corp. trying to relieve Penghu's water shortage</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-run Taiwan Water Corp. is working on emergency plans to relieve the
imminent water shortage facing residents of the outlying Penghu island group.</P>
      <P>Penghu's demand for fresh water has increased in recent years as a result of
booming tourism.</P>
      <P>The two tropical storms -- Pabuk and Wutip -- that passed over Taiwan last week
have effectively ended the drought in eastern Taiwan and replenished reservoirs
in most parts of Taiwan proper, but have failed to alleviate the water shortage
in Penghu.</P>
      <P>Penghu's three reservoirs currently have only 64,000 metric tons of water left.
With water being pumped out at a rate of 5,000 tons a day, that amount could
last barely two weeks.</P>
      <P>The Water Resources Agency of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has instructed
Taiwan Water Corp. to work out emergency plans to ensure that water supply to
Penghu will not be disrupted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Water Corp. has indicated it is working on a plan to ship 6,000 metric
tons of water from Taiwan to Penghu twice every three days from Aug. 15. The
company will try to find a company willing to undertake the job for a fee
through a second tender after its first tender failed to attract interested
bidders last week.</P>
      <P>If the second tender again fails to find a successful bidder, Taiwan Water Corp.
will resort to a backup plan to pump underground water from selected wells that
have not yet been salinized, senior officials of the company said.</P>
      <P>Penghu now has three sea water desalination plants and five well water
desalination plants, with a total water output of 17,980 metric tons, which can
meet about half of Penghu's normal water needs.</P>
      <P>The government is building two additional sea water desalination plants in
Makung and Hsiyu, and when completed by the end of this year, they will produce
5,500 tons and 750 tons of fresh water daily respectively.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) presidential candidate Frank Hsieh
reiterated Sunday that if former Premier Su Tseng-chang agrees, he is positive
that the DPP will field a Hsieh-Su ticket for Taiwan's hotly-contested 2008
presidential race.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who is currently visiting Singapore and is scheduled to return to Taipei
Aug. 15 to announce his choice of running mate, said that he recently extended
an invitation to Su to serve as his running mate and has also visited Su's
family, but until Sunday, he said, he has not heard an answer from Su.</P>
      <P>Hsieh will be returning to Taipei Wednesday, in time to attend a carnival-style
evening rally at 228 Peace Park in down Taipei, during which he will formally
announce his choice of running mate.</P>
      <P>Speculation about Hsieh's choice of running mate has been rife. While some DPP
party members prefer to see Hsieh team up with Su, Hsieh himself reportedly
would like to pick former Vice Premier Yeh Chu-lan, a woman who is devotedly
supported by the country's Hakka people.</P>
      <P>Also on Sunday, a DPP lawmaker urged Hsieh from Taipei to act "in all sincerity"
if he is determined to choose Su his running mate for the 2008 race.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Wu Ping-jui said that if a Hsieh-Su ticket is to be formed, Hsieh
should demonstrate the greatest possible sincerity because Su is a statesman who
would consent to decisions taken to best serve the DPP's and the country's
interests and would not insist on his own stance.</P>
      <P>A cable television channel reported Sunday that Su, currently in the United
States on a private visit, will probably decide whether or not to prepare to
return to Taiwan these two days as Hsieh is expected to announce Aug. 15 whether
he will pick Yeh or Su -- his presidential primary rival -- as his running mate.</P>
      <P>Su's aides in his Taipei office, however, denied the TV report, saying that they
have not been informed of anything of the sort.</P>

      <P>Washington is urging the U. N. Secretariat to correct its statement that Taiwan
is part of the territory of the People's Republic of China (PROC) , a Republic
of China (ROC) diplomat posted to Washington said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Huang Wei-feng, ROC deputy representative to the United States told a group of
Taiwanese living in the United States that Washington will keep prodding the
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to correct his statement made in March in a
letter denying Taiwan's request to join the U.N. Convention on the Elimination
of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.</P>
      <P>In that letter to Nauru's U.N. ambassador who relayed Taiwan's above request,
Ban said Taiwan is part of PROC's territory, citing the resolution 2758 of the
U.N. General Assembly in 1971.</P>
      <P>Huang rebutted the U.N. chief's statement, saying that the resolution 2758
simply acknowledged the PROC as the sole legitimate government of China and gave
it China's seat in the United Nations.</P>
      <P>He said that Ban had made a great mistake by thinking that resolution having
accepted China's claim over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This misunderstanding, if left uncorrected in U.N. official correspondence, will
hinder Taiwan's efforts to join international organizations as a state with
sovereignty, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The United States which only acknowledges China's claim that Taiwan is part of
its territory didn't see eye to eye with Ban on this issue and was pushing the

    <HEADLINE>Washington urging U.N. to correct statement about Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington is urging the U. N. Secretariat to correct its statement that Taiwan
is part of the territory of the People's Republic of China (PROC) , a Republic
of China (ROC) diplomat posted to Washington said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Huang Wei-feng, ROC deputy representative to the United States told a group of
Taiwanese living in the United States that Washington will keep prodding the
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to correct his statement made in March in a
letter denying Taiwan's request to join the U.N. Convention on the Elimination
of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.</P>
      <P>In that letter to Nauru's U.N. ambassador who relayed Taiwan's above request,
Ban said Taiwan is part of PROC's territory, citing the resolution 2758 of the
U.N. General Assembly in 1971.</P>
      <P>Huang rebutted the U.N. chief's statement, saying that the resolution 2758
simply acknowledged the PROC as the sole legitimate government of China and gave
it China's seat in the United Nations.</P>
      <P>He said that Ban had made a great mistake by thinking that resolution having
accepted China's claim over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This misunderstanding, if left uncorrected in U.N. official correspondence, will
hinder Taiwan's efforts to join international organizations as a state with
sovereignty, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The United States which only acknowledges China's claim that Taiwan is part of
its territory didn't see eye to eye with Ban on this issue and was pushing the
U.N. chief to correct his statement, Huang said.</P>

      <P>Tropical Storm Sepat, forming in waters east of the Philippines early Monday, is
likely to move toward Taiwan over the coming week, forecasters at the Central
Weather Bureau (CWB) said.</P>
      <P>The forecasters said they are closely monitoring the movement of the tropical
storm, which was centered 1,530 km east-northeast of Manila at 2 a.m. and was
moving slowly west-southwesterly before turning westerly.</P>
      <P>Although the storm is still 1,600 km from Taiwan and is expected to maintain its
slow movement over the next couple of days, it is likely to continue to gain
momentum and approach the island, they said.</P>
      <P>Also Monday, the CWB again warned residents in central, southern and
southeastern parts of Taiwan to prepare for heavy rains triggered by a strong
southwest air current.</P>
      <P>In the mountainous areas of southern Taiwan, residents should be on guard
against possible landslides and mudflows brought about by excessively heavy
rains, while those living in downstream sections of rivers should watch out for
possible floods, the forecasters said.</P>
      <P>From midnight until 6: 50 a.m. Monday, accumulated rainfall registered 216 mm in
Wanluan, Pingtung County, 200 mm in Kaohsiung County's Taoyuan and Sanmin areas,
and 182 mm in Taitung County's Tajen township, according to CWB tallies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President reiterates need for new constitution</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 13 (CNA)
08/13/07  15:32:38
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reiterated Monday the necessity for Taiwan to tailor-
make a new constitution that is viable and up to date to enhance the country's
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Addressing the issue during a conference on the challenges faced by new
democracies held by the Taiwan Thinktank, Chen identified what he called the
stiff, outdated and illusory "greater China ideology" as the major enemy and
culprit that has been hampering, delaying and impairing the development of
Taiwan's constitutional democracy.</P>
      <P>In order to sustain such an ideology, the past authoritarian rulers of Taiwan
turned the position of president into that of a monarch, while the legislature,
which had originally been designed to be elected via regular elections, was made
into "a virtually eternal body," Chen noted.</P>
      <P>"Furthermore, a constitution that was never approved by the Taiwanese people was
imposed on us, and no revision or changes have so far been allowed to be made to
the original text of the constitution," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has now become a truly democratic and free country, the
country's democratic system is far from being complete, Chen said, adding that
there are five steps that the nation can take to improve the situation.</P>
      <P>First of all, the country should strengthen the Taiwan-centric consciousness to
protect Taiwan's status as a sovereign country and uphold its right to
participate in the international community, including becoming a full member of
the World Health Organization and the United Nations, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the president continued, the country should deepen its democracy by
amending the highly restrictive Referendum Law to facilitate the enactment of
the new constitution, he said.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, the country should create an environment favorable for fair competition
between political parties, he said, stressing that a normal democratic country
should not tolerate the existence of a party with "ill-gotten assets" worth tens
of billions of New Taiwan dollars and that the government should reclaim the
Kuomintang's "ill-gotten assets" to realize transitional justice.</P>
      <P>Fourthly,  Taiwan media should establish  a self-discipline mechanism to enhance
their credibility, he said.</P>
      <P>Fifthly, the president said, the country should raise public awareness on
participating in public affairs and public discussion.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, in addition to the "split national identity," the military
threat posed by China is another unique challenge facing Taiwan's democratic
development.</P>
      <P>Noting that China has always stigmatized Taiwan's efforts to pursue freedom and
democracy as moves toward "de jure independence, " Chen said he believes Taiwan
is the only country in the world that has to endure such heavy pressure in order
to protect its democracy.</P>
      <P>Despite the threat by Beijing, Chen asserted, Taiwan is a sovereign country, and
only its 23 million people have the right to determine the country's future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President to visit Nicaragua after Taiwan-Central America summit</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that he will visit Nicaragua for a meeting
with his counterpart Daniel Ortega following a visit to Honduras in late August,
where he will attend a presidential  summit meeting between  Taiwan and its
diplomatic allies in Central America and the Caribbean.</P>
      <P>Chen made the announcement during a meeting with visiting Nicaraguan  Vice
President  Jaime Rene Morales  Carazo at the Presidential Office. He described
the plan for him to make a state visit to Nicaragua as a perfect arrangement
after Morales was appointed to attend the summit on behalf of Ortega.</P>
      <P>At the meeting, Chen extended a warm welcome to Morales and offered his
congratulations on Ortega and Morales' electoral victory.</P>
      <P>Chen said he was honored to be invited to take part in the ceremony marking
their inauguration held Jan. 10 in Managua. At that time he met with Ortega at
the Sandinistas' headquarters and the new president promised to maintain
diplomatic ties between Taiwan and Nicaragua, for which Taiwan was very moved
and grateful.</P>
      <P>When the Ortega-led Sandinista National Liberation Front was in power for the
first time between 1985 and 1990, Nicaragua switched diplomatic  allegiance from
Taipei to Beijing.  The Nicaraguan government resumed diplomatic ties with
Taiwan after Violeta Chamorro took power in 1990.</P>
      <P>Since regaining the presidency early this year, Ortega has reaffirmed on many
occasions his determination to maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan, even
after Costa Rica switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in June.</P>
      <P>Morales arrived in Taiwan Sunday for the second assembly of the Democratic
Pacific Union, an international body founded by Vice President Annette Lu to
promote democracy, peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and the
world. The two-day event opened in Taipei Monday.</P>
      <P>This is Morales' second visit to Taiwan. His first was in July 2001.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to head for Honduras Aug. 20 to take part in the Taiwan-
Central America summit. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
invitations have been extended to the heads of state of Guatemala, Honduras,
Belize, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Panama and the Dominican Republic.</P>

      <P>Taiwan must strive to rectify its name, write a new constitution and join the
United Nations in order to survive as an independent sovereign state in
international society, ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu
Shyi-kun said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks in a news conference while answering questions about a U.S.
media report that Beijing is planning to counteract Taiwan's bid to join the
United Nations by seeking to propose a vote in the coming U. N. General Assembly
on its claim that "Taiwan forms part of the People's Republic of China."</P>
      <P>Although Yu called the report speculation that has yet to be confirmed, he urged
Beijing to reassess such action and said that "Taiwan will respond if China
takes the action."</P>
      <P>According to Yu, the Taiwan public are divided over three different approaches
regarding the country's future -- seeking Taiwan's eventual unification with
China, maintaining the status quo between the two sides and seeking to make
Taiwan a normal country through joining the United Nations, writing a new
constitution and rectifying its name.</P>
      <P>Yu claimed that eventual unification with China would be the equivalent of
immediate suicide to Taiwan and that maintaining the cross-Taiwan Strait status
quo would be gradual suicide.  He added that only turning Taiwan into a normal
country will provide the country with a lifeline amid China's aggressive
pressure to squeeze it on the world stage.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A water shortage crisis on the outlying Penghu island group has eased
considerably since more than 200 mm of rain has fallen in the area in the past
five days, government officials in charge of water affairs said Monday.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Water Resources Agency under the Ministry of Economic Affairs
said they had decided to put on hold a plan that would ask the state-run Taiwan
Water Corp. to ship fresh water from southern Taiwan from Aug. 16 to relieve the
Penghu shortage.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, although two recent tropical storms -- Pabuk and
Wutip -- that swept across Taiwan brought very little rainfall to Penghu, the
southwesterly air currents following the two storms gave local residents their
much-needed rain.</P>
      <P>Water levels in Penghu's three reservoirs have continued to rise steadily and
according to a forecast by the Central Weather Bureau, the wet weather will
continue for at least two more days, which should end Penghu's drought
completely.</P>
      <P>Penghu's demand for fresh water has increased in recent years as a result of
booming tourism. Its three major reservoirs can supply more than 5,000 metric
tons of water per day, while three sea water desalination plants and five well
water desalination plants have a total water output of 17,980 metric tons.</P>
      <P>The government is building two additional sea water desalination plants in
Makung and Hsiyu, which, when completed by the end of this year, will produce
5,500 tons and 750 tons of fresh water daily, respectively.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Eighty-four percent of office workers polled in Taiwan are enthusiastic about
starting their own businesses, mainly because of dissatisfaction with low pay,
according to the results of a survey released Monday by an online employment
service provider.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by 1111 Job Bank between July 27 and Aug. 10 among
1,174 workers. It had a margin of error of 2.9 percent.</P>
      <P>While 56.56 percent of the respondents expressed their desire to open their own
businesses, 27.77 percent were actually doing so, the survey shows.</P>
      <P>The results are consistent with that of another survey carried out in July among
a group of newcomers to the job market, in which 75.48 percent of the
respondents either had the desire or were making the move to start their own
businesses.</P>
      <P>Similar to the results of a survey conducted last year, the latest survey
indicates that low salaries offered by their present jobs remain the top reason
motivating office workers to open their own businesses, with 52.53 percent of
respondents mentioning this reason.</P>
      <P>A total of 45.25 percent of respondents said becoming their own boss is part of
their career plan, while 39.6 percent said they want to do jobs that fit their
interests or expertise.</P>
      <P>On the fields that potential business starters aim to enter, 37.98 percent
intend to open an ice dessert and beverage store, 21.82 percent want to open a
restaurant and 15.35 percent plan to open a convenience store.</P>
      <P>Opening an ice dessert and beverage store was also the top choice of potential
business starters surveyed last year. The result also corresponds to tallies
showing that franchises in this category account for nearly 50 percent of the
total number of franchises in the country.</P>
      <P>However, the online auction industry, which was the second-most popular choice
among potential business starters last year, has been squeezed out of the top 10
list this year, after Yahoo! Taiwan started collecting transaction fees from
sellers.</P>
      <P>The survey found that prospective business starters spend 7.71 months and
NT$800,000 on average preparing to open their businesses.</P>
      <P>On the sources of their startup capital, 79.09 percent rely on savings, 47.58
percent rely on bank financing and 33.23 percent rely on loans from friends or
relatives, according to the survey.</P>

      <P>Gary Wang, president of the Eastern Multimedia Group, was indicted along with 31
others Monday on charges of embezzling group funds, with the probe's lead
prosecutor seeking a 28-year imprisonment for Wang.</P>
      <P>The prosecutor accuses Gary Wang of colluding with his father Wang You-theng,
who founded the Rebar Asia Pacific Group, to loot NT$37.9 billion (US$1.14
billion) from the group.</P>
      <P>The senior Wang fled to the United States long before a prosecutor indicted him,
along with 106 others, for embezzling funds from the Rebar group in separate
case on March 8. The prosecutor in that case has requested a 30-year jail term.</P>
      <P>The prosecutor in charge of the Eastern Multimedia Group probe also accuses Gary
Wang of embezzling NT$3.3 billion from the Eastern group.</P>
      <P>His wife Tsai Hsueh-ching, who went into hiding in the United States after her
husband was investigated, was indicted as an accomplice, for whom the prosecutor
is seeking a jail term of 10 years.</P>
      <P>Five others members of Wang's family have also been indicted in the case,
including Gary's brother Wang Ling-yi, his sister-in-law Kuo Chi-ling, his uncle
Wang Shih-chang, his father Wang You-theng, and Wang You-theng's wife Wang Chin
Shyh-ying who is staying with her husband in a suburban mansion in Los Angeles.</P>
      <P>Notable among the accused are Chang Shu-sen, general manager of the Eastern TV,
for whom the prosecutor asking for an one-year jail term, and Tung Chia-ching,
financial chief of the Eastern group, for whom the prosecutor is seeking a
16-year jail term.</P>
      <P>The case came to light on Dec. 30, 2006 when Wang You-theng and Wang Chin Shyh-
ying flew to the United States one day after the Rebar group applied for
bankruptcy protection.</P>
      <P>That prompted a rush on the Chinese Bank, which was owned by the Wang's family.</P>
      <P>Although Gary Wang argued that his business group was financially independent of
the Rebar group of his father, investigators searched the Eastern group on June
14 anyway, and placed him in custody June 17.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A two-day international conference hosted by the Taiwan Thinktank opened Monday
to discuss a theme titled "After the Third Wave -- Problems And Challenges for
New Democracies, " with more than 40 scholars from Argentina, Canada, Ireland,
South Korea, Italy, Australia, the U.K., the U.S. and Taiwan participating.</P>
      <P>A study by Robert Elgie, a professor at Dublin City University, shows that the
semi-presidential system has had a poor record in advancing   democratization.
Elgie  also  concluded  that president-parliamentary forms, which Taiwan uses,
perform worse than premier-presidential forms in which the prime minister is
responsible only to the legislature.</P>
      <P>He also found that "cohabitation, " which means the president and the prime
minister come from different political parties, and a divided minority
government, do not result in failures of democratic transition.</P>
      <P>The eventual abandoning of the semi-presidential system and the single
nontransferable vote, which is regarded as the secret of one-party dominance,
and the switch to a single-member simple plurality system in Taiwan, Japan and
South Korea could be explained as a political reform and formation of a new
order, while the old regime is collapsing, said Lin Jih-wen, a research fellow
at Taiwan's Academia Sinica.</P>
      <P>In another session, Benjamin Reilly, a professor from Australian National
University, argued that recent political reform across Asia, including that of
Taiwan, has seen the emergence of a more genuine "Asian  model"  of democracy
that is moving  closer  to the Anglo-American system of "majoritarism, "
electoral competition and two-party politics.</P>
      <P>Guillermo O'Donnell, a professor of politics from the University of Notre Dame,
delivered a keynote speech at the conference on democratic theories after the
Third Wave.</P>

      <P>The secretary-general of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) speculated Monday
that the court will hand down a not guilty verdict on Ma Ying-jeou, the party's
presidential candidate who was indicted on corruption charges over alleged
misuse of special municipal allowance when he served as mayor of Taipei from
1998-2006.</P>
      <P>Wu Den-yih made the remarks to reporters a day before the Taipei District Court
is to hand down its ruling on the case. Ma was indicted in Feb. 13 after a group
of ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers filed a lawsuit alleging
him of embezzling some NT$11.17 million in public funds.</P>
      <P>Ma was accused of remitting the money to his wife's bank account -- half of the
total special municipal monthly allowance designated for his discretionary use
during his two mayoral terms.</P>
      <P>According to the law, half of the mayoral special allowance requires proof of
spending in the form of receipts before the money can be reimbursed, while the
other half of the funds can be used "freely" by the mayor for "public duties."</P>
      <P>Ma was charged with "knowingly embezzling" the funds that do not need receipts
or invoices, but he maintained his innocence on the grounds that half of the
special allowance was earmarked for his "free" use, as is also the case for more
than 6,500 ranking government officials and over 40,000 retired local government
and state agency chiefs.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, Ma did not have any intention of embezzling the money and thus
did not commit any crime. He expressed his hope that the court will deliver a
"fair judgment" and clear Ma's name.</P>
      <P>Speaking in a Legislative Yuan news conference the same day, DPP legislative
caucus whip Ker Chien-ming called on the judges to pass an impartial verdict on
Ma, as their ruling will have a far-reaching impact on Taiwan's politics.</P>
      <P>As Ma was accused of using public funds to pay for his family's daily expenses,
Ker urged the public to vigorously examine his integrity -- a key element that
he claimed is critical to an aspirant vying for the presidency.</P>

      <P>The Taipei mayor and the Taipei County magistrate walked out of a meeting Monday
in protest over the central government's plans for allocation of tax revenues
among Taipei, Kaohsiung and Taipei County.</P>
      <P>The allocation of funds became an issue of contention after Taipei County joined
the rank of Taipei and Kaohsiung as an administrative area under the direct
jurisdiction of the Cabinet in early May.</P>
      <P>During the Monday meeting, a special committee of the Cabinet continued to
discuss fund allocation, using NT$150 billion (US$4.54 billion) as the basis,
although finance officials had acknowledged earlier that the centrally allotted
tax revenues for 2008 would amount to NT$250 billion.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin deplored the committee's refusal to use the 2008
figures as the basis for discussions on the grounds that the Law Governing the
Allocation of Government Revenues and Expenditures first needs to be amended.</P>
      <P>Hau said the Cabinet should have asked the legislature to amend the law during
its extraordinary session July 10-20 to pave the way for the planned allocation
of tax revenue next year.</P>
      <P>He strongly disagreed with the Cabinet's plan to cut NT$20 billion from Taipei's
budget and NT$10.5 billion from Kaohsiung's budget and give the money to Taipei
County.</P>
      <P>Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei pointed out that the county will see
increased activity and operations after being placed under the direct control of
the Cabinet, and that the county needs at least an extra NT$62.9 billion in 2008
to balance its budget.</P>
      <P>Chou complained that the Cabinet would only allocate an extra NT$30.5 billion,
leaving the county to face a shortfall of NT$30 billion.</P>
      <P>He threatened to resolve the issue through legal action or even encourage Taipei
County residents to take to the streets to fight for a fair share of the budget.</P>
      <P>According to the Distribution Regulations for Centrally-Allotted Tax Revenues,
the special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung currently are entitled to 43
percent of the centrally allotted tax revenues.</P>

      <P>A pioneering project to establish the planned Taiwan Biobank will be activated
in November, with its executor, Academia Sinica, beginning to collect blood
samples from local people in hope that the blood will provide clues to the top
10 causes of death as well as to the causes of top 20 diseases in Taiwan, a
spokesman for the academic institution said Monday.</P>
      <P>Dr. Chen Yuan-tsong, director of the Academia Sinica Institute of Biomedical
Sciences (IBS), said that during the initial stage of the project, researchers
will try to collect at least 15,000 blood samples with financial support of the
Department of Health.</P>
      <P>The operation will also be overseen by ethical experts and scholars in order to
prevent disputes over privacy and human rights violations -- a measure included
after some human rights groups accused the Institute in 2006 of such violations
after it gathered blood samples from indigenous people of the country before
ethic disputes surrounding the move were settled, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the approximate cost for the establishment of the
15,000-people biobank has been assessed at NT$400 million. Their long-term goal
is to expand the biobank to include blood samples from 200,000 people, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>So far, the IBS has not yet decided on how the databank will be managed, Chen
pointed out, noting it can be a non-profit corporation, or the IBS to be
commissioned to run the Taiwan Biobank, and that they have two years' time to
discuss the issue.</P>
      <P>Beginning in November, the project's personnel will begin to collect blood
samples of volunteers in the Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Miaoli, Yunlin, Chiayi, Tainan,
Hualien and Taitung areas. No ethnic groups are specifically targeted for blood
collection, according to the IBS, which also revealed that the blood samples of
those who have concerns about their blood donations to the Biobank will be
destroyed to respect their wishes.</P>

to the 2007 informal leadership meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum can be settled prior to President Chen Shui-bian's upcoming Latin
American visit.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials said that Australia, the host country of this year's informal
summit slated to be held in Sydney Sept. 8-9, will soon send an official to
Taiwan to present the invitation.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that Taiwan can reach an agreement with Australia on the identity of
the APEC envoy prior to Chen's departure for the diplomatic tours Aug. 21, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>They said President Chen is currently considering four or five possible
candidates, adding that all of them "currently hold no official posts, " and
that all will "underscore Taiwan-centric consciousness as well as upgrade
Taiwan's image."</P>
      <P>They said that the prospective candidates have a financial or economic
background, or they have served as APEC envoys before, although Morris Chang,
chairman of the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. will not be included in
the short list.</P>
      <P>Chang served as President Chen's envoy to attend the summit hosted by Vietnam in
its capital, Hanoi last year.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is a member of the APEC, due to Beijing's opposition, none of
its presidents has ever attended the summit since its inception in 1993.
Instead, the country has sent envoys in place of its president to the summits.</P>

      <P>Eight Chinese swimmers arrived at Taipei Monday for the "swim across the Taiwan
Strait" activity to be held later this week.</P>
      <P>Long distance Taiwan swimmer Wang Han, who initiated the activity, greeted the
Chinese swimmers at the Taoyuan International Airport.</P>
      <P>Wang said that 28 swimmers -- including 16 from Taiwan, eight from China and
four from South Africa -- will be divided into 14 teams with two members in each
team for the journey.</P>
      <P>Each team will swim for 60 minutes before another team takes over for the round
the clock journey, he added.</P>
      <P>The swimmers plan to dive into water at the Fishermen's Wharf in Tamsui, Taipei
County, at 3 p.m. Thursday and hope to arrive at Fuao Wharf on the Taiwan-held
outlying island of Matsu in four or five days if weather and sea conditions
permit.</P>

cross-Taiwan Strait journey from either Taoyuan County or Hsinchu County to
reach Pingtan, Fujian province in southeastern China.</P>

      <P>The straight-line distance across the Taiwan Strait is 170 kilometers, but the
actual swimming distance, when taking into account detours to avoid sharks and

      <P>A supra-ministerial emergency response center came into operation Monday
afternoon after parts of the country were hit by extremely heavy rains.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) made the announcement after torrential
rains,  brought by southwesterly air currents resulting from Tropical Storm
Wutip, claimed one life in central Taiwan, disrupted trains in southern Taiwan,
and left over 1,000 passengers stranded on Green Island off the southeastern
Taiwan coast.</P>
      <P>The center is staffed with officials from the National Fire Agency,  the Council
of Agriculture, the National Science and Technology Center for Disaster
Reduction, the Central Weather Bureau, the Construction and Planning Agency
under the Ministry of the Interior, the MOEA's Water Resources Agency, and the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications.</P>
      <P>Officials said they will closely monitor the situation from the center.</P>
      <P>Water Resources Agency officials said that the center of heavy rains began to
move northward from Pingtung and Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan to Taichung in
central Taiwan early Monday morning.</P>
      <P>Officials also noted that in those places the volume of daily precipitation has

    <HEADLINE>DPP candidate advocates 'two countries, one system' in Indonesia</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Jakarta,  Indonesia,  Aug.  13 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Relations across the Taiwan Strait should develop in a "two countries, one
system" direction, the presidential candidate of Taiwan's ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , said in Jakarta Monday at the start of his visit in
Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Frank Hsieh broached the idea in an interview with Suara Karya, an Indonesian
newspaper, shortly after his arrival in the Indonesian capital from Singapore
where he just concluded a three-day visit.</P>
      <P>Questioning the wisdom of Beijing's "one country, two systems" overture for
cross-strait unification, Hsieh said the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should
be characterized as two countries and both of them should uphold the same
political system, namely "one democracy system."</P>
      <P>In his view, Hsieh said only the "two countries, one system" formula will
contribute to both sides' popular well-being and regional stability.</P>
      <P>Noting that China's military budget has grown past what it needs to counter
Taiwan, Hsieh said such a development should be a common concern to Asia-Pacific
regional security.</P>
      <P>While everybody hopes to see China rise peacefully, Hsieh said its attitude
toward Taiwan could be a litmus test. If China cannot tolerate Taiwan or cannot
resolve the cross-strait issue with peaceful means, he said, it would not be
just a problem to Taiwan but would concern regional security and even the
stability of entire world.</P>
      <P>Touching on the purpose of his current visit, Hsieh said he looks forward to
expanding his global vision through the visit as he is running for Taiwan's next
presidency.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties between Taiwan and Indonesia,
Hsieh said the two countries have maintained close interaction in various
fields. It is hoped that his visit will contribute to mutual understanding and
friendship between the two countries, he added.</P>
      <P>On the prospect of his presidential bid, Hsieh said he is confident that he will
emerge as the final winner in next year's presidential election in which Ma
Ying-jeou, the main opposition Kuomintang's standard bearer, will be his main
rival.</P>
      <P>Hsieh received VIP treatment upon his arrival at the Jakarta international
airport. Many Taiwanese expatriates greeted him at the hotel where he is staying
during his visit.</P>
      <P>Hsieh met with Indonesia Vice President Jusuf Kalla Monday evening. On Tuesday,
he will attend seminars with Indonesian business executives and legal scholars
and experts as well as take part in a charitable activity to be hosted by the
wife of the Indonesian vice president.</P>
      <P>Hsieh will also meet with the Indonesian industry minister Tuesday and receive
an interview with an Indonesian television station. In the evening, he will
attend a dinner to be given by the Taiwanese expatriates association in his
honor and afterwards, he will hold talks with Indonesian officials and
lawmakers. He is scheduled to wrap up his Indonesia visit and return to Taiwan
Wednesday when he will formally announce who his running mate will be.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese people traveling to Bali, Indonesia should be on guard after
Indonesian government confirmed the first human death due to avian influenza on
the resort island, an official of the Department of Health (DOH) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chou Chih-hao, deputy director of DOH's Centers for Disease Control, urged
Taiwan tourists not to have contact with fowl, not to eat raw fowl products, and
to wash hands and change clothes immediately in case they happen to touch bird
droppings.</P>
      <P>If they don't feel well within 10 days of their return, they should seek medical
treatment immediately, Chou said.</P>
      <P>But he noted that the death in this case took place in a remote region about 100
km outside Denpasar, the capital of Bali, and the DOH will not advise Taiwan
tourist against going there, although they are advised to be on guard about
their own health.</P>
      <P>Avian influenza virus usually refers to Influenza A viruses found chiefly in
birds, but infections can occur in humans. The risk is generally low for most
people, because the viruses do not usually infect humans. However, confirmed
cases of human infection have been reported since 1997.</P>

      <P>The central government worked out new measures Monday for allocating centrally
dispensed tax revenues to Taipei, Kaohsiung and Taipei County, although the
Taipei mayor and the Taipei County magistrate walked out of a meeting earlier in
protest.</P>
      <P>A special committee of the Cabinet called the meeting because the allocation of
funds required review after Taipei County joined the rank of Taipei and
Kaohsiung as an administrative area under the direct jurisdiction of the Cabinet
in early May.</P>
      <P>The committee insisted on letting the three administrative areas share 43
percent of the centrally allotted tax, using the 2007 total of NT$150 billion
(US$4.54 billion) as the basis. The new measures will increase Taipei County's
share from NT$9.8 billion to NT$30.5 billion.</P>
      <P>However, Taipei City will see its share of tax revenue decrease from NT$58.2
billion to NT$38.2 billion, while Kaohsiung City's NT$21.9 billion is being
slashed to NT$11.4 billion.</P>
      <P>The committee decided to compensate most of the two special municipalities for
loses with subsidies, with Taipei receiving NT$15.5 billion and Kaohsiung
getting NT$10 billion. This means Taipei still faces a shortfall of NT$4.5
billion, while Kaohsiung will suffer a loss of NT$500 million.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin and Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei withdrew
from the meeting in protest, saying that the Cabinet should not have used NT$150
billion as the basis for drawing up the budget.</P>
      <P>They contended that finance officials had acknowledged earlier that the
centrally allotted tax revenues for 2008 would amount to NT$250 billion, and
that this figure should have been the basis for discussions.</P>
      <P>Hau strongly disagreed with the Cabinet's plan to cut NT$20 billion from
Taipei's budget and NT$10.5 billion from Kaohsiung's budget and give the money
to Taipei County, although the losses of Taipei and Kaohsiung will be partially
compensated through subsidies.</P>
      <P>Chou pointed out that the county will need NT$62.9 billion in 2008 to balance
its budget. He contended that by allocating NT$30.5 billion to Taipei County,
the Cabinet will leaving the county to face a shortfall of NT$30 billion.</P>
      <P>He threatened to seek to resolve the issue through legal action or even
encourage Taipei County residents to take to the streets to fight for a fair
share of the budget.</P>
      <P>According to the Distribution Regulations for Centrally-Allotted Tax Revenues,
the special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung are currently entitled to 43
percent of the centrally allotted tax revenues.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that holding a referendum on Taiwan's bid
to join the United Nations under the name of Taiwan is the common aspiration of
a majority of the people of Taiwan, rather than his personal preference.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with Eni Falemavaega, chairman of the
Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific and the Global Environment under the U.S.
House Committee on Foreign Affairs, who is currently on a visit in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Referring to U.S. opposition to the Chen administration's plan to hold a
referendum on Taiwan's U.N. bid under the name Taiwan, Chen said it seems to him
that the United States has downgraded the issue to his "personal business."</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan and the United States have shared views and interests in many
fields, particularly in maintaining peace and security in the Asia-Pacific. He
further said he treasures the longstanding Taiwan-U.S. friendship and
appreciates the contribution the U.S. government and people have made to
Taiwan's democratization and treasures.</P>
      <P>Noting that he doesn't like to see mistrust between the two sides simply because
of misunderstanding or insufficient communications over the U.N. membership
issue, Chen said he hopes the two sides can strengthen dialogue on relevant
topics.</P>
      <P>Stressing that an overwhelming majority of Taiwan people have a strong desire to
see their country obtain representation in the United Nations under the name of
Taiwan, Chen said it is necessary for his administration to push for a national
referendum to let the world hear the Taiwan people's voice and pay heed to their
common aspiration.</P>
      <P>Holding such a referendum has nothing to do with a change to the country's
official title, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Chen  said he earnestly  hopes  that the U.S. administration can
attach importance to a resolution passed by the House of Representative
recently  calling  for a removal  of restrictions on senior Taiwan officials'
visit to the United States because the resolution reflects a common voice of the
Congress.</P>

      <P>The U.N. chief's "expanded interpretation" of U.N. Resolution 2758 is not in the
interest of the United States and Washington would take actions as a result,
Foreign Affairs Minister James Huang said Monday.</P>
      <P>U.N.Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon's statement has caused "serious concerns" in
Washington, Hwang said Monday in an interview with the CNA. He did not give any
details.</P>
      <P>The minister admitted that, in the short term, it would be difficult for
Washington to adjust to the change in Taiwan's strategy in trying to rejoin the
United Nations.</P>
      <P>"After bilateral discussion, however, the United States should be able to
understand that its interests would only be served by supporting (there being a
separate) Taiwan identity," he noted.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Huang also warned against any attempt by Beijing to push for a
vote in the United Nations on China's claim on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Would such a move be a step on the red-line of the Taiwan people? ...In
everything they do, Beijing would need to take into account the feeling of the
Taiwan people," he said.</P>
      <P>Huang's remarks came after unconfirmed reports that Beijing might consider
giving more bite to the U.N. secretary-general's comments about Taiwan being
part of China.</P>
      <P>Answering questions in July, Ban said that the United Nations' position has been
that Taiwan is part of China after the U.N. General Assembly adopted the
resolution in October, 1971.</P>
      <P>The comments caused some angry reaction in Taipei, with the Taiwan government
saying the resolution did nothing more than giving China seat to Beijing at the
expense of Taipei.</P>

Tuesday to facilitate  its assessment of a plan to purchase eight U.S.-built

      <P>The delegation, composed of legislators from across the party spectrum, will
visit Washington, D.C. and Boston and make a transit stop in Los Angeles while
canceling its original plan to tour U.S. military base in Hawaii, the sources
said.</P>
      <P>Because of media criticism and partisan disputes over the trip, the sources
said, Vice Defense Minister Ko Cheng-heng has canceled his plan to join the
group and the duration and itinerary of the trip have both shortened.</P>
      <P>According to an Aug. 7 meeting between legislative and military staff, the
sources said the delegation will be composed of nine lawmakers, including Liao
Wan-ju and Shui Hua-ming from the main opposition Kuomintang, Shen Fa-hui and

Legislative Yuan, the sources said, adding that none of the expenditures will
come from the NT$200 million budget set aside for assessing feasibility of the

see their country obtain representation in the United Nations under the name of
Taiwan, Chen said it is necessary for his administration to push for a national
referendum to let the world hear the Taiwan people's voice and pay heed to their
common aspiration.</P>
      <P>Holding such a referendum has nothing to do with a change to the country's
official title, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Chen  said he earnestly  hopes  that the U.S. administration can
attach importance to a resolution passed by the House of Representative
recently  calling  for a removal  of restrictions on senior Taiwan officials'
visit to the United States because the resolution reflects a common voice of the
Congress.</P>

      <P>Leaders of a Taiwanese expatriate group in the United States are expected to
meet with fugitive Rebar Asia Pacific Group founder Wang You-theng and his wife
later this week to persuade the couple to return to Taiwan to face criminal
charges, an official said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to Lee Ping-hsin, chief of the Los Angeles chapter of the Taiwanese
Benevolent Association of America (TBAA) , the couple have drawn much attention
in the Taiwanese expatriate community since they fled to the United States more
than six months ago, and the association will try to arrange a meeting with the
couple in the next few days to talk face-to-face with them.</P>
      <P>TBAA President Lo Su-o, who is scheduled to arrive in Los Angeles Wednesday to
prepare for the association's 30th annual meeting, will visit the Wangs at their
residence located in South Pasadena and invite them out for dinner, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee further said that in addition to Lo and himself, chiefs of the TBAA's Las
Vegas and Orange County chapters will also join the persuasion effort.</P>
      <P>Wang, who had been held at an immigration holding center in San Pedro, Calif.
since Feb. 2, was released on bail Aug. 7.</P>
      <P>Wang was detained when he tried to return to Los Angeles with both his Republic
of China and Dominican Republic passports canceled, following a failed attempt
to flee to Myanmar via Singapore.</P>
      <P>Wang is suspected of having embezzled billions of dollars in corporate funds
from the group before fleeing with his wife, Wang Chin She-ying, to China late
last year and then to the United States in January this year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan authorities placed the couple on the country's most-wanted list Jan. 15
and have been seeking U.S. assistance to have them repatriated back to Taiwan to
face charges.</P>
      <P>In March, Taiwanese prosecutors indicted Wang and 106 others involved in the
Rebar Group scandal on a long list of charges, including fraud, money laundering
and insider trading. They are seeking a prison sentence of 30 years and an
unprecedented fine of NT$1.71 billion (US$52.13 million) for Wang.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian refrained from making any comments Tuesday on the
acquittal of former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou on corruption charges, saying the
case is still pending.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after the Taipei District Court cleared Ma, who is now the
main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) presidential candidate, of all corruption
charges earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Ma was indicted Feb. 13 on suspicion of diverting NT$11.17 million in government
funds into his personal account during his tenure as Taipei mayor from
1998-2006. The "not guilty" verdict removed a dark shadow over Ma's presidential
bid, even though the prosecution may still appeal the case.</P>
      <P>Chen was asked about his view on Ma's acquittal while visiting a stationery ware
manufacturing company in Taipei County's Panchiao City as part of his community
outreach tour.</P>
      <P>Noting that the case has not yet been closed, Chen said it's inappropriate for
him to make any comment at the moment.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Ma's acquittal will have any impact on the outcome of the 2008
presidential election, Chen didn't give a direct response, saying instead that
the most important thing for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party is to
streamline its ranks.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung urged leaders of local governments to refrain from
self-serving actions and called for their consideration of the central
government's difficulties given falling tax income and rising spending.</P>
      <P>Chang made the call in response to media inquiries relating to the dispute over
the distribution of centrally allocated tax revenues after the mayors of Taipei
and Kaohsiung, and the Taipei County magistrate voiced protests Monday against
the Executive Yuan's decision to let the three administrative areas share 43
percent of the centrally allotted tax revenues.</P>
      <P>The decision has resulted in significant drops in the share of revenue allocated
for Taipei and Kaohsiung. At the same time, while Taipei County Magistrate Chou
Hsi-wei acknowledges that funding for his county will rise significantly as a
result of joining Taipei and Kaohsiung under the direct jurisdiction of the
Cabinet, the money the county  receives  from the central  government  will
still be insufficient to help Taiwan's largest county balance its budget in
2008.</P>
      <P>Chou argued that the Cabinet should not have used the tax revenue of 2007 --
totalling NT$150 billion (US$4.54 billion) -- as the basis for drawing up the
2008 budget given that finance officials have acknowledged that the centrally
allotted tax revenues for next year would amount to NT$250 billion.</P>
      <P>Chang attributed the disputes to the Legislative Yuan's amendment in May to the
Act on Local Government Systems, allowing Taipei County to become a "quasi-
special municipality." However, he said the legislature failed to revise the law
governing the allocation of government revenues and expenditures at the same
time to re-arrange the tax revenue distribution.</P>
      <P>Under the existing law, the special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung are
entitled to 43 percent of the centrally allotted tax revenues. That ratio was
not changed despite the inclusion of Taipei County following the passage of the
law revision that makes the county eligible for special municipality status.</P>
      <P>Chang also stated that following Taipei County's upgrade to municipality status,
other counties and cities, including Taichung and Tainan, have also displayed a
strong desire to upgrade their status and obtain a larger share of centrally-
allotted tax revenues.</P>
      <P>Noting that the country's governmental system must be upheld, Chang said none of
individual people or administrative districts should try to "take more than
their fair share."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Court determines former mayor did not intend to embezzle funds</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei District Court determined Tuesday that former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-
jeou had no intention to embezzle from a special mayoral fund as it acquitted
him on corruption charges.</P>
      <P>The court rejected the prosecution's charge that Ma obtained the money through
"fraudulent means" and ruled in favor of Ma's claim that he used the fund in the
same manner as his predecessors.</P>
      <P>Ma was indicted Feb. 13 on charges of embezzling NT$11.17 million from a special
allowance fund designated for his discretionary use while he served as Taipei
mayor from 1998 to 2006. The funds in question were set aside to cover the
mayor's job-related expenses.</P>
      <P>The prosecutor in charge of the case claimed that Ma transferred half of those
public funds to his personal bank account every month, keeping that portion
which was not used as his personal income, with the knowledge that they were
public funds.</P>
      <P>The prosecutor claimed that although the government's regulations allow the
mayor to use half of the fund by simply signing a receipt instead of providing
vouchers to account for his spending, the money should go towards job-related
spending and that any remaining funds should be returned to the government's
coffers.</P>
      <P>However, the verdict issued by the Taipei District Court said that half of the
special allowance funds paid to executives holding public office without proof
of spending are meant as salary subsidies and that as soon as the payment is
made, the receivers are authorized to spend the money at their discretion.</P>
      <P>The practice is established by the Cabinet and should not be considered
"fraudulent," according to the verdict.</P>
      <P>On the prosecutor's claim that Ma confessed during a Sept. 12, 2006 questioning
that he was "aware that the special funds were public funds, " the verdict said
the claim was invalid because it was made based on a misinterpretation of Ma's
testimony.</P>
      <P>In addition, the court rejected written testimony prepared by the prosecutor
based on questioning Jan. 25, 2007 of a cashier at the Taipei City Government's
Secretariat, Wu Li-ju, after determining that the written testimony was
inaccurately recorded.</P>
      <P>Wu complained during a July 10 hearing that the written testimony did not record
her statement accurately, and the court later approved a request by Ma's lawyers
that the judge review the optical disc on which the entire process of the
questioning was recorded to check if there are any discrepancies between her
verbal statement and the written testimony.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, one of Ma's aides, Yu Wen, was convicted of using others' invoices to
help Ma to claim reimbursement from the special allowance fund, and sentenced to
two years and four months for forgery. That sentence was commuted to one year
and two months according to a commutation statute implemented on July 16.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite Ma Ying-jeou's acquittal of corruption charges by the Taipei District
Court, Vice President Annette Lu said Tuesday that Ma, the main opposition
Kuomintang's (KMT) presidential candidate, will have really proved his innocence
only if the Supreme Court issues the same ruling.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks while answering reporters' questions after the Taipei
District Court handed down a not guilty verdict in Ma's case earlier the same
day.</P>
      <P>Ma was indicted by Taipei prosecutors on embezzlement charges Feb. 13 after some
lawmakers of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) sued him over an
alleged mishandling of special municipal allowance earmarked for his
discretionary use when he served as mayor of Taipei during the 1998-2006 period.</P>
      <P>Lu said that she is unaware of the judges' reasons for issuing the not guilty
verdict, but she urged the public to respect the ruling.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Ma's acquittal would slash the DPP's chances in the March 22, 2008
presidential election, Lu said that the question should be directed to Frank
Hsieh, the ruling party's presidential candidate, who will return to Taiwan
Wednesday from a visit to Indonesia and Singapore.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who is currently visiting Jakarta, declined to comment on Ma's acquittal,
saying that "he won't talk about Taiwan's domestic affairs while on an overseas
visit."</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung also said that he had no comment on the latest
development involving Ma's embezzlement charges as prosecutors still can appeal
the case.</P>
      <P>"We fully respect the court's ruling and we won't make any comments regarding a
judicial case that has not yet finalized,"  he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei Prosecutors Office spokesman Lin Chin-tsun said that
prosecutors would assess whether to appeal the case after reading through the
judgment.</P>
      <P>According to the judgment, Ma was acquitted because he did not act dishonestly
nor induce anyone to commit a crime when seeking reimbursement of funds from the
special mayoral allowance.</P>
      <P>The supreme administrative court has made it clear that such special allowances
for ranking government  officials and local government chiefs may be viewed as
"substantial subsides," the court verdict said, adding that "Ma drew on the
special mayoral funds in a way consistent with the practices of his
predecessors."</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming, the DPP's legislative caucus whip, said in a Legislative Yuan
news conference that the result is "no surprise" at all and voiced the caucus'
full support for prosecutors to appeal the case.</P>
      <P>"Although Ma can escape legal punishment for the time being," Ker said, "Ma has
actually been given a political death penalty as his credibility is totally
bankrupt."</P>
      <P>Ker accused Ma of repeatedly lying to prosecutors during the probe and urged the
public to scrutinize his words and deeds.</P>

      <P>Christian media GOOD TV broadcast a discussion program Tuesday calling for
support for South Korean Christian aid workers who are being held hostage by
Afghanistan's Taliban insurgent group.</P>
      <P>Afghanistan's Taliban captured 23 South Korean Christian aid workers July 19,
offering to return them in exchange for Taliban prisoners held in Afghan jails.
Two of the hostages have been shot dead, two females freed, while another 19
remain captive.</P>
      <P>Those volunteer aid workers' misadventure has aroused both positive and negative
opinions. The televised discussion aimed to provide a Christian point of view on
this event in defense of the group and invited Christians to pray for them.</P>
      <P>Chang Kuei-yue, a senior reporter who served in the Balkans for seven years and
visited South Korea two weeks ago, said it is no easy task for missionaries to
go to war-torn and poverty-struck areas such as Afghanistan to preach religion.
Only people who understand the real value of life would place themselves in such
dangerous places, she added.</P>
      <P>Hsin-tien Covenant Church Rev. Chang Mao-song said it is admirable for Christian
missionaries to go to foreign countries to preach religion while providing
medical or educational services. He also said that those South Korean Christian
workers deserved the public's encouragement given their dedication.</P>
      <P>Chung Yuan Christian University professor Lin Chih-ping, who also participated
in the discussion, said sending missionaries abroad for missionary work is a
time-honored activity and has yield positive results around the world. South
Korea has nearly 16,000 missionaries preaching religion abroad, which is only
second to America's number. Taiwan also has a number of missionaries to do much
the same thing, Lin went on.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Fuel prices to be cut by NT$0.7 Wednesday</HEADLINE>

      <P>Domestic gasoline prices will be lowered by NT$0.7 per liter beginning
Wednesday and held constant until September, the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The MOEA froze a floating fuel pricing mechanism July 31 to begin an overall
review into the system in light of a rising public outcry against the floating
fuel price, with consumers complaining of surging gasoline prices.</P>
      <P>The MOEA activated the floating fuel pricing mechanism Sept. 14, 2006 to reflect
reasonable crude oil costs. Under the system, gasoline prices are adjusted
weekly based on the price of the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude traded on
the New York Mercantile Exchange.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Steve R. L. Chen announced Tuesday that in the near
future pricing adjustments will be conducted once a month, rather than each
week, in an attempt to address public complaints.</P>
      <P>The revised pricing mechanism will be implemented from Sept. 1. Until it is
implemented, fuel prices will not undergo further adjustments following
Wednesday's cut, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>On the price cut, Yu Kai-hsiung, secretary general of the non-profit Consumers'
Foundation, said the foundation insists that the domestic gasoline prices be
slashed by NT$2.5 per liter, arguing the state-run petroleum company, CPC Corp.,
Taiwan, adopted higher retail fuel prices last September when it began to carry
out the floating pricing mechanism.</P>
      <P>On last Sept. 14, the WTI price, taken as the benchmark in setting the price,
were at the same level as those in February. However, Yu said, the CPC's retail
price for a liter of 95 octane unleaded gasoline was recorded at a level NT$2.5
higher than the February price.</P>
      <P>In this regard, in fairness, gasoline prices should be lowered by a further
NT$2.5 following the upcoming NT$0.7-cut, Yu noted.</P>

      <P>Researchers at I-Shou University have developed the world's fastest 3C decoding
program, with a maximum calculating capacity 100 times faster than that of the
existing ones, the Kaohsiung County-based university announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The program is a collaborative creation between Professor Chang Yao-tsu and two
candidates for doctoral degrees at the university's Institute of Information
Engineering,  according to university officials.</P>
      <P>The team has already integrated the programs into computer chips that  can  be
utilized  in  products  in areas  of satellite communications, mobile
communications, digital audio-visual playing, and digital storage.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that thanks to an innovative error correcting theory developed by
the team, the calculating speed of the programs has been greatly enhanced in the
research and development process.</P>
      <P>Chang explained that almost all technologies and products related to digital
content require error correcting mechanisms to ensure the accuracy of data
transmission and storage, and that a decoder with a faster calculating potency
such as theirs not only improves service quality but also reduces the size of
the products.</P>
      <P>According to the university, the next step will involve seeking opportunities to
transfer the results to local manufacturers.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin announced Tuesday the city government's decision to
terminate its nine-year contract with the Eastern Multimedia Group to manage the
Taipei Arena, the city's first multifunctional indoor stadium.</P>
      <P>Hau made the announcement after public prosecutors indicted Eastern Multimedia
Chairman Gary Wang a day earlier on charges of committing a series of financial
crimes, including using collusive bidding to obtain the right to manage the
facility.</P>
      <P>Hau said the city government will set up a task force to take over the arena's
management, with Deputy Mayor Samuel Wu as its convener.</P>
      <P>Noting that at least seven shows will be staged in the arena from now until the
end of this year, Hau said the city government will do everything it can to make
sure the performances proceed unaffected.</P>
      <P>He also said he was satisfied that no Taipei city government officials were
involved in the bidding collusion.</P>
      <P>Asked how the city government will get the latest installment of concession fees
totaling some NT$129 million from the Eastern Multimedia Group, Hau said the
city government has a NT$150 million security deposit from Eastern Multimedia
and that the contract allows the city government to withhold money owed by the
group from that amount.</P>
      <P>Eastern Multimedia won the right to manage the Taipei Arena for nine years with
a bid of NT$1.58 billion in 2005 when Ma Ying-jeou was Taipei mayor.</P>
      <P>Taipei prosecutors have unearthed evidence that Wang and Hsieh Yin-lung, deputy
manager of an Eastern Multimedia subsidiary company formed specifically to
manage the arena, engaged in bidding collusion to allow Wang to obtain the
concession right.</P>
      <P>According to the prosecutors, Wang and Hsieh each formed a new company
specifically for the bidding, but Wang later paid Hsieh NT$24.78 million in
return for his promise that his bid would not go higher than Wang's -- an act in
violation of the Government Procurement Law.</P>
      <P>Wang and 31 of his associates were indicted Monday for their alleged involvement
in several embezzlement scandals. Prosecutors requested a 28-year sentence for
Wang, plus a fine of NT$1 billion.</P>

      <P>Seven lawmakers from across the party spectrum set off on an 11-day visit to the
United States Tuesday as part of a feasibility study for a submarine procurement
deal aimed at beefing up the country's defense capabilities.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers kept a low profile as they departed, declining to reveal any
details about their itinerary or even the number of people in the delegation.</P>
      <P>The members of the group are Shui Hua-ming, Su Chi and Liao Wan-ju of the main
opposition Kuomintang,  Fu Kun-chi of the opposition People First Party, Ho
Ming-hao of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union and Chang Hua-kuan and Shen
Fa-hui of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party. Two lawmakers -- Ko Chun-
hsiung and Lin Kuo-ching -- who were originally on the delegate list -- did not
show up.</P>
      <P>Because of media criticism and partisan disputes over the trip, Vice Defense
Minister Ko Cheng-heng canceled a plan to join the group and the duration and
itinerary of the journey have both been curtailed.</P>
      <P>The number of Ministry of National Defense (MND) staff members accompanying the
lawmakers on the visit has also been reduced, Legislative Yuan Defense Committee
sources said.</P>
      <P>In response to media criticism that the trip is a waste of taxpayers' money, the
sources said the legislators will have to foot part of their travel expenses out
of their own pockets. The remaining fees will be paid by the MND and the
Legislative Yuan, the sources said, adding that none of the expenditures will
come from the NT$200 million budget set aside for assessing feasibility of the
submarine deal as well as the type that most fits Taiwan's needs.</P>
      <P>Besides visiting the Pentagon, the sources said, the delegation will also visit
U.S. Navy headquarters and some shipyards on the U.S. East Coast. While the
group will make a transit stop in Los Angeles, it has canceled a plan to tour
U.S. naval bases on the West Coast and in Hawaii, the sources added.</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu called for greater attention to the rise of Chinese
nationalism, which she said is likely to reach its peak during the 2008 Olympic
Games to be held in Beijing Aug. 8-24.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks while addressing the second assembly of the Democratic
Pacific Union (DPU) , which took place Aug. 13-14 in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Lu said the Communist Party of China has been promoting Chinese nationalism.
Noting that China's rise could be a factor affecting the security and
development of the Pacific region, Lu said China saw an economic growth rate of
11.5 percent during the first half of this year and expects to overtake Germany
to become the world's third-largest economy.</P>
      <P>China is increasing its influence in the Pacific region in the aspects of
diplomacy, politics and the military, Lu said, adding that China is now eyeing
Central and South America amid its growing significance in Central Asia and
Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Lu said that against this backdrop, the United States is developing a wide range
of cooperation with Japan, Australia and India as part of its efforts to
consolidate its influence in Asia, particularly on the Korean peninsula and in
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>As a result, the U.S. acts as a counterforce against any rise of undemocratic
power in Asia, according to Lu.</P>
      <P>Past security mechanisms were confined to military power, Lu went on, adding
that there is a need for a security mechanism that should be open to all
countries.</P>
      <P>Lu claimed that only an open organization is able to change the international
situation, deter rogue regimes and combat terrorism. She said the DPU can
shoulder such responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Lu also predicted that China will replace the U.S. as the greatest producer of
greenhouse gas emissions in the next year, and she urged the world not to fight
over limited petroleum resources.</P>
      <P>Rather, she continued, the world should develop renewable energy in the Pacific
region and integrate the research results of many countries to turn the crisis
of global warming into an opportunity for sustainable development.</P>
      <P>Lu also announced that the DPU will form five associations within the next two
years in an effort to make greater contributions to the world and promote
democracy,  peace,  prosperity,  sustainable development and digitalization.</P>
      <P>During her address at a party welcoming nearly 100 foreign guests from 33
nations a day earlier, Lu said that in face of the threat of 1,000 Chinese
missiles, Taiwan insists on maintaining cross-strait peace, which she described
as a determining factor in the stability of the Pacific region.</P>
      <P>She said Taiwan hopes to join the international community and expects the world
to support the country's applications to join the United Nations and the World
Health Organization under the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, as an oceanic nation rather than an isolated island off China's coast,
has demonstrated its "soft power" and has made advanced progress in human
rights, democracy, peace, love for the world and high technology, she continued.</P>
      <P>Lauding  the  country's  economic  success  and  democratic achievements, Lu
said Taiwan's global competitiveness ranks 13th worldwide and 26th in terms of
economic freedom.</P>
      <P>Approximately 60 percent of the world's information technology products come
from Taiwan, she noted.</P>
      <P>Following the peaceful transfer of political power in 2000, Freedom House in the
U.S. places Taiwan among the highly democratic Western countries, Lu said.</P>
      <P>She added that Taiwan is not self-complacent and is willing to share its
achievements  and experiences with the international community, urging the
participants to back the country's U.N. and WHO bids.</P>
      <P>Lu is the founder and chairwoman of the DPU, a non-governmental organization
that aims to serve as a platform for exchanges among the Pacific Rim countries
in the promotion of democracy, peace and prosperity, and other common values.</P>
      <P>Founded in Taipei Aug. 14, 2005, the DPU has 26 countries and areas as permanent
members.</P>

Nicaragua hopes to boost its ties with all countries around the world despite
political and ideological differences, Morales said.</P>
      <P>He hailed Lu as a dynamic promoter of the DPU, which gathered together
representatives of 33 countries around the Pacific Rim at the event.</P>
      <P>According to Morales, Nicaragua has begun a process of national reconciliation,
giving priority  to the problems  of poverty, unemployment and education.</P>
      <P>To attain the goal, the most important thing is domestic and foreign private
investment, Morales said, adding that Nicaragua welcomes any investment that
will lead to social, employment and environmental improvement in his country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ex-U.S. official urges U.S. to restore diplomatic ties with ROC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14 (CNA)
08/14/07  21:54:50
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former U.S. Representative to the United Nations John Bolton said Tuesday that
the United States should "expand or restore" its diplomatic  relations with
Taiwan and suggested Taiwan to try to seek the repeal or modification of U.N.
Resolution 2758.</P>
      <P>Bolton also expressed his disappointment at what he described as U.N. Secretary-
General Ban Ki-moon's "massive error" in rejecting Taiwan 's application for
U.N. membership without submitting it to the member governments.</P>
      <P>"The U.S. needs to take a decisive step -- the restoration of full diplomatic
relations with Taiwan -- to avoid the situation becoming riskier and more
dangerous for the U.S. as well as the PRC and the ROC, " Bolton said in a speech
titled "U.S. Global Democracy Strategy and Cooperation with Taiwan."</P>
      <P>What former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. George H.W. Bush proposed in 1971 as
"dual representation" should "make sense now" as "dual recognition, " he said.</P>
      <P>"Recognizing Taiwan in fact is simply recognizing reality, which is always the
best grounding for any foreign policy, " he said.</P>
      <P>By recognizing Taiwan, the ambiguity will be eliminated, he said, offering his
opinion that ambiguity is a negative for the U.S. rather than a plus.</P>
      <P>The ambiguity encourages China to believe it might actually conquer Taiwan
without waging a war, he explained. Recognition would bring stability and
certainty as well as strengthen the U.S. hand in the region by signalling to
others the U.S. commitment to Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>As for China's response to dual recognition, Bolton said there is "no way" China
would break its relations with the U.S. nor impose economic costs.</P>
      <P>"They will not be happy... But Beijing will not take any substantial steps, " he
speculated.</P>
      <P>Bolton went on to suggest that in terms of U.N. status, the real answer for
Taiwan is to seek the repeal of U.N. Resolution 2758 because "applying for
regular membership will produce a PRC veto if it gets that far."</P>
      <P>"If the U.N. General Assembly can pass Resolution 2758, it can repeal it or
modify it, " he pointed out, adding that prior UNGA resolutions have been
repealed or modified.</P>
      <P>Ban Ki-moon  has rejected  both Taiwan's  U.N.  membership applications and its
effort to accede to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination against Women treaty, which constitutes a huge mistake by Ban,
according to Bolton.</P>
      <P>As Ban was elected U.N. Secretary-General with the help of China and the U.S.,
the U.S. is observing which direction will Ban take if there is a dispute
between China and the U.S., Bolton said.</P>
      <P>"He went to the direction of China in his first test, " he said.</P>
      <P>For the U.N. application name issue and referendum, Bolton said the name is for
the people of Taiwan to decide. While the referendum is a mechanism to reflect
popular choice, it is anomalous for the U.S. to object to people voting in a
referendum after all the pressure to make Taiwan a democracy, he said.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead to the presidential elections in Taiwan and the U.S., Bolton said
the U.S. presidential candidates should publicly commit to "no deals over Taiwan
without the consent of the people" while Taiwanese candidates should make sure
they "get the best deal possible" for the people.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun urged prosecutors
Tuesday to appeal the case of Ma Ying-jeou, the main opposition Kuomintang's
(KMT) presidential candidate, after Ma was acquitted of corruption charges by
the Taipei District Court.</P>
      <P>Yu issued the call at a news conference with key party officials after the
Taipei District Court handed down a not guilty verdict on Ma earlier that same
day.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the ruling is biased and does not serve justice or convince  the
public,  given evidence "clearly  showing"  Ma's wrongdoing, Yu called on the
prosecution to seek an overturn of Ma's acquittal as quickly as possible so as
to close the case at an early date.</P>
      <P>Echoing the DPP chief's call, Yin Ling-ying, a legislative caucus whip of the
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), an ally of the DPP in the "pan-green camp," said
the caucus fully supports an appeal by Prosecutor Hou Kuan-jen who indicted Ma
Feb. 13 over corruption charges.</P>
      <P>Yin accused the judiciary of "wallowing in degeneration" and claimed that the
Taiwan people will not accept such a ruling.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at the KMT headquarters, KMT Chairman Wu Poh-
hsiung expressed happiness with Ma's acquittal on embezzlement charges and said
it will help inject momentum to Ma's election campaign.</P>
      <P>Wu Poh-hsiung said he strongly believes in Ma's clean reputation and added that
prosecutors' indictment accusing Ma of using his position to rack up personal
monetary advantages sent a shockwave through society.</P>
      <P>For his part, KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yih urged prosecutors to apply the
same criteria by launching probes into similar cases involving four DPP
heavyweights -- Vice President Annette Lu, former Premier Frank Hsieh who now is
the DPP's presidential candidate, and former Premier Su Tseng-chang.</P>
      <P>Ma was indicted by prosecutors Feb. 13 after ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP)  lawmakers sued him over his alleged mishandling of public funds
related to the reimbursement of a special mayoral allowance earmarked for his
discretionary use when he was mayor of Taipei during the 1998-2006 period.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu of the DPP said Ma's acquittal is proof that
the ruling party cannot and did not manipulate the judiciary.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed her hope that same standard can be applied to deal with similar
cases in the future, regardless of political affiliation of the accused.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin of the KMT hailed the judges' ruling as fair and said
he is happy Ma's name has been cleared.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference following a municipal meeting, Hau said the
verdict did not fail to meet the public's expectations and that Ma's acquittal
will help clear barriers on his way to the presidency.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court's ruling,  although it might be overturned by the High
Court and the Supreme Court, had a major impact on Taiwanese politics, because
only a few months are left before the Jan.  12 legislative  elections  and the
March 22 presidential election, analysts said.</P>
      <P>If prosecutors decide to appeal, the High Court has to come up with a verdict
within six months -- right when the presidential poll is to be held, which will
cast a shadow over Taiwan's political stability at an extremely sensitive time,
the analysts said.</P>

      <P>A U.K. helicopter company is looking to expand its business to Taiwan, as the
country has slowly opened up its domestic civil and corporate aviation market.</P>
      <P>AgustaWestland, which specializes in helicopters and related training, has a
tender for the National Airborne Service Corps' (NASC's) procurement of 12
helicopters to be used for search and rescue, disaster relief and emergency
medical services.</P>
      <P>The company sees Taiwan as a future market with tremendous potential although
the expansion will be slow and steady, said Andrew Symonds, vice general manager
of sales in North Asia.</P>
      <P>Symonds said the company's AW-139 and EH-101 models are suited for Taiwan's
mountainous areas and the high winds often experienced in rescue and relief
missions and added that the company is happy to collaborate with Taiwanese
government agencies.</P>
      <P>The main focus will be on civil services, later expanding to corporate services
and air taxi operations, Symonds said.</P>
      <P>AgustaWestland is a subsidiary of Finmeccanica, which is the ninth-largest
aerospace, defense and security company globally and the second-largest in
Europe. The company has its primary operations in Italy, the U.K. and the U.S.</P>

      <P>According to the county government's estimate, as of late Tuesday, agricultural
losses due to the rain had increased to a total of more than NT$100 million
(US$3.03 million).</P>
      <P>Among the crops that suffered the greatest damage were bananas, melons and leafy

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate said in
Jakarta Tuesday that he is likely to announce his running mate upon his return
to Taiwan if he gets a positive response from his target choice.</P>
      <P>Frank Hsieh told Taiwanese reporters covering his Southeast Asian tour that he
talked with former Premier Su Tseng-chang on the phone a day earlier.</P>
      <P>"During our conversation, Su said he will give a goodwill response to my
invitation to serve as my running mate out of his desire to do what's best for
the country, " Hsieh said, adding: "Even though our talks did not come to a
conclusion, I'm convinced that the outcome will be a good one."</P>
      <P>Hsieh said in Singapore Sunday that he had invited Su to run for the vice
presidency in 2008.</P>
      <P>The lawyer-turned-politician  was scheduled to conclude his Indonesia visit
Wednesday, which is also the date he has promised to announce his running mate.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he will not make a formal announcement aboard his return flight. "But
if I secure a definite reply, I'm very likely to announce the formation of a
Hsieh-Su ticket upon my arrival at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport," he
added.</P>
      <P>Hsieh was originally scheduled to announce his running mate at a rally to be
held at 228 Peace Park in downtown Taipei Wednesday evening. As recent
torrential rains have wreaked havoc in southern Taiwan -- the DPP's traditional
stronghold, Hsieh said the rally will be postponed indefinitely. "The time and
venue for the replacement rally will be decided later, " he said, adding that
despite the postponement, he will announce his running mate as scheduled.</P>
      <P>Hsieh arrived in Jakarta Monday after concluding a three-day visit to Singapore
during which he met with Singapore's top leaders, including Prime Minister Lee
Hsieh Loong and Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew.</P>
      <P>Hsieh met with Indonesia Vice President Jusuf Kalla Monday evening. On Tuesday,
he attended seminars with Indonesian business executives and legal scholars and
experts as well as took part in a charitable activity hosted by the wife of
Indonesian vice president.</P>
      <P>Hsieh held talks with Indonesian Industry Minister Fahmi Idris at noon. Hsieh
assured Idris that if he wins the presidency, he will work for expanded Taiwan-
Indinesian ties. Hsieh also met with Indonesian parliamentarians in the
afternoon. In the evening, he attended a dinner given by the Taiwanese
expatriates association in his honor.</P>

      <P>Two Chinese citizens convicted of attempting to commandeer a passenger plane by
holding hostage a Taiwanese official and injuring him in 1999 were repatriated
to China via the Taiwan-held outlying island of Matsu Tuesday after serving out
their prison terms.</P>
      <P>Yang Mingde and Lin Wenqiang were escorted to Matsu aboard a police helicopter
early in the morning, from where they were taken back to China on a Chinese
boat, escorted by Chinese public security personnel.</P>
      <P>In exchange, the Chinese security personnel handed over 11 wanted Taiwanese
fugitives to officials from Taiwan's Criminal Investigation Burea.</P>
      <P>Yang and Lin were among 18 Chinese citizens imprisoned in Taiwan for hijacking
passenger  planes from China during a spate of hijackings between 1993 and 1998.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) officials said Tuesday that only one convicted
hijacker, Wang Zhihua, remains imprisoned in Taiwan, as 15 others were
repatriated previously.</P>
      <P>Yang and Lin were to have been repatriated in 1999 via another Taiwan-held
outlying island -- Kinmen -- but the pair tried to commandeer the plane taking
them to Kinmen in a last-ditch attempt to avoid being returned. The duo and two
others had hidden sharpened pieces of metal in their clothes and planned to
demand the plane be flown to the United States.</P>
      <P>Their attempt was thwarted and they were returned to Taiwan to face new charges.
In their action, Jan Jyh-horng, then-deputy secretary-general of the quasi-
official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , were held hostage at one point and
injured in the incident. Jan is now MAC chief secretary.</P>

      <P>Higher education has entered the era of global learning, featuring international
exchanges and cooperation, a local university president has said, citing the
recent academic links between National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) and higher
education institutes in Latin America as an example.</P>
      <P>NCTU President Wu Chung-yu made the remarks Monday while hosting a discussion on
the development of higher education in connection with the second annual
conference of the Democratic Pacific Union, which opened earlier the same day.</P>
      <P>Wu said that through the research exchange program, students from Latin American
countries will be able to receive technical and vocational training with the
country's two world-famous contract chip makers, Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Corp.(TSMC) and United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC).</P>
      <P>Wu indicated that over the past years, higher education has had a profound and
far-reaching influence on the development of Taiwan's wafer and IC technology,
and that given the tendency toward globalization, high education needs to
further develop and upgrade through  the  integrated  efforts  of  international
research professionals to facilitate national development.</P>
      <P>Kim Shin Bok, vice president of Seoul National University, also said  that
higher  education  institutes  should  establish  a world-recognized  and
object-oriented evaluation system for the assessment of educational achievements
in order to provide quality certificates for the reference of parents, students,
enterprises and government.</P>
      <P>Kim stressed such a system will help boost competitiveness and stimulate quality
improvement among higher education institutes.</P>
      <P>The Korean university vice president noted that a lot of international
organizations have set up their own evaluation systems, including the U.S.-based
Council of Higher Education Accreditation, the National Institute for Academic
Degrees and University Evaluation in Japan and the Australian University Quality
Agency.</P>
      <P>Kim further suggested that the World Bank provide technical and financial
support for Asia-Pacific countries to set up their own accreditation systems or
establish an international system.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that he looks forward to the 2nd Taiwan-
Pacific Allies summit slated to take place in Majuro, capital of the Marshall
Islands, in October.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while receiving Palau Vice President Elias Camsek Chin,
Marshall Islands First Lady Mary N. Note and Tuvalu parliamentary speaker Kamuta
Latasi at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Chen warmly welcomed the visiting dignities to the country, who have come to
attend the second assembly of the Democratic Pacific Union (DPU) -- a non-
governmental organization inaugurated in August 2005 to boost democracy,  peace,
prosperity  in Pacific  Rim democracies. The DPU is a brainchild of Vice
President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>Palau, the Marshall Islands, and Tuvalu are three of Taiwan's best diplomatic
allies, Chen said, noting that the three dignitaries' coming to Taiwan for the
DPU assembly indicates that the three countries highly value the DPU.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed hope that the 2nd Taiwan-Pacific Allies Summit would help flesh
out the "Palau Declaration" signed by Chen and his counterparts from the
Republic of China's six South Pacific allies in Palau Sept. 4, 2006 at the
conclusion of the first-ever leadership summit between Taiwan and its six South
Pacific allies -- Palau, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, the Solomon Islands,
Kiribati and Tuvalu.</P>
      <P>The declaration recognizes Taiwan's achievements in political democratization
and economic development, and pledges that all of Taiwan's Pacific allies will
fully support Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations, the World Health
Organization and other major international organizations and activities.</P>
      <P>With their shared values of democracy and human rights, all of the signatories
agreed to strengthen cooperation in three major fields -- manpower cultivation,
economic development and social culture promotion.</P>

      <P>A U.K. helicopter company is looking to expand its business to Taiwan, as the
country has slowly opened up its domestic civil and corporate aviation market.</P>
      <P>AgustaWestland, which specializes in helicopters and related training, has a
tender for the National Airborne Service Corps' (NASC's) procurement of 12
helicopters to be used for search and rescue, disaster relief and emergency
medical services.</P>
      <P>The company sees Taiwan as a future market with tremendous potential although
the expansion will be slow and steady, said Andrew Symonds, vice general manager
of sales in North Asia.</P>
      <P>Symonds said the company's AW-139 and EH-101 models are suited for Taiwan's
mountainous areas and the high winds often experienced in rescue and relief
missions and added that the company is happy to collaborate with Taiwanese
government agencies.</P>
      <P>The main focus will be on civil services, later expanding to corporate services
and air taxi operations, Symonds said.</P>
      <P>AgustaWestland is a subsidiary of Finmeccanica, which is the ninth-largest
aerospace, defense and security company globally and the second-largest in
Europe. The company has its primary operations in Italy, the U.K. and the U.S.</P>

      <P>Pingtung County, Taiwan's southernmost county, has suffered the heaviest
agricultural losses in the country as a result of torrential rain over the past
few days, county government officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the county government's estimate, as of late Tuesday, agricultural
losses due to the rain had increased to a total of more than NT$100 million
(US$3.03 million).</P>
      <P>Among the crops that suffered the greatest damage were bananas, melons and leafy
vegetables.</P>
      <P>The aquaculture sector recorded a loss of NT$2 million, with many fish ponds
completely inundated and having lost all their fish.</P>
      <P>The flooding had also drowned 290,000 chickens, washed away 40,000 ducks and
killed 800 hogs, with losses amounting to NT$17 million.</P>
      <P>The rain was brought to Taiwan by southwesterly air currents that came in the
wake of two tropical storms -- Pabuk and Wutip -- which swept across Taiwan last
week.</P>
      <P>Machia township in Pingtung County saw record rainfall of more than 1,000 mm

      <P>Higher education has entered the era of global learning, featuring international
exchanges and cooperation, a local university president has said, citing the
recent academic links between National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) and higher
education institutes in Latin America as an example.</P>
      <P>NCTU President Wu Chung-yu made the remarks Monday while hosting a discussion on
the development of higher education in connection with the second annual
conference of the Democratic Pacific Union, which opened earlier the same day.</P>
      <P>Wu said that through the research exchange program, students from Latin American
countries will be able to receive technical and vocational training with the
country's two world-famous contract chip makers, Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Corp.(TSMC) and United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC).</P>
      <P>Wu indicated that over the past years, higher education has had a profound and
far-reaching influence on the development of Taiwan's wafer and IC technology,
and that given the tendency toward globalization, high education needs to
further develop and upgrade through  the  integrated  efforts  of  international
research professionals to facilitate national development.</P>
      <P>Kim Shin Bok, vice president of Seoul National University, also said  that
higher  education  institutes  should  establish  a world-recognized  and
object-oriented evaluation system for the assessment of educational achievements
in order to provide quality certificates for the reference of parents, students,
enterprises and government.</P>
      <P>Kim stressed such a system will help boost competitiveness and stimulate quality
improvement among higher education institutes.</P>
      <P>The Korean university vice president noted that a lot of international
organizations have set up their own evaluation systems, including the U.S.-based
Council of Higher Education Accreditation, the National Institute for Academic
Degrees and University Evaluation in Japan and the Australian University Quality
Agency.</P>
      <P>Kim further suggested that the World Bank provide technical and financial
support for Asia-Pacific countries to set up their own accreditation systems or
establish an international system.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) unveiled Tuesday its plan to relax a ban on
ractopamine in livestock to permit low residue levels of the veterinary drug in
pigs and cattle.</P>
      <P>According to a proposed revision to the DOH's standards for veterinary drug
residues, the maximum allowable level of ractopamine residue in pigs and cattle
would be 10 ppb in muscle and fat tissue, 40 ppb in the liver, and 90 ppb in the
kidneys.</P>
      <P>If the proposal meets no objection by Aug. 21, the new standards can be
implemented at the end of the month at the earliest, DOH officials said.</P>
      <P>Cheng Hui-wen, director of the DOH's Bureau of Food Safety, said the DOH is
planning to adopt the standards recommended by the Codex Alimenterius
Commission,  a body established by the Food and Agriculture Organization and the
World Health Organization, after reviewing  the ractopamine  residue  criteria
of international organizations and 24 countries where the use of ractopamine is
permitted, including the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia and New
Zealand.</P>
      <P>Even after the ban is relaxed, the standards to be adopted by Taiwan would
remain the strictest among those countries, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Ractopamine,  marketed under the brand name Paylean, is a phenolethanolamine
s-adrenoceptor agonist that is used for the improvement of weight gain, carcass
leanness and feed efficiency in animals, DOH officials noted.</P>
      <P>Studies have shown that the drug can be processed rapidly by animals and humans
and that the chances of long-term consumption of residue of the drug in meat
having toxicological effects are extremely slim, they said.</P>
      <P>The issue has received much public attention in the country since the DOH
rejected last month two shipments of U.S.-exported pork which was found to
contain ractopamine residue.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's total excess savings amounted to NT$5.46 trillion (US$165 billion) for
the last 10 years, Taipei-based Central Bank of China (CBC) Governor Perng Fai-
nan said Monday, adding that the problem will not go away and that it is
necessary to promote domestic investment.</P>
      <P>Perng made the remarks while delivering a report on the functions of the central
bank at a monthly Presidential Office meeting.</P>
      <P>Describing excess savings as one of the two major challenges facing the country,
Perng said that savings have been providing sufficient capital for the local
banking system over the years.</P>
      <P>According to Perng, the CBC has repeatedly been employing monetary policies and
tools -- including open-market operations and financial institutions' transfer
deposits -- to maintain currency growth at a moderate level to stabilize
consumer prices.</P>
      <P>While admitting that the central bank's measures will not resolve the problem of
excess savings, Perng suggested the promotion of domestic investment as a
possible solution.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the other challenge, Perng said it is difficult for the central bank
to strike a balance among stable exchange rates, free flows of capital, and
monetary policy autonomy.</P>
      <P>Globalization has led to a close integration of the world's financial markets,
Perng said, adding that total foreign exchange trade on the world market
amounted to US$1.9 trillion per day.</P>
      <P>"In the age of financial globalization, if one country's market is adversely
affected, the impact will immediately spread to the rest of the world," Perng
said.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Perng said the CBC is forced to follow in the steps of
its major foreign counterparts by adjusting interest rates as part of its
efforts to stabilize exchange rates and avoid massive international capital
movement due to a wide gap in interest rates in Taiwan and in other countries.</P>

      <P>A sea warning for Typhoon Sepat is expected to be issued Thursday at the
earliest as the typhoon has continued to increase in intensity and move toward
Taiwan, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>As of 10 a.m. Wednesday, Sepat was centered 1,100 km southeast of Taiwan, moving
west-northwesterly at 11 kph and packing maximum sustained winds of 175 kph, CWB
meteorologists said.</P>
      <P>The meteorologists forecast that Sepat, the eighth tropical storm reported in
the West Pacific area this year, may continue to gain strength to become a
strong typhoon over the next two days.</P>
      <P>The weather bureau urged residents around the island to be on high alert against
the new typhoon, which is very likely to make landfall in Taiwan based on its
current course,  adding that mountainous areas are now extremely vulnerable to
landslides due to the fact that the soil in these areas is saturated with water
in the wake of two tropical storms -- Pabuk and Wutip -- which swept across
Taiwan last week.</P>

      <P>The government has decided to make public a list of proposed sites for storage
of nuclear waste by the end of this year, a senior economic planner said Tuesday
in Taitung, southeastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ho Mei-yueh, minister of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, made
the remarks in a regular biannual meeting held with representatives of Orchid
Island residents as well as relevant scholars and experts to discuss relocation
of the radioactive waste storage site on the Orchid Island, operated by the
state-run Taiwan Power Co.</P>
      <P>Ho said that since the storage site on the island has been used for more than
two decades, the government will launch a comprehensive safety check of the
current nuclear waste stock, which amounts to around 90,000 barrels.</P>
      <P>Each barrel will be checked to make sure that the outer metal clothing has not
rusted and that the inner concrete seal has not loosened or degraded, Ho said,
noting that the safety check process is scheduled to be completed by 2010.</P>
      <P>In response to Orchid Island residents' demand for relocation of the nuclear
waste site away from their island,  the minister underlined that the government
will make public a list of suggested sites by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Local referendums will then be organized in each of the cities and counties
where the proposed sites are located, adding that none of the proposed sites
will be chosen without the approval of the local residents in such a vote.</P>

      <P>Just over 74 percent of child daycare centers inspected recently by the Consumer
Protection Commission (CPC) failed to meet the country's established safety
requirements, officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The inspection was carried out jointly by the CPC and the Ministry of the
Interior's Children Bureau between May and June among 172 child daycare
institutions around the country.</P>
      <P>According to consumer protection official Wang Teh-ming, a total of 128 of the
inspected institutions did not pass the evaluation, including 64 that failed in
the area of building safety and management, 64 that failed in the area of
firefighting safety and management, 72 that failed in the area of sanitary
safety and management, and 97 that failed in the area of administrative,
teaching and caregiving management.</P>
      <P>After these institutions were ordered to make improvements within a required
period of time, a second inspection found that 57 had failed to do so, Wang
said.</P>
      <P>Among the institutions failing in the category of firefighting safety and
management, 36 had defects in their emergency escape facilities, Wang said,
adding that food contamination was discovered in 21 institutions failing in the
category of sanitary safety and management.</P>
      <P>Chen Kun-huang, chief secretary of the Children's Bureau, noted that more than
284,000 children require daycare services and that there are more than 4,200
child daycare institutions in the country.</P>
      <P>Chen said the results of the government's annual evaluation of these
institutions are available on the bureau's official Web site, urging parents to
check the results before sending their children to any of these institutions.</P>
      <P>While selecting a daycare institution, parents should check whether the
institution is licensed and whether it is over-enrolled, he said, noting that
daycare institutions are required to provide one caregiver for every 15
children.</P>
      <P>In addition, he called parents' attention to the fact that daycare institutions
are not allowed to hire foreign teachers and that many institutions that tout
their language programs provided by foreign teachers are illegal.</P>

personality traits of a trailblazing leader, adding that unlike the opposition
Kuomintang presidential candidate, Ma Ying-jeou, and his running mate, Vincent
Siew -- a ticket which the DPP legislative whip claimed is considered "dull and
inconsequential" -- the Hsieh-Su ticket will be greater than the sum of its
parts.</P>
      <P>Ker added that all the members of the DPP legislative caucus as well as hundreds
of party members will meet Hsieh at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport to
welcome him home and express their support for the formation of a Hsieh-Su
ticket.</P>
      <P>Su, who was Hsieh's presidential primary rival, is currently in the United
States on a private visit. He is expected to return to Taiwan later this week.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NT$81.7 billion to be invested in care, service for seniors</HEADLINE>

      <P>The government will invest up to NT$81.7 billion over the next 10 years in
establishing a comprehensive care and service network for disabled elderly
people, an official with the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the official, Taiwan currently has an estimated 210,000 people aged
65 or over with physical limitations, and the number of people in this group is
expected to increase to 301,000 by 2015.</P>
      <P>As physically challenged seniors often have difficulty taking care of
themselves, they present a heavy burden to their families and on the
government's financial resources as well, the official said.</P>
      <P>The Paris-based Organization  for Economic Cooperation  and Development (OECD)
has foreseen a steep upward trend in expenditures on long-term care for seniors
with disabilities in all countries around the world, the official said.</P>
      <P>According to an OECD study, the ratio of such spending to a country's annual
gross domestic product (GDP) could surge from 1.1 percent in 2005 to 2.3 percent
in 2050.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan's population aging fast, the demand for long-term care has increased
steadily, the official said, adding that the government has drawn up a 10-year
plan to develop an inclusive service mechanism to offer better care for disabled
senior citizens.</P>
      <P>The beneficiaries of the service network will also include indigenous people
aged 55 or over as well as mentally or physically challenged individuals over 50
years of age, the official said.</P>
      <P>Under the current national health insurance program, elderly people who rely on
life-support systems but live at home are eligible for two free home visits by
medical personnel per month. Once the 10-year service system is launched, the
number of such visits will increase to four, the official said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the official said the government will invest in improving living
environments and introducing up-to-date technologies and devices to lower
incidence of chronic diseases and enable senior citizens to live independently
for a longer period of time.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday that the United States should not draw a
line in the sand with regard to Taiwan's democracy.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks to U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx, a Republican from
North Carolina, in reference to U.S. opposition to his plan to hold a referendum
on the country's bid to join the United Nations alongside the 2008 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>"The United States opposes any initiative that appears designed to change
Taiwan's status unilaterally.  This would include a referendum on whether to
apply to the United Nations under the name of Taiwan, " a U.S. State Department
spokesman said recently when asked to comment on the issue.</P>
      <P>According to Chen,  holding a referendum is the "gist of democracy, " noting
that in the United States, there are all sorts of referendums being held
alongside national or local elections. In Taiwan, a national referendum took
place for the first time in 2004.</P>
      <P>The president said the United States should not draw a line in the sand on
Taiwan's democracy, otherwise, the people of Taiwan will be unable to enjoy
complete democracy.</P>
      <P>He said that "if the line is there, we'll do everything possible to avoid
treading on it. But while we act gingerly, if someone moves the line so that we
inadvertently step on it, it will not be fair to the people of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The president said the ruling Democratic Progressive Party has entered the
second-stage name collection on holding a referendum on Taiwan's bid to join the
United Nations, hoping that the bid to join the United Nations under the name of
Taiwan will gain the support of the majority.</P>
      <P>He noted that U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice recently said the United
States will support independence for Kosovo even if the United Nations Security
Council vetos the idea.</P>
      <P>He said this clear and unequivocal stance of the U.S. on Kosovo contrasted
sharply with Washington's opposition to his promotion of a U.N. referendum.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two Taiwan extreme endurance cyclists were scheduled to depart for France late
Wednesday to take part in the 1,200-km Paris-Brest-Paris randonneur -- a
grueling test of endurance and cycling ability and an event that has a history
of 116 years.</P>
      <P>Jack Ruan, 42, and Cheng Wen-chang, 57, will be the first two men from Taiwan to
take part in the randonneur slated for Aug. 20-24. It is the oldest non-
competitive bicycling event in the world still run on a regular basis on the
open road.</P>
      <P>First run in 1891, the 1,200-km Paris-Brest-Paris, or PBP as it is commonly
called, is organized every four years by the Audax Club Parisien.</P>
      <P>In the last PBP held in 2003, a record number of 4,069 cyclists took part, 3,457
of whom succeeded in the challenge while 612 failed. Japan was the only Asian
country to take part in the event that year, fielding 20 cyclists of whom 12
completed the course.</P>
      <P>Beginning on the southern side of the French capital, it travels west 600 km to
the port city of Brest on the Atlantic Ocean and returns along the same route.</P>
      <P>Although today's randonneur cyclists no longer ride the primitive machines used
100 years ago over dirt roads or cobblestones, they still have to face rough
weather, endless hills and pedalling around the clock.</P>
      <P>A 90-hour time limit ensures that only the hardiest randonneurs earn the
prestigious PBP finisher's medal and have their names entered into the event's
"Great Book" along with every other finisher going back to the very first PBP.</P>
      <P>Ruan,  currently financial controller and spokesman for an international cargo
express company in Taipei, is an amateur marathon runner who has taken part in
the 226-km Kenting Triathlon.</P>
      <P>Cheng, who retired as a teacher in 2005, founded the Kenting Triathlon last year
and continues to run marathons and do extreme endurance cycling, despite his
age.</P>
      <P>To qualify as the first Taiwanese riders to tackle the PBP and break the 90 hour
cut-off mark, Ruan and Cheng recently completed three races in Japan of 200 km,
300 km and 600 km brevets.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>As an independent and sovereign state, Taiwan has no interest in vying for
China's representation in the United Nations against the People's Republic of
China (PRC), Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks at a news conference at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
to explain Taiwan's efforts in seeking to join the United Nations, in response
to a proposal by John Bolton, a former U. S. ambassador to the world body, that
Taipei consider suggesting that the United Nations amend or repeal Resolution
2758.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, 15 of Taiwan's diplomatic partners have signed an
endorsement proposing that the U.N. Security Council deal with Taiwan's
membership application in its coming 62nd General Assembly, slated to open Sept.
18.</P>
      <P>The U.N. General Committee is expected to discuss Sept. 19 whether to list the
proposal for Taiwan's U.N. membership on the General Assembly 's agenda, he
said, and expressed his appreciation for the allies' support for Taiwan's U.N.
cause.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian wrote last month to U.N. Secretary- General Ban Ki-
moon, and put forward the country's application to enter the United Nations as
Taiwan instead of the Republic of China (ROC). But the application was turned
down by Ban, citing Resolution 2758 adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in
1971, which recognized the PRC as the sole legitimate government of China."</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on the suggestion by Bolton in Taipei Tuesday that Taiwan
demands the United Nations revise or scrap Resolution 2758, Huang replied that
Taiwan has no intention of joining the United Nations as the ROC and challenging
the PRC to vie for China's representation in the international organization.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is an independent and sovereign state and it is fully entitled to take
part in the United Nations, according to the U. N. charter, Huang said, adding
that the country is determined to join the United Nations under the name of
Taiwan so as to make it clear to the rest of the world that "Taiwan does not
form part of the PRC."</P>
      <P>Taiwan hopes to shed the historic and legal disputes of the past and enter the
United Nations as a new member, Huang said. He also questioned how the
international community will heed Taiwan's U.N. bid if the country itself fails
to assert its national sovereignty and statehood.</P>

      <P>The signing of a free trade agreement (FTA) between the United States and South
Korea might have a serious impact on the textile industry of Changhua County in
southern Taiwan, Changhua Magistrate Cho Po-yuan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The two countries signed an FTA June 30 that will help increase South Korea
exports to the United States in a variety of industries such as textiles and
will thus affect Changhua County's textile industry, said Cho.</P>
      <P>The county has 975 registered textile firms and is a stronghold of Taiwan's
textile business.</P>
      <P>The county's textile industry had been in decline for the past decade because of
competition from China's low-priced products, Cho said, adding that the industry
has seen some improvement in export orders since the United States set
limitations on import quotas for Chinese textile products this year.</P>
      <P>However, he added, the impact of the FTA between the United States and South
Korea might become evident from the end of this year, with more and more orders
being transferred to South Korea.</P>
      <P>Cho said the county government has the obligation to give advice and warnings in
this regard to local textile firms, and that the Changhua County Industrial
Development and Investment Promotion Committee and the county government's
Department of Economic Development have started gathering information for
reference by local business people.</P>
      <P>Department chief Huang Cho-chung said the two units have consulted the Taiwan
Textile Federation for useful information and are making an evaluation on the
possible impact of the U.S.-Korea FTA. They will also have meetings with textile
firm owners to provide counseling and listen to their opinions, in an effort to
propose measures to reduce the impact to the minimum.</P>

for their rights and benefits.</P>
      <P>On the day marking the 62nd anniversary of Japan's defeat in World War II, the
TWRF gathered young Taiwanese people for a parade to the Taipei Office of the
Interchange Association, Japan's liaison office in Taiwan, to demand an apology
and compensation for the victims from the Japanese government.</P>
      <P>The TWRF will never stop its assistance for the comfort women in claiming
Japanese compensation for their victimization, even though they lost a lawsuit
against the Japanese government two years ago in the Tokyo High Court, TWRF
executives said during the parade.</P>
      <P>The issue concerning comfort women has become a high-profile human rights issue
in the international community after the U.S. Congress passed a resolution in
early August urging Japan to make a full apology to wartime comfort women.</P>
      <P>In addition to the parade, the TWRF also launched a "one person, one letter"

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung announced Wednesday a government plan to establish a
national-level financial holding company by the end of this year to enhance the
overall competitiveness of Taiwan's financial sector.</P>
      <P>The new institution, named Taiwan Financial Holding, will comprise the three
completely state-owned financial institutions -- Bank of Taiwan, Land Bank of
Taiwan and Export-Import Bank of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Chang said that although many financial institutions  have reorganized to set up
holding companies over the past few years to improve efficiency and
competitiveness, they are facing intense challenges from international financial
holding groups that enjoy advantages such as a high international profile,
strong abilities in research, development and innovation, and a huge global
distribution footprint.</P>
      <P>After its establishment, the market share of Taiwan Financial Holding is
expected to exceed 10 percent in the country, with its asset value ranking 18th
in Asia and 89th in the world, Chang said.</P>
      <P>According to Deputy Minister of Finance Liu Teng-cheng, the ministry will
complete a merger of the three state-owned financial institutions within three
years after the financial holding company is established.</P>
      <P>In the first phase of the plan, a securities subsidiary and a life insurance
subsidiary will be set up under the financial holding company when it is
established by the end of this year, Liu said.</P>
      <P>In the second phase, which is aimed to be completed in 12-18 months, the Export-
Import Bank will be merged with Bank of Taiwan and an insurance company will be
set up to take over the insurance business currently operated by the Export-
Import Bank, Liu said.</P>
      <P>In the third phase, which will be completed in two to three years, the Land Bank
of Taiwan will be merged with Bank of Taiwan and the real estate worth over
NT$100 billion owned by the two banks might be sold or taken over by a new
subsidiary, the minister said, adding that another subsidiary might also be set
up to take over the government procurement business that has in turn been taken
over by Bank of Taiwan from Central Trust of China.</P>
      <P>He estimated that the asset value of Taiwan Financial Holding will reach
US$158.8 billion.</P>
      <P>As for other financial institutions in which the government has a dominant
stake, the ministry will continue to encourage them to merge with other
institutions or sell their government-owned stock to private investors,
including foreign investors, he said.</P>

      <P>The credit quality of Taiwan's top 50 corporations is good and expected to be

credit ratings company said in a report released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Standard and Poor's Ratings Services (S&amp;P) and its subsidiary Taiwan Ratings
Co. (TRC) published the report on the rating outlook for Taiwan's top-tier

      <P>The high-tech sector comprises the largest ratio of the nation's top 50 firms,
accounting for 58 percent of the total, followed by the plastic, steel,
telecommunications, aerospace, petroleum, shipping and transportation, retail
and electric power industries, the study shows.</P>
      <P>The top three high-tech firms continued to play dominant roles in the market,
taking advantage of their technical edges, good relations with clients and low
cost structures, while coping with competition by seeking technology upgrades
and increasing capital expenditure, according to the report.</P>
      <P>The credit quality of the top 50 shows continued improvement, with financial
conditions growing stronger, including the ratio of cash-flow to debt, the TRC
said, predicting that top-tier companies will maintain their stable credit
quality this year, or even achieve slightly better performance.</P>
      <P>With the growing importance of economy of scale, large-scale companies will
particularly be able to better maintain their credit profiles as their operating
performances will not easily be affected by domestic economic developments,
according to the TRC report.</P>
      <P>Improving financial structure, taking measures to respond to economic cycles and
making meticulous financial plans and investments are key to maintaining

      <P>Seven lawmakers from across the party spectrum  arrived  at the United States
Tuesday to conduct a feasibility study for a submarine procurement deal.</P>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker Liao Wan-ju said the purpose of the
visit is to learn about the production capacity of U.S. submarine manufacturers
and the attitude of the U.S. government toward the deal.</P>
      <P>The group hopes to "obtain the best submarines for Taiwan at the most reasonable
price," according to Liao.</P>
      <P>Members of the group also include KMT legislators Shuai Hua-ming and Su Chi, Fu
Kun-chi of the opposition People First Party, Ho Ming-hao of the opposition
Taiwan Solidarity Union and Chang Hua-kuan and Shen Fa-hui of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>On speculation that the group could also make a feasibility study on E-2
aircraft and other arms procurement deals, Liao said the group wants to keep the
mission simple and will not include other feasibly studies "in principle."</P>
      <P>Ho also said they have tight schedule and that it will be a "mission-oriented
and professional" visit.</P>
      <P>In addition to visiting the Pentagon and other related U.S. government agencies,
they will also visit four submarine manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Due to the media criticism prior to the group's departure that the trip is a
waste of taxpayers' money, the legislators have to foot part of their travel
expenses out of their own pockets. The remaining fees will be paid by the
Ministry of National Defense and the Legislative Yuan, None of the expenditure
will come from the NT$200 million (US$6.06 million) budget set aside for
assessing the feasibility of the submarine deal or the most suitable type of
vessel for Taiwan's needs.</P>
      <P>The group traveled to Washington Wednesday and will also visit Boston as well as

as a result of the rain had amounted to NT$227.62 million (US$6.89 million).</P>
      <P>Among the crops that suffered the heaviest damage are bananas, melons and leafy
vegetables, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The aquaculture sector recorded losses of NT$2.72 million, with scores of
fishponds completely inundated and having incurred the loss of all their fish,
according to the officials.</P>
      <P>The flooding, the officials added, had also drowned 271,000 chickens, 33,000
ducks and 14,000 geese, with losses adding up to NT$16.29 million.</P>
      <P>The rain was brought to Taiwan by southwesterly air currents that came in the
wake of two tropical storms -- Pabuk and Wutip -- which churned across Taiwan
last week.</P>
      <P>Machia township in Pingtung County saw record rainfall of more than 1,000 mm
within 24 hours Monday, while other townships recorded between 500 mm and 700 mm
of rain in a 24-hour period.</P>

      <P>An 80-member team from the Eden Social Welfare Foundation and the Nan Shan Life
Charity Foundation will depart from Taipei Aug. 18 on a trip around Taiwan to
raise funds to buy wheelchairs for disabled children.</P>
      <P>Wang Kai-chiang, chairman of the Eden Foundation, told a press conference
Wednesday that the 80 volunteer workers will travel on bicycles during the
14-day journey and that they will be led by Hsieh Ching-kuei, a disabled man who
will ride with them in an electric wheelchair.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the team will take the No. 1 Provincial Highway and stop in
15 cities and townships, including Hsinchu, Taichung, Nantou, Chiayi, Tainan,
Kaohsiung, Hualien, Yilan and Keelung. They will be joined by other cyclists
along the way, including local government officials, employees of Nan Shan Life
Insurance Co. and other supporters.</P>
      <P>The goal of the team is to muster enough funds to buy 500 wheelchairs for
disabled children.</P>
      <P>The bike tour is part of the Eden Foundation's fund-raising campaign launched
last month to purchase wheelchairs for the disabled and canes for the blind. The
fund-raising campaign is a continuation of the foundation's "Love Without
Borders" project initiated in 1996 to help people with disabilities around the
world.</P>
      <P>Under this project, the foundation has given away nearly 10,000 wheelchairs
worth NT$80 million to disabled people in 20 countries.</P>
      <P>The foundation will hold three fund-raising dinners -- one each in Taichung,
Kaohsiung and Tainan -- on Aug. 24, 25, and 26, respectively, at NT$2,000 per
plate.</P>
      <P>It has set a target of mustering NT$12 million (US$362,406) ) to buy 500
wheelchairs for disabled adults and 1,250 white canes for visually impaired
people.</P>
      <P>The Eden Foundation was founded in 1982 by the late Liu Hsia, a female
wheelchair-bound writer who suffered from rheumatic arthritis, with a small
office and only two employees. It has evolved into an institution employing
1,200 people, with 65 service centers in 20 cities and counties around Taiwan
and branch offices in Malaysia and Vietnam.</P>

      <P>Scores of works by woodcarving masters from Lukang township in Changhua County
are on display at Yilan County's National Center for Traditional Arts along with
other exhibits at the Taiwan Woodcraft Exhibition.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the center urged the public Wednesday not to miss the
opportunity to see these woodcarving masterpieces, saying that the exhibition
will last until Sept. 23.</P>
      <P>Among others, five of Lukang's nationally renowned woodcarving masters have put
their works on display at the exhibition: Shih Cheng-yang, Huang Ma-ching, Huang
Huan-wen, Huang Sha-jung and Chen Mien-mo. Their works cover nearly all aspects
of life in Taiwan, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Woodcraft Exhibition, which opened July 1,  is displaying some 250
works by dozens of Taiwan's most accomplished woodcarvers.</P>
      <P>The exhibits in the main pavilion  of the center include traditional and modern
works of art, as well as works by mountain aborigines.</P>
      <P>Four other pavilions are devoted separately to toys, tools, furniture and
musical instruments -- all made of wood.</P>
      <P>Conspicuous among other exhibits are works by Chen Cheng-hsiung, a 65-year-old
woodcarving master from Tainan in southern Taiwan who has devoted himself to
woodcarving since the age of 14.</P>
      <P>Chen has created only about 100 works in his 50-year career, with each work
taking five to 10 years to complete. Most of his works have already been bought
by collectors.</P>
      <P>Some of the collectors agreed to lend their works to the exhibition, including a
few items priced at more than NT$8 million (US$243,080).</P>

      <P>Taiwan made public Wednesday its gratitude to 15 diplomatic allies for their
assistance in the country's latest bid to join the United Nations, after they
jointly endorsed a proposal requesting that Taiwan's application for U.N.
membership be treated impartially.</P>
      <P>In a news release, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) stated that the
proposal, delivered to the U.N. General Assembly Tuesday, requested that the
assembly press the Security Council to "equitably handle Taiwan's application
for membership in accordance with the Rules of Procedure."</P>
      <P>The U.N. General Assembly is scheduled to start its 62nd session Sept. 18 in New
York. The 15 allies will request that the proposal be listed as a supplementary
item on the General Assembly's agenda.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the matter will be discussed at the General Committee
meeting to be held Sept. 19, according to MOFA.</P>
      <P>This year President Chen Shui-bian for the first time submitted the membership
application to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon . However, the U.N.
Secretariat flatly denied the application, citing U.N. Resolution 2758 as the
reason.</P>
      <P>Taiwan issued a strong protest at the action and asked the U.N. Secretariat to
"correct" its stance, the MOFA said in the news release.</P>
      <P>The MOFA also reiterated its interpretation that Resolution 2758 neither
mentions anything about Taiwan nor provides China the right to represent the
people of Taiwan in the U.N.</P>
      <P>The proposal on Taiwan's U.N. bid, raised by the country's allies, aims to urge
U.N. members to look at Taiwan's right and need to join  the international
organization,  while  demonstrating determination to promote the bid, the news
release said.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said he is willing to promote the establishment of a
world environmental organization with people of insight from the rest of the
world, especially member countries of the Democratic Pacific Union (DPU).</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks Tuesday while attending the second assembly of DPU,
attended by nearly 100 foreign guests from 33 nations, in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>Founded in 2005, the DPU, an international body initiated and currently chaired
by Vice President Annette Lu, aims at promoting "democracy, peace, and
prosperity" in the Asian Pacific region and the world.</P>
      <P>Chen spoke of his hope of helping  to initiate  a world environmental
organization integrating international powers to deal with environmental
changes, challenges, and protection.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has made regular contributions to the world in many respects, Chen said,
adding that the nation is willing to share its development  experience  with
other countries and make further contributions.</P>
      <P>Chen mentioned that the rise of China involves an imbalance of economic growth,
high levels of environmental pollution,  the oppression of democratic movements

regional and world peace.</P>
      <P>It is the indispensable duty of the DPU to ensure that the economic development

    <TEXT>
      <P>Local hog farmers will demonstrate Aug. 21 in front of the Department of Health
(DOH) and the Taipei office of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) to protest
a DOH decision to ease a ban on ractopamine -- an animal drug that promotes
growth of lean meat in pigs or cattle-- under the U.S. pressure, one of their
leaders said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at the Legislative Yuan called by lawmakers, Yang
Her-pei, vice chairman of the Republic of China Swine Association, said that pig
farmers are set to stage the demonstration or even vote in the coming
legislative and presidential elections against the political parties that
disregard the health of Taiwan's people and farmers' livelihoods, if the DOH
fails to rescind its decision to remove the ban in the coming days.</P>
      <P>The DOH announced Tuesday evening that it will ease its ban to allow a limited
use of the animal drug, which was listed last year by the Cabinet-level Council
of Agriculture (COA) as a banned drug, despite repeated assurances that it would
not do so after two shipments of U.S. pork were found last month to contain
ractopamine.</P>
      <P>Yang suspected that the DOH's decision to relax the ban was a result of pressure
from the United States to clear barriers to its pork imports.</P>
      <P>"Local hog farmers cannot accept this decision which will allow the United
States to dump pork containing an illegal substance in Taiwan," he said.</P>
      <P>Cheng  Hui-wen,  director-general  of the DOH's Bureau  of Sanitation, denied
allegation that the DOH's decision to remove the ban on ractompaine was due to
U.S. concerns.</P>
      <P>Cheng cited the latest scientific evaluation as explaining that some kinds of
ractopamine are not harmful to human health and thus raise no food safety
concerns for consumers.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Solidarity Union lawmakers Yin Ling-ying and Liao Pen-yen,, and main
opposition Kuomintang lawmaker Ker Chun-hsiung, threatened to freeze next year's
budgets allocated for the DOH and asked Cheng to step down from his post after
hearing his explanation.</P>
      <P>Yu Kai-hsiung, secretary-general of the Consumers' Foundation, accused Cheng of
failing to provide solid evidence to back his rhetoric and said that his
foundation will launch a campaign urging local consumers to boycott U.S. pork.</P>
      <P>Yu accused the DOH of kow-towing to the United States and described its decision
to lift the ban on ractopamine as a "sinister deal" that lacks substantial
approval by experts and that will put consumers' health and farmers' livelihoods
at great risk.</P>
      <P>According to Yu, the Consumers' Foundation will lend its support for pig
farmers' demonstration next week to protest the government's softening of its
stance regarding the veterinary drug.</P>
      <P>Later the same day, an AIT spokesman denied allegation that the institute has
pressured Taiwan's authorities to remove the ban.</P>
      <P>The AIT is responsible for U.S. dealings with Taiwan in the absence of
diplomatic relations between the two countries.</P>

      <P>Tainan City was top while Keelung City was bottom in a nationwide assessment of
barrier-free facilities for pedestrians, Interior Minister Lee Yi-yang said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lee said the ministry commissioned an educational foundation to assess the
barrier-free facilities on roads and in parks in the 25 cities and counties, and
139 cities and townships with populations of over 50,000.</P>
      <P>The foundation based its assessment on the criteria of "safety, comfort and
accessibility," Lee said.</P>
      <P>In the urban group, Tainan is followed by Kaohsiung and Chiayi cities, while
Keelung and Hsinchu cities are ranked bottom and second from the bottom.</P>
      <P>In the rural group, Yunlin, Taichung and Miaoli counties are the best, while
Hsinchu, Nantou and Pingtung counties need to be improved.</P>
      <P>In the group encompassing remote regions and outlying islands, Taitung and
Penghu counties rank first and second, with Matsu at the bottom.</P>
      <P>Lee said the ministry will cut subsidies for the cities and counties that ranked
bottom in each group by 20 percent, using the money to encourage those on top in
each group so that city and county governments will be willing to invest more in
creating better environments for pedestrians.</P>

      <P>A forum organized by academics with the purpose to boost Taiwan's
competitiveness was formed Wednesday in Taipei, according to the organizers.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, former Premier Tang Fei, Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Hung Chi-chang and several business and
industrial leaders attended the inauguration ceremony held in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Lin Chien-fu, convener of the forum organized by some 50 professors specialized
in economics and public policies, said at the press conference  that Taiwan
urgently  needs to elevate  its competitiveness whether it moves toward
unification with China, independence or maintaining the status quo, which is why
he and his professor friends set up the forum to allow the participants to
pounder constructive public policies for the country.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the professors are neither supporters of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) nor of the opposition "pan-blue alliance" and are fed up
with the political bickering among the different political parties.</P>
      <P>Tang, who organized recently a political group aimed at "saving" Taiwan's
future, noted that some 4 million people cast deliberately spoiled ballots or
chose not to vote at all in the 2004 presidential election, which in Tang's view
represented people's disgust with Taiwan politics. Tang said something has to be
done to revive people's confidence in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Winston Wang,  son of business tycoon Wang Yung-ching and president of Grace
T.H.W. Group, was also present at the press conference. He urged both the ruling
and opposition parties to cooperate on pivotal issues involving the people's

      <P>A township head of Kaohsiung County, elected in December 2005, will be relieved
of his position after the Kaohsiung branch of the Taiwan High Court annulled his
election Wednesday on grounds of vote buying.</P>
      <P>Lin June-tsung, head of Niaosung township, said he deplores the court ruling on
the civil lawsuit but can only accept his fate as the ruling by the high court
is final.</P>
      <P>The township head assumed office March 1, 2006. The Kaohsiung District Court
found Lin guilty of vote buying in a criminal suit in June last year, but the
ruling was overturned by the high court in May this year.</P>
      <P>Lin, a member of the opposition Kuomintang, said he was puzzled as to which
court ruling he should comply with.</P>
      <P>In the civil suit, Lin contended that the 27 votes suspected of being bought by
his camp was immaterial to the electoral result, as he defeated his opponent,
Chen Wan-ting of the Democratic Progressive Party, by 3,034 votes.</P>
      <P>The high court, however, rejected that argument and ruled that his election was
invalid according to the Public Officials Election and Recall Law.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Civil Affairs of the Kaohsiung County government indicated that
Lin will be relieved of his position as soon as the county government receives
the court ruling, and that a by-election will take place within three months to
fill the vacancy.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Eliminating ambiguity in the United States' policy on cross-Taiwan Strait
relations would benefit trilateral relations between Taiwan, the U.S. and China,
and restoration of full diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Taiwan would
be the best way of achieving the objective, said an ex-U.S. official Thursday.</P>
      <P>Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, who is in the middle
of his first trip to Taiwan in seven years, reiterated in a press meeting that
U.S. recognition of Taiwan would bring stability and certainty,  and keep China
from misreading  the situation.</P>
      <P>U.S. President George Bush made a clear commitment that the U.S. would defend
Taiwan early in his first term before returning to an ambiguous stance on the
status of that commitment, which is "more dangerous" for U.S. national
interests, Bolton said.</P>
      <P>Bolton admitted, however, that the U.S. State Department will not support the
idea of restoring diplomatic relations with Taiwan as "the attitude of the
Formosa Problem has never left the State Department" since 1949, when the State
Department misjudged the situation in Taiwan, predicting that Taiwan's fall to
the Communists was inevitable and urging the Americans to leave the island.</P>
      <P>He said that he didn't understand how China has successfully portrayed Taiwan as
a troublemaker and Taiwan's U.N. referendum as provocative, given that Taiwan
poses neither a military nor economic threat to China.</P>
      <P>"But some people in the State Department are buying China's argument, " he said,
adding that the best time to change the situation will come at the beginning of
a new administration and pointing to the opportunity posed by next year's U.S.
presidential election.</P>
      <P>"I wish to hear someone [in the State Department] say that allowing people to
vote in the referendum is provocative, " Bolton said.</P>
      <P>The U.S. had been pressing Taiwan's government for over a decade to be
democratic, and the State Department is telling Taiwan "not to be so democratic"
at this moment, he said.</P>
      <P>Bolton also commented on other issues, including Taiwan's U.N. bid. He suggested
that Taiwan should focus on repealing U.N. Resolution 2758 as the objective is
to "go back to 1971", when former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N.  George H.W. Bush
proposed "dual representation."</P>
      <P>Addressing U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's mishandling of Taiwan's U.N.
membership application, Bolton said that Ban has made a huge mistake, which will
help Taiwan in some ways because it will generate interest in America and bring
attention to the case.</P>
      <P>He also expects that the U.S.  Congress "will react very negatively" to Ban
during the September session.</P>

federation decided Tuesday to cancel the tournament in Caracas, partly due to
Venezuela's refusal to grant visas to the Taiwanese team.</P>
      <P>Taiwan thereby had no chance to compete in the tournament despite four months of

three connecting roads were all flooded. The troupe began its work early Tuesday
morning when the floods started to recede.</P>
      <P>Officials said that waiting for authorization from the Ministry of National
Defense (MND) was largely responsible for the rescue delay.</P>
      <P>Meinung township head Lo Chien-to also explained  that he suggested the corps
delay rescue operations out of consideration for the safety of the troops and
the fact that rescue forces from the county's Fire Bureau had already proceeded
with their own relief work in flood areas.</P>
      <P>Yang said the current procedure for applying for military assistance in rescue
operations is "ridiculous" in terms of emergency response time. The current
procedure requires that local governments needing aid submit an application to
the Executive Yuan's disaster prevention and relief center.</P>
      <P>Yang claimed that military units in local areas should have the right to proceed
with disaster relief without authorization from the MND.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Eliminating ambiguity benefits all: ex-U.S. official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 15 (CNA)
08/16/07  11:37:35
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Eliminating ambiguity in the United States' policy on cross-Taiwan Strait
relations would benefit trilateral relations between Taiwan, the U.S. and China,
and restoration of full diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Taiwan would
be the best way of achieving the objective, said an ex-U.S. official Thursday.</P>
      <P>Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, who is in the middle
of his first trip to Taiwan in seven years, reiterated in a press meeting that
U.S. recognition of Taiwan would bring stability and certainty,  and keep China
from misreading  the situation.</P>
      <P>U.S. President George Bush made a clear commitment that the U.S. would defend
Taiwan early in his first term before returning to an ambiguous stance on the
status of that commitment, which is "more dangerous" for U.S. national
interests, Bolton said.</P>
      <P>Bolton admitted, however, that the U.S. State Department will not support the
idea of restoring diplomatic relations with Taiwan as "the attitude of the
Formosa Problem has never left the State Department" since 1949, when the State
Department misjudged the situation in Taiwan, predicting that Taiwan's fall to
the Communists was inevitable and urging the Americans to leave the island.</P>
      <P>He said that he didn't understand how China has successfully portrayed Taiwan as
a troublemaker and Taiwan's U.N. referendum as provocative, given that Taiwan
poses neither a military nor economic threat to China.</P>
      <P>"But some people in the State Department are buying China's argument, " he said,
adding that the best time to change the situation will come at the beginning of
a new administration and pointing to the opportunity posed by next year's U.S.
presidential election.</P>
      <P>"I wish to hear someone [in the State Department] say that allowing people to
vote in the referendum is provocative, " Bolton said.</P>
      <P>The U.S. had been pressing Taiwan's government for over a decade to be
democratic, and the State Department is telling Taiwan "not to be so democratic"
at this moment, he said.</P>
      <P>Bolton also commented on other issues, including Taiwan's U.N. bid. He suggested
that Taiwan should focus on repealing U.N. Resolution 2758 as the objective is
to "go back to 1971", when former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N.  George H.W. Bush
proposed "dual representation."</P>
      <P>Addressing U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's mishandling of Taiwan's U.N.
membership application, Bolton said that Ban has made a huge mistake, which will
help Taiwan in some ways because it will generate interest in America and bring
attention to the case.</P>
      <P>He also expects that the U.S.  Congress "will react very negatively" to Ban
during the September session.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has welcomed the International Baseball Federation's (IBAF's) decision to
cancel the 13th Youth Baseball Championships, which was supposed to open Aug. 17
in Venezuela, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang Chien-yeh said the federation's decision would send a message  to the world
that any country  playing  host to an international sporting event should not
mix sport and politics.</P>
      <P>He made the comments after an official of IBAF in Lausanne, Switzerland said the
federation decided Tuesday to cancel the tournament, partly due to Venezuela's
refusal to grant visas to the Taiwanese team.</P>
      <P>Taiwan thereby had no chance to compete in the tournament despite four months of
fruitless efforts to obtain entry visas to Venezuela.</P>
      <P>The IBAF official also cited the inappropriate preparation work of the host
country and the threat posed by rampant insurgents in neighboring Colombia,
which combined to make many states hesitant about sending teams to the
tournament.</P>

      <P>Commander of the Eighth Army Corps in southern Taiwan Chen Liang-chun offered an
explanation to Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing Wednesday for delays
affecting military rescue forces responding to a flood disaster in the county's
Meinung township Monday.</P>
      <P>The county suffered floods caused by heavy rains Monday, leaving many houses and
vehicles damaged. Several main roads were closed, and more than 100 people were
stranded in areas flooded that day.</P>
      <P>The county government's Water Resources Bureau officials pointed out that the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Representatives of a U.S.-based Taiwanese expatriate organization staged a
demonstration outside the Los Angeles residence of fugitive Rebar Asia Pacific
Group founder Wang You-theng Wednesday to urge him to return to Taiwan to face
criminal charges.</P>
      <P>Members of the Taiwanese Benevolent Association of America, led by president Lo
Su-o, made the move after their request to meet with Wang and his wife, Wang
Chin She-ying, was rejected.</P>
      <P>Not getting the opportunity to talk to the Wangs face-to-face, the members
displayed posters condemning the couple as "lacking morality and conscience" for
leaving behind huge debts in Taiwan and fleeing to the United States, and urging
the couple to return to Taiwan to face justice.</P>
      <P>Lo said her association had originally intended to politely try to persuade the
Wangs to return to Taiwan and had written to the couple to express their desire
to meet with them.</P>
      <P>However, the association was informed by Wang's lawyer Tuesday of Wang's
decision to turn down the request, Lo said.</P>
      <P>Lo said her association will continue following and watching the pair wherever
they go because "they have cheated the Taiwan people out of a lot of money."</P>
      <P>Wang was released on bail Aug. 7 from an immigration holding center in San
Pedro, Calif., where he had been held since Feb. 2 after trying to return to Los
Angeles with both his Republic of China and Dominican Republic passports
canceled, following a failed attempt to flee to Myanmar via Singapore.</P>
      <P>Wang is suspected of having embezzled billions of dollars in corporate funds
from the Rebar Group before fleeing with his wife to China late last year and
then to the United States in January this year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan authorities placed the couple on the country's most-wanted list Jan. 15
and have been seeking U.S. assistance to have them repatriated back to Taiwan to
face charges.</P>
      <P>In March, Taiwanese prosecutors indicted Wang and 106 others involved in the
Rebar Group scandal on a long list of charges, including fraud, money laundering
and insider trading. They are seeking a prison sentence of 30 years and an
unprecedented fine of NT$1.71 billion (US$52.13 million) for Wang.</P>

      <P>Fifteen of Taiwan's diplomatic allies have put forward a motion at the United
Nations pressing the world body to deal with Taiwan's membership application
according to established procedures, Taiwan officials posted in New York said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The motion, which the allies said they hope can be included on the agenda of the
upcoming annual gathering of the U.N. General Assembly, was submitted to the
General Assembly Tuesday by the ambassadors to the U.N. from The Gambia,
Swaziland and Tuvalu, three of the motion's sponsors. The other sponsors were
Belize, Burkina Faso, Honduras, Kiribati, Malawi, the Marshall Islands, Nauru,
Palau, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Sao Tome and
Principe, and the Solomon Islands.</P>
      <P>The 62nd regular session of the General Assembly is scheduled to open Sept. 18
at the United Nations Headquarters in New York. The General Committee is expect
to meet Sept. 19 to finalize the agenda of the session.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China has tried without success to re-enter the United Nations
since 1993. This year marks the first time it has changed tactics by bidding to
join the world body under the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian sent a membership application letter on behalf of
Taiwan to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon July 19, but the letter was
returned by Ban based on U.N. Resolution 2758, which U.N. officials said is the
basis of the "one China" policy of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>On July 31, Chen sent a second letter to Ban urging him to reconsider his
decision and one to Wang Guangya, China's permanent representative to the United
Nations,  who served as rotating president of the Security Council for July.
Both letters wer also returned.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has strongly protested Ban's move, claiming that only the Security
Council and the General Assembly have the authority to review and decide on
membership applications and that the U.N. Secretariat does not have the power to
decide on such matters.</P>
      <P>Also, Taiwan argued that Resolution 2758 neither grants China the right to
represent Taiwan at the United Nations nor states that Taiwan is either a part
of China or the People's Republic of China.</P>

recognizes Taiwan driver's licenses.</P>
      <P>Under the amendment, holders of Taiwan driver's licenses will be able to drive
on roads in Japan from Sept. 19, a Taiwan official stationed in Tokyo said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The goodwill measure adopted by the Japanese government follows its granting of
90-day visa-free treatment to Taiwan tourists in September 2005.</P>
      <P>According to the official, Taiwan's government will recognize Japanese driver's
licenses in the near future as a reciprocal gesture.</P>
      <P>Under the Japanese regulations, a translated certificate should be attached to
the driver's licenses.</P>
      <P>According to reports, travel service operators in the Japanese Prefecture of
Hokkaido had made great efforts to persuade the Japanese government to recognize
Taiwan driver's licenses as Taiwan is one of the main sources of foreign
tourists to the prefecture.</P>
      <P>According to official Japanese statistics, some 300,000 Taiwan tourists visit
Hokkaido annually. Taiwan tourists made a total of more than 1.3 million visits

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said Thursday that his city wants to seek the right to
host the 13th Youth World Baseball Championship (YWBC) after the entire
championship was canceled  because the Taiwan team was refused visas to enter
Venezuela, the host country.</P>
      <P>The Switzerland-based International Baseball Federation (IBAF) canceled the
Caracas tournament Tuesday after the host country succumbed to pressure from
China to refuse the visas for Taiwanese baseballers. The tournament was
originally scheduled to open Aug. 17.</P>
      <P>Hu pointed out that canceling an international game on the eve of its opening is
a serious matter and that such situation has never happened to the YWBC since
its first tournament held in Japan in 1989.</P>
      <P>The shambles in Venezuela reflects the universal principle that "politics should
not affect sports, " Hu said, expressing his appreciation for the IBAF's just
handling of the situation.</P>
      <P>Speaking about the central city's desire to host the 13th YWBC, which will be
postponed for 12 months while the IBAF finds another venue for the tournament,
Hu said Taichung is on the IBAF's priority list of possible YWBC host cities,
after his city hosted the IBAF Intercontinental Cup tournament last year.</P>
      <P>Besides Taichung, Japan and South Korea have both expressed their willingness to
host the international event.</P>
      <P>Hu said August is not a good month to hold the tournament in Taiwan because of
the hot weather and he suggested that the IBAF hold the competition in the
winter.</P>
      <P>The mayor also advised the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to grant visas to the
Venezuelan team should it be invited to attend games held in Taiwan, reiterating
his call for no political interference in sports.</P>

      <P>More than 65 percent of students responding to a recent survey have had
experience using pornography, with most first-time contacts with pornography
taking place between the ages of 13 and 15, officials of the Bureau of Health
Promotion said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted online by the Mercy Memorial Foundation for the bureau
from June 15-30 among 3,614 undergraduates and students studying in senior high
schools, junior high schools and senior years of elementary schools. The
respondents comprised 1,733 boys and 1,881 girls.</P>
      <P>According to the results of the survey, 15.3 percent of students in senior years
of elementary schools, 38 percent of junior high students, 69.3 percent of
senior high students and 79.4 percent of undergraduates admitted to having used
pornography.</P>
      <P>Fifty percent of junior high students, 51.9 percent of senior high students and
35 percent of undergraduates said they had their first contact with pornography
between the ages of 13 and 15.</P>
      <P>The figures compare with 27.8 percent of students in senior years of elementary
school, 16.4 percent of junior high students and 14.8 percent of senior high

MANILA, Philippines -- As the country's weather swung from one extreme to
another, pounding rains from Typhoon "Egay" (international codename: Sepat)
Wednesday turned Metro Manila streets into rivers, paralyzing a wide area of the
metropolis and bringing misery to millions. No less than President Gloria
Macapagal-Arroyo had a taste of what it was like to get stuck in floods and
traffic when her convoy was caught in one of the day's monstrous traffic jams,
forcing her to swing around so she could reach her appointments on Wednesday
morning.

    <HEADLINE>U.S.-Taiwan FTA long overdue: U.S. scholar</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Aug. 15 (CNA)
08/16/07  18:35:55
(By Jorge Liu and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Heritage Foundation scholar said Wednesday in a report that U.S. businesses
generally support the signing of a free trade agreement (FTA) between the United
States and Taiwan and that such an agreement is long overdue.</P>
      <P>For the benefit of the United States, the U.S. should sign an FTA with Taiwan
the sooner the better, John J. Tkacik, a senior research fellow in China, Taiwan
and Mongolia Policy in the Asian Studies Center of the Heritage Foundation wrote
in an article that was published on-line Wednesday titled Free Trade with Taiwan
is Long Overdue.</P>
      <P>A U.S.-Taiwan FTA has a lot to offer for everyone and promises to be more
beneficial to U.S. exports than to Taiwan's exports, Tkacik said, adding that a
U.S.-Taiwan FTA has the potential to boost American jobs in key manufacturing
industries, with autos and business equipment topping the list.</P>
      <P>U.S. manufacturers of other machinery and equipment, especially office
equipment, engines, turbines, communications equipment, appliances and an array
of industrial control computers would enjoy similar increases in exports if a
U.S.-Taiwan FTA were signed, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he went on, Taiwan is an important global power in its own right.
Taiwan is now the world's 16th-largest economy, the 10th-largest trading power
and the "third-largest holder of foreign exchange reserves after China and
Japan."</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan has a larger population than Australia and a larger gross
domestic product than any member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) . For the past two decades, he said, Taiwan has consistently ranked as
one of America's top 10 export markets and it already gives fairly free access
to imported U.S. goods and services, which totaled $23 billion in 2006.</P>
      <P>Among other things, a U.S.-Taiwan FTA would increase U.S. rice, poultry and
livestock exports and open a significant new market for new research medicines,
he added.</P>
      <P>American pharmaceutical companies would also gain, given Taiwan officials'
openness in discussing National Health Insurance (NHI) pharmaceutical
reimbursements, he continued.</P>
      <P>Tkacik said that automobiles, machinery and agriculture are some of the main
trade concerns on Capitol Hill and noted that annual U.S. exports in these
sectors would surge under an FTA with Taiwan. Furthermore, he said, Taiwan has a
developed economy on par with Europe, with labor and environmental standards
that are world-class and intellectual property protection that has earned the
praise of U.S. businesses.</P>
      <P>He said that while many members of the U.S. Congress oppose free trade
agreements and are reluctant to authorize full trade promotion authority, there
"should be room" for a broad bipartisan consensus on an FTA with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For its part, he said, Taiwan seems willing both to meet the high bar of the
U.S. Trade Representative's "gold standard" FTA template on trade and investment
issues and to address Congress's concern about labor and environmental issues.
Congress should seriously consider a country-specific mandate to begin FTA
negotiations with Taiwan along with instructions on how to structure the FTA.</P>
      <P>Beijing would, of course, complain about a U.S.-Taiwan FTA and would undoubtedly
say that a free trade agreement that must be approved by Congress is
qualitatively different from previous executive agreements, Tkacik admitted.</P>
      <P>But Washington could tell Beijing that it intends to "maintain cultural,
commercial and other unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan under the
stipulations of the Taiwan Relations Act," he said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he added, it is a diplomatic imperative that the United States not
allow China to dictate either the form or substance of U.S. trade relations with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The article was authored by Tkacik and Daniella Markheim, who is a Jay Van Andel
senior trade policy analyst at the Center for International Trade and Economics
at the Heritage Foundation.</P>

Taiwan, and moving northwesterly at 17-20 km/h toward the island and packing
maximum sustained winds of 191 km/h.</P>
      <P>Forecasters said Sepat poses a threat in waters southeast of Taiwan and the
Bashih Channel, and urged ships operating in these areas to take additional
precautions.</P>
      <P>The typhoon is forecast to hit Taiwan Friday afternoon, with the greatest impact
being seen Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to CWB data, Typhoon Sepat, a potentially destructive strong typhoon,
is moving toward Taiwan on a course similar to those of typhoons Tim in 1994,
and Bilis in 2000.</P>
      <P>Those two typhoons caused heavy human casualties and property damage in Taiwan,
the data shows. Due to Tim's devastation, 17 people died and other 70 were
injured as strong winds and torrential rains following Tim paralyzed road,
railway and air traffic in eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tim formed on the seas off eastern Luzon of the Philippines, July 10, then moved
northwesterly before striking Taiwan in the area of the mouth of the Siouguluan
River in Hualien, eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Bilis took shape Aug. 22 over the seas off of the eastern Philippines
before heading northwesterly toward Taiwan. After landing near Taitung,
southeastern Taiwan, it destroyed 434 houses and washed out many roads. Eleven
people died due to Bilis' devastation, which was attributed to agricultural
losses valued at NT$4.74 billion, the CWB data showed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's new U.N. bid ad calls for end to political apartheid</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan's exclusion from the United Nations over the past 36 years has been
likened to a form of political apartheid and should be brought to an end,
Government Information Office (GIO) Minister Shieh Jhy-wey said Thursday in a
press conference to announce Taiwan's U.N. bid advertisement for this year.</P>
      <P>Shieh unveiled a poster featuring the image of a hunch-backed figure in a fish
bowl, symbolic of Taiwan's limited international space, as well as the slogans
"A vital life should not be limited, a democratic nation not isolated" and "End
political apartheid."</P>
      <P>"To some extent, the U.N.'s exclusion of Taiwan is similar to South Africa's
ethnic separation from 1948 - 1994. It has been a form of political apartheid, "
said Shieh.</P>
      <P>The 36 years of exclusion from the U.N. have been unfair to Taiwan, which had
also suffered under 50 years of Japanese colonial rule and 38 years of martial
law under the Kuomintang (KMT), Shieh said.</P>
      <P>The GIO will start placing the advertisement in major U.S. newspapers and
magazines, such as the New York Times and Time Magazine, as well as newsstands
and bus stops in New York City from late August to promote Taiwan's brand new
U.N. bid this year, which for the first time will see the country apply for a
full U.N. membership under the name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Promotional films in various languages will also be aired in a number of
countries before the annual meeting of the U.N. General Assembly being held in
New York City in September, Shieh said.</P>
      <P>The promotion project is being conducted with a budget of a little more than
NT$10 million, he said.</P>
      <P>"U.N.'s exclusion of Taiwan is not in line with the global trend towards
democracy. U.N. Resolution 2758 was passed in 1971 against the background of a
Chinese civil war between two dictators -- Mao Zedong and Chiang Kai-shek -- but
it has continued to limit the international space of a democratic Taiwan for
almost three decades since, " Shieh said.</P>
      <P>"We know this [Taiwan's U.N. bid] is going to be difficult, but we have to do
it, " he said, also jokingly adding that the GIO renounced the copyrights of the
advertisements and everyone is welcome to reproduce and distribute them.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>No major twists in cross-Taiwan Strait ties will take place in the run-up to two
key elections in Taiwan, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Chen Ming-tong
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the comments in a seminar held jointly by the MAC and the semi-
official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) in Kaohsiung City, southern Taiwan to
explain the government's trade and economic policy toward China and explore
public opinions in this regard.</P>
      <P>Stating that the government will maintain its current policy toward China based
on the "Taiwan-centric" notion of seeking economic benefits while safeguarding
national security and sovereignty, Chen gave assurances that "drastic surprises"
in Taiwan-China links are unlikely prior to next year's Jan. 12 legislative
election and March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>As the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has been soliciting public
endorsement to hold a referendum on Taiwan's U.N. bid alongside the presidential
poll, many people are concerned whether cross-strait ties would be affected by
this matter, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, Chen promised that the government is poised to maintain its present
China policy to keep peace in the strait and allow Taiwanese companies to
continue expanding.</P>
      <P>The government fully realizes that cross-strait relations are critical to
Taiwan's development and are of a great importance to the continued growth of
Taiwan's businesses, he said, repeating that the government will seek to improve
bilateral ties, manage a stable relationship between the two sides and build
peace in the region.</P>
      <P>Citing government statistics, Chen reported that cross-strait trade totaled over
US$88.1 billion last year, while Taiwan's people made more than 4.4 million
visits to China during the same year -- figures indicating that cross-strait
economic and trade activities form an extremely essential part of Taiwan's
economic expansion.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, SEF Chairman Hung Chi-chang said that now is the
time that China-based Taiwan businessmen consider shifting their operations to
Taiwan in view of rising production costs in China.</P>
      <P>The government and the SEF are more than willing to help Taiwan businessmen
hoping to operate in the home market, he added.</P>

      <P>Former Vice Premier Yeh Chu-lan, who was previously reported as being favored by
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank Hsieh to
join him on DPP's presidential ticket, confirmed Thursday that she has accepted
Hsieh's invitation to be his top campaign manager.</P>
      <P>Yeh, a woman who is devotedly supported by many of the country's Hakka people,
said that she will do her utmost to drum up support for Hsieh and his running
mate -- former Premier Su Tseng-chang, Hsieh's presidential primary rival who
nodded his agreement only a day earlier to be Hsieh's running mate -- as the
ticket's top campaign officer until the DPP finally wins the 2008 race.</P>
      <P>Yeh also appealed to her Hakka supporters for their understanding that she is
not teaming up with Hsieh as they previously anticipated and urged them to
support the Hsieh-Su ticket.</P>
      <P>She said she would be grateful if the Hakka supporters throw their staunch
support behind her so they can jointly stump for the Hsieh-Su ticket and keep
the DPP in office for another term.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, also formerly a premier, announced Wednesday that former Premier Su will
serve as his running mate in the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>A Hsieh-Su ticket is generally considered to have a better chance at winning the

    <TEXT>
      <P>In response to next week's planned demonstration by pig farmers in Taipei
against a government plan to allow the use of a veterinary drug, Executive Yuan
spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey said Thursday that the government will fully take
farmers' opinions into account before lifting the ban.</P>
      <P>According to Shieh, the government has heard the voices of hog farmers  and the
Council of Agriculture  (COA)  will step up communications  with them to ensure
that they gain a better understanding of a safe use of the animal drug which
promotes the growth of lean meat in livestock.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) decided to lift the ban on
ractopamine by the end of this month at the earliest, after having studied the
drug's use in the United States and Japan, Shieh said.</P>
      <P>The DOH is set to permit regulated amounts of ractopamine residues in different
organs of pigs and cattle and their meat after Aug. 21 if no one voices
opposition, he said, and denied that the decision was made due to strong
pressure exerted by the United States, he said.</P>
      <P>Later the same day, the Consumers' Foundation issued a statement expressing its
objections to the government's plan to legalize the use of the banned drug.</P>
      <P>The foundation urged the DOH and COA not to give way to foreign pressure and
allow the drug use, which they say will pose great risks to consumers' health,
especially to patients with liver and heart problems.</P>
      <P>Over 10,000 people from across Taiwan are set to demonstrate next Tuesday in
front of relevant agencies and the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) against a
government decision to lift the ban on ractopamine due to pressure from the
United States, a representative from the local pig-raising industry said the
same day.</P>
      <P>Wang Feng-ming, chairman of the Republic of China hog-raising association, said
that in addition to some 7,000 pig farmers from central and southern region,
thousands of consumers and environmental protection and female rights activists
will also take part in the demonstration in front of the DOH.</P>
      <P>From the DOH, demonstrators will proceed to the AIT and the Council of
Agriculture (COA) , where they will also stage protests against the easing of
the ban, Wang said, adding that pig farmers are prepared to stage a series of
demonstrations over the long term if the government fails to repeal its ban
decision by Aug. 21.</P>
      <P>Despite repeated assurances, the DOH and COA announced Tuesday that they will
lift the ban on ractopamine and denied allegations that the decision was made as
a result of U.S. concerns after two shipments of U.S. pork imports were found to
contain the unlawful substance.</P>
      <P>Wang accused the government of turning a blind eye to local hog producers'
livelihoods and consumers' health concern, questioning the meaning of the
government's efforts over the past decade in guiding farmers not to use the
drug, which promotes the growth of lean meat in livestock.</P>
      <P>Earlier the same day, Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) lawmaker Yin Ling-ying
demanded the government give a reasonable explanation of its lifting of the ban
on ractopamine and asked relevant agency chiefs to resign from their posts to
assume responsibility for what she called a mistaken policy.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference held in Yunlin county in southern Taiwan that was
also attended by representatives from the local pig- raising association, Yin
urged the DOH and the COA to provide the public with a sensible explanation of
their decision to allow the use of ractopamine.</P>
      <P>Yin also urged relevant DOH and COA officials to step down from their posts and
assume responsibility.</P>
      <P>The two agencies announced Tuesday that they would lift the ban on the animal
drug which was banned by the COA last year.</P>
      <P>Although  government  officials  said that limited  use of ractopamine is lawful
in 24 countries, including the United States and Japan, she asked why they did
not also point out that the animal drug is banned in more than 160 other
countries.</P>
      <P>She threatened to take pig farmers to the streets if the government fails to
respond to their calls.</P>

      <P>The quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) will help Taiwanese
business people operating in China, known locally as "taishang, " to solve
problems that arise in the course of business operations, SEF Chairman Hong Chi-
chang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hong made the remarks at a seminar held in Taiwan's southern port city of
Kaohsiung, which was attended by 230 Taiwanese business persons operating in
China.</P>
      <P>Hong said taishang previously sought investment opportunities in China owing to
its low labor costs, lax regulations on labor affairs and environmental
protection, and easy acquisition of land to set up manufacturing plants.</P>
      <P>However, he said that the situation is changing, and that now the situation is
characterized by insufficient labor and higher wage demands in southern and
eastern areas of China. Taiwanese business people in China have thus come to a
fork in the road and have to decide whether to move their businesses to China's
mid-west, to Vietnam, which is further south than China, or return to Taiwan,
Hong said.</P>
      <P>Noting that taishang are Taiwan's invisible assets as they represent an
extension of the economic influence of domestic business and national power of
Taiwan to China, Hong said the SEF has made efforts to integrate domestic
resources and provide useful information and assistance to help them deal with
business difficulties.</P>
      <P>The government will also make greater efforts to improve Taiwan' sinvestment
environment in order to ensure Taiwan's economic prosperity, Hong went on.</P>
      <P>Chairman  of the Cabinet's  Mainland  Affairs Council Chen Ming-tong, also, said
at the seminar that Taiwan's trade and economic policies aim to strike a balance
between cross-Taiwan Strait business development and global market expansion. He
added that the government is working on industrial upgrades and transformation
to seek a better future for the nation.</P>
      <P>Chen encouraged Taiwanese business people in China to return to home and invest
here after making a profit in China.</P>
      <P>SEF Vice Chairman and Secretary-General You Ying-lung said the SEF has
positioned itself as a well-intentioned, humanistic, attentive organization,
keen to provide aid to Taiwanese business people operating in China as
difficulties in cross-Taiwan Strait interactions remain.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese have little to worry about their national economy and Taiwan-U.S.
bilateral trade is on track for another record year, American Institute in
Taiwan (AIT) Taipei Office Director Stephen Young said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Young took note of the food safety issue, and encouraged Taiwan to "review
accepted international standards and adopt a science-based approach that ensures
consumer safety while avoiding unnecessary trade disruptions, " in his remarks
at a Leader Forum organized by the Taipei-based Chinese National Federation of
Industries (CNFI).</P>
      <P>Young's elaboration on the issue came on the heels of the Department of Health's
(DOH's) announcement Tuesday that it would relax a ban on ractopamine in
livestock to permit low residue levels of the veterinary drug in pigs and
cattle. The issue has received much public attention since the DOH rejected last
month two shipments of U.S.-exported pork which were found to contain
ractopamine residue.</P>
      <P>In the first half of the year, a 19 percent increase in U.S. exports to Taiwan
outpaced overall bilateral trade growth at 7 percent,  Young  said,  noting
that the U.S.-Taiwan  economic relationship has never been stronger.</P>
      <P>"Many of my Taiwanese friends seem preoccupied by doubts over Taiwan's economic
competitiveness and future.  Given your many strengths, I think you have little
reason for worry, " he told CNFI members.</P>
      <P>The AIT also noted that economic issues were emerging as a major topic of the
coming presidential election and welcomed that debate, he said.</P>
      <P>Young said that the U.S.-Taiwan Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA)
is the primary vehicle for deepening bilateral trade relationship and the
process has seen renewed vigor, most recently with July's successful round of
talks in Washington.</P>
      <P>The top U.S. representative in Taiwan also once again urged Taiwan to expand
economic ties across the Taiwan Strait to enhance its global competitiveness.</P>

      <P>Legislative Yuan Deputy Speaker Chung Jung-chi, a member of the opposition
People First Party (PFP) , is likely to be named as the new vice president of
the Control Yuan, a legislative source said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The high-level source, who preferred anonymity, further said the PFP could
recommend three candidates for the Control Yuan seats in proportion to the
number of its seats in the legislature.</P>
      <P>According to the source, the PFP previously recommended two of its incumbent
legislators for Control Yuan seats -- Feng Ting-kuo and Liu Wen-hsiung.</P>
      <P>The source said he had passed on to PFP Chairman James Soong a message about
President Chen Shui-bian's plan to refer a new list of Control Yuan nominations
to the legislature for approval. Soong clearly told the source that the PFP,
which controls 21 seats in the legislature, will absolutely not send any
recommendation list to the president with regard to the Control Yuan nomination.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Feng Ting-kuo said he is not aware of any information about the
Control Yuan nomination, stressing that he is busy with his bid for re-election
in the Taichung County's third constituency in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Anonymous PFP sources said as Hakka people command a strong influence in the
PFP, the PFP could face strong pressure if it chooses to boycott President
Chen's new nomination list and Chung, a Hakka bigwig, is indeed nominated to be
the next Control Yuan vice president.</P>
      <P>A Presidential Office spokesman said earlier in the day that if the opposition-
controlled legislature is willing to deal with the Control Yuan nomination issue
during its new session, scheduled to open next month, President Chen will refer
a new list for lawmakers to screen.</P>
      <P>The country's supreme watchdog body has remain moribund since the tenure of the
previous Control Yuan members expired Jan. 31, 2005 due to a boycott by the PFP
and its "pan-blue" ally -- the main opposition Kuomintang.  The "pan-blues"
declined to review the president-proposed nomination list because they felt some
of the nominees failed to live up to public expectations.</P>
      <P>The issue was again spotlighted after the Council of Grand Justices (CGJ) ruled

    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of the Commission on the Disciplinary Sanctions of Functionaries (CDSF)
has been tapped to be the new Judicial Yuan chief, a senior legislative source
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the source, President Chen Shui-bian is set to nominate CDSF Chief
Commissioner Yang Jen-shou to replace Weng Yueh-sheng as new Judicial Yuan
president. Weng's tenure will expire in September.</P>
      <P>The source, who preferred anonymity, further said Chen will name an incumbent
grand justice to serve as Judicial Yuan vice president.</P>
      <P>As to the Control Yuan lineup, the source said, Chen will nominate an
independent acceptable to the opposition "pan-blue" alliance to serve as the new
Control Yuan president. The source further said incumbent Legislative Yuan
Deputy Speaker Chung Jung-chi, amember of the opposition People First Party
(PFP) , will be named as the new Control Yuan deputy chief.</P>
      <P>The country's supreme watchdog body has remain moribund since the tenure of the
previous Control Yuan members expired Jan. 31, 2005 due to a boycott by the PFP
and its "pan-blue" ally -- the main opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blues"  declined  to review the president-proposed nomination list
because they felt some of the nominees failed to live up to public expectations.</P>
      <P>The issue was again spotlighted after the Council of Grand Justices ruled
Wednesday that the legislature's refusal to review the list is unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>According to the Legislative Yuan source, the KMT and the PFP are not likely to
recommend lists of Control Yuan candidates as requested by the president.
Nevertheless, the source said, President Chen will respect opposition opinions
in drawing up a new list. For instance, those on an unpublicized KMT-drafted
recommendation list, such as Wang Hsin-ching, better known by his pen name Nan
Fang-shou, will be high on the Chen-proposed list.</P>
      <P>The president will also refer to the leslature soon a list of nominations for
Judicial Yuan president and vice president as well as eight seats on the Council
of Grand Justices for approval.</P>
      <P>Among the 15 seats on the Council of Grand Justices for which President Chen
nominated candidates in 2003, eight of them, including the post of president and
vice president of the Judicial Yuan, are for four-year terms, while the
remainder are for eight-year terms. However, as former Judicial Yuan Vice
President Cheng Chung-mo resigned and Yang Jen-shou left to serve as the head of
the Commission on the Disciplinary Sanctions of Functionaries, there are
currently only 13 grand justices.</P>
      <P>Judicial Yuan President Weng Yueh-sheng, who concurrently serves as a grand
justice, as well as five other grand justices, namely Lin Yung-mo, Wang He-
hsiung, Yu Hsueh-ming, Tseng You-tien and Liao Yi-nan, will see their terms
expire this September.</P>
      <P>This is why the president has to put forward a list of eight grand justice
nominees to fill the vacancies.</P>
      <P>Other incumbent grand justices, including Lai, Hsu Pi-hu, Peng Feng-chih, Lin
Tze-yi, Hsu Tsung-li, Hsieh Tsai-chuan and Hsu Yu-hsiu, will see their terms
expire in September 2011.</P>

      <P>Typhoon Sepat drew closer to waters off Taiwan's southeastern coast late
Thursday, with the northeastern county of Yilan falling into the land warning
areas, meteorologists with the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) said.</P>
      <P>After releasing a sea warning earlier in the day, the bureau issued a land
warning at 8: 30 p.m. Thursday for Sepat, the eighth tropic storm reported in
the West Pacific area this year.</P>
      <P>The land warning areas cover the eastern counties of Hualien and Taitung, Yilan
in northeastern Taiwan as well as Green Island, Orchid Island and the Hengchun
Peninsula on the southernmost tip of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If Sepat, which means freshwater fish in Malay, maintains its current course,
CWB forecasters said all areas of Taiwan must be on guard against the storm.</P>
      <P>The typhoon was centered 580 km southeast of Taitung in eastern Taiwan at 11: 30
p.m. It was moving northwesterly toward Taiwan at 20 kph and packing maximum
sustained winds of 191 kph.</P>
      <P>Weathermen said Sepat poses a threat in waters southeast and northeast of Taiwan
and the Bashih Channel, and urged ships operating in these areas to take
additional precautions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Little to worry about in Taiwan's economy: AIT Taipei Office head</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese have little to worry about their national economy and Taiwan-U.S.
bilateral trade is on track for another record year, American Institute in
Taiwan (AIT) Taipei Office Director Stephen Young said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Young took note of the food safety issue, and encouraged Taiwan to "review
accepted international standards and adopt a science-based approach that ensures
consumer safety while avoiding unnecessary trade disruptions, " in his remarks
at a Leader Forum organized by the Taipei-based Chinese National Federation of
Industries (CNFI).</P>
      <P>Young's elaboration on the issue came on the heels of the Department of Health's
(DOH's) announcement Tuesday that it would relax a ban on ractopamine in
livestock to permit low residue levels of the veterinary drug in pigs and
cattle. The issue has received much public attention since the DOH rejected last
month two shipments of U.S.-exported pork which were found to contain
ractopamine residue.</P>
      <P>In the first half of the year, a 19 percent increase in U.S. exports to Taiwan
outpaced overall bilateral trade growth at 7 percent,  Young  said,  noting
that the U.S.-Taiwan  economic relationship has never been stronger.</P>
      <P>"Many of my Taiwanese friends seem preoccupied by doubts over Taiwan's economic
competitiveness and future.  Given your many strengths, I think you have little
reason for worry, " he told CNFI members.</P>
      <P>The AIT also noted that economic issues were emerging as a major topic of the
coming presidential election and welcomed that debate, he said.</P>
      <P>Young said that the U.S.-Taiwan Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA)
is the primary vehicle for deepening bilateral trade relationship and the
process has seen renewed vigor, most recently with July's successful round of
talks in Washington.</P>
      <P>The top U.S. representative in Taiwan also once again urged Taiwan to expand
economic ties across the Taiwan Strait to enhance its global competitiveness.</P>

      <P>Legislative Yuan Deputy Speaker Chung Jung-chi, a member of the opposition
People First Party (PFP) , is likely to be named as the new vice president of
the Control Yuan, a legislative source said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The high-level source, who preferred anonymity, further said the PFP could
recommend three candidates for the Control Yuan seats in proportion to the
number of its seats in the legislature.</P>
      <P>According to the source, the PFP previously recommended two of its incumbent
legislators for Control Yuan seats -- Feng Ting-kuo and Liu Wen-hsiung.</P>
      <P>The source said he had passed on to PFP Chairman James Soong a message about
President Chen Shui-bian's plan to refer a new list of Control Yuan nominations
to the legislature for approval. Soong clearly told the source that the PFP,
which controls 21 seats in the legislature, will absolutely not send any
recommendation list to the president with regard to the Control Yuan nomination.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Feng Ting-kuo said he is not aware of any information about the
Control Yuan nomination, stressing that he is busy with his bid for re-election
in the Taichung County's third constituency in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Anonymous PFP sources said as Hakka people command a strong influence in the
PFP, the PFP could face strong pressure if it chooses to boycott President
Chen's new nomination list and Chung, a Hakka bigwig, is indeed nominated to be
the next Control Yuan vice president.</P>
      <P>A Presidential Office spokesman said earlier in the day that if the opposition-
controlled legislature is willing to deal with the Control Yuan nomination issue
during its new session, scheduled to open next month, President Chen will refer
a new list for lawmakers to screen.</P>
      <P>The country's supreme watchdog body has remain moribund since the tenure of the
previous Control Yuan members expired Jan. 31, 2005 due to a boycott by the PFP
and its "pan-blue" ally -- the main opposition Kuomintang.  The "pan-blues"

      <P>Taiwan is bracing for the largest storm to hit so far this year, as Typhoon
Sepat, for which the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) issued a land warning at 8: 30
p.m. Thursday, continues to approach Taiwan Friday.</P>
      <P>CWB meteorologists forecast that Sepat will begin to pound Taiwan with strong
winds and torrential rain from Friday afternoon and that its onslaught is
expected to cover the entire island with a radius of 250 km.</P>
      <P>The typhoon was centered 390 km southeast of Taitung in eastern Taiwan as of 9
a.m., moving northwesterly at 18-21 kph toward the island and packing maximum
sustained winds of 184 kph.</P>
      <P>CWB chief meteorologist Lu Kuo-chen said strong winds and heavy rains are
expected to begin to hit Taiwan later Friday, with the typhoon's influence on
the island expected to peak between Friday night and Saturday morning.</P>
      <P>Flash floods are expected to pound eastern and southern Taiwan again throughout
Saturday and Sunday in the wake of two tropical storms -- Pabuk and Wutip --
which swept across Taiwan last week and caused landslides and flash floods in
those areas, Lu said.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian is set to refer a list of nominations for the Judicial
Yuan presidency and vice presidency as well as eight seats on the Council of
Grand Justices (CGJ) to the Legislative Yuan Friday for approval, according to
Presidential Office sources.</P>
      <P>Besides nominating Yang Jen-shou, chief commissioner of the Commission on the
Disciplinary Sanctions of Functionaries (CDSF) as the new Judicial Yuan
president, Chen has nominated Hsieh Tsai-chuan, a senior grand justice, as
Yang's deputy, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Yang will replace Weng Yueh-sheng, whose tenure is set to expire at the end of
September, while Hsieh will fill the post left vacant by Cheng Chung-mo, who
resigned in April 2006 amid allegations that he had lodged in a motel with a
young woman.</P>
      <P>Yang, 65, graduated from the Department of Law of National Taiwan University
(NTU) . He has a master's degree from Chinese Culture University on
Yangmingshan. Yang has worked his way up the judicial ladder. He has been the

president as well as Judicial Yuan secretary-general.</P>
      <P>He served as a grand justice between 2003 and 2006 and was then transferred to
his current post as the chief commissioner of the body responsible for handing
down disciplinary  measures for public functionaries found to be derelict in
their duty.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, 63, is also a graduate of the NTU's Department of Law and has a master's
degree in law from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. He has served

      <P>Hundreds of locations at risk of mudslides have been marked around the country
in preparation for Typhoon Sepat, which is beginning to sweep across Taiwan,
officials from the Soil and Water Conservation Bureau under the Council of
Agriculture announced Friday.</P>
      <P>The bureau issued "yellow alert" Friday against potential rock and mudslides in
742 areas demarcated in 67 rural townships and 302 villages and boroughs in
eight counties around the island.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials urged the public to be on high alert against the possibility of
rock and mudslides, and to prepare for evacuation as Typhoon Sepat is expected
to bring torrential rains to the entire island, particularly eastern and
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 742 potentially risky areas are scattered throughout the eastern counties of
Yilan, Hualien and Taitung, the central Nantou County and the southern counties
of Tainan, Kaohsiung and Pingtung.</P>
      <P>Officials warned that mountainous  areas are now extremely vulnerable to
landslides because the soil in these areas is water saturated in the wake of the
two tropical storms -- Pabuk and Wutip -- which swept across southern Taiwan
last week.</P>
      <P>They said that a "red alert" will be issued in these areas if landslides or
mudslides indeed occur. Evacuation procedures will be implemented immediately
upon the issuance of a "red alert, " they added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) vice presidential candidate,
Su Tseng-chang, departed New York for home late Thursday.</P>
      <P>Su, who stepped down from the premiership shortly after losing the DPP
presidential primary to Frank Hsieh in May, agreed to serve as Hsieh's running
mate just a day before the Aug. 15 deadline set by Hsieh for announcing his
running mate.</P>
      <P>Su kept a low profile since arriving in the United States in late July for a
private visit in the company of his wife and two daughters. He first visited Los
Angeles and later traveled to Philadelphia and other cities on the U.S East
Coast.</P>
      <P>The DPP chapter on the U.S. East Coast and major Taiwanese expatriate
associations in the greater New York area organized groups to see Su and his
wife off, the sources said, adding that the couple are scheduled to arrive at
Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport Saturday morning.</P>
      <P>Despite differences in their personal styles, Hsieh and Su have many things in
common. Both have served as lawyers, lawmakers and DPP chairmen. Both worked as
defense lawyers in court cases concerning the Kaohsiung Incident, also known as
the Formosa Incident, which is recognized as a watershed event in Taiwan's
recent transition to democracy.</P>
      <P>Hsieh had been mayor of Kaohsiung, Taiwan's second largest city, before serving
as premier between 2005 and early 2006. Su had been magistrate of the
southernmost county of Pingtung and the country's most populous county of Taipei
before succeeding Hsieh as premier on Jan. 25, 2006. He served as premier until
May of this year.</P>
      <P>Hsieh and Su used to belong to the now defunct Welfare State faction within the
DPP, but their relationship underwent a severe test during the bitterly
contested DPP presidential primary.</P>
      <P>While announcing Su's assent to his invitation to team up for the 2008 election,
Hsieh said that although there had been conflict within the DPP during the
presidential primary, the party is now cooperating smoothly.</P>
      <P>Noting that he advocates reform as well as reconciliation and co-existence,
Hsieh said the promotion of co-existence should start within the DPP ranks.</P>
      <P>"After I win the presidential election, I will also cooperate with main
opposition Kuomintang presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou to safeguard Taiwan, "
Hsieh said, adding that he is convinced that it is impossible  for Taiwan  to
make  breakthroughs  in the international arena without solidarity at home.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian is set to name former Vice Premier Yeh Chu-lan as his
chief of staff, Presidential Office sources said Friday.</P>
      <P>If the president does name Yeh to the post, she will become the first woman ever
to serve as Presidential Office secretary-general.</P>
      <P>The post has been left vacant for nearly three months since Tan Sun  Chen  was
transferred  from  the position  to serve  as secretary-general  of  the
National  Security  Council  in an administration  reshuffle  that followed  the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) May 6 presidential primary.</P>
      <P>Yeh, a Hakka politician who was previously reported as being favored by the
DPP's presidential candidate, Frank Hsieh, to serve as his running mate for the
2008 election, just confirmed Thursday that she has accepted Hsieh's invitation
to be his top campaign manager.</P>
      <P>It remains unclear whether Yeh will continue her leading role in the Hsieh
campaign after taking up the Presidential Office post.</P>
      <P>While announcing his decision earlier this week to team up with former Premier
Su Tseng-chang, Hsieh also expressed his gratitude for Yeh, praising her
selflessness and loyalty to the DPP during his search for a running mate.</P>
      <P>Hsieh further said he will entrust her with an important position so as to live
up to the expectations of the Hakka supporters. Hakkas form the second largest
ethnic group in Taiwan, after Holo Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>During a campaign trip to the northern county of Taoyuan Thursday, Hsieh said
Yeh will help him and his running mate Su draw up their campaign platform and
spearhead efforts to woo votes from women and Hakka people.</P>
      <P>"Yeh has promised not to be absent from the election, " Hsieh said, adding that
the formation of the Hsieh-Su-Yeh golden triangle will unite to fight for final
victory in the 2008 election.</P>
      <P>For her part, Yeh said she will pull out all the stops to stump for the Hsieh-Su
ticket. "The DPP must win for the sake of Taiwan, and I believe that the Hakka
people will stand by my side, " she added.</P>
      <P>Even though some Hakka groups have expressed disappointment at her failure to
make it onto the DPP presidential ticket, Yeh said her support for Hsieh will
not waiver.</P>
      <P>Yeh, who entered politics after her husband, a dissident during Taiwan's
infamous martial law era, chose to commit suicide rather than be arrested in
1989 over freedom of press issues, has held many important  posts,  including
minister  of  transportation  and communications and head of the Council for
Hakka Affairs. She also once served as lawmaker and acting mayor of Kaohsiung,
Taiwan's second largest city.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government did not receive any pressure from the United States to lift its
ban on the veterinary drug ractopamine ahead of its decision to relax the ban, a
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Friday.</P>
      <P>MOFA deputy spokeswoman Yeh Fei-pi said that the government decided to relax the
ban to permit low levels of ractopamine residue in pigs and cattle after
conducting a thorough assessment of the impact of the drug on public health and
food safety.</P>
      <P>Yeh denied allegations that the Department of Health (DOH) made the decision,
which was announced Aug. 14, due to pressure from the United States.</P>
      <P>The relaxing of the ban also has nothing to do with President Chen Shui-bian's
upcoming transit stop on U.S. soil as alleged by some media outlets, Yeh
reiterated.</P>
      <P>According to a proposed revision to the DOH's standards for veterinary drug
residues, the maximum allowable level of ractopamine residue in pigs and cattle
would be 10 ppb in muscle and fat tissue, 40 ppb in the liver, and 90 ppb in the
kidneys.</P>
      <P>If the proposal meets no objection by Aug. 21, the new standards can be
implemented at the end of the month at the earliest, DOH officials said.</P>
      <P>Ractopamine,  marketed under the brand name Paylean, is a phenolethanolamine
s-adrenoceptor agonist that is used for the improvement of weight gain, carcass
leanness and feed efficiency in animals, DOH officials noted.</P>
      <P>Studies have shown that the drug can be processed rapidly by animals and humans
and that the chances of long-term consumption of residue of the drug in meat
having toxicological effects are extremely slim, they said.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine under the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture decided last October to ban all drugs used
by farmers as food additives to boost the growth of lean meat in pigs, including
ractopamine, after cases were reported abroad concerning the effect of such
drugs on consumers' cardiac and neural systems.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will put forth a proposal during the upcoming Asian Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum meeting to make known the country's efforts to tackle
global warming and climate change issues, the head of Taiwan's Environmental
Protection Administration (EPA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>EPA Minister Chen Chung-hsin said that under the proposal, Taiwan will make
efforts to address global warming and climate change issues in five areas,
namely environmental  protection  in industry; consumption patterns; clean
production;  pollution control; and greenhouse gas reduction.</P>
      <P>During the next APEC meeting, slated for Sept. 8-9 in Sydney, Australia, Taiwan
delegates will inform the APEC member countries that Taiwan is able to make a
solid contribution to efforts to control greenhouse gas emissions, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen, who had recently attended an international meeting on environmental
protection in Hawaii, arrived in Washington, D.C. earlier this week for a short
visit. He met with several officials in charge  of environmental  protection
affairs  from  the  Bush administration Thursday morning for talks on Taiwan's
environmental protection policy and current situation.</P>
      <P>The EPA head then delivered a speech at the Woodrow Wilson International Center
for Scholars think tank in the afternoon. He briefed his audience on Taiwan's
efforts in pushing for legislation of a greenhouse gas reduction act and
recapped the EPA's efforts to protect water resources, promote garbage
separation and push for waste recycling.</P>
      <P>He said that in the face of global warming and climate change, Taiwan proposes
that a World Environment Organization be formed.</P>
      <P>He condemned China for its senseless obstruction of Taiwan's participation  in
global environmental  protection meetings and activities.</P>
      <P>The EPA head also said that excessive mercury pollution created by Chinese
industries has already affected the quality of air and the environment in East
Asia.</P>
      <P>In response to a question on whether Taiwan will build new nuclear power plants
in an effort to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Chen said that the
government is determined to provide the Taiwan people with a "nuclear-free"
environment.</P>
      <P>He further said that the government  should restrict  the operations of thermal
power plants, which use coal as fuel, and invest more in developing
environmentally-friendly hydraulic and wind power plants.</P>

      <P>The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) has activated a natural disaster response
mechanism in a drive to prevent possible profiteering in countrywide vegetable
and fruit markets amid the approach of Typhoon Sepat -- the largest storm to hit
so far this year, a spokesman for the FTC said Friday.</P>
      <P>Under the emergency response mechanism, price fluctuations in terms of
agricultural products will be closely monitored, the spokesman said, reiterating
that violators against the Fair Trade Law will face severe punishment.</P>
      <P>According to the FTC, data released by agricultural product trading centers
around the country showed that the average wholesale price of vegetables was
NT$25.5 per kg Friday, while that of fruits was NT$21.9 per kg.</P>
      <P>To prevent vegetable price hikes as a result of anticipated losses, the FTC has
asked for the cooperation of the Council of Agriculture in asking farmers'
groups to boost supplies to major wholesale markets around the country, FTC
officials said.</P>

      <P>Railway transportation service will be partially suspended beginning late Friday
and all domestic flights will be grounded Saturday, given the approach of
Typhoon Sepat -- the largest storm to hit Taiwan so far this year.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) announced earlier that on the Western
Line, express trains from Pingtung in southern Taiwan to Sijhih of Taipei County
in the north will all be suspended from 10:50 p.m., with those from Chidu in
Keelung, northern Taiwan, to Pingtung to be suspended from 10:22 p.m.</P>
      <P>On the Yilan and North Link Lines in the east, all trains setting off from
Hualien toward Shulin in Taipei County will be suspended from 8:30 p.m, while
those from Shulin to Hualien will stop operating at 7:48 p.m.</P>
      <P>On the Hualien-Taitung Line, all trains running from Taitung to Hualien will be
suspended from 7:30 p.m. while trains from Hualien to Kaohsiung are to be
suspended at 7:11 p.m.</P>
      <P>On the South Link Line, all trains from Taitung to Kaohsiung will be suspended
from 7: 10 p.m. while those from Kaohsiung to Taitung to be suspended beginning
at 6:50 p.m.</P>
      <P>The TRA will make public Saturday's schedule at 9: 30 p.m., a spokesman for the
administration.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Saturday's domestic flights have all been canceled as the island on
the alert for a potentially devastating typhoon, while several international
flights taking off tomorrow for regional cities like Ho Chi Minh City and Macao
have also been canceled.</P>
      <P>Travelers are recommended to check their flight information before heading to
the airport Saturday.</P>
      <P>As to the Kinmen-Xiamen ferry line, Kinmen officials responsible for port
affairs said the transportation link between Kinmen to Xiamen and Chuanchou in
southeastern China has been closed since 1:30 p.m., and the closure will
continue throughout Saturday.</P>
      <P>Central Weather Bureau (CWB) meteorologists forecast that Sepat will begin to
pound Taiwan with strong winds and torrential rains Friday afternoon. The
onslaught is expected to cover the entire island as the storm has a radius of
250 km.</P>
      <P>As of 4: 00 p.m., the CWB reported that the typhoon was centered 270 km
southeast of Taitung, moving northwesterly at 18-21 km/h toward the island and
packing maximum sustained winds of 184 km/h.</P>
      <P>CWB chief meteorologist Lu Kuo-chen said strong winds and heavy rains are
expected to begin to hit Taiwan later Friday, and that the typhoon's influence
on the island is expected to peak between Friday night and Saturday morning.</P>
      <P>Flash floods are expected in eastern and southern Taiwan again throughout
Saturday and Sunday given soil saturation in the wake of two tropical storms --
Pabuk and Wutip -- which swept across Taiwan last week causing landslides and
flash floods in those same areas, Lu said.</P>

      <P>Officials of the Central Emergency Operation Center organized by National Fire

      <P>The center has listed several places around the country as potentially dangerous
areas due to the threats posed by the typhoon, including 292 rivers, 131
mountainous areas and 66 coastal areas.</P>
      <P>Regarding mountain climbers, officers of National Police Agency (NPA) said there
are not many climbers left on the mountains given that two other tropical storms
-- Pabuk and Wutip -- passed over Taiwan during the last week.</P>
      <P>According to NPA statistics, 426 mountain climbers from 86 groups have already
left the mountains as of Friday noon, while eight climbers who were already on
various mountains chose to cease their journey and seek shelter from the storm's
winds.</P>
      <P>As for the Chinese fishing boats that ran ashore Taiwan's coasts to avoid the
strong winds, officials of Coast Guard Administration have arranged temporary

      <P>Formosa Plastic Group pledged Friday that it will donate 578,000 pneumococcus
vaccines, worth NY$460 million (US$13.92 million), to the government over the
next three years.</P>
      <P>Susan Wang, deputy chief executive officer of Formosa Plastic and a daughter of
group founder Wang Yung-ching, announced the gift to the government during a
ceremony at the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH).</P>
      <P>Accepting the gift on behalf of the government, DOH head Hou Sheng-mou thanked
Formosa Plastics for its generous charity work. He said Formosa Plastic is the
first enterprise in Taiwan to donate vaccines to help the needy and urged other
businesses to follow its example.</P>
      <P>DOH officials said that because the number of vaccines is limited, they will
begin the free vaccination program this year with elderly people in the counties
of Yunlin and Chiayi who are 75 years old or over.</P>
      <P>Susan Wang said that her 90-year-old father had developed pneumonia after
catching a cold several years ago, and that after he was cured, he accepted a
doctor's suggestion that he take a pneumococcus vaccine, with very satisfactory
results.</P>
      <P>She added that her father felt that elderly people aged 75 or over should all be
vaccinated against the pneumococcus bacteria, and that was why Formosa Plastics
decided to donate the vaccines to the government.</P>
      <P>Pneumococcus  is a leading  cause of pneumonia  and other infections, including
middle ear infection and meningitis. According to statistics compiled by the
DOH, pneumonia ranks fifth among the 10 leading causes of death in Taiwan, with
children aged 5 or under and people who are 65 or over being the high-risk
groups.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and China have nearly wrapped up bilateral technical talks on setting up
direct charter service and opening Taiwan to Chinese tourists, and will continue
to engage on the remaining issues, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Chen
Ming-tong said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while delivering a keynote speech at a seminar sponsored
by the National Association of Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>As most of the technical details regarding the two matters have been settled,
the two sides are currently seeking breakthroughs in remaining unsolved issues
so as to materialize cross-strait charter flights and allow the entry of Chinese
tourists to Taiwan as soon as possible, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Brushing aside allegations that the MAC has always stood in the way of cross-
strait exchanges since the Democratic Progressive Party came to power in 2000,
he said that over the past seven years the government has been consistent in its
China policy, focusing on boosting two-way trade and economic activities  amid
increased regional integration and growing globalization.</P>
      <P>Citing Chinese government statistics, Chen reported that as of the end of June,
Taiwan's investment in China had snowballed to US$58.6 billion. Unofficial
figures might amount to between US$100 billion and US$200 billion, he added.</P>
      <P>But the MAC chief failed to unveil a timetable for charter flight services to
kick start and the arrival of the first wave of regular Chinese tourists, and
called on China to cast aside political concerns and step up the pace of
negotiations in order to make a genuine breakthrough.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's national identity is in an unstable state, with differences existing
between its two major groups of people -- mainlanders and native Taiwanese, an
Academia Sinica researcher said Friday.</P>
      <P>Wu Nai-teh of the Academia Sinica Institute of Sociology made the remarks in a
report on Taiwanese people's national identity to a forum held by the
preparatory office of the planned National Center for Research and Protection of
Cultural Properties in Tainan, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the term mainlanders refers to Chinese immigrants who arrived after
1949 with the relocation of the Republic of China government, and native
Taiwanese is the term used for those who moved to Taiwan from China in the
several hundered years prior to 1949.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of a survey, Wu said 63 percent of the respondents would
support Taiwan independence if there was no threat of war with China. Should
China ever become democratic, nearly 50 percent of those polled said they would
support the unification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The results show that Taiwan's national identity is unstable, Wu concluded,
noting however that even with the different opinions, the two groups of
Taiwanese people share a common consensus on Taiwan's future, which is that
"only Taiwanese people have the right to decide Taiwan's future."</P>
      <P>The trend among mainlanders, despite having what he described as "a strong
complex about China, " is to accept the Taiwan independence movement even though
they are still not willing to give up their wish for unification.</P>
      <P>The "de-sinicization" movement -- a reference to the government's move over the
past year to change state-run companies' designations that carry the word
"China, " has harmed mainlanders' feelings, making them to feel they are not
respected in the country, according to Wu.</P>
      <P>At the same forum, Government Information Office Minister Shieh Jhy-wey said it
is "not necessary for people sharing a common culture to form a single country,
" referring to Taiwan's bid for membership in the United Nations despite the
opposition of Beijing, which regards Taiwan as part of China.</P>

      <P>Chen made the remarks at the opening ceremony of the National Defense University

ocean waters -- Chen said Taiwan will have to be ready to face immediate threats
from the enemy because it will have little warning ahead of an attack.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan will not have a single, well-defined front line to defend in
case of wars, Chen added, urging the NDU, the cradle of the country's high-
ranking military officers, to train the three branches of the nation's military
forces for joint operations and thereby beef up Taiwan's combat capability.</P>

      <P>A group of pig farmers, led by a Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) lawmaker,
launched a lawsuit Friday against Department of Health (DOH) Minister Hou Sheng-
mao and Bureau of Food Sanitation Director-General Cheng Hui-wen over the DOH's
decision to allow the use of a previously banned animal drug.</P>
      <P>TSU lawmaker Yin Ling-ying and hog raisers lodged the lawsuit against Hou and
Cheng at the Taipei Prosecutors Office on charges of dereliction of duty after
the DOH announced Tuesday that it has decided to relax the ban on ractopamine --
a veterinary drug which promotes lean meat in livestock -- by the end of this
month.</P>
      <P>Ractopamine is banned in Taiwan, but two shipments of imported U. S. pork were
found last month to contain the illicit drug, stirring up food safety concerns
among local consumers.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan Spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey said a day earlier that the ban will be
eased in late Aug. and U.S. imports containing minimum levels of ractopamine
residue in different organs of pigs and cattle and their meat will be permitted,
if no one voices opposition to the plan by Aug. 21.</P>
      <P>In view of the government's softened stance on the banned drug, thousands of hog
raisers from across the country are slated to demonstrate in front of the DOH
Aug. 21 should it fail to repeal the decision.</P>
      <P>Yin accused the DOH of failing to detect ractopamine-tainted pork imports and
criticized its arbitrary decision to remove the ban as a way to allow
questionable U.S. imports to enter Taiwan. Arguing that the DOH has to put the
public health concern in the first place, she lashed out at Hou for
"hoodwinking" the public by amending the regulations pertaining to animal drug
residue to facilitate U. S. imports.</P>
      <P>Yin threatened to take pig raisers to the streets Aug. 22 and fully boycott U.S.
pork if the DOH ignores their demands.</P>
      <P>According  to Lee Chen-jung,  chairman  of the pig-raising association in Taipei
County, the government's tailor-made opening to U.S. pork imports will have a
profoundly negative impact on local husbandry, consumers, vendors and food
processors.</P>
      <P>The local industry is gravely concerned  that the use of ractopamine will pose
serious risks to the public's health, but the government remains obstinate on
its decision to ease the ban, Lee said.</P>
      <P>In the face of mounting social pressure, Cheng said that he feels at ease and
justified in his decision, while Hou's aides said that the DOH chief remains
calm and tranquil despite the lawsuit.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ten female Vietnamese detainees escaped early Friday from the No. 2 detention
center run by the Immigration Agency in Yilan County, northeastern Taiwan,
agency officials said later that day.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, detention center workers found out about the
breakout when they took the roll call.</P>
      <P>After searching the center, personnel found the runaways had used an
oxyacetylene torch to burn through the bars on a window in their second-floor
dormitory, from where they jumped out and escaped from the center, which has no
high walls or fences, at around 4 a.m.</P>
      <P>The detention center authorities suspected that accomplices might have helped
the women, who were to be repatriated, to escape. "This seems to have been a
well-planned escape, " they said, adding that human trafficking rings might have
been working behind the scenes to induce the women to escape.</P>
      <P>As of 7 a.m., one of the women had been arrested by a police and Immigration
Agency officers.</P>
      <P>It was the second such case in Yilan County since the beginning of this month
after five male Vietnamese laborers ran away from the county's No. 1 detention
center Aug. 1.</P>
      <P>The Immigration Agency said in a statement issued later in the day that it will
punish negligent officials and immediately further step up security measures and
inspections at its detention centers across the country to prevent further
breakouts.</P>
      <P>The agency admitted that poor equipment and lack of deterrent facilities were
the main reasons for the success of the breakout.</P>
      <P>As the agency's detention centers are designed to house illegal immigrants
temporarily prior to repatriation, they are not walled or enclosed by wire out
of humanitarian considerations.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Chen Chin-de of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party suggested that
the central government increase budgets to better manage and upgrade facilities
at detention centers for illegal immigrants.</P>
      <P>In addition, he went on, the government also should step up its pace of
repatriation of illegals.</P>

      <P>Seven business groups representing various industries have promised to reduce
energy consumption as part of a national effort to improve energy conservation
and energy efficiency, a top energy official said Friday.</P>
      <P>The seven groups made the pledge Thursday during a symbolic flag presentation
ceremony marking the establishment of energy service teams among their
organizations to promote energy conservation, according to Bureau of Energy
Director-General Yeh Huey-ching.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the goal of the campaign is to cut power consumption by 2-3 percent,
which would result in savings of the equivalent of approximately 170,000 tons of
oil, and thereby prevent the release of 460,000 tons of carbon dioxide
emissions.</P>
      <P>The effect of the reduction in emissions would be equivalent to planting enough
trees to fill 1,200 parks the size of Taipei's Daan Forest Park, Yeh said,
adding that if the target is reached, it is expected to save NT$2.1 billion in
expenditures.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the government has developed various energy conservation promotion
projects over the past few years, and this year it has invited many private
enterprises to join in its conservation drives in the hope of encouraging them
to take the lead in voluntary energy conservation among business organizations.</P>
      <P>Under the project, the government will help those business groups train energy
conservation experts and set up energy management systems, Yeh added.</P>
      <P>The seven groups taking part in the energy conservation drive are TFT-LCD
manufacturer Au Optronics. Corp., China Steel Corp., paper and tissue maker
Cheng Loong Group., Chang Chun Chemical, food and drink producer Weichun Co.,
Shinkong Synthetic Fibers Corp. and contract chip maker United Microelectronics
Corp., Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Most of thouse groups have been winners of various energy conservation
competitions launched by the Bureau of Energy since 1988, Yeh noted.</P>

      <P>More than 70 percent of respondents to a recent survey have thrown their support
behind the country's bid to join the United Nations under the name of Taiwan,
officials from the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Friday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by National Chengchi University's Election Study Center
under the commission of the MAC. Questionnaires were administered via telephone
to randomly chosen adults from Aug. 10-12 and 1,095 valid samples were
collected.</P>
      <P>Quoting the survey results, MAC Vice Chairman Liu Te-hsun said 67 percent of the
public ascribe Taiwan's difficulties in participating in international
organizations and developing diplomacy to oppression by China.</P>
      <P>Moreover, 81.5 percent of the respondents said they favor maintaining the status
quo in a broader sense, and 67.8 percent said they do not agree with the "one
country, two systems" model by which China wants to rule Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The survey also shows that 78 percent of those polled do not accept China's
claim that Taiwan is part of China and "not qualified to apply for membership of
the United Nations."</P>
      <P>Liu said Taiwan is an independent sovereignty and that the government is
promoting the bid to participate in the international body under the name of
Taiwan based on the people's will. He called on the international community to
support Taiwan's U.N. bid.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Prosecutors to appeal ex-mayor's embezzlement case</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Prosecutors said Friday they will appeal the Taipei District Court's not guilty
ruling on a "special allowance fund" embezzlement case involving former Taipei
Mayor Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>One of the major reasons cited by prosecutors to back their decision to appeal
the case was what they said the judges' criticism of prosecution's investigation
into Ma's personal bank accounts.</P>
      <P>Noting that judges' should follow the criminal procedural law in handling any
judicial case, a spokesman fo the Taipei Prosecutors Office said the judges had
offended the division of powers principle enshrined in the procedural law that
bans prosecution and judges from infringing upon each other's powers and duties.</P>
      <P>"Judges are not in a position to question how prosecutors will exercise their
investigation powers," the spokesman said, adding that scrutinizing Ma's
personal accounts is necessary in checking the flow of the mayoral allowance
funds that were deposited into his account.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is now the main opposition Kuomintang's candidate for the 2008
presidential election, was indicted Feb. 13 on suspicion of diverting NT$11.17
million in government funds into his personal account during his tenure as
Taipei mayor from 1998-2006. The "not guilty" verdict is believed to have
removed a dark shadow over Ma's presidential bid.</P>
      <P>Another reason cited by prosecutors to justify their appeal was disputes over
the truthfulness and validity of the deposition of a key witness in the case --
Wu Li-ju, a Taipei city government cashier.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the judges' denial of the validity of Wu's testimony was arbitrary
and biased, prosecutors said the verdict was statement taken out of context.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors also said the description about the mayoral special allowance fund's
nature, function and implication given in the verdict was incoherent,
contradictory and incongruant with theoretical and empirical principles.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors must formal file their appeal with the Taiwan High Court within 10
days after receiving the verdict.</P>

      <P>Prices of vegetables and fruit recorded an 11-percent drop Saturday in Taipei's
wholesale markets compared with the previous day's level, according to
statistics released by the Taipei Typhoon Sepat Disaster Prevention and Control

      <P>The presidential candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said
Saturday that he opposes the idea of forming a Taiwan-China common market but
supports proposals to open wider the doors for tourist exchanges and chartered
flights between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Frank Hsieh said he opposes the proposal by his election rival, Ma Ying-jeou of
the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), to launch direct air links between Taiwan
proper and China. However, he said Taiwan can expand chartered cross-strait
flights that operate during holidays and festivals such as Chinese New Year.</P>
      <P>He also said he agrees with proposals to allow Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan
and to permit Chinese investors to buy real estate in Taiwan. Hsieh made the
remarks at a workshop held in Taichung, central Taiwan, by a local industry
association.</P>
      <P>He said that while pursuing economic development, Taiwan should at the same time
make efforts to make the people happy.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan's economic problems are mostly caused by political disputes
and claimed that if he wins the 2008 election, he will first try to settle the
conflicts between the ruling and opposition parties before making efforts to
seek a majority in the Legislative Yuan, which would help the government carry
out its policies.</P>
      <P>Talking about his cross-strait policy, Hsieh said he approves of the idea of
lifting bans on cross-strait transport, trade and postal links, but opposes the
idea of forming a cross-strait common market, claiming that through such a
market, cheap agricultural products, substandard goods and cheap labor from
China would flow into Taiwan, affecting market and social order.</P>
      <P>Speculating that there will be an outflow of investment from China in five years
due to increasing appreciation of the Chinese yuan and increasing labor costs
there, Hsieh said such an outflow would be a good chance for Taiwan to attract
funds from China.</P>

Specifically, the central bank lowered the discount rate, charged on direct Fed

      <P>The officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) issued the warning
after discovering that several Taiwanese citizens have been arrested by
Malaysian police for involvement in fraud cases in that country.</P>
      <P>Initial investigations show that those Taiwanese people had traveled to Malaysia
to work as "sales people" whose job was to inform others by phone of having won

      <P>Also cited were New York Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman and Adele
Smithers,  chairman of the Christopher D.  Smithers Foundation.</P>
      <P>Wang received a citation from Ray Negron, a special aide to Yankees principal
owner George Steinbrenner. Negron said Wang has not only emerged as one of the
most promising pitchers in the U.S. Major League but has also made great
contributions to community services.</P>
      <P>According to Negron, Wang has never turned down an invitation to take part in
public-interest activities. He often visits hospitals to play with ailing
children. Earlier this year, Wang attended the groudbreaking ceremony for the
Yankees Stadium station on a new metro railway line.</P>
      <P>Nearly 400 children from disadvantaged families also attended Friday's citation
ceremony and lunched with Wang and other Yankees baseballers.</P>
      <P>Wang said he felt honored to receive the citation, adding that he enjoys playing
with children. Children from underprivileged families require more concern and
help, he added.</P>
      <P>At the ceremony, Wang received a surprise gift -- a color portrait of him --
from James Fiorentino. The noted artist said he spent two days painting  the
portrait based on Wang's photo. Fiorentino said he was delighted to present the
painting to Wang in person. Praising the painting as a masterpiece, Wang said
it's an invaluable gift for him.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has incurred tremendous agricultural losses from the recent spate of
storms,  officials  from the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Strong southwest air current began to hammer Taiwan Aug. 10, bringing torrential
rain to central and southern Taiwan, and Typhoon Sepat came on the heels,
rattling the entire country with strong winds and heavy rain.</P>
      <P>According to COA tallies, torrential downpours and high winds brought by
southwest air current and Typhoon Sepat caused more than NT$830 million
(US$25.15 million) in agricultural losses, with the southernmost county of
Pingtung and the eastern county of Hualien suffering most devastation.</P>
      <P>Pingtung County alone incurred NT$260 million in agricultural losses as
floodwaters brought by southwest air current inundated large swaths of farmland,
while Hualien County ran up NT$250 million in crop losses, COA officials.</P>
      <P>As Typhoon Sepat lashed Hualien with gale-force winds, more than 1,000 hectares
of pomelo orchards were decimated, with the windfall rate reaching 60 percent,
the officials said.</P>
      <P>The neighboring  county  of Taitung  also  suffered  heavy agricultural losses,
with nearly half of its pomelo crop destroyed. County officials said the supply
of pomelo, a major fruit for Mid-Autumn Festival, which falls on Sept. 25, could
be cut by half.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taipei city government said 14 of its citizens were injured when
Typhoon Sepat hammered the city. Most of them sustained only minor injuries,
city officials said.</P>
      <P>According to the capital city's emergency response and disaster relief center,
848 houses reported power blackout and 302 trees were uprooted by strong winds.
Two landslides were reported in hillside areas and 15 vehicles were affected by
falling tree branches.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's economy ranked as the 22nd largest in the world in 2006 with a gross
domestic product (GDP) totaling US$355.7  billion,  according  to the latest
tallies from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</P>
      <P>According to IMF tallies published in April this year, Taiwan was the world's
20th largest economy in 2004, with a GDP totaling US$322.3 billion, but was
surpassed by Turkey in 2005, to fall to 21st place with a GDP of US$346.7
billion.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was also surpassed in 2006, this time by Indonesia, dropping back another
notch to rank as the world's 22nd largest economy with a GDP of US$355.7
billion, IMF tallies indicated.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan ranked 21st in the world in terms of GDP in 2006 according to
tallies from the Directorate  General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics,
which calculated Taiwan's GDP to be US$364.2 billion last year.</P>
      <P>The IMF forecast that Taiwan would retain its GDP ranking this year, remaining
the world's 22nd largest economy with its GDP dollar estimate -- the value of
all final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year --
totaling some US$365.3 billion.</P>
      <P>The United States was the world's largest economy in 2006, with a GDP totaling
US$13.24 trillion,  followed by Japan at US$4.37 trillion, Germany with US$2.89
trillion, and China with a GDP of US$2.63 trillion, according to the IMF.</P>
      <P>According to a domestic financial analyst, Taiwan's world GDP ranking could be
slightly lower given a weaker New Taiwan dollar after the GDP calculated in
Taiwan currency is converted into greenbacks for the GDP dollar estimate.</P>

      <P>Agricultural losses to Typhoon Sepat in Hualien County, eastern Taiwan,
exceeded  NT$300 million, the county's bureau of agriculture reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau's estimates, Hualien county suffered some NT$310 million
in farm and agricultural losses when Typhoon Sepat hit the eastern county
Saturday, with townships in its central and southern areas bearing the brunt of
the disaster.</P>
      <P>Locally grown pomelos were most affected by the typhoon, with 729 hectares, or
63 percent of its production on 1,161 hectares of farmland ruined, bureau
officials said.</P>
      <P>The effect of the lost pomelo crop on the domestic market remains to be seen,
officials said, adding that the top priority now is to help farmers overcome
their monetary difficulties.</P>
      <P>Hualien produces about one third of Taiwan's pomelos, which is the major
seasonal fruit consumed in the annual Mid-autumn Festival, now little more than
one month away.</P>
      <P>Hualien is also a prime production site for watermelons and bananas, with nearly
50 percent and 64 percent, respectively, of those harvests ravaged.</P>
      <P>Sepat, the strongest typhoon to hit Taiwan so far this year, landed on eastern
Taiwan Saturday morning and left the island early Sunday of the same day on its
way to China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jhy-wei said Sunday that the government has yet
to make a final decision on the use of ractopamine -- an animal drug that
promotes the growth of lean meat in livestock -- as several key elements must be
thoroughly studied.</P>
      <P>Shieh made the remarks to reporters after the China Times reported that ranking
Executive Yuan officials are set to make a U-turn on its previous decision to
lift the ban on ractopamine by following in Japan's suit and maintaining a ban
on its use by local pig farmers while allowing foreign pork imports containing
the substance to enter Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Shieh, the Executive Yuan has not made a final decision on the
issue as several factors have to be fully taken into account -- such as the
public's health concern, local hog farmers' interests and international norms.</P>
      <P>Although the Executive Yuan will do its best to assess the issue and strike a
balance among all sides, he acknowledged that it will be extremely difficult for
the government to satisfy all parties concerned.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan will have to respond to the new regulations set to be
published in Sept. by the World Trade Organization regarding the use of
ractopamine, which is currently banned in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) and the Council of Agriculture
(COA) announced last week that they will remove the ban by the end of this month
and permit minute levels of ractopamine residue in different organs in pigs and
cattle and their meat, spurring fierce oppositions from local pig raisers who
threatened to demonstrate in front of the DOH Tuesday if the government fails to
repeal the decision by Monday.</P>
      <P>Although ractopamine is banned in Taiwan, two shipments of U.S. pork imports
containing the unlawful drug were detected last month, provoking grave food
safety concerns among local consumers and stirring up strong social criticism
that the government has failed to apply the same standard to scrutinize foreign
imports.</P>
      <P>Local  hog raisers  said  they suspected  the government's announcement to lift
the ban was a result of U.S. pressure and accused it of turning a blind eye to
the public's health and farmers' livelihoods.</P>
      <P>In response  to the China Times  report,  Cheng  Hui-wen, director-general of
the DOH's Bureau of Food Sanitation, said that he is unable to answer the
question whether the government is intended to bring in "dual standards"
concerning ractopamine as he is not familiar with any "ranking Executive Yuan
officials."</P>
      <P>Any government decision on changes in this regard must be accepted by local
consumers and pig farmers, he said, noting that the levels of ractopamine
residue to be permitted by the government are safe and in compliance with
international regulations.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, the DOH and the COA share common ground in that they believe
the same criteria regarding the use of the animal drug must be applied to
foreign and local products and neither of them will move on its own to handle
foreign imports.</P>

      <P>The output value of Taiwan's contract chip makers in the third quarter is
expected to reach NT$121 billion (US$3.66 billion) , a 16.9 percent growth over
the previous quarter, thanks to growing market demand, according to an industry

Industry Association (TSIA).</P>
      <P>The Q3 output is likely to continue on an upward trend following decreases in
inventory levels caused by the growing demand for personal computers, mobile
phones and other consumer electronic products thanks to hot seasonal sales and
outsourcing of orders for nanotech products reported by integrated device
manufacturers, the report said.</P>
      <P>The TSIA predicted that the Q3 output will surge 5.49 percent over the same
period of the previous year.</P>

percent, to NT$64.3 billion from Q1, while the Q3 output is expected to top
NT$85 billion, showing a substantial surge of 32.2 percent over the previous
quarter due to a boost in DRAM makers' production capacity, advances in

      <P>Students from National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences (NKUAS) won
second place in the Dream Cup solar car race in Japan earlier this month, the
best ever performance of the NKUAS team in international solar car competitions,
a school source said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The 18-member NKUAS team competed in the top division of the 16th Japanese solar
car race held at Suzuka Circuit in Suzuka City, Mie prefecture Aug. 4-5 and lost
to the Japanese team, by eight rounds in endurance trials.</P>
      <P>The Suzuka Circuit solar car race attracted 80 teams, mostly from around Japan,
to compete in three divisions. The NKUAS team took part in the top division, the
only foreign team competing with seven Japanese teams for the Dream Cup.</P>
      <P>The Dream Cup, which began in 1992 with an aim to promote eco-friendly
automobiles, was jointly sponsored by Yomiuri Shimbun, Suzuka Circuitland Co.
and Japan Automobile Federation (JAF).</P>
      <P>After the race, NKUAS racers said that the Japanese solar cars were generally
very well-built and relatively better in terms of stability than the model that
the Taiwan team used.</P>
      <P>"There is certainly ample room for us to improve our equipment and techniques,"
said the NKUAS racers.</P>
      <P>Although the NKUAS-developed solar car -- which uses a solar panel on par with
U.S. aerospace industrial standards -- is far less efficient  than current
commercial  cars,  the NKUAS team has accumulated experience and skills making
and using environmentally friendly solar cars, and is seen as a rising star in
the field of transportation.</P>
      <P>The NKUAS team -- the one and only team of its kind in Taiwan -- has been
participating in international solar car races abroad since 2003.</P>

investigate soaring grocery prices in the wake of Typhoon Sepat, which swept
through Taiwan Saturday causing flash floods and landslides around the island.</P>
      <P>FTC officials will begin from Monday looking into whether traders of groceries,
particularly leafy vegetables, have hoarded produce or conspired to raise
prices.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the typhoon, which wreaked havoc on open fields in central,
eastern and southern Taiwan with strong winds and torrential rains, the prices
of leafy vegetables have skyrocketed, with the price of high-altitude Chinese
cabbage surging to NT$260 (US$7.8) per piece, and spring onions rising to NT$100
per catty (about 600 grams).</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  officials from the Taipei Agricultural Products Marketing Co.
forecast that higher grocery prices will probably persist throughout the next
half a month as a result of the passing typhoon and in anticipation of the
approach of the Zhongyuan Ghost Festival, during which Taiwan people will
prepare feasts as offerings for ghost from the nether world.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou, presidential candidate of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) for
the March 22, 2008 presidential election, unveiled Sunday his plantation plan
during a visit to Tainan County in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On a visit to Wushantou Reservoir -- the largest reservoir in Taiwan -- Ma
promised that if elected, he will immediately launch a plantation project on
some 50,000-hectare fallow farmland in Tainan and Chiayi counties to help
balance the country's carbon emissions in line with global efforts to reduce the
greenhouse effect.</P>
      <P>Ma also paid laid flower wreaths and bowed to a statue of Hatta Yoichi, a late
Japanese engineer who constructed a massive irrigation system in the Tainan and
Chiayi areas -- a prime granary for the country -- during the period of Japanese
rule of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, about 220,000 of Taiwan's 970,000 hectares of farmland are
fallow. He voiced his hope that in the future, the government  and the private
sector would cooperate in massive forestation to help protect natural
environments and conserve water resources -- which will be key national
development strategies in the coming 30 years.</P>
      <P>The forestation project might cost the national coffers up to NT$8 billion, but
it would help counterbalance 140 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions, he
explained.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Kyoto Protocol, Taiwan has to slash its carbon dioxide
emission by 5.8 percent during the coming 2008-2012 period based on its 1990
level, Ma said, adding that the best way to achieve the aim is to plant trees
and forests.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan fails to meet the target, the country's foreign trade will be
boycotted by the international community -- a development he said will pose
serious threat to its sustainable growth.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Pig farmers poised to demonstrate against easing ban on animal drug</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Local farmers said Sunday that they will demonstrate Tuesday in Taipei anyway,
despite a local newspaper report that the government is to retain the ban on
local use of an animal drug while allowing foreign imports containing the same
substance to enter Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin Min-chi, chairman of the pig-raising association in Taichung County, central
Taiwan, said that nearly 10,000 farmers from across the country are set to
demonstrate in front of the Department of Health (DOH) as scheduled because they
cannot accept the government's decision, adding that the government was "toying"
with the public's health and farmers' interests by planning to ease the ban on
the unlawful drug.</P>
      <P>Lin questioned how consumers could distinguish good products from bad if the
government is to permit ractopamine-tainted foreign imports to enter Taiwan, and
warned that easing the ban will pose great risks to consumers' health and deal a
heavy blow to local producers.</P>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers and its presidential candidate, Ma
Ying-jeou, voiced the same day their objections to a government planned removal
of its ban on ractopamine -- an animal drug that promotes the growth of lean
meat in livestock.</P>
      <P>Ma expressed his opposition to the government's plan to relax the ban during a
seminar with local pig farms on a visit to Tainan County, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The government's softened stance on the banned drug has stirred up fierce
opposition from local consumer groups and hog raisers who threatened to
demonstrate in front of the DOH Tuesday if it fails to back off from its
decision to lift the ban by Monday.</P>
      <P>The use of the illicit drug has provoke heated debates in society after two
shipments of U.S. pork imports were discovered last month to be ractopamine-
tainted, while local farmers are banned from using the substance.</P>
      <P>Arguing that the government must apply the same criteria to examinations of
local and foreign products to protect the health of Taiwan's people, Ma said
that he will back local farmers' opposition to lifting the ban so as to allow
tainted foreign imports to enter the country.</P>
      <P>Tainan hog farmers attending the seminar complained that U.S. pork imports laced
with ractopamine residue are low-end products and lashed out at the government
for discriminating against local people by seeking to permit such foreign
imports.</P>
      <P>"We will never accept such double-dealing from the government," they asserted.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmakers also said that they are firmly opposed to easing the ban on
ractopamine whatever the reason cited by the government.</P>
      <P>Chou Shou-hsun, a KMT legislative caucus whip, said that the government must not
undermine local farmers' interests and the public's health under any
circumstances.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Tuesday's demonstration by hog raisers, Chou said that the KMT
will not be involved in the protests to avoid clouding the issue with political
implications.</P>
      <P>The China Times daily newspaper reported Sunday on its front page that the
Executive Yuan is likely to reverse its earlier decision to lift the ban on
ractopamine by following Japan's example and maintaining a ban on its use by
local pig raisers while allowing pork imports containing the substance to enter
the domestic market.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan speaker Shieh Jyh-wei said the same day that the government has
not yet made a final decision regarding lifting the ban and the use of the
veterinary drug.</P>
      <P>Both the DOH and the Council of Agriculture (COA) reiterated their stance Sunday
evening that a final decision on whether to lift the ban will be made only once
both agencies have fully assessed the viewpoints of all parties concerned.</P>
      <P>The reported "double dealing" method to handle local and foreign products is not
the final conclusion, the COA said.</P>

torrential rains.</P>
      <P>According to the Council of Agriculture, losses since Aug. 10 total some
NT$941.34 billion, with Hualien and Pingtung counties bearing the brunt of the
damage, losing NT$300 million and NT$260 million respectively, and together
accounting for more than half of the country's losses.</P>
      <P>Damaged crops made up the bulk of the losses, totalling NT$784.38 million over
13,180 hectares of farmland. Especially hard hit were pomelo and banana
orchards, and watermelon, cantaloupe, honey dew and leafy vegetable farms.</P>
      <P>Poultry and livestock farmers have seen losses of more than NT$72.94 million,
including the deaths of 1,287 pigs, 631,000 chickens, 145,000 ducks and 23,000

      <P>Fish farmers suffered damages costing NT$77.31 million as 128.65 hectares of
fishing ponds in Pingtung County, and 3 hectares of fishing ponds in Yunlin
County were flooded.</P>
      <P>Forestry lost NT$350,000, mostly in the form of seedlings drowned by the rains.</P>
      <P>Other losses include damaged farm facilities, as well as damaged fowl and
livestock shelters.</P>
      <P>However, a council official said there will not be a shortage of vegetables on

      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) announced Monday that all Boeing
737-800s in Taiwan will be grounded temporarily  for safety inspection  after a
Boeing 737-800 of Taiwan-based China Airlines (CAL) burst into flames at
Okinawa's Naha international airport earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>CAA Director-General Chang Kuo-cheng said at a news conference called after the
mishap that all 14 Boeing 737-800s currently in service in Taiwan -- including
the 12 owned by CAL and two belonging to Mandarin Airlines -- will be grounded
temporarily for thorough safety checks.</P>
      <P>The CAL Boeing 737-800, flight CI-120, caught fire shortly after landing at
Okinawa's Naha international airport at 10: 26 a.m. local time.</P>

      <P>All 157 passengers, including 17 Japanese citizens and 24 other foreign
nationals, and eight crew members managed to escape before fire engulfed the
entire plane.</P>
      <P>Chang said that according to preliminary findings, the cause of the engine fire
may be related to the plane's fuel supply system. So the Boeing 737-800 safety
checks will focus on the planes' fuel supply system, engines, pumps and other

      <P>Meanwhile, according to Chang, a delegation of nine officials from the CAA, the

      <P>Taiwan incurred heavy agricultural losses valued at more than NT$1.2 billion
(US$36.49 million) as a result of the recent spate of storms, including Typhoon
Sepat, according to statistics released Monday by the Council of Agriculture
(COA).</P>
      <P>Since early August, Taiwan has been under the influence of a strong
southwesterly air current that had caused heavy downpours in the central and
southern regions, while Typhoon Sepat pounded Taiwan with torrential rain and
strong wind on Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to the COA, 19,083 hectares, or 27 percent of the country's farmland
has been damaged, with zero crop harvest for 5,190 hectares.</P>
      <P>Hualien County in eastern Taiwan suffered the greatest losses, reaching NT$340
million, followed by Pingtung County in the south, with losses of NT$280
million, Yunlin County in central Taiwan at NT$180 million, and Taitung in
southeastern Taiwan at NT$100 million, according to the tallies.</P>
      <P>Pomelo orchards were hit the hardest, along with bananas, watermelons, melons
and leafy vegetables.</P>
      <P>Poultry and livestock raisers suffered losses of over NT$78.54 million,
including the deaths of 3,025 pigs, 678,000 chickens, 186,000 ducks and 38,000
geese.</P>
      <P>Fish farmers suffered damages worth NT$71.76 million, with 142.65 hectares of

      <P>Forestry lost NT$38.84 million, with 225.45 hectares of woodland and 146.2
hectares of seedlings destroyed by heavy downpours and gales.</P>
      <P>Other losses include damaged farming and fishing facilities, such as fowl and
livestock shelters, as well as fish breeding ponds.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung visited the worst-hit region of Hualien earlier

43 percent of the figure from Aug. 18, with the wholesale price of vegetables
surging to NT$37.5 per kilogram. The wholesale price prior to the typhoon was a
little over NT$20 per kilogram, the spokesman said.</P>

wholesale price of cabbage, which was affected the most by the typhoon,
increased to NT$140 per kilogram, while that of cucumber surged to about NT$120

    <TEXT>
      <P>The private Consumers' Foundation urged Taiwan consumers Monday to boycott pork
imported from the United States, which might contain the banned veterinary drug
ractopamine.</P>
      <P>At a news conference held over the government's about-face on the policy on the
use of ractopamine in pigs and cattle, foundation officials called for Taiwan
consumers to reject imported American pork and fast food that might also use
ractopamine-contaminated American pork.</P>
      <P>You Kai-hsiung, secretary-general of the foundation, criticized the government
for having succumbed to U.S. pressure by lifting its ban on ractopamine, which
the Council of Agriculture (COA) banned last October after cases were reported
abroad concerning the effect of the drug on consumers' cardiac and neural
systems.</P>
      <P>Citing seven cases related to ractopamine poisoning reported in Hong Kong and
the Chinese province of Guangdong between 1997 and 2006, You said more than 100
people in these two areas developed symptoms,  including  racing  heartbeat,
dizziness,  difficulty breathing, headache, muscle cramp, vomiting, diarrhea and
high blood pressure, after consuming pork containing ractopamine. One Chinese
patient died 15 days after being rushed to hospital, he added.</P>
      <P>Besides, You said, ractopamine -- marketed under the brand name Paylean -- a
phenolethanolamine s-adrenoceptor agonist that is used for the improvement of
weight gain, carcass leanness and feed efficiency in animals -- could also enter
fetuses through the placenta and cause damage if consumed by pregnant women.</P>
      <P>Currently, he said, ractopamine is not banned in only 24 countries, including
Japan and the United States, and is banned in over 160 countries, including
Taiwan, China and the European Union.</P>
      <P>A Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Friday that the government
did not receive any pressure from the United States to lift its ban on
ractopamine ahead of its decision to relax the ban.</P>
      <P>MOFA deputy spokeswoman Yeh Fei-pi said the Department of Health (DOH)
tentatively decided to relax the ban Aug. 14 to permit low levels of ractopamine
residue in pigs and cattle after conducting a thorough assessment of the impact
of the drug on public health and food safety.</P>
      <P>The relaxing of the ban also has nothing to do with President Chen Shui-bian's
upcoming transit stop on U.S. soil as alleged by some media outlets, according
to Yeh.</P>
      <P>According to a proposed revision to the DOH's standards for veterinary drug
residues, the maximum allowable level of ractopamine residue in pigs and cattle
would be 10 ppb in muscle and fat tissue, 40 ppb in the liver and 90 ppb in the
kidneys.</P>
      <P>If the proposal meets no objection by Aug. 21, the new standards can be
implemented at the end of the month at the earliest, DOH officials said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian Monday lambasted opposition members struggling to
protect the privileges of the past authoritarian rulers of Taiwan, claiming that
those who refuse to face up to history are "bound to be eliminated" by history.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while addressing a pictorial exhibition held at the
National Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall to mark the 100th anniversary of the
birth of the late opposition movement activist Kuo Yu-hsin. He was referring to
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) politicians who have used every possible  means to
block  the Democratic Progressive Party administration's decision to rename the
Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in Taipei as the National Taiwan Democracy
Memorial Hall.</P>
      <P>Describing Kuo as a forerunner of Taiwan's opposition movement and a founding
father of Taiwan's democracy, Chen said it is very meaningful that the
exhibition is being held at the renamed memorial hall that was originally built
in memory of Chiang -- the dictator who persecuted Kuo and forced him into exile
in the United States in the 1970s.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Kuo started pushing for democratic reforms in Taiwan 50 years
ago, including organizing an opposition party, promoting  direct  presidential
elections,  pressing  for  the depoliticization of the military and promoting
the establishment of a new country.</P>
      <P>However, Kuo, who died before the end of martial law in Taiwan 20 years ago, was
not able to witness the democratic achievements made by Taiwan over the past
seven years, including the termination of the KMT's 50 year-rule of Taiwan in
2000, the enactment of the Referendum Law in 2003 and the first national
referendum in 2004, Chen said, adding that in 2008, Taiwan will hold a second
national referendum to "deepen the country's democratic development."</P>
      <P>Chen noted that during the authoritarian rule by Chiang Kai-shek and his son,
Chiang Ching-kuo, Kuo stuck to his ideals despite the KMT's persecution, a move
that inspired many younger democratic activists, including Huang Hsin-chieh and
Yao Chia-wen.</P>
      <P>Chen said a lot of stories about Taiwan's pursuit of democracy remain untold and
that the memorial hall will further introduce other figures and incidents
crucial to the development of Taiwan's democratic movement, such as Lei Chen,
Huang Hsin-chieh, the Formosa Incident, the Chen Wen-cheng Incident and the
abolition of Article 100 of the Criminal Code.</P>
      <P>These stories will help the people realize that freedom and democracy are not
free gifts from heaven or granted by the dictators, Chen said, adding that the
democracy and progress of Taiwan were achieved with the sacrifice of life,
youth, blood and sweat.</P>

      <P>The wholesale prices of fruit and vegetables in Taipei have risen between 20
percent and 44 percent in the wake of Typhoon Sepat, Fair Trade Commission (FTC)
officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>The officials attributed the rise to the dual effects of reduced supply because
of the typhoon and increased demand boosted by consumer expectations of price
hikes.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a survey conducted by the FTC at the Taipei
Agricultural Product Marketing Co. -- the country's largest wholesale fruit and
vegetable market at a consumer destination, 643 metric tons of vegetables were
available Sunday, down 55 percent from 1,444 metric tons Saturday, with the
average price surging 20 percent from NT$30.9 to NT$37 per kilogram.</P>
      <P>The fruit supply was also down 59 percent from 851 metric tons Saturday to 345
metric tons Sunday, with the average price soaring 44 percent from NT$21 to
NT$30.2 per kilogram.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, another survey at the wholesale fruit and vegetable market in Hsilo,
Yunlin County -- the country's largest at a place of production -- indicates
that the vegetable supply was down 86 percent from 631 metric tons Friday to 88
metric tons Sunday, with the average price rising 4.9 percent from NT$28.3 to

      <P>The National Policy Agency (NPA) urged consumers Monday not to serve as
accomplices of intellectual property rights (IPR) pirates by buying counterfeit
products.</P>
      <P>An NPA spokesman made the call after police cracked down on many forgery
offenses around Taiwan over the past few weeks, seizing a wide range of
counterfeit products including sports appliances and clothing carrying protected
trademarks such as the "NY" logo of the New York Yankees.</P>
      <P>Recently, a large amount of counterfeit new-season Timberland garments and boots
appeared in night markets in southern Taiwan, sold at just 10 percent of the
genuine article, the NPA spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Even with intensive moves to crack down on counterfeiting, police have been
unable to root out the crime, the NPA spokesman said, calling for "consumers'
self-discipline."</P>
      <P>The NPA launched a national anti-pirate operation in early August,  in which
police  were mobilized  to crack  down on manufacturing, selling and smuggling
of counterfeit goods in night markets, shopping centers, factories and
warehouses around the country, as well as on the Internet.</P>
      <P>During the operation, police cracked 339 cases of IPR violation, arresting 402

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Monday that government  agencies should forge a
consensus  on the use of ractopamine -- an animal drug banned in Taiwan but used
to promote lean meat in livestock in some countries -- and allay public concerns
over its safety.</P>
      <P>Chang made the comments in Hualien County, eastern Taiwan during an inspection
of local pomelo orchards, where the crop was seriously damaged when Typhoon
Sepat swept through the county Saturday.</P>
      <P>A local newspaper reported Sunday that the Executive Yuan is likely to allow
ractopamine-tainted foreign imports to enter the country while retaining a ban
on its use by local hog raisers, prodding Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jhy-wei
to clarify later the same day that the government has not yet arrived at a final
decision on whether to lift the ban on the drug.</P>
      <P>Saying that he personally has no set position on this question, Chang said that
he has asked government agencies in charge of the issue, the Department of
Health and the Council of Agriculture, to consult all parties concerned as soon
as possible and build a consensus before coming to a final decision on whether
or not to lift the ban.</P>
      <P>The use of ractopamine became a social issue after two shipments of U.S. pork
imports were detected to contain ractopamine residue last month, spurring anger
from local farmers and health concerns from consumers who have vowed to take to
the streets against an easing of the ban. The veterinary drug is not banned in
the United States.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, pig farmers from across the country are set to demonstrate Tuesday in
front of the DOH, the COA and the Taipei office of the American Institute in

      <P>The government will not publish permissible levels of ractopamine residue in the
meat and organs of pigs and cattle Tuesday as a national consensus on the issue
has yet to be reached, Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey said Monday.</P>
      <P>Shieh made the remarks a day before the expiration of a period set by the
Department of Health (DOH) for local people to express their opinions or
opposition to proposed relaxation of a ban on ractopamine -- a veterinary drug
used as a feed addictive to promote growth of lean meat in livestock.</P>
      <P>Despite strong opposition from local pig farmers who are banned from using
ractopamine, the DOH unveiled Aug. 14 possibly permissible ractopamine residue
levels for meat and organs of pigs and cattle and said that the ban on the drug
may be lifted if no opposition is expressed by Aug. 21.</P>
      <P>Hog raisers  from across the country  have threatened  to demonstrate in front
of the DOH, the Council of Agriculture (COA) and the American Institute in
Taiwan (AIT) if the government fails to repeal the decision.</P>
      <P>The use of ractopamine has become a focal point after two shipments of pork
imported from the United States were found last month to contain residue of the
banned drug, and local farmers accused the government of bowing to U.S. pressure
by planning to allow the use of the drug, which is not banned in the United
States and some other countries.</P>
      <P>According to Shieh, the government will not necessarily legalize the permissible
ractopamine residue levels upon the expiration of the deadline, despite the
DOH's previous announcement.</P>
      <P>Shieh cited food safety and health concerns, local hog raisers' interests, the
DOH's and the COA's professional assessments and international regulations as
key elements to be considered by the government before it makes a final decision
on easing the ban.</P>
      <P>Until the government has answered all the public's questions and clarified
misconceptions surrounding ractopamine, the ban will not be relaxed, Shieh said,
adding that the Executive Yuan will definitely prioritize the public's health
when addressing relevant issues.</P>
      <P>As hog farmers will also stage protests at the COA Tuesday, COA officials are
prepared to meet them to exchange views and opinions, Shieh added.</P>
      <P>Shieh said Sunday that the government remained undecided on whether to remove
the ban on ractopamine after a local daily newspaper reported earlier that day
that the Executive Yuan was likely to make a U-turn in its decision to lift the
ban by retaining the ban on local farmers while allowing foreign imports
containing ractopamine residue to enter the country -- described by local
farmers as discriminatory "double dealing."</P>
      <P>Even though Shieh said the government has yet to make a final decision on the
issue, local pig-raising associations said that some 10,000 farmers from around
the country have vowed to demonstrate as slated Tuesday in front of the DOH, the
COA and the AIT against the government's softened stance.</P>
      <P>As the deadline for airing different opinions is drawing near, the DOH said
Monday that it is impossible for the government to adopt "dual tracks" to
regulate ractopamine residue on local and foreign products.</P>
      <P>Cheng Hui-wen, director-general of the DOH's Bureau of Food Sanitation, denied
Monday the alleged "dual tracks" and said that the DOH will not move on its own
to legalize ractopamine residue levels before the COA has officially announced a
lifting of the ban.</P>

      <P>The 2007 Cianggu, a pole-climbing event that has been annually held during Ghost
Month in the southern Taiwan township of Hengchun for over a century, will be
the largest ever and enjoy the addition of some "international flavor," an
official said Monday in a press conference.</P>
      <P>The pole-climbing competition, in which competitors of each team have to climb
barehanded up an 11-meter column, heavily greased with beef tallow, and snatch
the "lucky flag" at the top, will be expanded from four columns to 36 columns,
meaning that there will be 36 teams participating, including two teams of
foreigners, said Pingtung County Magistrate Tsao Chi-hung.</P>
      <P>The event will be held on the night of Aug. 27, the last day of a three-day
festival which also includes various cultural events, such as a street dance
competition, a parade, and rock concert.</P>
      <P>Cianggu is one of the most popular folk Ghost Month events in Taiwan -- the
seventh lunar month -- though in its human origins and background have always
been well represented,  said Tsao, who explained that the festival was held to
distribute the offerings worshipers made to ghosts to society's homeless, poor
and starving people.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the annual religious event has put two small towns on the cultural
map: Yilan County's Toucheng Township in the north and Hengchun, Pingtung County
in the south.</P>
      <P>"In the past, there were some foreigners in the competition, mixing in teams
with the locals, in the past, but they never competed as a separate team, "
Hengchun Mayor Yeh Ming-shun said, adding that a Thai team and a mixed team of
Americans, Indonesians and Japanese had registered to compete this year.</P>
      <P>The fastest team to climb to the top of the column and snatch the lucky flag
from the top platform typically places the flag at the front end of their boat,
symbolizing that they will enjoy the kindly protection of ghosts thorough the
year, Tsao said.</P>
      <P>With Hengchun's rich history, historical sites and cultural heritage, more
events have been planned for the future, Tsao said. Pingtung County government
is planning to hold an international folk song festival next year in Hengchun,
where well-known late folk singer Chen Da lived.</P>
      <P>Tsao believes the combination of the folk song festival, Cianggu and the Spring
Scream, a rock festival held annually in April, will boost Hengchun's tourism
and local business as well as its cultural awareness.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese investigative team left for the southern Japanese island of Okinawa
Monday afternoon to join Japanese aviation experts in investigating the cause of
an explosion of a Taiwan-based China Airlines (CAL) passenger jet plane earlier
this month.</P>
      <P>The team comprises CAL General-Manager Ringo Chao, officials from the Civil
Aeronautics Administration, and the Cabinet-level Aviation Safety Council.</P>
      <P>Before departure, Chao apologized to passengers for the accident, and expressed
hope of minimumizing the damage from the event. He said CAL will ensure
passengers' rights are respected and will provide a further explanation after
having a better understanding of the event in Okinawa.</P>
      <P>CAL's Boeing 737-800, flight CI-120 caught fire, starting in its left engine,
shortly after landing at Okinawa's Naha international airport at 10:26 a.m.
Monday.</P>
      <P>All 157 passengers onboard, including 17 Japanese citizens and 24 other foreign
nationals, were evacuated immediately after landing. Eight crew members managed
to escape before fire engulfed the entire plane.</P>
      <P>According to information provided by CAL, the exploded aircraft underwent its
mandatory annual examination and maintenance in July, and nothing abnormal was
found.</P>
      <P>The plane also underwent its Routine Event -- a routine maintenance check that
follows every 500 hours of flying time Aug. 4. The result appeared to be fine,
and the aircraft had no record of a recent heavy landing.</P>
      <P>All of CAL's 12 B737-800 aircraft, including the damaged one, are equipped with
engines manufactured by the French company CFM International. Two engines on the
exploded aircraft were examined as recently as July 6 and July 8, respectively,

      <P>The investigative team left at 4: 25 p.m. on the China Airlines Airbus A333,

interests when handling issues related to ractopamine -- an animal drug banned
in Taiwan but used in some countries to promote the growth of lean meat in
livestock.</P>
      <P>In the face of growing social opposition to possible easing of the ban on the
drug, allegedly to facilitate foreign imports, a group of DPP lawmakers urged
the government during a news conference held in the Legislative Yuan not to
remove the ban.</P>
      <P>Two shipments of U.S. pork imports were found last month to contain the illegal
substance, spurring public health concern and widespread discussion of the
ractopamine issue.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmakers from central and southern Taiwan have endorsed a petition calling
on the government to retain the ban on both local and foreign products to fully
ensure the public's health and protect local hog farmers' livelihoods.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Wu Ming-min said the local pig-farming industry will crushed if
ractopamine-containing foreign imports are allowed to enter the country, adding
that Taiwan consumers' health would also be affected in such a case.</P>
      <P>Another DPP lawmaker, Chen Hsien-chung, warned the government not to
underestimate the impact of a demonstration Tuesday by thousands of hog farmers
from across the country if it is set to relax the ban.</P>
      <P>Yen Wen-chang, also a DPP lawmaker, said he strongly opposes a reported  "dual
track"  solution  --  allowing  imports  of ractopamine-containing foreign pork
to enter Taiwan while banning local hog farmers from using the drug as a feed
addictive -- to address the issue.</P>
      <P>"Such a practice, if implemented, would be unfair to local farmers and could put
consumers' health at great risk," Yen said.</P>
      <P>Amid rampant speculation that the government may ease the ban to allow in
ractopamine-tainted imports while retaining the ban on local farmers, Executive
Yuan spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey said Sunday that the government has not yet reached
a conclusion concerning the matter, citing considerations for the public's
health, farmers' livelihoods and international regulations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Prosecution authorities have sought detention of two suspects in a political
contribution case allegedly involving Frank Hsieh, the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) presidential candidate, judicial sources said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors from the Special Investigation Task Force under the Supreme
Prosecutors Office applied for detention of Hsu Cheng-chao and Hsiao Ling-hui
after questioning them in probes into the case in which Hsieh was accused of
having embezzled nearly NT$10 million in political contributions to line his own
pocket during his tenure as mayor of the southern port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Hsu, president of the Kaohsiung Development Association, and Hsiao,  the
association's accountant, were suspected of having collected funds from board
members of the municipal Bank of Kaohsiung in the name of Hsieh back in 2002
when Hsieh was seeking re-election.</P>
      <P>Hsu and Hsiao allegedly had also asked hopefuls for seats on the bank's board of
directors to donate NT$1 million each as political contribution to Hsieh.</P>
      <P>They were first questioned as witnesses, but prosecutors later listed them as
suspects on charges of corruption, forgery and money laundering.</P>
      <P>But prosecutors said they have so far not yet found any evidence showing Hsieh's
involvement in the case.</P>
      <P>Three prosecutors from the Special Investigation Task Force -- Chu Chao-liang,
Wu Wen-chung and Lee Hai-lung -- traveled to Kaohsiung Monday morning to
interrogate seven witnesses in the case. Except for Hsu and Hsiao, all the five
others were released after questioning.</P>
      <P>The three prosecutors said they will expand investigations into bank accounts of
relevant personnel, but they didn't elaborate.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung District Court has yet to determine whether the two suspects --
Hsu and Hsiao -- should be taken into custody pending further investigations.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese investigative team left for the southern Japanese island of Okinawa
Monday afternoon to join Japanese aviation experts in investigating the cause of
an explosion of a Taiwan-based China Airlines (CAL) passenger jet plane earlier
this month.</P>
      <P>The team comprises CAL General-Manager Ringo Chao, officials from the Civil
Aeronautics Administration, and the Cabinet-level Aviation Safety Council.</P>
      <P>Before departure, Chao apologized to passengers for the accident, and expressed
hope of minimumizing the damage from the event. He said CAL will ensure
passengers' rights are respected and will provide a further explanation after
having a better understanding of the event in Okinawa.</P>
      <P>CAL's Boeing 737-800, flight CI-120 caught fire, starting in its left engine,
shortly after landing at Okinawa's Naha international airport at 10:26 a.m.
Monday.</P>
      <P>All 157 passengers onboard, including 17 Japanese citizens and 24 other foreign
nationals, were evacuated immediately after landing. Eight crew members managed
to escape before fire engulfed the entire plane.</P>
      <P>According to information provided by CAL, the exploded aircraft underwent its
mandatory annual examination and maintenance in July, and nothing abnormal was
found.</P>
      <P>The plane also underwent its Routine Event -- a routine maintenance check that
follows every 500 hours of flying time Aug. 4. The result appeared to be fine,
and the aircraft had no record of a recent heavy landing.</P>
      <P>All of CAL's 12 B737-800 aircraft, including the damaged one, are equipped with
engines manufactured by the French company CFM International. Two engines on the
exploded aircraft were examined as recently as July 6 and July 8, respectively,
and the results showed nothing abnormal.</P>
      <P>The investigative team left at 4: 25 p.m. on the China Airlines Airbus A333,
together with a group of reporters and passengers set to travel to Okinawa. The
aircraft will also carry returning passengers who traveled to Okinawa on the
plane which exploded and now wish to return to Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) approved
a plan Monday to inject NT$20.9 billion (US$633.52 million) over the next four
years to improve the competitiveness of Kaohsiung Port.</P>
      <P>The CEPD made the decision at regular a meeting of its members held to review
the development plans of three ports on the west coast of Taiwan -- Kaohsiung,
Anping, and Budai -- and Magong Port on the outlying island of Penghu.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taipei Port in Taipei County's Wanli township is near completion,
CEPD members said that after the new port becomes operational at the end of
2008, it is expected to cause Kaohsiung to lose 5 percent of its containers
business, estimated at 500,000 TEUs (20-foot equivalent units).</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung, Taiwan's largest port, was the world's third busiest container port
in 1999, but gradually lost its competitive edge and dropped to sixth place in
2005, according to a survey by London-based Container International monthly.</P>
      <P>The CEPD members expressed confidence that Kaohsiung harbor's annual container
handling will not show negative growth after the CEPD spends NT$20.9 billion
between 2007 and 2011 to renovate its wharves and improve its transport links in
an attempt to boost its competitiveness.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed Tuesday his resolve to safeguard the Taiwan
people's right to hold a referendum on the country's bid to join the United
Nations.</P>
      <P>Chen rejected a suggestion that he give up the referendum in exchange for better
treatment on his planned transit stops in the United States, saying the two
issues should not be linked or traded off against each other.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks before his departure for a three-nation visit to Central
America, which will include brief stopovers in the U.S. state of Alaska en route
to and from the region.</P>
      <P>Washington has reportedly refused to allow Chen to set foot in the continental
United States or stay overnight during the transit stops as a way of expressing
its displeasure with Taiwan's plan to push for a referendum on whether to apply
to join the United Nations under the name of "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Chen said that although Taiwan and the United States have maintained a
longstanding friendship and are strategic partners sharing the common values of
freedom and democracy, the two countries do not always see eye to eye on every
issue because of their different national interest concerns.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan will continue to communicate with the U.S. side to try to sort
out their differences on the referendum issue, adding that he does not want the
issue to complicate his U.S. transit plan and blur the focus of his Central
America visit.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the holding of referendums is a basic human right that not
even the head of state is allowed to block or restrict.</P>
      <P>As a sovereign country, Taiwan has the right to participate in the international
community, he added.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan not only must fight for international recognition and respect for the
country's sovereign status but also let the world hear the Taiwan people's
strong desire to become a full member of the World Health Organization and the
United Nations," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that China's diplomatic suppression of Taiwan has extended even to
non-political fields such as sporting events, the president urged the opposition
parties to give up what he called their "wishful thinking" that Taiwan could
find a way out of the current impasse by accepting the so-called "1992
consensus."</P>
      <P>According to Chen, accepting the "1992 consensus" would mean accepting Beijing's
"one China" principle and recognizing Taiwan is part of the People's Republic of
China, and by doing so, Taiwan would "lead itself up another blind alley."</P>

      <P>The government has no set position or any timetable for resolving the
controversy over the use of ractopamine -- an animal drug banned in Taiwan but
used in some countries to promote the growth of lean meat in livestock,  Premier
Chang Chun-hsiung said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks while answering reporters' questions on the issue after
thousands of pig farmers from across the country demonstrated earlier the same
day in front of the Department of Health (DOH) against a possible easing of the
ban on the use of the drug.</P>
      <P>Asserting that the government is doing its best to properly handle the issue,
Chang said he has instructed Vice Premier Chiou I-jen to coordinate the work of
relevant government agencies seeking to forge a consensus through extensive
consultations with concerned parties.</P>
      <P>Although the drug remains banned in Taiwan, the DOH made public Aug. 14
permissible ractopamine residue levels for meat and different organs in pigs and
cattle and said that these new guidelines would take effect by the end of this
month at the earliest if no opposition were voiced by Aug. 21.</P>
      <P>Local hog farmers said that they are firmly opposed to the government lifting
the ban on the use of ractopamine under strong foreign pressure.</P>
      <P>Many farmers believe that the DOH's announcement of new standards for
ractopamine residue levels is a scheme to clear the way for foreign imports
after two shipments of pork imported from the United States were found last
month to contain the substance.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) plans to provide NT$270 million (US$8.18
million) over three years to set up 450 sports centers on campuses around the
country in an effort to encourage students to exercise regularly and help them
cultivate lifestyles of health and sustainability (LOHAS), an MOE official said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chien Ming-chung, director of the MOE Department of Physical Education, said as
sports facilities have been lacking at all levels of schools nationwide,
particularly indoor exercise facilities, with only 18 percent of schools
equipped with such facilities, the MOE has decided to launch the program in
collaboration with local governments to help solve the problem.</P>
      <P>This year, the MOE will provide funds for 50 elementary and junior high schools
to set up LOHAS exercise centers, Chien said, adding that any school with more
than 12 classes, 300 students and two or three spare rooms is eligible to apply
for funding.</P>
      <P>The first LOHAS sports centers set up under the program are expected to open in
December, he said.</P>
      <P>Over the next two years, the program will be expanded to cover senior high
schools and vocational high schools, with NT$600,000 in funds to be provided for
each facility to be set up, he noted.</P>
      <P>He said the main appeal of the program is that it makes the most of spare space
on campuses, develops schools' creativity and special characteristics, aims to
set up diversified and attractive exercise facilities, and promotes healthy
exercise habits.</P>
      <P>Under the initial plan, the LOHAS sports centers will be furnished with an array
of popular indoor exercise equipment, such as dance machines, trampolines,
batting cages and climbing facilities, to spur interest in exercise among young
people.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung County officials responsible for health and environmental protection
affairs were mobilized Tuesday for an urgent undertaking aimed at preventing an
outbreak of dengue fever.</P>
      <P>County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsiung ordered officials to reinforce efforts to
cleanse mosquito-breeding sites after the southern county reported last week its
first indigenous dengue fever case this summer.</P>
      <P>The patient, a woman aged over 50, resides in the county's Fengshan City but
works in the neighboring city of Kaohsiung, County Director of Health Huang
Chih-chung said, noting that Kaohsiung City is one of southern Taiwan's dengue-
affected areas, with 52 cases of indigenous dengue fever reported so far since
the beginning of the summer.</P>
      <P>Tainan City is the area hardest hit by the mosquito-born disease, with 230 cases
indigenous dengue fever reported so far this summer. Tainan County has reported
17 cases, according to Huang.</P>
      <P>Huang said it is worrisome that there has been no sign of taming the outbreaks
in neighboring areas,  and that the density of disease-carrying mosquitoes has
reached alert-triggering levels in and around the county since repeated storms
brought heavy downpours over the past few weeks.</P>
      <P>To prevent a major outbreak, the county government has decided that whenever
there is a suspicious case reported it will be treated as a confirmed case and
the county will activate at once its standard anti-pest procedures, including
expanded probes into the disease source.</P>
      <P>Dengue fever, a viral illness, is manifested by the sudden onset of fever,
severe headache, muscle and joint pains, and skin rash. The classic dengue fever
lasts about six to seven days, with a smaller peak of fever at the trailing end
of the fever. It can be deadly when the patient is infected by the hemorrhagic
dengue fever.</P>

three years ago visited his clinic early this week complaining that one of her
breast had deflated after a hornet sting a couple of days before.</P>

      <P>Dr. Tseng said he found saline from the woman's breast implant had leaked,

      <P>He said the woman had to undergo a surgery to reconstruct her breast.</P>
      <P>Noting that the woman is quite skinny and has little fat tissue under her skin,
the doctor said it is possible that the hornet's sting could have pierced the

      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) will allow some 300 southern Taiwan
villagers displaced by Typhoon Sepat last week to be quartered temporarily in
disused army barracks in Pingtung County, a senior MND official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Maj. Gen. Huang Sung, head of the engineering division of the Bureau of Armament
and Acquisition, told reporters that officials from the MND and the Pingtung
county government had inspected the Ailiao barracks and will make necessary
preparations before more than 100 households move into the military housing.</P>
      <P>Huang said his division had dispatched 50 soldiers to clean up the 19 buildings
in the 3.7-hectare military base and that the Pingtung county government will
have water and electricity supplies laid on in three days.</P>
      <P>He added that the displaced villagers can live in the army barracks until they
have rebuilt their homes, which will take about 18 months with the assistance of
the Pingtung county government.</P>
      <P>The 300-odd people who lost their homes are from Haocha and Machia villages,
which were devastated by mudflows caused by torrential rain brought by Typhoon
Sepat.</P>

      <P>The government will spend NT$20.9 billion (US$633.53 million) improving
facilities at Kaohsiung Port in southern Taiwan to enhance its competitiveness
in anticipation of possible impact of the inauguration of Taipei Port's cargo
dock late next year, an official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The official of the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said
that the investment in Kaohsiung Port will be used to improve its connecting
transportation systems and reconstruct its old wharves between now and 2011,
with the aim of bringing further developments to the port.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Port is expected to lose 5 percent of its export cargo business, which
is about 500,000 TEU, after Taipei Port's cargo dock begins operations at the
end of 2008, the official said, adding that some of Kaohsiung Port's business of
transit cargo might be transferred to Taipei Port due to adjustments in shipping
routes.</P>
      <P>According to the official, ever-smaller information technology products have
affected the volume of cargo handled at Kaohsiung Port, which has registered
only single digit growth rate over the past five years. It is hoped that the
government's investment will prevent the port from losing more business and
ensure its future development.</P>
      <P>The official went on that the project was based on the Executive Yuan's
requirement that the operations of Taiwan's harbors be thoroughly reviewed every
five years as these tend to be affected by changes in both the economy and the
depreciation of facilities.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's balance of payments for international transactions registered a rare
deficit of US$1.89 billion in the second quarter of this year, the Taipei-based
Central Bank of China (CBC) reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan last registered an international payment deficit in the third quarter of
2004, when US$1.49 billion was reported, a CBC official said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the total payment deficit during the first half of this year reached
US$1.52 billion, the official attributed the deficit mainly to massive overseas
securities investments of US$28.17 billion made by local citizens.</P>
      <P>Due to a large interest rate difference between the new Taiwan dollar and the
U.S. dollar, Taiwanese people, local investment institutions and insurance
companies prefer to invest outside Taiwan, the official explained.</P>
      <P>The official added that local citizens invested US$17.21 billion in foreign
stocks and bonds during the second quarter of this year, setting the highest-

      <P>Statistics drawn from Britain's IELTS (International English Language Testing
System) average scores show that the English proficiency of Taiwanese students
lags behind that of most Asian countries, and Taiwanese are encouraged to do
more to learn English, the British Council said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The average score of Taiwanese students in the 2006 academic module of IELTS,
which has a top score of nine, was 5.62 points, ranking 17th overall and lagging
behind Asian countries including Japan, Korea, Vietnam and Thailand, said Iain
Mackie, Director of British Council's English Language Services.</P>
      <P>Germany ranked first among 20 countries listed, scoring 7.23. Malaysia, the
Philippines, Russia and Hong Kong rounded out the top five. Indonesia, Japan,
Vietnam, Korea, Pakistan and Thailand ranked 11th to 16th.</P>
      <P>"It's a little bit sad to say this but, in my opinion, the overall English
proficiency of Taiwan's working class has been going down in recent years. The
regression was probably a result of the booming numbers of universities, which
means it's much easier to obtain a college degree, " said Monica Chiu, Marketing
Director of 104 Job Bank.</P>
      <P>The average score of 5.62 actually was not bad. It's enough for Taiwanese
students to attend most universities in the U.K., said Mackie.</P>
      <P>But Mackie noted that most English teaching programs in Taiwan do not encourage
independent thinking, and most teaching materials are irrelevant to the real
world. He also said that most programs stress test taking instead of actually
using English to communicate.</P>
      <P>"According to our statistics, about 45 to 50 out of 100 job offers required
basic English proficiency and communication skills, which means anyone who is
competent in English will have twice as many job offers, " Chiu said.</P>
      <P>"English proficiency is also important for those who want to climb the corporate
ladder and win a promotion. Competency has become a basic requirement rather
than an advantage, " she noted.</P>

      <P>Another 89 cases of dengue fever were reported around Taiwan last week,
including 44 cases involving residents in a veterans' home in Tainan City's East
District, a Department of Health (DOH) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chou Chih-hau, deputy director-general of the DOH's Center for Disease Control
(CDC), said the cluster infection in Tainan was the largest in nearly 10 years.</P>
      <P>The first case of the cluster infection was reported Aug. 8, followed by more
cases Aug. 13 and 14. Tainan City's Health Bureau and the CDC then started
examinations of residents and inspected the environment around the veterans'
home, which houses more than 400 veterans in their 70s or 80s.</P>
      <P>The CDC discovered that 44 residents were infected with dengue fever and found
that drains on the roof and water reservoirs of the facility's air conditioners
were the main mosquito breeding areas.</P>
      <P>Chou said elderly people infected with dengue fever do not show obvious symptoms
of rash and high fever of up to 39 degree Celsius. He reminded nursing houses to
heed the situation and clean water storage containers around residences to avoid
another cluster infection.</P>
      <P>Chou said the North District of Tainan City also reported its second indigenous
dengue fever case -- a two-year-old girl who was diagnosed with the disease Aug.
6. She was discharged from the hospital Aug. 17.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's service sector accounted for 72.46 percent of GDP during the first
quarter of this year, showing growth of 1.67 percentage points over the 2004
figure, government officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to a report published by the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) , the figure also represented an increase of 3.53 percentage
points over the 2000 figure.</P>
      <P>Responding to the report regarding various flagship programs of Taiwan's service
sector, officials attributed the growth in output to the efficient
implementation of many projects and the government's having amended laws to
facilitate foreign investment in the service sector.</P>
      <P>For example, officials pointed to an amended law approved earlier this year will
allow foreign financial institutions to merge local banking organizations
through setting up subsidiaries in Taiwan, which officials said will facilitate
both the merger of financial institutions and financial globalization.</P>
      <P>On the service sector in telecommunications and media, officials noted that 5.66
million families around Taiwan had access to broadband Internet as of June this
year, while nearly 64.85 percent of Taiwanese families have Internet access.</P>
      <P>Regarding the design industry, a total of 315 local design products were
submitted to major design competitions around the world in the first half of
this year, with 39 products winning Germany's iF design awards and 33 gaining

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) and the Council of Agriculture (COA) agreed
Tuesday to retain a ban on ractopamine -- an animal drug to promote the growth
of lean meat in livestock that is banned in Taiwan but lawful in some countries
-- following protests by local pig farmers in front of the two agencies.</P>
      <P>DOH Minister Hou Sheng-mou signed a pledge agreeing to retain the ban on the
animal drug and promising that the DOH will not allow ractopamine-tainted
foreign imports to enter the county before the law is amended, and that it will
not unilaterally ease the ban but rather act in concert with the Council of
Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>Hou inked his name in the pledge after thousands of hog farmers demonstrated in
front of the DOH against a possible lifting of the ban by the government.</P>
      <P>Some 1,000 pig farmers from across the country later proceeded to the COA, where
Vice Minister Hu Fu-hsiung, witnessed by representatives from local hog-raising
associations and lawmakers, also made a pledge on behalf of COA Minister Su Jia-
chyuan, promising that the COA will maintain the ban on the veterinary drug.</P>
      <P>Farmers dropped their plan to protest in front of the Taipei office of the
American Institute in Taiwan after obtaining assurances from the DOH and the
COA.</P>

conference at the Legislative Yuan later the same day that all livestock farmers
across the country will take to the streets again if the government is found to
permit foreign imports with ractopamine residue to enter the local market.</P>
      <P>Angry hog farmers from central and southern regions got together in Taipei to
protest a possible relaxation of the ban on ractopamine by the government after
two shipments of U.S. pork imports were found to contain the substance last
month. A limited use of the animal drug is lawful in the United States and
Japan, while it is banned in more than 160 countries.</P>

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank Hsieh
should "do the right thing in making himself clear on the position and prospects
of the country," a coalition of pro-Taiwan independence groups said Tuesday at a
press conference.</P>
      <P>The coalition also submitted its own action plan for Taiwan's normalization as a
country Tuesday before the DPP Central Executive Committee begins to screen a
"normal country" resolution this week. It calls for Hsieh to make his position
clear to voters on the resolution.</P>
      <P>"A great statesman should follow the example of former Japanese Prime Minister
Junichiro Koizumi, who insisted on `doing the right thing, '" said Taiwan
Society North Vice President Michelle Wang, who spoke on behalf of the
coalition.</P>
      <P>What the coalition feels is the "right thing" for Hsieh to do, Wang explained,
is to make Taiwan a normal country, a topic Hsieh has been reluctant to
elaborate on.</P>
      <P>The content of the action plan is little different to the DPP's "normal country"
resolution, which includes the basic objectives of changing the country's name,
writing a new constitution, establishing a normal country and joining the United
Nations, she said, although she claimed it is the "voice of the people."</P>
      <P>The DPP election ticket "symbolizes the successful integration of the DPP's
internal factions, but we have not seen anything from the DPP that can touch the
voters, " claimed Hsu Yung-ming, a research fellow at Academia Sinica and a
Taiwan Society North member.</P>
      <P>"Supporters are still confused at Hsieh's positioning of the country because he
has never made it clear to the public. It's also hard to fathom why the normal
country resolution is still an issue without consensus within the DPP, "
according to Allen Houng, chairman of the Constitution Reform Alliance.</P>
      <P>A responsible political party is supposed to submit its party platform and the
blueprint for the country before a major election, said Tsai Ting-kuei, chairman
of the Taiwan Association of University Professors (TAUP). Tsai noted that the
coalition does not endorse any candidate in the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>"We would like to see `vision, mission and action' from presidential candidates.
An election is like an agreement between the candidates and the voters. Any
change of position after the election would be a breach of contract, " said
William Lo, a pastor of Taiwan's Presbyterian Church.</P>
      <P>Once the resolution makes it through the DPP Central Executive Committee, it is
scheduled to be presented to the party congress this autumn for final approval.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian stayed on his chartered plane during a refueling stop
at Anchorage International Airport in Alaska Tuesday en route to Central America
for a three-nation diplomatic tour.</P>
      <P>American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Honorary Chairman William Brown and Alaska
Deputy Governor Sean Panell went aboard Chen's plane to welcome him, but the
president did not disembark throughout the 50-minute refueling stopover.</P>
      <P>Lee Nan-yang, director of the Public Affairs Office of the Presidential Office
and a member of Chen's entourage, claimed that the president stayed on the plane
out of "safety considerations, " saying that personnel movement aboard the plane
during refueling "could cause security concerns."</P>
      <P>Another reason was that the plane could not stay too long in Alaska as the
government of Honduras -- the first leg of Chen's trip, has scheduled a military
welcoming ceremony for Chen.</P>
      <P>However, lawmakers of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) who are
accompanying Chen on the trip claimed that Chen's decision not to disembark was
a gesture to protest U.S. government restrictions on his transit stop.</P>
      <P>The U.S. government has reportedly rejected Chen's request for layovers in major
U.S. cities other than Anchorage or staying overnight during the transit stops
as a way of expressing its displeasure with his administration's plan to push
for a referendum on whether to apply to join the United Nations under the name
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Tang Pi-o said seats on Chen's chartered plane all have a sticker
attached calling for support for Taiwan's U.N. bid. Tang said she and two other
members of Chen's entourage -- DPP Legislator Hsieh Hsin-ni and Government
Information Office Minister Shieh Jhy-wey -- also have the stickers attached to
their clothes. "I'm convinced that the U.S. representatives have clearly seen
our appeal," she added.</P>
      <P>Following the brief stopover in Alaska, Chen and his entourage head for Honduras
where he will attend the sixth leadership summit between Taiwan and its Central
American diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>The national leaders who are expected to take part in the summit include
Belizean Prime Minister Said Musa, Guatemalan President Oscar Berger, Salvadoran
President Antonio Saca, Honduran President Manuel Zelaya,  Panamanian President
Martin Torrijos,  Nicaraguan Vice President Jaime Morales and Dominican Republic
Vice President Rafael Alburquerque.</P>
      <P>Also during the president's visit in Honduras, the two countries will sign a
memorandum under which Taiwan will provide a US$5 million loan in support of the

    <HEADLINE>President regrets U.S. restrictions on his transit stop</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Anchorage,  Alaska,  Aug. 21 (CNA)
08/22/07  01:48:08
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday he regrets U.S. restrictions on his
transit stop on his way to Central America for a three-nation diplomatic tour,
saying that the U.S. treatment was "inconvenient, uncomfortable and indecent."</P>
      <P>Stressing that the proposal to hold a referendum on whether to apply to join the
United Nations under the name of Taiwan is backed by a majority of Taiwan
people, Chen said the U.S. restriction of his transit stop over this issue is
punishment of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen was quoted as having made the remarks while meeting American Institute in
Taiwan (AIT) Honorary Chairman William Brown aboard his chartered plane during a
refueling stop in Anchorage, Alaska en route to Honduras.</P>
      <P>The U.S. government has reportedly rejected Chen's request for layovers in major
U.S. cities other than Anchorage or staying overnight during the transit stops
as a way of expressing its displeasure with his administration's plan to push
for a referendum on the U.N. membership bid under the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Brown and Alaska Lieutenant Governor Sean Parnell went aboard Chen's plane to
welcome him, but the president did not disembark throughout the refueling stop.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General Chen Chi-mai, who is accompanying
the president on the trip, said President Chen had decided to stay on his plane
as a gesture to protest U.S. government restrictions on his transit stop prior
to his departure for the journey.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Chi-mai, President Chen held talks with Brown aboard the plane
for nearly 90 minutes.</P>
      <P>The president was quoted as having told Brown that Taiwan's ruling and
opposition parties possess a high degree of consensus on pursuing Taiwan's U.N.
membership under the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan treasures its longstanding friendship with the United States
and that transit stop is not the main purpose of his travel, Chen said he
personally ate the dirt and endured the insult. Nonetheless, Chen added that the
U.S. treatment is not punishment of him, but rather punishment of Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that pursuing a U.N. seat under the name of Taiwan neither violates
his "four noes" pledge nor change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, Chen
said the move is actually a way to safeguard Taiwan's democracy and the present
peaceful status quo in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>As the holding of referendums is a basic human right, Chen said Taiwan cannot
accept any "red line" imposed on its democracy.</P>
      <P>On resolving the Taiwan-U.S. dispute over the U.N. referendum issue, Chen
suggested that the two sides communicate by phone or the U.S. government send a
delegation composed of State Department or Pentagon officials to visit Taiwan
for direct dialogue on relevant topics.</P>
      <P>For his part, Brown was quoted as having told Chen that the U.S. government has
no intention of making him uncomfortable during his transit stop. He also
promised to convey Chen's opinions and suggestions to pertinent U.S.
authorities.</P>
      <P>AIT is a quasi-official U.S. organization authorized to handle relations with
Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Following their brief stopover in Anchorage, Chen and his entourage head for
Honduras where he will attend the sixth leadership summit between Taiwan and its
Central American diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>Also during his visit in Honduras, the two countries will sign a memorandum
under which Taiwan will provide a US$5 million loan in support of the Central
American country's national computerization project.</P>
      <P>On Aug. 24, Chen will head to El Salvador for a three-day visit before traveling
on to Nicaragua Aug. 26.</P>
      <P>The president is set to conclude his trip Aug. 28 and head home via Alaska. He
is scheduled to arrive in Taipei Aug. 29.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH, COA agree to retain ban on animal drug</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  21 (CNA)
08/22/07  10:31:41
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) and the Council of Agriculture (COA) agreed
Tuesday to retain a ban on ractopamine -- an animal drug to promote the growth
of lean meat in livestock that is banned in Taiwan but lawful in some countries
-- following protests by local pig farmers in front of the two agencies.</P>
      <P>DOH Minister Hou Sheng-mou signed a pledge agreeing to retain the ban on the
animal drug and promising that the DOH will not allow ractopamine-tainted
foreign imports to enter the county before the law is amended, and that it will
not unilaterally ease the ban but rather act in concert with the Council of
Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>Hou inked his name in the pledge after thousands of hog farmers demonstrated in
front of the DOH against a possible lifting of the ban by the government.</P>
      <P>Some 1,000 pig farmers from across the country later proceeded to the COA, where
Vice Minister Hu Fu-hsiung, witnessed by representatives from local hog-raising
associations and lawmakers, also made a pledge on behalf of COA Minister Su Jia-
chyuan, promising that the COA will maintain the ban on the veterinary drug.</P>
      <P>Farmers dropped their plan to protest in front of the Taipei office of the
American Institute in Taiwan after obtaining assurances from the DOH and the
COA.</P>
      <P>Pan Lien-chou, chairman of the national pig-farming association, told a news
conference at the Legislative Yuan later the same day that all livestock farmers
across the country will take to the streets again if the government is found to
permit foreign imports with ractopamine residue to enter the local market.</P>
      <P>Angry hog farmers from central and southern regions got together in Taipei to
protest a possible relaxation of the ban on ractopamine by the government after
two shipments of U.S. pork imports were found to contain the substance last
month. A limited use of the animal drug is lawful in the United States and
Japan, while it is banned in more than 160 countries.</P>

      <P>Council of Agriculture (COA) Chairman Su Jia-chyuan promised Tuesday to offer

suffered heavy losses when Typhoon Sepat devastated their orchards.</P>
      <P>Su made the announcement while accompanying  Premier Chang Chun-hsiung on an
inspection tour of the worst-affected areas.</P>
      <P>A subsidy of NT$50,000 (US$1,516) per hectare will be paid to farmers who have
lost more than 40 percent of their pomelos as a result of the typhoon, a COA
official said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the COA will provide a subsidy of NT$3 per kilogram for fallen
pomelos to the counties' township offices and agricultural associations, which
will purchase the fallen fruit for processing, the official said.</P>
      <P>Pomelo farmers in the two counties suffered combined losses of NT$160 million,

    <HEADLINE>Pro-independence groups urge DPP candidate to elucidate stance</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 21 (CNA)
08/22/07  10:36:45
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank Hsieh
should "do the right thing in making himself clear on the position and prospects
of the country," a coalition of pro-Taiwan independence groups said Tuesday at a
press conference.</P>
      <P>The coalition also submitted its own action plan for Taiwan's normalization as a
country Tuesday before the DPP Central Executive Committee begins to screen a
"normal country" resolution this week. It calls for Hsieh to make his position
clear to voters on the resolution.</P>
      <P>"A great statesman should follow the example of former Japanese Prime Minister
Junichiro Koizumi, who insisted on `doing the right thing, '" said Taiwan
Society North Vice President Michelle Wang, who spoke on behalf of the
coalition.</P>
      <P>What the coalition feels is the "right thing" for Hsieh to do, Wang explained,
is to make Taiwan a normal country, a topic Hsieh has been reluctant to
elaborate on.</P>
      <P>The content of the action plan is little different to the DPP's "normal country"
resolution, which includes the basic objectives of changing the country's name,
writing a new constitution, establishing a normal country and joining the United
Nations, she said, although she claimed it is the "voice of the people."</P>
      <P>The DPP election ticket "symbolizes the successful integration of the DPP's
internal factions, but we have not seen anything from the DPP that can touch the
voters, " claimed Hsu Yung-ming, a research fellow at Academia Sinica and a
Taiwan Society North member.</P>
      <P>"Supporters are still confused at Hsieh's positioning of the country because he
has never made it clear to the public. It's also hard to fathom why the normal
country resolution is still an issue without consensus within the DPP, "
according to Allen Houng, chairman of the Constitution Reform Alliance.</P>
      <P>A responsible political party is supposed to submit its party platform and the
blueprint for the country before a major election, said Tsai Ting-kuei, chairman
of the Taiwan Association of University Professors (TAUP). Tsai noted that the
coalition does not endorse any candidate in the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>"We would like to see `vision, mission and action' from presidential candidates.
An election is like an agreement between the candidates and the voters. Any
change of position after the election would be a breach of contract, " said
William Lo, a pastor of Taiwan's Presbyterian Church.</P>
      <P>Once the resolution makes it through the DPP Central Executive Committee, it is
scheduled to be presented to the party congress this autumn for final approval.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several cases of pertussis, or whooping cough, were reported recently in a
religious community in Changhua County, a Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>A total of three adults and three children were diagnosed with pertussis in the
community earlier this month, according to CDC Deputy Director-General Chou
Chih-hao.</P>
      <P>The community, affiliated with a local religious association, is comprised of 32
residents, including 14 people from four different families, 12 single volunteer
workers and six physically or mentally challenged members who are being
sheltered there.</P>
      <P>The first two cases -- two infants from different families -- were discovered
Aug. 8, Chou said.</P>
      <P>After tests on the rest of the residents, a five-year-old boy, three adults were
confirmed to have also been infected, he said, adding that the patients are
recovering after being treated with antibiotics.</P>
      <P>According to Chou, while infants in the country are given four doses of
pertussis vaccine, at the age of two months, four months, six months and 18
months, respectively, the infected five-year-old boy had only received the first
three doses, while the two infected infants had not received any doses.</P>
      <P>According to the CDC, pertussis may start with cold symptoms before developing
into episodes of severe coughing, which could lead to vomiting.</P>
      <P>However, infants with pertussis may not develop a severe cough and may only have
a mild cough and decreased appetite and may have difficulty breathing or turn
bluish, CDC officials said.</P>
      <P>Chou said that although about 95 percent of children in the country have
received pertussis vaccination, sporadic infections are reported every year.</P>
      <P>He advised parents to make sure their children receive the vaccination according
to schedule and urged caregivers of children to wear masks if any members of the
family display symptoms of pertussis, such as coughing or difficulty breathing.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Gambling &amp; Entertainment Summit 2007 is scheduled to be held in
Taipei City Aug. 27 with the aim of examining the prospects of Taiwan becoming
another gambling mecca after Las Vegas, Macau and Singapore.</P>
      <P>Stuart Mann, dean of the William F. Harrah College of Hotel Administration under
the University of Nevada,  Las Vegas, is scheduled to deliver a keynote speech
during the opening session, according to Liao Chao-hung, director of the Taipei-
based Asia Management Research Center (AMRC).</P>
      <P>The summit,  the first of its kind in Taiwan,  is being co-sponsored by the
Taiwan Office of the State of Nevada, the Chinese Culture University and the
AMRC.</P>
      <P>Liao said that Macau and Singapore had attracted international funds and applied
international casino management systems to develop their gambling and
entertainment  industries,  but the key to maintaining sustainable operations
will be whether they are able to cultivate their own high-caliber management
talent.</P>
      <P>Liao estimated that if casinos are legalized in Taiwan, the new industry will
create at least 50,000 jobs.</P>
      <P>An official from the Nevada State Taiwan Office said that the four premier
casino-hotels in Las Vegas have decided to invest some US$33 billion in Asia to
expand their gambling and entertainment operations in this part of the world.</P>
      <P>After exploring the Macau and Singapore markets, executives of the Las Vegas
hotels will also attend the Taiwan Gambling &amp; Entertainment Summit in Taipei
to gain a better understanding of the country's potential in developing a casino
gaming industry, the official said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>City government takes over management of Taipei Arena in sudden move</HEADLINE>

      <P>Over 100 Taipei City officials and police officers entered the Taipei Arena
Wednesday in a sudden move by the municipal government to take over management
of the city's first multifunctional indoor stadium.</P>
      <P>The action was launched by the Taipei City government without any notice being
given to the dome-shaped facility's contracted operator, the Eastern Dome
Management Company (EDMC), which is a subsidiary of the Eastern Multimedia Group
(EMG).</P>
      <P>According to the city government, the move was made "to protect the property of
the government and citizens."</P>
      <P>Yang Hsi-an,  deputy secretary-general  of the Taipei City government, quoted
Mayor Hau Lung-bin as saying that the city government will take charge of the
arena's operations for one year.</P>
      <P>Yang also stressed that the business operations of stores and the ice rink at
the arena will not be affected.</P>
      <P>The city government's move, however, triggered a strong protest from EDMC
Chairwoman Chiu Pei-lin who questioned the legal basis of the city government's
move.</P>
      <P>Hau announced Aug. 14 the city government's decision to terminate its nine-year
contract with the EMG to manage the Taipei Arena, after public prosecutors
indicted EMG Chairman Gary Wang on charges of committing a series of financial
crimes, including using collusive bidding to obtain the right to manage the
facility.</P>
      <P>EMG won the right to manage the Taipei Arena for nine years with a bid of
NT$1.58 billion (US$47.78 million) in 2005 when Ma Ying-jeou was Taipei mayor.</P>
      <P>Taipei prosecutors  have unearthed  evidence that Wang and Hsieh Yin-lung, an
EDMC deputy manager, engaged in bidding collusion to allow Wang to obtain the
concession right.</P>
      <P>According to the prosecutors, Wang and Hsieh each formed a new company
specifically for the bidding, but Wang later paid Hsieh NT$24.78 million in
return for his promise that his bid would not go higher than Wang's -- an act in
violation of the Government Procurement Law.</P>
      <P>Wang and 31 of his associates were indicted Aug. 13 for their alleged
involvement in several embezzlement scandals. Prosecutors are seeking a 28-year
prison sentence for Wang, plus a fine of NT$1 billion.</P>

      <P>Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng called Wednesday for travel agents and
other members of the tourism industry operating on the outlying island of Kinmen
to make greater efforts to help Kinmen gain a larger slice of the cross-Taiwan
Strait "tourism pie."</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of a tourism training workshop, Lee called for Kinmen-
based travel agencies and related tourism operators to upgrade their service
quality so they can attract more tourists from mainland China to make
sightseeing trips to Kinmen.</P>
      <P>A total of 202 people representing travel agencies, hotels, restaurants, shops
and bus companies around Kinmen took part in the training workshop sponsored by
the Kinmen County Government.</P>
      <P>Lee quoted tallies from the Kinmen County Bureau of Tourism as indicating that
Kinmen has attracted over 43,000 Chinese tourists since China began allowing
residents of Fujian Province to make sightseeing trips to Kinmen in December
2004.</P>
      <P>According to the tallies, Lee said, 64 people in four travel groups from Fujian
visited Kinmen for tourism in 2004, with the figures increasing to 3,129 people
in 170 groups in 2005 and 20,067 people in 1,040 groups in 2006.</P>
      <P>So far this year, over 20,000 Fujian tourists in 853 groups have visited Kinmen,
he added.</P>
      <P>Also addressing the workshop, opposition Kuomintang Legislator Wu Cherng-dean
said that there is no reason why Kinmen -- with a cultural history of over 1,600
years, an interesting contemporary history filled with major battles, and an
ideal geographical position between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan -- cannot
become a major tourism destination.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet finalized Wednesday a plan to reform the country's estate and gift
taxation system that will lower the maximum rates for the two categories of
taxes from 50 percent at present to 40 percent.</P>
      <P>Also, the exemption for estate tax will be increased from NT$7.79 million
(US$236,778) at present to NT$10 million, and the exemption will be applicable
to parents who give their properties to their children during their lifetime,
according to the plan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the minimum taxable amount for the two categories of taxes will be
raised significantly from NT$600,000 to NT$5 million, with the number of tax
rate classifications simplified from 10 to five -- 6 percent, 13 percent, 21
percent, 30 percent and 40 percent.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said the new system may be implemented early next year
at the earliest.</P>
      <P>In the next step, the Cabinet will further work to integrate the estate tax and
gift tax by 2010, adopting a lifetime wealth transfer taxation system and
further reducing the maximum tax rate to 20 percent, Chang said, adding that he
believes the reforms will help establish a sound taxation system to boost the
country's economic development and improve the people's well-being.</P>

      <P>A five-member U.S. group, including three aviation officials, arrived in Okinawa
Wednesday to help investigate why a Boeing 737-800 of Taiwan-based China
Airlines (CAL) burst into flames minutes after landing at Okinawa's Naha
international airport Monday.</P>
      <P>The three officials from the National Transportation Safety Board and the
Federal Aviation Administration, arrived along with two experts from Boeing Co.
and are expected to meet with officials from Japan's Ministry of Land,
Infrastructure and Transportation (MLIT) at Naha Airport to probe the cause of
the fire.</P>
      <P>The Boeing 737-800 passenger jet from Taipei caught fire shortly after landing
at Naha Airport, but all 157 passengers and eight crew members aboard the plane
managed to escape before the left engine exploded and engulfed the plane in a
fireball.</P>
      <P>According to preliminary  investigations  conducted by MLIT experts, the fire
was probably caused by a problem with the fuel pipe in the plane's right wing,
which caught fire when it came into contact with the hot engine.</P>
      <P>The pipe is inside the plane's "pylon, " a tube that connects the engine with
the wing and brings in fuel.</P>
      <P>Investigators from the Japanese inquiry committee and CAL have been examining
the destroyed aircraft since Tuesday to try to determine the cause of the
accident.</P>

      <P>The Taipei city government's sudden move Wednesday to take over the Taipei
Arena's management was to prevent the city-owned  stadium's  contracted
operator  from filing a provisional disposition lawsuit in an attempt to
"occupy" the Taipei City property, according to a high-ranking city official.</P>
      <P>City Deputy Secretary-General Yang Hsi-an made the statement at a press
conference at the dome-shaped facility, the capital's first multifunctional
indoor stadium, soon after the move that incurred strong protest by the Eastern
Dome Management Company (EDMC) , which was formed by the Eastern Multimedia
Group (EMG) to manage the Taipei Arena.</P>
      <P>In a news release, the city government said it requested that EDMC return the
arena management Aug. 17 in accordance with a bilateral contract, as well as the
regulations governing contracted management of city properties.</P>
      <P>However, not only did EDMC not respect the request, the company, which has not
paid any royalties since July, took legal action Monday to confirm its right to
manage the dome.</P>
      <P>This action revealed EDMC's "attempt to occupy the facility through holding off
the city government's move to take it over, " according to the news release.</P>
      <P>Yang said the city government has hoped for the takeover to be conducted in a
peaceful manner through negotiations and mutual communication since Mayor Hau
Lung-bin announced his administration's decision Aug. 14 to terminate its nine-
year contract with EDMC.</P>
      <P>The decision was made after public prosecutors indicted EMG Chairman Gary Wang
on charges of committing a series of financial crimes, including using collusive
bidding to obtain the right to manage the arena in violation of the Government
Procurement Law, according to the Taipei city government.</P>
      <P>The compulsory takeover took effect at 7: 30 a.m. Wednesday, with EDMC employees
unable to enter or leave the dome without the city government's permission, Yeh
Ching-yuan, director of the city's Law and Regulation Commission, said,
reiterating the city government's right to terminate the contract with EDMC
since the way the company gained the dome's management right is considered
"unjust."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in response to media inquiries at the Taipei Arena, EDMC General
Manager Lin Ker-mo accused the city government of "using its administrative
power to deal with a civil contract dispute"</P>
      <P>Lin called the morning takeover a "break-in."</P>
      <P>Over 100 city officials and policemen entered the Taipei Arena, with most EDMC
employees shut outside. EDMC Chairwoman Chiu Pei-lin, accompanied by a lawyer,
questioned the legal basis of the move, arguing that the city government has no
right to "unilaterally terminate the contract while acting to avoid a lawsuit."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reiterated his stance during a recent media interview
that Taiwan is already an independent  sovereign  country  and  has no need  to
declare independence, according to the transcript of the interview released
Wednesday by the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>In the interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Chen noted
that Taiwan's sovereignty does not fall under the jurisdiction of the People's
Republic of China and that there is "one country on each side of the Taiwan
Strait."</P>
      <P>"Taiwan being a sovereign independent country has been the reality for more than
half a century and is still the status quo today, " Chen said, rejecting
criticism that Taiwan will provoke Beijing and trigger a war across the Taiwan
Strait by making such a claim.</P>
      <P>Although almost every step taken by Taiwan to further its democracy  is
considered  by China as moves toward  "de jure independence, " the country must
carry on with its course, whether China likes it or not, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that China has over the decades refused to acknowledge Taiwan's
status as a sovereign independent country and is harboring the motive of
annexing Taiwan and turning it into another Hong Kong or Macau by imposing the
"one country, two systems" model.</P>
      <P>"But this is unacceptable to our people and there is no way we can sit and wait
for our enemies to take us over," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen said it is important for Taiwan to continue consolidating its democracy
"because in democracy lies our most effective `theater missile  defense'
against  China"  and making efforts  toward establishing Taiwan as a "normal
country enjoying the same rights as other countries."</P>
      <P>In this sense, he said, Taiwan "has the full right" to participate in the
international community and world organizations, including the World Health
Organization (WHO) and the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Despite the country's failure to become a full member of the WHO under the name
of Taiwan this year, it will keep pressing forward with the goal and will also
be applying for full membership in the United Nations using a similar format, he
said.</P>
      <P>"We want to make sure that one day, the voice of our people will be heard in all
corners of the world, if not today, then maybe tomorrow, " Chen said. "However
long it takes, we will continue striving until we become a normal country that
is accepted by international society."</P>
      <P>On concerns that Taiwan's efforts to become a "normal country" could provoke a
military attack from China, Chen said it is the "collective will" of the Taiwan
people that speaks and that Taiwan "will not keep silent just because China
doesn't like what it hears."</P>
      <P>Citing results of an opinion survey conducted in March this year, the president
said that 95 percent of the people support the country's application for WHO
membership and that 77 percent support the application for U.N. membership under
the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked if he is confident that the United States will defend Taiwan in the event
of an attack from China, Chen said he believes the United States will fulfill
its obligations as stipulated in the Taiwan Relations Act and come to Taiwan's
aid "as long as Taiwan is not the one inciting a military conflict."</P>
      <P>However, Chen added that Taiwan cannot rely on others to fight for the country
and must work to beef up its defense capabilities, without the intention of
engaging in an arms race with China.</P>
      <P>"We do not seek to engage in war. But we must be prepared for war if we wish to
prevent it and work towards achieving lasting peace, " he said.</P>

      <P>Honduran President Jose Manuel Zela Rosales vowed Tuesday to support Taiwan's
accession to the United Nations, saying that all nations around the world are
equal and that Taiwan deserves to be a full U.N. member.</P>
      <P>Zela said that Honduras and Taiwan share common values of freedom, democracy and
human rights.</P>
      <P>The Honduran president made the remarks at a ceremony held at the Palmerola
military airport, where he presided over a military salute to welcome the
arrival of President Chen Shui-bian for a three-day state visit.</P>
      <P>Soon after the red-carpet welcome ceremony, Chen, accompanied by Honduran Vice
President Elvin Santos, was driven to the city of Tabacalera, where a Taiwan
agricultural mission is located, to inspect the agricultural achievements that
Honduran farmers have made with the assistance of the Taiwan mission.</P>
      <P>Chen and Santos visited a local farm growing Taiwanese guava and was treated
with guava and corn cake by the farm's owner.</P>
      <P>Chen met with Zela again in the evening at the Honduran Presidential  Palace for
mutual talks before signing  a joint communique calling for cooperation between
the two countries on 11 projects, including the Taiwan Power Company extending
assistance to Honduras for the development of a hydraulic power plant, Taiwan
helping Honduras develop tourism and Taiwan helping Honduras improve community
medical services.</P>
      <P>Later in the evening, the two heads of state witnessed the signing of an
agreement on mutual exemption of diplomatic and official visas between the two
countries. The agreement was inked by Republic of China Foreign Minister James
Huang and his Honduran counterpart, Milton Jimenez.</P>
      <P>Chen was scheduled to witness the signing of a memorandum Wednesday afternoon
under which Taiwan will provide a US$5 million loan in support of the Central
American  country's  national computerization project.</P>
      <P>He is also scheduled to be conferred with a citation by Zela Wednesday before
delivering a speech and visiting a national museum.</P>
      <P>Chen and his entourage arrived in the Honduran capital via the U.S. city of
Anchorage, where they made a brief refueling stopover. The president is
scheduled to head from Honduras to El Salvador Aug. 24 for another three-day
visit before traveling on to Nicaragua Aug. 26. He is set to conclude his
Central American trip Aug. 28 and head home via Alaska, arriving in Taipei Aug.

      <P>The government has launched a fiber broadband building (FBB) label certification
system to promote the new technology in an effort to boost the country's optical
fiber communication industry, market sources said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>A certificate presentation ceremony was held a day earlier to recognize
construction enterprises using the services and encourage more to join, with
scores of representatives from 23 construction companies participating.</P>
      <P>The ceremony was organized by the Industrial Development Bureau under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), the MOEA Committee of Communications
Industry Development, the Institute for Information Industry,  the Taiwan
Electrical  And Electronic  Manufacturers Association and the Communications
Industry Alliance (CIA).</P>
      <P>There are two types of FBB labels -- fiber to the home gold label and fiber to
the building silver label, according to CIA Chairman Wen Pu-san, who is in
charge of the campaign.</P>
      <P>Wen said since the launch of the system in April, system organizers have
received 30 applications. He estimated by the end of this year, the number of
households using fiber-based broadband services in the country will have
increased to 500,000 and by 2010, the number of households using such services
will have broken 2.4 million, representing 40 percent of broadband household
subscribers.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics that show a total of 197 million households worldwide
subscribed to broadband services in 2006, IDB Deputy Director-General  Shen
Jong-chin  said the growth of broadband subscribers is relatively slow, as
broadband services are mainly based on ADSL technology, which is limited in the
transmission of data and is forecast to be unable to meet growing needs of users
and service providers in the future.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the optical fiber communication industry is highly promising, Shen
said, adding that the IDB has commissioned the CIA to organize a series of fiber
technology promotional activities, including the FBB label campaign, with the
goal of pushing development of the industry.</P>

      <P>A would-be nominee for the chief of the Judicial  Yuan  has asked  to have his
name  withdrawn  from consideration, Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
confirmed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang said that Yang Jen-shou, president of the Commission on the Disciplinary
Sanctions of Functionaries, asked him to relay his refusal to be nominated to
President Chen Shui-bian after a scholar questioned the constitutionality of
Yang's nomination.</P>
      <P>Wang said, however, that he had no chance to pass on Yang's request because Chen
departed for a Central America trip Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The United Daily News said Wednesday Yang decided to withdraw from the
nomination to pre-empt any controversy. He could not be reached for comment on
the report.</P>
      <P>Chen's aides made it known Aug. 17 that the president would name Yang to replace
Weng Yueh-sheng as president of the Judicial Yuan, as the latter's term falls
due at the end of September.</P>
      <P>The nomination would have been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for approval
after the president returns from his Central America trip later this month,
according to Chen's aides.</P>
      <P>This news has drawn criticism from Yen Chu-an, a law professor at National
Taiwan University, who questioned the constitutionality of the choice of Yang as
the judiciary chief.</P>
      <P>Noting that Yang served as a grand justice between 2003 and 2006 before he was
appointed to his current post, Yen said Yang is not qualified to serve as chief
of the Judicial Yuan -- who is an automatic grand justice -- because the
Constitution limits grand justices to only one term.</P>
      <P>Yen claimed that if Yang is nominated simply because he has terminated his first
term as grand justice to serve in another post, it would look like a legal trick
to get around the constitutional limitation and would not serve the interests of
the nation.</P>

      <P>Taiwan should make greater use of the World Trade Organization (WTO) framework
to get global market access rather than trying to sign free trade pacts with
other countries, which is difficult thanks to political factors, Taiwan
Representative to the WTO Lin Yi-fu said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks while giving a speech at a seminar on investment in the
global market organized by the Chinese National Association of Industry and
Commerce and the Foreign Service Institute under the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs.</P>
      <P>Tariff duties are lower among WTO members, so some of them levy anti-dumping and
countervailing duties on imports in order to protect their domestic industries,
Lin said.</P>
      <P>Because it has the third-highest of cases of anti-dumping duties among WTO
members, Taiwan should participate more actively in negotiations  with WTO
members to prevent their imposition of anti-dumping and countervailing measures
against Taiwan products, Lin went on.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lin said, Taiwan should slow down its liberalization of
agricultural trade to avoid negative impact on Taiwan's economy, as the
competitiveness of Taiwan's agriculture sector is relatively weak compared to
other WTO members.</P>
      <P>Taiwan already has a quite open market in service trade and can further expand
its international market in certain areas such as telecommunications,
distribution, financial services and professional services through negotiation,
he said.</P>
      <P>In terms of Taiwan's strong points such as bicycle and hand tool manufacturing,
Lin said Taiwan can consider market liberalization or removing tariff duties.</P>

      <P>Taiwan, like other World Trade Organization (WTO) members, should understand how
to take advantage of appropriate regulations under the WTO framework in the
event of trade disputes relating to environmental issues, a Japanese academic
said in an international conference held in Taipei Wednesday.</P>
      <P>There will always be trade disputes relating to food safety and environmental
issues and there is limit to what the dispute settlement procedure can do,
Mitsuo Matsushita, a law professor at Japan's Seikei University and a former
member of the WTO's Appellate Body,  said in the conference  titled "Global
Governance  of Multilateral Environmental and Trading Systems."</P>
      <P>There have been over 200 multilateral environmental agreements signed all over
the world, including the Kyoto Protocol, aimed at protecting the environment.
Some of them use a quota system, such as the International Convention for the
Conservation of Atlantic Tuna, while others are supposed to resolve the problems
within a trading system, such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Basel Convention,
Matsushita said.</P>
      <P>However, disputes continue to happen, he went on, citing the latest dispute
between Brazil and the European Commission over retreaded tires.</P>
      <P>Potential conflicts between Kyoto Protocol, Cartagena Protocol (which regulates
biosafety) and WTO rules are possible, which is why countries are encouraged to
work out different ways to resolve the problems, Matsushita said.</P>
      <P>"Global governance is needed to solve disputes such as terrorism and trade
issues because we can't do it unilaterally, " Economic Vice Minister Hsieh Fadah
said, adding that regional, transnational and international networks are needed
to deal with environmental issues.</P>
      <P>Any trade restriction implementation has to consider the factors of economical
gains, social welfare and environmental impact, Hsieh noted.</P>
      <P>The two-day conference was organized by the Chunghua Institution for Economic
Research and invited scholars from Japan, South Korea, the U.S. and the WTO to

      <P>The number of abandoned children in Taiwan has grown rapidly, jumping by 40
percent over the past six years, according to the latest figures made public
Wednesday by the Child Welfare Foundation.</P>
      <P>In 2006, 509 children, including 35 newborns, were deserted by their birth
parents in Taiwan, up by more than 40 percent over the 2001 figure of 361,
according to the results of an investigation.</P>
      <P>At the same time, a larger number of families are putting their children up for
adoption, while fewer local families are willing to adopt, according to the
report.</P>
      <P>The number of telephones  calls by parents searching  for professional
consultations to have their children adopted increased by nearly 70 percent
during the six-year period, from 366 in 2001 to 619 in 2006, while the number of
adopted children dropped by 35 percent in a decade -- from 4,015 in 1996 to
2,626 in 2006.</P>
      <P>The report attributed the decreasing number of adopted children to a worsening
social environment, the rising cost of rearing children, progressive
fertilization techniques and a trend of having fewer children.</P>
      <P>In addition, the report pointed out, it is difficult to find foster families in
Taiwan for children with congenital illnesses or facial defects and for those
born to parents with alcohol or drug addiction.</P>
      <P>From 2004 to 2006, as high as 50 percent of children born to drug-addicted
parents and nearly 30 percent of children with congenital illnesses were not
adopted, it said, adding that some 10 percent of children with darker skin born
to migrant workers or foreign spouses were also unwanted.</P>
      <P>The foundation has launched a fund-raising campaign urging the public to make
monetary donations to help take care of abandoned children, setting its target
at NT$10 million.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's investment environment was ranked sixth among 50 major economies by the
U.S.-based Business Environment Risk Intelligence (BERI) market research firm in
its 2007 report.</P>
      <P>Taiwan scored 72 points in BERI's second report for the year, with its
investment climate ranking behind that of Switzerland, Singapore, the
Netherlands, Japan and Norway. Its ranking was third in Asia.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was classified in the 1A category -- a country with low risk for
investment -- as in previous reports.</P>
      <P>BERI evaluates a country's investment climate based on three major indicators --
business risk index, political risk index and currency exchange risk index.</P>
      <P>BERI researchers predicted that Taiwan's overall investment climate will improve
stably in the next one to five years.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's business risk was ranked third in the world, only behind Switzerland
and Singapore, and second in Asia, while its currency exchange risk was
classified as fifth in the world and third in Asia.</P>
      <P>BERI experts predicted that Taiwan's business risk will continue improving due
to the approval by its legislature in July of a budget for 10 development
projects and growing export demand. These factors will boost Taiwan's economic
growth and create more jobs, BERI researchers added.</P>
      <P>However, the island's political risk was ranked 15th in the world and third in
Asia due largely to the uncertainty caused by its upcoming legislative and
presidential elections, according to BERI researchers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government is slated to establish the country's first labor
museum in the southern port city, municipal Labor Bureau officials said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The museum will be constructed at a storehouse area owned by the state-run
Taiwan Sugar Corp. as part of the city government's efforts to promote one of
the central government's projects to "activate" idle land and office and factory
buildings owned by state-run enterprises around the country, according to the
officials.</P>
      <P>Since the end of World War II, the officials said, Kaohsiung has been developed
into the most important industrial city in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Various industries have boomed in the city, including export processing, ship
breaking, discarded metal processing, ship building, cement production, fuel
refining, steel manufacturing, tourism and consumer electronics, as well as
land, marine and air transport, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The city government of Kaohsiung-- which is Taiwan's largest industrial city --
proposed building the labor museum with a research center to showcase a large
variety of exhibits, including historical documents related to laborers, the
officials went on.</P>
      <P>Construction of the museum was originally the brainchild of former Kaohsiung
Mayor Frank Hsieh, who is now ruling Democratic Progressive Party's candidate
for the 2008 presidential election. Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu included the idea
as part of her platform in her bid to run in the Kaohsiung mayoral election that
took place last December.</P>
      <P>The construction budget for the museum, scheduled to open at the end of 2009,
totals NT$100 million (US$3.03 million), the officials added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung ordered party officials
Wednesday to organize a party meeting in southern Taiwan to explain two key
issues concerning the people's livelihoods to local residents.</P>
      <P>Wu's  remarks  were  quoted  by  members  of the  party's decision-making
Central Standing Committee (CSC) , which held its weekly meeting earlier the
same day.</P>
      <P>According to the CSC sources, Wu issued the order on a proposal by KMT lawmaker
Ho Tsai-feng, also a CSC member, who urged the party to hold the weekly CSC
meeting in southern Taiwan to explain the party's efforts in approving the
government's NT$80 billion budget for a flood control program and its stance on
granting stipends for elderly farmers.</P>
      <P>Wu also expressed his hope of inviting Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng,
also a KMT member, to chair the meeting, tentatively slated to be held within
two weeks, at a time when southern regions are recovering from serious flooding
caused by Typhoon Sepat, which crossed Taiwan last Saturday, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Hou suggested that the party central should hold the CSC meeting in southern
Taiwan, claiming that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party has been seeking
to "pass the buck" for the disaster to the KMT by accusing that the NT$80
billion budget for flood prevention projects was delayed by the KMT at the
Legislative Yuan, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Hou also suggested inviting Wang to preside over the planned meeting to explain
to the public how the KMT screened the budget, they added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former National Palace Museum Director Shih Shou-chien and 14 others were
indicted Wednesday on charges of corruption in connection with the prestigious
museum's recently completed renovation and expansion project.</P>
      <P>Shih was head of the museum in suburban Taipei in 2004 when a contractor
allegedly received a major portion of the renovation and expansion work without
fully competing in the bidding process.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors suggested in the indictment that Shih be given a 15-year prison term
for his alleged role in the profiteering case.</P>
      <P>Also indicted was Hsieh Fei-yuan, a museum advisor for whom prosecutors
suggested an 18-year sentence. Meanwhile, prosecutors sought a 15-year prison
term for Luo Hsing-hua, the architect who won the main part of the expansion
contract.</P>
      <P>The others indicted include lower-ranking museum officials and subcontractors,
prosecutors said.</P>
      <P>According to the indictment, the accused allegedly passed favors and possibly
got kickbacks for awarding the work to the main contractor.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said the project's bidding process is suspected of having violated
the Government Procurement Law by allowing the winning bidder of a NT$2.5
million initial planning contract to secure a follow-up NT$13.3 million design,
supervision and service contract.</P>
      <P>At issue was the NT$385 million museum renovation project that got underway in
July 2004 and was not fully completed until late last year.</P>
      <P>Suspecting possible irregularities in the bidding process after repeated cost
overruns, the prosecutors launched massive raids on the offices and residences
of architect Luo Hsing-hua  and other contractors in late May, collecting a
large number of files and documents.</P>
      <P>A number of former and incumbent museum officials and former Public Construction
Commission (PCC)  officials have also been arraigned over the case. Among them
is Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng, who served as the museum's director
from 2000 through 2004. Tu was released after being quizzed by prosecutors
earlier this month.</P>
      <P>In February this year, the 42-year-old museum, which houses the best of the
1,000-year-old art collection of China's emperors, celebrated the reopening of
its full exhibition area after the renovation. The project added a new viewing
area for one of the world's largest collection of Chinese artifacts.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is set to finalize the draft of a
"normal country resolution" next week, a party official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The official made the remarks shortly after the party's Central Executive
Committee (CEC) held its first screening meeting on the draft version of the
resolution, which is set to form an important part of the party's platform for
the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>While most CEC members backed the party central's proposal to issue a "normal
country resolution" as part of the party's platform for the 2008 election, the
official said, some of them questioned the plausibility of certain parts of the
draft resolution.</P>
      <P>For instance,  Frank Hsieh,  the party's 2008 presidential candidate, said at
the meeting that superficial and empty slogans can no longer impress people in
this democratic era.</P>
      <P>"During the previous martial law era, advocacy of freedom and democracy can
easily move people. But the time has changed. Nowadays, everybody can publicly
air their views and political preferences, including appeals for nation building
or Taiwan independence, " Hsieh said, adding that he doesn't think that skin-
deep political slogans can sway people into the DPP's fold any more.</P>
      <P>In preparation for the coming election, Hsieh said, the DPP needs more soul
searching and brainstorming sessions to hammer out policy initiatives that can
effectively improve people's livelihoods. "Only by so doing can we win the
hearts and minds of the voters, " Hsieh added.</P>
      <P>It was decided  at Wednesday's  meeting  that the party's nine-member panel
responsible for drafting the "normal country resolution" will meet again Aug. 27
to revise certain provisions or wording, the party official said.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmakers and Central Executive Committee members will also be invited to
attend the meeting to present their views and opinions, the official said.</P>
      <P>"The panel is expected to come up with a new version that incorporates views
expressed by party bigwigs at the Aug. 27 meeting, " the official said, adding
that the version will then be presented for approval of President Chen Shui-bian
and Hsieh.</P>
      <P>As Chen will not return from a Central American tour until Aug. 29, the official
said, the party's Central Executive Committee will postpone its weekly meeting
from Aug. 29 to Aug. 30 to make a final confirmation of the "normal country
resolution, " which will then be presented to the party's national congress to
be held in September for endorsement.</P>

      <P>The U.S. government has arranged for President Chen Shui-bian's latest transit
stops in the United States according to its longstanding policy and practice, a
U.S. State Department official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The official said the United States has always demonstrated the utmost concern
for the people of Taiwan, rejecting Chen's criticism that the transit
arrangements are humiliating to the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Reportedly as a way of expressing its displeasure with the Chen administration's
push for a referendum on the country's U.N. membership bid under the name of
Taiwan, Washington has refused to allow Chen to stop over in major U.S. cities
other than Anchorage, Alaska for his latest visit to Central America. Washington
also reportedly refused to allow Chen to stay overnight during the transit
stops.</P>
      <P>During his brief transit stop in Anchorage Tuesday en route to Honduras -- the
first leg of his three-nation Central America visit, Chen opted to stay on his
chartered plane in what was seen as a gesture of protest against Washington's
restrictions regarding his transit stops.</P>
      <P>Speaking with American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)  Honorary Chairman William
Brown, who boarded Chen's plane to greet him, the president reportedly described
the treatment accorded to him as "inconvenient, uncomfortable and indecent,"
according to Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General Chen Chi-mai.</P>
      <P>Stressing the planned referendum is backed by a majority of the Taiwan people,
Chen reportedly told Brown that the U.S.</P>
      <P>restrictions concerning his transit stops are tantamount to punishment of the
people of Taiwan, according to Chen Chi-mai.</P>
      <P>The major purpose of Chen's Central America trip is to take part in the sixth
leadership summit between Taiwan and its diplomatic allies in the region to be
held in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa.</P>
      <P>The president will also visit El Salvador and Nicaragua before returning to
Taiwan Aug. 29.</P>

    <TEXT>Los Angeles TimesG After 51-day stall, Senate OKs budget.

California's 51-day budget impasse ended Tuesday when Senate Republicans who had
been blocking a spending plan gave up their fight, accepting largely symbolic
concessions on a few pet issues. The $145-billion budget they approved is nearly
identical to the bipartisan plan passed by the Assembly on July 20 and endorsed
by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. ]by Lu-sheng Chu^</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>Democracy should not be subject to any 'red lines': president</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that Taiwan's efforts to deepen its
democratic development, including a planned referendum on the country's U.N.
bid, should not be subject to any red lines or suppression.</P>
      <P>In particular, Taiwan's democracy should not be restricted just because China
opposes it, Chen said in the latest issue of his online newsletter.</P>
      <P>"Otherwise, we will send the wrong message to the dictators in Beijing that
China can have its way with its military might, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen was referring to the U.S. objection to Taiwan's plan to hold a referendum
on whether to apply to join the United Nations under the name "Taiwan" on the
grounds that it could increase tensions across the Taiwan Strait -- an issue
which has affected the arrangements of the president's plan to stop over in the
United States for his latest visit to Central America.</P>
      <P>Reportedly as a way of expressing its displeasure with the Chen administration's
push for the referendum despite U.S. objections, Washington has refused to allow
Chen to stop over in major U.S. cities other than Anchorage, Alaska or stay
overnight during the transit stops.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, because of the Taiwan-U.S. differences over the referendum
plan, he opted to "simplify" the transit arrangements by stopping only briefly
at Anchorage International Airport for refueling Tuesday without disembarking
the plane.</P>
      <P>"This has been an unprecedented experience for me in all of my foreign visits
during my terms as president," Chen said.</P>
      <P>"But for the sake of protecting Taiwan's national dignity and furthering the
country's democracy,  the courtesy, comfort and convenience for myself are of
little importance," he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan must insist on its quest because "the well-being and future of the Taiwan
people cannot be made bargaining chips or terms for any tradeoffs," the
president said.</P>
      <P>He  further  said  that  sticking  to  the  Taiwan-centric consciousness,
deepening Taiwan's democracy, and realizing social fairness and justice are
courses that the country must take toward becoming a "normal country."</P>
      <P>Despite the criticism and doubts over Taiwan's efforts to further its democratic
development, the country is not discouraged because as long as it stands on the
right side of history and on the side of the majority of the people,  it will
overcome any obstacles  and difficulties, Chen said.</P>
      <P>"We are convinced that a more democratic Taiwan will be more helpful to the
maintenance of long-lasting peace across the Taiwan Strait," he said.</P>

      <P>Chou Mei-li, a TSU publicity chief, said the U.S. toy giant Toys "R" Us removed

contained excessive level of lead.</P>
      <P>Some 160,000 bibs -- marketed under the Koala Baby,  the Especially for Baby and

Taiwan should at least give a public explanation about similar items that the
company has been selling in its Taiwan stores.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>El Salvador offered its endorsement Wednesday of a motion supporting Taiwan's
U.N. membership that was submitted to the world body last week, bringing to 16
the number of allies endorsing the motion, Taiwan officials posted in New York
said.</P>
      <P>The motion, which requests that the U.N. General Assembly press the Security
Council to deal with Taiwan's membership application according to established
procedures, was submitted Aug. 14 to the General Assembly, in the hope that the
motion can be included on the agenda of the 62nd regular session of the General
Assembly set to open Sept. 18 in New York.</P>
      <P>The General Committee is expected to meet Sept. 19 to finalize the agenda of the
session.</P>
      <P>The other 15 diplomatic allies of Taiwan that have endorsed the motion are
Belize, Burkina Faso, Gambia, Honduras, Kiribati, Malawi, the Marshall Islands,
Nauru, Palau, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Sao Tome
and Principe, the Solomon Islands, Swaziland, and Tuvalu.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China has tried without success to re-enter the United Nations
since 1993. This year marks the first time it has changed tactics by bidding to
join the world body under the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian sent a membership application letter on behalf of
Taiwan to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon July 19, but the letter was
returned by Ban based on U.N. Resolution 2758, which U.N. officials said is the
basis of the "one China" policy of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>On July 31, Chen sent a second letter to Ban urging him to reconsider his
decision and one to Wang Guangya, China's permanent representative to the United
Nations,  who served as rotating president of the Security Council for July.
Both letters were also returned.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has strongly protested Ban's move, claiming that only the Security
Council and the General Assembly have the authority to review and decide on
membership applications and that the U.N. Secretariat does not have the power to
decide on such matters.</P>
      <P>Also, Taiwan argued that Resolution 2758 neither grants China the right to
represent Taiwan at the United Nations nor states that Taiwan is either a part
of China or the People's Republic of China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian confirmed Wednesday that Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower)
will invest some NT$10 billion (US$303 million) to help build a hydraulic power
plant in Honduras, which is one of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Central
America.</P>
      <P>The proposed Patuca-3 Hydroelectric Project -- to be built on the Patuca River,
Honduras' longest and most important waterway -- is essential if the ever-
increasing demand for electricity in Honduras is to be met, Chen said, adding
that Taipower has committed to offering its help to have the project completed.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in a speech at the Honduran National Congress. During the
visit, the Honduran congressional speaker, Roberto Micheletti Bain, conferred
the Medal of Golden Cross on President Chen in recognition of his contribution
to cementing bilateral relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Chen said that based on the solid partnership that Taiwan shares
with Honduras, Taiwan is obligated to help Honduras reduce poverty and develop
infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he called for the Honduran Congress to pass the free trade agreement
(FTA) that Honduras has signed with Taiwan to enable the mutually beneficial
pact to come into force as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Chen joined Honduran President Jose Manuel Zela Rosales at a
middle school where they witnessed the signing of a memorandum under which
Taiwan will provide a US$5 million loan in support of a computerization project
to be implemented in middle schools and elementary schools across Honduras.</P>
      <P>Under the project, 3,000 computer centers will be built in Honduran schools over
three years. Over 1 million students are expected to benefit from the project.</P>
      <P>Addressing the memorandum-signing ceremony, Chen said he was told that the first
such computer center will be named the "Chen Shui-bian Classroom," adding that
he really does not deserve this. He said that he will suggest that the Honduran
school name the first computer center the "Taiwan classroom, " since the
contribution has been made by all the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen and his entourage arrived in the Honduran capital Tuesday for a three-day
state visit. The president is scheduled to head to El Salvador Aug. 24 for
another three-day visit before traveling on to Nicaragua Aug. 26.</P>

      <P>Fossil remains of a newborn mastodon were recently discovered in the dry
riverbed of Dajia River near Shih-kang village in Taichung County, sources at
the Taichung Mountainview Community University reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>They also noted that the discovery marks the first time that local
archaeologists have found proof that Taiwan was once home to the prehistoric
elephant species, which is estimated to have existed from about 28 million years
ago to 10,000 years ago.</P>
      <P>Mastodon fossils have been unearthed in the past in various areas in the
Northern Hemisphere, including in northern China, Europe, and North America.
However, they had never been found in Southeast Asia before the recent discovery
in Taichung County, which makes the discovery especially remarkable, according
to the university.</P>
      <P>The fossil teeth discovered have been verified as having belonged to a young
calf that lived in the neighboring areas sometime between 1.5 million and 1.8
million years ago.</P>
      <P>Archaeologists  at the university had previously discovered fossils of mammuthus
-- also a species of prehistoric elephant -- in the adjacent areas, proving for
the first time that this species existed in central Taiwan between 1.6 million
and 2.2 million years ago.</P>

provide the best showground facilities and transportation for participants in
shows at the venue. He said that exhibition booth rental fees will be at a
similar level as those of the Taipei World Trade Center Exhibition Hall, adding
that rental fees will be discounted during the opening period of the new venue.</P>
      <P>A variety of exhibitions are scheduled to be held at the venue next year,
including Taipei AMPA, Computex Taipei, Foodtech Taipei, Computex Taipei, Taipei

      <P>The Taiwan Toys "R" Us store has not sold any of the lead-contaminated toys that
have been pulled from store shelves in the United States, a corporate source
claimed Thursday.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan Toys "R" Us has a different outsourcing system from those of
the U.S.-based Toys "R" Us and Babies "R" Us, a Taiwan Toys "R" Us spokesman
said products lines carried in the company's outlets in Taiwan are thus
different from those found in stores in the United States.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  responding to a call by the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
to the administration Thursday to investigate the possibility of similar lead-
contaminated vinyl baby bibs from China that have been removed from Toys "R" Us
and Babies "R" Us across America having been displayed and sold in Taiwan Toys
"R" Us stores, the spokesman claimed that similar products have been imported by
the company and put on shelves only after passing tests and checks by relevant
government agencies here.</P>
      <P>The baby bibs that have been sold by Taiwan Toys "R" Us have also passed safety
checks by the British Intertek Laboratory,  the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Chou Mei-li, a TSU publicity chief, said earlier in the day that U.S. toy giant
Toys "R" Us removed all store-brand vinyl baby bibs from its shelves across the
United States Aug. 17 after tests confirmed that at least some of the Chinese-
made items contained excessive levels of lead.</P>
      <P>Chou said that some 160,000 bibs -- marketed under the Koala Baby, the
Especially for Baby and Kidcosmic labels -- were taken off the shelves across
America, adding that the management of Toys "R" Us Taiwan should at least give a
public explanation about similar items that the company is continuing to sell in
its Taiwan stores.</P>
      <P>Chou also called on the government to take the initiative in investigating baby
bibs sold in Toys "R" Us stores and other made-in-China toys and baby products
in other stores to see whether they pose a threat to children's health.</P>

      <P>The chairman of Taiwan-based China Airlines (CAL) said Wednesday that he has
offered to resign over the recent explosion of a CAL plane at Naha International
Airport on the Japanese island of Okinawa.</P>
      <P>Philip Wei, who is accompanying President Chen Shui-bian on a visit to the
Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, said he told the company's highest supervision
authority -- Minister of Transportation and Communications Tsai Duei --
immediately after learning of the mishap  that he would be prepared  to resign
to take token responsibility if required.</P>
      <P>A CAL Boeing 737-800 caught fire and exploded at the Okinawa airport Monday. All
passengers and crew members managed to escape alive before the plane exploded.</P>
      <P>Even before learning about the result of the accident, Wei said he had told Tsai
that he would be willing  to assume  full responsibility if the initial
investigations show that the blaze resulted from CAL's negligence or fault.</P>
      <P>Wei said he originally intended to cancel his travel plan with the president
after the fire, but changed his mind and decided to accompany Chen to Central
America after learning that there were no casualties.</P>
      <P>Wei said he had dispatched the company's general manager to Japan to handle
relevant affairs.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he was instructed to shoulder the responsibility for the accident,
Wei said that "no one asked me to leave." He said he is now waiting for the
result of a probe into the explosion, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in Taipei, Tsai said in response to media inquiries about his stance
on Wei's resignation offer that he will not deal with the matter until after
Wei's return.</P>
      <P>Tsai also serves as chairman of the Taipei-based China Aviation Development
Foundation, which is CAL's largest stockholder. Flight CI-120 burst into flames
shortly after landing in Naha Monday morning.</P>
      <P>The plane had just pulled up to the gate to disembark passengers when its left
engine caught fire and exploded. All 157 passengers, including 17 Japanese
citizens, 24 other foreign nationals and eight crew members managed to escape
before fire engulfed the entire plane. The cause of the fire is still under
investigation.</P>

      <P>An official of the Presidential Office has defended Taiwan's US$5 million loan
to its diplomatic ally Honduras as "humanitarian aid aimed at helping other
developing countries accelerate national development."</P>
      <P>Lee Nan-yang, director of the Presidential Office's Department of Public
Affairs, who is accompanying President Chen Shui-bian on a trip to three of the
country's allies in Central America, made the remarks after learning that
Taiwan's media had criticized the loan as "checkbook diplomacy."</P>
      <P>Lee said Honduran President Jose Manuel Zela Rosales has vowed to establish a
computer center in an effort to raise the Central American country's education
level and that Taiwan wants to provide the loan as humanitarian aid rather than
giving the money away.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of a survey, Lee said computer usage among the Honduran
public is a mere 3.7 percent, adding that only 19 percent of the faculty and
staff at primary and junior high schools in Honduras have access to computers
and that only 34 percent of the students have used the Internet.</P>
      <P>The loan plan is expected to benefit 3,000 schools in Honduras, 1,000 of which
will be equipped with Internet access, Lee went on.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan hopes to use its advanced technology to help other countries
bridge the digital divide, which Lee said is on the the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum meeting agenda this year.</P>
      <P>Speaking on a Taiwan Power Co. NT$10 billion (US$303 million) cooperation
project with Honduras for the development of a hydraulic power plant, Lee said
it is a build-operate-transfer (BOT) investment project and that the Honduran
government will need to pay off the loan over 39 years from its electricity
revenues.</P>
      <P>Lee said the government aims to help its Central American allies utilize
hydroelectric power to address their energy problems.</P>

      <P>Honduran President Jose Manuel Zela Rosales invited two Taiwanese high-
technology companies Wednesday to build manufacturing plants in Honduras, saying
that the two companies would be given plots of land free of charge on which to
build.</P>
      <P>Zela invited Taiwan-based High Tech Computer Corp. (HTC) -- a maker of mobile
phones with touch panels -- and Elitegroup -- a manufacturer of PCs and computer
peripherals -- to relocate part of their manufacturing operations to the Central
American country.</P>
      <P>According to Zela, visiting President Chen Shui-bian challenged him the night
before that if he could find two pieces of land for use by two Taiwanese
companies, Chen would in turn persuade two companies to invest in Honduras.</P>
      <P>Zela said he told Chen he had found two pieces of land and that he hoped HTC and
Elitegroup would respond his invitation by starting to think about investing in
Honduras.</P>
      <P>Zela made the remarks Wednesday after he joined Chen at a middle school where
they witnessed the signing of a memorandum under which Taiwan  will provide  a
US$5 million  loan in support  of a computerization project to be implemented in
middle schools and elementary schools across Honduras.</P>
      <P>Under the project, 3,000 computer centers will be built in Honduran schools over
three years. Over 1 million students are expected to benefit from the project.</P>
      <P>Welcoming Zela's offer, Chen Chi-mai, a deputy secretary-general of the
Presidential Office traveling with President Chen on the three-nation Central
American trip, said that if the two Taiwanese companies agree, the
administration will also offer incentives to them in accordance with a project
designed to encourage increased Taiwanese investment in diplomatic allies in
Latin America.</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-mai noted that as two-way trade between China and Honduras has
increased by leaps and bounds in recent years, Honduras and other Taiwanese
allies in the region are hoping that more Taiwanese companies will invest more
in Honduras and bring in more funds and technology to rev up bilateral trade and
counter pressure from China.</P>
      <P>He added that the increasing presence of Chinese influence in Guatemala --
another of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Central America -- particularly in
Guatemalan power plants, is now setting off alarm bells for Taiwan when it comes
to the "diplomatic tug of war."</P>
      <P>President Chen and his entourage arrived in the Honduran capital Tuesday for a
three-day state visit. He is scheduled to head for El Salvador Aug. 24 for
another three-day visit before traveling on to Nicaragua Aug. 26.</P>
      <P>He is set to conclude his Central American trip Aug. 28 and head home via
Alaska, arriving in Taipei Aug. 29.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's fifth gay pride parade -- Taiwan Pride 2007 -- to be organized by the
gay and transgender communities, is slated to take place Oct. 13 in Taipei City
with the aim of urging politicians to make laws regarding equal rights for
homosexuals, such as legalization of same-sex marriages, an organizer of the
event said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Titled "Rainbow Power, " this year's parade will call on gay communities around
Taiwan to join the campaign in order to have more people voice the parade's
appeal.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Tongzhi Hotline Association president, who goes by the pseudonym
Gofyy and who is also the parade's organizer, said last year's parade attracted
more than 10,000 people, including members of more than 80 homosexual groups.</P>
      <P>Gofyy estimated that Taiwan has at least 1 million homosexuals, which constitute
an influential group and a crucial minority for the "single-member constituency,
two-vote" electoral system, and so is worth attention from politicians.</P>
      <P>Gender/Sexuality Rights Association Taiwan Secretary-General Wang Ping said this
year's parade will start from the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, where a group will
perform a skit to represent their appeal. The group will then march to Taipei

      <P>Only four applications from Chinese citizens for purchasing real estate in
Taiwan have been approved since the government began allowing the practice in
2002, according to a news release issued by the Ministry of the Interior (MOI)
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The reason so few applications have been approved is that Beijing not only
imposes strict measures to control its foreign exchange reserves but has also
been reluctant to list Taiwan as a place in which Chinese people can purchase
real estate, the news release said.</P>
      <P>The MOI drew up regulations governing Chinese people acquiring, creating or
transferring property rights on Taiwanese real estate Aug. 8, 2002 after the
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) began allowing Chinese people to buy and own real
estate in Taiwan under certain conditions.</P>
      <P>According  to the MOI,  no approval  will be granted for applications by Chinese
people, corporations or groups, or companies funded with Chinese money to buy
real estate in Taiwan if such a purchase is deemed to possibly endanger national
security or social order.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's foreign aid projects should not be criticized because they are
conducive to Taiwan's diplomacy and do not account for a high proportion of the
general budget of the central government, Executive Yuan Secretary-General Chen
Chin-jun said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in defense of President Chen Shui-bian's promise to have
state-owned Taiwan Power Co. help build a hydraulic power plant in Honduras,
which is one of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Central America, with investment
of up to NT$10 billion (US$303 million).</P>
      <P>Opposition  lawmakers questioned the president's  diplomatic strategy of
spending such a huge amount of money on foreign aid when Taiwan and Honduras has
bilateral trade of only US$43 million per year, which accounts for only 0.01
percent of Taiwan's total trade volume. They described the project as another
case of "checkbook diplomacy."</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan's foreign aid projects do not deserve such "negative wording,"
stressing that the foreign aid budget is "reasonably used and under control."</P>
      <P>He said that although next year's diplomatic budget is NT$31.6 billion
(US$956.13 million), up 10.1 percent over 2007's figure, the foreign aid budget

      <P>Taiwan's foreign aid budget is much less than member countries of the

      <P>A loose bolt from the right wing slat of the Taipei-based China Airlines (CAL)
Boeing 737-800 that was gutted by fire at Okinawa's Naha International Airport
three days ago pierced a fuel tank, causing a leak that triggered a fire and
explosion, Taiwan's top official in charge of aviation safety said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Yang Hung-chih, executive director of the Cabinet-level Aviation Safety Council,
said Japanese investigators had discovered a bolt that came off the wing slat
and established the cause of the fuel leak but was still trying to find out why
the bolt came off.</P>
      <P>Yang said Japan's Aircraft and Railway Accidents Investigation Commission was
leading the investigation into the cause of the accident and that he was only
giving a technical description of the cause with the consent of the Japanese
side.</P>
      <P>He noted that Boeing had reported in March last year two accidents in which wing
leading edge bolts had come off, one of which also caused a fuel leak.</P>
      <P>Although  Boeing suggested  that all B737-600s,  B737-700s, B737-800s and
B737-900s should have their wing leading edge slats inspected, the company did
not require airlines using these aircraft to replace the nuts and bolts.</P>
      <P>He said CAL maintenance personnel had inspected the wing slats of its Boeing
737-800 fleet after receiving the notice from Boeing.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  wire service reports  from Tokyo said Japanese investigators had
discovered a 2-3-centimeter hole in the fuel tank of the ill-fated aircraft.</P>
      <P>Wing slats are movable auxiliary airfoils running along the leading edge of the
wings. They can be retracted to help increase the plane's lift during take-off

in international justice and righteousness.</P>
      <P>Following the breakup of ROC-Costa Rica diplomatic ties, Chen said all of
Taiwan's other Central American diplomatic allies immediately reaffirmed their
commitment to maintaining official relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Touching on Taiwan's aid to Honduras, Chen said all donations or loans to the
Honduran government have been conducted in a transparent manner, with news media
invited to witness relevant ceremonies.</P>
      <P>In an effort to discount speculation that Taiwan might be engaging in "checkbook
diplomacy, " Chen said many of Taiwan's aid projects have been carried out in
the form of participating in Honduras' build-operate-transfer investment
projects rather than through outright cash donations.</P>
      <P>Asked about Taiwan's strategies toward China's fast rise as an economic
powerhouse, Chen said his frequent grueling diplomatic tours around the world
are aimed at telling the world that Taiwan will not succumb to the Communist
Party of China's threat.</P>
      <P>Chen and his entourage arrived in the Honduran capital Tuesday for a three-day
state visit. He is scheduled to head for El Salvador Aug. 24 for another three-
day visit before traveling on to Nicaragua Aug. 26.</P>
      <P>He is set to wrap up his Central American visit Aug. 28 and head home via
Alaska, arriving in Taipei Aug. 29.</P>

      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian arrived in El Salvador Friday from
Honduras to continue his three-nation Central America visit.</P>
      <P>Chen received a warm welcome at the San Salvador international airport from the
country's president, vice president, president of the Legislative Assembly, and
president of the Supreme Court of Justice.</P>
      <P>In a grand welcome ceremony, Chen inspected with his Salvadoran counterpart,
Antonio Saca, the country's military honor guards, before Saca gave his formal
greetings to Chen and his entourage.</P>
      <P>Saca said his country shares with Taiwan the same ideas and principles of
pursuing democracy, national progress and sustainable development.</P>
      <P>He further said that President Chen's visit is an opportunity for El Salvador to
reiterate its admiration of Taiwan's achievements in realizing these ideas and
its support for Taiwan's ceaseless struggle for its existence in the
international community.</P>
      <P>Saca noted that during Chen's state visit, the two sides will act to strengthen
their dialogue, which will serve efforts to seek better living conditions for
their people and will serve as a bridge in enhancing their friendship,
understanding and communications.</P>
      <P>In his address, Chen mentioned that he last visited El Salvador in May 2001.
Since then, Saca has twice visited Taiwan, in 2004 and 2006, he added.</P>

maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan and firmly support Taiwan's bid for
membership in the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Chen added that Saca has said that he will attend the U.N. General Assembly to
be held in New York next month and will speak in support of Taiwan's bid in

      <P>American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairman Raymond F. Burghardt will greet
President Chen Shui-bian in person when Chen makes a transit stop in Anchorage,
Alaska, Aug. 29 en route home from his three-nation Central America visit.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's deputy representative to the United States, Stanley Kao, made the
remarks at a news conference at Taiwan's representative office in Washington,
D.C., Friday.</P>
      <P>Burghardt is the top U.S. liaison officer with Taiwan in the absence of
diplomatic ties between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Kao said Burghardt was in Hawaii on official business and so was not able to
greet Chen Aug. 21 when the president made a transit stop in Anchorage on his
way to Central America to attend the sixth leadership summit between Taiwan and
its diplomatic allies in the region held in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa.</P>
      <P>Chen was therefore greeted by William Brown, AIT honorary chairman, Kao said,
adding that the U.S. government had informed the representative office about the
arrangements prior to Chen's arrival in Anchorage.</P>
      <P>The U.S. government has reportedly refused to allow President Chen to stop over
in any major U.S. city other than Anchorage, Alaska for his latest visit to
Central America or to stay overnight during his transit stops in order to show
its displeasure with the Taiwan government's push for a referendum on the
country's bid to join the United Nations under the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>When Brown boarded Chen's plane in Anchorage to greet him on his first stopover,
the president described the treatment he had received from the U.S.  government
as "inconvenient,  uncomfortable and indecent, " according to Presidential
Office Deputy Secretary-General Chen Chi-mai. President Chen did not disembark
the plane during the stopover.</P>
      <P>The president also said that he hopes the U.S. government will follow
established conventions in making arrangements for visiting high-level Taiwan
officials.</P>
      <P>Asked whether U.S. authorities would accept President Chen's suggestion that the
Bush administration send a delegation to Taipei for direct dialogue on the U.N.
bid issue, Kao said he believes that the U.S. side has been informed of Chen's
proposal.</P>

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Saturday that the government will provide relief

      <P>Chang made the remarks at the Yenchao Main Workshop, which is the Taiwan High
Speed Rail's maintenance base in the southern County of Kaohsiung Saturday.</P>
      <P>The subsidies for damaged equipment was added this year into the government's

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian expressed his gratitude for El
Salvador's longstanding and steadfast friendship and full support for Taiwan's
bid to join international organizations in his speech delivered at the
Salvadoran Legislative Assembly Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen visited the legislative assembly just hours after arriving in the country
from Honduras for the second leg of his three-nation Central America visit that
will also take him to Nicaragua.</P>
      <P>In his first ever speech to the Salvadoran legislature, Chen compared Taiwan's
efforts in pursuing freedom and democracy with those of El Salvador, adding the
two countries share many similar experiences in this pursuit.</P>
      <P>Chen said El Salvador was wracked by 12 years of civil war before the signing of
a peace agreement under U.N. mediation Jan. 16, 1992. The country then began
efforts to establish a democratic and constitutional government, he noted,
adding that he was impressed by the Salvadoran people's diligence which helped
the country become a model of democracy for countries around the world in a
short period of just 15 years.</P>
      <P>He described El Salvador as a "phoenix rising from the ashes."</P>
      <P>Speaking about Taiwan,  the president said his country is celebrating this year
the 20th anniversary of the lifting of martial law.</P>
      <P>In 1991, Taiwan began holding legislative elections for all seats in both the
Legislative Yuan and the National Assembly, and then in 1996 it held its first
direct presidential election, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan experienced its first transfer of power between political
parties in 2000 when he was elected president as the candidate of an opposition
party, Chen said he is very proud of this fact.</P>
      <P>Chen further said that he has worked to consolidate Taiwan's democracy during
his time in office, noting he put forward Taiwan's first Referendum Law in 2003
and oversaw Taiwan's first national referendum in 2004, and that he has also
pushed several major constitutional reforms since assuming office.</P>
      <P>However,  Chen said, despite its world-acclaimed democratic achievements, Taiwan
is still not recognized as a "normal country."</P>
      <P>Due to China's suppression, Taiwan has been prevented from joining many
international organizations such as the United Nations and the World Health
Organization, he said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Taiwan will never give up its efforts, he stressed, pointing out
that recent surveys show that 77 percent of the Taiwan people want to see the
country become a member of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Chen said that with this strong support, his government began to push for a
referendum on whether Taiwan should apply to join the United Nations under the
name of Taiwan. He explained that holding such a referendum will give the Taiwan
people the opportunity to directly convey their wish to the world body.</P>
      <P>In the speech, President Chen also extended his appreciation for Salvadoran
Legislative Assembly's passage Aug. 10 of a free trade agreement, which was
forged by the governments of the two countries in May.</P>
      <P>Chen said he expects that Taiwan's Legislative Yuan will also pass the
agreement,  which  he described  as a milestone  in Taiwan-Salvadoran trade and
economic cooperation, in the near future, adding that he anticipates that the
pact will take effect at the beginning of next year.</P>
      <P>After the speech, Chen was presented by the assembly president, Ruben Orellana,
with a copy of a resolution passed by the legislature to grant Chen with the
country's highest honor for a foreign friend in recognition of his contributions
to the country through various technical assistance and aid programs.</P>
      <P>Others present at the gathering  included  members of the Legislative Assembly
presidium, leaders of legislative caucuses of the country's political parties,
assembly members, the president of the Supreme Court of Justice, grand justices,
high-ranking executive officials and foreign diplomats stationed in the country.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Urban planning officials said Saturday they are concerned about a possible
"domino effect" if the Taipei City government's Maokong rezoning plan is
approved.</P>
      <P>The officials from the Ministry of the Interior's Construction and Planning
Agency (CPA) were referring to the city government's urban development plan for
a protected area in Wenshan District in suburban Taipei, commonly known as
Maokong.</P>
      <P>The city government referred the development plan to the CPA for approval in
2006. The plan covers 238 hectares of protected land encompassing slopes and
other geological formations as well as many intertwining footpaths. It marks the
first time that such a large plot of protected land will be put up for rezoning
and development.</P>
      <P>Earlier this week, the officials said, the CPA arranged for members of its urban
planning commission to inspect the site to be rezoned under the city
government's development plan.</P>
      <P>"Members of the commission are most concerned about whether approval of the
Maokong rezoning plan will cause a 'domino effect, ' with owners of land plots
in protected areas in the city's Nangang, Neihu and Beitou districts demanding
similar treatment, " a CPA official said, adding that the CPA will ask the city
government to furnish it with an assessment report on this question.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the official said, the city government should also come up with a
report on the main purposes and functions of its Maoking rezoning and urban
development plan.</P>
      <P>"The CPA's urban planning commission members are also concerned about whether
individual land development applicants in the area should be required to produce
concrete development projects and financial planning reports for the city
government's screening if the rezoning plan is approved," the official said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the official said, the city government should also present a report
on requiring would-be land developers to share environmental protection
obligations and on formulation of a feedback mechanism.</P>
      <P>The CPA's urban planning commission will continue screening the plan after the
city government produces all relevant reports and data, the official said.</P>
      <P>Maokong used to be the largest tea growing area in Taipei. There are many
winding footpaths which have been used to transport tea. Now, it's a popular
place for tea culture and viewing the night scenery of Taipei City. The recent
inauguration of the Maokong Gondola has added yet another tourist attraction to
the area.</P>

      <P>With the help of physical therapists and family members, about 100 patients with
rare disorders enjoyed some fun taking part in a sports meet in Taipei Saturday
afternoon.</P>
      <P>The sports meet, which was organized by the Taiwan Foundation for Rare Disorders
(TFRD) as the first ever sporting event in Taiwan for patients with rare
disorders, gathered 89 patients of all ages suffering from various disorders.</P>
      <P>The participants were divided into four groups and competed in various events,
including batting, basketball shooting and soccer ball kicking competitions as
well as foot races,  during the three-hour meet.</P>
      <P>Organizers of the event said that most of the participants have one of three
disorders, namely Prader-Willi Syndrome, a complex genetic disorder that
typically causes cognitive disabilities and obesity; Anchondroplasia, a genetic
disorder that is a common cause of dwarfism; or Tuberous Sclerosis, which causes
benign tumors to grow in the brain and on other organs.</P>
      <P>One of the participants, named Wu Chih-kang, 26, has been suffering from
Wilson's Disease since his junior year at National Cheng Kung University. Wu, a
basketball fanatic who said he could dunk a basketball when he was younger, has
been recovering well after more than six years of rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>Wilson's Disease is one of more than 130 rare disorders which have been found in
Taiwan, according to a TFRD news release.</P>
      <P>"Most people think that it's better for patients with rare disorders to stay
indoors and rest as much as possible. In fact, appropriate exercise is good for
them, " said Chien Wen-jen, president of the National Federation of Association
of Physical Therapists (NFAPT).</P>
      <P>"Without a doubt, patients with rare disorders need professional medical care at
all times. However, the physiological and mental development aspect has often
been neglected. This event aims to remind the patients and their families of
just that, " said TFRD chief executive officer Yang Yung-hsiang.</P>
      <P>NFAPT and sporting goods giant adidas Taiwan co-sponsored the event. Singer Tank
and local professional basketball players Lee Hsueh-lin, Chang Chi-fung, Chien
Chia-hung and Chen Tzu-wei also took part in the charity event.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan official stationed in Washington said Friday he has taken reports about
U. S. efforts to persuade Taiwan's diplomatic allies to vote against its U.N.
bid at this year's U.N. General Committee session with "grain of salt."</P>
      <P>Stanley Kao, the Republic of China's deputy representative to the United States,
was referring to an article written by Bonnie Glaser, a senior associate at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies.</P>
      <P>Glaser said in the article that President Chen Shui-bian's push for a referendum
on Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations under the name of Taiwan could prompt
Taiwan-U.S. relations into a dangerous quagmire as the Bush administration may
adopt a series of punitive measures, including lobbying Taiwan's diplomatic
allies to vote against Taiwan when the U.N. General Committee discusses in
September whether to include Taiwan's membership bid into the General Assembly
agenda.</P>
      <P>Kao said while meeting with Taiwan reporters stationed in the U.S. capital that
the ROC representative office took such a report with "pinch of salt."</P>
      <P>As to the ROC allies' stance toward the U.N. bid, Kao said 15 allies have signed
a letter asking the U.N. General Assembly to address Taiwan's representation
issue at its upcoming annual session. Moreover, he said, senior leaders of the
countries allies in Central America have voiced support for Taiwan's U.N. bid
when they attended a leadership summit in Honduras earlier this week which
President Chen also attended.</P>
      <P>Kao explained that the U.N. referendum proposal is part of Taiwan's efforts to
arouse global heed to its diplomatic plight of being shut out of the United
Nations  and other major world organizations simply because of China's
opposition.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the three allies which have not yet endorsed the letter to the
U.N. Secretariat regarding Taiwan's membership bid are the targets that the
United States are lobbying to vote against the country, Kao said he would not
like to speculate. He added that Taiwan's relations with those three countries
have been firm and stable. Those countries have traditionally thrown support
behind Taiwan's bids for membership in the U.N. and the World Health
Organization, he added.</P>
      <P>As to reports that China may come up with a proposal asking the U.N. General
Assembly to pass a resolution recognizing that Taiwan is part of China, Kao said
some U.S. think tanks and news media hae indeed reported on that possibility. Up
until now, he said all such reports remain speculative and are subjected to
stringent scrutiny.</P>
      <P>According to Kao, the representative office in Washington, D.C. is keeping close
track on relevant development.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu called for Kaohsiung citizens Saturday to support the
country's bid to join the United Nations under the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen made the request at a garden party held at the Kaohsiung Museum of Fine
Arts plaza in an effort to drum up public support for the U.N. bid.</P>
      <P>The  activities  included  a variety  of music  and dance performances, free
hot-air balloons rides, and a signature drive in support of the U.N. bid.</P>
      <P>Chen said joining the United Nations is not an impossible task for Taiwan,
noting that many people in the country had thought that lifting martial law was
impossible but that the dream was eventually realized.</P>
      <P>It is unreasonable  for Taiwan  to be excluded  from the international
organization, Chen said, pointing out that Taiwan is the world's 16th largest
trading nation and 17th largest economy.</P>
      <P>Twu Shiing-jer, secretary-general of the Taiwan United Nations Alliance,
expressed the hope that the Taiwan people will work together to help Taiwan

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to offer duty-free sugar import quota for El Salvador</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Salvador,  El Salvador,  Aug.  25 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will offer duty-free sugar import quota for El Salvador under a bilateral
free trade agreement, Minister of Economic Affairs Steve R.L. Chen said in San
Salvador Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen, who is accompany President Chen Shui-bian on a three-day state visit in El
Salvador after attending Taiwan-Central America leadership summit in Honduras,
made the remarks after Salvadoran President Antonio Saca promulgated his
country's free trade pact with Taiwan earlier that same day.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan's legislature ratifies the free trade agreement with El Salvador
during its coming legislative session, Chen said, the pact will take effect in
Taiwan at the beginning of next year.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, Chen said Taiwan will offer a tariff-free import quota of
35,000 tons for Salvadoran sugar in the first year of the implementation of the
pact, and the amount will be raised to 50,000 tons in the second year and
further increased to 60,000 in the third year. The maximum annual duty-free
quota will be capped at 60,000 tons, he added.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Taiwan's annual sugar demand ranges between 500,000 tons and
600,000 tons. In the past, state-owned Taiwan Sugar Co. (Taisugar) monopolized
Taiwan's sugar supply. But the monopoly has long been phased out and sugar trade
has been fully liberalized, Chen said, adding that the free trade pact will
enhance Salvadoran sugar's competitiveness in Taiwan but will in no way affect
Taiwan sugarcane farmers' interests. Taisugar will continue to collect sugarcane
from local farmers at set prices, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said Taiwan will also benefit from the free trade pact by
gaining easier access to sell industrial products to El Salvador. Moreover, he
said El Salvador is one of the countries that have signed Central America Free
Trade Agreement (CAFTA) with the United States. Taiwan companies that invest in
El Salvador can ship products to the United States under the CAFTA framework,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to Chen,  the government  has encouraged  Taiwan businesses to invest
in El Salvador by offering soft loans. Taiwan has so far invested about US$78
million in El Salvador.</P>
      <P>Among others, Taiwan companies are launching two new investment projects in El
Salvador, under which two industrial parks will be built in the Central American
country. President Chen will attend the groundbreaking  ceremony for the Sanli
Industrial  Park before concluding his visit in El Salvador Saturday.</P>
      <P>On Friday, President Chen accepted Salvadoran President Saca's invitation to
help promote Salvadoran coffee in the Taiwan market. According to Economics
Minister Chen, Taiwan imported US$32 million worth of coffee last year, with
only 11 percent from Central American countries. "There is still amply room for
the promotion of coffee imports from Central American countries, including El
Salvador, " he added.</P>

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank Hsieh
wooed Hakka voters Saturday with promises to promote Hakka language and culture
as well as accelerate economic development in Hakka communities if he wins the
presidency.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the pledges while attending a rally in front of the Yiming Temple in
Hsinpu, a Hakka township in the northern county of Hsinchu, in the company of
his running mate Su Tseng-chang and Presidential Office Secretary-General Yeh
Chu-lan, who concurrently serves as the Hsieh campaign's top strategist.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time that the three DPP bigwigs have attended a campaign
rally together since the formation of the Hsieh-Su ticket for the 2008
presidential election earlier this month.</P>
      <P>Su, a former premier, was Hsieh's closest rival in the DPP's hotly contested
presidential primary and he agreed to join Hsieh on the ticket only after many
twists and turns. As to Yeh, she was reportedly to be Hsieh's original choice
for his running mate, but Hsieh changed his mind later and eventually decided to
team up with Su with a view to boost party unity and enhance his chance of
victory in the presidential race.</P>
      <P>As Yeh is favored by many of her Hakka fellows to join Hsieh on the 2008 ticket,
Hsieh deliberately chose the Hsinpu Hakka community as the place for his first
campaign rally together with Su and Yeh to stage a tableau of unity and party
coherence.</P>
      <P>Addressing the rally, Hsieh, who had served as premier and Kaohsiung mayor, said
he believes that Yeh can follow his footsteps in becoming a premier one day.
"And if I can be elected president, a Hakka woman will also be able to win the
presidency in the future," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Since the DPP won the presidency in 2000, Hsieh said a Hakka television station
has been established and Hakka language has been actively promoted. Hsieh said
he himself took a Hakka proficiency test during his premiership from 2005 to
early 2006.</P>
      <P>He promised to boost ethnic harmony and glorify Hakka culture if elected the
next president.</P>
      <P>Su, who succeeded Hsieh to serve as premier, addressed the rally in fluent Hakka
as he once served as magistrate of the southern county of Pingtung which has a
large Hakka population.</P>
      <P>For her part, Yeh urged her Hakka fellows and friends to support the Hsieh-Su
ticket to help the homegrown DPP retain its grip on power next year.</P>
      <P>Many Hakka heavyweights residing in Hsinchu County, including former Hsinchu
Magistrate Lin Kuang-hua, also attended the rally to lend their support.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will offer duty-free sugar import quota for El Salvador under a bilateral
free trade agreement, Minister of Economic Affairs Steve R.L. Chen said in San

      <P>Chen, who is accompany President Chen Shui-bian on a three-day state visit in El

made the remarks after Salvadoran President Antonio Saca promulgated his

      <P>If Taiwan's legislature ratifies the free trade agreement with El Salvador
during its coming legislative session, Chen said, the pact will take effect in
Taiwan at the beginning of next year.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, Chen said Taiwan will offer a tariff-free import quota of
35,000 tons for Salvadoran sugar in the first year of the implementation of the
pact, and the amount will be raised to 50,000 tons in the second year and
further increased to 60,000 in the third year. The maximum annual duty-free
quota will be capped at 60,000 tons, he added.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Taiwan's annual sugar demand ranges between 500,000 tons and
600,000 tons. In the past, state-owned Taiwan Sugar Co. (Taisugar) monopolized
Taiwan's sugar supply. But the monopoly has long been phased out and sugar trade

said El Salvador is one of the countries that have signed Central America Free
Trade Agreement (CAFTA) with the United States. Taiwan companies that invest in
El Salvador can ship products to the United States under the CAFTA framework,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to Chen,  the government  has encouraged  Taiwan businesses to invest
in El Salvador by offering soft loans. Taiwan has so far invested about US$78
million in El Salvador.</P>
      <P>Among others, Taiwan companies are launching two new investment projects in El
Salvador, under which two industrial parks will be built in the Central American
country. President Chen will attend the groundbreaking  ceremony for the Sanli
Industrial  Park before concluding his visit in El Salvador Saturday.</P>
      <P>On Friday, President Chen accepted Salvadoran President Saca's invitation to
help promote Salvadoran coffee in the Taiwan market. According to Economics
Minister Chen, Taiwan imported US$32 million worth of coffee last year, with
only 11 percent from Central American countries. "There is still amply room for
the promotion of coffee imports from Central American countries, including El
Salvador, " he added.</P>

      <P>The European Economic and Trade Office in Taiwan (EETOT) is scheduled to publish
in September a handbook on investing in the European Union, according to a press

      <P>The handbook is aimed at allowing Taiwan investors to gain a better
understanding of the investment climate in the EU as well as trade and
investment opportunities in the world's largest economy, according to EETOT

China, Japan, South Korea and India, in that order.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A talent-hunting delegation from Taiwan began its work in Silicon Valley in
California Saturday in pursuit of experienced overseas high tech talent to work
in Taiwan, recruiting sources said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The delegation of representatives of leading enterprises and several academic
and research institutions is holding a series of activities in an attempt to
persuade foreign professionals to seek jobs  in Taiwan,  according  to Minister-
without-Portfolio  Lin Feng-ching, who is heading the delegation.</P>
      <P>The main appeal of this year's recruiting program is that the government has
passed an amendment law to allow draft-age males to serve in research and
development positions as an alternative to mandatory military service beginning
in 2008, aiming to encourage more young Taiwan expatriate talent to work in
Taiwan without the fear of being made to do military service.</P>
      <P>He said regardless of what subjects they major in and no matter whether they
studied in Taiwan or overseas, master's degree holders will be able to perform
R&amp;D services in government bodies and private enterprises instead of having
to join the military.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has also come up with programs focused on hunting senior
professionals with more than 15 years experience to serve as short-term
consultants in Taiwan, Lin said, adding that the fields of basic science,
biomedical technology, image display, digital content, information technology,
semiconductors,  energy technology, environmental and natural conservation, nano
and high-end technology all require manpower.</P>
      <P>There is also still great demand for engineers,  business executives, managers
and R&amp;D chiefs.</P>
      <P>The government also provides preferential incentives for foreign professionals
and experts to work in Taiwan, including simplified tax procedures, relaxed
regulations relating to work and residence permits and school places for the
children of overseas employees.</P>
      <P>Since the launch of the overseas talent-seeking event in 2003, it has managed to
recruit 2,850 people, Lin said, adding that this year, 1,370 jobs provided by 42
government agencies and private companies will be available.</P>
      <P>The delegation was in Silicon Valley in San Francisco Saturday and will travel
to Los Angeles, Houston, Washington, D.C. and Toronto until Sept. 4 to conduct
seminars, press conferences and one-on-one interviews with overseas
professionals seeking work in Taiwan, Lin added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) cautioned against the burning
of environmentally harmful ghost money and incense Sunday, saying that violators
could face fines of up to NT$100,000 (US$3,040).</P>
      <P>With the approach of the traditional Zhongyuan Ghost Festival, during which
Taiwan people prepare feasts and burn ghost money as offerings for "ghosts from
the nether world, " EPA officials reiterated to the public that it is illegal to
burn ghost money and incense  outdoors  and  said  violators  will  be fined
from NT$5,000-100,000.</P>
      <P>EPA officials said that when ghost money is burned, hazardous pollutants,
including oxysulfide, nitrogen oxide and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, will
be released into the atmosphere, causing harm not only to humans but also to the
environment.</P>
      <P>EPA officials also quoted research results published by the Consumers'
Foundation as indicating that burning incense is equally harmful, with the
release into the open air of pollutants such as benzene, methyl benzene and
ethyl benzene.</P>
      <P>So far, authorities in 15 cities and counties around the country, including
Taipei City and Taipei County as well Kaohsiung City and Kaohsiung County, have
offered to burn ghost money and incense together for worshippers in closed
locations to reduce pollution, EPA officials said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the centralized burning service is not aimed at encouraging the
public to burn ghost money but to raise their environmental awareness, EPA
officials warned the public to stop burning ghost money altogether, because the
substances released upon burning are hazardous.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, they said, the counties of Taipei, Taoyuan, Kaohsiung and Pingtung,
as well as the Kaohsiung City, have even begun to provide online worship rituals
to allow the public to worship gods or appease ghosts in complete cleanliness.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that Taiwan "cannot afford to not
maintain diplomatic relations with all the countries in the world," adding that
having no allies would adversely affect national morale.</P>
      <P>Talking to members of Taiwan media outlets traveling with Chen on his three-
nation Central American visit since Aug. 21, he made the remarks in response to
a reporter's inquiry of whether it could be an option for Taiwan to maintain no
formal diplomatic relations with any countries.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, if Taiwan maintains no formal ties with any countries, it
would immediately become "an international orphan" and national morale would be
smashed completely.</P>
      <P>He added that the number of countries maintaining formal ties with Taiwan is
changeable, but said it would be unacceptable for Taiwan to maintain no formal
ties and that such a scenario would be "impossible."</P>
      <P>As to the issue of the U.N. recognizing both Taiwan and China, Chen told the
reporters that he chatted with William Brown, the honorary chairman of the
American Institute in Taiwan, during his transit stop in Alaska several days ago
and was told that in 1971, when Beijing was given the "China seat" in the United
Nations, George H.W. Bush, when he was the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., proposed
that Taiwan and China be admitted at the same time.</P>
      <P>The then-Kuomintang (KMT) administration, however, rejected the proposal and
insisted on leaving the U.N. in the face of Beijing's presentation, Chen quoted
Brown as saying.</P>
      <P>He added that the KMT made the wrong decision and said the whole country is
suffering the consequences.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party administration would choose to accept
dual recognition and would not mind if Taiwan's allies also maintained
diplomatic relations with China. "Taiwan is much more magnanimous than China,"
he claimed.</P>
      <P>Chen and his 88-member entourage arrived in El Salvador Friday for a three-day
state visit, the second leg of Chen's three-nation Central American visit.</P>
      <P>The group was in Honduras Aug. 21-24 to attend a Taiwan-Central America
leadership summit.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to travel on to Nicaragua Aug. 26. He is set to wrap up his

      <P>Taiwan's first Taitronics India, to be held Sept. 14-16 at the Chennai Trade
Center in the southeastern Indian city, has lined up 97 exhibitors, including
some of Taiwan's top information and telecommunications technology (ICT)
manufacturers, organizers said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The exhibitors will man 107 stalls at the exhibition to display state-of-the-art
ICT products,  as well as machine tools, car accessories,  hand  tools  and
components,  according  to the semi-official Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA) , which is organizing the show with the Taiwan Electrical  and
Electronic Manufacturers' Association.</P>
      <P>Taitronics India will coincide with Connect 2007, India's largest ICT
conference, which will be held in Chennai Sept. 14-17. Last year's conference
attracted between 60,000 and 70,000 participants.</P>
      <P>Conspicuous among the exhibitors are Holtek Semiconductor Inc., one of Taiwan's
top 10 IC designers, and Wintek Corp., a major producer of liquid crystal
displays (LCDs) and liquid crystal modules (LCMs).</P>
      <P>Wintek officials said the company will set up a factory in Chennai's Nokia
Telecom Special Economic Zone by the end of this year to produce some 9 million
LCDs per month.</P>
      <P>Several other key LCD makers --  Bolymin Inc.,  Giantplus Technology Co. and Lee
Ming Industrial Co. -- will also display their lastest products at the show.</P>
      <P>The organizers of Taitronics India will also host a series of economic and
industrial cooperation seminars during the three-day exhibition and arrange for
Taiwanese companies to meet with potential partners.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's IC industries are interested in forming cooperative relationships with
Indian companies because the two sides can complement each other. While Taiwan
is a powerhouse for IT hardware manufacturing, India is known for its software
and system designs.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Institute for Information Industry set up its first overseas research
and development center at Olympia Technology Park in Chennai in May last year.</P>
      <P>India ranks 25th among Taiwan's  trade partners.  Official statistics show that
two-way trade between Taiwan and India totaled US$2.71 billion in 2006, with
Taiwan enjoying a favorable balance of US$226 million. India accounted for 0.64
percent of Taiwan's external trade.</P>

      <P>A teenager was rescued from an apartment in Chiayi City Sunday 21 days after he
was kidnapped for ransom in Tuku, Yunlin County, police said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Four men who were allegedly involved in the kidnapping were arrested at the
Chiayi apartment, police in Yunlin said.</P>
      <P>The 17-year-old teenager, identified by his surname Wang, was taken while he was
on his way to school Aug. 6.</P>
      <P>His bicycle was later found by the side of a country road 100 meters from his
school.</P>
      <P>The teenager's mother, who raised him alone, did not receive a ransom call until
Aug. 9 when a stranger called and asked her if her son was missing but hung up
before she could answer.</P>
      <P>The woman immediately alerted the police, who put a tap on her telephone.</P>
      <P>The next day the stranger called again demanding a ransom of NT$2 million
(US$60,461) which was reduced to NT$700,000 in subsequent negotiations and was
to have been paid on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Although the kidnappers used different public phones in different cities around
Chiayi and Yunlin counties during the negotiations, the police became suspicious
of two cars that regularly appeared near the public phones, both of which were
traced to a man named Yen Chih-ling living in Huwei, Yunlin County.</P>
      <P>Police began watching Yen's movements and monitoring his phone calls and found
he often visited an apartment in Chiayi in the company of three others.</P>
      <P>When Yen and his two associates left the apartment Sunday, police entered the
lobby of the apartment building and laid an ambush there.</P>
      <P>When the three came back, they were arrested and forced to make the man still in
the apartment open the door, whereupon the police stormed in and overpowered
him. A search of the apartment found the teenager hidden in a cardboard box with
his eyes blindfolded and hands tied, but otherwise unharmed.</P>
      <P>Two guns were also seized in the apartment.</P>

      <P>The Yilan International Children's Folklore and Folkgame Festival -- held
annually in July and August since 1996 -- became history after its 2007 event
ended Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Yilan County government made clear earlier this month that it will no longer
hold the festival in 2008 because declining numbers of visitors to the festival
in the past few years had caused the county government to suffer NT$50 million
(US$ 1.51 million) in losses each year.</P>
      <P>Yilan County Magistrate Lu Kuo-hua reiterated Sunday that the county government
will replace the festival with a different form of large-scale activity in
summer next year.</P>
      <P>He said the county government will first conduct an overall review to establish
why the Children's Folklore and Folkgame Festival was no longer attractive to
the public.</P>
      <P>Lu urged Yilan County residents to contribute creative ideas to to give new
meaning to local culture and tourism and make the county visible to the
international community through a new summer activity next year.</P>
      <P>He added that the 2008 event will no longer be in the form of a summer water
park playground alongside the Dongshan River, and that a new activity is needed
to reflect the full picture of the county's spirit, culture and tourism.</P>
      <P>"People should just wait and see, " Lu said, giving the assurance that the 2008
activity will be a "new eye opener."</P>
      <P>In its heyday, the Children's Folklore and Folkgame Festival attracted more than
800,000 visitors each year in 2001, 2002 and 2004. The festival was suspended in
2003 as a result of the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).</P>
      <P>Turnout decreased significantly in recent years, due to a combination of
factors, including dwindling national income, rising inflation,  the emergence
of similar outdoor water activities elsewhere in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although organizers tried to add variety by inviting troupes from other
countries to perform their folk songs and dances, lack of change in the main
program was believed to have caused the festival to lose its appeal.</P>

      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian who arrived here Friday for a three-
day visit said Saturday that he might come up with a new list of nominees for
members of Taiwan's Control Yuan, if the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan
agree to act on it. Talking to Taiwan-based journalists who accompanied him on
the visit, the president said he would change his list presented to the
legislature on Dec. 20, 2004 to accommodate the opposition's requests for the
sake of political harmony in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said he has asked Vice President Annette Lu before he left Taiwan for
Central America on Aug. 21 to sound out the opposition's opinion on the issue,
adding that the Control Yuan is an indispensable part of Taiwan government and
should not be left without members. Chen's list of 29 nominees which has to be
approved by the Legislative Yuan had been stonewalled by the opposition in the
legislature, mainly the Kuomintang and the People First Party on the ground that
it was packed with Chen's political proteges.</P>
      <P>The two parties said they won't act on the list, let alone approve it, unless
the president withdraws it and submits a new list.</P>
      <P>Considering it an affront, Chen refused the request, and asked the Legislative
Yuan to act on his list again on April 4, 2005 when a new legislature was in
session. His request was ignored and the Control Yuan which is the supreme
watchdog of the government had thereby left without members after the terms of
its previous members fell due on Jan. 31, 2005.</P>
      <P>The political impasse has raised the eyebrows of the country's grand justices
who ruled on Aug. 15 this year at the request of lawmakers of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party that the Legislative Yuan's refusal to carry out
its obligation to act on the president's nominations is not allowed by the
Constitution.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian and his 88-member entourage arrived in Nicaragua Sunday
to a red-carpet welcome ceremony presided over by Nicaraguan President Daniel
Ortega and his wife at the Managua International Airport.</P>
      <P>Soon after the welcome ceremony,  Chen and his Nicaraguan counterpart headed to
Matagalpa City in northern Nicaragua to attend a ceremony marking the kick-off
of a "Zero Hunger" project initiated by Ortega to help low-come families and
disadvantaged members of society.</P>
      <P>According to Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Samuel Santos, Chen and Ortega are
expected to discuss economic cooperation and investment issues during Chen's
two-day visit.</P>
      <P>Taiwan made a donation of US$30 million to Nicaragua last month to help build a
thermal power plant with a capacity of 30 megawatts.</P>
      <P>Ortega had said during his presidential campaign last year that he would switch
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing if elected. But after his victory
in the election and after President Chen attended his inauguation in January
this year, Ortega changed his mind and vowed that Nicaragua would maintain
formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Recently, however, Ortega expressed the hope that Nicaragua could maintain "good
relations with both sides of the Taiwan Strait."</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Nicaragua signed a free trade agreement in June last year. Currently,
Taiwan-invested textile plants in Nicaragua employ about 30,000 Nicaraguan
citizens.</P>
      <P>Two-way trade between Taiwan and Nicaragua topped US$46 million in 2005, with
textiles, zippers, kitchenware, plastic products and knitwear making up the bulk
of Taiwan's exports to Nicaragua, and frozen beef, coffee, scrap metals, timber
and cotton fabrics forming the bulk of its imports from the Central American
country.</P>
      <P>Chen arrived in Nicaragua from El Salvador, where he made a three-day state
visit, the second leg of his three-nation Central America trip.  He visited
Honduras  Aug.  21-24 to attend a Taiwan-Central America leadership summit.</P>
      <P>The president is scheduled to wrap up his visit Aug. 28 and head home via
Alaska, arriving in Taipei Aug. 29.</P>

precision machinery manufacturing, to Kaohsiung to create more economic benefits

      <P>The expert further advised the city government to draw up measures to attract
Taiwan businesspeople operating in China to return home and invest in the city,
like "salmon swimming back home to lay legs."</P>

      <P>The Hsinchu Science Park in northern Taiwan will soon have its own international
convention center, the head of the park administration said Monday.</P>
      <P>Huang Teh-jui, director of the science park administration, told a press
conference that the convention center and an "Elite Guest House" will be
officially inaugurated at the end of this year or early next year.</P>
      <P>The new facilities will provide more convenience to the nearly 400 high-tech
companies in the park in accommodating foreign visitors and holding
international conferences or technical seminars, Huang explained.</P>
      <P>He added that a huge lawn in front of the Elite Guest House has enough room for
large-scale outdoor activities attended by up to 10,000 people.</P>
      <P>Huang also said the Hsinchu Science Park's Creative Industry Center will be
inaugurated in September.</P>
      <P>The science park administration will now focus on improving the quality of its
service to the companies housed in the area, according to Huang.</P>
      <P>The Hsinchu Science Park, established in 1980, covers an area of 632 hectares.
It is one of three science parks in Taiwan, with the other two being the Central
Taiwan Science Park and the Southern Taiwan Science Park.</P>
      <P>While the focus of the Hsinchu park is semiconductor-related industries, that of
the Central Taiwan Science Park is the aviation, precision machinery and
optoelectronics industries, and that of the southern Taiwan park is
optoelectronics.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The negotiations in which Taiwan would like to engage again with Beijing on the
issue of the 2008 Olympic torch relay route would not just involve "wording" as
some media outlets have claimed recently, a Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
official said Monday.</P>
      <P>MAC spokesman Liu Te-hsun said that a main element of such negotiations would be
Taiwan's insistence that its sovereignty not be compromised in the torch relay
arrangements.</P>
      <P>Liu noted that Taiwan's stance is firm on four prerequisites being met before
the 2008 Olympic torch relay can pass through Taiwan -- namely, that both sides
follow IOC protocol and regulations, that there should be consent by the
government of Taiwan, that Taiwan's sovereignty  should not be downgraded,  and
that all relevant activities should be conducive to future interaction between
the two sides.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan's position has not changed in this regard, Liu said Taiwan
hopes that the two sides can resume negotiations within the existing
communication channels as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Liu, however, declined to comment on whether Taiwan will drop its insistence
that the Olympic torch enter and exit Taiwan via a country other than China.</P>
      <P>An unconfirmed source said Monday that the two sides will settle the thorny
issue in negotiations to be completed by the end of August.</P>
      <P>Taiwan rejected the torch relay route proposed by Beijing in April that would
have included Taiwan as China's first "domestic" stop and would have had the
torch arriving in Taiwan from Vietnam and heading on to China-controlled Hong
Kong. The arrangement was viewed by Taiwan as an intentional move to downgrade
its sovereign status.</P>
      <P>MAC officials said earlier this month that Taiwan rejected China's proposal
because it violated a formal agreement reached between the two sides in 1989
that ensures that Taiwan has equal sporting status to China by referring to
Taiwan as "Chinese Taipei." China has often unilaterally referred to Taiwan as
"Taipei, China."</P>

      <P>A senior judiciary official who has been tipped to be nominated by President
Chen Shui-bian as the next chief of the Judicial Yuan said Monday he won't beg
for the post and will respect whatever decision the president makes on the
matter.</P>
      <P>Yang Jen-shou, chief commissioner of the Commission on the Disciplinary
Sanctions of Functionaries, made the remarks after Legislator Chen Chin-teh from
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party said that President Chen should not
nominate Yang and that Yang should turn down such a nomination as it would be
unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>The  lawmaker's  opinion  was  echoed  by  a  private judiciary-monitoring group
on the grounds that Yang doesn't deserve the job as chief of the judiciary,
which would automatically make him head of the Grand Justice Council, since he
has shown contempt for the post of grand justice by resigning from it in 2006 to
take on his current job.</P>
      <P>Yang's remarks represented an about-face on the issue of his possible nomination
since a presidential aide revealed it to the press on Aug. 17.</P>
      <P>It was reported on Aug. 22 that Yang had asked the president to drop him from
consideration, after a law professor at National Taiwan University questioned
the constitutionality of such a nomination.</P>
      <P>Noting that Yang served as a grand justice between 2003 and 2006 before he was
appointed to his current post, the professor said Yang is not eligible to be the
chief of the Judicial Yuan -- who automatically serves as a grand justice --
because the Constitution limits grand justices to a single term.</P>
      <P>The professor claimed that if Yang were to be nominated based on the reasoning
that he ended his term as grand justice early in order to serve in another post,
this would look like a "legal trick" to get around the constitutional limitation
and would not serve the interests of the nation.</P>
      <P>The United Daily News said on Aug. 22 that Yang has asked Legislative Speak Wang
Chin-pyng to relay his refusal politely to President Chen to pre-empt any
controversy.</P>
      <P>Wang confirmed the newspaper's report but said at that time that he had not yet
conveyed Yang's message to the president, who had left Taiwan for a nine-day
visit to Central America on Aug. 21.</P>
      <P>The term of the current Judicial Yuan president, Weng Yueh-sheng, expires at the
end of September this year.</P>

      <P>The number of students from Hong Kong and Macao who have applied to study at
universities in Taiwan during the 2007-2008 school year marks a record high, a
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>A total of 675 Hong Kong high school graduates and 1,993 Macao students have
applied to pursue higher education in Taiwan in the academic year that will
begin this autumn, Lo Mu-kun, director of the MAC's Hong Kong and Macao affairs
department, told the Central News Agency in an interview.</P>
      <P>In the previous school year, 413 Hong Kong students and 1,478 Macao students
filed such applications, Lo said.</P>
      <P>Lo said that during this summer, the council organized two short tours inviting
students from the two areas to Taiwan as part of its efforts to enhance the
students' understanding of the island.</P>
      <P>A total of 220 young students from Hong Kong and Macao joined the tours which
took them to several local universities, a science park in Taipei, and the
country's high speed rail station in the northern county of Hsinchu, Lo said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the visiting students attended several seminars which helped them
gain a better understanding of Taiwan's education policies, Lo noted.</P>
      <P>Citing past figures, Lo said that about 90 percent of students who join the
tours end up enrolling in universities in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>These students decide to study in Taiwan because Hong Kong and Macao are close
to Taiwan -- within two hours by plane -- and because they speak Chinese
mandarin, Lo said. The students are also attracted by the diverse programs
provided by Taiwan universities, he added.</P>
      <P>The council also organized another tour targeting Hong Kong and Macao college
students in mass media departments, Lo said, adding that these students visited
Taiwan's media outlets and related university departments.</P>
      <P>The students were also given opportunities to serve as interns at local
television stations, according to Lo.</P>
      <P>Lo said that the council hopes that through their visit to Taiwan, these future
media workers can better understand Taiwan's freedom of speech, democracy, and
diverse cultures.</P>

      <P>A Danish newspaper has published Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang's
letter calling for the Scandinavian country to support its application for U.N.
membership under the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Huang said in his letter published in the Saturday issue of Jyllands-Posten that
since 1993, the Republic of China has been unsuccessfully filing applications
for U.N. representation.</P>
      <P>The country decided to adopt a new strategy this year, applying under the name
of Taiwan, on the grounds that up to 77 percent of the people of Taiwan support
such a bid, according to Huang.</P>
      <P>Huang described Taiwan as a "model democracy of multi-party politics" that needs
more support from the international community.</P>
      <P>However, Huang wrote, the Chinese government suppresses Taiwan by demanding that
officials of other countries condemn Taiwan whenever the Taiwan government
displeases Beijing.</P>
      <P>Huang pointed out that China has deployed 1,000 missiles on its southeastern
coast targeting Taiwan and enacted an anti-secession law in 2005 to legitimize
China's use of force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Huang also wrote that Taiwan's new U.N. bid will "not adversely impact cross-
Taiwan Strait relations" because the country is not amending its Constitution to
change its national title, a move that would be regarded by China as a step
toward formal independence.</P>

      <P>Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Yang Tzu-pao and Tun Channareth,  a
"friendship ambassador" of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) ,
signed a pledge Monday to highlight Taiwan's resolve to remove its landmines in
line with global efforts.</P>
      <P>Speaking prior to the ceremony at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), Yang
said that the inking of the statement "helps underscore Taiwan's anti-war,
peace-loving determination."</P>
      <P>Through collective efforts on the Internet, humanitarian issues like this go far
beyond political and economic boundaries, Yang said, hailing the non-
governmental ICBL's long-term efforts in promoting the goal around the world.</P>
      <P>Citing MOFA statistics, Yang said that as of July 2004, 152 countries had signed
the statement.</P>
      <P>After years of efforts, the Taipei-based Eden Social Welfare Foundation, which
invited Channareth to visit Taiwan, eventually succeeded in pushing the
Legislative Yuan to approve a law May 26 last year on controlling landmines. The
law requires that all such devices across the country, mainly on the outlying
island of Kinmen, must be removed within seven years.</P>
      <P>Huang Chuo-sung, executive director of the Eden foundation, said the foundation,
which acts as the ICBS's representative in Taiwan, has in recent years donated
many wheelchairs and mine-sweeping vehicles to countries where there are large
numbers of mines planted in their soil.</P>
      <P>According to U.N. statistics, nearly 100 million armed mines are still scattered
throughout some 70 countries and areas that pose great threat to people living
there. The cost of an overall de-mining operation is estimated at US$33 billion
and the operation would take some 1,100 years even if no new mines were laid.</P>

      <P>Taiwan was urged Monday by anti-landmine activists to completely destroy all of
its recovered mines.</P>
      <P>Visiting Denise Coghlan,  who represents  the International Campaign to Ban
Landmines (ICBL) , said Taiwan has shown its determination to fully comply with
the Ottawa Treaty, as its legislature already passed the Statute for Anti-
personnel Landmine Control last year and its Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
signed a declaration Monday reassuring the support of the treaty.</P>
      <P>However, she went on, the most important thing for Taiwan is to destroy all its
stockpiles, which she claimed is something Taiwan has been reluctant to do. She
added that Taiwan's government has also not yet declared that it will ban the
use of landmines in war.</P>
      <P>She encouraged Taiwan to destroy its mine stockpiles since it has committed to
the Ottawa Treaty, even though Taiwan was not allowed to officially sign the
treaty because it is not a U.N. member.</P>
      <P>The Statute for Anti-personnel Landmine Control, which requires the removal of
anti-personnel mines from Taiwan's outlying islands of Kinmen, Matsu and Dong
Yin within seven years, was enacted in the legislature last year, and the
Ministry of National Defense (MND) has earmarked NT$4.2 billion to remove
minefields.</P>
      <P>Approximately 100,000 landmines are still in the ground on Taiwan's outlying
islands, said Robert Lin, vice chief executive officer of the Eden Social
Welfare Foundation, which has been an ICBL member working on Taiwan's anti-
landmine campaign for 10 years.</P>
      <P>Coghlan, who is based in Cambodia working on the anti-landmine campaign,  has
played an important  role in pushing  for the establishment of the Ottawa
Treaty, which was initiated in 1997 and has been signed by 154 countries with
the objectives of banning the use of and clearing all landmines, as well as
helping landmine victims.</P>
      <P>Coghlan said the Taiwan government "is one of the leading governments in
compensating landmine victims."</P>
      <P>The ICBL delegation is scheduled to visit the MND Tuesday before making an
inspection trip to the island of Kinmen.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Sunday in Nicaragua that he felt proud to be the
first foreign head of state to visit the birthplace of Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega's ruling Sandinista Party.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after Ortega took him to attend a ceremony in Matagalpa
City, northern Nicaragua, which marked the start of a "Zero Hunger" project
initiated by Ortega to help low-income families and disadvantaged members of
society.</P>
      <P>The US$150 million project is expected to benefit 75,000 families during the
next five years. The budget will come from the Nicaraguan government, foreign
governments, the United Nations, the World Bank and the World Food Program.</P>
      <P>Chen said the visit was part of promises Ortega made during his presidential
campaign last year that he would take a foreign president to the city -- which
is considered by locals as a "holy democratic site"-- if elected.</P>
      <P>Along the way, Chen went on, Ortega responded to many of his supporters who made
pleas for help. Ortega was elected president in the belief that only he can
bring peace, respect and hope, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that he and Ortega have a lot in common, Chen also said he can learn a
great deal from his Nicaraguan counterpart.</P>
      <P>Chen arrived in Nicaragua from El Salvador, where he made a three-day state
visit, the second leg of his diplomatic journey to Taiwan's three Central
American allies. He visited Honduras Aug. 21-24 for a leadership meeting with

      <P>Taiwan's representative to the United States said Sunday that he had voiced deep
concern to Washington and Taiwan's diplomatic allies over a reported plan by
China to seek international backing at the United Nations for its sovereign
claim on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Joseph Wu, Taiwan's top representative to the United States, made the comments
during an interview with the Voice of America radio station on questions about
Taiwan's efforts to join the United Nations and relevant issues after it was
reported that China plans to submit a proposal to the U.N. General Assembly next
month to tout member states' support for its claims that "Taiwan forms part of
China."</P>
      <P>Saying that the alleged move by China is an issue of maximum concern to Taiwan,
Wu added that Taiwan must express its grave concern regarding the matter to the
United States and Taiwan's diplomatic allies. So far, he said, no concrete
action has been seen with regard to China's alleged plan.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, President Chen Shui-bian last week told William Brown, honorary
chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan, that he hoped Washington could
"better understand"  the purpose behind Taiwan's U.N. bid.</P>
      <P>Wu also admitted that Chen's refueling stop in Anchorage, Alaska instead of
other U. S. city on his way to Central America for his current diplomatic tour
had "something to do" with Taiwan's plan to put the U.N. membership issue to a
public referendum alongside the next presidential election slated for March 22,
2008.</P>
      <P>Chen and his entourage wore stickers touting Taiwan's U. N. membership on their
shirts, while the plane's interior was decorated with the same stickers to
underscore Taiwan's desire to join the world body.</P>
      <P>Responding to the question of whether Chen's most recent transit was played down
by the U.S. side due to Washington's disagreement with Taiwan's referendum plan
on its U.N. bid, Wu said that it is unfair to judge overall Taiwan-U.S.
relations by just a stopover.</P>
      <P>As the United States has to deal with the latest developments in North Korea,
the Middle East and Venezuela, a quiet and more low-key situation in the Taiwan
Strait would allow Washington to better handle thorny international issues, he
explained, pointing out that apart from some political differences, Taiwan and
the United States actually share great benefits and enjoy common interests in
terms of economic prosperity and regional security.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan High Court sentenced a Canadian man to five years in prison Monday
for smuggling cannabis into Taiwan via express delivery in April last year.</P>

years of imprisonment for him, but the Taipei District Court passed a sentence
of 10 years.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court ruled that although Davis received US$1,500 as payment for
smuggling the cannabis, it could not be construed to mean that he had the
intention of selling the drugs.</P>
      <P>Describing the two kilograms of cannabis involved in the case as "not a small
amount," the court said the offense could not be compared with drug traffickers
who smuggle far larger quantities of drugs.</P>
      <P>The high court also took note of the fact that David was not a professional
criminal and that he was remorseful about what he had done. As a result, the
high court decided to reduce his sentence to five years.</P>
      <P>Cannabis is listed as a Class B drug in Taiwan. According to the Narcotics
Endangerment Prevention Act, anyone trafficking such a drug is liable to face
from seven years in prison to life.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tainan to set up monument for Taiwan's first battlefield</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan, Aug. 27 (CNA)
08/27/07  23:04:50
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Tainan city government will establish a monument  in memory of Taiwan's
first battlefield,  with the inauguration set for May next year.</P>
      <P>Tainan Mayor Hsu Tien-tsai and Netherlands Trade and Investment Office
representative Menno Goedhardt attended a ceremony Monday to pinpoint the
location where the monument will be erected.</P>
      <P>The 1661 war fought between Dutch colonists and Ming dynasty soldiers led by
Cheng Chen-kung (1624-1662) -- better known to the West as Koxinga -- near what
is now a space behind a temple in the An-An-Nan district of Tainan. The war
ended 38 years of Dutch rule of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>There are still tombs in the area for both the Chinese and Dutch soldiers who
died in the war.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the ceremony, Hsu said that Cheng, who received the title Koxinga,
meaning "bearer of the imperial surname," from the last emperor of the Ming
dynasty, moved his troops to Taiwan in April 1661 and fought the Dutch in a war
that lasted nine months.</P>
      <P>The mayor said this was the first major war in Taiwan's history, and that the
battlefield in Tainan should be called Taiwan's "first old battlefield."</P>
      <P>Goedhardt said he was grateful to see that the tombs of the Dutch soldiers have
been well-protected through the centuries, even though they were killed as
enemies.</P>
      <P>Koxinga is closely linked to the history of Taiwan, and the Tainan city
government apparently attaches great importance to his contributions to Taiwan
and especially to his close connection to the southern city.</P>
      <P>Several temples and facilities were built in An-Ping and Tainan and dedicated to
Koxinga and his mother after he expelled the Dutch. People not only worship him
as a national hero but regard him highly because of his loyalty to his emperor
even after the Ming dynasty collapsed.</P>
      <P>Although Koxinga's father, leader of a pirate force, surrendered to Ching
dynasty rulers, he continued to lead his father's armies to fight the Ching
emperor's overwhelming forces.</P>
      <P>After defeating the Dutch, Koxinga devoted himself to making Taiwan into an
effective base for anti-Ching sympathizers who planned to restore the Ming
dynasty to power.</P>
      <P>He died at the age of 38, probably of malaria.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP's `normal country' resolution completed</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) completed Monday the draft of a
"normal country" resolution, focusing on Taiwan's need to rectify its official
designation and write a new constitution amid constant threats from China.</P>
      <P>The draft was unveiled at a news conference after a meeting of the party's nine-
member task force dealing with the issue. Members of the  task  force  include
Vice  Premier  Chiou  I-jen,  DPP Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung and Legislator
Trong Chai who serves as the panel's convener. Several DPP legislators and
members of the party's Central Executive Committee also invited to attend the
meeting.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Lin Yao-wen, a close adie to DPP presidential candidate
Frank Hsieh, presented a new version of the draft for discussion together with a
party central-drafted edition. As party bigwigs have reached a consensus on the
content of the resolution, the draft was completed within slightly more than one
hour, party sources said.</P>
      <P>The draft resolution will be submitted to the party's Central Executive
Committee for approval at its weekly meeting Thursday and will then be put for
endorsement by party delegates at a party congress next month, the sources said.</P>
      <P>In addition to underscoring  Taiwan's  national sovereignty independent of
China, the draft resolution calls for a referendum to allow the public to have a
say on the issue "at the proper time."</P>
      <P>Pointing out that it is difficult to use the name Republic of China in the
international community, the draft resolution says the country should apply to
join world bodies in the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The draft also identifies China's hegemony and the remnants of the Kuomintang's
(KMT's) 55 years of authoritarian rule as major threats that Taiwan faces in its
struggle for normalization.</P>
      <P>The resolution points out that Beijing's "one China" principle and its anti-
secession law against Taiwan have threatened Taiwan's sovereignty and security
and caused abnormalties in Taiwan's foreign relations.</P>
      <P>The draft resolution also identifies the KMT's huge ill-gotten party assets and
the remnants of its authoritarian "party-state" system as threats to Taiwan's
democratic development, as they hinder normal inter-party competition.</P>
      <P>Wang Sing-nan, a whip of the DPP's legislative caucus, commented later in the
day that the "moderate" resolution will help lure middle-of-the-road voters to
the party in the March 22, 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the "normal country" resolution is more comprehensive than
the party's previous two resolutions known as "Taiwan independence platform" and
"Resolution on Taiwan's future" by clearly pointing out the prime perils to
Taiwan's efforts to become a normal country.</P>
      <P>The resolution was initiated early this year by DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun with
the aim of making Taiwan into what he called a "normal country." He deemed such
a resolution a key weapon to helping the party increase its chances in the next
presidential poll.</P>

      <P>China's saber-rattling and military intimidation of Taiwan over its fears of the
island's democratic development is the main source of regional instability, a
senior Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun made the remarks after the local media quoted
Chinese President Hu Jintao as having said recently that the only mission of the
People's Liberation Army (PLA) is to fight against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hu was quoted as having told a closed-door meeting of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) earlier this month that if the Democratic Progressive Party
administration-proposed referendum on Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations
under the name of Taiwan receives the support of more than half of Taiwanese
voters, the CPC may consider organizing a PLA military exercise to intimidate
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, Liu said the report had not been verified or confirmed
but added that the government will closely monitor the situation.</P>
      <P>Liu further said Taiwan's peaceful quest for participation in international
organizations and activities is aimed at protecting its national secutiry and
has nothing to do with the independence vs. unification dispute. Moreover, he
said a series of public opinion polls show that joining the United Nations under
the name of Taiwan is a common aspiration of the people of Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Name change not included in DPP 'normal country' resolution</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 27 (CNA)
08/28/07  01:54:20
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Certain controversial points, including the change of the country's title from
the Republic of China to Taiwan, were not included in the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) newly drafted "normal country" resolution, party
sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>The draft resolution, which is set to form a critical part of the DPP's campaign
platform for the 2008 presidential election, instead prioritizes underscoring
Taiwan's independent statehood.</P>
      <P>It calls for completion of the party's ultimate goal of rectifying the national
name and writing a new constitution as early as possible and holding a national
referendum at the proper time to underline Taiwan's status as an independent
sovereign state.</P>
      <P>The resolution further says that since it has become very difficult to use the
name Republic of China in the international community, the country should apply
to join the United Nations, the World Health Organization and other
international bodies in the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The DPP headquarters-drafted version originally suggested that the country's
title be changed to Taiwan, the ROC calendar be phased out and replaced with
Gregorian calendar, the existing "five branch" government system be replaced
with a "three-branch" one and the special municipality  be eradicated  from the
local government hierarchy.</P>
      <P>As some DPP bigwigs, including Frank Hsieh, the party's standard bearer in the
2008 presidential election, questioned the plausibility of those proposals, they
were all dropped from the final version of the draft resolution adopted Monday,
party sources said.</P>
      <P>The draft resolution identifies China's hegemony and the remnants of the
Kuomintang's (KMT's) 55 years of authoritarian rule as major threats that Taiwan
faces in its struggle for normalization.</P>
      <P>According to the resolution, Beijing's "one China" principle and its Anti-
Secession Law against Taiwan have threatened Taiwan's sovereignty and security
and caused abnormalities in Taiwan's foreign relations.</P>
      <P>The draft resolution also identifies the KMT's huge ill-gotten party assets and
the remnants of its authoritarian "party-state" system as threats to Taiwan's
democratic development, as they hinder normal inter-party competition.</P>
      <P>It further notes that the obsolescence of the ROC constitutional framework has
led to the country's constitutional abnormalities following the rotation of
governing parties.</P>
      <P>According  to the  resolution,  the  previous  government's suppression of
Taiwanese culture has made local people confused about their national identity
and the preferential treatment enjoyed by certain special groups has sabotaged
social unity and led to "abnormalities in social justice."</P>
      <P>To resolve all these abnormalities, the resolution calls for reinforcement of
Taiwan-centric  education in school curricula, promotion of transitional
justice, elimination of inequalities in resources distribution, acceleration of
judicial reform and retrieval of the KMT's ill-gotten party assets.</P>
      <P>The draft resolution was unveiled after an hour-long meeting of the party's
nine-member task force dealing with the issue. Members of the panel include Vice
Premier Chiou I-jen, DPP Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung and Legislator Trong
Chai who serves as the panel's convener. Several DPP legislators and members of
the party's Central Executive Committee also invited to attend the meeting.</P>
      <P>As party bigwigs have reached a consensus on the tone and highlights  the
content  of the resolution  through  extensive discussions in the past few days,
the draft was settled after one hour of discussion, party sources said.</P>
      <P>The draft resolution will be submitted to the party's Central Executive
Committee for approval at its weekly meeting Thursday and will then be put up
for endorsement by party delegates at a party congress next month, the sources
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Aid to Central America allies not 'checkbook diplomacy': MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Managua,  Nicaragua, Aug. 27 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The aid furnished by Taiwan to its Central American allies is part of bilateral
cooperation programs and should not be misrepresented as "checkbook diplomacy, "
Foreign Affairs Minister James Huang said in Nicaragua Monday.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks in response to criticism that President Chen Shui-bian is
wasting Taiwan taxpayers' money by making various aid offers during his current
three-nation visit to Central America.</P>
      <P>Huang said that the president "isn't bringing any checks" during the visit and
that it is "unfair" to level such criticism against him.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that none of the aid offers made by Chen during his visit are
new, noting that they are all part of programs that the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs has been carrying out for quite some time.</P>
      <P>They include a US$5 million loan to Honduras in support of a computerization
project,  a pledge to help Honduras  build a hydroelectric power plant, the
donation of 500 motorcycles to the Salvadoran police, and a US$1.1 million
project to help Nicaragua end poverty and hunger, Huang noted, adding that the
Central American allies were only making use of the opportunity of President
Chen's visit to publicize the projects so as to make their citizens aware of how
Taiwan is helping their countries.</P>
      <P>For example, Huang said, even before Chen's latest visit, Taiwan had already
provided US$830,000 in aid to Nicaragua under the project to fight poverty and
starvation.</P>
      <P>Huang said the project, which was launched before incumbent Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega was inaugurated in January this year, is a "very important one"
for Taiwan in terms of maintaining its relations with Ortega's Sandinista
National Liberation Front.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, in light of the fact that Nicaragua has to import 75,000
metric tons of rice per year to meet domestic demand, Taiwan has helped the
Central American country improve its rice output with the goal of increasing
yields under the anti-poverty project.</P>
      <P>Also, Taiwan has provided guidance to disadvantaged families in Nicaragua to
raise and sell hogs for a living, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, on Ortega's suggestion Sunday that Nicaragua and Taiwan replace free
trade with "fair trade, " Huang said that what Ortega meant was that trade
between the two countries should not only be free but also fair, because trade
that is 100 percent free is unfavorable to countries that are economically
disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Ortega's suggestion does not go against the spirit of the free
trade agreement established between the two countries, Huang said a major
purpose of Taiwan signing FTAs with its Central American allies is to facilitate
the export of products from these allies to Taiwan as a way of consolidating
bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Citing the example of Taiwan's import quota on Nicaraguan sugar, Huang said the
terms offered by Taiwan are more favorable than those offered by the United
States.</P>
      <P>On Nicaragua's desire to sell its coffee in Taiwan, Huang said this should not
be a problem as coffee consumption in Taiwan is quite high, noting that although
Taiwan only has a population of 23 million people, the country's coffee
consumption is three-quarters of the total coffee consumption in China, which
has a population of 1.3 billion people.</P>

      <P>The government will continue to push for the launch of a sports lottery despite
a recent scandal in which several local professional baseball players were
questioned on suspicion of taking bribes to rig games, Executive Yuan Secretary-
General Chen Chin-Jun said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The sports lottery is slated to be officially launched by April 15 next year at
the latest, Chen told the Central News Agency in an interview. The Sports
Affairs Council is currently in charge of planning the matter, he said.</P>
      <P>Expressing his great disappointment in the latest scandal, Chen said that
previous baseball fixing scandals have caused a sharp drop in game attendance to
2,000 people per game.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that Taiwan has produced many outstanding baseball players, some of
whom are currently working for other countries' baseball teams. Such a scandal
will hurt the image of these overseas baseball players and Taiwan's baseball
sector, he went on.</P>
      <P>At present, there are three bidders for the license to operate the sports
lottery, namely Chinatrust Commercial Bank, Taipei Fubon Bank, and the Bank of

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang voiced regret Monday that the United
States has misinterpreted Taiwan's plan to hold a referendum on its U.N. bid as
a step promoting Taiwan independence or changing the status quo across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks in Managua City, capital of Nicaragua, where he is
accompanying President Chen Shui-bian on a state visit to the Central American
country, after Hong Kong-based Phoenix Star TV broadcast earlier the same day an
exclusive interview with John Negroponte, U.S. deputy secretary of state,
regarding the latest political developments in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"So when we talk about the situation in regard to Taiwan, we talk about Taiwan
in the context of a great friendship. But when it comes to this issue of a
referendum as to whether or not Taiwan join the United Nations in the name of
Taiwan, we do have great concerns, " Negroponte said.</P>
      <P>"We oppose the notion of that kind of a referendum because we see that as a step
towards the declaration -- towards a declaration of independence of Taiwan,
towards an alteration of the status quo," he added.</P>
      <P>In response, Huang said he could not figure out why Negroponte made such
remarks. Holding a referendum is a purely domestic affair, a core value of
democracy and the most democratic and peaceful way for the public to express its
opinion, he said, adding that "both Taiwan's ruling and opposition camps are in
favor of holding a referendum on Taiwan's U.N. cause."</P>
      <P>Stressing that holding such a referendum is only meant to allow the public to
directly express its desire for the country to participate in the United
Nations, Huang said the move will neither break the "four noes" pledges made by
Chen in his 2000 and 2004 inauguration speeches nor contribute to a change in
cross-strait status quo.</P>
      <P>"We regret the U.S. misinterpretation of our referendum plan, " Huang added.</P>
      <P>In the interview with Phoenix Star TV, Negroponte was also asked whether the
United States will downgrade its economic or military cooperation  with Taiwan
if Taiwan continues to push for the referendum.</P>
      <P>Negroponte replied: "I wouldn't want to get into that kind of a hypothetical
discussion at this particular time. But what I would like to emphasize is that
we believe it's important to avoid any kind of provocative steps on the part of
Taiwan."</P>

      <P>Foreign students from more than nine countries praised the Ministry of
Education's (MOE's) Mandarin learning program and shared what they have learned
in Taiwan -- in Mandarin -- in a ceremony Tuesday before returning home.</P>
      <P>"These have been the most special years of my life, " said Sascha Heusermann, a
German who spoke on behalf of the foreign students in a ceremony marking the
conclusion of the summer program. Heusermann spoke in fluent Mandarin after
spending two years in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>To promote Taiwan's Mandarin education expertise, the MOE started offering
scholarships  to interested foreign students in 2005. According to MOE
statistics,  423 university students from 10 countries arrived in Taiwan this
year to participate in the program at various local universities.</P>
      <P>Among these, 299 students from nine countries were in Taiwan for the summer
programs ranging from 21 to 55 days. The students came from countries such as
the U.S., U.K., Germany, Canada, Japan, Slovenia, Russia, Poland, Costa Rica,
Austria and Kiribati -- Taiwan's diplomatic ally in the Pacific.</P>
      <P>Without the scholarships, it would be impossible for them to come to Taiwan and
join the program, and the learning environment in Taiwan has been more than they
had hoped for, a number of students said during the ceremony.</P>
      <P>"Promoting Mandarin learning is a MOE policy, and to that end, there are 48
Taiwanese Mandarin teachers in Thailand, " said Minister of Education Tu Cheng-
sheng.</P>
      <P>Tu said he was aware that China has been the most common destination for
foreigners wanted to learn Chinese, but "from what I heard from foreign friends,
Taiwan is one of the best, if not the best, destinations as it offers
professional teachers and teaching programs and an environment friendly to
foreigners."</P>
      <P>Heusermann, 22, learned more than Mandarin in Taiwan. He also observed why most
Taiwanese have difficulties learning a foreign language.</P>
      <P>"I think most Taiwanese are afraid of making mistakes. In fact, that was the
last thing you have to worry about when learning a new language, " said
Heusermann, who planned to stay in Taiwan and major in Business Management in
National Taipei University of Technology.</P>
      <P>"As happy as I am seeing the progress our foreign friends had during the short
period of time, I think it's also time for us to take a look at the efficiency
of Taiwan's  foreign language education," Tu said.</P>

      <P>Ninety-eight students from 20 countries who are preparing to study in Taiwan
under the sponsorship of the International Cooperation and Development Fund
(ICDF) attended a specially designed orientation program Tuesday.</P>
      <P>An ICDF spokesman said the organization has arranged a series of language and
etiquette lessons as well as a cultural experience camp for the students running
from Tuesday until Sept. 6 to help them become more quickly acquainted with
Taiwan's culture and lifestyle.</P>
      <P>Their studies began with a couple of traditional etiquette lessons at National
Taiwan Normal University Tuesday, and in the coming days will include paying a
cultural education visit to the Confucius Temple to learn more about Taiwan's
culture, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>He added under the ICDF's guidance, the students will pay courteous visits to
their teachers in Taiwan and write letters to their teachers to gain
acknowledgement as their disciples, an activity which aims at allowing foreign
students to better understand the local tradition of showing respect for
teachers.</P>
      <P>During the 10-day orientation activities, the ICDF will also hold forums on
issues related to successful elements of the development of Taiwan, Taiwan's
traditional culture and the etiquette of respecting teachers, with the goal of
providing a platform for students to understand local culture and exchange their
views.</P>
      <P>Additionally, on weekends, the ICDF will also organize scenic tours around the
island for those students to allow them to experience Taiwan's beautiful
landscape and local characteristics, the spokesman added.</P>
      <P>Since 1988, the ICDF has collaborated with 13 universities in Taiwan to offer
all-English undergraduate and graduate courses and provide scholarships to
attract elite foreign students to study in Taiwan. To date, a total of 250
students from 31 countries have benefited from the program, including several

      <P>Taiwan's plan to hold a referendum on its U.N. cause is only a way of responding
to public opinion and has nothing to do with changing the country's official

      <P>Wang made the remarks after U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte said
in an exclusive interview, which was aired a day earlier on Hong Kong-based
Phoenix Star TV, that the United States opposes Taiwan's holding such a
referendum.</P>
      <P>"We oppose the notion of that kind of a referendum because we see that as a step

Taiwan's plan to hold a referendum on its U.N. bid, Wang expressed  the hope

that MOFA will continue seeking to exchange views and step up communication with
the United States on the referendum issue.</P>

Ortega.</P>
      <P>Chen said he does not oppose the idea and added that it would be a great

dual recognition model.</P>
      <P>For his part, Ortega said he is aware of Taiwan's resolve to hold a referendum
on its U.N. bid in March next year and that Nicaragua will respond and adopt
measures pending the result of the referendum.</P>
      <P>As a diplomatic ally of Taiwan, Nicaragua will not interfere in Taiwan's plan to
hold a referendum, which Ortega said is a domestic issue.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Nicaragua would cut ties with Taiwan in exchange for setting up

winning the presidential election that he would maintain ties with Taiwan and
that China cannot attach any conditions if it seeks to establish formal links

      <P>Maintaining diplomatic ties with Taiwan is Nicaragua's current policy, Ortega
said and he called for dual recognition to deal with Taiwan and China. Nicaragua
will work toward this objective, he added.</P>

generation technology and indsutry, INER Director-General Lin Li-fu said Monday.</P>
      <P>Knowing that the Kaohsiung  county government  has invited enterprises in the
solar energy industry to invest in the park, Lin visited Kaohsiung Magistrate
Yang Chiu-hsing that same day to explain the plan and solicit his support in
promoting solar power generation technology.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the institute plans to build within three years an
18,000-hectare research center in which the institute can transfer its core
technology and form inspection standards that will allow it to build an
inspection center for solar energy products in the future.</P>
      <P>Lin also suggested that the Kaohsiung county government ask for help from the
central government to build a 10 million kilowatt photovoltaic solar power
generation system in the county, and to sell generated electricity to Taiwan
Power Co. as a means of attracting investment projects and expanding the
industry's market.</P>
      <P>Lin said photovoltaic solar power generation systems have up to 30 percent
efficiency, which is much higher than the 13 percent afforded by conventional
electric power generation systems.</P>
      <P>Yang asked Kaohsiung Deputy Magistrate Yeh Nan-ming to invite enterprise owners

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's daughter Chen Hsing-yu lost a slander lawsuit against
a political commentator Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court ruled that Hu Chung-hsin, a television commentator,
had no intention of defaming Chen Hsing-yu when he disclosed  in a series of
programs in October 2005 that the president's daughter had opened a bank account
in New York to engage in suspected money laundering.</P>
      <P>Cheng Hsing-yu, a dentist, stayed in New York Sept. 12-16, 2005, to attend a
short course on dental implant techniques. Hu quoted unnamed sources as saying
that she was seen in the company of friends opening an account with a New York
bank.</P>
      <P>Money laundering was suspected as a purpose for the account, apparently because
at the time, the president and other members of the first family were dogged by
a series of corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>The court said in its written statement that two witnesses testified that their
Taiwanese friends returning from the United States saw Chen Hsing-yu opening an
account.</P>
      <P>Although the court asked the Ministry of Justice to verify whether she had
opened such an account, the ministry pointed out that it could not request U.S.
help for such investigation because opening a bank account is not a criminal
act, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Another dentist from Taiwan who attended  the same course testified that Chen
Hsing-yu skipped one afternoon class. The court said it could not be ruled out
that she might have used that opportunity to open an account.</P>
      <P>Based on these facts, the court decided that Hu could not be found guilty of
slander unless it could be ascertained that the opening of the account never
happened.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's plan to hold a referendum on its bid to join the United Nation under
the name of Taiwan is a move to protect, rather than alter, the Taiwan Strait
status quo, the country's mainland policy charter said in a press release
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) issued the statement in response to U.S.
Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte's remarks made in an interview with
Hong Kong-based Phoenix Star TV that the U.S. government opposes the notion of
Taiwan's planned referendum because it sees that as a step toward "a declaration
of independence" and toward "an alteration of the status quo."</P>
      <P>Rebutting the U.S. stance, the MAC press statement said Taiwan need not declare
independence since it is already an independent sovereign state and that the
present cross-strait status quo lies in the fact that the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait are separate, it added.</P>
      <P>As a member of the international community, the statement went on, Taiwan is
entitled to join all major international organizations. The U.N. bid referendum
plan is aimed at manifesting the common will of the people of Taiwan through a
democratic procedure and protesting China's hegemonic political apartheid
against Taiwan, the statement added.</P>
      <P>Under the guise of its peaceful unification overture, the MAC statement said,
China has actually spared no efforts to suppress Taiwan diplomatically and to
intimidate Taiwan militarily. Besides saber-rattling and economic threats,
China has deployed 1,000 ballistic missiles targeting Taiwan and has enacted its
so-called Anti-Secession Law to legalize its use of force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the MAC statement said, China is the true saboteur of the
cross-strait status quo and the real troublemaker in terms of regional stability
and international peace.</P>
      <P>Noting that the U.N. bid referendum is initiated by the private sector, the MAC
statement said both the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the main
opposition Kuomintang have come up with similar proposals and are scheduled to
hold mass parades Sept. 15 to drum up support for their referendum proposals,
respectively.</P>
      <P>The MAC statement urged the U.S. government to support Taiwan's quest for U.N.
representation and to respect Taiwan's democratic system, while avoiding being
misled by China into sending a wrong signal that could accerbate China's
suppression of democratic Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Executive Yuan Secretary-General Chen Chin-jun said the U.N. bid
referendum is a consensus of ruling and opposition parties and that the move
neither violates President Chen Shui-bian's now famous "four noes" pledge nor
alters the Taiwan Strait status quo.</P>

apply to rejoin the United Nations and join other international organizations in
a pragmatic manner.</P>
      <P>The referendum proposal was put forth for examination by the KMT's vice
presidential candidate, Vincent Siew. The proposal was seen as the party's
countermeasure against the ruling Democratic Progressive Party-initiated, more
radical referendum plan which calls for joining the U.N. under the name of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the Referendum Law, the KMT now has to collect signatures of at
least 825,359 voters in six months to make its referendum proposal eligible for
a nationwide vote to be held by the Central Election Commission.</P>
      <P>All of the eight KMT recommended members of the Executive Yuan screening
committee voted for the referendum proposal at a meeting held Tuesday afternoon,
but two members recommended by the People First Party, the KMT's ally, voted
against the proposal.</P>

      <P>Health authorities said Tuesday they had notified some 1,100 tuberculosis
patients in Taiwan that they are prohibited from traveling abroad by air.</P>
      <P>The Center for Disease Control  and Prevention  under the Cabinet-level
Department of Health disclosed that those placed under air  travel  restrictions
comprise  188  multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis patients and over 900 other
active infectious TB patients.</P>
      <P>According to Chou Chih-hao, deputy director of the center, there are 399 multi-
drug-resistant TB patients in Taiwan, of whom 188 have not yet tested negative
for the disease.</P>
      <P>He said that the more-than 1,100 TB patients on the restricted list will not be
allowed to leave Taiwan by air unless they can present documentary proof issued
by their doctors within the past week declaring that they are no longer
infectious.</P>
      <P>According to center officials, the center originally planned to publicize
related measures early next year to go with a ban on air travel for infectious
TB patients, but decided to implement the measures from Sept. 1.</P>
      <P>They said the measures need to be in place urgently after a southern Taiwan
couple -- both multi-drug-resistant TB patients -- traveled to China July 21,
causing a public health alarm and prompting health officials on both sides of
the Taiwan Strait to track them down.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China sabotaging cross-strait status quo: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 28 (CNA)
08/29/07  11:36:52
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's plan to hold a referendum on its bid to join the United Nation under
the name of Taiwan is a move to protect, rather than alter, the Taiwan Strait
status quo, the country's mainland policy charter said in a press release
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) issued the statement in response to U.S.
Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte's remarks made in an interview with
Hong Kong-based Phoenix Star TV that the U.S. government opposes the notion of
Taiwan's planned referendum because it sees that as a step toward "a declaration
of independence" and toward "an alteration of the status quo."</P>
      <P>Rebutting the U.S. stance, the MAC press statement said Taiwan need not declare
independence since it is already an independent sovereign state and that the
present cross-strait status quo lies in the fact that the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait are separate, it added.</P>
      <P>As a member of the international community, the statement went on, Taiwan is
entitled to join all major international organizations. The U.N. bid referendum
plan is aimed at manifesting the common will of the people of Taiwan through a
democratic procedure and protesting China's hegemonic political apartheid
against Taiwan, the statement added.</P>
      <P>Under the guise of its peaceful unification overture, the MAC statement said,
China has actually spared no efforts to suppress Taiwan diplomatically and to
intimidate Taiwan militarily. Besides saber-rattling and economic threats,
China has deployed 1,000 ballistic missiles targeting Taiwan and has enacted its
so-called Anti-Secession Law to legalize its use of force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the MAC statement said, China is the true saboteur of the
cross-strait status quo and the real troublemaker in terms of regional stability
and international peace.</P>
      <P>Noting that the U.N. bid referendum is initiated by the private sector, the MAC
statement said both the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the main
opposition Kuomintang have come up with similar proposals and are scheduled to
hold mass parades Sept. 15 to drum up support for their referendum proposals,
respectively.</P>
      <P>The MAC statement urged the U.S. government to support Taiwan's quest for U.N.
representation and to respect Taiwan's democratic system, while avoiding being
misled by China into sending a wrong signal that could accerbate China's
suppression of democratic Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Executive Yuan Secretary-General Chen Chin-jun said the U.N. bid
referendum is a consensus of ruling and opposition parties and that the move
neither violates President Chen Shui-bian's now famous "four noes" pledge nor
alters the Taiwan Strait status quo.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States sent a strong message to Taiwan when its deputy secretary of
state spelled out that Washington opposes Taiwan's plan to hold a referendum on
the island's bid to enter the United Nations under the name Taiwan, the
opposition Kuomintang presidential candidate said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou was referring to remarks made by U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
John Negroponte in an exclusive interview that was aired Monday on Hong Kong-
based Phoenix Star TV.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Negroponte said that "we oppose the notion of that kind of a
referendum because we see it as a step towards a declaration of independence of
Taiwan, towards an alteration of the status quo."</P>
      <P>Commenting on Negroponte's remarks, Ma said that no ranking U.S. official has
publicly criticized Taiwan's policy in such strong terms before, adding that his
words represent a strong message to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma said he does not think the Democratic Progressive Party administration's rash
and abrupt moves regarding Taiwan's U.N. bid will work.</P>
      <P>"It is wishful thinking that the United States will take whatever it is given
and that it will come to Taiwan's rescue anytime, " he said.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the KMT, which governed Taiwan between 1949-2000, will continue to
push for a referendum on the issue of the Republic of China on Taiwan bidding to
"return" to the United Nations, but with a more pragmatic approach that does not
include the issue of what name the country should use in applying for membership
in the world body.</P>
      <P>In the interview with Phoenix Star TV, Negroponte was also asked whether the
United States will downgrade its economic or military cooperation with Taiwan if
the island's government continues to push for the referendum.</P>
      <P>Negroponte replied: "I wouldn't want to get into that kind of a hypothetical
discussion at this particular time. But what I would like to emphasize is that
we believe it's important to avoid any kind of provocative steps on the part of
Taiwan."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday Nicaragua is supportive
of Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations under the name Taiwan, despite the
absence of any public statement of such a stance by the Central American
country.</P>
      <P>Speaking during an informal gathering with a group of foreign correspondents in
Nicaragua, Chen said Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega has on many occasions
expressed his support for Taiwan's U.N. bid and its push to hold a referendum on
the issue.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Ortega fully understands that the referendum promoted by the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party on joining the United Nations is different
from the one promoted by the opposition Kuomintang on "returning to" the world
body.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Ortega, as a pro-democracy fighter, is well aware of the Taiwan
people's aspiration and pursuit of democracy and that during a private meeting
between the two of them, Ortega repeatedly encouraged him to continue pushing
for the referendum and insisting on using the name Taiwan to join the United
Nations.</P>
      <P>On Ortega's remarks that his country hopes to have formal diplomatic relations
with both Taiwan and the People's Republic of China, Chen said if Nicaragua were
able to achieve the goal, it would be a big step forward.</P>
      <P>Reiterating that he does not oppose "dual recognition, " Chen said Ortega would
make a great contribution to the world that would make him deserving of a Nobel
Peace Prize if he succeeded in the effort.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that both sides of the Taiwan Strait should seek a resolution  to
their differences  based on the principles  of sovereignty, democracy, peace and
equality, calling on Beijing to accept the reality and status quo that Taiwan is
a sovereign country and respect the choice of Taiwan's 23 million people.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, goodwill, reconciliation and cooperation are crucial for the
achievement of lasting peace.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that he has extended 30 to 50 olive branches to China over the
past seven years but that regrettably, none have received a positive response
from Beijing.</P>
      <P>Noting that the main purpose of his Central America visit was to take part in
the sixth leadership summit between Taiwan and its diplomatic allies in the
region held Aug. 23 in Honduras, Chen said the summit became even more
meaningful in the wake of Costa Rica's switching of diplomatic recognition to
Beijing in June.</P>
      <P>While many are concerned that the severance of diplomatic ties between Taiwan
and Costa Rica might result in a domino effect among Taiwan's other diplomatic
allies in the region, leaders of these Central American countries reaffirmed
their support for Taiwan during the summit, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>Nicaragua was the final leg of Chen's three-nation trip which also took him to
Honduras and El Salvador. He wrapped up the visit later Tuesday and departed for
home. He was scheduled to make a short stopover in the U.S. state of Alaska en
route back to Taiwan.</P>

Foreign Trade, under pressure from certain officials and alcohol importers, is
considering allowing a "small quantity" of Chinese spirits to be imported into
Taiwan, probably to the tune of about 4-8 percent of the total amount of alcohol
consumed annually in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that three conditions would have to be met before Taiwan would
allow Chinese liquor imports -- namely that Taiwan's national security would not
be undermined, that relevant industries in Taiwan would not be adversely
affected and that the Taiwan people's health would not be compromised.</P>
      <P>The secretary-general pointed out that there are hundreds of kinds of liquor in
China and that according to reports, up to 80 percent of the liquor produced
there is bootleg, which he said could pose a health risk to consumers.</P>

      <P>The Government Information Office (GIO) will start accepting applications for
use its logo bearing the image of a whale in a tank symbolizing Taiwan's desire
to join the United Nations, in an effort to better promote the government's U.N.
bid, a GIO official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Firms that have their designs approved by the GIO and pay a royalty fee of
NT$10,000 will be authorized to use the GIO-designed logo on all their products
for a year, the official said.</P>
      <P>A T-shirt with the logo worn by GIO Minister Shieh Jhy-wei for U.N. bid
promotion activities has drawn the public's attention, prompting the GIO came up
with the idea of letting more people use the logo to facilitate the U.N.
campaign.</P>
      <P>The whale in a fishtank logo shows a humpback whale that has a similar shape to
Taiwan trying to escape from a tank that limits its space and isolates it from
outside world. The logo symbolizes Taiwan's exclusion from the United Nations
and its desire to break free of restrictions and isolation imposed on it.</P>
      <P>The GIO expressed the hope that authorized firms would use part of their profits
from products bearing the logo for social welfare so that the logo will not only
speak for Taiwan's need to join the United Nations but will also benefit

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian arrived in Anchorage, Alaska at 11:
20 a.m. Wednesday, Taipei time, for a transit stop, after concluding a three-
nation visit to Central America.</P>
      <P>Chen did not disembark the plane, receiving Raymond F. Burghardt, chairman of
the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) , on board the aircraft.</P>
      <P>According to ruling Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Tang Bi-a, who is a
member of Chen's entourage, Burghardt invited the president to disembark the
airplane, telling Chen that "many people are waiting for you down there."</P>
      <P>Tang said the president turned down the invitation and told Burghardt that the
United States has made him feel a lot of stress.</P>
      <P>The U.S. government had reportedly refused to allow Chen to stopover in any
major U.S. cities other than Anchorage or to stay overnight during his transit
stops on his Latin American trip as a way of expressing its displeasure with his
administration's plan to push for a referendum on the country's bid to join the
United Nations under the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On his first transit stop in Anchorage on Aug. 21 en route to Honduras, Chen
expressed regret with the U.S. restrictions, calling the treatment
"inconvenient, uncomfortable and indecent."</P>
      <P>His second transit stop in Anchorage lasted less than an hour. The president's
plane is scheduled to arrive at the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport at 9:
45 p.m. Wednesday, Taipei time.</P>
      <P>President Chen departed Taiwan Aug. 21 for his Central America visit to attend
the sixth leadership summit between Taiwan and its diplomatic allies in the
region. The summit was held Aug. 23 in Tegucigalpa, the capital city of
Honduras.</P>
      <P>After a four-day visit in Honduras, Chen headed to El Salvador Aug. 24, from
where he traveled to Nicaragua Aug. 26.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will be invited to take part in a ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) rally slated for Sept. 15 in Kaohsiung to promote the
country's bid to join the United Nations under the name Taiwan,  a party
official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Others to be invited include Vice President Annette Lu as well as DPP
presidential candidate Frank Hsieh and his running mate, Su Tseng-chang,
according to DPP Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the DPP's overseas branches will organize a series of activities
promoting the bid next month and that on Sept. 15, they will hold events
corresponding to the Kaohsiung rally.</P>
      <P>With the Kaohsiung rally expected to draw 500,000 participants, the global
turnout will top 1 million, Lin said.</P>
      <P>On U.S. opposition to the planned referendum on the U.N.bid, Lin said that
Taiwan "stands on the side of justice" and that with disregard for international
pressure,  the DPP will show the international community that joining the United
Nations is the common desire of the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the recent remarks by U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John
Negroponte opposing the referendum have made the DPP cling even firmer to its
resolve to promote the referendum and the U.N.bid.</P>
      <P>Lin said that while the United States claims to be the world's greatest
democratic country, Negroponte's remarks are humiliating not to Taiwan but to
America's founding spirit.</P>
      <P>Lin said it is very ridiculous that two democracies are now quarreling over the
issue of holding a referendum and allowing totalitarian China to benefit from
the fight. He urged the United States not to make any compromises to China at
the expense of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During an interview on Hong Kong-based Phoenix Star TV Monday, Negroponte said
the United States is opposed to the U.N. bid referendum  because Washington
sees it as a step "towards a declaration of independence of Taiwan" and "towards
an alteration of the status quo."</P>

      <P>The United States is restricting the progress of Taiwan's democratization by
opposing the government's plan to hold a referendum on its bid to join the
United Nations under the name of Taiwan, a ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) legislator said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Hsiao Bi-khim was referring to remarks made by U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State John Negroponte in an interview aired Monday on Hong Kong-
based Phoenix Star TV.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Negroponte said that the U.S. "opposes the notion of that kind
of a referendum because we see it as a step toward a declaration of independence
of Taiwan, toward an alteration of the status quo."</P>
      <P>Hsiao noted that holding a referendum on Taiwan's U.N. membership bid is a move
championing the will of the people.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that the United States, which has long supported Taiwan's
democratization, is drawing lines and oppressing the progress of Taiwan's
democratization when Taiwan is pushing, via peaceful and democratic means,  for
U.N.  membership aimed at expressing Taiwan's wish to participate in global
activities and make contributions to the international community, Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>According to Hsiao, Negroponte made the remarks more with the aim of getting the
message across to the Chinese leadership than speaking to the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Negroponte's "misinterpretation" or "over-interpretation"  of Taiwan's U.N. bid
referendum plan as "a step toward a declaration of independence  of Taiwan"
could also be the result of Chinese influence, Hsiao said, adding that based on
the fact that Taiwan and the United States are long-standing friends, the DPP
will continue to communicate with Washington on the issue.</P>

      <P>A group of ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers defended
Wednesday the plan to hold a referendum on the country's bid to join the United
Nations under the name Taiwan, saying that the move is aimed at demonstrating
the common will and aspiration of the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>The DPP lawmakers made the remarks after U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John
Negroponte said in a recent interview with Hong Kong-based Phoenix Star TV that
"we oppose the notion of that kind of a referendum because we see it as a step
towards a declaration of independence of Taiwan, towards an alteration of the
status quo."</P>
      <P>DPP legislative whip Wang Sing-nan said that it is not fair that the United
States opposes Taiwan's planned U.N. bid referendum, adding that the United
States should have instead criticized U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for
publicly claiming that Taiwan is part of China.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that it is important to use the referendum to demonstrate the will of
the Taiwan people and to let the world know Taiwan is an independent, sovereign
country.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator William C.T. Lai said that Negroponte's remarks show that the
United States does not understand the expectations of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The country's bid to apply for U.N. membership under the name of Taiwan is aimed
at safeguarding the rights of the Taiwan people, rather than at moving towards
Taiwan independence, Lai said.</P>
      <P>U.N. membership would ensure that Taiwan would not be annexed by China, Laid
claimed, adding that U.N. membership would protect the people of Taiwan and
dissolve the threat posed by China to peace and security in the Asia Pacific
region.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Yeh Yi-jin said that every nation has its own interests and that
it is understandable that the United States attaches greater importance to China
as it has a much bigger market than Taiwan does.</P>
      <P>However, Yeh urged the United States to realize that Taiwan also has its own
national interests and that the people of Taiwan want to use the referendum to
express their view that Taiwan should be recognized by the international
community as an independent, sovereign country.</P>

      <P>A passage stipulating that the Republic of China calendar be phased out and
replaced with the Gregorian calendar will probably be included in the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) newly drafted "normal country"
resolution, party sources said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang Tuoh, a whip of the DPP legislative caucus, said that adopting the
Gregorian calendar instead of the ROC calendar, or "Minkuo, " is more convenient
for the Taiwan people in the face of increasing globalization and would also
"allow Taiwan to be uplinked to the world."</P>
      <P>Wang appealed to the public not to "over-interpret" the calendar change
politically.</P>
      <P>The passage was not included in the DPP-drafted version of a "normal country"
resolution that is set to form a critical part of the DPP's campaign platform
for the 2008 presidential election, but after DPP Legislator Trong-rong Chai
consulted Frank Hsieh, the party's candidate, a day earlier, Hsieh reportedly
expressed no opposition to the notion that the inclusion will be put for
discussion in a DPP Central Executive Committee meeting slated for Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the inclusion will very likely be passed in Thursday's
meeting.</P>
      <P>Also commenting on the inclusion, DPP Legislator Hsu Kuo-yung said that
following the Gregorian calendar is a world trend and that it is "no big deal"
for Taiwan to do so also.</P>
      <P>The resolution calls for completion of the party's ultimate goal of changing the
nation's official name, writing a new constitution and holding a national
referendum to underline Taiwan's status as an independent sovereign state.</P>
      <P>The resolution further says that since it has become very difficult to use the
name Republic of China in the international community, the country should apply
to join the United Nations, the World Health Organization and other
international bodies in the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The resolution originally suggested that the country's title be changed to
Taiwan, that the ROC calendar be phased out and replaced with the Gregorian
calendar, that the existing five branch government system be replaced with a
three-branch one and that the special municipality designation be eradicated
from the local government hierarchy.</P>
      <P>As some DPP bigwigs, including Hsieh, questioned the plausibility of those
proposals, they were all dropped from the final version of the draft resolution
adopted Monday.</P>
      <P>The draft resolution will be submitted to the DPP Central Executive Committee
for approval at its weekly meeting Thursday and will then be put up for
endorsement by party delegates at a party congress next month, according to
Wang.</P>

      <P>Although most local retirees see Hualien as a "most desirable place" to live
after retirement thanks to its natural scenery, they still rate Kinmen County
and Taipei City as the "best place" to live based on practical considerations,
according to the results of a poll by a local magazine.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted via telephone by Common Health magazine between June 30
and July 31 among 10,225 people in 25 cities and counties to obtain information
on topics related to the best places for the elderly to live in Taiwan. The
survey was conducted according to five criteria: public safety, medical
resources, convenience, leisure and financial security.</P>
      <P>Key findings from the survey reveal that most people were looking forward to
living in Hualien after retirement, followed by Nantou and Penghu counties.
However, the popular tourist attraction scored low on public safety, leisure and
medical resources.</P>
      <P>The outlying counties of Kinmen, Penghu and Lienchiang ranked the top three
local retirement spots in terms of public safety, while the central city of
Taichung placed at the bottom of the list in this respect.</P>
      <P>The survey results also found that people are most worried about letting elderly
relatives go out by themselves in Taichung City and Kaohsiung County, while the
streets of eastern Hualien County, Taipei City and Changhua County are most
likely to make elderly people fall and more than 70 percent of drivers in Taipei
County do not give way to elderly people trying to cross the street.</P>
      <P>The southern city of Chiayi came first in terms of health resources, while the
central county of Yunlin and Taipei County scored the lowest in this respect.
Residents in Hsinchu, Chiayi and Tainan cities reported the highest level of
satisfaction  for accessibility of medical care, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Taichung County and Hsinchu City rated high on leisure, as the local governments
attach great importance to promoting leisure activities for seniors, while
Penghu and Kinmen counties scored poorly due to the lack of resources, and
Lienchiang County ranked bottom in this respect because the county government
has never set up any senior-citizen recreation centers or organizations at all.</P>

coast of Taiwan for wind turbine installations, with an estimated power
generation capacity of 300,000 kilowatts in the first stage of its "offshore
wind power development guidelines," government sources reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The project will also boost the output value of related local industries by
NT$40 billion (US$1.2 billion), they added.</P>
      <P>The official installation registration process for applicants will start Sept.

Corp. and TECO Electric &amp; Machinery Co., having shown strong interest in
bidding, according to the MOEA's Bureau of Energy.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials pointed out that the offshore wind farm locations are off the
coast between Miaoli and Taichung, off the Changpin Industrial Park in Changhua
County, near Wai San Din Alluvion in Yunlin County, off the coast between Chiayi
and Tainan, off Yilan County and around the outlying Penghu islands.</P>
      <P>Officials noted that qualified companies should complete establishment in three
years after the ministry issues operation permits, or their exclusive rights
will be canceled.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in order to boost local technology capabilities in wind power
generation and wind turbine manufacturing, they said the ministry also requires
multinational corporations allowed to join the development to both license a
certain portion of key technology to local manufacturers and cooperate with
local companies to build components in Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Seven members from the Taipei City Urban Search and Rescue Team under the Taipei
City Fire Department departed Wednesday to take part in a disaster prevention
and rescue drill in Tokyo.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin presented a flag a day earlier to the team to mark its
honor of being the first foreign rescue team to be invited by the Tokyo
metropolitan government to participate in the exercise. It is also the first
time the team has participated in an international disaster prevention and
rescue drill.</P>
      <P>Tokyo delivered the invitation via the Asian Network of Major Cities 21, a body
representing the interests of several of Asia's largest capital cities around
common themes of importance.</P>
      <P>The team's seven members and a rescue dog named Bailey, the city's best rescue
dog that has taken part in several local rescue jobs, will join the Japan drill
together.</P>
      <P>Set up Sept. 21, 2000 as Taiwan's first international rescue team certified by
America's Federal Emergency Management Agency, the team is equipped to be self-
sufficient for 72 hours in a disaster area and is able to carry out different
functions including directing, searching, rescuing, medical relief, construction
and back-up supply.</P>
      <P>Its members are all professionals and have participated in many rescue jobs
including rescues after earthquakes in Iran and El Salvador.</P>
      <P>The joint disaster rescue exercise in Japan will simulate a scenario in which
Tokyo is hit by an earthquake and the Taipei team will send out Bailey and use a
life detector to help rescue people trapped in collapsed buildings, and work
with Tokyo rescue teams on other emergency relief jobs.</P>
      <P>Hau expressed hope that the team will make use of the chance to learn from
Japanese rescue teams' efficiency, which he saw when Japanese rescuers helped
after Taiwan's 921 earthquake of 1999.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) has eliminated commemoration days marking the
dates of late President Chiang Kai-shek's birth and passing, which fall on Oct.
31 and April 5, respectively, MOI Minister Lee Yi-yang announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan approved the MOI's proposal to remove from the calendar these
two national commemoration days, which Lee said were products of Taiwan's
authoritarian era when unjust acts violating democratic values and human rights
were committed.</P>
      <P>The institution of the two commemoration days arose out of particular societal
and historical contexts, but are no longer appropriate for Taiwan given that the
current government is pursuing transitional justice for the country, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee explained that national holidays should have special meanings and be
celebrated or commemorated by all of Taiwan's people. Chiang, being a
controversial person and a pivotal figure in today's polarized views of the
nation's historical development, should not have be celebrated with national
commemoration days, Lee went on.</P>
      <P>Existing regulations stipulate that the anniversary of Chiang's passing, which
falls on April 5, be held on Tomb Sweeping Day, which falls between April 4-6
each year, Lee said, adding that the proximity of the two events wrongly creates
an impression of a relationship between the them.</P>
      <P>Lee called on all Taiwanese people and political parties to deal with problems
stemming from the previous authoritarian regime with wisdom, courage and
rationality in order to help further the cause of justice and development of
Taiwan's democracy.</P>

      <P>In recognition of the threat posed by global warming and the importance of
energy security, Taiwanese business leaders will focus on environmental issues
at the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) business summit, the
delegation said Wednesday in a press conference.</P>
      <P>Even from a purely business point of view, the impact of global warming and
energy security can no longer be overlooked and ignored, said Jeffrey Koo,
Chairman of Chinatrust Financial Holding Company, who will be leading the
Chinese Taipei business delegation to Sydney, Australia for the APEC Business
Advisory Council (ABAC) Sept. 6-7.</P>
      <P>Koo, Theodore Huang, chairman of Chinese Association of Industry and Commerce,
and Henry Kao, Vice Chairman of I-Mei Foods Company will be three top
representatives of the Taiwanese delegation, which also includes a number of
business leaders invited by the Australian government.</P>
      <P>Taipei Financial Center Corp Chairwoman Diana Chen, a delegation member, spoke
of the importance of energy in the urban setting: "Taipei 101 is like a vertical
city. I believe there are many things we can learn from broad discussions and
exchanges at the APEC summit in terms of energy management and energy
consumption saving."</P>
      <P>Taiwan businesses will help promote "Green APEC Opportunity, " the nation's
initiative this year for the APEC meeting. As Taiwan has not been doing
particularly well in controlling greenhouse gas emissions, it can contribute to
the promotion and development of environmental and energy-saving products, said
Huang Chih-peng, Director-General of Bureau of Foreign Trade.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese business leaders will also support proposals submitted by Australia,
the Asia-Pacific Network on Climate Change/Clean Development and the Global
Initiative on Forests and Climate, Huang said, adding that Taiwan will be able
to contribute with its advanced solar energy technology.</P>
      <P>In terms of the other important aspect of the meeting -- Trade and Investment
Liberalization and Facilitation (TILF) -- Taiwan's position is no different than
other member economies, which share the long term goal of finding ways and means
to establish the Free Trade Area of Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) , said David Hong,
Director General of the Chinese Taipei APEC Study Center (CTASC).</P>
      <P>The ABAC is one of a series of APEC meetings to be held in Sydney from Sept.
2-9. The meetings include Concluding Senior Officials' Meeting (CSOM), APEC
Ministerial Meeting (AMM), ABAC and the APEC economic Leaders' Meeting (AELM) --

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's referendum on U.N. bid meant to defend status quo: President</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Instead of altering the political status quo across the Taiwan Strait, the
referendum on Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations is meant to preserve and
defend it, President Chen Shui-bian said here Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen, who arrived here for a transit stop on his way back to Taiwan after a
three-state visit to Central America, was quoted by an aide as making the
remarks to Raymond Burghardt, Chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan, when
the latter greeted Chen at the airport.</P>
      <P>Lee nan-yang, chief of the Public Affairs Department of the Presidential Office,
quoted Chen as telling Burghardt that he disagreed with U.S. Deputy Secretary of
State John Negroponte, who told a Hong Kong-based TV that Washington considers
Chen's proposed referendum as an alteration in the status quo and a step towards
a declaration of independence by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee quoted Chen as saying that the referendum initiated by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party was favored by 76 percent of Taiwanese people, and opposed by
11 percent; more than 74 percent of Taiwan's people believe Taiwan is an
independent sovereign state, while 11 percent who think it is a part of China;
and 85 percent of Taiwan's people believe its territory does not include the
mainland, while 10 percent think the opposite.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the president told Burghardt that 69 percent of people in Taiwan
believe they are Taiwanese not Chinese, that this represents the majority
opinion in Taiwan, and Washington should be awake to it rather than attempting
to suppress it.</P>
      <P>A referendum on Taiwan's U.N. bid doesn't mean the country will obtain U.N.
membership immediately, but it will help Taiwan's people rally  behind  the idea
and let the world  know of Taiwan's determination to enter the United Nations,
Chen was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Since most of Taiwan's people believe that Taiwan is already an independent
sovereign state rather than a part of the People's Republic of China, there is
no necessary to declare its independence, Chen was quoted in rebutting
Negroponte's argument.</P>
      <P>Although the referendum calls for the country's U.N. membership under the name
of Taiwan it has nothing to do with changing the country's designation, Chen
argued, citing the fact that Taiwan has joined different international groups
under different names.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that Taiwan operates under the name Chinese Taipei at the
International  Olympic Committee and Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum,
and the name of the Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and
Matsu in the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, Burghardt asked Chen what Taiwan's next step would be after
the U.N. bid referendum.</P>
      <P>The president said the question should be answered by the 23 million people in
Taiwan, and Washington is in no position to discourage Taiwan's people from
pursuing the democracy America promotes around the world.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's referendum on U.N. bid meant to defend status quo: President</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Instead of altering the political status quo across the Taiwan Strait, the
referendum on Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations is meant to preserve and
defend it, President Chen Shui-bian said here Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen, who arrived here for a transit stop on his way back to Taiwan after a
three-state visit to Central America, was quoted by an aide as making the
remarks to Raymond Burghardt, Chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan, when
the latter greeted Chen at the airport.</P>
      <P>Lee nan-yang, chief of the Public Affairs Department of the Presidential Office,
quoted Chen as telling Burghardt that he disagreed with U.S. Deputy Secretary of
State John Negroponte, who told a Hong Kong-based TV that Washington considers
Chen's proposed referendum as an alteration in the status quo and a step towards
a declaration of independence by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee quoted Chen as saying that the referendum initiated by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party was favored by 76 percent of Taiwanese people, and opposed by
11 percent; more than 74 percent of Taiwan's people believe Taiwan is an
independent sovereign state, while 11 percent who think it is a part of China;
and 85 percent of Taiwan's people believe its territory does not include the
mainland, while 10 percent think the opposite.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the president told Burghardt that 69 percent of people in Taiwan
believe they are Taiwanese not Chinese, that this represents the majority
opinion in Taiwan, and Washington should be awake to it rather than attempting
to suppress it.</P>
      <P>A referendum on Taiwan's U.N. bid doesn't mean the country will obtain U.N.
membership immediately, but it will help Taiwan's people rally  behind  the idea
and let the world  know of Taiwan's determination to enter the United Nations,
Chen was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Since most of Taiwan's people believe that Taiwan is already an independent
sovereign state rather than a part of the People's Republic of China, there is
no necessary to declare its independence, Chen was quoted in rebutting
Negroponte's argument.</P>
      <P>Although the referendum calls for the country's U.N. membership under the name
of Taiwan it has nothing to do with changing the country's designation, Chen
argued, citing the fact that Taiwan has joined different international groups
under different names.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that Taiwan operates under the name Chinese Taipei at the
International  Olympic Committee and Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum,
and the name of the Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and
Matsu in the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, Burghardt asked Chen what Taiwan's next step would be after
the U.N. bid referendum.</P>
      <P>The president said the question should be answered by the 23 million people in
Taiwan, and Washington is in no position to discourage Taiwan's people from
pursuing the democracy America promotes around the world.</P>

      <P>In recognition of the threat posed by global warming and the importance of
energy security, Taiwanese business leaders will focus on environmental issues
at the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) business summit, the
delegation said Wednesday in a press conference.</P>
      <P>Even from a purely business point of view, the impact of global warming and
energy security can no longer be overlooked and ignored, said Jeffrey Koo,
Chairman of Chinatrust Financial Holding Company, who will be leading the
Chinese Taipei business delegation to Sydney, Australia for the APEC Business
Advisory Council (ABAC) Sept. 6-7.</P>
      <P>Koo, Theodore Huang, chairman of Chinese Association of Industry and Commerce,
and Henry Kao, Vice Chairman of I-Mei Foods Company will be three top
representatives of the Taiwanese delegation, which also includes a number of
business leaders invited by the Australian government.</P>
      <P>Taipei Financial Center Corp Chairwoman Diana Chen, a delegation member, spoke
of the importance of energy in the urban setting: "Taipei 101 is like a vertical
city. I believe there are many things we can learn from broad discussions and
exchanges at the APEC summit in terms of energy management and energy
consumption saving."</P>
      <P>Taiwan businesses will help promote "Green APEC Opportunity, " the nation's
initiative this year for the APEC meeting. As Taiwan has not been doing
particularly well in controlling greenhouse gas emissions, it can contribute to
the promotion and development of environmental and energy-saving products, said
Huang Chih-peng, Director-General of Bureau of Foreign Trade.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese business leaders will also support proposals submitted by Australia,
the Asia-Pacific Network on Climate Change/Clean Development and the Global
Initiative on Forests and Climate, Huang said, adding that Taiwan will be able
to contribute with its advanced solar energy technology.</P>
      <P>In terms of the other important aspect of the meeting -- Trade and Investment
Liberalization and Facilitation (TILF) -- Taiwan's position is no different than
other member economies, which share the long term goal of finding ways and means
to establish the Free Trade Area of Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) , said David Hong,
Director General of the Chinese Taipei APEC Study Center (CTASC).</P>
      <P>The ABAC is one of a series of APEC meetings to be held in Sydney from Sept.
2-9. The meetings include Concluding Senior Officials' Meeting (CSOM), APEC
Ministerial Meeting (AMM), ABAC and the APEC economic Leaders' Meeting (AELM) --
the highlight of the annual meeting of 21 member economies.</P>

      <P>More than 30 Americans will soon begin voluntarily working as English teachers
in an English Village in Taoyuan County, which will open in September, a charity
foundation in charge of the program announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>A total of 34 voluntary teachers, ranging from four to 60 years-old, will teach
at the English Village during the next 12 months. The situational language
teaching method will be applied in the village, which has different classrooms,
said Morgan Sun, the chief executive officer of the King Car Education
Foundation.</P>
      <P>The teachers volunteered to come to Taiwan through a Christian organization in
the U.S. which has been in close relationship with the foundation.</P>
      <P>"It feels good to be able to serve another country by teaching English. I would
also like my family to learn about Chinese and Taiwanese cultures to better
understand what this world looks like, " said Roy Lyons, who brought his wife
and daughters to Taiwan. Lyons also taught English in China during 2002-2005.</P>
      <P>"It [teaching] is a lot of hard work, but it feels good to make friends with
Taiwanese college students and children, " said Nathan Straub, who arrived in
Taiwan seven weeks ago and has been teaching in English summer camps in Hsinchu
and Hualien.</P>
      <P>For Wesley Dudley, Taiwan is both a familiar and special country. Dudley is
making his second trip to Taiwan as he has taught English in mountainous area in
Nantou County a couple of years ago. Taiwan is also where he met his wife,

      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) has eliminated commemoration days marking the
dates of late President Chiang Kai-shek's birth and passing, which fall on Oct.
31 and April 5, respectively, MOI Minister Lee Yi-yang announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan approved the MOI's proposal to remove from the calendar these
two national commemoration days, which Lee said were products of Taiwan's
authoritarian era when unjust acts violating democratic values and human rights
were committed.</P>
      <P>The institution of the two commemoration days arose out of particular societal
and historical contexts, but are no longer appropriate for Taiwan given that the
current government is pursuing transitional justice for the country, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee explained that national holidays should have special meanings and be
celebrated or commemorated by all of Taiwan's people. Chiang, being a
controversial person and a pivotal figure in today's polarized views of the
nation's historical development, should not have be celebrated with national
commemoration days, Lee went on.</P>
      <P>Existing regulations stipulate that the anniversary of Chiang's passing, which
falls on April 5, be held on Tomb Sweeping Day, which falls between April 4-6
each year, Lee said, adding that the proximity of the two events wrongly creates
an impression of a relationship between the them.</P>
      <P>Lee called on all Taiwanese people and political parties to deal with problems
stemming from the previous authoritarian regime with wisdom, courage and
rationality in order to help further the cause of justice and development of
Taiwan's democracy.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has reiterated that Taiwan's planned referendum on its
U.N. membership bid will not change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks upon his arrival at Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport late Wednesday after concluding a nine-day trip to Central America,
which included transit stops in the U.S. state of Alaska.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the referendum issue was raised during his meeting with U.S.
representatives during the transit stops, and he told them that Taiwan is
already a sovereign country and has no need to declare independence.</P>
      <P>Chen said with the status quo being that there is "one country on each side of
the Taiwan Strait," the referendum on whether to use the name Taiwan to join the
United Nations will not cause any changes to the situation.</P>
      <P>Instead, the referendum will help safeguard the cross-strait status quo and
prevent China from changing it unilaterally, he said.</P>
      <P>Reiterating that the holding of referendums is a basic human right and a way of
deepening Taiwan's democracy, Chen said the right of Taiwan's 23 million people
should not be restricted or denied just because of China's opposition and
suppression.</P>
      <P>The country's efforts to gain membership  in international organizations  such
as the United  Nations  and World  Health Organization under the name Taiwan are
aimed at upholding the rights of the people and have nothing to do with changing
the country's official name, the president said.</P>
      <P>The U.S. government, which does not support membership for Taiwan in
international organizations that require statehood, has expressed its opposition
to the U.N. bid referendum on the grounds that it would increase tensions in the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In the latest such statement, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte
said during an interview on Hong Kong-based Phoenix Star TV Monday that the
United States is opposed to the referendum because Washington sees it as a step
"towards a declaration of independence of Taiwan" and "towards an alteration of
the status quo."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian voiced his protest Thursday against a recent change to
the country's designation by the organizers of the 2007 Venice Film Festival
under pressure from China, saying that not even cultural events are spared from
Beijing's relentless political interference.</P>
      <P>Chen addressed the issue in the latest edition of his online newsletter,
referring to the use of "Taiwan, China" to replace "Taiwan" as the producing
country of four films participating in the festival.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that similar situations occurred in the past at the Berlin
International Film Festival and the Cannes Film Festival, Chen said the
Government Information Office has lodged a protest with the organizers in this
latest case in the hope that a correction will be made as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>As China is using every possible means to isolate Taiwan and prevent it from
upholding its sovereignty, the government has been working very hard to
strenghten its relations with the international community, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Besides these efforts, the president also pointed to two recent examples of
Taiwan shining in the international arena, despite China's "brutal and
uncivilized" treatment.</P>
      <P>The first example was the excellent performances by the Taipei First Girls' High
School marching  band at the just-concluded Edinburgh International Festival
held in the United Kingdom, with the band members wearing uniforms on which the
national flag was displayed, Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to the president, the performances gave international audiences the
chance to see the beautiful Taiwan and allowed the name Taiwan to spread around
the world through coverage of the event by local and international media.</P>
      <P>The second example mentioned by the president was the Taiwan team's display of
national pride at the 2007 Microsoft Imagine Cup. Although the members of the
team, which finished second in the short film category of the competition, were
prohibited from carrying the country's flag while receiving their medals, they
all wore slippers with the colors of the flag and with the letters "TW" stitched
on them to let the world know they are from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said these examples prove that the country's citizens can help Taiwan stand
out on the world stage by using their creativity.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's communication equipment production has recently recorded its first
recession since 2002, with the output value for the first half of this year
registering a decline of 5.4 percent over the same period of 2006, according to
statistics released Thursday by a non-profit research center.</P>
      <P>The statistics, compiled by the Industrial Economic and Knowledge Center (IEK)
under the Industry Technology Research Institute, show that the communication
equipment manufacturing sector's production totalled NT$317.5 billion (US$9.58
billion) for the period.</P>
      <P>IEK analyst Wu Yu-ju said the industry enjoyed significant growth in output in
2002 due to fast-growing demand for wireless products. The trend contributed to
a steady expansion of the sector over the past five years, she added.</P>
      <P>In 2006, it flourished again, thanks to a boom in mobile phone OEM orders, as
well as the impact of the Taiwan-based BenQ Group's takeover of the mobile phone
department of Germeny-based Siemens, one of the world's leading manufacturers in
electrical engineering and electronics, Wu said.</P>
      <P>However, the good days failed to last, Wu went on, saying that the output of
mobile phone OEM factories fell by 36.1 percent in the first half of this year
compared with the same period of 2006 -- from 67.77 million units to 43.16
million units.</P>
      <P>The mobile phone sector generated an output value of NT$95.2 billion between
January and June, down from NT$159.5 billion for the same period of 2006,
according to Wu.</P>
      <P>In Contrast, the global positioning system (GPS) production industry posted
booming growth in the first six months of the year, with the output registering
a rise of 69.7 percent over the same period of 2006 to reach NT$71.8 billion.</P>

      <P>Interior Minister Lee Yi-yang rebutted Thursday opposition criticism of his
ministry's move to scrap two commemoration days related to the late President
Chiang Kai-shek.</P>
      <P>Describing  the  commemoration  days  as  vestiges  of authoritarianism, Lee
said they should never have existed in the first place and that their
abolishment is long overdue.</P>
      <P>Lee announced Wednesday the abolition of the commemoration days marking Chiang's

      <P>According to Lee, no democratic countries in the world have a day designated to
commemorate an individual unless he is the country's founding father or has made
a major contribution to the country.</P>
      <P>Noting that "half of the people in Taiwan disapprove of Chiang, " Lee added that
the government should not continue coercing the public into honoring him,
especially in light of his role in the 228 Incident of 1947 in which thousands
of people were massacred by KMT troops while suppressing a rebellion against KMT
rule in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the Ministry of the Interior has any plans to scrap the
commemoration days marking the birth and passing of Republic of China founding
father Sun Yat-sen, Lee said the government has no intention of doing this, as
those commemoration days are not controversial.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Cabinet spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey said removing the remaining  vestiges
of  Chiang  is  part  of  the  country's "disenchantment" process to achieve
transitional justice and that in the next step, the Democratic Progressive Party
administration will eliminate all traces of the past KMT rule.</P>
      <P>Although martial law has long been lifted in Taiwan, many people are still
living in the dark authoritarian era, Shieh said, adding that only by removing
the "phantom" of Chiang will they "let the sunshine in."</P>

    <HEADLINE>CDC to make diagnosis of suspected Tainan CJD case</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 30 (CNA)
08/30/07  18:07:41
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Center for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of Health is expected
to announce early next month whether a suspected case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (CJD) reported in Tainan, southern Taiwan is indeed CJD -- the human
derivation of mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>According to CDC Deputy Director-General Chou Chih-hao, CDC specialists met in
March to discuss the case -- reported by the National Cheng Kung University
(NCKU) Hospital -- and based on limited information, made a preliminarily
diagnosis that the patient was not suffering from CJD.</P>
      <P>The United Daily News, however, reported Thursday that the same patient, who has
developed classic symptoms of CJD over the past 10 months and is now in a
vegetative state, could be suffering from a new variant of CJD (nv-CJD), as she
had received placenta injections for a long time before checking into the NCKU
Hospital for treatment.</P>
      <P>The CDC decided to call in its specialists Sept. 8, saying that it had received
limited information about the patient's medical history before and would like to
re-examine the case after the NCKU hospital provides it with more details of the
patient.</P>
      <P>So far, the causes of classic CJD infection are unknown and there is no exact
cure to it, but classic CJD has always been around. It is very rare,  striking
about one person per million every year worldwide. Mostly the cases are
"sporadic, " meaning they have no known cause. A few have been linked to organ
transplants from infected people, or to genetics. Many victims who died from
classic CJD did not contract it from contaminated meat. Classic CJD strikes
people 50 or older, progresses rapidly and has only physical symptoms.</P>
      <P>To date, a total of 175 classic CJD cases have been reported in Taiwan, with
about a dozen cases being reported each year, according to Chou.</P>
      <P>New variant CJD, however, is a human disease of the central nervous system that
was first diagnosed in the United Kingdom in 1995. Scientists have tentatively
linked the disease to eating meat products from cattle infected with bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly called mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>Except for a few cases in other European nations with BSE, nv-CJD has been found
almost exclusively in the United Kingdom. It strikes younger people, often
begins with psychiatric symptoms and progresses slowly.</P>
      <P>Both diseases are brain-wasting,  eventually destroying the victims'  motor
skills  and coordination,  and both  show  a characteristic spongelike
appearance in the victims' brains when autopsied.  Both  are  fatal  and
transmissible  spongiform encephalopathy.</P>
      <P>CDC officials preliminarily excluded the possibility that the Tainan patient --
whose age is an important factor but was not disclosed -- is an nv CJD patient
on the grounds that placenta injections are banned in Taiwan and that there is
nothing in the literature to indicate that any CJD cases have been caused by
placenta injections.</P>

      <P>Illegal drug laboratories are gradually moving from China to Taiwan, posing a
threat to the nation's social order, Coast Guard Administration (CGA) Minister
Wang Jin-wang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The phenomenon has become more evident as investigation and law enforcement on
illegal drug production are getting stricter in China, Wang said.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, CGA and the Bureau of Investigation under the Ministry of
Justice discovered a drug factory in Tainan County Aug. 26, and found 800 kg of
ketamine worth NT$600 million (US$18.09 million), the biggest single haul of
ketamine in Taiwan's history.</P>
      <P>The CGA discovered 500 kg of smuggled amphetamine and ketamine last year, about
half of which was found hidden under the bottom of cars shipped in containers,
and half of which was packaged as health food and discovered at the Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Wang said the black market for illegal drugs in Taiwan is likely to expand
because many violators of laws regarding class A and class B drugs were released
after implementation of the commutation statute in July. The police are taking
notice as to whether released drug violators will increase demand for drugs and
cause price hikes, Wang added.</P>
      <P>The CGA, the police and the Investigation Bureau will work harder on clampdowns
on drug use and smuggling, Wang said.</P>

      <P>Lu was wanting to find out what people there need to improve their livelihoods
and was briefed to this end by Chen Hsueh-sheng, magistrate of Lienchiang
County, which covers Matsu.</P>
      <P>During the briefing, Chen and Matsu Legislator Tsao Erh-chung called for the
central government to open the doors wider for the existing direct shipping
links between Matsu and Mawei in China's Fujien Province, commonly known as
"mini three-links."</P>
      <P>Tsao asked the MAC to relax restrictions on political policy to allow an
expansion of the links and suggested that the government open its doors for
people living on Taiwan proper to travel to China via Kinmen and Matsu. At
present, only residents of the two islands and some Taiwan business people
operating in China enjoy the right to travel between their homeland and China's
Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>In response, Lu proposed expanding the "mini three-links" to the "medium three-

      <P>Presidential Office officials rebutted Thursday a media report that construction
of an airport on the Taiwan-held islet of Taiping in the Nansha Islands near the
South China Sea has resumed and is being rushed so that the facility's
inauguration might be overseen by President Chen Shui-bian in December this
year.</P>
      <P>The officials ridiculed the United Daily Evening News allegation as completely
off-base for having misleadingly connected the building of the airport to the
president's itinerary.</P>
      <P>They confirmed that the Taiping airport is being built with funds appropriated
from the Executive Yuan Second Reserve Fund and that the construction must be
completed by the end of this year in accordance with the usage of the fund.</P>
      <P>According to the evening news report, former Defense Minister Lee Jye stealthily
appropriated the funds for the project's budget during his tenure, but the
budget was killed later by the Legislative Yuan, thus the construction was
suspended.</P>
      <P>Recently, the Ministry of National Defense quietly resumed construction and
ordered that the construction be fast-tracked so that President Chen could

      <P>Taiwan researchers have proved during rodent testing that a widely used cancer
drug is also effective against Alzheimer's disease, with clinical experiments
set to begin in October and a new drug for the brain disease expected to be
marketed in three to five years, Academia Sinica sources reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>The drug -- granulocyte-colony stimulating factor or G-CSF -- has been used in
cancer cases for years to offset the side-effects of chemotherapy, with a
boosting effect to human blood cell regeneration through stimulating the release
of hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow.</P>
      <P>Biologists  at Academia  Sinica --  Taiwan's  top research institution -- have
found that the stem cells released can not only replenish the damaged blood
cells but can also refresh the impaired areas in body organs like the heart and
brain.</P>
      <P>In a research paper published in multiple renowned science journals, Shen Che-
kun and Tsai Kuen-jer -- both from Academia Sinica's Institute of Molecular
Biology -- state that the cognitive and memory functions of Alzheimer's disease-
infected laboratory mice have recovered to near-normal status after being
treated with G-CSF, indicating that the stem cells have replaced the
dysfunctional neurocytes to overcome the injuries caused by the Alzheimer's.</P>
      <P>Shen noted that conventional drug treatments for Alzheimer's mainly focus on
maintaining the status of brain function, without the ability to restore them to
full performance. While some stem-cell therapies show promising signs in
function restoration, they require injections or operations on the damaged areas
of the brain.</P>
      <P>Unlike other stem-cell therapies, the G-CSF method is non- intrusive, requiring
only injections in the abdomen or blood vessels to activate the effect, Shen
pointed out, adding that the motivated stem cells will then move to the brain
and repair the target area.</P>

      <P>An innovative drug for diabetic ulcers, developed by a Taiwanese biomedical

Thursday.</P>
      <P>If approved, they noted, it will mark a milestone in the nation's pharmaceutical
research and development.</P>
      <P>The drug was developed by the government-funded Development Center for
Biotechnology (DCB) and has been transferred to a local pharmaceutical company,
Microbio Biotechnology, to continue the R&amp;D process.</P>
      <P>All ingredients of the combo drug are extracted from natural herbs, and possess
distinct curative effects for diabetic wounds but show none of the side-effects
seen previously,  making it an improvement on the only drug available on the
market, according to the DCB.</P>
      <P>Diabetic patients sometime suffer from persisting wounds which may become ulcers
capable of disturbing or undermining the immune system if left untreated.</P>
      <P>To date, Taiwan's biomedical industry has spent most of its R&amp;D funds on
improving existing drugs, and there has been no previous case of developing a
wholly new drug -- a fact that makes this new drug even more remarkable, noted
researchers on the both side.</P>
      <P>If the drug is permitted to undergo human testing, it will be the first time
that a Taiwanese-made drug has passed FDA reviews, and only the second time that

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei-based Chinese Federation of Labor announced Thursday that a mass
rally will be staged by workers next month in protest against rising national
health insurance premiums and a poor pension program for laborers.</P>
      <P>Federation President Chen Chieh said that the July 1 rise in the country's
minimum wage was a form of "belated justice, " but denounced the administration
for allowing the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) to raise the health
insurance premiums, beginning Aug. 1.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said, a planned labor pension reform will probably reduce the
laborers' pension payments to a level lower than that to which retired laborers
are now entitled.</P>
      <P>These two developments have prompted the federation to organize a mass rally
Sept. 18, when some 20,000 workers will march to the Executive Yuan, the
Legislative Yuan and the Department of Health to vent their anger and make their
position known, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Responding to the federation's planned demonstration,  BNHI President  Chu Tze-

the premiums in accordance with the law.</P>
      <P>Chu appealed to the labor federation to reconsider before launching the mass
rally, which he said would be costly for society.</P>
      <P>Also commenting on the federation's demonstration plan, Council of Labor Affairs

      <P>The Taipei District Court sentenced an accomplice of a former Taipei city
councilor involved in extortion to six years in prison Thursday.</P>
      <P>The court also ruled that Hung Cheng-hsiung,  owner of a construction company
who helped former Taipei city councilor Lo Tsung-sheng extort money from several
other construction companies, will be stripped of his citizenship rights for two
years after he has finished serving his prison term.</P>
      <P>The court said that it will pass sentence on Lo and another accomplice, Cheng
Hai-yuan, at a later date.</P>
      <P>Lo, a two-term Taipei city councilor who served until December 2006, was charged
in June last year with extorting money from four construction companies in the
2002-2004 period.</P>
      <P>Although Lo has been released from custody on NT$800,000 bail and is barred him
from leaving the country, he has never appeared in court proceedings. He has
been placed on the nation's most-wanted list.</P>
      <P>Public prosecutors in Taipei are seeking a 17-year sentence for Lo, charged with
forcing four construction companies to "donate" some NT$4 million to ensure that
he would keep quiet about their unlawful dumping of construction debris.</P>
      <P>The victims claimed that Lo and his aides had used their access to files at the
Maintenance  Office of the city government's Department of Public Works to
obtain information  about which construction  companies  were found  to have
illegally  dumped construction wastes.</P>
      <P>Lo and his aides would then allegedly demand money from the companies and
threaten to blow the whistle on them if they did not cooperate.</P>
      <P>According to the four construction companies, Lo would accept the cash and
pretend that he "borrowed" the money by writing a check to each of them, but the
checks would always bounce.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party stripped Lo of his party membership in
July 2006. He sought a third city council term but lost the election in December
last year.</P>

      <P>The red-clad anti-graft protestors who launched a campaign Sept. 9 last year to
oust scandal-ridden President  Chen Shui-bian  will gather again in front of the
Presidential Office, an executive of the campaign said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Yao Li-ming, a deputy commander of the campaign told reporters that the
protesters will be back on Ketegalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential
Office Sept. 9 to keep the anti-graft movement alive.</P>
      <P>He said the anti-graft leaders will not mobilize the masses for a large-scale
march in Taipei's streets,  but will only hold a candle-light vigil.</P>
      <P>Yao said the anti-graft headquarters have obtained permission from Taipei police
authorities to hold the vigil.</P>
      <P>"We will announce plans during the vigil for further protest actions on the Oct.
10 National Day," he said.</P>
      <P>Yao confirmed that Shih Ming-teh, former chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party who initiated the anti-graft campaign last year, will attend
the vigil.</P>
      <P>He also said the campaign headquarters will donate whatever balance is left from
last year's donations to under-privileged groups, and that the campaign leaders
will try to muster new funds needed for future anti-graft activities.</P>
      <P>Shih, who served as DPP chairman between 1994 and 1996 before leaving the party
in 2000, launched the anti-graft campaign on Sept. 9 last year with a round-the-
clock  sit-in  in front of the Presidential Office following a street march with
an estimated 200,000 people.</P>
      <P>After a massive street march by an estimated 750,000 protesters on Sept. 15
failed to bring the desired response from the president, anti-graft campaign
leaders targeted the Presidential Office on the Double Ten National Day in an
attempt to humiliate Chen and his family, who were dogged by a series of
corruption and embezzlement scandals.</P>

      <P>Defense spending will take the lion's share of the government's budget for 2008,
government officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The officials made the remarks after the Executive Yuan referred the 2008 draft
budget bill to the Legislative Yuan earlier in the day for deliberation and
approval.</P>
      <P>According to the Executive Yuan-proposed  budget,  military spending is
projected at NT$341.1 billion, up NT$48.1 billion from this year's level. The
amount accounts for 20.1 percent of the government's projected expenditure from
the coming year, which also constitutes the largest share of the budget pie.</P>
      <P>Defense spending takes the second largest budget share for 2007, lagging behind
expenditure for culture, education, science and technology. Due to increases in
arms procurement funds, military spending will top the spending list next year,
the officials said.</P>
      <P>According to the draft budget bill, the government's revenues are projected at
NT$1.61 trillion, compared to the projected expenditures of NT$1.69 trillion. It
will mark the first time in nine years that the government's budget gap will be
narrowed below NT$100 billion, the officials added.</P>

military control, Wo said, adding that its residents, numbering about 50,
continue to live under conditions equal to those during the period of martial
law.</P>
      <P>Lo said that the Defense Ministry has persistently prevented Taiwan residents
from heading to Wuchiu for tourism by citing the military restrictions, bad
sailing conditions and lack of space for ferry service facilities on the islet.</P>
      <P>Lo suggested that Wuchiu -- located about 20 nautical miles away from Fujian
Province's Meizhou Island -- be opened to tourists as "another Kueishan Islet"
for sightseeing  visits without prior approval from the Defense Ministry.
Kueishan Islet, located off the eastern county of Yilan, was opened to tourists
in 2000.</P>
      <P>The news conference was held prior to an unprecedented three-day, two-night
sightseeing excursion to Wuchiu organized by the two private groups. Some 100
people from Taiwan proper are expected to take part in the excursion scheduled
for Aug. 31-Sept. 2.</P>
      <P>Wuchiu, under the administrative jurisdiction of Kinmen, is Taiwan's smallest
rural township, with a population of around 350, including 300 military
personnel.</P>
      <P>There is no regular ferry service between Kinmen and Wuchiu. A former elementary
school on the islet has been closed for several years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's U.N. bid unrelated to independence: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  31 (CNA)
08/31/07  13:41:24
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) reiterated Thursday that Taiwan's bid to
gain membership in the United Nations has nothing to do with seeking so-called
"de jure independence, " because Taiwan is already a sovereign independent
country.</P>
      <P>The MOFA dismissed as "misleading" China's claim that U.N. Resolution 2758 of
1971, which replaced the Republic of China on Taiwan with the People's Republic
of China as the sole representative of China in the United Nations, recognizes
Taiwan as part of China.</P>
      <P>The MOFA made the clarification in a written statement, in response to a letter
dated Aug. 17 that was written by China's U.N. permanent representative Wang
Guangya to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.</P>
      <P>Referring to a request by some of Taiwan's diplomatic allies that Taiwan's U.N.
membership application be considered in the upcoming session of the General
Assembly, Wang described the move as "a blatant attempt to clamor for and create
Taiwan independence."</P>
      <P>Wang claimed resolution 2758 "is based on a self-evident fact that China is an
integrated country and that Taiwan is a part of China."</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the resolution resolved the question of China's
representation in the United Nations "once and for all, politically, legally and
in terms of procedures."</P>
      <P>However, the MOFA argued in the statement that the resolution did not define the
relationship between Taiwan and China nor did it empower the People's Republic
of China to represent Taiwan in the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The MOFA said Taiwan has no intention of challenging the PRC's representation in
the United Nations, noting that the ROC has since 1991 no longer claimed to
represent the whole of China and that the bid that the country has been
promoting since 1993 to participate in the United Nations does not involve the
question of "representation of China."</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which maintains diplomatic relations with 24 countries around the world,
is undoubtedly a sovereign country independent of China and is entitled to the
right to become a full member of the world body, the MOFA said.</P>
      <P>According to the MOFA, a consensus is lacking among U.N. member states on the
relationship between Taiwan and China, and the United Nations should stop
claiming that it follows a "one China" policy.</P>
      <P>Of all 169 countries maintaining diplomatic relations with China, only fewer
than 60 recognize or support the notion of Taiwan as a part of the PRC, while
others simply "acknowledge" China's position or do not take a stance at all, the
MOFA said.</P>
      <P>On Wang's accusation that Taiwan is attempting to change the cross-strait status
quo that "both Taiwan and the mainland belong to one and the same China" and
working towards "de jure Taiwan independence" by pushing for a referendum on the
U.N. bid, the MOFA reiterated that Taiwan is a sovereign independent country
known officially as the Republic of China and has no need to declare
independence.</P>
      <P>The MOFA noted that Taiwan and China have been ruled separately and have been
independent of each other since 1949, a situation which remains the status quo
to this day.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian sent a membership application letter on behalf of
Taiwan to Ban July 19, but the letter was returned based on Resolution 2758.
Chen sent a second letter July 31 to the U.N. secretary-general urging him to
reconsider his decision, but the letter was also returned.</P>
      <P>On Aug. 13, 15 of Taiwan's diplomatic allies submitted a motion to the General
Assembly requesting that the Security Council process Taiwan's membership
application according to established procedures, in the hope that the motion can
be included on the agenda of the 62nd regular session of the General Assembly
set to open Sept. 18 in New York.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will help retrieve bad loans from nations
that have severed formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, MOFA spokesman Wang
Chien-yeh said Friday.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry will not sit idly by at a time when Taiwan banking
institutions or the non-profit International Cooperation and Development Fund
(ICDF) are having trouble retrieving loans granted to countries that later
severed formal ties with Taiwan, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The spokesman was referring to a China Times report Friday that quoted the
Legislative Yuan Budget Center as indicating that Taiwan had incurred losses to
the tune of NT$3.3 billion (US$100 million) from bad loans to nations that have
severed formal diplomatic relations with the country.</P>
      <P>Wang said that it is possible to retrieve the bad loans as all the loans were
made via Taiwan banks or the ICDF in contracts with clear terms.</P>
      <P>Citing the example of Guiana, he said that after it severed diplomatic ties with
Taiwan, the ICDF filed lawsuits in the United States against the government of
Guiana, and all the money that Taiwan had loaned the South American  country
was eventually retrieved.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lashed out at the Ministry of National Defense
Friday for not having consulted environmental protection authorities prior to
resuming construction of an airport on the Taiwan-held Taiping Island in the
South China Sea.</P>
      <P>Kuo Su-chun, a whip of the KMT legislative caucus, said that Taiping Island,
part of the Nansha Islands, better known as the Spratlys, is an important
military outpost of the Republic of China but that it is also home to green
turtles -- a protected species -- whose situation is an important barometer of
the state of the environment.</P>
      <P>Kuo said it is acceptable that the Defense Ministry seeks to build an airport on
Taiping based on strategic considerations, but the ministry should not have
rushed the process just to complete construction in time for a planned
inauguration ceremony to be presided over by President Chen Shui-bian in
December as alleged in a report in the local United Daily News the day before.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the Defense Ministry -- in defiance of the fact that a
relevant budget plan had been killed by the Legislative Yuan -- has stealthily
resumed the building of the airport with NT$715 million (US$21.67 million) in
funds appropriated from the Executive Yuan Second Reserve Fund and has ordered
that the construction be fast-tracked to meet the December deadline.</P>
      <P>Also commenting on the report, KMT Legislator Shuai Hua-min, who had served as
president of the College of Defense Management at the National Defense
University 1997-2001, said it is justifiable for the Defense Ministry to build
an airport on the islet located at the southernmost point of the Republic of
China's territory for strategic and defense purposes.</P>
      <P>However, Shuai called for the Defense Ministry to act in a manner that befits a
ministerial-level agency, rather than proceed with the plan in a stealthy
manner.</P>

      <P>The issue of Taiwan's push for a referendum on its U.N. bid is expected to be
discussed during upcoming talks between U.S. President George W. Bush and
Chinese President Hu Jintao at next month's meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum, a White House official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Dennis Wilder, senior director for Asian affairs of the National Security
Council, said he can "almost guarantee" that Hu will raise the topic with Bush,
noting that he has "almost never been to a meeting with Chinese officials where
the subject of Taiwan didn't come up."</P>
      <P>"Hu usually wants a recommitment by the United States to three communiques and
to our standing one China policy. I'm sure the president will be willing to give
him that, " Wilder said during a press briefing  on Bush's planned attendance
at the informal leadership summit of APEC slated for Sept. 8-9 in Sydney,
Australia.</P>
      <P>Wilder said the United States is very supportive of Taiwan on many  fronts,
such  as  its  participation  in  international organizations, including APEC
and the World Health Organization.</P>
      <P>However, Wilder said this does not include membership in the United Nations,
which requires statehood, because "Taiwan, or the Republic of China, is not at
this point a state in the international community."</P>
      <P>"The position of the United States government is that the ROC, Republic of
China, is an issue undecided, and it has been left undecided, as you know, for
many, many years," he said.</P>
      <P>Wilder said it is "perplexing" to Washington as to why Taiwan thinks it would be
useful to hold a referendum on the U.N. issue.</P>
      <P>According to Wilder, Taiwan is not going to be able to join the United Nations
under current circumstances, and the move only "adds a degree of tension" to
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wilder urged China to work to lower the tensions across the Taiwan
Strait, in light of the large-scale military build-up opposite Taiwan, and reach
out to the duly elected leaders in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Over the past few months, U.S. government officials have on many occasions
expressed opposition to Taiwan's plan to hold a referendum on the U.N. bid on
the grounds that it would increase tensions in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In an interview on Hong Kong-based Phoenix Star TV Monday, U.S. Deputy Secretary
of State John Negroponte said the United States is opposed to the referendum
because Washington sees it as a step "towards a declaration of independence of
Taiwan" and "towards an alteration of the status quo."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Gregorian calendar clause added to DPP 'normal country' resolution</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A clause calling for the adoption of the Gregorian calendar in Taiwan and the
dropping of the Republic of China's "Minkuo" calendar has been included in the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) newly passed "normal country"
resolution, party sources said Friday.</P>
      <P>The clause was adopted after a last-ditch  effort by DPP Legislator Trong Chai
who concurrently serves as convener of a nine-member task force authorized to
draft the resolution, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Chai insisted on incorporating the clause to signify the party's efforts at
linking Taiwan to more closely to the international community at a meeting of
the DPP Central Executive Committee Thursday, during which the "normal country"
resolution was passed.</P>
      <P>Except for the addition of the "calendar" clause, the text of the final
resolution was same as the draft version completed Monday.</P>
      <P>The resolution, which is set to become a critical part of the party's platform
for the 2008 presidential election, was finalized after more than three months
of extensive discussions.</P>
      <P>The resolution states that the country's official name should be rectified and
that a new constitution should be written, but it stops short of specifying a
timetable or what national title should be adopted.</P>
      <P>Instead, the resolution states that as it has become very difficult to use the
name Republic of China in the international community, the country should apply
to join the United Nations, the World Health Organization and other
international bodies under the name "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The resolution also stresses the need for the nation to hold a referendum at the
proper time to underscore Taiwan's independent statehood.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun said the resolution will be put forth for approval at
the party's national congress slated for Sept. 30.</P>
      <P>The resolution identifies China's hegemony and the remnants of the Kuomintang's
(KMT's) 55 years of authoritarian rule as major threats Taiwan faces in its
struggle for normalization.</P>
      <P>According to the resolution, Beijing's "one China" principle and its Anti-
Secession Law against Taiwan threaten Taiwan's sovereignty and security and have
caused "abnormalities" in Taiwan's foreign relations.</P>
      <P>The resolution  also identifies  the KMT's huge amount of "ill-gotten" party
assets and the remnants of its authoritarian "party-state" system as threats to
Taiwan's democratic development, as they hinder normal inter-party competition.</P>
      <P>It further notes that the obsolescence of the ROC constitutional framework has
led to the country's "constitutional abnormalities" since the DPP won the
presidency in 2000.</P>
      <P>According  to the  resolution,  the  previous  government's suppression of
Taiwanese culture has caused confusion among the citizens of the country
concerning national identity, and the preferential treatment given to certain
special groups has sabotaged social unity and led to "abnormalities in social
justice."</P>
      <P>To resolve all these abnormalities, the resolution calls for reinforcement of
Taiwan-centric education in school curriculums, promotion of transitional
justice, elimination of inequalities in resources distribution, acceleration of
judicial reform and retrieval of the KMT's "ill-gotten" party assets.</P>
      <P>The DPP headquarters-drafted version originally suggested that the country's
title be changed to "Taiwan, " the existing "five branch" government system be
replaced by a "three-branch" system, and the special municipality  designation
in the local government hierarchy be scrapped.</P>
      <P>As some DPP heavyweights, including Frank Hsieh, the party's candidate in the
2008 presidential  election,  questioned  the feasibility of these proposals
being implemented, the proposals were all dropped from the draft resolution
adopted Monday.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Scholars discussing transitional justice agreed in a seminar Thursday that while
transitional justice should have arisen out of a non-partisan campaign,
electoral politics and the media have become necessary means of pursuing those
ends.</P>
      <P>"Transitional justice in Taiwan should have been built on a non-partisan
consensus because justice is a universal value. But more often than not, it has
became a partisan movement because the related bills failed to pass through the
Legislative Yuan, " said Ku Chung-hwa, a professor at National Chengchi
University (NCU).</P>
      <P>Rather than operating along ideal lines, the movement has become "an electoral
mobilization tool, " said Ku in a seminar titled "Complete  Justice,  Better
Democracy"  and  organized  by the pro-independence Taiwan Thinktank.</P>
      <P>It is easy to understand why the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has done all
it could to block bills and oppose the campaign, because the movement was
directed to the KMT, said Hsu Yung-ming, a research fellow at Academia Sinica.</P>
      <P>Transitional justice in Taiwan cannot be achieved without a legislative
majority, which means the people of Taiwan have to voice their opinion in the
elections, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Media bias is another of the major reasons that transitional justice has been so
difficult to implement. What Taiwan needs, said Lilian Wang, a journalism
professor at NCU, is a public forum and mass media outlets to publicize the
truth so that people might understand their "real history."</P>

      <P>A majority of 85 percent of Taiwanese manufacturing firms responding to a recent
survey are optimistic about business prospects for the second half of the year,
a local think tank researcher said Friday.</P>
      <P>The survey of Taiwanese firms was conducted by the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research (TIER) in July to explore their views of future business prospects,
said Chen Miao, a TIER researcher.</P>
      <P>Citing  survey  results,  Chen stated that the number  of manufacturing firms
optimistic about business prospects in July rose 18.8 percent from June, while
firms expressing pessimism about the future decreased 12.5 percent over the same
period.</P>
      <P>However, the survey also shows a decrease in the number of firms of all types
expressing optimism about business prospects in the second half year, sliding to
37.7 percent from 42.8 in June. Firms anticipating that business will remain
constant was unchanged at 47 percent, while those which are pessimistic about
the second half of the year increased to 15.0 percent from 10.7 percent the
month before.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, higher prices for raw materials has caused some of the
uncertainty, but increasing demands on the export market, and the manufacturing
industry's upcoming boom season have offset much of those concerns.</P>
      <P>The manufacturing industry's business climate index for July reached 119.24, up
3.18 points over the June figure, setting a new high for the year to date, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the business climate index for the service industry in July stood at
120.06 points, up 1.09 points from the June figure, Chen said, adding that the
figure shows firms have confidence in Taiwan's future economic development.</P>
      <P>Pointing to specific lines of business in the service sector, Chen said that
banks are currently being more conservative due to the impact of the subprime
loan crisis,  while travel agents are pessimistic about future development owing
to a decrease in the number of group tours in the second half year. However, he
also noted that other sectors, such as marine transport, are upbeat as they are
entering their high seasons.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) was urged Friday to lodge a protest
against France over an incident in which two Taiwan citizens were stripped,
searched and detained for two days simply because they were holding two
different kinds of Taiwanese passports.</P>
      <P>Kuo Su-chun, a whip of the opposition Kuomintang legislative caucus, said the
Foreign Ministry should protest the humiliating treatment endured by the two
men, who work at a Taipei County-based high-tech company, at the main Paris
airport two weeks ago, and demand an open apology from the French government
over the incident.</P>
      <P>Kuo was referring to a report in Thursday's edition of the Apple Daily that the
two staff members were on their way from Paris to London for business when they
were detained by authorities at Charles de Gaulle International Airport on
suspicion of being terrorists because they were holding two different Taiwan
passports -- one copy bearing the name "Taiwan" on the cover, the other without.</P>
      <P>The two men were handed over by British Airways workers to French police at the
airport, after which they were stripped to their underpants, searched, and
transported to a detention room where they sat for two days and two nights
before being released, according to the report.</P>
      <P>According to the report, after the two men informed their head office in Taipei
County of the incident, company authorities called the MOFA for assistance, only
to be asked by MOFA officials why the two men didn't file for help online in
"real time?"</P>
      <P>Responding to the Apple Daily report, MOFA officials said that no Taiwan
passport holder had been detained in foreign countries before for holding new or
old copies of Taiwanese passports.</P>
      <P>To date, the officials added, neither the British Airways nor the French
authorities has given any reasons why the two men were detained and questioned.
They only informed Taiwan's representative office in France of the procedures
for the victims to file complaints, the officials said, adding that outbound
travelers are welcome to contact the ministry for emergency relief or
assistance.</P>

      <P>Wilhelm Josef Sebastian, chairman of the German-Taiwan Friendship Group of the

      <P>The group's 61 members are drawn from various German political parties.
Sebastian, a member of the Christian Democratic Union, visited Taiwan in
February this year at the head of a delegation from the group.</P>
      <P>In the letter delivered Aug. 21, Sebastian emphasized that Taiwan is an
independent nation with its own people, land, government, and ability to develop

is a country working hard to strengthen democracy and participate positively in

      <P>According to Sebastian, it was sad that Taiwan -- a peaceful and democratic
country that has contributed to regional peace -- has been crowded out of the

      <P>The Republic of China is certainly a country from the viewpoint of the ROC, Ma
Ying-jeou, the presidential candidate of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), said
Friday.</P>
      <P>There are more than 20 members of the international community that recognize the
ROC as a country, and it is regarded as a "foreign country" according to the law
of the United States, said Ma, who holds a doctorate in law from Harvard
University.</P>
      <P>Ma made the comment in response to media inquiries on public remarks made a day
earlier in Washington, D.C. by Dennis Wilder, senior director for Asian affairs
of White House's National Security Council, regarding Taiwan's bid for
membership in the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Wilder pointed out that membership in the United Nations requires statehood and
said that "Taiwan, or the Republic of China, is not at this point a state in the
international community."</P>
      <P>"The position of the United States government is that the [status of the] ROC is
an issue undecided and has been left undecided... for many years," he said.</P>
      <P>Ma said that since the United States severed diplomatic ties with the ROC in
1979, it has held fast to this viewpoint.</P>
      <P>Ma said the U.S. is concerned that Taiwan's plan to hold a referendum on its
U.N. bid under the name of Taiwan will result in a unilateral change to the
cross-Taiwan Strait status quo, triggering a cross-strait crisis.</P>
      <P>However, a KMT proposal to hold a referendum on "the Republic of China's return
to the United Nations" will not raise such concerns because the ROC was one of
the founders of the international organization,  Ma said,  predicting that such
a "flexible and pragmatic" proposal will not lead to cross-strait tension.</P>

      <P>The minister of education has not instructed local schools to shorten breaks
between classes from the current 10 minutes to five minutes as reported by a
local newspaper, a Ministry of Education (MOE) official said Friday.</P>
      <P>MOE Secretary-General  Chuang Kuo-jung was referring  to a front-page report
carried in the United Daily News that day claiming that Minister of Education Tu
Chen-sheng had demanded that local schools cut short class breaks to make time
for an exercise promotion program known as the "cheerful life" plan.</P>
      <P>The report immediately drew criticism from opposition lawmakers, who claimed
that the program is designed at the expense of the needs of schoolgirls, who "by
nature" require longer toilet breaks than boys.</P>
      <P>In response, Chuang said the newspaper report was false.</P>
      <P>"The minister did not ask local elementary or junior high schools to shorten
class breaks to five minutes. The minister only suggested that school
authorities more flexibly adjust the break between the second and third classes
to give students a longer time to exercise," Chuang explained.</P>
      <P>Given that many Taiwanese students are in poor physical condition due to a lack
of exercise, the MOE is hopeful that school-based physical activities can be
extended. Everyday, every student should spend at least 30 minutes stretching
and exercising at school, Chuang said, noting this is the reasoning behind the
MOE's proposal.</P>
      <P>However, every school has the right to work out its own schedule for recommended
activities,  based on their individual campus environments, he added.</P>
      <P>As for the false news report, Chuang said the MOE is considering taking legal
action against the media outlet.</P>

      <P>Results of recent research programs at National Cheng Kung University show that
extracts from the toona sinensis tree, also known as Chinese mahogany, can
improve male fertility.</P>
      <P>Chang Sue-joan, professor and chairwoman of the Department of Life sciences of
Cheng Kung University, told a seminar Friday that a series of research programs
conducted under her leadership between 2003 and 2006 have shown that toona
sinensis extracts can minimize the harm caused by oxidative stress to human
sperm.</P>
      <P>Some of her research results were published in 2005 at the 18th International
Congress of Nutrition in Durban, South Africa, and published in the South
African Journal of Clinical Nutrition.</P>
      <P>Chang said the World Health Organization has provided evidence showing an
overall reduction in male fertility during the past few decades. She added that
the decreasing quality of semen and declining sperm count is due partly to long-
term exposure to oxidative stress.</P>
      <P>She said that toona sinensis could be the answer to the issue of deteriorating
sperm count.</P>
      <P>Tender shoots of the toona sinensis have long been used by Chinese as a
traditional leafy vegetable or crushed as a spice to add flavor to bean curd and
noodles.</P>
      <P>Results of other research in Taiwan have shown that the effects of toona
sinensis extract might improve the quality of spermatozoa of mice and increase
their sperm motility.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) has defended  a construction  project to
expand the main road on Taiwan-held Taiping Island in the Nansha, or Spratly,
islands in the South China Sea, saying that the road is needed for sustainable
development and as an emergency runway.</P>
      <P>The ministry made the remarks in a press release issued Friday after an evening
newspaper said the day before that former Defense Minister Lee Jye secretly
allocated funds for the project to construct an airport during his tenure. The
construction was later suspended as the budget was killed by the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>Recently, the MND began to send troops to the Nansha islands for a planned
resumption of the project slated to kick off Sept. 25, so that the construction
can be completed before President Chen Shui-bian travels to the outlying islet
to inaugurate the airport in December, the report claimed.</P>
      <P>However, the ministry said in the press release that it has obtained the needed
budget for the road expansion project by law, has won the approval of the
Executive Yuan and has notified the Legislative Yuan of the project.</P>
      <P>The islet's main road will be expanded to 1,150 meters in length and 30 meters
in width, the press release said, adding that the expanded road will be used by
people and vehicle at normal times, and by aircraft for emergency landings and
takeoffs during humanitarian relief missions.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the MND said it has taken measures to protect the environment while
planning the project, although the Environmental Protection Administration
required no environmental impact assessment for the project.</P>
      <P>Under the measures, the MND said it will avoid areas of flourishing  trees  and
will transplant  trees  prior  to the construction. The construction area will
be located on either side of the main road where there are fewer trees, the
ministry said, adding that the construction area will only account for 10
percent of the islet's total land area.</P>
      <P>In addition, the MND said the construction troops will have strict orders not to
damage primitive trees or sandy areas frequented by sea turtles.</P>
      <P>It added that it will use gravel transported from Taiwan proper rather than from
the islet itself and that it will transport discarded goods to Taiwan proper
instead of leaving them on the islet, according to the press release.</P>

      <P>"The  unique  event  probably  appropriately  reflects  the characteristics of
the Vietnamese as they are always laid back and easy-going, " according to Su.</P>
      <P>Three dance troupes -- Minh-hai, Datviet and Quoc Vuong -- that consist of
Vietnamese workers will also perform.</P>
      <P>Nguyen Ba Hai, head of the Vietnam Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei's
Division of Labor Administration,  encouraged  all Vietnamese workers and
families with Vietnamese spouses to take part in the event so that children from
these families can better understand the culture of their mothers' home country,
Nguyen said.</P>
      <P>The event is a part of the 2007 Southeast Asian Cultural Activities series
organized by the Migrant Workers' Cultural Center (MWCC) , an organization under
the city government. In addition to Vietnam, the MWCC also organizes similar
cultural events for workers from Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines every
year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President nominates grand justice as new Judicial Yuan head</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 31 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has nominated Lai Ing-jaw and Hsieh Tsay-chuan, both of
whom are grand justices, as the new Judicial Yuan president and vice president,
respectively, a Presidential Office spokesman confirmed Friday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman made the announcement after Hsiao Tzu-chung, deputy director-
general of the First Bureau under the Presidential Office, referred the
nomination list to the Legislative Yuan for approval earlier the same day.</P>
      <P>The nomination list also includes eight candidates for seats on the Council of
Grand Justices -- Yeh Sai-ying, Lin Hsi-yao, Che hi-ming, Tsai Ching-yu, Liu
Hsing-yi, Lee Chen-shan, Hsu Chih-hsiung and Yeh Jiunn-rong.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the legislature is expected to review and exercise its power
of consent or refusal on the president-proposed nomination list when its new
session opens next month.</P>
      <P>Lai, 61, has a Ph.D. in law from Harvard University. He served as deputy Taiwan
governor, vice premier and a senior adviser to the president before becoming a
grand justice in 2003.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, 63, graduated from National Taiwan University's Department of Law and has
a master's degree in law from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. He
has served as the Taichung District Court president, director of the civil
affairs department of the Judicial Yuan and director of the Training Institute
for Judges and Prosecutors. He has been a grand justice since 2003.</P>
      <P>Among the 15 seats on the Council of Grand Justices for which Chen nominated
candidates in 2003, eight of them, including the post of president and vice
president of the Judicial Yuan, are for four-year terms, while the remainder are
for eight-year terms. However, as former Judicial Yuan Vice President Cheng
Chung-mo resigned and Yang Jen-shou left to serve as head of the Commission on
the Disciplinary Sanctions of Functionaries, there are currently only 13 grand
justices.</P>
      <P>Judicial Yuan President Weng Yueh-sheng, who concurrently serves as a grand
justice, as well as five other grand justices, namely Lin Yung-mo, Wang He-
hsiung, Yu Hsueh-ming, Tseng You-tien and Liao Yi-nan, will see their terms
expire at the end of September.</P>
      <P>This is why the president has to put forward a list of eight grand justice
nominees to fill the vacancies.</P>
      <P>Other incumbent grand justices, including Lai, Hsu Pi-hu, Peng Feng-chih, Lin
Tze-yi, Hsu Tsung-li, Hsieh Tsay-chuan and Hsu Yu-hsiu, will see their terms
expire in September 2011.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No allies could make Taiwan `2nd Hong Kong': president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 31 (CNA)
08/31/07  23:45:05
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that if Taiwan were to abandon all of its
diplomatic allies for the sake of saving money, it could become another Hong
Kong to be annexed by China.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in a political talk show broadcast on Sanlih cable TV in
response to criticism by some opposition figures of his recent visit to Central
America.</P>
      <P>During his three-nation Central American tour that took him to Honduras, El
Salvador and Nicaragua, Chen promised development aid to the three allies,
drawing accusations that he was engaging in checkbook diplomacy. Some critics
suggested that Taiwan should drop all of its allies to save money</P>
      <P>Describing that suggestion as "narrow-minded, " Chen noted that Taiwan used to
be an aid recipient. "Since we have emerged as an economic  powerhouse,  we
should  be  more  magnanimous  and forward-looking in extending a helping hand
to other countries in need, " he said, adding that if Taiwan were to lose all
its allies, it could become a province of China.</P>
      <P>On the U.S. concern about Taiwan's plan to hold a referendum on its bid to join
the United Nations under the name Taiwan, Chen said he attaches great importance
to the U.S. concern.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen said Taiwan has its own national interests and value that
cannot be compromised. It would be an irony to the spirit of the U.S. founding
fathers if Taiwan were to be asked to forsake its pursuit of democratic values,
he added.</P>
      <P>In an interview with Hong Kong-based Phoenix Star TV Monday, U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State John Negroponte said the U.S. government opposes Taiwan's
U.N. membership referendum plan because it views that kind of referendum as a
move toward declaration of independence of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan is already an independent sovereign state, Chen said
Taiwan need not declare independence. As referendum is a basic human right, Chen
argued that Taiwan should not be required to give up its referendum plan.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's democratic development should not be subject to any unreasonable
restriction. We don't want caged democracy. With more than 70 percent of Taiwan
people backing the quest for a U.N. seat under the name of Taiwan, I'm not in a
position to block the holding of a referendum to have our people's voice heard
in the international community and their common aspiration known to the world, "
Chen added.</P>
