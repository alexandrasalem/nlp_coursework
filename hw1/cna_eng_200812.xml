      <P>Deputy Chief Executive Officer of the Philippines Pag-IBIG Fund Jaime A. Fabiana
said Sunday in Taipei that overseas Philippine workers who dream of owning a
decent and affordable house can finally realize their dreams.</P>
      <P>"The government is looking at helping overseas Filipino workers (OFW) in Taiwan
to buy houses in the Philippines, " said Fabiana. To this end, "we are holding
the first overseas Housing Fair in Taiwan. Later we will hold other Housing
Fairs in Dubai and London."</P>
      <P>The fair, held at the Dominican School in Taipei, was the first of its kind
organized outside the Philippines by the Manila Economic and Cultural Office
(MECO) and the Pag-IBIG Fund.</P>
      <P>According to information released by the MECO, the Housing Fair is a coordinated
effort by government agencies such as the Pag-IBIG Fund, the Landbank of the
Philippines (LBP) , Philippine Health Insurance Corp. and the Philippine Labor
and Employment Office.</P>
      <P>Pag-IBIG Fund is one of the Philippines government's leading housing agencies.</P>
      <P>The event in Taipei also featured booths set up by the LBP with the aim of
providing an inexpensive service to workers in Taiwan who send remittances to
the Philippines.</P>
      <P>Fabiana said that many overseas Filipino workers (OFW) dream of building a new
house for their loved ones. "We hope to help make their dream come true by
hosting this Housing Fair in Taipei, " said Fabiana. "We provide housing loans
at rates as low as 6%."</P>
      <P>"I think the interest rates for the housing loans are quite low," said Silva
Moonyen Ortiz, a Filipina who has been working in Taiwan for three years.</P>
      <P>The fair attracted many OFWs residing in areas of northern Taiwan such as
Taoyuan, Jhongli, Hsinchu and Keelung.</P>
      <P>According to the MECO, there are 85,000 Filipinos in Taiwan and all of them are
trying hard to provide for their families in the Philippines.</P>
      <P>The housing fair will serve as venue for OFWs and developers to meet and will
also facilitate arrangements for the housing projects to be tailor-made to the
OFWs' needs and requirements, the MECO said.</P>
      <P>Most of the housing projects will be affordable and OFWs at the housing fair
will be able to chose from among projects in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao, it
added.</P>
      <P>Pag-ibig Fund is the Philippines government's Home Development Mutual Fund that
was created in 1978 to offer savings schemes and housing loan packages to
Filipinos. It includes an overseas program, which offers Filipino overseas
contract workers, immigrants and naturalized citizens an opportunity to save for
the future and to access a housing loan of as much as 2 million Philippines
pesos.</P>
      <P>Philippine citizens working overseas can join the Pag-IBIG overseas program by
first applying for membership and paying the required monthly contributions.</P>
      <P>Last month, Pag-IBIG officials flew to Taiwan to promote the fund's housing
projects among OFWs in Taipei, Taichung in central Taiwan, and the southern port
city of Kaohsiung. The Pag-IBIG Fund delegation  visited factories and
dormitories  where they gave presentations on the programs and services being
offered to OFWs.</P>
      <P>In the absence of formal diplomatic ties, MECO is the de-facto embassy of the
Republic of Philippines in Taiwan, handling trade and cultural exchanges between
the two countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Passengers from grounded Taiwan ship return home safely</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Nov.  30 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Fifteen passengers who were onboard a Taiwanese supply ship that ran aground off
the northern coast of the Philippines several days ago during a storm returned
safely to the southern port city of Kaohsiung Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to two post-graduate students of National Taiwan Ocean University
(NTOU) who were aboard the You Tai No. 1, the ship ran aground Friday on rocks
off the coast of Ilocos Norte in the northern Philippines while it was on its
way back to Taiwan from a supply trip to the Nansha (Spratly) islands in the
South China Sea.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung-based vessel was carrying 15 passengers and 14 crew members, all
of whom were were taken in custody for questioning by the Philippine security
authorities.</P>
      <P>They were held Friday and Saturday on suspicion of attempting to smuggle goods
or to illegally enter Philippines territory, as many of them failed to produce
passports, according to the students.</P>
      <P>Through the efforts of the Taiwan representative office in the Philippines, the
29 Taiwanese, including NTOU faculty, officials from the Coast Guard
Administration, Republic of China Air Force officers and telecommunications
engineers, were released late Saturday.</P>
      <P>The 15 passengers then took a flight from Manila back to Kaohsiung Sunday, while
the 14 crew members remained in the northern Philippines port of Laoag waiting
for repairs to the supply ship, which had been towed to Laoag with the
assistance of a Taiwanese cement company.</P>
      <P>The students said that the ship ran onto the rocks probably because the captain
was trying to avoid the storm and he was not familiar with the waters in that
area. This led to the You Tai No. 1 unwittingly entering Philippine territorial
waters, they said.</P>
      <P>The NTOU lecturers and students onboard the ship were returning from the Nansha
island archipelago in the South China Sea -- located about 1,600 km from the
southernmost tip of Republic of China territory -- where they were conducting
research on rare and endangered green turtles.</P>
      <P>The ROC has stationed personnel on Taiping island, the largest coral reef in the
Nansha Islands, since the 1940s, and they rely on supplies from Taiwan for their
operations and daily necessities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan, China to cooperate on air traffic control</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Top civil aviation officials of Taiwan and China will meet in Shanghai in early
December to sign an agreement on air traffic control,  Taiwan's Ministry of
Transportation  and Communication (MOTC) confirmed Sunday.</P>
      <P>The agreement will be inked between Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration
and the Air Traffic Management Bureau of the Civil Aviation Administration of
China (CAAC), paving the way for technical cooperation in managing a new direct
flight route between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The new flight route was made possible through one of four pacts signed in
Taipei in early November between Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of Taiwan's semi-
official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), and his Chinese counterpart --
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) President Chen
Yunlin, to allow more direct flights between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>The other three pacts will allow direct shipping links and postal services and
the establishment of a food safety mechanism between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Civil aviation authorities on both sides of the strait have reportedly already
worked out details on future cooperation in managing the flight route.</P>
      <P>Sources at the MOTC said the two sides have agreed on a code name -- SULEM --
for the route's connection point between the flight information regions of
Taiwan and China in order to divide air control responsibilities.</P>
      <P>MOTC officials also disclosed that Song Dexing, director of the Water Transport
Department of China's Ministry of Transport, is scheduled to lead a Chinese
delegation to visit Taiwan in early December.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, Song will meet with Ying Chen-pong, director general
of the MOTC's Department of Aviation and Navigation, to discuss a range of
issues, including shipping capabilities, search and rescue work in maritime
disasters, ship inspection, pollution control and mediation of maritime
disputes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's homosexual males vulnerable to HIV: study</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A survey on homosexual males in Taiwan shows that 90 percent of the recorded 164
HIV-positive men are gay, and that 46 percent had delayed seeing a doctor until
they knew they were affected by HIV, according to the results released Sunday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the Center for Disease Control under the Cabinet-
level Department of Health. The results were released on the eve of World AIDS
Day, which is observed on Dec. 1. to heighten awareness of the AIDS pandemic
caused by the spread of HIV infection.</P>
      <P>Lo Yi-chun, a medical doctor at the center, disclosed that some of the gay men
did not see a doctor until more than six months after an unsafe sexual
encounter, or had waited until they developed symptoms of AIDS before seeking
treatment.</P>
      <P>He said the 46 percent of HIV-positive homosexual males who delayed seeing their
doctors is a higher rate compared with other countries, where the rates range
between 24 percent and 45 percent.</P>
      <P>A previous study by National Taiwan University Hospital showed that delay in
seeking diagnosis or treatment of HIV could increase the chances of death by 20
percent to 30 percent.</P>
      <P>According to Lo, in his interviews with HIV-positive patients, many admitted
that they did not think they would be so unlucky as to contract HIV in a casual
sexual encounter because they had only a limited number of sexual partners.</P>
      <P>Statistics on new HIV cases in Taiwan compiled by the Center for Disease Control
showed that homosexual males accounted for 46 percent of the 728 cases certified
as HIV-positive between January and May this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President vows to address train service problems in eastern Taiwan</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Nov.  30 (CNA)
11/30/08  21:10:09
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou pledged Sunday to alleviate public transport service in
scenic eastern Taiwan where train tickets for connections to the bustling
western part of the country are often extremely hard to obtain.</P>
      <P>Ma made the promise while riding on a Taroko tilting train bound for the eastern
county of Hualien on a community outreach tour.</P>
      <P>"Providing convenient and comprehensive  train services for eastern Taiwan
residents is one of the government's priority goals and the first target is to
alleviate the dire shortage of Taroko train tickets," Ma told reporters covering
his Hualien tour.</P>
      <P>The eastern counties of Hualien and Taitung are known for their rich tourist
resources,  particularly  their beautiful mountain sceneries and Pacific Ocean
landscapes,  but transport service connecting the region with the more developed
western part of Taiwan has remained inconvenient.</P>
      <P>The existing Suhua Highway is vulnerable to landslides during the monsoon season
and a controversial plan to build a new freeway linking Hualien with its
neighboring northeastern county of Yilan has remained on the drawing board for
quite some time due to strong opposition from environmentalists.</P>
      <P>In working to improve the eastern Taiwan transportation system, Ma said,
priority will be given to expanding train services.</P>
      <P>"First of all, the current problem in obtaining Taroko train tickets should be
wiped out, " Ma said, adding that this promise should be fulfilled during his
first presidential term.</P>
      <P>The Taroko tilting trains, which have an operating speed of 130 km/h, have
helped cut the travel time from Taipei to Hualien from three hours to two since
they were launched last year.</P>
      <P>However, at present, travelers are forced to wait up to 90 minutes for a Taipei-
Hualien Taroko train, which has prompted complaints from many eastern Taiwan
residents about the difficulty in obtaining tickets to go home on major national
holidays or festivals.</P>
      <P>Ma said the Taiwan Railway Administration has come up with a plan to purchase 48
new Taroko trains to meet transportation demands.</P>
      <P>"When all of these new trains are put into service by the end of 2011, the
waiting time will be shortened to 40 minutes," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he said, the government has decided to complete its eastern Taiwan
transportation system improvement plan within five years instead of the
originally projected seven years.</P>
      <P>According to the plan, various train stations in eastern Taiwan will get a
facelift or be largely expanded to meet market demand, Ma said, adding that the
plan has been included in an economic stimulus package to spur the country's
economic growth by expanding domestic demand.</P>
      <P>To galvanize eco-tourism in eastern Taiwan, Ma said, the TRA is also
spearheading a "train plus cycling" travel plan by collaborating with local
governments to build more cycling paths around the island.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Ma addressed a ceremony for the inauguration of a new cycling
path near Liyutan Reservoir in Hualien County's Shoufong township, saying the
path's opening is congruent with the government's policy and a prevalent social
fad.</P>
      <P>With the cycling population increasing steadily, Ma said, the government will
flesh out a practical cycling policy to offer safe, comfortable and convenient
facilities for cycling enthusiasts.</P>
      <P>After cycling along the trail, Ma lauded it as a world-class cycling  path  that
boasts  beautiful  mountain  scenery  and eco-resources-rich river landscape. He
suggested the Hualien county government advertise the new path on domestic and
foreign tourism publications to attract tourists from home and abroad.</P>

      <P>A series of landslides at a landfill retaining wall construction site in the
central city of Taichung left one volunteer  firefighter  dead,  one worker
missing and two firefighters injured, city officials said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The first landslide occurred at around 9 a.m., burying a construction worker
identified as Wu Cheng-wei. The search for Wu is still underway as of the press
time.</P>
      <P>The Taichung city government's Fire Department dispatched a rescue team
immediately after it received a distress call.</P>
      <P>While Fire Department staff and volunteers were busy searching for the buried
worker, there was a second landslide which buried Fu Chia-sen, a volunteer
firefighter.</P>
      <P>Fu's colleagues then rushed to mount a new search mission. At around 1 p.m., two
Fire Department staff members, identified as Lin Hung-yi and Chen Chieh-chi,
spotted part of Fu's clothing and tried to pull him out.</P>
      <P>However, another landslide hit, causing the pair to sink into the soft dirt. Lin
Hung-yi was rescued first and was sent to the nearby Taichung Veterans General
Hospital, where it was found that he had sustained only slight injuries.</P>
      <P>Chen Chieh-chi, who was buried in dirt from his chest down, was not rescued
until around 5 p.m. He complained of acute pain in his legs and was sent to
hospital for examination and treatment of his injuries.</P>
      <P>The deceased volunteer firefighter, Fu Chia-sen, was the scion of a wealthy
family, according to city government sources. Fu first joined the volunteer
firefighting service more than 10 years ago and was cited last year as a role
model.</P>
      <P>Lin Pao-ching, the contractor on the retaining wall reinforcement project, said
the landslides were believed to have been caused by water seeping from ready
mixed concrete used in the construction of the wall.</P>
      <P>On the project, 19 10-meter-high culverts are being built beneath the landfill.
Because of the softness of soil in the region, land excavation is being done

      <P>Minister of the Interior Liao Liou-yi on Sunday paid a visit to the family of Fu
Chia-sen, a volunteer firefighter who was killed during a search and rescue
mission at a landfill construction site in the central city of Taichung earlier

      <P>Fu, the scion of a wealth family, was pronounced death on arrival when he was
finally pulled out of dirt from landslides at the landfill retaining wall
construction site in suburban Taichung, city officials said.</P>
      <P>Taichung Deputy Mayor Hsiao Jia-chi, who accompanied Liao on the visit to Fu's
home, said that although Fu was a volunteer, the city government will offer the
best possible compensation for Fu's family in terms of regulations applicable to
formal Fire Department staff members because he sacrificed his life in his
efforts to rescue others.</P>
      <P>Fu first joined the volunteer firefighting service more than 10 years ago and
was cited last year as a role model.</P>
      <P>Liao and Hsiao also visited Taichung Veterans General Hospital to extend their

      <P>The number of Chinese tourist arrivals is not expected to break the 100,000 mark
this year, given the less-tha-ideal figure recorded for the first 11 months of
the year, immigration officials said Sunday.</P>
      <P>In 2006 when Chinese citizens  were only allowed to make sightseeing trips to
Taiwan via a third place, the number of Chinese tourist arrivals once set a
record of more than 100,000, according to government  statistics.</P>
      <P>Following a thawing in bilateral ties since the inauguration of China-friendly
Kuomintang government in May this year, the two sides came to terms on full
opening of Taiwan for Chinese tourists and on launch of direct cross-strait
charter flights to facilitate civilian exchanges.</P>
      <P>However, the number of Chinese tourists has not increased as significantly as
expected.</P>
      <P>Even in October when Chinese citizens  enjoyed a weeklong holiday, the number of
Chinese tourist arrivals only totaled 11,797, far below the projected target.</P>
      <P>According   to  tallies  compiled   by  the  National Immigration Agency, about
68,000 Chinese citizens visited Taiwan in the first 10 months of this year. If
the daily number of Chinese tourist arrivals was estimated at 400 in November,
the total number for the first 11 months will be about 80,000, falling far short
of the target, immigration officials said.</P>
      <P>Amid the lingering  global financial  turmoil and economic recession, the
officials said, the number of Chinese arrivals is not expected to increase
substantially in December.</P>

      <P>The body of a worker who was buried in dirt from landslides at a landfill
construction site in the central city of Taichung for more than 10 hours was
recovered late Sunday after many twists and turns, city officials said.</P>
      <P>Wu Cheng-wei showed no vital signs when his body was pulled out of dirt at 11
p.m., and he was pronounced death on arrival (DOA) after being rushed to nearby
Taichung Veterans General Hospital.</P>
      <P>Wu was the first to be buried in a series of landslides at the suburban site
where a landfill retaining wall reinforcement project was underway, but he was
the last to be recovered from the dirt because subsequent landslides claimed
another victim and injured two municipal Fire Department staff members.</P>
      <P>Wu was buried when the first landslide hit at around 9 a.m. Sunday.</P>
      <P>The city government's Fire Department dispatched a rescue team immediately after

      <P>Minister of the Interior Liao Liou-yi on Sunday paid a visit to the family of Fu
Chia-sen, a volunteer firefighter who was killed during a search and rescue
mission at a landfill construction site in the central city of Taichung earlier
that day, to express his condolences.</P>
      <P>Fu, the scion of a wealth family, was pronounced death on arrival when he was
finally pulled out of dirt from landslides at the landfill retaining wall
construction site in suburban Taichung, city officials said.</P>
      <P>Taichung Deputy Mayor Hsiao Jia-chi, who accompanied Liao on the visit to Fu's
home, said that although Fu was a volunteer, the city government will offer the
best possible compensation for Fu's family in terms of regulations applicable to
formal Fire Department staff members because he sacrificed his life in his
efforts to rescue others.</P>
      <P>Fu first joined the volunteer firefighting service more than 10 years ago and
was cited last year as a role model.</P>
      <P>Liao and Hsiao also visited Taichung Veterans General Hospital to extend their
regards to two Fire Department staff members who were injured in the landslides
at the construction site.</P>
      <P>A series  of landslides  at the landfill  retaining  wall construction site left
one volunteer firefighter dead, one worker missing and two firefighters injured.</P>
      <P>The first landslide occurred at around 9 a.m., burying a construction worker
identified as Wu Cheng-wei. The search for Wu is still underway as of the press

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of Chinese tourist arrivals is not expected to break the 100,000 mark
this year, given the less-tha-ideal figure recorded for the first 11 months of
the year, immigration officials said Sunday.</P>
      <P>In 2006 when Chinese citizens  were only allowed to make sightseeing trips to
Taiwan via a third place, the number of Chinese tourist arrivals once set a
record of more than 100,000, according to government  statistics.</P>
      <P>Following a thawing in bilateral ties since the inauguration of China-friendly
Kuomintang government in May this year, the two sides came to terms on full
opening of Taiwan for Chinese tourists and on launch of direct cross-strait
charter flights to facilitate civilian exchanges.</P>
      <P>However, the number of Chinese tourists has not increased as significantly as
expected.</P>
      <P>Even in October when Chinese citizens  enjoyed a weeklong holiday, the number of
Chinese tourist arrivals only totaled 11,797, far below the projected target.</P>
      <P>According   to  tallies  compiled   by  the  National Immigration Agency, about
68,000 Chinese citizens visited Taiwan in the first 10 months of this year. If
the daily number of Chinese tourist arrivals was estimated at 400 in November,
the total number for the first 11 months will be about 80,000, falling far short
of the target, immigration officials said.</P>
      <P>Amid the lingering  global financial  turmoil and economic recession, the
officials said, the number of Chinese arrivals is not expected to increase
substantially in December.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A suspect, who tried to kill herself Saturday after being interrogated over her
possible role in alleged graft cases involving the ex-first family, could ask
for protection if necessary, a top prosecutor said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Yun-nan, chief of the Special Investigation Division under the Supreme
Prosecutors Office, said the division has told the family of Tu Li-ping that if
necessary, the division could provide her with abodyguard.</P>
      <P>Tu, a board member of Yuanta Securities, attempted to commit suicide by taking
sleeping pills and inhaling car exhaust fumes one day after she was released by
the Taipei District Court on bail of NT$1 million (US$303,303).</P>
      <P>Before she attempted self-asphyxiation, Tu reportedly made a cellphone call to
her elder sister to confide what she was about to do. The sister then called an
ambulance which rushed Tu to a hospital near her home in Taipei County for
treatment.</P>
      <P>Upon learning of Tu's suicide attempt, Minister of Justice Wang Ching-feng urged
her Monday to cherish her own health so that she can be strong to fight for
justice and clear her name in the days to come.</P>
      <P>Wang also said that if necessary, Tu could file for protection with the Special
Investigation Division.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the division extended special protection to former president
Chen Shui-bian's cashier Chen Chen-hui after she was freed without conditions
Nov. 20. Chen Chen-hui was detained Sept. 25 because of her suspected role in
helping to transfer a presidential fund and bribes to overseas bank accounts of
the former first family.</P>
      <P>Wang also censured Tu's lawyer Tan Hu for disclosing to the media the details of
Tu's interrogation after she was released on bail.</P>
      <P>The minister said Tan had violated the Act of Lawyers and reneged on the code of
ethics and norms observed by lawyers.</P>
      <P>Tan told the media last week that Tu, accompanied her Yuanta Securities  bosses,
visited former President  Chen Shui-bian's residence sometime in 2005 and handed
NT$200 million (US$6.06 million) to Chen's wife Wu Shu-jen in the hope that the
then first family would not intervene in a buyout project in which Yuanta was
involved.</P>
      <P>"Tu and her boss were just trying to persuade the then first family not to
intervene and to allow the market to work. Tu was not offering a bribe," the
lawyer said.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung MRT's operating hours will be extended on Dec. 31 for the

services will run until 2 a.m., instead of the usual 11:30 p.m.</P>
      <P>Huang said that although there is no MRT station adjacent to the square outside
the Dream Mall where one of the main New Year's Eve activities will be held,
shuttle bus services will be offered from the site to nearby stations to

      <P>The municipal government  has estimated  that some 300,000 Kaohsiung residents
will take part in the various New Year's Eve activities to be held around the

      <P>The country's chief economic planner put his job on the line Monday by promising
to step down if a shopping voucher program crafted by his office boosts economic
growth by less than half of his estimate.</P>
      <P>Chen Tain-jy, chief of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, told
the Legislative Yuan that he stands by the estimate made by his council that the
shopping vouchers program will boost the gross domestic product (GDP) by 0.64
percent next year.</P>
      <P>Chen said that although no economic policy can be executed as comprehensively as
expected, he would resign from his post if the program failed to boost the
economy by less than half of his council's forecast.</P>
      <P>He made the promise while fielding questions from lawmakers who claimed that a
similar program in Japan in 1999 boosted that county's GDP by only 0.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Chen said the difference lies in the fact that Japan's national income is much
higher than Taiwan's.</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan's program, the Executive Yuan will give shopping vouchers worth
NT$3600 to each citizen before the Chinese New Year, which falls on Jan. 26, to
prompt consumption in hopes that it will in turn fuel economic growth.</P>
      <P>The country's economy dipped to negative growth in the third quarter of this
year and is expected to remain in negative for the next two quarters.</P>
      <P>As a result, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics on
Nov. 21 adjusted its forecast for economic growth downward from 5.08 percent to
2.12 percent for this year and from 4.3 percent to 1.86 percent for next year.</P>

      <P>There has been no obvious tide of lay-offs among companies in the Hsinchu
Science Park in the face of slumping export trade as a result of the global
economic downturn, Tu Chi-hsiang, a deputy chief of the science park, said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Responding to a recent series of news reports on salary cuts and redundancies by
companies in the country's science-based industrial parks, Tu said that so far,
he has not seen an obvious lay-off trend at the Hsinchu facility, known as
"Taiwan's Silicon Valley."</P>
      <P>Tu also noted that the number of disputes in the park has not increased this
year, adding that the science park authorities received 45 complaints about
possible disputes between management and workers in the first 11 months of this
year, compared to 47 in 2007.</P>
      <P>According to recent business and industrial news reports, major high-technology
manufacturers  have witnessed  slides in their production line utilization rates
over the past several months. Among them,  United Microelectronics Corp. and
Vanguard International Semiconductor Corp. have seen utilization rates fall to a

      <P>The National Communications Commission (NCC) decided Monday to lower the basic
cable TV rates of eight cable service providers in six counties around Taiwan
from the start of next year.</P>
      <P>The monthly rates of the cable providers in the counties of Yunlin, Chiayi,
Tainan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu will be lowered by between NT$20 (US$0.60) and
NT$50 from Jan. 1, according to the NCC decision.</P>
      <P>The six counties are the only ones in Taiwan that have not set up committees to
regulate cable TV rates, so they are subject to review by the NCC.</P>
      <P>The rate cuts of between NT$20-50 will translate into savings of NT$240 to
NT$600 per year for customers.</P>
      <P>The Taipei municipal government decided on Nov. 28 to maintain basic cable TV
rates in the city at NT$530 per month, while reducing rates for low income

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou welcomed Strobe Talbott, president of the Brookings
Institution and Richard Bush, former chairman of the American Institute in
Taiwan,  at the Presidential Office Monday and described their visit to Taiwan
as significant.</P>
      <P>Talbott and Bush are visiting Taiwan to attend a seminar titled Cross- Strait
Political and Economic Relations and the Next American Administration, arranged
by the Epoch Foundation, a local research institution that seeks to integrate
the resources of the private sector with the world's best academic institutions
and resources. It focuses its research on Taiwanese industrial and economic
issues, regional economic cooperation and the region's economic outlook.</P>
      <P>"Given that the 2008 presidential election in the U.S. has just been completed
and that the new administration will take office in January next year, your
visit to Taiwan at this time has a very important meaning for us," Ma said.</P>
      <P>He also commented that Talbott is very experienced in media, foreign diplomacy
and government work.</P>
      <P>"Your work has made the Brookings Institute one of the leading and very
important public policy research institutes in the United States, " Ma added.</P>
      <P>In addition, he also praised Richard Bush's familiarity with Taiwan issues,
Chinese affairs and cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>"Your book, Untying the Knot, has won wide confirmation, " said Ma. "The
developments between Taiwan and mainland China for the past three years have
coincided with your predictions," he went on.</P>
      <P>Richard Bush is director of the Brookings Center for Northeast Asian Policy
Studies (CNAPS) . His two-decade public service career spans Congress, the
intelligence community and the U.S. State Department, and includes a stint as
chairman and managing director of the American Institute in Taiwan from 1997 to
2002.</P>
      <P>CNAPS conducts research, analysis and outreach to enhance policy development and
understanding on the political, economic and security issues facing Northeast
Asia.</P>
      <P>Talbott, an expert in U.S. foreign relations, is a journalist associated with
Time magazine and a diplomat who served as deputy secretary  of state  from
1994  to 2001 during  the Clinton administration.</P>
      <P>He has also been involved with the America Abroad Media Advisory Board,  the
American Academy of Diplomacy,  the Bretton Woods Committee, the Council on
Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission.</P>

      <P>Vice Premier Chiu Cheng-hsiung said Monday that there is a need for the two
sides of Taiwan Strait to sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU)  on financial
supervision to facilitate financial services exchanges and cooperation.</P>
      <P>Chiu made the remarks in an address at the opening of the 2008 Conference on
Cross-Strait Banking and Finance, a two-day event held at the Taiwan Academy of
Banking and Finance.</P>
      <P>The two sides already maintain close cooperative relations in economy and trade,
and therefore each also has the need for frequent exchanges in the financial
sector. However, Chiu went on, the two sides have yet to sign a financial
supervision MOU, so that there are still many restrictions on financial business
exchanges between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Citing government statistics, Chiu pointed out that bilateral trade reached
US$56.7 billion in the first six months of the year, and that as of the end of
June, Taiwanese businesses had invested some US$70 billion in China, reflecting
the frequent capital inflow and outflow between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The vice premier noted that the two sides of the strait have opened their
financial markets to the world under World Trade Organization regulations. He
said it is unavoidable that the two sides will develop closer financial ties, as
the number of Taiwan's listed companies with investments in China has reached
more than 900, accounting for over 70 percent of all listed companies in Taiwan,
while there are currently seven Taiwanese financial institutions and 13 stock
traders with representative offices in China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chinese student recruitment not aimed at boosting enrollment: MOE</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Ministry of Education (MOE) official said Monday that a government plan to
open Taiwan's doors to students from China is not aimed at addressing the
sliding enrollment rates facing most of the country's privately run colleges and
universities.</P>
      <P>Ho Chuo-fei, deputy director of the MOE Department of Higher Education, said the
ministry has mapped out several plans on the opening measures in response to
President Ma Ying-jeou's Oct. 5 announcement of the plan.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks at an MOE-sponsored forum held at National Taiwan University
on the possible impact on local society and its education system in the event
that Chinese students are allowed to pursue advanced studies and sit tests in
Taiwan to obtain Taiwanese professional licenses.</P>
      <P>A number of representatives of public and privately run colleges and
universities were invited to attend the forum, where they spelled out a variety
of opinions on the issue.</P>
      <P>Some of the representatives  suggested that privately  run institutes should be
allowed first to recruit Chinese students in an effort to bolster sagging
enrollment numbers, while others suggested that Taiwan first open its doors to
postgraduate students from China.</P>
      <P>Sun Shu-ping, provost of I-Shou University in the southern county of Kaohsiung,
made a keynote speech at the forum on the institute's own experiences in hosting
students from China.</P>
      <P>I-Shou is a unique case, as it has since January 2007 accepted students from 12
Chinese universities, including the prestigious Shangdong and Xiamen
universities, for short term training and academic exchange programs.</P>
      <P>Sun said that after hosting some 300 of the students, the university has found
that management of their daily lives, their behavior and their mental condition
can prove problematic.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, Taiwan will open its doors to Chinese students seeking to
pursue advanced studies but will not allow them to sit tests in Taiwan to obtain
Taiwanese professional licenses. He added that the policy is aimed at
liberalizing and globalizing Taiwan's educational environment.</P>
      <P>The president said that while the policy means that colleges and universities
will be allowed to recruit Chinese students, the administration will not push or
encourage them to do so.</P>
      <P>Noting that China now has over 2,500 colleges and universities, some of which
rank among the leading educational institutes in the world, Ma said Taiwan will
leave itself a laughing stock if it continues to close its doors and turn its
back on world opinion.</P>

      <P>Five visually impaired runners will take part in a 1,100-km relay around Taiwan,
hoping to raise public awareness of the welfare of the disabled and to encourage
the physically challenged not to lose hope, the race organizers announced
Monday.</P>
      <P>Named "See Hope at the Intersection, " the round-island relay will be a
challenge for the five runners, said Wu Hsing-chuan at a press conference. Wu is
the coach and running companion of Chang Wen-yan, one of the runners, who has
been dubbed "Taiwan's Forrest Gump" after the hero of the eponymously titled
Hollywood movie who ran his way into audiences' hearts.</P>
      <P>Each of the runners will be tethered by the wrist to a sighted running companion
who will act as guide, keeping the runners on track.</P>
      <P>Wu added that the five blind runners -- all of whom make their livings as
masseurs -- lost their sight due to accidents or genetic diseases, at which
point they found themselves at an intersection in their lives, unsure of which
direction to follow.</P>
      <P>"It is difficult to run when you cannot see, but let there be no destination, "
Wu went on, encouraging the runners to remember the spirit of the marathon,
which is perseverance.</P>
      <P>Himself an experienced runner, Chang has competed in many races with Wu in the
United States and Japan, and together they have even climbed Taiwan's highest
peak, the 3,952-meter Mount Jade.</P>
      <P>The runners will start the ambitious relay from the top of the Taipei 101
building -- Taiwan's highest building -- on Dec 13. Maintaining a pace of about
100 km per day, they are expected to arrive back in Taipei at a downtown
shopping mall Dec 25.</P>
      <P>Each of them will need to run for around 20 km per day, every day, Wu noted.</P>
      <P>A documentary team will also accompany the runners to record their 13-day
journey, which is being organized by the Taiwan Ahgan Spiritual Development
Association and the Soroptimist International of the Taiwan Region, with
assistance from the Ministry of the Interior, the Sports Affairs Council and
various non-government organizations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tax deductions from 2008 individual income to be increased</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet has reached consensus with lawmakers screening amendments to the
Income Tax Act that the four increased individual income tax deductions allowed
by the amendments will be applicable in May 2009 when taxpayers file their 2008
returns, Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der disclosed Monday.</P>
      <P>Lee made the disclosure to reporters after giving a report before the Finance
Committee of the legislature on the proposed amendments to Clause One of Article
Five, Article 17 and Article 126.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the Ministry of Finance plans to increase the standard tax
deduction from individual income from the current NT$46,000 to NT$60,000 for an
unmarried taxpayer and from NT$92,000 to NT$120,000 for a married couple.</P>
      <P>A salary or wage earner's special deduction will be increased from NT$78,000 per
salary or wage earner to NT$NT$100,000, while the deduction for the disabled
will also be raised from the current NT$77,000 per disabled person to
NT$100,000.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendments will also grant a deduction of NT$25,000 per student in
each household for higher education expenses, instead of the current NT$25,000
for each tax return.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance has estimated that the four increased deductions would
affect 3.6 million families in Taiwan, accounting for 69 percent of the 5.18
million households that file tax returns each year.</P>
      <P>According to law, the amendments adopted in 2008 should be implemented only in
2010, making them good for the 2009 income tax returns. But legislators of the
ruling Kuomintang said this will not be a problem, because they will introduce
another amendment to allow the newly increased deductions to be applied to the
2008 tax year.</P>
      <P>Individual income tax is levied on Taiwan-source income of both resident and
non-resident individuals per calendar year.</P>
      <P>Individuals are considered residents in Taiwan for tax purposes if they are
Republic of China citizens or if they are foreign nationals who reside in Taiwan
for at least 183 days within a calendar year.</P>
      <P>They are subject to income tax on all their incomes which originate in Taiwan
and must file income tax returns and pay taxes between May 1 and 31 of the
following year.</P>
      <P>The incomes of the taxpayer, taxpayer's spouse, and dependents must be
consolidated and reported on one income tax return. Resident taxpayers are
allowed to claim personal exemptions and deductions on their tax returns.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has donated 600 blankets and 600 boxes of dried food to Panama to assist
Panamanians who have suffered  from last month's floods,  the Republic  of
China's ambassador, Simon Ko, said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Ko said he has presented the donations to the office of Panama's first lady,
which will help distribute the supplies.</P>
      <P>The donation includes contributions from the Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce, the
association of Taiwanese expatriates in Panama, and Taiwan-based Mega
International Commercial Bank, Ko said.</P>
      <P>The donation is just the first wave of Taiwan's relief aid to Panama.  Taiwan's
technical  aid group in Panama will donate self-produced dried fruits and
processed foods next week and will continue making donations based on the
condition of flood affected areas, Ko said.</P>
      <P>According to the latest reports by Panama's national civil protection service,
the most seriously affected areas are the Caribbean coastal province of Bocas
del Toro in western Panama and Pacific coastal province of Darien in eastern
Panama. Indigenous people who lived in poorly built housing in those areas are
the worst affected.</P>
      <P>Flood waters have left eight dead and six missing. About 11,670 people in the
province of Bocas del Toro have had to stay in temporary shelters due to the
flooding.</P>
      <P>Infrastructure in Panama Province, which contains the country's capital city,
was also damaged by heavy and incessant rains that began Nov. 20. Two major
outbound highways in Panama City were blocked due to mudslides, and the Panama
government is making urgent repairs to the damaged roads, the reports said.</P>
      <P>According  to Rodrigo Cigarruista,  Panama's  vice interior minister, the
country's relief forces have distributed food, water, medicine and blankets to
people in affected areas by plane.</P>
      <P>A total of 21 aircraft have been dispatched to carry out relief service,
including six helicopters from the United States and two airplanes from
Columbia, Cigarruista said.</P>

      <P>The Philippines government has been setting up special economic zones and
providing incentives such as tax exemptions in a bid to attract more foreign
investors, officials at an investment opportunities seminar told participants in
Taipei Monday.</P>
      <P>The Philippine Investment Opportunities Seminar was held by the Manila Economic
and Cultural Office (MECO) in Taiwan and the Philippine Department of Trade and
Industry (DTI) in Taipei Monday with the aim of attracting Taiwanese investors
to the Philippines.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the seminar, Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA)  Director-
General Lilia B.  de Lima,  who is also the undersecretary of his country's
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) , gave a detailed description of the
Philippines investment environment.</P>
      <P>"Over the past years, we have attracted many large investments to the
Philippines, " said Lima."Large manufacturers in the world, such as electronics,
household appliance, computer hardware and garment makers, have set up factories
in our country."</P>
      <P>Noting that in 2007, the Philippines posted economic growth of 7.3 percent, the
highest in three decades, Lima urged Taiwan investors to take advantage of the
incentives being offered by countries in the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) free trade group.</P>
      <P>"The original member countries of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), which
includes the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei,
will lower their tariffs to near zero, thus removing trade barriers within AFTA
in the year 2010," Lima said.</P>
      <P>AFTA's four new member countries, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar, will do
the same in 2015, he added.</P>
      <P>"Therefore if Taiwan businesses do not have factories set up within these
countries, then tariff-wise, it will be a great disadvantage to Taiwan
entrepreneurs," said Lima. "I recommend the Philippines as a great place for
Taiwan businessmen to set up factories so that tariffs may be avoided."</P>
      <P>According to MECO, other incentives offered by the Philippines government for
foreigners who want to invest in the country include a special investor's
Residence Visa that can be extended to immediate members of the family and
income tax holidays (ITH) of 6 years for pioneer firms and 4 years for non-
pioneer firms. After the ITH period expires, there will be an option to pay a
special 5 percent tax on gross income, in lieu of national and local taxes, it
added.</P>
      <P>During the investment seminar, undersecretary of the Philippines Department of
Tourism Phineas Alburo said that the country's tourism industry has experienced
rapid growth in recent years.</P>
      <P>"In the past five years, the number of tourists visiting the Philippines has
grown by 12.9 percent," said Alburo. "In the year 2007 alone, the number of
tourists coming to our country topped 3 million."</P>
      <P>Alburo said that the tourism industry is the biggest source of income for the
Philippines.</P>
      <P>"Right now, the Philippines' tourism industry is still growing at an astonishing
pace," said Alburo."Therefore, the hotels and resorts in Philippines require
large amounts of capital investment so that they could expand and satisfy the
growing demand."</P>
      <P>According to Alburo, business opportunities in the Philippine hospitality
industry is on the upswing, as hotel and resort occupancy rates in major tourist
destinations reached 75-80 percent on a year round basis.</P>
      <P>As a result, investments in the tourism industry have been flowing into the
country, he added.</P>
      <P>According to statistics provided by MECO,  the Philippines Department of Tourism
in 2006 approved investments totalling a record high 93.8 billion Philippine
pesos (about US$2.08 billion) , and in the first quarter of 2007 approved
investments of 9.52 billion Philippine pesos (or about US$ 210 million).</P>
      <P>Major international groups such as Banyan Tree, Marriott Hotel and Raffles Hotel
are starting to invest in the Philippines, MECO added.</P>
      <P>Also, a consortium made up of the Trump Organization -- headed by American
business Mogul Donald Trump -- American Westgate Resorts Asia Ltd. and the
Korean Heung-A Property Group will be investing in a US$1 billion tourism
project in Subic Bay in the Philippines, MECO stated.</P>
      <P>Alburo said that the Philippines government continues to focus on the
requirements of the tourism industry by putting in place major infrastructure
projects such as international and domestic airports, seaports and roadways to
connect the 7,107 islands of the Philippines.</P>
      <P>In the absence of formal diplomatic ties, MECO is the de-facto embassy of the
Republic of Philippines in Taiwan, handling trade and cultural exchanges between
the two countries.</P>

      <P>Forty-five percent of fresh graduates in Taiwan who responded to a recent survey
said they had not found full-time employment, despite many of them having
started seeking jobs some considerable time before graduating.</P>
      <P>Although 52 percent of the respondents said they started looking for jobs before
graduating in June, 45 percent said they had not succeeded in finding a full-
time job as of November, according to the results of the survey released Monday.</P>
      <P>The survey was carried out Nov. 14-28 by the online employment service provider
1111 Job Bank among people who graduated from senior high schools or tertiary
education institutes this summer.</P>
      <P>The figure for unsuccessful job-hunters was nearly double that of the year-
earlier level, when 23.12 percent of fresh graduates said in similar survey
conducted in December 2007 that they were still looking for full-time work.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that 63 percent of the new graduates who responded remained
jobless as of November. Of the total, 18 percent said they had found employment
but had quit for a variety of reasons.</P>
      <P>Of the respondents still looking for jobs, nearly 66 percent said they had never
worked in a part-time job, representing an increase of 20.5 percent year-on-
year.</P>
      <P>This figure shows that fewer jobless people have been taking part-time jobs this
year than last year, according to the 1111 pollsters.</P>
      <P>Of the new graduates now working full time, 42.89 percent said they are planning
to change jobs after Chinese New Year, which falls on Jan. 26, 2009. Last
December, the figure stood at 57.73 percent.</P>
      <P>Nearly 52 percent of the fresh graduates who are now working said they had not
changed jobs, the survey found.</P>
      <P>On average, the new graduates who have been in full-time work since graduating
but who have since left their jobs had changed jobs 1.67 times over the past
five months, compared to two times last year, according to the survey results.</P>
      <P>Of the reasons for quitting, 31.44 percent mentioned failure of the job to meet
their expectations, 17.85 percent mentioned long working hours and 16.15 percent
mentioned excessive work pressure.</P>
      <P>Another 15.58 percent mentioned a desire to find another job with higher pay and
better benefits, while 14.45 percent said they left their job as a result of
being laid off.</P>
      <P>The survey results also show that the starting monthly salaries of successful
job-seekers averaged NT$25,726 (US$780) this year, compared to the NT$27,974
listed as the average expected salary.</P>
      <P>The survey obtained 1,346 valid responses with a margin of error of 2.67
percentage points.</P>

      <P>Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) Chairman Chen Tain-jy said
Monday he is optimistic that there will be smooth delivery and widespread use of
the NT$3,600 (US$180) shopping vouchers that will be issued to each Taiwanese
resident on Jan. 18.</P>
      <P>Chen said he is confident that as high as 95 percent of the vouchers to be
issued would be delivered to the public if no problems occur in the process and
about 90 percent would be spent.</P>
      <P>The CEPD head made the remarks while answering questions from lawmakers at a
joint intepellation session of the economics, interior and finance committees at
the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker Kung Wen-chi urged the Cabinet to take action
to ensure the distribution of the vouchers to residents in the mountainous areas
and on outlying islands and to further educate the public about their use.</P>
      <P>Kung also suggested  the government  extend its originally scheduled deadline
for the use of the shopping vouchers from Sept. 30 to Oct. 31. next year to give
the public more time to spend them.</P>
      <P>According to Vice Minister of the Interior Chien Tai-lang's report to the
legislature, the shopping vouchers could be given to the public through more
than 14,000 distribution spots scattered across the country by Jan. 18, as long
as the bill clears the Legislative Yuan in time.</P>
      <P>The vouchers will be distributed to some 23.01 million Taiwanese citizens with
registered households in Taiwan, as well as some 14,000 Taiwan nationals who do
not have household registration but who have obtained  residence  permission
and more than 75,000  Chinese mainlanders who have obtained permanent residence
here.</P>
      <P>In addition, around 67,000 foreign spouses and 741 spouses from Hong Kong and
Macau married to Taiwanese nationals who own permanent residence will also be
included in the program once the measure takes effect, Chien said.</P>
      <P>As a means of propping up the economy, the Cabinet announced in November that
the government will distribute an estimated NT$83.5 billion (US$2.52 billion) in
consumption vouchers to the public before Chinese New Year, which falls on Jan.
26.</P>
      <P>All residents in Taiwan, regardless of income level or age, will each receive
NT$3,600 in coupons, which can be used to purchase goods at local stores and
traditional markets.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet has proposed a special bill to provide a legal basis for the voucher
policy. According to Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, the special statute
has to be approved by the legislature by Dec. 26 at the latest, if the Jan. 18
deadline for issuing the consumption vouchers is to be met.</P>
      <P>The distribution of the vouchers is slated to end on April 30.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chinese character festival kicks off in Taipei</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Chinese character festival kicked off in Taipei Monday, with a wide variety of
activities designed to emphasize the cultural and educational value of
traditional Chinese characters, as well as to promote their use as inspiration
for the creative industry, according to the organizers.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Department of Cultural Affairs Commissioner Lee Yong- ping told a
press conference  that unlike various forums and exhibitions on the topic that
have been held regularly over the past few years, this year's event also
features programs that demonstrate how Chinese characters can be applied to
various aspects of life.</P>
      <P>As modern traditional  Chinese  writing  has evolved  from pictographic
characters, she said, their forms "contain a strong artistic sense, " which can
serve as inspiration for creative design.</P>
      <P>Lee said that with the global trend of learning the Chinese language gaining
momentum, Taiwan should not regard traditional characters only as "functional
meaning carriers, " but also as a modern artistic medium.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, the festival -- which is taking place in various different
venues throughout the city until Jan. 11 next year -- includes a creative
market, which she said will surprise visitors when they see "the diversity of
items evolved from Chinese characters that can be created."</P>
      <P>In addition, Lee invited the public to take part in a calligraphy writing
activity at the Huashan Creative and Cultural Park -- site of part of the
festival -- which she hopes will attract at least 10,000 participants in an
attempt to break the world record for the largest number of calligraphers
working at the same time.</P>
      <P>Lee said the festival also features civic forums on Chinese language, in
particular a discussion on the blend of Oriental elements in Taiwan's popular
music scene, a trend that has piqued the interest of Taiwan's lyricists  and
composers  in appreciating traditional  literature,  to which some of them now
turn for inspiration.</P>
      <P>Temple  tours,  as well  as traditional  opera  and music performances, are
other highlights of the festival, while Huang Chuan-chin, one of the organizers,
said this year's program also includes a fashion design show with a concept
based on the shapes of Chinese characters or the strokes of Chinese calligraphy,
along with the use of traditional design techniques such as printing, dying and
embroidery.</P>
      <P>He added that the festival also has a section in which foreigners can learn the
rudiments of the traditional artform of Chinese brush calligraphy.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan one of the few remaining countries that still use traditional
Chinese characters rather than the simplified form developed in China, Yang Du,
secretary-general of the National Cultural Association, said the country should
take advantage of its heritage by developing a branch of the cultural and
creative industry centered on Taiwan's writing system.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) on Monday
commended several donors of secondhand computers that were used to benefit
children in remote areas of Taiwan, and it urged more people to join the
resource recycling campaign.</P>
      <P>EPA Minister Shen Shu-hung said a total of 19,414 used computers and 15,929
computer monitors, donated mainly by government agencies, universities and
private enterprises, have been recycled this year.</P>
      <P>The recycled items were reconfigured into 7,210 computers by engineers of the
Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research and then given to children in
elementary schools and junior high schools in remote regions around the country.</P>
      <P>In all, 4,756 children and 149 social welfare organizations have benefited from
the program.</P>
      <P>According to the EPA, it was difficult to help install the more than 7,000
computers in remote areas, as engineers and volunteers had to contact potential
recipients one-by-one, and access to the areas was often blocked because of the
many typhoons that occurred this year.</P>
      <P>Hua-yuan Elementary School in Hsinchu County in northern Taiwan and a
nongovernmental  organization  advocating  the rights of indigenous people were
among those groups receiving the most used computers under the program.</P>
      <P>The school and the advocacy group expressed their gratitude for the rebuilt
computers at the ceremony, saying that the policy not only benefited the
environment but also underprivileged children, who will now have equal access to
information from around the world.</P>
      <P>Shen said Taiwan's recycling rate has reached about 40 percent this year,
ranking high compared to developed countries, and hoped local residents would
continue to support environmental efforts.</P>
      <P>"Resource recycling is an indispensable way to sustain the Earth for a long
time, " he said, while urging more people to recycle resources that are still
usable.</P>

      <P>The government will invest NT$12.6 billion (US$376 million) in a project to
prevent natural disasters in the country's mountainous regions, the highest
amount ever allocated for the goal, Taiwan's economic planning body said in a
statement Monday.</P>
      <P>The four-year project, which will run from 2009 to 2012 and extend an existing
program,  covers mudslide  monitoring  and forecasting, reservoir conservation,
mountain disaster prevention, and mountain slope management.</P>
      <P>Designed and proposed by the Council of Agriculture, the project was approved by
the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) Monday.</P>
      <P>The CEPD's statement pointed out that Taiwan is prone to natural disasters and
suffers from a major disaster every three to five years on average, with serious
damage caused each time.</P>
      <P>Citing the World Bank's Natural Disaster Hotspots report released in 2005, the
statement said 73 percent of Taiwan's people face the threat of at least three
of the major natural hazards identified in the report, namely typhoons, floods,
and earthquakes.</P>
      <P>About 90 percent of the country's residents are threatened by at least two major
natural hazards, the statement said, also citing the report.</P>
      <P>The statement pointed out that the project, along with the government's flood
prevention plan, will contribute to lowering disaster risks and strengthening
Taiwan's soil and water resource conservation.</P>
      <P>The budget for the disaster prevention project will be allocated over four
years, with NT$2.1 billion to be spent in 2009, NT$3.36 billion in 2010, NT$3.49
billion in 2011, and NT$3.63 billion in 2012, the statement said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Airing of Taiwan-produced film in China might be delayed: GIO</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>There might be a delay in the scheduled screening of a locally produced box
office hit in China, but it does not necessarily mean the plan has been dropped,
the Government Information Office (GIO) said Monday.</P>
      <P>The United Daily News, a local daily, reported Monday that China has suspended a
plan to show "Cape No.7" prior to Chinese New Year, which falls on January 26,
citing Beijing-based newspaper Legal Mirror.</P>
      <P>Although the exact reason for the postponement was unclear, it is known that
China's top negotiator with Taiwan, Chen Yunlin, said in a seminar last week
that the film touches on Japan's colonization of Taiwan from 1895 to 1945.</P>
      <P>The reports suggested that the top brass in Beijing worried that the airing of
the film might whip up nationalistic sentiment in China.</P>
      <P>Frank Chen, director of the GIO's Department of Motion Picture Affairs, said
that Wang Ying-shyang, chairman of Taiwan's Long Shong Film Co., the distributor
of the film, visited the GIO Monday to explain the distribution and screening of
the film in China.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, Long Shong received an e-mail from China Nov. 19 saying that
there were still technical problems to be coordinated, and that Long Shong
should hold off on sending the film to China pending further notification.</P>
      <P>Judging from Wang's explanation, the screening of the film in China should be
seen as being "delayed," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said that Cape No. 7, a romantic comedy set in Hengchun, Pingtung that has
parallel plots set in the present day and 60 years ago at the end of the
colonial period, is a film about relationships between people that will "touch
the hearts of all Chinese."</P>
      <P>"If Chinese people can also watch the film, it will help cultural exchanges
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait," he insisted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) blasted China for
viewing the film from a political perspective.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Pan Meng-an noted that after watching the movie during his visit to
Taiwan Nov. 3-7 in his capacity as the president of the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, Chen Yunlin said "Taiwan's sea is
beautiful, Hengchun is beautiful, and the Malasan millet wine tastes good," and
he expressed his hope to see Hengchun one day.</P>
      <P>But his attitude changed after returning to China, and he has now attempted to
ban the film from showing in China, Pan said, which the lawmaker suggested was a
decision made purely "from the perspective of a political angle."</P>
      <P>As of the end of November, the film had taken in NT$459.15 million (US$13.91
million), becoming the second top grossing film in the island's cinematic
history, behind Titanic.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Market mechanisms to decide charter flight fares: CAA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 1 (CNA)
12/01/08  22:39:51
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Responding to a consumer group's appeal that fares for daily nonstop charter
flights between Taiwan and China be reduced, the Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA) said Monday that ticket prices should be decided by market
mechanisms.</P>
      <P>The Consumers' Foundation suggested earlier Monday that fares for the cross-
Taiwan Strait charters, to be operated on a daily basis beginning Dec. 15,
should be slashed by about 42 percent to reflect plummeting oil prices and
straighter routes that will not require carriers to pass through Hong Kong or
Macau air space.</P>
      <P>Under a 42 percent fare cut, the price of a one-way economy class ticket between
Taipei and Shanghai on the weekend could be reduced by between NT$8,100 and
NT$10,500 (US$326), according to the foundation.</P>
      <P>If the cross-strait charter flight prices cannot be effectively cut, foreign
carriers should be allowed to compete in the market, which at present is only
open to Taiwan- and China-based carriers, the foundation said.</P>
      <P>The group also raised concerns that the fares for the new nonstop direct cross-
strait charters operating from Tuesday to Thursday would be even higher than the
current fares for flights that transit through Hong Kong or Macau.</P>
      <P>The CAA did not dispute the foundation's assertion, saying greater market demand
and fewer flights would certainly push up prices, and that it would respect
market mechanisms.</P>
      <P>The CAA said, for example, that fares for current weekend nonstop cross-strait
charter flights (implemented since July on Friday through Monday) are already
higher than those for flights transiting through a third country or area.</P>
      <P>Prices for charter flights, regardless of international or cross-strait routes,
are usually jointly determined by tour agencies and aviation companies without
being reviewed in advance by the CAA, CAA officials said.</P>

      <P>Motorbike owners around Taiwan have until Dec. 15 to hand over two-stroke
motorcycles that are at least seven years old in exchange for a cash subsidy of
NT$1,500, environmental officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) has set aside
NT$525 million (US$15.75 million) since January 2007 for the program, hoping to
phase out 350,000 aged two-stroke motorcycles that are blamed for much of the
air pollution in Taiwan's cities.</P>
      <P>According to the EPA officials, two-stroke motorcycles generate up to five times
more air pollution than the four-stroke motorcycles of a similar age.</P>
      <P>The three-year program is also part of the Cabinet's efforts to echo calls by
the international community to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      <P>Cities and counties around Taiwan have been given different quotas each year on
how many old but still running two-stroke motorcycles they can accept in return
for subsidies.</P>
      <P>For example, in 2008, Taipei County has a quota of 6,000, while the quotas for
other districts are 5,000 for Taipei City, 5,500 for Tainan County, 2,000 for
Miaoli County, 200 for the island county of Penghu, and 100 for the island
county of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>The program first began in Kaohsiung City, Kaohsiung County and Pingtung County
in southern Taiwan in 2007 and was expanded in 2008 to cover all other cities
and counties in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>By the end of November this year, more than 30,000 motorcycle owners in the port
city of Kaohsiung and the counties of Kaohsiung and Pingtung had cashed in on
the program by turning in their old two-stroke bikes to licensed factories for
recycling.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Lawmakers want standard income tax deduction raised to NT$73,000</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan's Finance Committee on Monday approved amendments to the
Income Tax Act submitted by the Cabinet after further raising the standard
individual income tax deduction from the NT$60,000 proposed by the ministry to
NT$73,000.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendments are to Clause One of Article Five, Article 17 and
Article 126 of the Income Tax Act.</P>
      <P>The amendments originally proposed increasing  the standard deduction for
individual tax filers from the current NT$46,000 to NT$60,000 and from NT$92,000
to NT$120,000 for a married couple.</P>
      <P>But the Finance Committee raised it further to NT$73,000 for an unmarried
taxpayer and to NT$146,000 for a married couple.</P>
      <P>The increases on three other deductions proposed by the Cabinet remained
unchanged.</P>
      <P>A salary or wage earner's special deduction would be increased from NT$78,000
per salary or wage earner to NT$NT$100,000, while the deduction for the disabled
would also be raised from the current NT$77,000 per disabled person to
NT$100,000.</P>
      <P>The amendments would also grant a deduction of NT$25,000 per student in each
household to help cover higher education expenses, instead of the current
NT$25,000 for each tax return.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der, who gave a report on the
proposed legislation, told reporters that the Cabinet had reached a consensus
with lawmakers that the four increased individual income tax deductions allowed
by the amendments would be applicable in May 2009 when taxpayers file their 2008
returns.</P>
      <P>Lee said the Ministry of Finance has estimated that the four increased
deductions would affect 3.6 million families in Taiwan, accounting for 69
percent of the 5.18 million households that file tax returns each year.</P>
      <P>According to law, the amendments adopted in 2008 should be implemented only in
2010, making them good for the 2009 income tax returns. But legislators of the
ruling Kuomintang said this will not be a problem, because they will introduce
another amendment to allow the newly increased deductions to be applied to the
2008 tax year.</P>
      <P>Individual income tax is levied on Taiwan-source income of both resident and
non-resident individuals per calendar year.</P>
      <P>Individuals are considered residents in Taiwan for tax purposes if they are
Republic of China citizens or if they are foreign nationals who reside in Taiwan
for at least 183 days within a calendar year.</P>
      <P>They are subject to income tax on all their income that originates in Taiwan and
must file income tax returns and pay taxes between May 1 and 31 of the following
year.</P>
      <P>The incomes of the taxpayer, taxpayer's spouse, and dependents must be
consolidated and reported on one income tax return. Resident taxpayers are
allowed to claim personal exemptions and deductions on their tax returns.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's state-run petroleum refiner, CPC Corp., Taiwan announced Monday that it
will slash the domestic price of low sulfur fuel oil by 37.68 percent, the
largest price reduction in history.</P>
      <P>The price for low sulfur fuel oil will be lowered by NT$5,802 (US$173.5) per
kiloliter to NT$9,595, while the price of low sulfur boiler fuel oil will be cut
by NT$5,625 per kiloliter to NT$11,092, according to a CPC statement.</P>
      <P>The adjustment will take effect from midnight Monday.</P>
      <P>CPC officials  attributed  the price  cut to the plunging international price of
crude oil, which has dropped to around US$50 per barrel.</P>
      <P>Following Monday's price cuts, domestic fuel oil prices will have fallen back to
their level of April 2007, and many will be watching to see if the price
reductions will relieve cost pressures on local businesses and trigger drops in
the prices of daily commodities.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, CPC also announced it will cut the wholesale price for liquefied
petroleum gas (LPG) in December by NT$5.75 per kilogram to NT$16.64.</P>
      <P>Under the adjustment, also to take effect at midnight Monday, the price for a 20
kg cylinder of household LPG will be lowered to NT$115, according to CPC.</P>
      <P>Liquefied natural gas (LNG) , however, was not included in the latest round of
price decreases. The company explained it was because the company has not yet
received reference price reports indicating an obvious drop in prices.</P>
      <P>CPC officials speculated that the long-awaited adjustment to the price of LNG
will come in January.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Timing of resuming form of short-selling needs more study: FSC</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) will conduct a thorough review before
deciding whether the short selling of stocks at prices below the closing levels
of the previous trading day should be resumed by the end of this year, the
country's new top financial regulator said Monday.</P>
      <P>Sean Chen, a former vice minister of finance, made the remarks after taking over
as FSC chairman earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>The FSC allowed resumption of short sales of stocks at prices above the previous
closing levels last Friday, backpedaling on an all-out ban on short selling that
took effect Oct. 1 and was to have remained valid until the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Some  securities  analysts  have advocated  further  easing restrictions on
short selling, such as resuming short sales of stocks at prices below the
previous closing levels, prior to the original year-end deadline.</P>
      <P>Chen, who once served as chairman of the Taiwan Stock Exchange, said short
selling of stocks at prices below the previous closing levels is not an evil,
but the timing to resume such trade is very important.</P>
      <P>In his view, Chen said, the mechanism allowing investors to short sell at prices
below the previous day's close should contain a "buyback"  provision to cushion
its possible impact on market stability.</P>
      <P>Noting that the FSC has many experienced staff members, Chen said he will listen
to their opinions as a reference in determining whether the temporary ban on
short selling at prices lower than the previous close should be lifted ahead of
schedule or remain in place until the end of this year as originally scheduled.</P>
      <P>The FSC imposed the total short selling ban Oct. 1 at the height of global
financial turmoil. With world financial markets gradually stabilizing, the
financial regulatory body lifted the ban partially Nov. 28 by allowing short
sales of stocks at prices above the previous closing levels as part of its
efforts to spur market liquidity and trading volume.</P>
      <P>After taking over the helm at the FSC from his predecessor Gordon Chen at a
changeover ceremony, Sean Chen said his top priority was to help the local
financial community tide over the lingering global credit crunch and financial
meltdown.</P>
      <P>As a first step, Chen said, he will supervise local financial institutions in
reinforcing their risk management capability and coordinate with other
government agencies to implement the policy of "the government backing banks,
banks backing business, and business backing labor" during this time of economic
volatility.</P>

      <P>A visit to Taiwan by the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, would
be politically sensitive, and will be left to the country's security agencies to
decide, the head of the Cabinet-level Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Minister Kao Su-po said the commission would like to see his visit, but security
authorities will make an assessment and come to a decision first.</P>
      <P>Kao made the remarks after the Dalai Lama, in an interview with the Hong Kong-
based weekly Yazhou Zhoukan, said to forge friendly relations with Chinese
sisters and brothers and to have exchanges with Buddhist followers, he would
like to visit Taiwan again if the chance arises.</P>
      <P>"The commission attaches great importance to the Dalai Lama's possible  visit,
given his high profile in the international community," Kao said.</P>
      <P>But in view of China's concerns wherever he goes, "when will be the appropriate
time for the visit and how to arrange his meetings with political heavyweights
in Taiwan will be an issue that requires careful thought,' Kao said.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama has visited Taiwan twice, in 1997 and 2001, respectively.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Airing of Taiwan-produced film in China might be delayed: GIO</HEADLINE>

      <P>There might be a delay in the scheduled screening of a locally produced box
office hit in China, but it does not necessarily mean the plan has been dropped,
the Government Information Office (GIO) said Monday.</P>
      <P>The United Daily News, a local daily, reported Monday that China has suspended a
plan to show "Cape No.7" prior to Chinese New Year, which falls on January 26,
citing Beijing-based newspaper Legal Mirror.</P>
      <P>Although the exact reason for the postponement was unclear, it is known that
China's top negotiator with Taiwan, Chen Yunlin, said in a seminar last week
that the film touches on Japan's colonization of Taiwan from 1895 to 1945.</P>
      <P>The reports suggested that the top brass in Beijing worried that the airing of
the film might whip up nationalistic sentiment in China.</P>
      <P>Frank Chen, director of the GIO's Department of Motion Picture Affairs, said
that Wang Ying-shyang, chairman of Taiwan's Long Shong Film Co., the distributor
of the film, visited the GIO Monday to explain the distribution and screening of
the film in China.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, Long Shong received an e-mail from China Nov. 19 saying that
there were still technical problems to be coordinated, and that Long Shong
should hold off on sending the film to China pending further notification.</P>
      <P>Judging from Wang's explanation, the screening of the film in China should be
seen as being "delayed," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said that Cape No. 7, a romantic comedy set in Hengchun, Pingtung that has
parallel plots set in the present day and 60 years ago at the end of the
colonial period, is a film about relationships between people that will "touch
the hearts of all Chinese."</P>
      <P>"If Chinese people can also watch the film, it will help cultural exchanges
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait," he insisted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) blasted China for
viewing the film from a political perspective.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Pan Meng-an noted that after watching the movie during his visit to
Taiwan Nov. 3-7 in his capacity as the president of the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, Chen Yunlin said "Taiwan's sea is
beautiful, Hengchun is beautiful, and the Malasan millet wine tastes good," and
he expressed his hope to see Hengchun one day.</P>
      <P>But his attitude changed after returning to China, and he has now attempted to
ban the film from showing in China, Pan said, which the lawmaker suggested was a
decision made purely "from the perspective of a political angle."</P>
      <P>As of the end of November, the film had taken in NT$459.15 million (US$13.91
million), becoming the second top grossing film in the island's cinematic
history, behind Titanic.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Market mechanisms to decide charter flight fares: CAA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 1 (CNA)
12/01/08  22:39:51
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Responding to a consumer group's appeal that fares for daily nonstop charter
flights between Taiwan and China be reduced, the Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA) said Monday that ticket prices should be decided by market
mechanisms.</P>
      <P>The Consumers' Foundation suggested earlier Monday that fares for the cross-
Taiwan Strait charters, to be operated on a daily basis beginning Dec. 15,
should be slashed by about 42 percent to reflect plummeting oil prices and
straighter routes that will not require carriers to pass through Hong Kong or
Macau air space.</P>
      <P>Under a 42 percent fare cut, the price of a one-way economy class ticket between
Taipei and Shanghai on the weekend could be reduced by between NT$8,100 and
NT$10,500 (US$326), according to the foundation.</P>
      <P>If the cross-strait charter flight prices cannot be effectively cut, foreign
carriers should be allowed to compete in the market, which at present is only
open to Taiwan- and China-based carriers, the foundation said.</P>
      <P>The group also raised concerns that the fares for the new nonstop direct cross-
strait charters operating from Tuesday to Thursday would be even higher than the
current fares for flights that transit through Hong Kong or Macau.</P>
      <P>The CAA did not dispute the foundation's assertion, saying greater market demand
and fewer flights would certainly push up prices, and that it would respect
market mechanisms.</P>
      <P>The CAA said, for example, that fares for current weekend nonstop cross-strait
charter flights (implemented since July on Friday through Monday) are already
higher than those for flights transiting through a third country or area.</P>
      <P>Prices for charter flights, regardless of international or cross-strait routes,
are usually jointly determined by tour agencies and aviation companies without
being reviewed in advance by the CAA, CAA officials said.</P>

      <P>Motorbike owners around Taiwan have until Dec. 15 to hand over two-stroke
motorcycles that are at least seven years old in exchange for a cash subsidy of
NT$1,500, environmental officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) has set aside
NT$525 million (US$15.75 million) since January 2007 for the program, hoping to
phase out 350,000 aged two-stroke motorcycles that are blamed for much of the
air pollution in Taiwan's cities.</P>
      <P>According to the EPA officials, two-stroke motorcycles generate up to five times
more air pollution than the four-stroke motorcycles of a similar age.</P>
      <P>The three-year program is also part of the Cabinet's efforts to echo calls by
the international community to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      <P>Cities and counties around Taiwan have been given different quotas each year on
how many old but still running two-stroke motorcycles they can accept in return
for subsidies.</P>
      <P>For example, in 2008, Taipei County has a quota of 6,000, while the quotas for
other districts are 5,000 for Taipei City, 5,500 for Tainan County, 2,000 for
Miaoli County, 200 for the island county of Penghu, and 100 for the island
county of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>The program first began in Kaohsiung City, Kaohsiung County and Pingtung County
in southern Taiwan in 2007 and was expanded in 2008 to cover all other cities
and counties in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>By the end of November this year, more than 30,000 motorcycle owners in the port
city of Kaohsiung and the counties of Kaohsiung and Pingtung had cashed in on
the program by turning in their old two-stroke bikes to licensed factories for
recycling.</P>

three-day forum beginning Saturday at Taiwan's Academia Sinica in celebration of
its 80th anniversary, Chi-Huey Wong, the institute's president, said at a news

      <P>A total of 15 academic heads from 13 countries will meet from Dec. 6-8 to
contribute to discussions on the "Roles of the Academies in Creating a Better
world," Wong said.</P>
      <P>The forum's topics include how modern science academies will drive and
contribute to knowledge-based  development and solve environmental problems.</P>
      <P>Steven Chu, a co-winner of the 1997 Nobel Prize in Physics, and Ralph Cicerone,
president of U.S. National Academy of Sciences, will each give a keynote speech
on the first day of the forum, Wong said.</P>
      <P>Wong said this is the first time that the world's academic leaders will meet to

      <P>He said Academia Sinica spent more than a year preparing the forum, and that he

leaders to the event.</P>
      <P>Wong said Academia Sinica currently has no plans to turn the meeting into a

    <HEADLINE>Lawmakers want standard income tax deduction raised to NT$73,000</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan's Finance Committee on Monday approved amendments to the
Income Tax Act submitted by the Cabinet after further raising the standard
individual income tax deduction from the NT$60,000 proposed by the ministry to
NT$73,000.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendments are to Clause One of Article Five, Article 17 and
Article 126 of the Income Tax Act.</P>
      <P>The amendments originally proposed increasing  the standard deduction for
individual tax filers from the current NT$46,000 to NT$60,000 and from NT$92,000
to NT$120,000 for a married couple.</P>
      <P>But the Finance Committee raised it further to NT$73,000 for an unmarried
taxpayer and to NT$146,000 for a married couple.</P>
      <P>The increases on three other deductions proposed by the Cabinet remained
unchanged.</P>
      <P>A salary or wage earner's special deduction would be increased from NT$78,000
per salary or wage earner to NT$NT$100,000, while the deduction for the disabled
would also be raised from the current NT$77,000 per disabled person to
NT$100,000.</P>
      <P>The amendments would also grant a deduction of NT$25,000 per student in each
household to help cover higher education expenses, instead of the current
NT$25,000 for each tax return.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der, who gave a report on the
proposed legislation, told reporters that the Cabinet had reached a consensus
with lawmakers that the four increased individual income tax deductions allowed
by the amendments would be applicable in May 2009 when taxpayers file their 2008
returns.</P>
      <P>Lee said the Ministry of Finance has estimated that the four increased
deductions would affect 3.6 million families in Taiwan, accounting for 69
percent of the 5.18 million households that file tax returns each year.</P>
      <P>According to law, the amendments adopted in 2008 should be implemented only in
2010, making them good for the 2009 income tax returns. But legislators of the
ruling Kuomintang said this will not be a problem, because they will introduce
another amendment to allow the newly increased deductions to be applied to the
2008 tax year.</P>
      <P>Individual income tax is levied on Taiwan-source income of both resident and
non-resident individuals per calendar year.</P>
      <P>Individuals are considered residents in Taiwan for tax purposes if they are
Republic of China citizens or if they are foreign nationals who reside in Taiwan
for at least 183 days within a calendar year.</P>
      <P>They are subject to income tax on all their income that originates in Taiwan and
must file income tax returns and pay taxes between May 1 and 31 of the following
year.</P>
      <P>The incomes of the taxpayer, taxpayer's spouse, and dependents must be
consolidated and reported on one income tax return. Resident taxpayers are
allowed to claim personal exemptions and deductions on their tax returns.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's state-run petroleum refiner, CPC Corp., Taiwan announced Monday that it
will slash the domestic price of low sulfur fuel oil by 37.68 percent, the
largest price reduction in history.</P>
      <P>The price for low sulfur fuel oil will be lowered by NT$5,802 (US$173.5) per
kiloliter to NT$9,595, while the price of low sulfur boiler fuel oil will be cut
by NT$5,625 per kiloliter to NT$11,092, according to a CPC statement.</P>
      <P>The adjustment will take effect from midnight Monday.</P>
      <P>CPC officials  attributed  the price  cut to the plunging international price of
crude oil, which has dropped to around US$50 per barrel.</P>
      <P>Following Monday's price cuts, domestic fuel oil prices will have fallen back to
their level of April 2007, and many will be watching to see if the price
reductions will relieve cost pressures on local businesses and trigger drops in
the prices of daily commodities.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, CPC also announced it will cut the wholesale price for liquefied
petroleum gas (LPG) in December by NT$5.75 per kilogram to NT$16.64.</P>
      <P>Under the adjustment, also to take effect at midnight Monday, the price for a 20
kg cylinder of household LPG will be lowered to NT$115, according to CPC.</P>
      <P>Liquefied natural gas (LNG) , however, was not included in the latest round of
price decreases. The company explained it was because the company has not yet
received reference price reports indicating an obvious drop in prices.</P>
      <P>CPC officials speculated that the long-awaited adjustment to the price of LNG
will come in January.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Timing of resuming form of short-selling needs more study: FSC</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) will conduct a thorough review before
deciding whether the short selling of stocks at prices below the closing levels
of the previous trading day should be resumed by the end of this year, the
country's new top financial regulator said Monday.</P>
      <P>Sean Chen, a former vice minister of finance, made the remarks after taking over
as FSC chairman earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>The FSC allowed resumption of short sales of stocks at prices above the previous
closing levels last Friday, backpedaling on an all-out ban on short selling that
took effect Oct. 1 and was to have remained valid until the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Some  securities  analysts  have advocated  further  easing restrictions on
short selling, such as resuming short sales of stocks at prices below the
previous closing levels, prior to the original year-end deadline.</P>
      <P>Chen, who once served as chairman of the Taiwan Stock Exchange, said short
selling of stocks at prices below the previous closing levels is not an evil,
but the timing to resume such trade is very important.</P>
      <P>In his view, Chen said, the mechanism allowing investors to short sell at prices
below the previous day's close should contain a "buyback"  provision to cushion
its possible impact on market stability.</P>
      <P>Noting that the FSC has many experienced staff members, Chen said he will listen
to their opinions as a reference in determining whether the temporary ban on
short selling at prices lower than the previous close should be lifted ahead of
schedule or remain in place until the end of this year as originally scheduled.</P>
      <P>The FSC imposed the total short selling ban Oct. 1 at the height of global
financial turmoil. With world financial markets gradually stabilizing, the
financial regulatory body lifted the ban partially Nov. 28 by allowing short
sales of stocks at prices above the previous closing levels as part of its
efforts to spur market liquidity and trading volume.</P>
      <P>After taking over the helm at the FSC from his predecessor Gordon Chen at a
changeover ceremony, Sean Chen said his top priority was to help the local
financial community tide over the lingering global credit crunch and financial
meltdown.</P>
      <P>As a first step, Chen said, he will supervise local financial institutions in
reinforcing their risk management capability and coordinate with other
government agencies to implement the policy of "the government backing banks,
banks backing business, and business backing labor" during this time of economic
volatility.</P>

      <P>The forum's topics include how modern science academies will drive and
contribute to knowledge-based  development and solve environmental problems.</P>
      <P>Steven Chu, a co-winner of the 1997 Nobel Prize in Physics, and Ralph Cicerone,
president of U.S. National Academy of Sciences, will each give a keynote speech
on the first day of the forum, Wong said.</P>
      <P>Wong said this is the first time that the world's academic leaders will meet to
focus on issues they all care about.</P>
      <P>He said Academia Sinica spent more than a year preparing the forum, and that he
and former Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh jointly invited academic
leaders to the event.</P>
      <P>Wong said Academia Sinica currently has no plans to turn the meeting into a
regular annual event in the future. It is more likely, he said, that the
institute will send representatives to similar events held by other countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CPC fuel oil prices undergo largest cut in history</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 1 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's state-run petroleum refiner, CPC Corp., Taiwan announced Monday that it
will slash the domestic price of low sulfur fuel oil by 37.68 percent, the
largest price reduction in history.</P>
      <P>The price for low sulfur fuel oil will be lowered by NT$5,802 (US$173.5) per
kiloliter to NT$9,595, while the price of low sulfur boiler fuel oil will be cut
by NT$5,625 per kiloliter to NT$11,092, according to a CPC statement.</P>
      <P>The adjustment will take effect from midnight Monday.</P>
      <P>CPC officials  attributed  the price  cut to the plunging international price of
crude oil, which has dropped to around US$50 per barrel.</P>
      <P>Following Monday's price cuts, domestic fuel oil prices will have fallen back to
their level of April 2007, and many will be watching to see if the price
reductions will relieve cost pressures on local businesses and trigger drops in
the prices of daily commodities.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, CPC also announced it will cut the wholesale price for liquefied
petroleum gas (LPG) in December by NT$5.75 per kilogram to NT$16.64.</P>
      <P>Under the adjustment, also to take effect at midnight Monday, the price for a 20
kg cylinder of household LPG will be lowered to NT$115, according to CPC.</P>
      <P>Liquefied natural gas (LNG) , however, was not included in the latest round of
price decreases. The company explained it was because the company has not yet
received reference price reports indicating an obvious drop in prices.</P>
      <P>CPC officials speculated that the long-awaited adjustment to the price of LNG
will come in January.</P>

      <P>A visit to Taiwan by the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, would
be politically sensitive, and will be left to the country's security agencies to
decide, the head of the Cabinet-level Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Minister Kao Su-po said the commission would like to see his visit, but security
authorities will make an assessment and come to a decision first.</P>
      <P>Kao made the remarks after the Dalai Lama, in an interview with the Hong Kong-
based weekly Yazhou Zhoukan, said to forge friendly relations with Chinese
sisters and brothers and to have exchanges with Buddhist followers, he would
like to visit Taiwan again if the chance arises.</P>
      <P>"The commission attaches great importance to the Dalai Lama's possible  visit,
given his high profile in the international community," Kao said.</P>
      <P>But in view of China's concerns wherever he goes, "when will be the appropriate
time for the visit and how to arrange his meetings with political heavyweights
in Taiwan will be an issue that requires careful thought,' Kao said.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama has visited Taiwan twice, in 1997 and 2001, respectively.</P>

would carry out, what heaven abominated they refrained from."</TEXT>

      <P>The Red Cross Society of the Republic of China will visit areas of Sichuan
province that were devastated by an earthquake in May, society officials said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>C.V. Chen, president of Taiwan's Red Cross Society, and his group will arrive in
Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan in southwestern China, Wednesday night, to join
an advance team of the society.</P>
      <P>Starting Thursday, Chen's group will travel to cities that were ravaged by the
magnitude-8.0 earthquake that struck Sichuan province May 12.</P>
      <P>Red Cross Society officials said Chen will sign a cooperation agreement on post-
quake reconstruction with his Red Cross Society counterparts in China.</P>
      <P>He will also attend a groundbreaking ceremony for a rehabilitation center for
the disabled in Abazhou as well as distribute comforters and other relief
supplies donated by people in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The society intends to spend NT$1.375 billion (US$41.42 million) in remote parts

    <HEADLINE>Danshui River's pollution on the decline: EPA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.   2  (CNA)
12/02/08  16:08:34
(By Andrew Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan's Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) said Tuesday
that efforts to clean up the Danshui River have delivered tangible improvements,
including an increase in marine life in the river.</P>
      <P>"The length of the Danshui River that is polluted has decreased by 54.6
kilometers, said EPA Deputy Minister Chang Tzi-chin at a press conference. "The
water quality is improving rapidly. The number of fish have also greatly
increased.</P>
      <P>Chang said that through the joint efforts of the local and central governments,
only 4.5 percent of the full length of the river was polluted at the end of
October, down from 21.4 percent of the river being polluted in 2002.</P>
      <P>We are cleaning up the river by dredging mud from the river's floor and by
posting guards to patrol it to prevent people from dumping waste there," Chang
said.</P>
      <P>One positive consequence of the cleanup efforts has been the revitalization of
marine life. According to EPA data, the number of species of fish that can be
found now has increased, a development confirmed by the observations of local
residents.</P>
      <P>"The cleanup of the river has made great strides. I have received phone calls
from people who live near the river who told me the number of fish has
increased, " Chang said.</P>
      <P>He also pointed to progress made in eliminating the river's foul smell that
tarnished any visit to the river's banks.</P>
      <P>"The stench was especially obvious when the tide retreated. Now, as the river is
being cleaned up, the smell is gone," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Improving the Danshui River entails more, however, than simply cleaning  its
waters.  It also  includes  the development  of infrastructure such as planting
trees along the river and building bicycle paths, the EPA official stressed.</P>
      <P>The 159-kilometer Danshui River originates on Pintien Mountain in Hsinchu County
and winds its way through Hsinchu County, Taoyuan County, Taipei City and Taipei
County before emptying into the Taiwan Strait.</P>

      <P>Some 13,000 Amway China employees are set to visit Taiwan on a cruise next
March, which will give a boost to the island's  tourism  industry,  Minister  of
Transportation  and Communications Mao Chi-kuo said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In a report during a visit to the ministry by Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, Mao said
the visit will be handled as a special case and not be subject to the quota of
3,000 Chinese tourists to Taiwan per day.</P>
      <P>Mao said the Amway China employees will be making the tour as part of the
company's annual bonus trip and to take part in an overseas training seminar in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The employees will visit in several groups on cruise liners from Shanghai to
Keelung Harbor and Taichung Harbor, Mao said.</P>
      <P>Although regulations on Chinese tourist visits to Taiwan limit travel to the
island to residents of 13 specified Chinese provinces, the Amway China employees
taking part in the tour come from all over the country, Mao said.</P>
      <P>He added that according to the ministry's understanding, Chinese authorities
have also agreed to handle the tour as a special case, separate from the daily

      <P>The Legislative Yuan's Procedure Committee on Tuesday placed a bill that would
allow the government to fund its consumer voucher program by issuing debt on the
legislative agenda for discussion Friday.</P>
      <P>The government's plan to provide vouchers valued at NT$3,600 (US$110) to each

third reading, it will enable the Executive Yuan to submit the legislation
covering the actual voucher program before noon next Monday.</P>
      <P>Under an expedited screening process, the voucher program bill could then be
approved by the legislature by the end of the month, giving the government time
to issue the vouchers by its target date of Jan. 18 -- one full week ahead of

      <P>The number of people who were infected with HIV through sexual contact is rising
in Taoyuan County, which indicated a lack of awareness about safe sex, Taoyuan
health authorities said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>During the first 10 months of this year, a total of 123 new HIV/AIDS cases were
recorded in the northern Taiwanese county, 90 of which resulted from unprotected
sex, according to statistics compiled by the county's public health bureau.</P>
      <P>The figure compares with 91 new cases recorded during the whole of 2007 and
marks a sharp increase from 2003 and 2004, when there were around 60 new cases a
year, the statistics showed.</P>
      <P>Among the new cases recorded from January to October 2008, 40 percent were in
the 20-29 age group, and 6 percent were in the 15-19 age group.</P>
      <P>Lin Hsueh-jung, head of the bureau, said the situation is a cause for concern as
it shows that HIV/AIDS awareness among the general public remains low, even as
the government's efforts to control HIV infections among intravenous drug users
have been proven successful.</P>
      <P>Statistics from the bureau revealed that in 2007, there were 89 new cases in
which intravenous drug users were infected with HIV after sharing needles with
HIV carriers. The number accounted for 52 percent of all new HIV infections for
the year, which totaled 169.</P>
      <P>During the first 10 months of 2008, the number of new HIV infections involving
an intravenous drug user stood at 27, accounting for 26 percent of all new cases

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) urged Taiwanese travelers Tuesday to take
the necessary precautions to avoid becoming embroiled in drug-trafficking, a
serious crime in many popular Southeast Asian destinations.</P>
      <P>Victor  Yu,  director-general  of MOFA's  East  Asian  and Pacific Affairs,
issued the warning at a press conference after a report from the Indonesian
government indicated 23 individuals -- 13 of them Taiwanese nationals -- were
caught with drugs at the country's gateways in the past eight months.</P>
      <P>Some of the Taiwanese nationals had been severely punished, Yu said, while
others are still in the process of trials.</P>
      <P>In addition, over 110 Taiwanese nationals are still serving sentences for drug-
trafficking  and other drug-related crimes in Thailand, Yu said.</P>
      <P>Although the ministrys representative office in Bangkok has managed over the
past two years to help some Taiwanese convicts be released early or have their
sentences reduced, Yu said differences between Taiwan's judicial systems and
those in Southeast Asian limit the potential effectiveness of any government
assistance efforts.</P>
      <P>To avoid being unwittingly implicated in a drug-trafficking case, Yu suggested
that local travelers avoid carrying packages for strangers and pack their own
bags when traveling to countries in which drug-trafficking is widespread.</P>

      <P>Another cold snap, lasting about five days, will affect northern and central
Taiwan from Dec. 4, sending temperatures in some areas to as low as 10 degrees
Celsius, the Central Weather Bureau forecast Tuesday.</P>
      <P>CWB meteorologists said the cold snap is due to a continental cold air mass that
is forecast to move into the Taiwan area on the evening of Nov. 4.</P>
      <P>They said early morning temperatures in northern and central Taiwan, covering
the areas of Taipei and Taichung, could drop to 10 degrees Celsius Dec. 6-7
before rising slightly to between 12 degrees and 14 degrees Celsius on Dec. 8,
while daytime temperatures are expected to range between 21 degrees and 24

      <P>The Taipei City Zoo said Tuesday that it plans to send two Formosan sika deers
to mainland China as soon as it receives a pair of giant pandas from China, and
that the deers will be at optimum mating age.</P>
      <P>Zoo official Chao Ming-chie said the zoo currently owns a herd of 10 Formosan

couple that are both aged between 1 and 5 to serve as Taiwan's goodwill
ambassadors to China.</P>
      <P>The deer, endemic to Taiwan, enjoys a life span of 20 years, and develops a
breeding ability at the age 2. As a result, deers that are 1 to 5 years old are

      <P>In addition to the Formosan sika deers, the zoo will also present China a pair
of Formosan goat, also a rare indigenous animal, as a gift.</P>
      <P>The pandas are expected to be delivered to Taipei's zoo in mid December.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Zoo's Chao said a stag will begin to grow antlers on the head at
around 2 years old, which will then grow an additional fork each year until it
is five years old.</P>
      <P>In the breeding season that normally begins in October and ends in January, male
deers will use their horns as a weapon in fights for leadership and the right to
mate with a female.</P>
      <P>The gestation period of a mother deer is over 300 days, according to Chao.</P>
      <P>According to the zoo, the grass-eating Formosan sika deer, known for white spots
on its back, can grow to 1.5 meters long. A doe is smaller and has no antler.
Its coat changes color in different seasons from chestnut red in the summer to
light brown in the winter.</P>
      <P>Many of the spotted deer were killed during massive hunting in 1624 when the
Dutch occupied Taiwan, with the catch volume reaching 150,000 heads a year.
Until the year of 1662 when a Chinese military leader, Zheng Chenggong, defeated
the Dutch to claim Taiwan, deer skin was one of Taiwan's most important exports.</P>
      <P>According to Taipei City Zoo's Director Jason Yeh, the Formosan sika deer
disappeared from the wild in Taiwan in 1969 when the last wild deer died.</P>
      <P>As part of the country's efforts to preserve the native animal, the city zoo
joined a conservation program in 1986, transporting 22 pure-blood captive-raised
deers to the Kenting National Park in southern Taiwan in an effort to revive the
deer's population in the wild.</P>
      <P>Since 1994, the national park has set free a total of 50 Formosan sika deers in
the wild. According to a survey conducted by Kenting park authorities in 2003,
the number of the wild deers has reached 108-156.</P>

      <P>National Chiayi University (NCYU) in Chiayi County, southern Taiwan, has signed
a memorandum of understanding on academic cooperation  with Spain's University
of Huelva,  NCYU President Lee Ming-jen said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The MOU was inked by Lee and his Spanish counterpart Francisco Jose Martinez
Lopez Monday, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee said the MOU will allow for exchanges of teaching personnel and students
between the two schools and cooperation in opening joint courses and research
projects.</P>
      <P>The NCYU was established in 2000 by combining an existing technology school and
an education college.</P>
      <P>Today,  NCYU has four campuses  and six colleges covering disciplines from
agriculture and life sciences to art and is especially known for its
agricultural programs.</P>
      <P>The University of Huelva was founded in 1993. It has 10,400 students in nine
colleges on four campuses.</P>
      <P>In addition to academic exchanges, the benefits of the MOU will include NCYU
gaining access to the Spanish school's resources in art, as the University of
Huelva is located in Andalusia in southern Spain which is renowned for its
diverse culture, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>For its part, the Spanish school will send more students to NCYU, Martinez said,
noting that at present there is only one.</P>
      <P>The Spanish university has been making efforts to promote eastern cultures and
Chinese learning, Lee said. Its Asian culture center, whose director Grace Mun
Man Shum also attended Monday's signing ceremony, worked with Taiwan's Education
of Ministry to organize a Taiwan culture week on University of Huelva's campuses
last October.</P>
      <P>NCYU has signed MOUs with 30 academic institutions throughout the world in an
effort to access more resources and broaden the international perspective of its
students, Lee said.</P>

      <P>A series of experiments has recently led to the discovery of an alkaloid-based
compound that can efficiently kill various kinds of cancer cells and could be

      <P>The compound "antofine" is made from alkaloids extracted from herbs such as
cryptocarya chinensis and ficus septica, said Wu Tian-shung, the project's
leader and a chemistry professor at the Tainan- based National Cheng Kung

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of AIDS patients in Taiwan has continued to increase, with more
youths falling victim to the deadly disease, the Christian charity World Vision
Taiwan (WVT) warned in a statement Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Quoting statistics compiled by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) under the
Department of Health, WVT said a total of 16,968 people were reported to have
been infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, between 1984 and the end of
September 2008, with an annual increase of more than 1,000 cases.</P>
      <P>Most of the victims are in their prime, ages 20 to 40, and the number of HIV
carriers in the 10-19 age group has also been increasing steadily, according to
the statement.</P>
      <P>Chu Yu-hsin, a WVT deputy project director, said many youngsters have come down
with HIV through casual sexual encounters or by sharing needles with HIV-
carrying intravenous drug users.</P>
      <P>Noting that most of these youngsters are from problem or broken families, Chu
said the local society should show more concern and care for them and help them
value themselves and develop sober judgment.</P>
      <P>"By so doing, the youngsters will be less likely to fall victim to drug
addiction or the sex trade, which would in turn reduce the risk of them becoming
infected with HIV," Chu explained.</P>
      <P>Chu also urged local people and business groups to donate money for educational
programs to help enhance public awareness and wipe out the discriminatory
attitude toward AIDS patients or HIV carriers.</P>
      <P>Donations are also needed to finance aid or care for children orphaned by AIDS,
Chu added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  a previous study by National Taiwan University Hospital showed that
delay in seeking diagnosis or treatment of HIV could increase the chances of
death by 20 percent to 30 percent.</P>
      <P>Statistics on new HIV cases in Taiwan compiled by the Center for Disease Control
showed that homosexual males accounted for 46 percent of the 728 cases certified
as HIV-positive between January and May this year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) reelected as chairman Chiang Pin-kung
during its board meeting on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Kao Koong-lian, an incumbent SEF vice chairman, Fu Don-Cheng, a vice chairman of
the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, and Rock Hsu, chairman of Kinpo
Group, were named as SEF's vice chairmen. Kao was also re-appointed as the
secretary general of the SEF.</P>
      <P>Chiang, an experienced technocrat who has served as minister of economic affairs
and chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, first assumed
the SEF chairmanship May 26, shortly after the May 20 inauguration of President
Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Many in Taiwan's political circles say that Chiang is an economic and trade
expert with hands-on mainland experience. Some even say that Chiang Pin-kung is
a SEF chairman qualified to be premier.</P>
      <P>In a speech delivered after his reelection as SEF chief, Chiang said that in the
future, both the SEF and its Chinese counterpart -- the Association for
Relations Acros the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) -- will engage in crime fighting,
expansion of mechanisms for food safety inspections and enhancement of
quarantine procedures for dairy products.</P>
      <P>"The Straits  Exchange  Foundation  and ARATS have reached agreements on the
priority issues to discuss in the next round of talks, " said Chiang, referring
to a third round of talks scheduled to be held in mainland China in the first
half of next year.</P>
      <P>Chiang noted that other cross-strait matters that will be dealt with include:
financial, investment, industrial,  fisheries and cultural cooperation.</P>
      <P>"These issues will be negotiated in a step-by-step process. The respective
government agencies will engage in negotiations of the detailed agreements,"
Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Chiang  Pin-kung ,  also  a vice  chairman  of the  ruling Kuomintang, was
tapped to be SEF chairman shortly after the KMT regained power in May. This
makes him in effect responsible for the front line negotiations with the
mainland Chinese government.</P>
      <P>In March 2005, Chiang led the KMT's first official delegation to mainland China
since the end of major hostilities in the Chinese Civil War in 1949. During the
trip, Chiang promoted opening the three links and economic development between
Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chiang's experience in cross-strait affairs made him the key man in the last two
rounds of SEF and ARATS talks. He is considered by many as the most prominent
figure to represent Taiwan in cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>SEF and its mainland Chinese counterpart, the Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) , are quasi governmental organizations empowered to
handle cross-strait negotiations in the absence of formal government-to-
government relations between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Talks between SEF and ARATS were stalled for years during the previous
administrations in Taiwan, which had upset Beijing with their pro-independence
stance.</P>
      <P>Talks resumed this year for the first time in about a decade, after the more
China friendly President Ma Ying-jeou took office.</P>
      <P>In the second round of talks held early last month, Chiang and ARATS President
Chen Yunlin signed four major agreements to establish direct shipping and postal
links, expand flight services and create a mechanism to address food safety
issues.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Lawmaker wants Kaohsiung port development included in special bill</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Huang Chao-shun called Tuesday for Kaohsiung City's
air and sea ports to be included  in an airport development  bill so to sharpen
the competitiveness of the two southern Taiwan ports.</P>
      <P>Huang issued the call at a seminar that she sponsored with the aim of exploring
public opinion on ways to increase the international competitive edge of the two
local ports.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan is set to screen a special bill Wednesday on the
development and upgrade of Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport in northern
Taiwan. However, as the bill deals only with Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport in the north, Huang contended that Kaohsiung International Airport and
the Kaohsiung Harbor should also be included to allow for their development as
an aviation park and a free trade port zone, respectively.</P>
      <P>To that end, Huang said, she will propose amendments to every clause in the bill
when it comes up for screening by the Legislature Wednesday. The government is
hoping that the bill will be passed to develop the area adjacent to Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport as an aviation park.</P>
      <P>If the bill is passed with the inclusion of the two ports, the Kaohsiung city
government will have to make an all out effort to bring the ports up to a level
with those in the north, she urged.</P>
      <P>Wang Ming-sheng, a professor at National Sun Yat-sen University in Kaohsiung
City, called on the city government to seize the development opportunities that
would arise with the planned opening of direct shipping services between Taiwan
and China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China representatives inked four cooperation accords Nov. 4 in
Taipei, one of which was to establish direct shipping links across the Taiwan
Strait. To that end, China will open 28 of its ports for business with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the Kaohsiung city government has failed in its efforts to make
its sea port into a free trade zone and he suggested that transparent
participation by the public in the development of the city and its two ports
should be allowed.</P>
      <P>Civil Aeronautics Administration Director-General Lee Lung-wen expressed  the
view that there  is ample  room for Kaohsiung International Airport to further
develop once its cargo and passenger transportation volumes increase.</P>
      <P>The number of commercial passenger flights at the Taoyuan airport is six times
that at the Kaohsiung airport, while the number of cargo flights is 25 times
that at the Kaohsiung airport, Lee noted.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Transportation and Communications Oliver F. L. Yu contended
that  the  competitiveness  of the  increasingly marginalized Kaohsiung Port can
be boosted by relaxing the special law.</P>
      <P>Thanks to its strategic location and large hinterland in the neighboring
Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties, the Kaohsiung Port stands a good chance of
being transformed into a flourishing commercial business district, Yu said.</P>
      <P>He said the Taoyuan airport will first undergo development in line with the law,
as long as the international airport development special bill clears the
Legislative Yuan, and the law can then be applied to the Kaohsiung airport if
its passenger transportation volume is large enough.</P>

      <P>Several environmental groups in Taiwan on Tuesday protested against the imports
of U.S. beef and called for a boycott against the products, arguing that they
endanger public health and the environment.</P>
      <P>Pan Han-sheng, secretary-general of the Green Party, said the health of the
public will only be ensured if U.S. beef is banned from being imported to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Pan noted at a news conference held outside the Department of Health that
although the Executive Yuan recently passed a draft bill governing the organic
law of the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (TFDA), in an effort to
strengthen the safety of food and drugs, the bill will not ensure the safety of
U.S. beef.</P>
      <P>An alliance to fight against global warming also staged a skit, plastering a
U.S. cattle doll with stickers that read "bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE)", "supervirus that is drug-resistant", and "growth hormones that could
induce cancer".</P>
      <P>The alliance said that U.S. cattle is raised in a large-scale way and that the
cereal fed to them could be polluted with chemicals, posing bigger threat to
health than melamine tainted milk products from China.</P>
      <P>The alliance called for a boycott of U.S. beef, saying that it will help take
care the public's health and the environment as well as ensure food safety.</P>
      <P>Taiwan banned U.S. beef in 2003 when a case of BSE was diagnosed in Seattle. The
ban was lifted in April 2005 to allow imports of U.S. de-boned beef from cattle
aged under 30 months, but the Taiwan government re-imposed the ban two months
later when a second BSE case was discovered in the United States.</P>
      <P>The DOH lifted the ban on Jan. 25, 2006, but had to reinstate it four months
later when bone fragments were discovered in a beef shipment.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently only allows boneless beef from cattle younger than 30 months of
age, produced from certificated slaughterhouses and without high risk items such
as brains and spinal cord marrow to be imported.</P>
      <P>The U.S. has called for Taiwan to fully open the market to its beef.</P>

Administration Minister Chen Ching-hsiou announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The announcement ended debate on whether to adjust the length of the New Year
holiday -- normally a single day -- after the legislative caucus of the ruling
Kuomintang proposed prolonging the first holiday of 2009 to include Jan. 2,
because Jan. 1 falls on a Thursday, a move that would give people the two days
plus the following two-day weekend.</P>

while the additional Friday -- which would be a work day under normal
circumstances -- can be made up by taking away a Saturday later in the year.</P>
      <P>The proposal, however, drew opposition from Tsai Lien-sheng, secretary-general

      <P>The Pheasant-tailed Jacana Park in Guantien township in Tainan County, southern
Taiwan has succeeded in boosting the population of the endangered species while
developing as a safe nesting  place  for both migratory  and indigenous
waterfowl, conservationists said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The conservationists of the Taipei-based Chinese Wild Bird Federation said the
population of the pheasant-tailed jacana -- selected as the Tainan County bird
-- has increased to nearly 300 in the Guantien area alone, from fewer than 50
all over Taiwan just 10 years ago.</P>
      <P>The federation attributed the achievement to recovery efforts by the county
government-run park, which was built in 1998 with a subsidy from the Taiwan High
Speed Rail Corp. in response to local activists' calls for protection of the
indigenous water bird.</P>
      <P>Construction of the railway had destroyed an area of wetland where the birds
formerly lived.</P>
      <P>The pheasant-tailed jacana, or hydrophasia nus chirurgus, is a beautiful bird
that breeds in ponds or wetland areas and sports a long pheasant-like tail while
in its breeding plumage, hence its common name.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, jacana usually congregate in water chestnut fields, where their
extremely elongated toes allow them to distribute their weight so that they can
walk on floating leaves while they hunt for food. This has given the bird the
local name of water chestnut bird.</P>
      <P>Because of its success in aiding the recovery of the endangered bird, the park,
developed on a 15-hectare former sugar cane plot, has become a key ecological
conservation spot and a popular tourist attraction.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's manpower demand in the first quarter of next year is expected to fall
by 5,600, mainly due to contracting businesses,  according to the results of a
survey published Tuesday by the Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA).</P>
      <P>According to the CLA survey, companies are expected to hire a combined total of
21,000 workers in the first quarter of 2009, while more than 26,000 will be laid
off, representing a reduction of about 5,600 workers. It will be the second
consecutive quarterly fall following a decrease of about 26,000 in the fourth
quarter of this year, CLA officials said.</P>
      <P>The CLA ascribed the continued decline to lower market demand at home and abroad
as a result of shrinking business due to the global financial turmoil and
plummeting stock markets around the world.</P>
      <P>Around 59 percent of the companies planning job cuts in the first three months
of next year said they had decided to do so because of "contracting business, "
while 44.2 percent said they would be "streamlining the workforce," the survey
results show.</P>
      <P>The real estate, leasing, insurance, construction, manufacturing and retail
sectors will see the most noticeable drops in business activity in the coming
three-month period, while sports, leisure, scientific and technology service
businesses will undergo the largest workforce cuts, the survey has found.</P>
      <P>The highest number of layoffs -- some 11,000 -- will come in the manufacturing
sector, followed by some 1,400 in the construction sector, according to the
survey results.</P>
      <P>Very few businesses are set to expand their workforces in the coming quarter,
with the retail sector planning to hire 3,200 new workers, the largest number of
all the sectors surveyed.</P>

a visit to Taiwan in early November, and said this might allow Chinese people to
better understand Taiwanese people, as "maybe a movie transmits a more subtle
message than words can express."</P>
      <P>Ledoux also expressed hope that through the festival, now in its fourth year,
more Taiwanese students will be convinced to visit Europe as tourists or
students and discover by themselves the region's various aspects.</P>
      <P>The 10 films, from 10 member states of the European Union, will be presented in
DVD format in their original versions with Chinese and English subtitles  at 14
universities  and three cultural institutions around the country, including the
Youth Hub in Taipei, the Image Museum in Hsinchu City and the Kaohsiung Film
Archive in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The festival, initiated in 2005 with the aim of promoting European art and
culture, is organized by the EETO and the Infine Art and Culture Exchange, with
support from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday that Taiwan aims to be a peacemaker instead
of a troublemaker in the international community.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks in a meeting with Francisco Brottes, chairman of the France-
Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Group, and Rudy Salles, vice president  of the
National  Assembly of France,  at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Ma said that since his inauguration in late May, the Taiwan government has been
trying to create stable international relations by opting for a "very
scrupulous" diplomatic policy and working to improve Taiwan-China relations.</P>
      <P>Ma referred to his "flexible diplomacy" or "modus vivendi" approach, which he
said is a pragmatic strategy to gain more international space for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The aim is to consolidate diplomatic relations with Taiwan's allies and restore
mutual trust with other countries without being at loggerheads with China, he
said.</P>
      <P>Ma said that he welcomed the French friendship group's visit, noting that for
many years it has contributed significantly to the development of bilateral
relations between Taiwan and France.</P>
      <P>The current visit by the group will help to build on what has already been
achieved, Ma added.</P>
      <P>The president said that Taiwan has had cordial exchanges with France in many
areas and would like to learn from France's nuclear waste disposal expertise.
France is a world leader in the area of nuclear technology, with nuclear power
accounting for 78 percent of its energy supply.</P>
      <P>Ma said that both Taiwan and France will benefit as a result of Taiwan's efforts
to improve its international relations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's relations with Europe will also benefit as result of the improvement in
Taiwan-China relations and French President Nicolas Sarkozy's assumption of the
European Union rotating chairmanship in July, Ma said.</P>
      <P>The president also expressed appreciation for the EU's support for Taiwan's
efforts this year to participate in the United Nations specialized agencies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Antofine could be potent anticancer prodrug: Taiwanese scientist</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A study by a Taiwanese professor has led to the finding that antofine -- a
phenanthroindolizidine alkaloid compound -- can effectively eliminate human
cancer cells and could serve as a new anti-cancer prodrug.</P>
      <P>Wu Tian-shung, who teaches at the Department of Chemistry of National Cheng Kung
University in the southern city of Tainan, disclosed Tuesday that in addition to
antofine, his research has found that deoxypergularinine -- another compound
belonging to the phenanthroindolizidine type alkaloid group -- also shows strong
anti-cancer activity.</P>
      <P>Wu has been studying Chinese herbal medicine for more than 30 years. Because his
previous studies with several professors at the University of North Carolina
showed that the pure compound antofine, which is extracted from two plants --
Cryptocarya chinensis and Ficus septica -- has significant potency against
various human tumor cell lines, he and his team at NCKU decided to study it
further.</P>
      <P>The results of his previous research were published in the June 1 issue of Bio-
organic and Medicinal Chemistry, a fortnightly journal published in the United
States.</P>
      <P>During the process of his more recent work, his team used an organic chemistry
method to synthesize antofine, deoxypergularinine and their dehydro congeners.</P>
      <P>All the synthetic compounds and intermediates were screened against lung, breast
and nasopharyngeal cancer cell lines and the multidrug-resistant cancer cell
subline known as KB-VIN.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the results show that antofine had the best effect against all
four cancer cell lines, while deoxypergularine also performed well, although it
was less potent than antofine. The dehydro congeners showed reduced potency
against all cell lines.</P>
      <P>The laboratory research reconfirms that antofine has significant potency against
various human tumor cell lines,  offering the potential for a new anticancer
medicine, Wu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Exhibition on Silk Road artifacts from Xinjiang to kick off in Taipei</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 150 priceless artifacts from the Silk Road era,  including a remarkably
well-preserved  female mummy unearthed in Xinjiang in northwestern China, will
be exhibited at Taiwan's National Museum of History in Taipei from Dec. 6, the
organizers announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference, museum director Huang Yung-chuan said the
exhibition will feature pre-Qin Dynasty metal vessels, textiles from Han and Jin
dynasties, Wei and Jin Dynasty wall paintings and Tang Dynasty silk paintings
discovered in China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, part of what was
formerly known as the Western Territories and a vital hub on the Silk Road.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the region's dry climate and geographic situation, Huang said, the
color and luster of the ancient artifacts are "so well-preserved that they look
as though they were just painted yesterday."</P>
      <P>The organizer made particular mention of one highlight called the "Loulan
Beauty, " a female caucasian mummy dating back around 3,800 years that still has
hair, skin and organs that remain undecayed and which created  shockwaves  in
archaeological  circles upon its discovery.</P>
      <P>The exhibits, which will be divided into five categories based on their cultural
features, reflect the grandeur of the desert frontier of the Western Territories
and have incalculable academic value for those studying  trade,  transport,
ancient  civilizations  and Chinese-Western interchanges during previous eras,
according to Huang.</P>
      <P>Anwar Khasim, an official from the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region Museum,
said that other features of the exhibition include China's only wooden guardian
warrior stamping on a demon, an artifact that was used to protect the spirit of
the deceased, as well as a wool robe for a male mummy with Persian-style
embroidery and ancient Greek design.</P>
      <P>The exhibition will continue until mid-March next year, according to museum
officials.</P>
      <P>The Silk Road was a trade route that extended for over 7,000 km, over 1,700 km
of which was inside China, which connects Asia and the Mediterranean region. It
starts in the east in the Chinese city of Changan and ends in the west in what
is now the Turkish city of Instanbul, formerly known as Constantinople, which
was at one time the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire.</P>

      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Tuesday the agenda for the third meeting
between the top negotiators on both sides of the Taiwan Strait will be finalized
by the end of this month or early January at the latest.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Fu Dong-cheng made the remarks in an informal meeting with the
media.</P>
      <P>Fu noted that during the second round of talks between Chiang Pin-kung, chairman
of the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation, and Chen Yunlin, president of
the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, both
sides proposed an agenda for the next round of negotiations.</P>
      <P>As there are still some differences to be worked out, Fu said, it can be
"reasonably concluded" that the agenda for the next round of talks will be ready
by late December or early January, Fu said.</P>
      <P>But he disclosed that a memorandum of understanding on financial cooperation is
one issue that is sure to be on the agenda as both sides feel this should be
addressed as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The agenda proposed by the SEF included cross-strait cooperation in the areas of
combating crime, strengthening food safety, the inspection and quarantine of
agriculture produce, and on financial, investment, fishery and cultural and
educational cooperation.</P>
      <P>The SEF also proposed increasing dialogues between the SEF and the ARATS.</P>
      <P>For its part, the ARATS proposed that the agenda include joint efforts to combat
crime, inspection and quarantine of plants and animals, financial and industrial
cooperation, investment and intellectual property protection, fishery
cooperation and reciprocal stationing of news reporters.</P>
      <P>Chiang and Chen held landmark talks in Beijing in June this year, reaching
agreements on wider opening by Taiwan to Chinese tourists and direct weekend
charter flights between the two sides.</P>
      <P>In the second round of talks, the two sides signed accords on direct shipping,

      <P>Five elementary schools in remote parts of the country that have been recipients
of a Web-based literacy program donated by IBM have made improvements rated at
over 60 percent in terms of their students' English learning, an IBM executive
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to Tung Chih-hsiang, IBM-Taiwan's general manager, students at the
schools have made progress in English pronunciation and vocabulary ability by
using a program called Reading Companion. Their interest in learning the
language has also increased as a result of the program.</P>
      <P>The five elementary schools, which received the software and related equipment
in September, are Jhuwei in Taipei County, Kelin in Yilan County, Jinjhu in
Kaohsiung County, Chiangyuan in Pingtung County and Chulai in Taitung County.</P>
      <P>The program applies advanced voice identification technology to "listen" to
users speaking English and provides feedback, allowing users to adjust and
correct their pronunciation, Tung said, adding that students can also borrow
equipment from their schools to practice at home.</P>
      <P>He made special mention of Jhuwei Elementary School, which is making an
electronic illustrated book using the program's Book Builder feature to
introduce four foods associated with Taipei County's Tamsui township -- fish
balls, plum juice, fried tofu and iron egg.</P>
      <P>Teachers will read and record the book and upload the recordings to the
program's online global library so that users all over the world will be able to
learn something about Tamsui, Tung said.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Reading Companion program is one of IBM's plans for education
reforms, in which the company has invested US$75 million. The literacy program
started in 2006 and has been utilized by over 450 schools and non-profit
organizations around the globe.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung city government is hoping for debt forgiveness in respect of
NT$38.1 billion in labor insurance fees and health insurance premiums that it
owes to the central government, a senior city government official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lei Chung-da, director of the Finance Bureau of the Kaohsiung city government,
said that since 1993, the central government has seized 39 tracts of land owned
by the city government because the city government could not afford to pay its
share of the labor insurance fees and the health insurance premiums.</P>
      <P>According to the Labor Insurance Act and the National Health Insurance Act, the
city government, as a special municipality under the control of the Cabinet, has
an obligation to shoulder 5 percent of the labor insurance fees and health
insurance premiums for certain employees, including employees of publicly and
privately owned enterprises or institutions.</P>
      <P>Lei said the seizure of the 39 tracts of land -- worth billions of New Taiwan
Dollars -- by the central government has hampered many of the city's development
projects.</P>
      <P>He urged the central government to amend the existing relevant laws to forgive
the city's debts and alleviate the local government's financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>Lei welcomed a decision made by Premier Liu Chao-shiuan a few days ago that the
Cabinet will delink Kaohsiung's debts to the central government from seizure of
Kaohsiung's land.</P>
      <P>He said Kaohsiung's debt to the central government is growing by NT$5.6 billion
annually, and that although the city government has set aside NT$3.6 billion
every year to pay back the central government, it will never be able to settle
the debt.</P>

    <HEADLINE>City government begins site selection for damaged gondola tower</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei city government has begun the process of selecting a site for the
possible relocation of a damaged support tower on the Maokong Gondola system,
Mayor Hau Lung-bin said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"We have started a feasibility study and evaluation of possible sites for
relocation of damaged support tower T-16 in accordance with recommendations by
local civil engineering experts, " Hau told a news conference held after a city
government policy review meeting.</P>
      <P>The cable car system,  a popular tourist attraction in a mountainous area of
Taipei's suburban Wenshan district, was closed indefinitely Oct. 1 out of
concern that Tower No. 16 could collapse during an earthquake after torrential
rain brought by Typhoon Jangmei in September eroded the base of the tower,
leaving it bare and exposed.</P>
      <P>An initial  safety  assessment  filed by four major civil engineering
associations Sunday strongly recommended that the tower be relocated and that
the entire slope in the vicinity of the pillar be reinforced to make the Maokong
Gondola safe.</P>
      <P>According to a preliminary estimate by city officials, relocating the tower will
cost at least NT$200 million (US$6 million) and will take two years, while
simply reinforcing the existing tower in its original location will take only
six months.</P>
      <P>As relocation would involve a raft of professional technical details, including
comprehensive geological and topographic data, Hau said a final decision on
whether the damaged support pillar should be relocated or reinforced will not be
made until after the city government has received a final assessment from the
four civil engineering groups, which is expected to be submitted by Dec. 12.</P>
      <P>Hau said he has directed relevant city staff to begin a relocation feasibility
study and evaluation of various possible sites based on the civil engineering
groups' recommendations.</P>
      <P>As to whether anyone should to be called to account for giving the go-ahead for
construction of the gondola system on an area of weak bedrock, Hau said the
issue will be addressed after the civil engineering groups provide their final
assessment.</P>
      <P>"If any civil servants are found to be liable for the original site selection
and any subsequent construction flaws, the city government will transfer all
relevant information to the watchdog Control Yuan, which will carry out the
investigation," Hau added.</P>
      <P>Residents in the neighborhood have vowed to launch strong protests if the
damaged tower is not moved.</P>
      <P>City councilors from the opposition Democratic  Progressive Party have
criticized Hau's predecessor Ma Ying-jeou, who is now president, for what they
describe as mishandling of the gondola construction project.</P>
      <P>In response, Hau contended that as a mayor cannot decide the location of the
support towers, "former Mayor Ma Ying-jeou bears no political responsibility."</P>

      <P>The 2009 New Year holiday will last four days from Jan. 1-4, Central Personnel
Administration Minister Chen Ching-hsiou announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The announcement ended debate on whether to adjust the length of the New Year
holiday -- normally a single day -- after the legislative caucus of the ruling
Kuomintang proposed prolonging the first holiday of 2009 to include Jan. 2,
because Jan. 1 falls on a Thursday, a move that would give people the two days
plus the following two-day weekend.</P>
      <P>The caucus said expanding the holiday will help boost domestic consumption,
while the additional Friday -- which would be a work day under normal
circumstances -- can be made up by taking away a Saturday later in the year.</P>
      <P>The proposal, however, drew opposition from Tsai Lien-sheng, secretary-general
of the Taipei-based Chinese National Federation of Industries, who said the
proposal might have an adverse effect on the country's manufacturing enterprises

      <P>The Pheasant-tailed Jacana Park in Guantien township in Tainan County, southern
Taiwan has succeeded in boosting the population of the endangered species while
developing as a safe nesting  place  for both migratory  and indigenous
waterfowl, conservationists said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The conservationists of the Taipei-based Chinese Wild Bird Federation said the
population of the pheasant-tailed jacana -- selected as the Tainan County bird
-- has increased to nearly 300 in the Guantien area alone, from fewer than 50
all over Taiwan just 10 years ago.</P>
      <P>The federation attributed the achievement to recovery efforts by the county
government-run park, which was built in 1998 with a subsidy from the Taiwan High
Speed Rail Corp. in response to local activists' calls for protection of the
indigenous water bird.</P>
      <P>Construction of the railway had destroyed an area of wetland where the birds
formerly lived.</P>
      <P>The pheasant-tailed jacana, or hydrophasia nus chirurgus, is a beautiful bird
that breeds in ponds or wetland areas and sports a long pheasant-like tail while
in its breeding plumage, hence its common name.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, jacana usually congregate in water chestnut fields, where their
extremely elongated toes allow them to distribute their weight so that they can
walk on floating leaves while they hunt for food. This has given the bird the
local name of water chestnut bird.</P>
      <P>Because of its success in aiding the recovery of the endangered bird, the park,
developed on a 15-hectare former sugar cane plot, has become a key ecological
conservation spot and a popular tourist attraction.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's manpower demand in the first quarter of next year is expected to fall
by 5,600, mainly due to contracting businesses,  according to the results of a
survey published Tuesday by the Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA).</P>
      <P>According to the CLA survey, companies are expected to hire a combined total of
21,000 workers in the first quarter of 2009, while more than 26,000 will be laid
off, representing a reduction of about 5,600 workers. It will be the second
consecutive quarterly fall following a decrease of about 26,000 in the fourth
quarter of this year, CLA officials said.</P>
      <P>The CLA ascribed the continued decline to lower market demand at home and abroad
as a result of shrinking business due to the global financial turmoil and
plummeting stock markets around the world.</P>
      <P>Around 59 percent of the companies planning job cuts in the first three months
of next year said they had decided to do so because of "contracting business, "
while 44.2 percent said they would be "streamlining the workforce," the survey
results show.</P>
      <P>The real estate, leasing, insurance, construction, manufacturing and retail
sectors will see the most noticeable drops in business activity in the coming
three-month period, while sports, leisure, scientific and technology service
businesses will undergo the largest workforce cuts, the survey has found.</P>
      <P>The highest number of layoffs -- some 11,000 -- will come in the manufacturing
sector, followed by some 1,400 in the construction sector, according to the
survey results.</P>
      <P>Very few businesses are set to expand their workforces in the coming quarter,
with the retail sector planning to hire 3,200 new workers, the largest number of
all the sectors surveyed.</P>

      <P>The fourth Taiwan European Film Festival kicked off Tuesday in Taipei, with the
organizers announcing that 10 European  films will be shown in free screenings
at various universities around the country throughout December to promote
European cultures and help local people find out more about Europe.</P>
      <P>At the opening ceremony and premiere -- a screening of the Italian film "The
Fever" held at Chinese Culture University, Guy Ledoux, director of the European
Economic and Trade Office (EETO) , said the film festival is expected to help
Taiwanese audiences gain a better understanding of European cultures.</P>
      <P>"Watching movies is one of the best ways to understand the lives and histories
of people in another part of the world," he said.</P>
      <P>He noted that recently, a delegation of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits saw the Taiwanese movie "Cape No. 7" during
a visit to Taiwan in early November, and said this might allow Chinese people to
better understand Taiwanese people, as "maybe a movie transmits a more subtle
message than words can express."</P>
      <P>Ledoux also expressed hope that through the festival, now in its fourth year,
more Taiwanese students will be convinced to visit Europe as tourists or
students and discover by themselves the region's various aspects.</P>
      <P>The 10 films, from 10 member states of the European Union, will be presented in
DVD format in their original versions with Chinese and English subtitles  at 14
universities  and three cultural institutions around the country, including the
Youth Hub in Taipei, the Image Museum in Hsinchu City and the Kaohsiung Film

    <HEADLINE>Antofine could be potent anticancer prodrug: Taiwanese scientist</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A study by a Taiwanese professor has led to the finding that antofine -- a
phenanthroindolizidine alkaloid compound -- can effectively eliminate human
cancer cells and could serve as a new anti-cancer prodrug.</P>
      <P>Wu Tian-shung, who teaches at the Department of Chemistry of National Cheng Kung
University in the southern city of Tainan, disclosed Tuesday that in addition to
antofine, his research has found that deoxypergularinine -- another compound
belonging to the phenanthroindolizidine type alkaloid group -- also shows strong
anti-cancer activity.</P>
      <P>Wu has been studying Chinese herbal medicine for more than 30 years. Because his
previous studies with several professors at the University of North Carolina
showed that the pure compound antofine, which is extracted from two plants --
Cryptocarya chinensis and Ficus septica -- has significant potency against
various human tumor cell lines, he and his team at NCKU decided to study it
further.</P>
      <P>The results of his previous research were published in the June 1 issue of Bio-
organic and Medicinal Chemistry, a fortnightly journal published in the United
States.</P>
      <P>During the process of his more recent work, his team used an organic chemistry
method to synthesize antofine, deoxypergularinine and their dehydro congeners.</P>
      <P>All the synthetic compounds and intermediates were screened against lung, breast
and nasopharyngeal cancer cell lines and the multidrug-resistant cancer cell
subline known as KB-VIN.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the results show that antofine had the best effect against all
four cancer cell lines, while deoxypergularine also performed well, although it
was less potent than antofine. The dehydro congeners showed reduced potency
against all cell lines.</P>
      <P>The laboratory research reconfirms that antofine has significant potency against
various human tumor cell lines,  offering the potential for a new anticancer
medicine, Wu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Exhibition on Silk Road artifacts from Xinjiang to kick off in Taipei</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 150 priceless artifacts from the Silk Road era,  including a remarkably
well-preserved  female mummy unearthed in Xinjiang in northwestern China, will
be exhibited at Taiwan's National Museum of History in Taipei from Dec. 6, the
organizers announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference, museum director Huang Yung-chuan said the
exhibition will feature pre-Qin Dynasty metal vessels, textiles from Han and Jin
dynasties, Wei and Jin Dynasty wall paintings and Tang Dynasty silk paintings
discovered in China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, part of what was
formerly known as the Western Territories and a vital hub on the Silk Road.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the region's dry climate and geographic situation, Huang said, the
color and luster of the ancient artifacts are "so well-preserved that they look
as though they were just painted yesterday."</P>
      <P>The organizer made particular mention of one highlight called the "Loulan
Beauty, " a female caucasian mummy dating back around 3,800 years that still has
hair, skin and organs that remain undecayed and which created  shockwaves  in
archaeological  circles upon its discovery.</P>
      <P>The exhibits, which will be divided into five categories based on their cultural
features, reflect the grandeur of the desert frontier of the Western Territories
and have incalculable academic value for those studying  trade,  transport,
ancient  civilizations  and Chinese-Western interchanges during previous eras,
according to Huang.</P>
      <P>Anwar Khasim, an official from the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region Museum,
said that other features of the exhibition include China's only wooden guardian
warrior stamping on a demon, an artifact that was used to protect the spirit of
the deceased, as well as a wool robe for a male mummy with Persian-style
embroidery and ancient Greek design.</P>
      <P>The exhibition will continue until mid-March next year, according to museum
officials.</P>
      <P>The Silk Road was a trade route that extended for over 7,000 km, over 1,700 km
of which was inside China, which connects Asia and the Mediterranean region. It
starts in the east in the Chinese city of Changan and ends in the west in what
is now the Turkish city of Instanbul, formerly known as Constantinople, which
was at one time the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire.</P>

      <P>Five elementary schools in remote parts of the country that have been recipients
of a Web-based literacy program donated by IBM have made improvements rated at
over 60 percent in terms of their students' English learning, an IBM executive
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to Tung Chih-hsiang, IBM-Taiwan's general manager, students at the
schools have made progress in English pronunciation and vocabulary ability by
using a program called Reading Companion. Their interest in learning the
language has also increased as a result of the program.</P>
      <P>The five elementary schools, which received the software and related equipment
in September, are Jhuwei in Taipei County, Kelin in Yilan County, Jinjhu in
Kaohsiung County, Chiangyuan in Pingtung County and Chulai in Taitung County.</P>
      <P>The program applies advanced voice identification technology to "listen" to
users speaking English and provides feedback, allowing users to adjust and
correct their pronunciation, Tung said, adding that students can also borrow
equipment from their schools to practice at home.</P>
      <P>He made special mention of Jhuwei Elementary School, which is making an
electronic illustrated book using the program's Book Builder feature to
introduce four foods associated with Taipei County's Tamsui township -- fish
balls, plum juice, fried tofu and iron egg.</P>
      <P>Teachers will read and record the book and upload the recordings to the
program's online global library so that users all over the world will be able to
learn something about Tamsui, Tung said.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Reading Companion program is one of IBM's plans for education
reforms, in which the company has invested US$75 million. The literacy program
started in 2006 and has been utilized by over 450 schools and non-profit

      <P>The Kaohsiung city government is hoping for debt forgiveness in respect of
NT$38.1 billion in labor insurance fees and health insurance premiums that it
owes to the central government, a senior city government official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lei Chung-da, director of the Finance Bureau of the Kaohsiung city government,
said that since 1993, the central government has seized 39 tracts of land owned
by the city government because the city government could not afford to pay its
share of the labor insurance fees and the health insurance premiums.</P>
      <P>According to the Labor Insurance Act and the National Health Insurance Act, the
city government, as a special municipality under the control of the Cabinet, has
an obligation to shoulder 5 percent of the labor insurance fees and health
insurance premiums for certain employees, including employees of publicly and
privately owned enterprises or institutions.</P>
      <P>Lei said the seizure of the 39 tracts of land -- worth billions of New Taiwan
Dollars -- by the central government has hampered many of the city's development
projects.</P>
      <P>He urged the central government to amend the existing relevant laws to forgive
the city's debts and alleviate the local government's financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>Lei welcomed a decision made by Premier Liu Chao-shiuan a few days ago that the
Cabinet will delink Kaohsiung's debts to the central government from seizure of
Kaohsiung's land.</P>
      <P>He said Kaohsiung's debt to the central government is growing by NT$5.6 billion
annually, and that although the city government has set aside NT$3.6 billion
every year to pay back the central government, it will never be able to settle
the debt.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei city government has begun the process of selecting a site for the
possible relocation of a damaged support tower on the Maokong Gondola system,
Mayor Hau Lung-bin said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"We have started a feasibility study and evaluation of possible sites for
relocation of damaged support tower T-16 in accordance with recommendations by
local civil engineering experts, " Hau told a news conference held after a city
government policy review meeting.</P>
      <P>The cable car system,  a popular tourist attraction in a mountainous area of
Taipei's suburban Wenshan district, was closed indefinitely Oct. 1 out of
concern that Tower No. 16 could collapse during an earthquake after torrential
rain brought by Typhoon Jangmei in September eroded the base of the tower,
leaving it bare and exposed.</P>
      <P>An initial  safety  assessment  filed by four major civil engineering
associations Sunday strongly recommended that the tower be relocated and that
the entire slope in the vicinity of the pillar be reinforced to make the Maokong
Gondola safe.</P>
      <P>According to a preliminary estimate by city officials, relocating the tower will
cost at least NT$200 million (US$6 million) and will take two years, while
simply reinforcing the existing tower in its original location will take only
six months.</P>
      <P>As relocation would involve a raft of professional technical details, including
comprehensive geological and topographic data, Hau said a final decision on
whether the damaged support pillar should be relocated or reinforced will not be
made until after the city government has received a final assessment from the
four civil engineering groups, which is expected to be submitted by Dec. 12.</P>
      <P>Hau said he has directed relevant city staff to begin a relocation feasibility
study and evaluation of various possible sites based on the civil engineering
groups' recommendations.</P>
      <P>As to whether anyone should to be called to account for giving the go-ahead for
construction of the gondola system on an area of weak bedrock, Hau said the
issue will be addressed after the civil engineering groups provide their final
assessment.</P>
      <P>"If any civil servants are found to be liable for the original site selection
and any subsequent construction flaws, the city government will transfer all
relevant information to the watchdog Control Yuan, which will carry out the
investigation," Hau added.</P>
      <P>Residents in the neighborhood have vowed to launch strong protests if the
damaged tower is not moved.</P>
      <P>City councilors from the opposition Democratic  Progressive Party have
criticized Hau's predecessor Ma Ying-jeou, who is now president, for what they
describe as mishandling of the gondola construction project.</P>
      <P>In response, Hau contended that as a mayor cannot decide the location of the
support towers, "former Mayor Ma Ying-jeou bears no political responsibility."</P>

    <HEADLINE>No information from China on WHA bid talks: presidential spokesman</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.3  (CNA)
12/03/08  13:34:29
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has not received any information about talks with China on
Taiwan's bid to take part in the annual World Health Assembly (WHA) meeting,
Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said late Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wang was responding to reports that Beijing is open to dealing with issues
regarding Taiwan's participation in the WHA -- the decision-making arm of the
World Health Organization (WHO) -- in line with a joint communique issued after
a meeting in Beijing in 2005 between then-Kuomintang  (KMT)  Chairman Lien Chan
and Chinese President Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>The reports quoted an unidentified KMT official as saying that when Hu met with
Lien on the sidelines of the annual Asia Pacific Economic Forum (APEC) leaders'
summit in Peru, he expressed the hope that President Ma Ying-jeou would send
delegates to Beijing to discuss the WHA issue.</P>
      <P>Lien, now the KMT's honorary chairman, served as Ma's envoy at the Nov. 22-23
APEC summit held in the Peruvian capital of Lima.</P>
      <P>Wang said the government has been working toward its goal of securing
participation in the 2009 WHA to be held next May in Geneva.</P>
      <P>"We have been striving hard for this target and will never stop our efforts
until realizing the goal, " he said.</P>
      <P>As to how Taiwan will participate in the annual WHA activities, Wang  said the
government  has not yet received  any further information.</P>
      <P>Because of Beijing's sovereignty claim, Taiwan has been barred from taking part
in international organizations or activities that require  statehood,  including
the  United  Nations  and  the U.N.-affiliated WHO and its governing body, the
WHA.</P>
      <P>In the 2005 Lien-Hu joint communique, the two men pledged to galvanize the two
sides to address the aspiration of Taiwan's people to be represented in major
international activities, particularly Taiwan's participation in WHO activities.</P>
      <P>At the time, the KMT was in opposition and Hu signed the communique in his
capacity as general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC).</P>
      <P>The two parties promised to work together to create favorable conditions for an
ultimate solution to the thorny issue regarding Taiwan's participation in world
organizations.</P>
      <P>Lien's office would not comment on the latest reports about Hu's hope of
President Ma sending delegates to China for talks on WHA issues.</P>
      <P>Although the KMT returned to power in May this year, senior party officials, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said there is little chance that Taiwan's WHA
participation issue will be addressed through the KMT-CPC dialogue platform.</P>
      <P>In their view, they added, the issue should instead be handled by the  Cabinet-
level  Mainland  Affairs  Council  and  Taiwan's quasi-official intermediary
body -- the Straits Exchange Foundation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Deputy Secretary-General Chang Jung-kung, who concurrently heads
the KMT's Mainland Affairs Department, said he had not heard Lien mention
China's hope that Ma send envoys to China for talks on the WHA issue.</P>
      <P>As to a regular KMT-CPC forum scheduled to take place later this month, Chang
said the meeting's agenda will focus on economic and trade topics and will not
address the WHA bid.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Murderer in love rivalry case released on parole</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  3 (CNA)
12/03/08  14:25:30
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A former graduate student of National Tsinghua University who murdered her love
rival and mutilated her body in 1998 was released on parole Wednesday after
serving over two-thirds, or nearly 11 years, of her sentence for the crime.</P>
      <P>Hung Hsiao-huei was given her freedom from the Kaohsiung Women's Prison in
Kaohsiung City, southern Taiwan, after the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) granted her
parole Nov. 11.</P>
      <P>The MOJ cited a number of factors in its decision, including that Hung had
served over two-thirds of her sentence of 16 years and three months without
misbehaving and had been awarded merits on nine occasions for good behavior as
an inmate.</P>
      <P>It also said the prison promised that Hung would have full family support and
have no problem looking for work upon her release.</P>
      <P>Meeting the press at the gate of the prison, Hung once again apologized to the
parents of her victim, graduate school classmate Hsu Chia-chen, and expressed
her willingness to do whatever she could to compensate them for their loss.</P>
      <P>Hung apologized for the shock and disturbance she had caused the country and
offered her appreciation to Taiwan's society for "giving her an opportunity to
restart her life as a new person."</P>
      <P>Accompanied by volunteers from the nonprofit social service group Taiwan After-
care Association, Hung then reported to the Kaohsiung District Prosecutors
Office, where she met probation officers on matters regarding her release and
how she should behave after being freed.</P>
      <P>Hung will be on parole for the remaining five years of her sentence, during
which she will be required by law to report to probation officers once a month.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung Women's Prison had previously applied for parole on Hung's behalf
four times, but was rejected three times by a Kaohsiung prison parole review
board and once by the MOJ.</P>
      <P>MOJ officials said those rejections came after taking into consideration such
factors as social justice, the perceptions of the general public and the
feelings of the family of the victim.</P>
      <P>Hung was found guilty of killing and mutilating Hsu in an auditorium at National
Tsinghua University in Hsinchu City, northern Taiwan, in March 1998.</P>
      <P>At the time, Hung and Hsu were second-year graduate students at the prestigious
university's radiobiology institute vying for the affection of the same man.</P>
      <P>During an argument, Hung knocked Hsu unconscious and poured aqua regia -- a
potent corrosive chemical -- over Hsu's nose and mouth, killing her classmate.
Hung then dragged the body to the rear of the auditorium in the hope that it
would remain undetected.</P>
      <P>Hung was eventually sentenced to 18 years in a jail, which was reduced last year
to 16 years and three months, and ordered by the court to pay Hsu's parents
NT$24 million (US$718,563) in compensation.</P>
      <P>Hung served part of her sentence at the Taipei Prison and the Taoyuan Prison
from January 1999 through March 2001. She was transferred to Kaohsiung Women's
Prison on March 21, 2001, and has been held there ever since.</P>
      <P>Known as the prison's best-educated inmate, Hung taught other inmates English
and various other subjects, prison sources said, adding that she looked forward
to continuing her graduate studies after her release.</P>
      <P>They also said Hung hopes society will forgive her and will allow her to get
back on her feet and save enough money to meet her obligations to Hsu's parents.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan expects sound ties with U.S. under Obama administration</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  Dec.  2 (CNA)
12/03/08  14:25:36

    <TEXT>
      <P>Relations between Taiwan and the United States should remain sound under the new
administration of U.S. President-elect Barack Obama as Taipei continues to try
to rebuild mutual trust between the two sides, a high-ranking Taiwan official
said in London Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Expressing optimism over the future development of Taiwan-U.S. relations, Deputy
Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrew Li-yan Hsia said he believes "it will not be
too difficult" to restore the frienship that was broken by the former Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) administration,  citing improving relations  between
Taipei and Washington since President Ma Ying-jeou was inaugurated six months
ago.</P>
      <P>In his keynote speech at the Royal United Services Institue for Defence and
Securities in London, Hsia contrasted the approaches of Ma's administration and
the previous DPP government.</P>
      <P>During the eight-year DPP administration, he argued, Taiwan followed  a
diplomatic  policy  that emphasized  the country's sovereignty  and highlighted
its presence in the international community using extreme methods, without
regard for the economic and military prowess of China.</P>
      <P>Such an approach was unsuccessful in achieving Taiwan's goal for membership in
the United Nations and World Health Organization, and instead cost the country
the support of international friends, Hsia contended.</P>
      <P>The number of Taiwan's diplomatic allies fell from 29 to 23 during  those  eight
years,  and the country  was labeled  a "troublemaker," he said.</P>
      <P>Since his May 20 inauguration, President Ma has been working to improve Taiwan's
ties with China and engage in foreign relations using a pragmatic approach, Hsia
said.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan-China dialogue resuming in June and a second round of talks
following in November, the two sides have signed several agreements to pave the
way for direct cross-Taiwan Strait transport and postal links and improved food
safety, he said.</P>
      <P>Hsia told his audience that Ma's foreign policy is aimed at turning Taiwan into
a "peacemaker" and preventing Taiwan and China from wasting resources on
unnecessary diplomatic competition.</P>
      <P>Under  such  a policy,  Ma  advocates  expanding  Taiwan's international
participation while maintaining the status quo in which Taiwan has 23 diplomatic
allies and China has 171, he said.</P>
      <P>Stressing that it is very important for Taiwan to enjoy a reasonable presence in
the international community, Hsia warned that if Beijing continues to suppress
Taiwan's bids to participate in international organizations, it will fuel anti-
China sentiment among Taiwan's people.</P>

12/03/08  16:28:37

    <TEXT>
      <P>Brookings Institution President Strobe Talbott said Wednesday that the next
United States administration will support the concept of giving Taiwan more
international space and insisted that there would be continuity in Washington's
Taiwan Strait policy.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar held to discuss the impact of a new U.S. administration on
relations between Taiwan and China, Talbott argued that Taiwan should be allowed
to participate in the international community because the world of today is much
more complicated than in the past and countries are more interdependent.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan  is part of the international  community  and has contributed to the
international community, " said Talbott, citing Taiwan's  presence  in the World
Trade  Organization  and its contributions in medicine and public health."</P>
      <P>The next U.S. admininstration will therefore support "the concept of giving more
international space to Taiwan, " said Talbott, who served as deputy secretary of
state from 1994 to 2001 during the Clinton administration and has been mentioned
as a possible appointee in the new government.</P>
      <P>Richard Bush, director of the Brookings Center for Northeast Asian Policy
Studies (CNAPS) and former chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan,
questioned, however, whether the United States might not pay less attention to
Taiwan in view of its severe economic challenges.</P>
      <P>He said people in Taiwan are concerned about how the new administration and
policies of U.S. President-elect Barack Obama would affect other countries,
"including the cross-strait development between Taiwan and mainland China."</P>
      <P>Talbott responded that relations would remain unchanged, as they had since the
U.S. formally broke ties with Taiwan to recognize China in 1979.</P>
      <P>"Since 1979, we have had five United States presidents, three Republicans and
two Democrats. Sometimes the conservative ones replaced the liberal president,
or vice versa. But the U.S.-Taiwan relationship remains fundamentally the same,"
Talbott said.</P>
      <P>Talbott said Washington's Taiwan Strait policy would continue to be based on the
"one-China" policy, the three communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>"The United States' commitment to peace, stability, and a non-confrontation
approach in cross-strait matters has no changes whatsoever, " Talbott said. "I
would say that President-elect Obama will continue the previous U.S. policy in
the Asia region. You can count on it."</P>
      <P>The new president-elect, however,  will change the overall American approach to
foreign policy based on the ideas of a "common humanity" and "common security"
articulated in his campaign, Talbott said.</P>
      <P>"Obama is assuming himself as the diplomatic chief. He thinks of the U.S.
president  as a community  organizer,  helping  the international community to
organize things to meet global problems and to come up with global solutions,"
Talbott said.</P>
      <P>That will mean a return to the principles of pragmatism and multilateralism
following the failure of unilaterism, Talbott said.</P>
      <P>"The U.S. needs to refurbish its image. And to do that we need help from our
allies. We also need their help to address the daunting challenge of the
economic crisis that is emerging, " argued Talbott, who said this new focus
should be good news to Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung City government is continuing its push for construction of a cable
car system in the southern port city, as the Maokong Gondola in Taipei's
suburban Muzha area has been plagued by mounting safety concerns, a city
government official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Installing a cross-Kaohsiung harbor cable car system is part of a Kaohsiung City
government project to develop its Cijin island into a popular tourist
destination similar to Sentosa Island in Singapore, according to Wu Yi-lung,
chief of the city's Urban Development Planning Bureau.</P>
      <P>He said the Sentosa-style resort plan was submitted to the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications' Tourism Bureau for review but has not yet
been approved.</P>
      <P>The plan involves opening 100 hectares of land between the Cijin Windmill Park
and the Chihou Fortress for private investment in hotels, cable cars and
amusement park facilities, Wu added.</P>
      <P>Noting that the cost of the development plan is estimated at NT$46 billion
(US$1.37 billion) , Wu said that after the plan is approved by the Tourism
Bureau, the city government will develop the land into aspecial tourism zone to
attract investment from tourism and gambling operators.</P>
      <P>Wu said the city government plans to build two cross-harbor cable car routes --
one connecting Kaohsiung MRT Sizihwan Station and Chihou and the other from
Chihou to the Chungchou Windmill Park in Cijin. The two routes will be built
over a total distance of 3.5 kilometers at a cost of around NT$1.7 billion, he
added.</P>
      <P>He also said that the municipal government is not worried about encountering the
same safety problems as on the Maokong Gondola system because the planned
Kaohsiung cable car system will be built on a non-sensitive geological area. He
added that once the support pillars on the proposed system are stable enough,
there should be no safety problems.</P>
      <P>The Maokong Gondola service has been suspended since October 1 over safety
concerns after mudslides created by Typhoon Jangmei left a2.5m gap beneath one
of its support pillars.</P>
      <P>Although Cijin was selected as the third most popular scenic spot around the
country, it has not attracted enough tourists to generate higher consumption in
the area, according to Wu. He said the government therefore decided to designate
a special tourism zone to help boost the local economy.</P>
      <P>Many enterprises from home and abroad have shown interest in investing in the
construction of hotels and leisure facilities in Cijin once all public
infrastructure is completed, he added.</P>

      <P>Fewer salaried people are daring to switch jobs amid the economic sluggishness,
while those who have recently changed jobs have found they are being paid less
than they earned in their previous jobs, an online job bank said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chiu Wen-jen, a supervisor at the 104 Job Bank, said the number of office
workers who plan to change jobs this year has declined 14 percent compared to
last year, quoting the results of a survey carried out by the company recently.</P>
      <P>About 30 percent of those who succeeded in changing jobs in the most recent
three months found that their starting salaries in their new companies have been
lower by an average of 14.3 percent compared with their previous salaries, Chiu
said.</P>
      <P>He said the bleak business  climate has reduced  people's willingness to change
jobs,  with 30.4 percent of the survey respondents choosing to stick with their
current jobs in order to "save their rice bowls," representing double the figure
recorded last year.</P>
      <P>A high of 76 percent of the respondents said they had become much more timid in
making changes in the face of the domestic economic downturn caused by the
global financial meltdown, according to Chiu.</P>
      <P>Of those who want to change jobs, a great majority mentioned failure of their
current salaries to meet their expectations or reaching their promotion ceiling
as reasons for a change, according to Chiu.</P>
      <P>The poll found that employees in the tourism, mass communications and
manufacturing sectors are keenest to change jobs, as these businesses have been
hardest-hit by the economic downturn and heavy layoffs are most likely to occur
before the end of the year, Chiu noted.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that employees in the financial services and high tech
sectors -- two fields that are traditionally highly coveted -- have become
increasingly restless and more inclined to change jobs, Chiu went on.</P>
      <P>Over 60 percent of the employees surveyed in these two sectors said they want to
change careers, Chiu said, adding that of these, some 30 percent of the
financial services professionals wanted to move to other service industries,
while less then 20 percent wanted to remain in their current employment.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's jobless rate in October hit a five-year monthly high of 4.37 percent,
one of a number of indicators reflecting the country's weakening labor market as
a result of the global economic straits, according to the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics.</P>

      <P>A draft amendment to Taiwan's Conscription Act was passed preliminarily by a
legislative committee Wednesday, shortening the term of conscription from one
year and two months to one year.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee passed
preliminarily the draft amendment to Article 16 of the Conscription Act, calling
for the shortening of the conscription period to one year, beginning January
2009.</P>
      <P>Lu Shiow-yen, a legislator from the ruling Kuomintang, which controls nearly
three-fourths of the legislative seats, said the amendment is adopted in
response to the government's policy of continuously shortening the draft period.</P>
      <P>Since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, Taiwan's government has required
young men over the age of 18 to undergo military training, due to the threat of
possible attacks from its rival China.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense began to shorten the term of conscription in
2004, when the period of mandatory military service was reduced from one year
and 10 months to one year and eight months.</P>
      <P>By January 2007, the term was shortened to one year and four months and as of
July 2007, it was further shortened to one year and two months.</P>
      <P>The shortening of the conscription period is part of the government's efforts to
downsize Taiwan's armed forces, with a target of cutting the number of troops to
fewer than 300,000 by 2009.</P>
      <P>Relations between Taiwan and China have improved this year, following the
election of President Ma Ying-jeou, who has made reducing tensions and improving
ties with China one of his key policies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Carotenoid-rich micro-algae protect, repair liver function: study</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 3 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>A recent study indicates that a micro-alga, dunaliella salina, is capable of
protecting and repairing human livers, as the species contains large amounts of
carotenoids that can neutralize oxidants and free radicals, according to Chung
Shan Medical University (CSMU).</P>
      <P>Researchers at the university in the central city of Taichung said Wednesday
that although carotenoids can be found in many vegetables, the yield of
carotenoid is relatively low. For example, 100 grams of carrot can yield only 12
milligrams of beta-carotene, they said.</P>
      <P>However, 6,000 milligrams of beta-carotene can be obtained from 100 grams of
dunaliella salina -- 500 times higher than the yield from carrots, making it a
far better source of carotenoids, the researchers explained.</P>
      <P>More than 600 kinds of carotenoid have been discovered to date, including alpha-
carotene,  beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein,  and zeaxanthin. Carotenoid, an
organic pigment in essence, can help the human body synthesize vitamins and
prevent oxidation damage.</P>
      <P>Lu Fung-Jou, a professor at CSMU's Institute of Medicine, noted that with their
anti-oxidizing effect, carotenoids can be good anti- aging agents. They can also
help to prevent chronic diseases and age- related macular degeneration (AMD), an
eye disease, he said.</P>
      <P>"Five of them -- alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin
-- are the most effective of all," Lu added.</P>
      <P>Lu said the research team found in its lab experiments that dunaliella salina
not only contains all five of the most effective carotenoids, but also that it
is effective in protecting the health of organs such as the liver.</P>
      <P>In experiments on rodents, the team found that mice whose livers had been
damaged showed signs of improved liver functions after being fed with the algae,
as their levels of glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase  (GOT) ,  glutamate
pyruvate transaminase (GPT) , triglycerides (TG), and cholesterol all dropped
noticeably.</P>
      <P>Researchers said further analysis and testing may discover the full potential of
dunaliella salina and facilitate wider application of the algae.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese bishops to report to the Pope on the state of dioceses</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Archbishop of the Taipei Archdiocese in Taiwan said Wednesday that he will
lead a delegation to the Vatican to present a report for the first time to Pope
Benedict XVI on the state of Taiwan's dioceses, and to invite the Pope to attend
next year's celebrations of the 150th anniversary of the establishment of the
Catholic Church in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We will present an invitation to the Pope, in the hope that he can visit Taiwan
next year," Archbishop John Hung Shan-chuan told the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>As bishops are supposed to meet the Pope every five years, the visit will be the
first time for Taiwanese bishops to report to Benedict XVI, who was elected Pope
in 2005.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese bishops met the late Pope John Paul II in 2002.</P>
      <P>If the Pope cannot come to Taiwan, a special envoy or a representative is
expected to attend the celebrations next year, Hung said.</P>
      <P>The eight-member Taiwanese delegation, including bishops and auxiliary bishops,
are slated to leave for the Vatican on Dec. 6. Their trip will last until Dec.
15.</P>
      <P>The delegation will also report on Taiwan's dioceses' exchanges with Chinese
churches, such as donations of books.</P>
      <P>The Catholic Church was established in Taiwan in 1859 when three Spanish
Dominican priests from the Philippines and five Chinese missionaries arrived in
the southern port city of Kaohsiung, and built the island's first Catholic
church.</P>
      <P>Catholicism actually first arrived on the island in the 17th Century when Taiwan
was occupied by Spanish people. But the brief missions were interrupted when
Chinese people defeated foreigners and claimed the island.</P>
      <P>According to policies of the Roman Catholic Church, residential diocesan bishops
are supposed to visit the pope and report on the state of their dioceses every
five years.</P>
      <P>To celebrate the 150th anniversary, Taiwan's bishops and parish priests plan to
lead 15,000 people to receive the baptism within a year.</P>
      <P>According to Peter Liu Cheng-chung, bishop of the Kaohsiung diocese, the number
of Taiwan's Catholic followers has reached about 300,000 people, and there are
at present 724 Catholic churches, 682 priests and 1,052 nuns in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Miaoli County to launch free after-school program</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Miaoli county government has decided to earmark a budget of NT$70 million
(US$2.09 million) to allow elementary school students in the northern county to
attend free after-school classes from next February, county officials said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The educational program has been designed for first-to-fourth graders so that
parents can leave their children at school until they finish work and are able
to collect them and take them home, the officials</P>
      <P>On average, wage earners in Taiwan get off work at 5 p.m., first- and second-
graders  finish school at noon,  while third-  and fourth-graders usually finish
at noon on Wednesday and Friday and at 4 p.m. during the rest of the week.</P>
      <P>Rather than being left to wander the streets until their parents get home, the
students will be given the opportunity to sharpen their reading and writing
skills and will also be able to play sports under the supervision of teachers,
the officials said.</P>
      <P>Cheng Lai-chang, director of the Ministry of Education's (MOE's) Department of
Elementary Education, said the ministry is pleased that the local government has
decided to set up the program to benefit all of the county's first-to-fourth
graders and their parents as well.</P>
      <P>Since 2003, Cheng said, the MOE has offered free after-school education program
for schoolchildren of the socially disadvantaged, including low-income,
aboriginal  and physically  and mentally challenged parents, and earmarks NT$200
million every year to finance it.</P>
      <P>To date, 150,000 underprivileged children have benefited from the program, he
added.</P>
      <P>However, asked if the MOE will extend this program to benefit all elementary-
grade children around the country, Cheng said the enormous cost of such a
nationwide program would be exorbitant, making the likelihood of central
government funding unlikely.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan should tighten system to prevent corruption: former HK official</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan should establish a sound system that can prevent any government
officials, whoever they may be, from engaging in corruption, a former official
of Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) said in Taipei
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Stephen Char, a former senior corruption prevention officer with the ICAC, made
the suggestion while giving a lecture at the Control Yuan -- Taiwan's watchdog
body -- on the operations of the ICAC. He will give two more lectures on the
same subject during his stay in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Offering his view on the ongoing investigation into allegations of embezzlement,
bribe-taking  and money laundering by former President Chen Shui-bian, Char said
the people of Taiwan should ask: "Why did he have the opportunities to do that?"</P>
      <P>Taiwan should set up a system that can prevent anyone who sits in that position
from having the opportunity to engage in corruption, he suggested.</P>
      <P>"It is the 21st century now. We cannot pray to God to give us an uncorrupt head
of state, but we can establish the right system so that anyone who takes that
position will not be able to engage in corruption, and if he does, people will
know immediately," Char said.</P>
      <P>He said that if Taiwan wants to set up an anti-corruption organization in the
government similar to Hong Kong's ICAC, the lawmakers preparing the legislation
need to consider which government department should have the portfolio.</P>
      <P>In Char's opinion, if the anti-corruption body is placed under the Ministry of
Justice, it will be at too low a level.</P>
      <P>The ICAC answers directly to the chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, he said. However, even so, the chief executive does not
have the right to interfere in cases being handled by the ICAC, he added.</P>
      <P>According to Char, Taiwan is in a good position to push for corruption-free
government because its people are well-educated, and its free news media can
play the role of a watchdog against government corruption.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President pledges to uphold Constitution in promoting ties with China</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Nov. 3 (CNA)
12/03/08  19:12:30

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou pledged Wednesday to abide by the Constitution and the
"1992 consensus" on the "one China, separate interpretation" issue in promoting
relations with China and other countries.</P>
      <P>Ma said that while  his administration  believes  improved Taiwan-China
relations will help remove many of the barriers the country faces in trying to
expand its international participation, the government will not harbor any
unrealistic thoughts and will deal with the situation very carefully.</P>
      <P>During an interview with Radio Taiwan International, Ma pointed to ruling
Kuomintang Honorary Chairman Lien Chan's recent attendance as the president's
envoy at the 2008 informal leaders summit of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum as a successful experience.</P>
      <P>Lien, who is also a former Republic of China vice president, was the most
prominent figure to be appointed Taiwan's presidential envoy to APEC and was
able to take part in the event on an equal footing with other APEC leaders, Ma
said.</P>
      <P>The president said he was deeply moved by Lien's inclusion because Taiwan has
long aspired to have a voice in the international arena, and for the first time,
Taiwan "has made it at APEC."</P>
      <P>"If we deal with cross-strait relations properly, our space in this aspect will
probably increase as well," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma said he believes Taiwan and China should not only reconcile across the Taiwan
Strait but also in the international community, as international participation
is an area in which Taiwan's people can find dignity.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, besides the progress at APEC, Taiwan's stable relations with
its diplomatic allies over the past six months have also been due to the
government's efforts to improve cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, the government hopes to achieve greater progress in promoting
Taiwan's bid to participate in the World Health Assembly and will discuss the
issue with China during future cross-strait talks, he said.</P>
      <P>On the next round of cross-strait talks -- likely to take place in the first
half of next year, the president said the government will prioritize long-
delayed economic issues such as the signing of a memorandum of understanding on
cooperation in financial supervision and regulations, cooperation on fighting
crime and the signing of an investment protection pact.</P>
      <P>Responding to allegations by opposition Democratic Progressive Party politicians
that his administration  has been promoting relations with China at the expense
of Taiwan's sovereignty, Ma challenged the accusers to specify in what way the
six cross-strait agreements signed over the past several months have undermined
Taiwan's sovereignty or dignity.</P>
      <P>The ROC's status as a sovereign state has not been changed, nor has his status
as ROC president, Ma noted.</P>
      <P>The "1992 consensus" that allows Taipei and Beijing to agree to disagree on the
meaning of "one China" -- based on which cross-strait dialogue was resumed --
does not involve a sacrifice of the country's sovereignty, either, because the
ROC Constitution was established under a "one China (Republic of China)"
framework, he argued.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, Taiwan's efforts to improve ties with China have won the
support of the international community and have helped Taiwan shed its image as
a "troublemaker."</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's relations with the United States, Ma said his administration will
continue to work to rebuild mutual trust between the two sides.</P>
      <P>He added that the recovery of Taiwan-U.S. trust over the past six months has
allowed the two sides to deal with each other in a more friendly manner than
before, which is evident in the progress on U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Demolition work at Losheng sanatorium begins despite protest</HEADLINE>

12/03/08  19:39:31

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) began work Wednesday to dismantle
and relocate the historic Losheng Sanatorium despite a protest by 200 activists
demanding that the 1930-era building built to house lepers should be preserved.</P>
      <P>Although the sanatorium has not been designated as a historic site, it will be
reopened to the public in the form of a modern medical treatment park for
leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, said Huang Kun-chang, chief executive
officer of the DOH Hospital Administration Commission.</P>
      <P>The park, which will accommodate some of the old sanatorium buildings, will
serve as a significant educational site to show people of the lack of human
rights afforded to lepers, who were in the past mostly segregated from the rest
of society, Huang noted.</P>
      <P>According to Losheng Sanatorium President Lee Nai-shu, 44 of the 55 old
buildings that comprise the sanatorium will be repaired, one will be relocated,
eight in poorer condition will be dismantled and restored in their original
locations, and the six most dilapidated will be torn down for good.</P>
      <P>Under the construction plan, 90 percent of the sanatorium complex will be
preserved. Lee said.</P>
      <P>The work will make way for the long-stalled construction of a depot for the
Sinjhuang Line of the Mass Rapid Transport system, which will resolve serious
traffic congestion in the Sinjhuang and Shulin areas of Taipei County.</P>
      <P>The decision to tear down some of the buildings is not without controversy,
however, and before workers began erecting fences surrounding the sanatorium in
preparation for the demolition, 200 activists, as well as several elderly
inmates who have lived in the shelter almost all their lives, staged a protest
sit-in.</P>
      <P>More than 200 police officers were mobilized to evict the protesters, which they
did by bundling several dozen of them into vehicles and driving them to a remote
mountainous area in nearby Linkuo, where they planned to dump them to prevent
them from returning to the site.</P>
      <P>In Linkuo, however, the activists -- including members of the Losheng Youth
Alliance and Yu Chao-ching, a professor at the architecture  department of Chung
Yuan Christian University -- protested to the police for taking them against
their will to a place where they could not easily find their way back to the
city.</P>
      <P>After negotiations, the police agreed to drive them to Danshuei, more than an
hour's drive from Sinjhuang but situated on an MRT line.</P>
      <P>The fight to preserve the sanatorium -- one of just three remaining historic
leper facilities in the world -- can be traced back to 2001, when the county
government decided to transform Losheng into a community hospital, bringing to
an end its time as a place exclusively for the hospitalization and care of
leprosy patients.</P>
      <P>Since then, scholars of urban planning, student activists and dozens of Hansen's
disease patients who have lived at Losheng nearly all their lives have been
striving to make the government designate the sanatorium as a historical site.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairman Richard Bush said Wednesday
that more mutual trust between Taiwan and China needs to be built to create a
stable environment in which both sides can co-exist and prosper.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar in Taipei to discuss the development of cross-Taiwan
Strait relations since President Ma Ying-jeou took office, Bush, now director of
the Brookings Center for Northeast Asian Policy Studies (CNAPS), said Ma's
assumption of the presidency offered the possibility  of reducing cross-strait
tension and hostility.</P>
      <P>Bush said, however, that while Ma, who argued that Taiwans prosperity and
security are best ensured by reassuring and engaging China, has launched a
series of initiatives to improve cross-strait relations since he took the helm
and achieved some results, it remains to be seen whether mutual trust between
the two sides will be developed.</P>
      <P>He noted that China still imposes diplomatic quarantine to obstruct Taiwans
participation in international matters and would not give up resorting to
military means if the island were to declare independence.</P>
      <P>The process of economic cooperation is not enough to reduce Taiwan peoples
fear,Bush said.</P>
      <P>The two sides reached agreements to expand direct flights and to launch direct
shipping and postal links during a round of talks last month. They plan to
discuss financial cooperation in the next round of negotiations. Both sides are
avoiding political issues for now.</P>
      <P>Bush said he hopes Beijing wouldshow more flexibilitytoward Taiwans bid to
participate in U.N. activities, such as its hopes of gaining observer status in
the World Health Organization, and find a way to reduce the Taiwan peoples sense
of insecurity.</P>
      <P>He stressed that mutual trust is vital to reach the ultimate goal of
stabilization across the Taiwan Strait, an environment in which he said the two
sides can coexist, cooperate without mutual fear, as well as maximize
opportunities for cooperation.</P>
      <P>The road to creating the environment is not an easy one," Bush said, adding that
if the two sides can successfully achieve the goal with joint efforts, it will
not only serve the best interests for the two governments and their people, the
United States willno doubt welcome itas well.</P>
      <P>He said he was encouraged to see the current incremental negotiation processes
taken by the two sides to deal with cross-strait relations, becauseit is risky
to try to do it all at once between two adversaries who seek to back away from
the situation of mutual fear and mistrust."</P>
      <P>If the current process is to succeed, it will be the result of a gradual step-
by-step process where the two sides can build mutual trust,he contended.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President suggests China watch Taiwan film to learn about Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou on Wednesday suggested people in China should watch a
Taiwanese-produced box office hit to learn more about the island and its
culture, despite a story line which mainland Chinese might find offensive.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks  in an interview  with Radio  Taiwan International after
reports said that China hesitated in airing the locally produced "Cape No. 7",
which depicts the love stories between two Taiwanese-Japanese couples.</P>
      <P>According to the local United Daily News Monday, China has suspended a plan to
show "Cape No.7" prior to Chinese New Year, which falls on Jan. 26 next year,
citing the Beijing-based newspaper Legal Mirror.</P>
      <P>The reports suggested that officials in Beijing were worried that the airing of
the film might whip up nationalistic sentiments in China, as the film touches on
Japan's colonization of Taiwan from 1895 to 1945.</P>
      <P>One of the love stories is about a Taiwanese woman and a Japanese man's
unrequited love during that period of the island's history.</P>
      <P>Ma said viewing the film from a human nature perspective will help Chinese
audiences rest their adverse sentiments on certain scenes and stories and focus
on ordinary people's relationships that are "faithfully captured" in the film.</P>
      <P>Japan's colonization of Taiwan lasted for half a century and it is impossible to
deny that people can develop relationships in such a long time, he said.</P>
      <P>He added that similar stories can certainly be found in China as its
northeastern area was under control by Japan from 1932-1945, and can even be
found between the two sides across the Taiwan Strait, which until recently had
suffered from strained relations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China split in 1949 after a civil war. China adopts a much more
unforgiving view of Japan's World War II occupation of China, partly because of
widespread wartime atrocities carried out by Japanese troops there, including
the Nanjing Massacre and the use of Chinese people for chemical experiments.</P>
      <P>Ma, nonetheless, highly recommended the film, saying it will be a good start for
Chinese people to learn more about the society in Taiwan, which has been
separated from theirs for 60 years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>200,000 workers to benefit from special loans: labor chief</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Minister Wang Ju-hsuan agreed Wednesday to double
the size of a special loan package for workers in economic straits and offer the
loans at a reduced interest rate of about 2.95 percent, which may benefit some
200,000 workers.</P>
      <P>Wang made the announcement during a committee meeting at the Legislative Yuan in
response to a proposal by lawmakers that the CLA increase the size of the loan
package from NT$10 billion to NT$20 billion (US$600 million) -- the biggest in
history -- and lower the interest rate to a record 2.95 percent from the
original 3.225 percent.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers  argued that the CLA should provide greater assistance to the
working class, particularly at this time of economic crisis which has resulted
in many people losing their jobs.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's jobless rate climbed to 4.37 percent in October, bringing the number of
unemployed workers to some 476,000, ruling Kuomintang Legislator Ho Tsai-feng
said during a question-and-answer session. In December 2007, the country's
unemployment rate stood at 3.83 percent, which represented an unemployed
population of 414,000, she noted.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the plan, as many as 200,000 Taiwanese workers could each
receive a loan of up to NT$100,000, as long as they have been in the labor
insurance program for at least 15 years and have never defaulted on their
premium payments.</P>
      <P>In two weeks' time, the CLA will publish relevant information on how to apply
for the loans. Successful applicants are expected to receive the funds before
the Lunar New Year which falls on Jan. 26, 2009.</P>
      <P>Since its inception six years ago, the CLA has been offering special loans for
workers every year ahead of the Chinese new year festival.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Wednesday
that it matters little what the proposed free trade agreement between Taiwan and
China is called, once it is beneficial to Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the SEF, made the remarks at the legislature  while
answering questions from legislators of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party.</P>
      <P>He said it is not really important whether the agreement is called a
comprehensive economic partnership agreement (CEPA), a free trade agreement
(FTA) , or a comprehensive economic cooperation agreement (CECA) -- preferred by
President Ma Ying-jeou -- because the content will be practically the same.</P>
      <P>However, Lai Hsing-yuan, chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) , which has the authority to supervise SEF operations, told the
lawmakers that she has always insisted that Taiwan should not follow the Hong
Kong model and sign a closer economic partnership agreement -- also known as a
CEPA -- with China, because that would downgrade Taiwan to the level of a local
government.</P>
      <P>She said that she would also oppose any other agreement -- even named
differently -- if it signifies a relationship similar to that between China and
Hong Kong -- a special administrative region under China's "one country, two
systems."</P>
      <P>Chiang later told reporters  that he would attach greater importance to the
content rather than to the name of the proposed agreement, which would allow
zero tariffs on up to 90 percent of Taiwan's exports to China.</P>
      <P>Chiang acknowledged that the closer economic partnership between Hong Kong and
China is different in structure from free trade agreements between nations.</P>
      <P>He gave the assurance that if the SEF is authorized by the MAC to sign an
economic cooperation agreement with its Chinese counterpart, the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, he will make sure that Taiwan is not
downgraded in the agreement to a local government of China.</P>
      <P>The  SEF  and the ARATS  are quasi-official  organizations representing each
side of the Taiwan Strait in talks on issues related to cross-strait exchanges,
in the absence of official ties.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With Taipei's Maokong Gondola cable car system shut down over safety concerns,
environmentalists on Wednesday threatened to file a lawsuit against Taiwan's
former Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) minister Hau Lung-bin,
Taipei's current mayor, for not having done an environmental impact assessment
on another project -- the Beitou cable car system.</P>
      <P>The environmentalists asserted that the geological conditions at the site
reserved for the 4.8-km Beitou cable car system in Taipei are unfavorable,
saying that rock strength there is very low and that the site has landslide
risks.</P>
      <P>"If the Beitou cable car system project continues, a worse result than that of
the Maokong Gondola system can be expected, " Lynn Lin, secretary-general of the
Wild at Heart Legal Defense Association, Taiwan, told a press conference.</P>
      <P>In addition, activists said that as the Beitou cable car system is designed to
be located inside the Yangmingshan National Park, the Taipei city government
should review the contractor's soil and water conservation plan before beginning
construction.</P>
      <P>Hau, when he was EPA minister, decided an environmental impact assessment report
was not necessary because the project area was relatively small and the
regulations did not require such environmental impact assessments be conducted
on cable car systems.</P>
      <P>Construction of the project has not officially begun, but contractors in 2006
cut down vegetation and dug holes on the site in preparation for the project,
violating the Soil and Water Conservation Act, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The project to build the Beitou cable car system, mapped out by the Taipei City
Government, was sent to the Yangmingshan National Park Administration in early
October for review, according to the city government's Public Works Department.</P>
      <P>The project is awaiting approval from the park administration and Taiwan's
Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>The environmentalists said that construction should not proceed before concerns
over safety and environmental impact are addressed.</P>
      <P>Urging the Taipei city government to make the cable car project submit to an
environmental impact assessment and take citizens' safety into consideration,
the environmentalists said they did not rule out the possibility of filing a
lawsuit against Taipei Mayor Hau.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, it remains unclear when the 4-km Maokong Gondola cable car system
will resume operation.</P>
      <P>Located in the south of the capital, it began operations in July 2007 and was a
popular tourist attraction. But the system has been closed since October 1 over
concerns that its Tower No. 16 could collapse after torrential rains brought by
Typhoon Jangmei in September eroded the base of the tower.</P>

      <P>The time is not yet ripe for the outlying Kinmen County to lure investment or
admit workers from China, Kao Chang, deputy secretary-general of the National
Security Council, said in Kinmen Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"For the time being, it is more suitable for Kinmen to develop its tourism," Kao
said during a meeting with Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng to exchange
opinions on the development of cross-Taiwan Strait ties.</P>
      <P>Kao was invited to Kinmen by the Kinmen Defense Command to give a military
strategy lecture to troops stationed on the island.</P>
      <P>Kao's comments were made in response to a suggestion by Lee for Kinmen to admit
Chinese workers and allow China investment in order to help bolster the local
economy and allow the offshore island to serve as an experimental case for
Taiwan proper in this regard.</P>
      <P>Kao said it is not a good time for Kinmen to take that approach, considering
that Kinmen has no manufacturing or labor intensive job opportunities. Kinmen
cannot compete with Xiamen, a port city on the opposite side of the strait in
China's Fujian Province, to offer Chinese workers such jobs, he added.</P>
      <P>However, Kinmen is ideally positioned to boost its tourism, thanks to its
historic role as a military bastion against Chinese communist invasion in the
past and a recent decision by Beijing to allow more Chinese tourists to visit
Taiwan proper and several of its offshore islands, including Kinmen, Matsu and
Penghu, he proposed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China inked two landmark accords in June in Beijing, to allow Chinese
tourists from 13 provinces and cities to visit Taiwan, and to establish non-stop
charter flights on weekends.</P>
      <P>The two sides expanded the scope of the two pacts during their talks in Taipei
in November, allowing Chinese residents from more cities and provinces to make
pleasure trips to Taiwan and expanding the weekend charter flights to a daily
service that is slated to begin Dec. 15.</P>
      <P>The direct air travel network between Taiwan proper and China will not exclude
Kinmen from the cross-strait exchanges, but rather would help Kinmen to lure
more "genuine" Chinese tourists, instead of just Chinese travelers who transit
through the island to and from Taiwan, Kao said.</P>
      <P>He suggested that Kinmen authorities use the opportunity to improve the quality
of the island's tourism facilities and services to woo more Chinese tourists.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that China's President Hu Jintao raised
the issue of signing a peace accord with Taiwan about one year ago, which Ma
said was an indication that China wants peace as much as Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hu's aim was to end cross-Taiwan Strait hostilities, not to ensnare Taiwan, the
president said.</P>
      <P>Ma made the statement  at a tea party hosted by the Taiwan Foreign
Correspondents' Club at Sherwood Hotel in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"Both sides of the Taiwan Strait want a peace accord, " said Ma. "However, it is
not a pressing issue."</P>
      <P>Ma noted that since he took office in May, the ambience of the cross-strait
relationship has improved greatly.</P>
      <P>"Hostilities have decreased to the lowest point in cross-strait history," said
Ma. "We will deal with the easy issues first, and then we will move on to the
more difficult ones. This is why we are talking about economics first and then
will go on to political issues."</P>
      <P>Ma said that the issue of Chinese missiles aimed at Taiwan remains a major cause
for concern.</P>
      <P>The prerequisite for a cross-strait peace accord is that the two sides show
goodwill toward each other, " the president said. "But right now, the people of
Taiwan are still very much afraid because of the more than 1,000 (Chinese)
missiles aimed at Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Ma said his government will insist that the missiles be removed before signing
any peace pact with China.</P>
      <P>More than a year ago, Hu raised the issue of a peace accord between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait, " said Ma. "He did so not to set a trap for us, but
to end cross-strait hostilities."</P>
      <P>However, Ma stressed that mutual trust must first be established, especially
between the military of both sides.</P>
      <P>"This is so that the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait will feel safe,"
Ma said.</P>
      <P>He added that the content of the proposed peace pact has not been decided, but
the government of Taiwan will ensure that it benefits the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>"Both sides need to devote more time and energy to cross-strait negotiations
before such an accord can be realized," he added.</P>
      <P>When asked by reporters if he would like to meet Hu or China Premier Wen Jiabao,
Ma replied,I do not have any such plans at the moment, but I do not object to
the idea, I do not rule out the possibility."</P>
      <P>Noting that he has devoted great effort to improving cross-strait ties,  Ma
reiterated  that  his  cross-strait  policy  is "no re-unification, no
independence and no use of force."</P>
      <P>He said he will maintain these policies, as they have the support of the people.</P>
      <P>"As for the cross-strait battle to gain allies, both sides have called a truce,
" said Ma, adding that Beijing showed goodwill by allowing former Vice President
Lien Chan to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Peru
recently.</P>
      <P>"Beijing is being very flexible," he said.</P>
      <P>While this is a sign that the cross-strait atmosphere is improving, Ma said, his
government is not naive enough to interpret it as a "green light."</P>
      <P>"We will continue to seek mutual interest and consensus to further develop
cross-strait ties," the president vowed..</P>
      <P>As for the Taiwan's efforts to participate in the World Health Assembly next
year, Ma said that Beijing has not yet raised that issue.</P>
      <P>"But we will keep investing our efforts in that direction, " he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan people remain wary of engaging China: VP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.3 (CNA)
12/03/08  23:52:26
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew said Wednesday Taiwan people remain wary of engaging
China mainly because Taiwan's eased policy toward China has not yet yielded
obvious interests and Beijing has not responded favorably to Taiwan's appeals
for an end to military threat and diplomatic isolation.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks in a speech delivered at a lunch meeting in Taipei
organized by the Brookings Center for Northeast Asian Policy Studies (CNAPS), a
noted U.S. think tank.</P>
      <P>Although tensions in relations across the Taiwan Strait have thawed  since  the
inauguration  of President  Ma Ying-jeou's administration in May, Siew said a
spate of large-scale street protests seen during top Chinese negotiator Chen
Yunlin's historic visit to Taiwan early last month indicate that more efforts
must be done to alleviate  local people's wariness toward cross-strait
engagements.</P>
      <P>Siew attributed Taiwan people's wariness to two major reasons -- the launch of
direct cross-strait charter flights and Taiwan's opening up to Chinese tourists
has yet to bring about substantial interests and local people find that Beijing
has not shown explicit goodwill response to calls for dismantling more than
1,000 ballistic missiles targeting Taiwan and for stopping its boycott of
Taiwan's presence in world arenas.</P>
      <P>At the moment, Siew said, China still deploys 1,400 missiles against Taiwan and
has not shown any intention to compromise on Taiwan's participation in the
annual World Health Assembly (WHA) meetings and East Asian economic integration.</P>
      <P>"Only when these critical issues are resolved can people of Taiwan reach a
higher degree of consensus on the development of cross-strait relations, " Siew
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Siew said Taiwan needs the support of major countries around the
world, including the United States, in its pursuit of representation in the WHA
and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</P>
      <P>In light of Taiwan's contribution to the world economy, Siew said he sees no
reasons for ASEAN to exclude Taiwan from regional economic integration.</P>
      <P>On relations with the United States, Siew said he looks forward to seeing
progress in major bilateral cooperation projects, including negotiations for
signing a Taiwan-U.S. free trade agreement (FTA) , following the inauguration of
President-elect Barack Obama next month.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying Jeou said Wednesday that all religious leaders in the world
are welcome to visit Taiwan, but that the timing for a visit by the Dalai Lama
is not right.</P>
      <P>In response to questions by foreign press members at a tea party press hosted by
the Taiwan Foreign Correspondence Club in Taipei, Ma noted that the exiled
Tibetan spiritual leader has visited Taiwan twice in the past.</P>
      <P>We generally welcome all religious leaders in the world to come to Taiwan, but I
think, at the moment, the timing isn't appropriate for this," he said. Ma was
responding to question on whether he and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would
approve a visit to the country by Dalai Lama, who has said that he is
considering the idea.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama is seeking autonomy for Tibet, rather than independence, from
China.</P>
      <P>Turning to the issue of a possible presidential pardon for former President Chen
Shui-bian, Ma said in response to a reporter's question that "a presidential
pardon is possible in our country, but we have to wait for an indictment before
we could consider pardoning Chen. Right now, he is only a suspect."</P>
      <P>Chen has been detained and is being investigated on suspicion of embezzlement,
bribe-taking and money laundering during his two terms in office from 2000 to
2008.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ma said that in the face of the global economic crisis, his
government is ready to rescue any Taiwan industry that falls into trouble.</P>
      <P>"The DRAM industry has its own survival plans, but we are on standby, ready to
help if it asks for our help," he said.</P>
      <P>In addition, I will not give up my policy of targeting 6 percent economic
growth, per capita income of US$30,000 and an unemployment rate of below 3
percent," the president said when asked if the global credit crisis will dampen
Taiwan's economic outlook.</P>
      <P>Ma pointed out that his government is borrowing money and using special budgets
to fund expanded public projects.</P>
      <P>"We have to implement the expansion of public projects to stimulate the economy,
" Ma said. "When the economy gets better, the government could pay off its
debts."</P>
      <P>When asked if a Cabinet reshuffle is imminent following the recent resignation
and replacement of the Financial Supervisory Commission chairman, Ma replied, "
There will be no more changes until the end of this year. But my evaluations of
the Cabinet are ongoing. I hope that the Cabinet will be able to satisfy the
needs of the people."</P>
      <P>The reporters also questioned Ma on Taiwan's defense policy, asking if his
government would still like to purchase submarines and F-16 warplanes.</P>
      <P>"I do not think the Obama administration will change its position on selling
defensive weapons to Taiwan, " replied Ma. "We continue to request permission to
purchase F-16C/D fighter planes for defense."</P>
      <P>Ma explained that his government's purchase of arms does not mean it is seeking
hostilities in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>However, "we still need to deter China. I do not want to see the use of force,
but we must take the necessary precautions against the other side of the Taiwan
Strait."</P>

      <P>Hu's aim was to end cross-Taiwan Strait hostilities, not to ensnare Taiwan, the
president said.</P>
      <P>Ma made the statement  at a tea party hosted by the Taiwan Foreign
Correspondents' Club at Sherwood Hotel in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"Both sides of the Taiwan Strait want a peace accord, " said Ma. "However, it is
not a pressing issue."</P>
      <P>Ma noted that since he took office in May, the ambience of the cross-strait
relationship has improved greatly.</P>
      <P>"Hostilities have decreased to the lowest point in cross-strait history," said
Ma. "We will deal with the easy issues first, and then we will move on to the
more difficult ones. This is why we are talking about economics first and then
will go on to political issues."</P>
      <P>Ma said that the issue of Chinese missiles aimed at Taiwan remains a major cause
for concern.</P>
      <P>The prerequisite for a cross-strait peace accord is that the two sides show
goodwill toward each other, " the president said. "But right now, the people of
Taiwan are still very much afraid because of the more than 1,000 (Chinese)
missiles aimed at Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Ma said his government will insist that the missiles be removed before signing
any peace pact with China.</P>
      <P>More than a year ago, Hu raised the issue of a peace accord between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait, " said Ma. "He did so not to set a trap for us, but
to end cross-strait hostilities."</P>
      <P>However, Ma stressed that mutual trust must first be established, especially
between the military of both sides.</P>
      <P>"This is so that the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait will feel safe,"
Ma said.</P>
      <P>He added that the content of the proposed peace pact has not been decided, but
the government of Taiwan will ensure that it benefits the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>"Both sides need to devote more time and energy to cross-strait negotiations
before such an accord can be realized," he added.</P>
      <P>When asked by reporters if he would like to meet Hu or China Premier Wen Jiabao,
Ma replied,I do not have any such plans at the moment, but I do not object to
the idea, I do not rule out the possibility."</P>
      <P>Noting that he has devoted great effort to improving cross-strait ties,  Ma
reiterated  that  his  cross-strait  policy  is "no re-unification, no
independence and no use of force."</P>
      <P>He said he will maintain these policies, as they have the support of the people.</P>
      <P>"As for the cross-strait battle to gain allies, both sides have called a truce,
" said Ma, adding that Beijing showed goodwill by allowing former Vice President
Lien Chan to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Peru
recently.</P>
      <P>"Beijing is being very flexible," he said.</P>
      <P>While this is a sign that the cross-strait atmosphere is improving, Ma said, his
government is not naive enough to interpret it as a "green light."</P>
      <P>"We will continue to seek mutual interest and consensus to further develop
cross-strait ties," the president vowed..</P>
      <P>As for the Taiwan's efforts to participate in the World Health Assembly next
year, Ma said that Beijing has not yet raised that issue.</P>
      <P>"But we will keep investing our efforts in that direction, " he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan people remain wary of engaging China: VP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.3 (CNA)
12/03/08  23:52:26
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew said Wednesday Taiwan people remain wary of engaging
China mainly because Taiwan's eased policy toward China has not yet yielded
obvious interests and Beijing has not responded favorably to Taiwan's appeals
for an end to military threat and diplomatic isolation.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks in a speech delivered at a lunch meeting in Taipei
organized by the Brookings Center for Northeast Asian Policy Studies (CNAPS), a
noted U.S. think tank.</P>
      <P>Although tensions in relations across the Taiwan Strait have thawed  since  the
inauguration  of President  Ma Ying-jeou's administration in May, Siew said a
spate of large-scale street protests seen during top Chinese negotiator Chen
Yunlin's historic visit to Taiwan early last month indicate that more efforts
must be done to alleviate  local people's wariness toward cross-strait
engagements.</P>
      <P>Siew attributed Taiwan people's wariness to two major reasons -- the launch of
direct cross-strait charter flights and Taiwan's opening up to Chinese tourists
has yet to bring about substantial interests and local people find that Beijing
has not shown explicit goodwill response to calls for dismantling more than
1,000 ballistic missiles targeting Taiwan and for stopping its boycott of
Taiwan's presence in world arenas.</P>
      <P>At the moment, Siew said, China still deploys 1,400 missiles against Taiwan and
has not shown any intention to compromise on Taiwan's participation in the
annual World Health Assembly (WHA) meetings and East Asian economic integration.</P>
      <P>"Only when these critical issues are resolved can people of Taiwan reach a
higher degree of consensus on the development of cross-strait relations, " Siew
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Siew said Taiwan needs the support of major countries around the
world, including the United States, in its pursuit of representation in the WHA
and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</P>
      <P>In light of Taiwan's contribution to the world economy, Siew said he sees no
reasons for ASEAN to exclude Taiwan from regional economic integration.</P>
      <P>On relations with the United States, Siew said he looks forward to seeing
progress in major bilateral cooperation projects, including negotiations for
signing a Taiwan-U.S. free trade agreement (FTA) , following the inauguration of
President-elect Barack Obama next month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President rules out possibility of visit by Dalai Lama at this time</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying Jeou said Wednesday that all religious leaders in the world
are welcome to visit Taiwan, but that the timing for a visit by the Dalai Lama
is not right.</P>
      <P>In response to questions by foreign press members at a tea party press hosted by
the Taiwan Foreign Correspondence Club in Taipei, Ma noted that the exiled
Tibetan spiritual leader has visited Taiwan twice in the past.</P>
      <P>We generally welcome all religious leaders in the world to come to Taiwan, but I
think, at the moment, the timing isn't appropriate for this," he said. Ma was
responding to question on whether he and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would
approve a visit to the country by Dalai Lama, who has said that he is
considering the idea.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama is seeking autonomy for Tibet, rather than independence, from
China.</P>
      <P>Turning to the issue of a possible presidential pardon for former President Chen
Shui-bian, Ma said in response to a reporter's question that "a presidential
pardon is possible in our country, but we have to wait for an indictment before
we could consider pardoning Chen. Right now, he is only a suspect."</P>
      <P>Chen has been detained and is being investigated on suspicion of embezzlement,
bribe-taking and money laundering during his two terms in office from 2000 to
2008.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ma said that in the face of the global economic crisis, his
government is ready to rescue any Taiwan industry that falls into trouble.</P>
      <P>"The DRAM industry has its own survival plans, but we are on standby, ready to
help if it asks for our help," he said.</P>
      <P>In addition, I will not give up my policy of targeting 6 percent economic
growth, per capita income of US$30,000 and an unemployment rate of below 3
percent," the president said when asked if the global credit crisis will dampen
Taiwan's economic outlook.</P>
      <P>Ma pointed out that his government is borrowing money and using special budgets
to fund expanded public projects.</P>
      <P>"We have to implement the expansion of public projects to stimulate the economy,
" Ma said. "When the economy gets better, the government could pay off its
debts."</P>
      <P>When asked if a Cabinet reshuffle is imminent following the recent resignation
and replacement of the Financial Supervisory Commission chairman, Ma replied, "
There will be no more changes until the end of this year. But my evaluations of
the Cabinet are ongoing. I hope that the Cabinet will be able to satisfy the
needs of the people."</P>
      <P>The reporters also questioned Ma on Taiwan's defense policy, asking if his
government would still like to purchase submarines and F-16 warplanes.</P>
      <P>"I do not think the Obama administration will change its position on selling
defensive weapons to Taiwan, " replied Ma. "We continue to request permission to
purchase F-16C/D fighter planes for defense."</P>
      <P>Ma explained that his government's purchase of arms does not mean it is seeking
hostilities in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>However, "we still need to deter China. I do not want to see the use of force,
but we must take the necessary precautions against the other side of the Taiwan
Strait."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan delegation that is currently in India to seek business partners and
trade deals there has attracted great attention from Indian industries,
according to the leader of the group Lee Tung-sen, Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lee, a staff member at Taiwan External Trade Development Council, told the CNA
that the delegation consists of representatives of 18 Taiwan companies that for
two days have been displaying a variety of products at booths set up at the PHD
Chamber of Commerce and Industry in New Delhi.</P>
      <P>The exhibits include machinery, hardware, energy-saving lighting devices,
lathes, packers, textiles, rubber, and chemical equipment, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Representatives of more than 150 Indian enterprises have visited the
delegation's booths, with many showing interest in the Taiwan companies, he
said.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, one Indian company proposed cooperating with Taiwan's Asia
Automatic Pum Co. to make pump products in India.</P>
      <P>Another Indian company expressed interest in supplying Taiwan Dyeing and Fabric
Co. with raw materials, Lee said.</P>
      <P>He said the delegation will move on to Mumbai, India's financial center,
Thursday, and will head to the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo Dec. 7.</P>
      <P>Wong Wen-chi, Taiwan's representative to India, said cooperation between the
business sectors of both countries will create a win-win situation for future
development.</P>
      <P>Lee Chuan-lian, the economy section chief at Taiwan's representative office in
India, noted that India is Taiwan's largest trading partner in South Asia. The
bilateral trade volume between the two countries was US$4.88 billion for 2007,
which represented growth of 80 percent from the 2006 figure.</P>
      <P>The bilateral trade volume from January to June this year exceeded US$3 billion,
representing annualized growth rate of 53 percent, Lee said.</P>
      <P>India's economy was forecast to remain stable in spite of the global economic
downturn, with its economic growth rate for the fiscal year ending March 31,
2009 expected to maintain around 7.5 percent, according to Lee.</P>

      <P>Following on the heels of Taiwan's footwear industry, the bedding industry is
now on the verge of failing, the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The bedding industry's problems are reportedly largely due low-price competition
from manufacturers in China and Vietnam.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 18 manufacturers, including towel, knitted sock and stocking makers,
have been put on a watch list because of the visible problems they are
encountering.</P>
      <P>IDB officials said that if an industry shows abnormal import and export figures
for the past two years, the quoted price of domestic products plunge, or there
is a dramatic increase in similar imports, the IDB will assess the impact on the
industry and place it on a watch list or categorize it as being on the verge of
failing.</P>
      <P>The IDB or the Small and Medium Enterprise Administration will then take steps

      <P>The head of Taoyuan County in northern Taiwan shared an international honor with
information industry leaders at a reception Wednesday after the New York-based
Intelligent Community Forum (ICF) named the county one of 21 smart communities
in the world.</P>
      <P>Taoyuan County Magistrate Li-lun Chu was joined by executives of Chunghwa
Telecom Co., Quanta Computer Inc., Hewlett Packard Co. and Microsoft Taiwan
Corp. at the celebration of the county's emergence from among 400 candidate
cities around the world to win the rare honor.</P>
      <P>Chu signed a letter of intent for future cooperation with the Industrial
Development Bureau under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Chunghwa Telecom and
Global Mobile Corp. on the provision of wireless broadband service in Taoyuan
County.</P>
      <P>Taoyuan County, with a population of 1,950,000, was the only Asian community on
the list of the Smart21 Communities of 2009 announced by the ICF on Oct. 29.</P>
      <P>The ICF is a think tank that studies the economic and social development of the
21st century community. It will name the Top Seven Intelligent Communities of
2009, selected from among the Smart21, on Jan. 21 next year during the Pacific

      <P>"The ingenuity of these communities is exemplified in their investments in the
future of the young, the growth and progress of job-creating businesses, and
economic security," he said. An overarching theme of the 2009 honorees has been
the dedication to putting people first and building a "talent inventory" that
will thrive with technology and innovation, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Losheng Sanatorium controversy in last throes</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  3 (CNA)
12/04/08  01:03:36
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The long-lasting dispute over plans to dismantle the 1930-era Losheng Sanatorium
-- Taiwan's first hospital for lepers -- came to an end Wednesday when police
cleared elderly inmates from a shabby building that they had called home for
most of their lives and dispersed demonstrators who were protesting the
dismantling of the buildings.</P>
      <P>Despite constant  protests  by human rights activists  and preservationists,
work to build a depot for the Sinjhuang Line of the Mass Rapid Transport system
in Taipei,  northern Taiwan,  was restarted.</P>
      <P>According to the Taipei metro department, the inauguration date of the Sinjhuang
line had to be postponed from Dec. 31, 2009 to Aug. 15, 2112 because of the
disputes over the dismantling of the sanatorium and the ensuing disruptions to
the work on the project.</P>
      <P>The controversy over the project, which is being constructed to alleviate the
serious traffic congestion in the Sinjhuang and Shulin areas of the densely
populated Taipei County, has highlighted a period in history when Hansen's
disease patients were deprived of their human rights.</P>
      <P>Hansen's disease, also known as leprosy, is a chronic bacterial disease that
primarily affects the skin, peripheral nerves and upper airway. Because the
disease was feared as highly contagious, Hansen's patients were isolated and
often shunned by the societies in which they lived.</P>
      <P>The disease is now known to be treatable and not highly transmissible.</P>
      <P>Losheng Sanatorium was constructed in 1929 by the Japanese colonial government
on a vast tract of land covering Hueilong and Shulin townships in Taipei County
and Gueishan in Taoyuan County to quarantine patients with the disease.</P>
      <P>After the World War II, the Kuomintang (KMT) regime, inheriting the isolation
policy, expanded the housing facilities to more than 60 units. At its peak, the
sanatorium sheltered nearly 1,000 patients.</P>
      <P>In 1961, the forced quarantine policy was revoked and the patients were allowed
to leave the sanatorium. However, many of them, facing the prospect of chronic
isolation and discrimination, had little choice but to stay, and they grew used
to the setting.</P>
      <P>As urban development accelerated, the metro department selected the 30-hectare
sanatorium complex as the site of a train depot and began 12 years ago to
develop a construction plan.</P>
      <P>In 2003, part of the sanatorium was demolished, forcing some of the more than
200 long-term patients -- aged 75 years on average -- to move away. One year
later, the Youth Federation for Losheng was formed by activists fighting for the
rights of the patients.</P>
      <P>After years of controversy over the issue, the Legislative Yuan on July 18 this
year passed a set of regulations to protect the rights of Hansen's disease
patients. Under the bill, the patients were offered compensation for the
discrimination they suffered due to the segregation policy.</P>
      <P>According to the Department of Health (DOH), the regulations also require the
government to issue a public apology to the patients, hold a public memorial
ceremony for those who have passed away, and educate the society about the
disease.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations, the government will pay a total of NT$720 million (US$
million) to nearly 1,000 Losheng Sanatorium patients as compensation.</P>
      <P>The bill stipulates that 90 percent of the sanatorium compound will be preserved
and part of it will be converted into a park dedicated to educating the society
about Hansen's disease. Forty of the 55 buildings on the sanatorium complex will
be preserved and will continue to serve as home to many of its patients.</P>

      <P>Taiwan hopes to include the regulation of Chinese medicine and animal feed
safety in the next round of cross-Taiwan Strait consultations on food safety,
Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yeh Chin-chuan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Yeh made the remarks while reporting to a legislative committee on a cross-
strait agreement on food safety signed last month in Taipei.</P>
      <P>In its inspection of food products from China, the DOH in recent years has found

pesticides and animal drugs in excess of allowable standards in Taiwan, Yeh
said.</P>
      <P>"The government will communicate with China on these issues within the framework
of the cross-strait food safety agreement," he added.</P>
      <P>Around 90 percent of all Chinese medicines imported by Taiwan are from China, 80
percent of which are usually consumed by the public, he said.</P>
      <P>The DOH will select some of these medicines for priority consultations, he
added.</P>
      <P>He also said that animal feed could also end up in the systems of people via the
food chain and could pose a public heath hazard if it is tainted.</P>

importers have asked for the DOH's assistance to seek compensation from China,

will go on to political issues."</P>
      <P>Ma said that the issue of Chinese missiles aimed at Taiwan remains a major cause
for concern.</P>
      <P>The prerequisite for a cross-strait peace accord is that the two sides show
goodwill toward each other, " the president said. "But right now, the people of
Taiwan are still very much afraid because of the more than 1,000 (Chinese)
missiles aimed at Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Ma said his government will insist that the missiles be removed before signing
any peace pact with China.</P>
      <P>More than a year ago, Hu raised the issue of a peace accord between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait, " said Ma. "He did so not to set a trap for us, but
to end cross-strait hostilities."</P>
      <P>However, Ma stressed that mutual trust must first be established, especially
between the military of both sides.</P>
      <P>"This is so that the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait will feel safe,"
Ma said.</P>
      <P>He added that the content of the proposed peace pact has not been decided, but
the government of Taiwan will ensure that it benefits the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>"Both sides need to devote more time and energy to cross-strait negotiations
before such an accord can be realized," he added.</P>
      <P>When asked by reporters if he would like to meet Hu or China Premier Wen Jiabao,
Ma replied,I do not have any such plans at the moment, but I do not object to
the idea, I do not rule out the possibility."</P>
      <P>Noting that he has devoted great effort to improving cross-strait ties,  Ma
reiterated  that  his  cross-strait  policy  is "no re-unification, no
independence and no use of force."</P>
      <P>He said he will maintain these policies, as they have the support of the people.</P>
      <P>"As for the cross-strait battle to gain allies, both sides have called a truce,
" said Ma, adding that Beijing showed goodwill by allowing former Vice President
Lien Chan to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Peru
recently.</P>
      <P>"Beijing is being very flexible," he said.</P>
      <P>While this is a sign that the cross-strait atmosphere is improving, Ma said, his
government is not naive enough to interpret it as a "green light."</P>
      <P>"We will continue to seek mutual interest and consensus to further develop
cross-strait ties," the president vowed..</P>
      <P>As for the Taiwan's efforts to participate in the World Health Assembly next
year, Ma said that Beijing has not yet raised that issue.</P>
      <P>"But we will keep investing our efforts in that direction, " he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan people remain wary of engaging China: VP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.3 (CNA)
12/04/08  11:35:17
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew said Wednesday Taiwan people remain wary of engaging
China mainly because Taiwan's eased policy toward China has not yet yielded
obvious interests and Beijing has not responded favorably to Taiwan's appeals
for an end to military threat and diplomatic isolation.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks in a speech delivered at a lunch meeting in Taipei
organized by the Brookings Center for Northeast Asian Policy Studies (CNAPS), a
noted U.S. think tank.</P>
      <P>Although tensions in relations across the Taiwan Strait have thawed  since  the
inauguration  of President  Ma Ying-jeou's administration in May, Siew said a
spate of large-scale street protests seen during top Chinese negotiator Chen
Yunlin's historic visit to Taiwan early last month indicate that more efforts
must be done to alleviate  local people's wariness toward cross-strait
engagements.</P>
      <P>Siew attributed Taiwan people's wariness to two major reasons -- the launch of
direct cross-strait charter flights and Taiwan's opening up to Chinese tourists
has yet to bring about substantial interests and local people find that Beijing
has not shown explicit goodwill response to calls for dismantling more than
1,000 ballistic missiles targeting Taiwan and for stopping its boycott of
Taiwan's presence in world arenas.</P>
      <P>At the moment, Siew said, China still deploys 1,400 missiles against Taiwan and
has not shown any intention to compromise on Taiwan's participation in the
annual World Health Assembly (WHA) meetings and East Asian economic integration.</P>
      <P>"Only when these critical issues are resolved can people of Taiwan reach a
higher degree of consensus on the development of cross-strait relations, " Siew
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Siew said Taiwan needs the support of major countries around the
world, including the United States, in its pursuit of representation in the WHA
and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</P>
      <P>In light of Taiwan's contribution to the world economy, Siew said he sees no
reasons for ASEAN to exclude Taiwan from regional economic integration.</P>
      <P>On relations with the United States, Siew said he looks forward to seeing
progress in major bilateral cooperation projects, including negotiations for
signing a Taiwan-U.S. free trade agreement (FTA) , following the inauguration of
President-elect Barack Obama next month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President rules out possibility of visit by Dalai Lama at this time</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 3 (CNA)
12/04/08  11:36:01
(By Andrew Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying Jeou said Wednesday that all religious leaders in the world
are welcome to visit Taiwan, but that the timing for a visit by the Dalai Lama
is not right.</P>
      <P>In response to questions by foreign press members at a tea party press hosted by
the Taiwan Foreign Correspondence Club in Taipei, Ma noted that the exiled
Tibetan spiritual leader has visited Taiwan twice in the past.</P>
      <P>We generally welcome all religious leaders in the world to come to Taiwan, but I
think, at the moment, the timing isn't appropriate for this," he said. Ma was
responding to question on whether he and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would
approve a visit to the country by Dalai Lama, who has said that he is
considering the idea.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama is seeking autonomy for Tibet, rather than independence, from
China.</P>
      <P>Turning to the issue of a possible presidential pardon for former President Chen
Shui-bian, Ma said in response to a reporter's question that "a presidential
pardon is possible in our country, but we have to wait for an indictment before
we could consider pardoning Chen. Right now, he is only a suspect."</P>
      <P>Chen has been detained and is being investigated on suspicion of embezzlement,
bribe-taking and money laundering during his two terms in office from 2000 to
2008.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ma said that in the face of the global economic crisis, his
government is ready to rescue any Taiwan industry that falls into trouble.</P>
      <P>"The DRAM industry has its own survival plans, but we are on standby, ready to
help if it asks for our help," he said.</P>
      <P>In addition, I will not give up my policy of targeting 6 percent economic
growth, per capita income of US$30,000 and an unemployment rate of below 3
percent," the president said when asked if the global credit crisis will dampen
Taiwan's economic outlook.</P>
      <P>Ma pointed out that his government is borrowing money and using special budgets
to fund expanded public projects.</P>
      <P>"We have to implement the expansion of public projects to stimulate the economy,
" Ma said. "When the economy gets better, the government could pay off its
debts."</P>
      <P>When asked if a Cabinet reshuffle is imminent following the recent resignation
and replacement of the Financial Supervisory Commission chairman, Ma replied, "
There will be no more changes until the end of this year. But my evaluations of
the Cabinet are ongoing. I hope that the Cabinet will be able to satisfy the
needs of the people."</P>
      <P>The reporters also questioned Ma on Taiwan's defense policy, asking if his
government would still like to purchase submarines and F-16 warplanes.</P>
      <P>"I do not think the Obama administration will change its position on selling
defensive weapons to Taiwan, " replied Ma. "We continue to request permission to
purchase F-16C/D fighter planes for defense."</P>
      <P>Ma explained that his government's purchase of arms does not mean it is seeking
hostilities in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>However, "we still need to deter China. I do not want to see the use of force,
but we must take the necessary precautions against the other side of the Taiwan
Strait."</P>

      <P>Taiwan's economic growth will be 1.68</P>
      <P>percent for this year and 1.24 percent for next year, a think tank forecast
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Chung-Hwa Institution for Economic Research (CIER) made the forecast at a
seminar on the 2009 global economic outlook, which was hosted by CIER President
Daigee Shaw.</P>
      <P>Wang  Lee-rong,  director  of CIER's  Center  for Economic Forecasting, said
that with the global economic downturn, the center has decided to adjust its
forecast for domestic economic growth sharply downwards.</P>
      <P>The jobless rate for next year has been forecast at 4.35 percent, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The CIER predicted in October that economic growth could reach 3.82 percent this
year, and 3.34 percent next year.</P>
      <P>Wang said that if the world financial crisis continues to worsen, and economic
growth for the United States, Japan and China also deteriorate, then "Taiwan's
economic growth could be negative 0.92 percent next year."</P>
      <P>Among all the domestic think tanks, the CIER has made the most pessimistic
economic forecast, while the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research has been the
most optimistic, predicting an economic growth this year of 4.08 precent, and
4.11 percent for next year.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics also
adjusted its forecast for 2008 and 2009 economic growth sharply downward to 1.87
percent and 2.12 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>CIER officials said the world financial crisis has had the biggest impact on the
banking and insurance sectors, but that the plastics and chemical, steel, cement
and shipping sectors have also been affected.</P>
      <P>With the economic slowdown in Europe and the United States, the market for
large-size panels, computer memory and personal computers will shrink, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>In addition,  due  to rising  unemployment  and  decreased consumption, the
wholesale and retail, eatery and real estate sectors will also be affected, they
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Former Investigation Bureau head gets 10-year prison sentence</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB) Director-General Yeh
Sheng-mao was sentenced Thursday to 10 years in prison over his handling of
intelligence concerning a case of suspected money laundering involving former
President Chen Shui-bian  and a separate case of alleged influence  peddling
implicating a legislator.</P>
      <P>A panel of judges at the Taipei District Court ruled that Yeh should also be
deprived of his civil rights for five years.</P>
      <P>The court found Yeh guilty of corruption, of concealing a government file and of
leaking confidential information, for which he was given a prison sentence of
eight and a half years.</P>
      <P>In the second  case,  Yeh was also convicted  of leaking confidential
information, for which he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.</P>
      <P>The two sentences will combined into a jail term of 10 years, the verdict
stated. The ruling can be appealed.</P>
      <P>Also Thursday, the court rejected a bail petition by Yeh -- who has been
detained since Oct. 6 -- in view of the severity of the offenses with which he
was charged.</P>
      <P>At the center of the money-laundering case was a report delivered to the MJIB in
January  through the international  anti-money laundering organization Egmont
Group, in which the Cayman Islands' financial intelligence unit raised the
suspicion that the former first family was laundering money through an account
created under the name of Chen's daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching at the Merrill
Lynch Bank in Geneva, Switzerland.</P>
      <P>Based on the report, the bureau's Anti-Money Laundering Center on Jan. 29
compiled a file intended for delivery to the Supreme Prosecutors Office. Yeh
later requested that the file be handed over to him, saying that he would pass
it to State Public Prosecutor General Chen Tsung-ming in person.</P>
      <P>However, instead of giving the file to Chen Tsung-ming, Yeh leaked its contents
to Chen Shui-bian during a visit to the former president's official residence
between Jan. 31 and Feb. 1.</P>
      <P>The district court said in its verdict that Yeh's actions had undermined the
independence of Taiwan's justice institutions and caused "immeasurable damage"
to the country's image.</P>
      <P>However, Yeh has not been repentant, had changed his statement many times during
the trial and refused to admit to his offenses, the verdict stated.</P>
      <P>In the other case, Yeh was found to have leaked a plan by prosecutors and
investigators to raid the offices of Democratic Progressive  Party Legislator
Ker Chien-ming  in April in an investigation into Ker's alleged involvement in
influence peddling in an illegal mining operation in the eastern county of
Hualien.</P>

      <P>Taipei City has established sister city links with Ouagadougou, the capital of
Burkina Faso, and will donate ambulances to help improve medical conditions
there, Taipei City Mayor Hau Lung-bin announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hau said at the signing ceremony that the two cities first established ties in
2002 during a visit to Taipei by the mayor of Ouagadougou, and that the new
alliance will further enhance mutual trust and facilitate partnerships between
the two diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>The two cities are expected to launch various initiatives and collaborate in
areas such as public affairs management, information technology, transportation,
the environment and health, according to Hau.</P>
      <P>As a first step, Hau pledged that his city will donate four ambulances to
Ouagadougou and will assist with the construction of a youth center in the
African city, known for its craftsmanship, to provide a space for its culture to
thrive.</P>
      <P>In response, Ouagadougou Mayor Simon Compaore said that the donation of
ambulances will help alleviate the lack of adequate medical facilities in the
Burkina Faso capital.</P>
      <P>Compaore mentioned that Taiwan helped to build the biggest hospital in Burkina
Faso and has sent medical missions to the country, which he said has greatly
benefited his people.</P>
      <P>He said that the people of Burkina Faso know about Taiwan and are familiar with
the cooperation schemes Taiwan launched in the country. The signing of the

    <HEADLINE>10 major infrastructure projects to be carried out 'seriously'</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan passed a resolution Thursday, ruling that the 10 major
infrastructure projects that it has selected for immediate implementation will
be carried out "seriously" and under direct supervision by the nation's four
ministers without portfolio.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said after hearing a briefing on the plan that the 10
selected infrastructure projects, including a mass rapid transit system
connecting the capital city of Taipei and the nearby Taoyuan International
Airport in Taoyuan County, should be carried out as scheduled and of the quality
required.</P>
      <P>"It is also  anticipated  that  the development  of these infrastructure
projects will help rev up the slumping domestic economy and boost employment,"
Liu said.</P>
      <P>The MRT system connecting the Taipei Railway Station and the Taoyuan airport is
envisioned to reduce travel time between the two places to some 35 minutes, from
the current hour or so. It can also provide convenient transit services to some
200,000 travelers to and from the airport and commuters who commute to work at
the airport per day, according to the plan.</P>
      <P>Another project -- an expansion of the Kaohsiung Harbor, the largest seaport in
Taiwan -- is expected to create some 27,000 jobs and generate businesses worth
NT$39.4 billion (US$1.2 billion) when it is completed. The project will be a
joint venture between the government and the private sector, according to Chu
Yun-peng, one of the four ministers without portfolio to be in charge of the
projects.</P>
      <P>The other three ministers without portfolio  will be Tsai Hsung-hsiung, Chang
Jin-fu and Ovid J.L. Tzeng.</P>
      <P>Other infrastructure projects approved include the development of highways;
renovation of cities and industrial zones; rebuilding of old bridges; flood
prevention; revamping of old school buildings; streamlining of sewage systems;
and rebirth of rural villages, according to the plan.</P>

      <P>Local undergraduate and graduate students would be allowed to apply for
extension of their expected period of study for reasons related to parenting,
according to a draft amendment to the University Act adopted by the Cabinet
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The reasons would include pregnancy, childbirth and the care of children under
three years old, stated the draft, which is pending final approval by the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Ho Cho-fei, head of the Department of Higher Education under the Ministry of
Education (MOE) , explained that the bill is intended to protect the rights of
students, who very often are forced to give up their studies because of the
demands of parenting.</P>
      <P>Although the MOE in 2005 directed domestic universities to allow maternity leave
for pregnant students and to deduct the period of absence from their expected
duration of study, some universities have not done so.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, pregnant students would have to ask for sick leave or
private affairs leave instead, in which case they could face a dismissal if they
are absent from more than one third of their classes in a semester.</P>
      <P>If the students choose to withdraw temporarily from university, the maximum
duration of such withdrawal, as stipulated in the University Act, is four years.
In reality, however, most universities only allow a withdrawal of two years at
the maximum.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to join U.S. Visa Waiver Program if it meets requirements:AIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4 (CNA)
12/04/08  17:25:17
(By Luis Yu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The director of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), Stephen M. Young, said
Thursday that the incoming Obama administration will give careful consideration
to including Taiwan in the U.S. Visa Waiver Program if it meets the
requirements.</P>
      <P>During a speech at a luncheon organized by the American Chamber of Commerce in
Taipei, Young said that he would not rule out the possibility that Taiwanese
citizens can get visa-free treatment when they travel to the United States.</P>
      <P>However, Young noted that there are a number of issues that need to be resolved
before Taiwan can be considered for the Visa Waiver Program, which has already
been granted in November to citizens of seven countries, including South Korea.</P>
      <P>Under the Visa Waiver Program, citizens of member countries may travel to the
U.S. visa free for up to 90 days for business or pleasure.</P>
      <P>Young said that the U.S remains a favored destination for study, business, and
leisure for Taiwanese people, but too often the U.S. has found instances where
people who were not Taiwanese citizens have been able to obtain genuine
Taiwanese passports.</P>
      <P>"We applaud Taiwan's efforts to introduce a new passport", said Young, referring
to the "ePassports" which Taiwan plans to unveil at the end of this month.</P>
      <P>The electronic passports are embedded with a chip that contains the biographical
data and the facial image of the passport bearer. They are difficult to forge.</P>
      <P>Young added that the U.S. hopes that the new passports and other measures
including  the strengthening  of passport application procedures will ensure
that passports are not inadvertently issued to people who are not Taiwanese
citizens.</P>
      <P>Young reiterated that the U.S.  recognizes  that Taiwanese travelers to the U.S.
have a strong reputation of abiding by the country's immigration laws and also
most importantly for spending generously while in America, which is why he
thinks that the Obama administration will look favorably upon Taiwan as an
applicant to the visa waiver program.</P>
      <P>"People-to-people  exchange is a critical component of our relationship",  said
Young, adding that many of the Taiwanese government leaders he works with,
including President Ma Ying-jeou, obtained their degrees in the U.S.</P>
      <P>According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, there are now 36,000
students from Taiwan in the U.S., making Taiwan second only to South Korea
worldwide in the terms of the portion of its overall population studying in the
U.S.</P>
      <P>Young said that the he is glad to see that the number of Taiwanese students in
the U.S. remains strong.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, he said there has been a drop in applications by Taiwanese
citizens for visitor visas to the United States, a trend he blames on the
current weak economic climate.</P>
      <P>Young assumed duties as director of the Taipei Office of the American Institute
in Taiwan on March 18, 2006.</P>
      <P>The AIT serves as the representative office of the United States in Taiwan.
Washington's establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of
China in 1979 required termination of its diplomatic relations with the Republic
of China. However, the AIT serves to assist and protect U.S. interests in Taiwan
in a non-official manner.</P>

      <P>The first Cabinet-sponsored foreigner assistance center is expected to open soon
in the northern city of Hsinchu to provide services to foreigners visiting or
staying in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Hsinchu Foreigner Assistance Center, to be located at No. 107 Zhong Yang
Road in Hsinchu City, will be a consultancy office dedicated to helping
foreigners solve problems they encounter in Taiwan, Hsinchu Mayor Lin Junq-tzer
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The center has already begun offering assistance to foreigners since a soft
opening several days ago, Lin said, adding that consultants in the center
include professional consultants and young men serving alternative military
service who speak fluent English or Japanese.</P>
      <P>After learning that similar foreigner assistance centers have been established
in major Asian countries, such as Japan, Singapore and South Korea, Lin said,
the Cabinet-level Research, Development and Evaluation Commission recently
decided to establish one in Taiwan. Hsinchu City was chosen to host the first
center of this kind in the country.</P>
      <P>Hsinchu is home to Taiwan's "Silicon Valley, " -- the Hsinchu Science  Park --
which is the country's  first  and largest science-based industrial park. As a
result, the city attracts a lot of foreign visitors.</P>
      <P>In the future, said Lin, students of Hsinchu's prestigious National Tsinghua
University will be selected to work as volunteers at the center.</P>
      <P>Consultancy services the Hsinchu Foreigner Assistance Center will be offering
include help in getting settled in Taiwan, planning travel itineraries, doing
business and investing, finding housing and obtaining medicare and medical
information, as well as transportation information, Lin added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's decision to nix the idea of a visit to Taiwan at this
time by the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama was based on concern for
Taiwan's overall interests, but "such a visit could be arranged at a proper time
in the future," Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The president is concerned about the situation in Tibet, but his rejection of a
possible visit by the Dalai Lama at present was based on consideration of the
nation's overall interests, " Wang said while taking questions from the press at
the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>However,  Wang sidestepped a question on whether the term "national interests"
refers to cross-Taiwan Strait relations, saying that "this is a complex issue."</P>
      <P>He also stressed that Beijing has not contacted the Taiwan government on the
Dalai Lama issue.</P>
      <P>Although the Dalai Lama has publicly expressed interest in visiting Taiwan for a
third time, sources said, the Tibetan spiritual leader has not applied to the
Taiwan government to do so.</P>
      <P>President Ma said during a news conference with members of the Taiwan Foreign
Correspondents' Club Wednesday that Taiwan welcomes visits by all the world's
religious leaders, but added, "I think at the current moment, the timing is not
appropriate" for a visit by the Dalai Lama.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions from reporters on the matter Thursday at the Legislative
Yuan, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng suggested President Ma reconsider
his position, as a visit by the Dalai Lama, widely viewed as the world's most
admirable religious leader, would be religious in nature.</P>
      <P>"It is not necessary to look a visit by the Dalai Lama from a political
viewpoint," Wang said. "Taiwan could permit him to visit in a way that would
make the world take positive notice of Taiwan, without upsetting the improving
cross-strait ties."</P>
      <P>Later Thursday, opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) spokesman Cheng
Wen-tsang expressed regret over the president's negative position on a possible
visit by the Dalai Lama at this time.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the president should provide the public with a clear explanation of
his stance on the issue, arguing that Taiwan should never give way to pressure
from Beijing as this would tarnish Taiwan's international image.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at the Legislative Yuan, members of the DPP
legislative caucus urged the president to review his stance, adding that they
would propose a motion in the legislature to welcome a visit by the Dalai Lama
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma's position on the Dalai Lama issue has not only hurt the Taiwan people's
feelings, but will also create a misconception of Taiwan internationally, DPP
lawmakers said.</P>
      <P>DPP  Legislator  Huang  Wei-cher  questioned  why  the  Ma administration had so
eagerly welcomed a visit by Chen Yunlin, but was turning a cold shoulder to the
Tibetan spiritual leader.</P>
      <P>Chen, who serves as Beijing's top negotiator with Taiwan, held talks with his
Taiwanese counterpart in November in Taipei amid warming ties between Taiwan and
China since Ma came to power in May.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Thursday that the opening of Taiwan's universities
to Chinese students will be carried out in a gradual manner and with caution.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks after the Cabinet approved a package of draft amendments to
the University Act, the Junior College Act, and the Statute Governing Relations
Between the Peoples of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area to facilitate its
plan to allow Chinese students to attend universities in Taiwan and to recognize
education credentials from Chinese universities.</P>
      <P>Liu directed the Ministry of Education (MOE) to observe the principle of
"gradual opening with complimentary measures" in its implementation of the
policy.</P>
      <P>The draft amendments will now be sent to the Legislative Yuan for review.</P>
      <P>Under the amended laws, Taiwan will only recognize diplomas issued by reputable
Chinese universities, will set a quota for the number of Chinese students coming
to Taiwan, and in the initial stage will not recognize medical school
credentials, even from reputable Chinese universities.</P>
      <P>There will be specific admission quota for Chinese students applying to Taiwan
schools, which will be set apart from the quota for local students, so that the
rights of Taiwanese students pursuing higher education will not be affected,
according to the plan.</P>
      <P>Chinese students will not be awarded scholarships by Taiwanese universities,
will not be allowed to work in Taiwan, must leave Taiwan after completion or
termination of their studies, and will not be allowed to take Taiwan's civil
service exams for government jobs, the regulations stipulate.</P>
      <P>Ho Cho-fei, director of the MOE's Department of Higher Learning, said that the
number of Chinese students to be admitted will range between 0.5 percent and 1
percent of the total number of new students enrolled in domestic colleges and
universities, or between 1,000 and 2,000.</P>
      <P>"The MOE will temporarily let each college and university decide individually on
the tuition fees for Chinese students," Ho added.</P>
      <P>An estimated 7,000 Taiwanese students are studying in China, and some 240,000
Chinese nationals have married into Taiwanese families. When these Taiwanese
students and Chinese spouses look for employment in Taiwan, they face the
problem of employers not recognizing their education credentials, thus depriving
them of equal opportunities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP to push for reform of detention system: chairwoman</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) passed a resolution Wednesday
supporting its legislators to push for reform of Taiwan's detention system in
light of the fact that a number of suspects, including current or former DPP
members, have been detained without trial.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen made the announcement at a news conference after a
DPP weekly Central Standing Committee meeting.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that DPP lawmakers will propose amendments to relevant laws at the
Legislative Yuan aimed at improving protection of detainees' human rights.</P>
      <P>Describing the Ministry of Justice as a "human rights killer, " for its role in
several recent cases involving the ill-treatment of detainees, Tsai said all
public officials involved should resign to take responsibility for violating
human rights during investigations.</P>
      <P>Among the most notorious of such practices are those pertaining to forcing
detainees to have a short crew-cut and handcuffing them before trial, Tsai cited
as examples.</P>
      <P>In the most high-profile example, ex-president and former DPP chairman Chen
Shui-bian was led away in handcuffs on Nov. 12 and remains in detention without
being formally charged, pending an investigation into alleged corruption and
money laundering by the former first family.</P>
      <P>Tsai on Thursday also lambasted  Minister of Justice Wang Ching-feng for
interfering in legal cases and publicly discussing the content of legal cases on
TV talk shows.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, she accused the ministry of taking steps against Cheng Wen-long, the
lawyer for former president Chen, under the pretext that he allegedly leaked
information about the case to the press.</P>
      <P>The ministry recently sent a request to the Taipei District Prosecutors Office
and the Taiwan Lawyers Association asking them to investigate Cheng and see
whether he should have his license revoked.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the ministry's move has already generated a profound chilling
effect among local attorneys and is a giant step backwards for human rights.</P>
      <P>She added that the ministry's actions reminded her of the Formosa Incident in
1979 when defense lawyers were subjected to intimidation by the authorities.</P>
      <P>The DPP chairwoman said that President Ma Ying-jeou has stated publicly several
times that he had never intervened in any legal case when he was minister of
justice, but he seemed to forget that he, as head of state, should take full
responsibility for the inadequacy of the country's legal system and human rights
violations.</P>
      <P>"Up until now, the president or the ministry have not come up with any idea or
proposal for relevant law amendments," Tsai added.</P>
      <P>She suggested that the president should first review the criminal procedure
system and modify regulations  on the treatment of detainees, such as banning
the use of precautionary appliances, such as handcuffs, in order to avoid human
rights infringements.</P>
      <P>Tsai also called on Ma to conduct a public investigation into clashes between
police and protesters during the visit of Chinese negotiator Chen Yunlin to
Taipei early last month, to determine whether law enforcement authorities
infringed on protesters' freedom of expression and personal safety.</P>
      <P>She said Ma should not dodge his responsibility over the issue, rather he should
consider a proposal by the U.S. Freedom House to create an independent
commission to thoroughly look into the matter.</P>

      <P>The United States is urging Taiwan to adopt internationally consistent standards
as quickly as possible in its development of food regulatory systems, American
Institute in Taiwan Director Stephen M. Young said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Young made the remarks during a speech titled "U.S. Taiwan Relations: Looking To
The Future, Building On Past Achievements," at a luncheon hosted by the American
Chamber of Commerce in Taiwan at the Grand Formosa Regent Taipei.</P>
      <P>Noting that the overall value of U.S. agricultural exports to Taiwan has
continued to grow for the sixth consecutive year, Young said, however, "the
agricultural market access problems remain at the heart of our trade agenda."</P>
      <P>He said that there are still major challenges ahead for the further opening of
Taiwan's market to key U.S. agricultural products.</P>
      <P>Nearly three years ago, Taiwan led Asia in re-opening its market to imports of
U.S. boneless beef, and since then Taiwanese consumers have welcomed U.S. beef,
buying US$107 million worth in 2007 alone, said Young.</P>
      <P>However, he added, despite ample scientific evidence that the imports of U.S.
"bone-in" beef pose no safety risk, they continue to be banned in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese consumers are confident that U.S. beef is safe", Young stated.</P>
      <P>Calling for Taiwan to fully open its market to U.S. beef, Young reminded Taiwan
that the transparent application of scientific principles consistent with
established international norms is the best way to ensure food safety while
facilitating trade.</P>
      <P>"As Taiwan seeks to expand its role in the global community, it should also live
up to its responsibilities as a member of that community," he advised.</P>
      <P>He said that the U.S. understands that the Department of Health of Taiwan (DOH)
will soon publish the findings of its risk assessments on the safety of U.S.
beef products, adding that he hopes the results will bring the U.S. closer to
the early, science-based opening of the market to the full range of U.S. beef
products.</P>
      <P>Taiwan banned U.S. beef in 2003 when a case of "bovine spongiform
encephalopathy"(BSE), better known as mad cow disease, was diagnosed in Seattle.
The ban was lifted in April 2005 to allow imports of U.S. de-boned beef from
cattle under 30 months old, but the Taiwan government re-imposed the ban two
months later when a second BSE case was discovered in the United States. The DOH
didn't lift the ban until Jan.25, 2006.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently only allows the import of U.S. boneless beef from cattle
younger than 30 months, produced from certificated slaughterhouses and without
high risk parts such as brains and spinal cord marrow.</P>

      <P>A group of young Taiwanese men will be dispatched  in mid-December  to countries
that have diplomatic relations with Taiwan to provide technical and medical
assistance, as an alternative to mandatory military service, the government-
funded International Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Javier C. S. Hou said that while this valuable
experience will "allow young Taiwanese to broaden their horizons," it is also a
way to "contribute to the more balanced development of the world."</P>
      <P>Hou encouraged the young men to give their best in assisting Taiwan's allies,
because "although you are called military men, you are regarded as experts by
the developing countries with which Taiwan has ties."</P>
      <P>According to the ICDF, 94 servicemen, after completing eight weeks of extended
training in areas such as professional skills, language courses and adjustment
to foreign cultures, will depart for Taiwan's 22 diplomatic allies in the Asia-
Pacific, Africa, the Caribbean, and Central and South America.</P>
      <P>The conscripts, who are in their mid-20's, will join Taiwan's overseas medical
missions or technical teams currently operating in counties with diplomatic ties
to Taiwan, providing assistance in areas that include agriculture, aquatic
product cultivation, public health and information technology, according to the
ICDF.</P>
      <P>The ICDF, mandated by Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs to facilitate aid to
Taiwan's allies and other nations, began recruiting servicemen for overseas work
in 2001. Over the past seven years, the number of participants in the program
has grown to 425. After completing their overseas assignments, many servicemen
usually chose to join the ICDF's teams abroad as a career.</P>
      <P>The youth overseas service initiative provides an alternative option for young
Taiwanese males, who are required to serve for 14 months in the military, to
meet their obligations while making use of their professional skills and helping
to improve the living standards in Taiwan's allies. The period of alternative
service is two months longer than the regular conscription.</P>

      <P>A pair of giant pandas which China has promised to give to Taiwan is expected to
be delivered to Taipei prior to Christmas Day, a ranking official of the
intermediary body Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Kao Koong-lian, vice chairman and secretary-general of the quasi-official SEF,
expressed hopes at the Legislative Yuan that the two pandas could be delivered
days before Christmas to facilitate the rare animals' public display at the
Taipei Zoo during the Lunar New Year holidays, which begin on Jan. 25.</P>
      <P>"Taipei Zoo would be in a rush should the pandas arrive by Christmas or later, "
Kao said.</P>
      <P>He explained that it would take one month for the animals to undergo quarantine
observation after arriving in Taiwan before they could be presented to zoo
visitors.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kao said, the 17 seedlings of the Chinese endemic dove tree that
China has also promised to give to Taiwan as a token of peace across the Taiwan
Strait are expected to be delivered along with the pandas.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Bureau of Foreign Trade under the Ministry of Economic Affairs
has already referred import-export documents to relevant Chinese authorities for
the animals and the seedlings, and that delivery could proceed as long as
Chinese authorities return the documents.</P>
      <P>The dove tree usually lives for 50-150 years and is known as a "living fossil"
because it is believed to have survived the Ice Age.</P>
      <P>The species is called dove tree by the Chinese because its flowers look like
white doves. It was named Davidia Involucrata in the West in honor of Pierre
Armand David, a French missionary and explorer who found wild dove trees in
Muping of Sichuan, China in 1903.</P>
      <P>The dove tree, which has been declared by Beijing as one of China's eight rare
and endangered fauna species, is also called the "pearls of the forests" in
China. Most of the wild dove tree forests are found in China's Sichuan, Hubei,
Guizhou, Gansu and Yunnan provinces.</P>
      <P>China's top negotiator with Taiwan, Chen Yunlin, president of the Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) , and his Taiwanese counterpart,
SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung, agreed in Taipei during Chen's visit to Taipei
last month that the two sides present each other with rare indigenous species of
fauna and flora as tokens of friendship and amity.</P>
      <P>Under that agreement, Taiwan will reciprocate with a pair of Formosan serow - a
type of goat - and a pair of Formosan sika deer.</P>
      <P>Chen and Chiang also signed pacts on food safety, the expansion of cross-strait

      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung left for Japan
Thursday to explain the recent developments in Taiwan-China ties to Japanese
figures and arrange a visit by ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung to
that country.</P>
      <P>Speaking to reporters at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport prior to his
departure, Chiang said he will meet representatives from Japan's political and
media circles and from local expatriate communities to provide them with
comprehensive information concerning recent changes in cross-Taiwan Strait
relations.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, he will help arrange the itinerary for Wu, who is slated
to visit Japan next week.</P>
      <P>Japan has been a long time and close ally of Taiwan in the region.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-China ties have significantly improved after President Ma Ying-jeou
assumed office in May, and a visit to Taipei last month by Chen Yunlin, China's
top negotiator with Taiwan, also gave a further boost to bilateral ties, the SEF
chief said.</P>

not jeopardize its relations with other countries, but rather benefit the region
by promoting peace and stability.</P>
      <P>In a follow-up to their historic encounter in June in Beijing, Chiang and Chen
inked four agreements during their meeting in Taipei last month.</P>
      <P>The agreements, which are slated to take effect from Dec. 15, will expand direct

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou expressed the hope Thursday that European countries will
waive visa requirements for Taiwanese tourists.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that Taiwan has given more than 30 countries, including 20 European
Union nations, visa-free treatment. If the European countries could also
reciprocate, then the number of Taiwan tourists to Europe will definitely
increase dramatically, he added.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he received foreign participants to the 25th
Taiwan-European Conference, an annual academic meeting sponsored by National
Chengchi University's Institute of International Relations.</P>
      <P>Ma said the conference has played a major role in increasing academic exchanges
between Taiwan and European countries over the past 25 years. He added that it
has also contributed to the progress made in relations between Taiwan and many
European countries.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that the European Union is now Taiwan's fourth largest trading partner.</P>
      <P>The EU has been supportive of Taiwan in many ways, including its support of the
second round of talks between Taiwan and China in Taipei last month and of
Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Organization and its governing body, the
World Health Assembly, Ma said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH urges dentists to exercise self-discipline over implant quality</HEADLINE>

      <P>Self-discipline on the part of dentists who supply dental implants might be the
only defense against substandard implant quality, as the government has no
effective quality control mechanism in this area, Department of Health (DOH)
official Chou Tao-chun said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chou, a section chief of the DOH's Bureau of Medical Affairs, said that while
dentists are allowed to perform the procedure, there is no system to guarantee
their competence.</P>
      <P>He urged patients to check whether their dentists have received certifications
from professional  groups before getting dental implants.</P>
      <P>Wang Kang-yu, a Taipei Citizen, told CNA that same day that he contracted
periodontal disease that he said stemmed from substandard dental implants that
he received a decade ago.</P>
      <P>Wang's current dentist, Chen Liang-chou, who treated Wang's dental problems,
said substandard tooth implants can indeed cause dental problems that without
treatment could lead to the loss of the implants.</P>
      <P>Tsai Yi-min,  an executive  of Taiwan's  Academy  of Oral Implantology (AOI) ,
said Taiwanese customers buy around 100,000 dental implants every year, but
added that most local dentistry schools do not provide enough training in the
procedure.</P>
      <P>Those who want to perfect their technique have to seek training on their own,
for which many travel abroad, but even overseas training can be hasty and is no
guarantee of quality, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>In addition to the uneven standards among dentists, the market is also chaotic
in terms of price levels for both materials and procedures, with the price of a
complete dental implant ranging from NT$30,000 (US$895)-NT$100,000, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Another health official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Taiwan has
about 15,000 practicing dentists, only about 1,000 of whom are members of either
the AOI or the only other professional organization in the field, the
International Congress of Oral Implantology in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>An AOI executive pointed out that only about 140 of the academy's members have
been granted dental implant certification by the academy, a process in which
members apply to receive evaluation from the academy. The evaluation process,
which takes about two years, is considered proof that a member has outstanding
dental implant skills.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet approved Thursday a set of regulatory measures to pave the way for
the opening of Taiwan's securities  and  commodities  markets  to  qualified
domestic institutional investors (QDII) from China.</P>
      <P>The measures will take effect on the date of their proclamation by the Financial
Supervisory  Commission (FSC) ,  Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said during a Cabinet
meeting, adding that the opening is expected to attract more overseas investment
to Taiwan and help expand the size of the country's capital market.</P>
      <P>The move will also speed up Taiwan's internationalization and enhance its
competitiveness, elements that are essential to the government's bid to
transform the country into a regional financial hub, Liu said.</P>
      <P>According to the regulations,  Chinese QDII funds will be permitted to invest up
to 3 percent of their capital in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>With such funds having experienced significant shrinkage owing to the global
financial crisis,  FSC Vice Chairwoman Lee Jih-chu estimated that the 3 percent
ratio will mean an amount of just US$200 million, down sharply from the US$1.1
billion estimated in August.</P>
      <P>The regulations stipulate that QDII investors will be forbidden from investing
in Taiwan's over-the-counter market and from engaging in margin trading.</P>
      <P>They also impose restrictions that will prevent investors from taking control of
the Taiwanese businesses in which they invest, so that they will not be allowed
to become board directors  or supervisors of Taiwanese businesses or to
influence the personnel decisions of such businesses.</P>

      <P>There is a strong likelihood that Taiwan and China will sign a memorandum of
understanding (MOU) during the first quarter of next year to facilitate
cooperation in the area of banking supervision, according to a local banker.</P>
      <P>Susan S. Chang, chairwoman of the Bank of Taiwan (BOT), made the comments at a
news conference Wednesday after her return from Beijing where she attended an
academic symposium on cross-Taiwan Strait financial cooperation.</P>
      <P>Chang said that during the symposium she discussed with Chinese banking
officials the possibility of Taiwan and China signing an MOU, which they believe
would impact positively on bilateral banking cooperation.</P>
      <P>The MOU would also make it possible to upgrade the seven liaison offices
established by Taiwanese banks in China to bank branches, she added.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, four Chinese banks have been permitted by China's Banking
Regulatory Commission to set up footholds in Taiwan. However, as Taiwan has not
yet revised its law to permit such opening, none of the banks have been able to
establish operations here, she added.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese citizens are prohibited by the Republic of China government from
taking up any public post in China that is political in nature, the Cabinet-
level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>MAC spokesman and Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun said Taiwanese citizens are not
allowed to be Chinese Peoples Political Consultative COnference (CPPCC) members,
regardless of whether the position is at the city-based CPPCC committee or
national level, according to the Statute Governing the Relations Between the
People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks in response to a news report from China's Fujian Province
that day that Xiamen City has passed an amendment recently allowing Taiwanese
residents to be elected members of the city committee of the CPPCC as part of
the city government's efforts to "protect Taiwan residents' investments in
Xiamen."</P>
      <P>Liu said that although admission to the CPPCC as a delegate would be conducive
to solving the problems facing Taiwanese businessmen operating in China, he
urged China-based Taiwanese businessmen not to challenge Taiwan's laws.</P>
      <P>According to the Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of the
Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, Taiwanese citizens or organizations are
prohibited from joining or taking posts in political, military or administrative
groups or organizations in China.</P>
      <P>In May this year, representatives of several associations of Taiwanese
businessmen in China called for President Ma Ying-jeou's administration to
earmark money to establish a "taishang fund" in China to financially assist
Taiwanese businessmen, who face constant difficulties operating in the "factory
of the world."</P>
      <P>One of the representatives also urged the administration to seek to revise the
Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the
Mainland Area so that China-based Taiwanese businessmen can be elected as
members of CPPCC committees.</P>
      <P>Since most Taiwanese businessmen living in China run businesses there, admission
to the CPPCC as delegates would allow their voices to be better heard and would
give them a platform for communication with the local and central Chinese
governments, the representative said.</P>

      <P>The United States will maintain a consistent policy regarding its relations with
Taiwan under the incoming administration of U.S.  President-elect Barack Obama,
American Institute in Taiwan Director Stephen M. Young said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Young, head of the de facto U.S. embassy in Taipei in the absence of diplomatic
relations between the two countries, made the remarks in a speech titled "U.S.
Taiwan Relations: Looking To The Future, Building On Past Achievements, " at a
luncheon hosted by the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Young said he is confident the "consistency" that has served both countries so
well in the past will continue as the U.S. prepares for the transition to a new
administration.</P>
      <P>He also revealed that influential cross-Taiwan Strait affairs experts such as
James Steinburg, Richard Bush and Jeff Bader might be appointed to senior
positions in the Obama Administration, a possibility that he described as
"favorable to Taiwan's interests."</P>
      <P>"The global environment has seen dramatic changes in the past three decades, "
said Young, adding that despite those changes, the United States has maintained
a remarkably consistent policy regarding its relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Explaining  how U.S.  policy  has contributed  to Taiwan's development, Young
said that "it is precisely this consistency that has helped form the basis for
the extraordinary political and economic progress now enjoyed by everyone in
Taiwan, a progress that can serve as an example to all who seek to build a
society that combines prosperity and freedom."</P>
      <P>Asked about the four agreements signed between Taiwan and China in the past six
months to enhance cross-strait economic links, Young described them as the "low
hanging fruits" of the development of cross-strait economic relations.</P>
      <P>He said that although the immediate economic benefits of the recent cross-strait
opening might not always be apparent, each incremental step in an ongoing
process will help build a climate that favors investment and growth.</P>
      <P>"The United States welcomes increased economic and trade ties between China and
Taiwan, " Young reiterated, adding that enhanced cross-strait economic links
"are just plain good for business, especially at a time of global economic
uncertainty."</P>

      <P>Tourism and shipping operators on outlying Matsu Island voiced concern Thursday
over the opening of direct air links between Taiwan proper and Fuzhou in China's
Fujian Province, which they said could seriously impact their livelihoods.</P>
      <P>The operators took the issue to the island's Lienchiang County Government
Transport Bureau after Chinese media reported recently that a one-way charter
flight between Taipei and Fuzhou, to be operated by China's Xiamen Airlines,
will cost 680 yuan (US$99).</P>
      <P>The fare will be lower than a one-way ferry trip between the two destinations --
currently priced at 700 yuan -- according to the Chinese media report. The price
will also be cheaper than the NT$3,800 for travel between Taiwan and Fuzhou via
Matsu -- commonly known as the "mini links, " according to the Chinese media
report.</P>
      <P>In that case, the existing Matsu-Fuzhou ferry business will be seriously
impacted because a direct Taipei-Fuzhou flight can also save at least three
hours in travel time compared to sailing via the "mini links," tourism operators
said.</P>
      <P>County officials refused to comment on the concerns, however, saying that the
Legislative Yuan has yet to approve accords inked last month between Taiwan and
China on expanding the two-way air travel network and opening shipping services.</P>
      <P>The "mini links" also include ferry services between Taiwan-held Kinmen Island
and the Fujian ports of Xiamen and Quanzhou since January 2001.</P>

      <P>The Maokong Gondola is being given a complete safety examination and the Taipei
city government will allow it to resume operation only after its safety has been
absolutely assured, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hau made the announcement after Taipei City Councilor Chuang Jui-hsiung of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party said earlier in the day that a gap had
been found between the ground and the base of the cable car system's support
tower T-20.</P>
      <P>In response to Sheng Chi-tseng, vice general manager of the Taipei Rapid Transit
Corp. that operates the system, who said the gap was caused when heavy rain
washed away the topsoil around the tower, the city's New Construction Office
Director-General Wu Chun-hsien said the interstice can simply be filled with
more topsoil and will not affect the tower's safety.</P>
      <P>Sheng also said the cable car system's 25 support towers have all been fitted
with tilt panels to monitor any changes in their positions and that so far, the
monitoring results appear normal.</P>
      <P>The gondola, a popular tourist attraction in the mountains of Taipei's Muzha
area, was closed indefinitely Oct. 1 out of concern that tower T-16 could
collapse during an earthquake after torrential rain brought by Typhoon Jangmei
in September eroded the base of the tower, leaving it bare and exposed.</P>
      <P>Hau said the complete overall examination includes installing the tilting panels
and checking whether all construction steps were carried out according to the
design brief.</P>
      <P>Each support tower will be assessed by experts to ensure its safety, Hau
continued, adding that the city government has no timetable or cost estimate for
the examination.</P>
      <P>The mayor announced earlier in the week that the city government had begun the
process of selecting a site for the possible relocation of tower T-16.</P>
      <P>An initial  safety  assessment  filed by four major civil engineering
associations last Sunday strongly recommended that the tower be relocated and
that the entire slope in the vicinity of the pillar be reinforced to make the
system safe.</P>
      <P>Hau said Poma Co.,  the system's French manufacturer  and installer, will send
technicians to Taiwan if necessary and that city government staff are in
discussions about the types of machines and cranes that will be needed for a
relocation effort.</P>

      <P>The head of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) is slated to arrive
in Taipei Friday to officiate at an opening reception for a branch office in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>HKTDC Chairman Jack So will be accompanied by other senior executives of the
trade promotion organization, the council's Taipei representative, Perry Fung,
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Fung, who has been in Taipei since October preparing for the opening of the
council's first foothold here, said the HKTDC Taiwan office will begin formal
operations early next year.</P>
      <P>The HKTDC,  a Hong Kong  government-funded  but unofficial organization, began
considering opening a branch in Taiwan five years ago, but did not file an
application until after the Kuomintang -- seen as more friendly toward China
than the previous Democratic Progressive Party administration -- regained power
in Taiwan in May this year.</P>
      <P>After Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs approved the HKTDC application in
October, the Hong Kong group sent Fung -- formerly the HKTDC Beijing office's
top executive in charge of the northern China market -- to Taipei to prepare for
the opening of the new office.</P>
      <P>The government has warmly welcomed the HKTDC's decision to establish a foothold
in Taipei as it will facilitate bilateral trade and civic exchanges.</P>
      <P>Wang Chih-kang, chairman of the quasi-official Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA) , said he believes the opening of the HKTDC branch office will
lead to more bilateral cooperation projects in various fields.</P>
      <P>The HKTDC is governed by a 19-member council of Hong Kong business leaders and
senior government officials. It plans and supervises the HKTDC's global
operations, services and promotional activities, and also oversees the running
of the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong is Taiwan's fourth- largest trading partner after China, Japan and the
United States.</P>
      <P>According to customs statistics, Taiwan-Hong Kong trade totaled US$39.8 billion
in 2007, accounting for 8.54 percent of Taiwan's overall foreign trade for the
year. Of that amount, Taiwan's exports accounted for US$37.98 billion, or 15.4
percent of the country's total exports for the year, making Hong Kong Taiwan's
second-largest export outlet after China.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Hong Kong invested more than US$200 million in Taiwan, up 76
percent from 2006, while Taiwan's investment in Hong Kong for that year totaled
about US$190 million.</P>
      <P>In the first six months of this year, Hong Kong investment had already topped
US$236 million, far exceeding its investment for the whole of 2007, according to
official Taiwan government tallies.</P>

      <P>Airfares for northbound flights on direct cross-Taiwan Strait charter planes
will be cut by an average of 10 percent after such services are expanded to a
daily basis, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>CAA Director-General Lee Lung-wen made the remarks in response to recent appeals
by the Consumers Foundation which said ticket prices  for direct  cross-strait

weekend basis.</P>
      <P>Noting that the foundation's appeal is plausible, Lee said the CAA has persuaded
five locally owned air carriers to adjust downward their cross-strait ticket
prices.</P>
      <P>"All of the five carriers have given a positive response to our push, " Lee
said, adding that China Airlines, Mandarin Airlines, EVA Airways and UNI Airways
have promised to lower airfares on northbound cross-strait flights by an average
of 10 percent, while Trans Asia Airways  will cut prices for one-way  tickets
by NT$500 to NT$600.</P>

      <P>Hau made the announcement after Taipei City Councilor Chuang Jui-hsiung of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party said earlier in the day that a gap had
been found between the ground and the base of the cable car system's support
tower T-20.</P>
      <P>In response to Sheng Chi-tseng, vice general manager of the Taipei Rapid Transit
Corp. that operates the system, who said the gap was caused when heavy rain
washed away the topsoil around the tower, the city's New Construction Office
Director-General Wu Chun-hsien said the interstice can simply be filled with
more topsoil and will not affect the tower's safety.</P>
      <P>Sheng also said the cable car system's 25 support towers have all been fitted
with tilt panels to monitor any changes in their positions and that so far, the
monitoring results appear normal.</P>
      <P>The gondola, a popular tourist attraction in the mountains of Taipei's Muzha
area, was closed indefinitely Oct. 1 out of concern that tower T-16 could
collapse during an earthquake after torrential rain brought by Typhoon Jangmei
in September eroded the base of the tower, leaving it bare and exposed.</P>
      <P>Hau said the complete overall examination includes installing the tilting panels
and checking whether all construction steps were carried out according to the
design brief.</P>
      <P>Each support tower will be assessed by experts to ensure its safety, Hau
continued, adding that the city government has no timetable or cost estimate for
the examination.</P>
      <P>The mayor announced earlier in the week that the city government had begun the
process of selecting a site for the possible relocation of tower T-16.</P>
      <P>An initial  safety  assessment  filed by four major civil engineering
associations last Sunday strongly recommended that the tower be relocated and
that the entire slope in the vicinity of the pillar be reinforced to make the
system safe.</P>
      <P>Hau said Poma Co.,  the system's French manufacturer  and installer, will send
technicians to Taiwan if necessary and that city government staff are in
discussions about the types of machines and cranes that will be needed for a
relocation effort.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HKTDC chief to preside over opening of Taiwan branch office</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 4 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) is slated to arrive
in Taipei Friday to officiate at an opening reception for a branch office in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>HKTDC Chairman Jack So will be accompanied by other senior executives of the
trade promotion organization, the council's Taipei representative, Perry Fung,
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Fung, who has been in Taipei since October preparing for the opening of the
council's first foothold here, said the HKTDC Taiwan office will begin formal
operations early next year.</P>
      <P>The HKTDC,  a Hong Kong  government-funded  but unofficial organization, began
considering opening a branch in Taiwan five years ago, but did not file an
application until after the Kuomintang -- seen as more friendly toward China
than the previous Democratic Progressive Party administration -- regained power
in Taiwan in May this year.</P>
      <P>After Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs approved the HKTDC application in
October, the Hong Kong group sent Fung -- formerly the HKTDC Beijing office's
top executive in charge of the northern China market -- to Taipei to prepare for
the opening of the new office.</P>
      <P>The government has warmly welcomed the HKTDC's decision to establish a foothold
in Taipei as it will facilitate bilateral trade and civic exchanges.</P>
      <P>Wang Chih-kang, chairman of the quasi-official Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA) , said he believes the opening of the HKTDC branch office will
lead to more bilateral cooperation projects in various fields.</P>
      <P>The HKTDC is governed by a 19-member council of Hong Kong business leaders and
senior government officials. It plans and supervises the HKTDC's global
operations, services and promotional activities, and also oversees the running
of the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong is Taiwan's fourth- largest trading partner after China, Japan and the
United States.</P>
      <P>According to customs statistics, Taiwan-Hong Kong trade totaled US$39.8 billion
in 2007, accounting for 8.54 percent of Taiwan's overall foreign trade for the
year. Of that amount, Taiwan's exports accounted for US$37.98 billion, or 15.4
percent of the country's total exports for the year, making Hong Kong Taiwan's
second-largest export outlet after China.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Hong Kong invested more than US$200 million in Taiwan, up 76
percent from 2006, while Taiwan's investment in Hong Kong for that year totaled
about US$190 million.</P>
      <P>In the first six months of this year, Hong Kong investment had already topped
US$236 million, far exceeding its investment for the whole of 2007, according to
official Taiwan government tallies.</P>

      <P>Airfares for northbound flights on direct cross-Taiwan Strait charter planes
will be cut by an average of 10 percent after such services are expanded to a
daily basis, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>CAA Director-General Lee Lung-wen made the remarks in response to recent appeals
by the Consumers Foundation which said ticket prices  for direct  cross-strait
charter  flights  should  be lowered  to reflect  the  shortened  flight  time
once  such services  are  expanded  to  a  daily  basis  from  the current
weekend basis.</P>
      <P>Noting that the foundation's appeal is plausible, Lee said the CAA has persuaded
five locally owned air carriers to adjust downward their cross-strait ticket
prices.</P>
      <P>"All of the five carriers have given a positive response to our push, " Lee
said, adding that China Airlines, Mandarin Airlines, EVA Airways and UNI Airways
have promised to lower airfares on northbound cross-strait flights by an average
of 10 percent, while Trans Asia Airways  will cut prices for one-way  tickets
by NT$500 to NT$600.</P>

Motse's lesson of the day: "When the administration of the ruler answers to the

disapprovals of the people. When there is such an understanding, the good will
be discovered and rewarded and the bad will be discovered and punished, and the
country will surely attain order."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>ROC military to be fully volunteer force by 2014</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) has started planning to push a fully
professional voluntary military service system in a bid to build the country's
military into "lean and mean" fighting force, Vice Defense Minister Chang Liang-
jen said Friday.</P>
      <P>The fully volunteer military program will be promoted in a gradual manner, with
the number of uniformed men and women recruited through a voluntary  enlistment
system increasing  10 percent year-on-year from 2010 and eventually reaching a
fully volunteer force by 2014, Chang said during a forum held in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Speaking  at the forum on a volunteer  military  and the transformation of the
armed forces that was sponsored by the Institute of International Relations of
National Chengchi University, Chang said the government will take advantage of
the eased atmosphere across the Taiwan Strait to restructure the military to
make it a modern defense force that can help maintain peace and stability across
the Taiwan Strait on a long-term basis.</P>
      <P>Defense Minister Chen Chao-min said in August that in order to comply with the
objectives set forth in President Ma Ying-jeou's election campaign platform, the
MND has been working to launch a voluntary enlistment system in 2010 with the
goal of making the military into a fully volunteer force gradually.</P>
      <P>Ma, who took office May 20, has promoted the introduction of a fully
professional  and volunteer  military  and the continued streamlining of the
armed forces, with the ultimate goal of reducing the number of military
personnel to 200,000.</P>
      <P>After the voluntary enlistment system is in place, the president said in June,
"the military will be further streamlined and a smaller but stronger military
will be established."</P>
      <P>According to an MND budget plan, the number of military personnel will have been
reduced to a total of 275,000 by the end of this year, including 250,000 on the
regular MND payroll.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's relations with China have progressed to a stage in which the two sides
no longer deny each other, thanks to the government's efforts to improve ties
over the past six months, a Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to MAC Vice Chairman Chao Chien-min, this "mutual non-denial" stage
marks a milestone in the transition from "mutual denial" to "mutual recognition"
between the two sides. Chao made the remarks while addressing an award-
presentation ceremony for short films addressing the theme of cross-Taiwan
Strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>The change, he said, is demonstrated in the fact that Chinese officials are now
willing to recognize the official capacity of Taiwanese government officials and
to visit Taiwan's president, Chao said.</P>
      <P>This shows great differences from the past,  when Chinese officials and
academics visiting Taiwan always avoided visits to government offices and
refused any meetings with Taiwanese government officials at their offices, he
noted.</P>
      <P>In what was widely viewed as a major breakthrough, Chen Yunlin, president of the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, called on MAC
Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan at her office and met with President Ma Ying-jeou
during his historic visit to Taiwan last month.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Taiwan, Chen -- who serves as Beijing's top negotiator with
Taipei -- signed four agreements with Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation
Chairman Chiang Pin-kung on cross-strait air, shipping and postal services, and
food safety communications.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that Taiwan would extend a warm welcome to
the Dalai Lama to visit Taiwan for religious activities at an opportune time,
although he added that the timing for such a visit at the present time would not
be right.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the Dalai Lama, who has expressed an interest in making another
visit to the country at some point next year, would be welcome to visit Taiwan
because he has so many followers here.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks to visiting Italian Senator Salvo Fleres, who during a brief
meeting with Ma at the Presidential Office, asked about the prospects for a
visit to Taiwan by Tibet's exiled spiritual leader.</P>
      <P>Fleres, visiting at the head of a six-member delegation from Italy, told Ma he
has gained a better understanding over the past three days of Taiwan's political
and economic development and has discovered that the Taiwanese people not only
enjoy the fruits of democratization but also freedom of religion.</P>
      <P>Ma responded by saying that "it's true that the Republic of China is a country
where the people enjoy absolute freedom of religion and that's the reason why
all religious leaders and figures in the world are welcome to visit Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ma also called for the Italy-Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Group
established in 1994 to continue its efforts to cement bilateral ties between

      <P>The government has yet to make a final decision on the members to be included in
Taiwan's delegation to the Jan. 20 inauguration of U.S. President-elect Barack
Obama, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Henry Chen also denied a media report that the MOFA has rejected
a plan by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to name former Vice
President Annette Lu as the party's representative on the delegation.</P>
      <P>The MOFA requested Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who will lead the
delegation, to help organize the delegation a few weeks ago, but he has not
submitted a list of potential members to the ministry, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The MOFA fully respects Wang's opinion and has not expressed any views on who he
should choose, the officials went on.</P>
      <P>Chen said it would not be a problem if Lu were to join the delegation, because
her possible participation is not expected to meet any opposition from the U.S.
side.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the delegation is likely to include ruling Kuomintang
(KMT) Legislator Lin Yu-fang, co-chair of the Foreign and National  Defense
Committee;  DPP Legislator  Chai Trong-rong; Non-Partisan Solidarity Union
Legislator Lin Pin-kuan; Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin; Taoyuan Magistrate Eric
Liluan Chu; Taichung Mayor Jason Hu; and Tainan Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair. The KMT
has nominated Legislator John Chiang as the party's representative.</P>

      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) caucus Deputy Secretary- General Lo Shu-lei said Friday
at a press conference that the caucus would be happy to see former Vice
President Annette Lu of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
attend the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Barack Obama if she is invited.</P>
      <P>"Annette Lu is a very good diplomat, " said Lo. "We would be very happy to see
her going to the Obama inauguration if she is invited to do so. However, it is
entirely up to the United States to decide if they want to invite her or not. It
is their call, " she pointed out.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Wu Ching-chih noted that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
has yet to decide who will be appointed to join the Taiwanese delegation that
will attend the Jan. 20 inauguration.</P>
      <P>"The MOFA should encourage Lu to attend the inauguration, " said Wu. "Even if
China objects, we should still allow her to be part of the delegation to show
that we, Taiwanese, are non-partisan, " he added. KMT Legislator Shuai Hua-ming
echoed Wu, saying that "the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) does not have too
many talented diplomats. Lu is the only DPP figure with the prominence to attend
international events. I have no objections to her attending Obama's
inauguration."</P>
      <P>The KMT caucus remarks were prompted by reports that the DPP is planning to
recommend Lu as part of the Taiwanese delegation that will attend the
inauguration, in an effort to seek the limelight following the success of KMT
Honorary Chairman Lien Chan's trip to attend the APEC Forum in Lima, Peru as
President Ma Ying-jeou's envoy.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Ker Chien-ming had said earlier that same day that "it seems that
MOFA is trying to obstruct Lu from being part of the delegation. It is the DPP's
right to send who ever we see fit to attend Obama's inauguration. Lu is a very
appropriate candidate."</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Henry Chen responded immediately, saying that the delegation is
still in the planning stages and denying that any objections had been raised to
any DPP recommendations.</P>

(By Steve Bercic)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government has cut its electricity use by 500,000 kilowatt-
hours (kWh) thanks to measures implemented by an "energy conservation, carbon
reduction" task force established  in July,  City  Government  Secretary-General
Hau Chien-sheng said Friday.</P>
      <P>Hau, who convened the task force, said in an interview that such cost cutting
measures launched by the task force as reducing the number of elevators in use
at government buildings and encouraging staff to turn off computers, printers
and other electrical equipment when not in use has helped reduce electricity
consumption by about 4.5 percent over the last five months, translating into
savings of some NT$1.5 million (US$45,000).</P>
      <P>To realize the goals of the energy conservation plan, the task force regularly
dispatches personnel to various government offices to conduct spot checks to
verify whether the recommended electricity saving measures are being followed,
Hau said.</P>
      <P>The city council has also been working in line with the energy conservation
plan, according to Hsu Mau-sen, head of the city council's general affairs
department.</P>
      <P>Hsu said measures like turning off one of the two large air conditioners in the
city council's main hall and adjusting the temperature to 23 degrees Celsius, as
well as requiring employees to cultivate energy saving habits such as turning
off lights when not in use, has helped cut the electricity bill by hundreds of
thousands of dollars over the past year.</P>
      <P>For the month of October alone, the city council reduced electricity consumption
by 17,600 kWh, which translated into savings of about NT$40,000 on its
electricity bill, Hsu said.</P>

      <P>National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) has launched a fundraising drive in
which it has invited the public to make donations to help poor children receive
education amid the global financial downward, NTNU President Kuo Yi-hsiung said
Friday.</P>
      <P>The donations will be used to subsidize tuition, school lunches and health
insurance, according to Kuo.</P>
      <P>He urged the country's 206,963 elementary, junior and high school teachers to
support the drive.</P>
      <P>He said each teacher is encouraged to donate NT$3,600 (US$107) , which is the
equivalent value of the consumption vouchers that will be issued by the
government next January in an effort to boost consumption.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan announced in November that the government will issue
consumption vouchers to the country's citizens, with each eligible individual
receiving vouchers worth NT$3,600.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that if every teacher makes the donation, NT$745 million will be raised
-- enough to subsidize 140, 000 children from impoverished families.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the drive's launch ceremony Thursday, Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-
pyng showed his support by donating not only NT$3,600 but also a further NT$1
million to fund the drive.</P>
      <P>Wang also said he will invite legislators of different political parties to
donate.</P>
      <P>In addition, the NTNU announced a variety of other activities designed to draw
society's attention to the impact of the global financial downward on education
among the disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>The activities will include a Dec. 18 "lighting up" ceremony involving the
country's 4,000 schools at elementary and secondary levels and 300 private
sector companies.</P>
      <P>From that day onward, members of the public will be able to get free miniature
light bulbs made with recycled materials from the participating schools, which
they will be able to wear to show their concern about education for the nation's
poor children, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the NTNU will send outstanding students to remote areas to help
children with their studies during vacations, and will launch a free online
learning system and CD-ROMs to provide easier access to resources for students
who need extra assistance, he added.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung City government might not be able to introduce amphibious tourist
"duck boats" before the World Games next year, a city official said Friday.</P>
      <P>"The plan to introduce two 'duck boats' before the July 16-26 World Games next
year may run into difficulty,  " said city Transportation Bureau Director Wang
Kuo-tsai.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that his bureau has appropriated nearly NT$60 million (US$1.8
million) to introduce the boats to diversify the leisure activities for
residents of Kaohsiung, a city which features a river, sea and harbor.</P>
      <P>The bureau had originally  hoped that the boats could be introduced in June to
boost tourism during the World Games period.</P>
      <P>But he said that the plan to build two "duck boats" are not going well, meaning
it will be "very difficult to introduce them before the World Games opens July
16."</P>
      <P>Tours in the "ducks, " modeled after a World War II amphibious landing vehicle,
have been popular in Singapore and cities around the United States, including
Boston and Baltimore, which is why the city believes they will boost tourism
there.</P>
      <P>The bureau first opened a tender for the "ducks" Nov. 26, but nobody came
forward, and the bureau was forced to open a second tender Dec. 4 that will
close on Dec. 8.</P>
      <P>Transportation officials said that if the tender goes smoothly this time, the
boats will take seven months to build and additional time will be needed for
inspection.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the captain of the boat should have both bus and vessel
operating licenses, and that the "duck" should also pass the inspections
required for both ships and vehicles.</P>
      <P>The bureau intends  to buy two "duck boats, " with each accommodating 30
passengers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A single mother whose only son was killed at the age of 17 and once was obsessed
with getting revenge is now more forgiving and advises others facing similar
predicaments to "forgive others so you can spare yourself."</P>
      <P>Mrs. You from the northeastern city of Yilan, whose husband died of an illness
10 years ago and whose son was killed at a barbecue nine years ago, was
directing her message at the parents of the victim of a campus murder in 1998.</P>
      <P>With the convicted assailant, former National Tsinghua University graduate
student Hung Hsiao-huei, released Thursday after spending nearly 11 years in
jail for murdering classmate and love rival Hsu Chia-chen, You has advised Hsu's
parents to "forgive Hung to allow yourselves to live."</P>
      <P>You said she spent three years in living hell after her son was stabbed to death
by a 15-year-old  youth surnamed Yang in a free-for-all.</P>
      <P>During those years, she recalled, she was so distracted that she once dumped
rice into the toilet as she was preparing to cook it.</P>
      <P>She said she would also open the door late at night upon "hearing something
outside, " but never saw her son there. When she repeated the behavior for
weeks, relatives from her mother's side of the family took her to her mother's
home to live to prevent accidents from occurring.</P>
      <P>You also admitted that she hid knives and pesticide in her purse when appearing
in court as a witness during Yang's trial, hoping to kill him first and then
herself.</P>
      <P>In another of her obsessive acts, You bought four child-sized figures made of
resin home and changed the clothes of the four boy models every day, pretending
they were her son.</P>
      <P>None of those actions helped reduce You's thirst for revenge until one day three
years ago when a voice from within asked her, "if your son was the killer, would
you hope for forgiveness from the victim's family?"</P>
      <P>Those words awakened You like a thunderbolt. The next morning, she visited Chiu
Sung-shan, a volunteer with a victims protection association in Yilan and
directly asked Chiu, "has the boy fared well in jail?"</P>
      <P>You began writing regularly to Yang, her son's killer. She even traveled from
Yilan to the southern port city of Kaohsiung to pay him a visit in prison.</P>
      <P>When Yang asked her to hug him, You said, she broke down and wept and acceded to
Yang's request. At that moment, she said, she felt as though her son was back.</P>
      <P>Gradually, she gave the figure models away as well as all the clothes left by
her son. She also put away all photos of her deceased son while continuing to
write Yang letters.</P>
      <P>Last year, when Yang was released on parole, the young man called her, telling
her that he would look for a job to earn some money to support his family. You,
nevertheless, encouraged him to return to school.</P>
      <P>Recalling four years ago when he received a letter from You, Yang said he was
shocked to learn that the mother of his victim was visiting him.</P>
      <P>He said he was absolutely unprepared as You visited on the same day he received
the letter and was numb and speechless when he first saw her.</P>
      <P>Presently a college student, Yang said he now has two mothers to take care of,
vowing that he will take good care of You throughout his life to compensate her
for her loss.</P>

      <P>A website of Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan, the pair of giant pandas that is expected
to arrive in Taipei this month as a sign of warming ties between Taiwan and
China, was launched by the Taipei City Zoo on Friday.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Education Department Director Wu Ching-shan said at the website's
launching ceremony that the Taipei City Zoo has made all the necessary
preparations to receive the pair of endangered animals, including setting up a
website for them.</P>
      <P>"We have video links on the website for people to watch the precious
documentaries about the everyday life of giant pandas in general," said Wu. "We
hope to enhance people's understanding about these lovely creatures."</P>
      <P>The        website        address        is:

      <P>Photographs of the two animals can be seen on the website, which also includes
an introduction on the concepts and methods of animal protection. Activities
arranged by the Taipei City Zoo can also be found on the website.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Zoo Director Jason Yeh joined Wu in the website launch, with both
men each holding a panda doll in their hands.</P>
      <P>Yeh added that the giant pandas, like other wildlife, are being endangered by
humans.</P>
      <P>"Their  habitats  are being destroyed  or threatened  with destruction, " said
Yeh. "We hope to help people understand wildlife and so be able to take
appropriate actions to protect them."</P>
      <P>The Straits Exchange Foundation's (SEF)  vice chairman and secretary-general,
Kao Koong-lian, said Thursday that the pair of giant pandas which China has
promised to give to Taiwan is expected to be delivered to Taipei prior to
Christmas Day.</P>
      <P>It would take one month for the animals to undergo quarantine observation after
arriving in Taiwan before they can be presented to zoo visitors, according to
Kao.</P>
      <P>Taiwan formally agreed to accept the pandas last month during a historic visit

    <TEXT>
      <P>Powerchip Semiconductor Corp. Chairman Frank Huang has called on the government
to help the ailing DRAM (dynamic random access memory) industry survive, arguing
that it is a strategic industry in Taiwan and its survival would influence the
development of other technology sectors.</P>
      <P>Oversupply and shrinking demand due to the global economic downturn have caused
a drastic slump in DRAM prices and sent most players deep into the red.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan's DRAM industry dies, South Korea will become the world's monopoly in
the sector, a development that could have great impact on the future of high-
technology industries and a consequence the government cannot afford to neglect,
Huang, the chief of the nation's largest computer memory chipmaker warned
Thursday on the sidelines of a technology forum in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"As a result, prices of all the PC and consumer electronic products in the world
would be determined by South Korea because DRAM components are the core of all
the products," Huang explained.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and South Korea are the only two DRAM manufacturing countries in the
world, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently has four major DRAM chipmakers which have been in the red for
more than one and half years, owing NT$400 billion (US$11.6 billion) in debt at
the end of September this year.</P>
      <P>The government is mulling measures bailing out the sector for fear that leaving
it alone would trigger nationwide financial turmoil, including the possibility
of putting some 20,000 workers in the industry out of jobs.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan's electronics industry has been one of the most competitive
industrial sectors in the country, the government should take measures to save
the DRAM industry so that the competitiveness of the island's electronics and PC
industries can be maintained, he said.</P>
      <P>The survival of Taiwan's  DRAM industry will also benefit downstream companies,
Huang noted. For example, laptop maker ASUSTeK Computer Inc. has said that with
cooperative ties with local DRAM manufacturers, the company is able to cut
transport costs and enjoy the convenience of speedy product delivery and other
benefits, Huang noted.</P>
      <P>He did not specify what the government should do, but insisted something should
be done efficiently and with the lowest cost.</P>
      <P>Huang expressed hope that the government would help consolidate the strategic
partnership  among Taiwan's  Powerchip,  Rexchip Electronics Corp and Japan's
Elpida Memory Inc, and assist with the merger among Taiwan's Inotera Memories
Inc, Nanya Technology Corp and the U.S. Micron Technology Inc. to enable local
DRAM companies to become more competitive through integration and globalization.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Huang said that given the sharp depreciation of the South Korean won,
Taiwan particularly needs to take measures to salvage the DRAM industry when it
is in a disadvantaged position in a competition with South Korea, in terms of
DRAM exports.</P>
      <P>Besides DRAM production, Taiwan and South Korea are competing fiercely in TFT-
LCD panel production, according to an economic official Friday in response to
Huang's remarks.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging the importance of the DRAM industry in Taiwan, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs has formed a task force aimed at providing guidance and
assistance for the industry, said the official who spoke on condition of
anonynimity.</P>
      <P>The official said that the ministry will focus its efforts on helping DRAM
companies conduct industrial upgrade through enhancing research and development
capabilities in order to raise their competitiveness.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's railway system has inaugurated its first "green" station, which will
provide transportation services with state-of-the-art, eco-friendly design and
technologies, senior administrators said Friday.</P>
      <P>At a ceremony to celebrate the inauguration of the renovated Dalin Station in
the southern county of Chiayi, Taiwan Railways Administration Director-General
Frank Fan praised the station as a "pastiche of history and modernity."</P>
      <P>The station's old building, which was preserved in the renovation project, was
built in 1903 under Japanese colonial rule, while the new "green"  service
complex is equipped  with all kinds of eco-friendly technology.</P>
      <P>Lauding  it as "the  most  novel,  most  beautiful,  most user-friendly" station
among the 200 or so train stations in Taiwan, Fan said the complex is a
100-percent "green building" that not only fully relies on natural ventilation
and natural light, but also recycles rainwater and converts sunlight into
electricity.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Fan continued, to reduce the pollution caused by the station itself
and railway operations, the station is also equipped with noise reducing units
and air purifiers that can reduce the exhaust of diesel locomotives,</P>
      <P>In addition, the new complex also adopted the "overpass station" design that
places the service areas over the rails, both to reduce the area occupied and
allow free access from both sides of the rails.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's Legislature approves bill to issue consumption vouchers</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5 (CNA)
12/05/08  19:09:15
(By Andrew Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed a bill Friday that authorizes the government to
issue NT$3,600 (US$108)  in consumption vouchers to Taiwan's citizens in an
attempt to stimulate the country's slumping retail sector and boost the overall
economy.</P>
      <P>The plan, which will cost approximately NT$83.5 billion and boost 2009 gross
domestic product growth by 0.64 percent if all the vouchers are used, was passed
without much resistance given the ruling Kuomintang's two-thirds majority in the
lawmaking body.</P>
      <P>To finalize the voucher plan and ensure the vouchers can be distributed by the
government's target date of Jan. 18, the Cabinet must still submit a consumption
voucher budget bill -- needed to secure funding for the program -- to the
legislature by Dec. 8 at noon.</P>
      <P>The bill must then be approved by related legislative committees by Dec. 22 and
the full legislature by Dec. 26 for the program to go forward and meet the
distribution deadline.</P>
      <P>Should the budget bill be passed, as is expected, the vouchers would first be
issued on Jan. 18, a week before the Lunar New Year holiday, and then after the
holiday until March 31.</P>
      <P>The vouchers will be valid for use until Sept. 30, 2009, and retailers must
claim reimbursement for the vouchers by Oct. 31, 2009.</P>
      <P>Prior to Friday's vote on the bill's contents, the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party pushed its own alternative measure, which called for the
distribution of NT$3,800 in cash, instead of vouchers, to Taiwan's citizens.</P>
      <P>Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng called a meeting between KMT and DPP lawmakers
to try and bridge the gap between the two measures, without success.</P>
      <P>All Taiwanese citizens, with the exception of those living abroad without an
identity card, local registration or residency rights, as well as their foreign
spouses will be eligible to receive NT$3,600 in vouchers.</P>
      <P>Those  born by the end of March 2009 who have household registrations as
citizens of the Republic of China will be eligible for the program, according to
one of a set of resolutions attached to the bill.</P>
      <P>Critics of the bill have argued that the voucher program will have potentially
high administrative costs, including the cost of printing a voucher that is hard
to counterfeit.</P>
      <P>To contain these expenses, another resolution attached to the bill stipulated
that administrative costs could not exceed 3 percent of the special budget
earmarked for the program.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan proposed the last month as a way to pump money into Taiwan's
flagging retail sector. The vouchers must be used to purchase goods locally and
cannot be deposited as savings in banks or exchanged for cash.</P>
      <P>Those who donate their coupons to charity, however, will be entitled to a tax
deduction.</P>
      <P>The consumption vouchers are just one of a number of measures the government has
proposed to boost the local economy, which contracted in the third quarter by
1.02 percent.</P>

      <P>More than 150 works of art and relics unearthed in Xinjiang province, China,
including the "Loulan Beauty" mummy, will be displayed in Taipei to showcase the
cultural diversity of the Silk Road, the exhibition curators said Friday.</P>
      <P>Titled "Legends of the Silk Road--Treasures from Xinjiang, " the exhibition will
give Taiwan people an idea of the cultures that converged on the ancient trade
route, said Huang Yung-chuan, director of the National Museum of History where
the exhibition will be staged.</P>
      <P>The works of art, well preserved thanks to the dry climate in western China,
have great value in terms of academic study on the trade, transportation and
Chinese-Western exchanges on the Silk Road, Hang said at a press conference.
They will also allow a glimpse into diverse ethnic civilizations and traditions,
such as ancient funeral customs, he added.</P>
      <P>The most eye-catching exhibit is the "Loulan Beauty" mummy that dates back 3,800
years, he said.</P>
      <P>The mummy is a female between 40 and 45 years of age and of Indo-European
descent. She was unearthed lying on her side as though in sleep, a tuft of hair
falling across her head and ragged moccasins on her feet, and is considered once
of the best preserved mummies ever found.</P>
      <P>The mummy was discovered in the 1980s in the ancient Loulan region along China's
Silk Road in Xinjiang province.</P>
      <P>Since then, she has only been on display once outside China -- in Japan,
according to Aierken Mijiti, standing deputy-director of the Cultural Heritage
Bureau of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region which is providing the exhibits.</P>
      <P>"Through the current exhibition, we hope the distance between Xinjiang and
Taiwan would be narrowed, and that the Taiwanese people would have a better
understanding of Xinjiang province and the cultures of the Silk Road," he said.</P>
      <P>The exhibition will also include pre-Qin metal vessels, textiles dating back to
the Han Dynasty and later, funeral objects found in the Xiaohe cemetery, and
paintings on silk from the Tang Dynasty.</P>
      <P>The Silk Road was a trade route opened up during the Western Han Dynasty (206
BC-24 AD) and it extended for over 7,000 kilometers to connect Asia and the
Mediterranean region.</P>
      <P>The Silk Road proved to be of great historical and cultural importance  because
of its geographical  location and bustling business, and the interactions of
different cultures and religions.</P>
      <P>The museum divided the 150 items unearthed into five categories: The beauty of
the Silk Road, The Traces of the Silk Road, The Wonders of the Silk Road, The
Ancient Kingdoms of the Silk Road and The Gods of the Silk Road.</P>
      <P>The exhibition will be held from December 6 to March 15 next year at the

    <HEADLINE>Bisphenol A may be listed potentially toxic substance in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) is planning to officially list
bisphenol A (BPA) as a potentially toxic substance in light of increased public
concern that it may pose a health risk to humans, especially infants, an
official said Friday.</P>
      <P>After  BPA is listed  as a potentially  toxic  substance, manufacturers that use
the chemical in their products will be required to file a declaration with the
EPA, according to Wu Wen-chuan, deputy chief of the EPA's Department of
Environmental Sanitation and Toxic Substance Management.</P>
      <P>BPA has been placed on an EPA watch list since 2007.</P>
      <P>The chemical is commonly found in certain hard plastic products, including
polycarbonate (PC) baby bottles. It is thought to be an endocrine disruptor and
has been proven harmful to animals in laboratory experiments, raising concerns
that it could cause negative health effects in humans.</P>
      <P>With health concerns over BPA increasing worldwide in recent years, Canada
announced in April this year its intention to ban the import and sale of PC
bottles containing BPA, making it the first country in the world to take action
on the chemical, Wu pointed out.</P>
      <P>While Japan has placed BPA on its list of possible endocrine disruptors,  the
United States has required the manufacturers, importers and processors of BPA-
made products to submit related information to authorities, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The European Union, meanwhile, has set a limit of 30 ppb for BPA emissions, Wu
said.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, as the metabolic systems of infants and young children are not
as developed as adults, BPA consumption is likely to affect their reproductive
system.</P>
      <P>There have not been any reports of such incidents in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As BPA has not been banned in containers for baby use, Wu urged the public to
avoid putting high-temperature liquids in these containers and discard
containers that have cracked to reduce the risk that the chemical has been
released into the food or beverage being consumed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Natural gas prices should be cut further: Consumers' Foundation</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Natural gas prices in Taiwan should be cut further even after a 2.99 percent
drop announced earlier this week by the the state-run petroleum refiner, CPC
Corp. Taiwan, the Consumers' Foundation suggested Friday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Tien-jen, chairman of the non-profit civil organization, said natural gas
prices should have room for another 40 percent cut to reflect the international
market price.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also suggested that Taiwan follow in the U.S.' footsteps and print the
current international natural gas price on receipts to keep consumers informed.</P>
      <P>CPC on Tuesday announced its first adjustment of domestic natural gas prices
since May 28, dropping the price by 2.99 percent on average. This translated
into a price reduction of between NT$0.24 per cubic meter and NT$1.63 per cubic
meter, depending on the category of natural gas user.</P>
      <P>On May 28, CPC's natural gas price was raised by NT$3.85 per cubic meter from
the average NT$13.46 per cubic meter due to skyrocketing international crude oil
prices.</P>
      <P>The price cut Tuesday, made retroactive to Dec. 1, was the biggest drop in
natural gas prices announced by CPC since it was authorized to adjust prices.
The announcement came as a surprise, as the company had initially said it would
not lower natural gas prices until next month.</P>
      <P>On Friday, CPC officials rebutted media reports that it was about to further
slash natural gas prices by 7 percent, saying they were purely speculative.</P>
      <P>CPC is allowed to adjust the price of natural gas within a range of 3 percent
each month without government permission.</P>
      <P>The company is currently discussing with the relevant authorities whether to
lower the prices further considering that its natural gas department has
recorded an accumulated loss of NT$35 billion (US$1.04 billion) this year due to
import costs outstripping domestic prices, CPC Chairman Wenent Pan said.</P>
      <P>Citing data showing that natural gas futures in New York plunged by 47 percent,
from US$12.977 per MMbtu on July 7 to US$6.92 per MMbtu on Oct. 20, Hsieh said
domestic natural gas prices should be reduced to the pre-May 28 level.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that CPC review its operational performance.</P>

      <P>With a NT$58.3 billion (US$1.75 billion) infrastructure expansion project in an
economic stimulus package put in place by the central government, local
governments are confident that construction of public works projects in their
area will be launched by the end of this year, Public Construction Commission
Minister Frank Fan said Friday.</P>
      <P>Fan made the remarks at a news conference held following a meeting earlier
Friday with Premier Liu Chao-shiuan. Also present at the meeting were government
officials from 11 local areas, where the launch of public works projects have
lagged behind that of Taiwan's 14 other cities and counties.</P>
      <P>According to Fan, Liu encouraged the local governments to closely cooperate with
the Executive Yuan in completing construction of their projects so as to help
stimulate Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>At present,  an average  72.09 percent of all the public construction projects
nationwide -- 6,733 cases out of a total of 9,340 -- are under construction, Fan
said.</P>
      <P>As of early December, only the offshore Kinmen and Lienchiang counties have
fully launched construction of their 11 and five projects, respectively, Fan
noted.</P>
      <P>However, the 11 local cities and counties -- including Yilan, Hsinchu,  Taitung,
Nantou, Tainan, Kaohsiung, Changhua, Taipei, Yunlin, Pingtung counties and
Chiayi City -- have each failed to reach a 75 percent construction rate, Fan
said.</P>
      <P>Fan pointed out that Pingtung County in southern Taiwan has registered the
lowest rate of 2.45 percent, but deputy magistrate Chung Chia-pin asserted
during the meeting that all the county's public construction projects will be
kicked off by late this month as slated.</P>
      <P>The minister  said that budgets  earmarked  for the local governments to carry
out the task will be returned to the national coffers in due process if they
fail to meet the year-end deadline.</P>
      <P>Later Friday,  Chung clarified  that the Pintung  County's construction rate has
hit 22.34 percent -- or 168 cases under construction out of a total of 752

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) presented Friday new varieties of
rice and cabbage that it said are more environmentally  friendly and more
adaptable to warm temperatures.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Jung-wu, director of the Taichung District Agricultural
Research and Extension Station (TDARES) under the COA, unhusked rice grains
usually have fine spikes called awns attached to them.</P>
      <P>He said that the awns often cause air pollution and cause rice workers to
develop problems such as skin irritations during the milling of the rice. As a
result, during the harvesting period, people living near rice mills have to
close their doors and windows tightly, he added.</P>
      <P>However, after years of effort, the TDARES in central Taiwan has succeeded in
creating Taiwan's first rice variety without awns, he said.</P>
      <P>"Thanks to the new variety, named "Taichung 193, " not only the quality of the
product, but also people's living environment has improved," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Although the crops of the new rice variety in some regions were poor and it is
not very resistant to blight, the research team is working on improvements and
is trying to develop new awn-free varieties, he said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the TDARES has also developed a new variety of cabbage, a common
vegetable in Taiwan, that is more resistant to warm temperatures, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He added that the most popular cabbage variety in Taiwan, which has a market
share of 70 percent, does not thrive well in high temperatures. To meet the
market demand in summer, farmers have been forced to grow cabbages at high
altitudes.</P>
      <P>To solve problems of high prime cost and warmer temperatures, the TDARES in
December 2007 developed the "Taichung 1" cabbage variety that has proved to be
more resistant to high temperatures and is expected to help stabilize cabbage
harvests at low altitudes in late summer, fall and winter, Chen said.</P>

      <P>The Special Investigation Division of the Supreme Prosecutors Office on Friday
listed a college classmate of former first lady Wu Shu-jen as a defendant for
allegedly helping Wu with money laundering, increasing the number of defendants
in the case to 12.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Chen Yun-nan, director of the division, confirmed that his division
had summoned Wu's former classmate Tsai Mei-li for questioning as a defendant in
the case, but said Tsai begged out of the session because she was ill.</P>
      <P>Tsai's two brothers -- Tsai Ming-che and Tsai Ming-chieh -- have already been
listed as defendants in the case for allegedly serving as proxies in helping the
former first family launder money abroad.</P>
      <P>In addition to Wu, three other members of the former first family --  former
President Chen Shui-bian,  son Chen Chih-chung and daughter-in-law Huang Jui-
ching -- have all been listed as chief defendants in the money laundering case.</P>
      <P>Others listed as defendants include the former first lady's elder brother Wu
Ching-mao, his wife Chen Chun-ying, former Mega Financial Holding Co. Chairman
Cheng Shen-chih, Yuanta Securities board member Tu Li-ping, and former
Presidential Office cashier Chen Chen-hui.</P>
      <P>None of those listed as defendants in the case have been indicted on charges
related to money laundering, as at this stage in the investigation they are
still only viewed as suspects.</P>
      <P>Wu Ching-mao was released Nov. 28 on NT$2 million (US$59,580) bail after he had
been held in custody for 53 days to prevent possible collusion among the
defendants and witnesses.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors who examined the information provided by judicial authorities of
Singapore about an account owned by Wu Ching-mao believe they have enough
evidence to suspect that Tsai Mei-li and her brothers helped the former first
lady transfer millions of U. S. dollars illegally to her brother's account with
South Africa's Standard Bank in Singapore through their bank accounts in Hong
Kong.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors found that they money was later wired to a Swiss bank account held
by the son and daughter-in-law of the former president and his wife.</P>
      <P>Before listing Tsai Mei-li as a defendant, the prosecutors questioned her four
times. On Sept. 25, they searched her residence and office for possible
evidence. Her brother Tsai Ming-che has been held in custody since Oct. 2.</P>
      <P>In addition to their alleged violations of laws against money laundering, Chen
Shui-bian and his wife also face investigation on charges of embezzling state
affairs funds of the Presidential Office and accepting bribes during the former
president's two terms between 2000 and 2008.</P>
      <P>With the permission of the Taipei District Court, the Special Investigation
Division has detained the former president since Nov. 12, after interrogating
him for six hours a day earlier.</P>

      <P>The show was organized by Taipei County's Cultural Affairs Bureau under a
memorandum of understanding signed by Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei and
Nanjing City Mayor Jiang Hongkun in July to pave the way for exchanges in art,
trade, and agriculture.</P>
      <P>Nanjing City Deputy Mayor Chen Gang said the city has rich cultural resources,
as it has a 2,470-year history and served as the capital of China during six
different dynasties.</P>
      <P>Liu Jien, head of a visiting cultural delegation of about 140 members from
Nanjing City, said the cultural exchanges will help close the gap between the
people on both sides.</P>

      <P>The government will spend NT$47 billion (US$1.4 billion) over the next four
years to repair or reinforce run-down school buildings throughout the country,
Minister of Education Cheng Jei-cheng said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, the old school building renovation program will form a
critical part of a major infrastructure construction project designed by the
Executive Yuan to help spur domestic demand amid the current global economic
recession.</P>
      <P>Under the program, 5,250 dilapidated elementary and junior high school
classrooms  and 980 senior and vocational  high school classrooms will be
renovated.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 2,045 other classrooms will be reinforced to enhance their ability to
resist earthquakes.</P>
      <P>Given the government's limited budget, Cheng said, the ministry will appropriate
NT$2.5 billion to repair elementary and junior high school classrooms and
another NT$700 million to revamp senior and vocational high school classrooms in
2009, the first year of the project.</P>

      <P>Consumer prices in Taiwan have stabilized and may even be on the decline, as the
consumer price index (CPI) fell month-on-month by 1.08 percent in November and
wholesale prices fell at an even faster clip, the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) reported Friday.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the CPI stood at 106.74 in November, 1.08 percent lower
than in October and 1.88 percent higher than in the same month last year. The
year-on-year rise was the lowest since September 2007, it said.</P>
      <P>The report attributed the latest weakness in prices to declines in crude oil and
grain prices in the international market.</P>
      <P>Reductions in domestic fuel and liquefied natural gas prices, overseas tour
package costs and food products made from wheat and soybean, also steadied
prices last month.</P>
      <P>The wholesale price index (WPI) stood at 104.94 in November, sliding 5.31
percent from the previous month's level and 4.95-percent year-on-year, the first
fall after rising for 36 consecutive months.</P>
      <P>Because of higher inflation earlier in the year, the average WPI in the first 11
months of the year grew by 6.63 percent compared with the same period in 2007,
the DGBAS said.</P>

      <P>Patients with heart disease in Taiwan should have a checkup as early as possible
to find out whether they have coronary artery disease, a doctor with Chang Gung
Memorial Hospital in Keelung said Friday.</P>
      <P>Wu Kuan-chun, a diagnostic radiologist, pointed out that heart disease is one of
the top 10 causes of death in Taiwan, ranking fourth after cancer, accidents and
chronic liver disease.</P>
      <P>Wu cited statistics as showing that 80 percent of those who died of heart
disease in Taiwan died because of coronary artery stenosis -- the abnormal
constriction of a coronary artery, and that 30 percent of them died after
suffering their first heart attacks.</P>
      <P>As a precautionary measure, patients with heart disease should get a three-
dimensional CT (computed tomography) scan as soon as possible, he said, adding
that the 64-slice computed tomography can have an accuracy rate of 99 percent.</P>
      <P>Coronary artery disease usually begins when hard cholesterol substances, known
as plaques, are deposited within a coronary artery. The plaques in the coronary
arteries can cause a tiny clot to form, which can obstruct the flow of blood to
the heart muscle producing chest pain or trigger a heart attack or sudden death.</P>

      <P>A pair of giant pandas will get speedy customs clearance upon arrival in Taiwan
from China, the Taipei Zoo said Friday.</P>
      <P>Zoo Director Jason Yeh said as soon as the plane carrying the two pandas -- Tuan
Tuan and Yuan Yuan -- lands at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, customs
officials will examine the quarantine papers before giving the green light for
their entry.</P>
      <P>Yeh said a motorcade will escort the two pandas to the zoo, which is expected to
take one hour, to cut the discomfort of their long trip to the minimum.</P>
      <P>An official of the quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) announced a
day earlier that the two pandas will arrive before Christmas.</P>
      <P>SEF Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Kao Koong-lian said the necessary papers
for the pandas' entry are being prepared by the SEF and its China counterpart,
the Association For Relations Across the Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that if the pandas could come before Christmas, then they might make
their debut in front of the public before the Lunar New Year, which falls on
Jan. 26.</P>
      <P>"The SEF and the ARATS have chosen two dates for the delivery prior to Dec. 24,
but have yet to make a final decision," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>He also said the zoo has formed a team, including two senior animal feeding
staff and 18 veterinarians and assistants, to take care of the pandas.</P>
      <P>"After the zoo learns of the exact date of delivery, it will send two animal
feeding staff two weeks in advance to Sichuan to have close contact with the two
pandas," he added.</P>
      <P>This is because the pandas have a sharp sense of smell and the staff would like
to nurture a relationship with the animals to facilitate their care in the zoo.</P>
      <P>The zoo estimates that the two pandas will consume between 40 kilograms and 80
kgs. of bamboo shoots a day, and the zoo is planting more bamboo.</P>
      <P>The zoo will allocate NT$1.02 million annually for the bamboo expenses, he
added.</P>
      <P>China first promised to send the two pandas as a gift to Taiwan during a meeting
between the-then Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and Chinese leader Hu Jintao in

    <HEADLINE>Beijing urged to approve Amway China employees' Taiwan tour plan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) wrote to its Chinese counterpart Friday
seeking its assistance in pushing the Chinese government to approve a planned
visit to Taiwan next year by Amway China Co.'s management and sales staff.</P>
      <P>Some 13,000 employees  from the U.S.-based  direct selling company's China
operations are set to take a cruise to Taiwan next March, which is expected to
give a badly needed shot in the arm to the island's tourism industry.</P>
      <P>However, Amway's Taiwan subsidiary sought the SEF's help Thursday as the Chinese
government reportedly is unwilling to approve the Amway China staff's travel
plans because the Chinese employees will come from all parts of the country, not
just the designated 13 provinces whose residents are now allowed to make
pleasure trips to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In its message to the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS), the SEF said the Amway China staff will mainly attend an
advanced personnel training camp during their stay in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the SEF said Taiwan is only a stop in the Amway staff's planned
overseas package tour which will also take them to Japan and other destinations.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the SEF said the Amway staff's Taiwan travel plan should
not be subject to the restrictions  of a cross-strait agreement on Chinese
citizens' sightseeing trips to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According  to an accord signed  by the heads of the two quasi-official
intermediary bodies -- SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and ARATS President Chen
Yulin -- in June in Beijing, Taiwan will admit up to 3,000 Chinese tourists per
day and China will allow residents in 13 specified municipalities and provinces
to make pleasure trips to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Stressing  that the Amway group's Taiwan travel plan will contribute
significantly to cross-strait civilian exchanges, the SEF wrote in its letter
that Taiwan has approved the Amway's plan on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>"We look forward to your assistance in coordinating an approval by relevant
mainland agencies as soon as possible to facilitate the smooth proceeding of the
travel plan," the SEF wrote.</P>
      <P>According to the original plan, Amway China employees will visit in several
groups on cruise liners from Shanghai to Keelung Harbor and Taichung Harbor.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF head assures Japan there is no Taiwan-China economic threat</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Dec.  5 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and China are independent economic entities within the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and will not become one economy that could pose a threat to
Japan, Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) chairman, Chiang Pin-kung,
said in Tokyo Friday.</P>
      <P>Although one of President Ma Ying-jeou's policies is to build closer economic
ties and ultimately ink a comprehensive economic cooperation agreement (CECA)
with China, Chiang said, Taiwan and China will not integrate into one economic
entity because they are independent WTO members that each hold negotiations on
an equal footing under the WTO framework.</P>
      <P>"It is a totally different case from that of Hong Kong and China, which signed a
closer economic partnership agreement (CEPA) with each other in line with
Beijing's 'one-country, two systems' formula," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan hopes to boost economic  development  through cooperation with
China, there is no need for Japan to worry about the possibility of a Taiwan-
China economic threat, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Chiang made the remarks during a meeting held at the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Representative Office in Japan to explain to Japanese political figures
and media the recent developments in cross-Taiwan Strait ties.</P>
      <P>The SEF and China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS)
-- the two intermediary bodies in charge of cross-strait negotiations -- have
agreed to deal with practical economic issues before complex political matters,
Chiang said.</P>
      <P>"It would be a long time before Taiwan and China could start political talks, "
he said, adding that "clinching a CECA with China is currently one of Taiwan's
long-term goals."</P>
      <P>Mainland China and Hong Kong absorb about 40 percent of Taiwan's exports, while
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and Japan take some 15 percent and 7
percent, respectively, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the question of whether Taiwan is allowed to take part in the 2009
annual conference of the World Health Assembly in May as an observer will serve
as a test of Taiwan-China relations, which have showed improvements over the
past six months, he said.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan continues to be excluded from the WHA annual meeting due to Beijing's
interference, the Taiwan people will be very hurt," he said.</P>
      <P>Stating that Taiwan is eager to sign a free trade agreement or an economic
partnership agreement with Japan, he called on the Japanese government to
respond soon to Taiwan's overtures.</P>
      <P>Chiang left for Japan Thursday on a three-day visit with the aim of explaining
the recent developments in Taiwan-China relations to Japanese figures and
Taiwanese expatriates  there and to make arrangements for a visit by ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung to Japan next week.</P>
      <P>Japan has long been a close ally of Taiwan in the region.</P>
      <P>Before his departure from Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport Thursday, the SEF
chief noted that Taiwan-China ties have improved significantly since Ma assumed
office in May and that a visit to Taipei last month by ARATS President Chen
Yunlin had further boosted bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese officials have said that the island's closer relations with China will
not jeopardize  Taiwan's relations with other countries, but rather would
benefit the region by fostering peace and stability.</P>
      <P>In a follow-up to their historic encounter in June in Beijing, Chiang and Chen
inked four cooperation pacts during their second meeting in Taipei last month.</P>
      <P>The agreements, slated to take effect from Dec. 15, will allow for the expansion
of direct weekend charter flights between the two sides into a daily service,
and the launch of direct shipping and postal links. An agreement to cooperate on
food safety control was also inked.</P>
      <P>Chiang expressed confidence Thursday that the four pacts will benefit both sides
of the Taiwan Strait, particularly the accords on the establishment of direct
shipping and air travel links.</P>

      <P>The Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC)  will promote cooperation among
small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) in Taiwan, Hong Kong and China to tap
into the vast Chinese market, the head of the council's Taipei office said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Perry Fung made the pledge at a cocktail reception marking the opening of the
HKTDC Taiwan office, which will formally become operational early next year.</P>
      <P>Noting that China already has a middle-class population of 230 million, Fung
said the Chinese consumer market is worth developing and that there is ample
room for SMEs in the three Chinese-speaking societies to cooperate in exploring
such an immense opportunity.</P>
      <P>Senior HKTDC executives also traveled to Taipei to attend the opening reception,
which saw the attendance of many Taiwanese trade promoters and business
managers, including Wang Chih-kang, chairman of the Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA).</P>
      <P>Addressing the occasion, HKTDC Chairman Jack So said capital, commodity and
manpower exchanges among Taiwan, China and Hong Kong will get ever closer in the
future.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, So said the HKTDC decided to open a branch in Taipei to
facilitate further cooperation.</P>
      <P>The HKTDC,  a Hong Kong  government-funded  but unofficial organization, began
considering opening a branch in Taiwan five years ago, but did not file an
application until after the Kuomintang -- seen as more friendly toward China
than the previous Democratic Progressive Party administration -- regained power
in Taiwan in May this year.</P>
      <P>After Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs approved the HKTDC application in
October, the Hong Kong group sent Fung -- formerly the HKTDC Beijing office's
top executive in charge of the northern China market -- to Taipei to prepare for
the opening of the new office.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government has warmly welcomed the HKTDC's decision to establish a
foothold in Taipei as it will facilitate bilateral trade and civic exchanges.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong is Taiwan's fourth- largest trading partner after China, Japan and the
United States.</P>
      <P>According to customs statistics, Taiwan-Hong Kong trade totaled US$39.8 billion
in 2007, accounting for 8.54 percent of Taiwan's overall foreign trade for the
year. Of that amount, Taiwan's exports accounted for US$37.98 billion, or 15.4
percent of the country's total exports for the year, making Hong Kong Taiwan's
second-largest export outlet after China.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Hong Kong invested more than US$200 million in Taiwan, up 76
percent from 2006, while Taiwan's investment in Hong Kong for that year totaled
about US$190 million.</P>
      <P>In the first six months of this year, Hong Kong investment had already topped
US$236 million, far exceeding its investment for the whole of 2007, according to
official Taiwan government tallies.</P>

      <P>The Red Cross Society of the Republic of China signed a post-reconstruction
agreement with its Chinese counterpart in Sichuan province Friday, according to
a press release issued by the society in Taipei.</P>
      <P>C.V. Chen, president of Taiwan's Red Cross Society, signed the agreement with
Jiang Yiman, executive vice president of the Red Cross Society of China, in
Yinxiu township, Wenchuan, one of the hardest hit areas in the May 12 quake.</P>
      <P>Chen earlier visited a mass grave in Yinxiu, which was located at the epicenter
of the magnitude-8.0 earthquake, to pay tribute to tens of thousands of victims
of the devastating temblor.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Red Cross Society arrived in the quake-stricken area with
donations and relief supplies.</P>
      <P>The society intends to spend NT$1.595 billion (US$47.89 million) in remote parts
of Sichuan, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces to rebuild 44 schools, 43 health care
facilities and one rehabilitation center for the disabled in the Aba Tibetan-
Qiang Autonomous Region, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He added that the Red Cross Society will also sponsor schooling for impoverished
children in the affected areas, and work with nonprofit organizations in Taiwan
and China to promote social service programs so as to help the underpriviledged
people in the affected areas return to normal life.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that 32,648 students and more than 1.5 million affected
residents in Sichuan, Gansu and Shaanxi will benefit from the assistance, the
press release said.</P>
      <P>Official figures as of July 21, 2008, put the number of confirmed dead from the
earthquake at 69,227, including 68,636 in Sichuan province. Another 374,176 were
listed as injured, with 18,222 listed as missing.</P>
      <P>The earthquake left about 4.8 million people homeless, according to official
statistics, but that number could be as high as 11 million. Approximately 15
million people lived in the affected area.</P>

      <P>A single mother whose only son was killed at the age of 17 and once was obsessed
with getting revenge is now more forgiving and advises others facing similar
predicaments to "forgive others so you can spare yourself."</P>
      <P>Mrs. You from the northeastern city of Yilan, whose husband died of an illness
10 years ago and whose son was killed at a barbecue nine years ago, was
directing her message at the parents of the victim of a campus murder in 1998.</P>
      <P>With the convicted assailant, former National Tsinghua University graduate
student Hung Hsiao-huei, released Thursday after spending nearly 11 years in
jail for murdering classmate and love rival Hsu Chia-chen, You has advised Hsu's
parents to "forgive Hung to allow yourselves to live."</P>
      <P>You said she spent three years in living hell after her son was stabbed to death
by a 15-year-old  youth surnamed Yang in a free-for-all.</P>
      <P>During those years, she recalled, she was so distracted that she once dumped
rice into the toilet as she was preparing to cook it.</P>
      <P>She said she would also open the door late at night upon "hearing something
outside, " but never saw her son there. When she repeated the behavior for
weeks, relatives from her mother's side of the family took her to her mother's
home to live to prevent accidents from occurring.</P>
      <P>You also admitted that she hid knives and pesticide in her purse when appearing
in court as a witness during Yang's trial, hoping to kill him first and then
herself.</P>
      <P>In another of her obsessive acts, You bought four child-sized figures made of
resin home and changed the clothes of the four boy models every day, pretending
they were her son.</P>
      <P>None of those actions helped reduce You's thirst for revenge until one day three
years ago when a voice from within asked her, "if your son was the killer, would
you hope for forgiveness from the victim's family?"</P>
      <P>Those words awakened You like a thunderbolt. The next morning, she visited Chiu
Sung-shan, a volunteer with a victims protection association in Yilan and
directly asked Chiu, "has the boy fared well in jail?"</P>
      <P>You began writing regularly to Yang, her son's killer. She even traveled from
Yilan to the southern port city of Kaohsiung to pay him a visit in prison.</P>
      <P>When Yang asked her to hug him, You said, she broke down and wept and acceded to
Yang's request. At that moment, she said, she felt as though her son was back.</P>
      <P>Gradually, she gave the figure models away as well as all the clothes left by
her son. She also put away all photos of her deceased son while continuing to
write Yang letters.</P>
      <P>Last year, when Yang was released on parole, the young man called her, telling
her that he would look for a job to earn some money to support his family. You,
nevertheless, encouraged him to return to school.</P>
      <P>Recalling four years ago when he received a letter from You, Yang said he was
shocked to learn that the mother of his victim was visiting him.</P>
      <P>He said he was absolutely unprepared as You visited on the same day he received
the letter and was numb and speechless when he first saw her.</P>
      <P>Presently a college student, Yang said he now has two mothers to take care of,
vowing that he will take good care of You throughout his life to compensate her
for her loss.</P>

      <P>A website of Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan, the pair of giant pandas that is expected
to arrive in Taipei this month as a sign of warming ties between Taiwan and
China, was launched by the Taipei City Zoo on Friday.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Education Department Director Wu Ching-shan said at the website's
launching ceremony that the Taipei City Zoo has made all the necessary
preparations to receive the pair of endangered animals, including setting up a
website for them.</P>
      <P>"We have video links on the website for people to watch the precious

    <HEADLINE>Government urged to help salvage local DRAM industry</HEADLINE>

      <P>Powerchip Semiconductor Corp. Chairman Frank Huang has called on the government
to help the ailing DRAM (dynamic random access memory) industry survive, arguing
that it is a strategic industry in Taiwan and its survival would influence the
development of other technology sectors.</P>
      <P>Oversupply and shrinking demand due to the global economic downturn have caused
a drastic slump in DRAM prices and sent most players deep into the red.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan's DRAM industry dies, South Korea will become the world's monopoly in
the sector, a development that could have great impact on the future of high-
technology industries and a consequence the government cannot afford to neglect,
Huang, the chief of the nation's largest computer memory chipmaker warned
Thursday on the sidelines of a technology forum in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"As a result, prices of all the PC and consumer electronic products in the world
would be determined by South Korea because DRAM components are the core of all
the products," Huang explained.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and South Korea are the only two DRAM manufacturing countries in the
world, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently has four major DRAM chipmakers which have been in the red for
more than one and half years, owing NT$400 billion (US$11.6 billion) in debt at
the end of September this year.</P>
      <P>The government is mulling measures bailing out the sector for fear that leaving
it alone would trigger nationwide financial turmoil, including the possibility
of putting some 20,000 workers in the industry out of jobs.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan's electronics industry has been one of the most competitive
industrial sectors in the country, the government should take measures to save
the DRAM industry so that the competitiveness of the island's electronics and PC
industries can be maintained, he said.</P>
      <P>The survival of Taiwan's  DRAM industry will also benefit downstream companies,
Huang noted. For example, laptop maker ASUSTeK Computer Inc. has said that with
cooperative ties with local DRAM manufacturers, the company is able to cut
transport costs and enjoy the convenience of speedy product delivery and other
benefits, Huang noted.</P>
      <P>He did not specify what the government should do, but insisted something should
be done efficiently and with the lowest cost.</P>
      <P>Huang expressed hope that the government would help consolidate the strategic
partnership  among Taiwan's  Powerchip,  Rexchip Electronics Corp and Japan's
Elpida Memory Inc, and assist with the merger among Taiwan's Inotera Memories
Inc, Nanya Technology Corp and the U.S. Micron Technology Inc. to enable local
DRAM companies to become more competitive through integration and globalization.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Huang said that given the sharp depreciation of the South Korean won,
Taiwan particularly needs to take measures to salvage the DRAM industry when it
is in a disadvantaged position in a competition with South Korea, in terms of
DRAM exports.</P>
      <P>Besides DRAM production, Taiwan and South Korea are competing fiercely in TFT-
LCD panel production, according to an economic official Friday in response to
Huang's remarks.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging the importance of the DRAM industry in Taiwan, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs has formed a task force aimed at providing guidance and
assistance for the industry, said the official who spoke on condition of
anonynimity.</P>
      <P>The official said that the ministry will focus its efforts on helping DRAM
companies conduct industrial upgrade through enhancing research and development
capabilities in order to raise their competitiveness.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's railway system has inaugurated its first "green" station, which will
provide transportation services with state-of-the-art, eco-friendly design and
technologies, senior administrators said Friday.</P>
      <P>At a ceremony to celebrate the inauguration of the renovated Dalin Station in
the southern county of Chiayi, Taiwan Railways Administration Director-General
Frank Fan praised the station as a "pastiche of history and modernity."</P>
      <P>The station's old building, which was preserved in the renovation project, was
built in 1903 under Japanese colonial rule, while the new "green"  service
complex is equipped  with all kinds of eco-friendly technology.</P>
      <P>Lauding  it as "the  most  novel,  most  beautiful,  most user-friendly" station
among the 200 or so train stations in Taiwan, Fan said the complex is a
100-percent "green building" that not only fully relies on natural ventilation
and natural light, but also recycles rainwater and converts sunlight into
electricity.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Fan continued, to reduce the pollution caused by the station itself
and railway operations, the station is also equipped with noise reducing units
and air purifiers that can reduce the exhaust of diesel locomotives,</P>
      <P>In addition, the new complex also adopted the "overpass station" design that
places the service areas over the rails, both to reduce the area occupied and
allow free access from both sides of the rails.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's Legislature approves bill to issue consumption vouchers</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5 (CNA)
12/05/08  19:09:15
(By Andrew Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed a bill Friday that authorizes the government to
issue NT$3,600 (US$108)  in consumption vouchers to Taiwan's citizens in an
attempt to stimulate the country's slumping retail sector and boost the overall
economy.</P>
      <P>The plan, which will cost approximately NT$83.5 billion and boost 2009 gross
domestic product growth by 0.64 percent if all the vouchers are used, was passed
without much resistance given the ruling Kuomintang's two-thirds majority in the
lawmaking body.</P>
      <P>To finalize the voucher plan and ensure the vouchers can be distributed by the
government's target date of Jan. 18, the Cabinet must still submit a consumption
voucher budget bill -- needed to secure funding for the program -- to the
legislature by Dec. 8 at noon.</P>
      <P>The bill must then be approved by related legislative committees by Dec. 22 and
the full legislature by Dec. 26 for the program to go forward and meet the
distribution deadline.</P>
      <P>Should the budget bill be passed, as is expected, the vouchers would first be
issued on Jan. 18, a week before the Lunar New Year holiday, and then after the
holiday until March 31.</P>
      <P>The vouchers will be valid for use until Sept. 30, 2009, and retailers must
claim reimbursement for the vouchers by Oct. 31, 2009.</P>
      <P>Prior to Friday's vote on the bill's contents, the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party pushed its own alternative measure, which called for the
distribution of NT$3,800 in cash, instead of vouchers, to Taiwan's citizens.</P>
      <P>Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng called a meeting between KMT and DPP lawmakers
to try and bridge the gap between the two measures, without success.</P>
      <P>All Taiwanese citizens, with the exception of those living abroad without an
identity card, local registration or residency rights, as well as their foreign
spouses will be eligible to receive NT$3,600 in vouchers.</P>
      <P>Those  born by the end of March 2009 who have household registrations as
citizens of the Republic of China will be eligible for the program, according to
one of a set of resolutions attached to the bill.</P>
      <P>Critics of the bill have argued that the voucher program will have potentially
high administrative costs, including the cost of printing a voucher that is hard
to counterfeit.</P>
      <P>To contain these expenses, another resolution attached to the bill stipulated
that administrative costs could not exceed 3 percent of the special budget
earmarked for the program.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan proposed the last month as a way to pump money into Taiwan's
flagging retail sector. The vouchers must be used to purchase goods locally and
cannot be deposited as savings in banks or exchanged for cash.</P>
      <P>Those who donate their coupons to charity, however, will be entitled to a tax
deduction.</P>
      <P>The consumption vouchers are just one of a number of measures the government has
proposed to boost the local economy, which contracted in the third quarter by
1.02 percent.</P>

      <P>An infamous gunman and drug trafficker who fled Taiwan 14 years ago was escorted
back home from the Philippines Friday, police said.</P>
      <P>Chen Kuan-yuan, 52, was arrested by Taiwan police in 1993 for smuggling heroin
into the country from Thailand and possessing firearms, according to the
Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB).</P>
      <P>Chen fled to Southeast Asia using a fake passport in 1994, before the Kaohsiung

      <P>More than 150 works of art and relics unearthed in Xinjiang province, China,
including the "Loulan Beauty" mummy, will be displayed in Taipei to showcase the
cultural diversity of the Silk Road, the exhibition curators said Friday.</P>
      <P>Titled "Legends of the Silk Road--Treasures from Xinjiang, " the exhibition will
give Taiwan people an idea of the cultures that converged on the ancient trade
route, said Huang Yung-chuan, director of the National Museum of History where
the exhibition will be staged.</P>
      <P>The works of art, well preserved thanks to the dry climate in western China,
have great value in terms of academic study on the trade, transportation and
Chinese-Western exchanges on the Silk Road, Hang said at a press conference.
They will also allow a glimpse into diverse ethnic civilizations and traditions,
such as ancient funeral customs, he added.</P>
      <P>The most eye-catching exhibit is the "Loulan Beauty" mummy that dates back 3,800
years, he said.</P>
      <P>The mummy is a female between 40 and 45 years of age and of Indo-European
descent. She was unearthed lying on her side as though in sleep, a tuft of hair
falling across her head and ragged moccasins on her feet, and is considered once
of the best preserved mummies ever found.</P>
      <P>The mummy was discovered in the 1980s in the ancient Loulan region along China's
Silk Road in Xinjiang province.</P>
      <P>Since then, she has only been on display once outside China -- in Japan,
according to Aierken Mijiti, standing deputy-director of the Cultural Heritage
Bureau of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region which is providing the exhibits.</P>
      <P>"Through the current exhibition, we hope the distance between Xinjiang and
Taiwan would be narrowed, and that the Taiwanese people would have a better
understanding of Xinjiang province and the cultures of the Silk Road," he said.</P>
      <P>The exhibition will also include pre-Qin metal vessels, textiles dating back to
the Han Dynasty and later, funeral objects found in the Xiaohe cemetery, and
paintings on silk from the Tang Dynasty.</P>
      <P>The Silk Road was a trade route opened up during the Western Han Dynasty (206
BC-24 AD) and it extended for over 7,000 kilometers to connect Asia and the
Mediterranean region.</P>
      <P>The Silk Road proved to be of great historical and cultural importance  because
of its geographical  location and bustling business, and the interactions of
different cultures and religions.</P>
      <P>The museum divided the 150 items unearthed into five categories: The beauty of
the Silk Road, The Traces of the Silk Road, The Wonders of the Silk Road, The
Ancient Kingdoms of the Silk Road and The Gods of the Silk Road.</P>
      <P>The exhibition will be held from December 6 to March 15 next year at the
National Museum of History.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Bisphenol A may be listed potentially toxic substance in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) is planning to officially list
bisphenol A (BPA) as a potentially toxic substance in light of increased public
concern that it may pose a health risk to humans, especially infants, an
official said Friday.</P>
      <P>After  BPA is listed  as a potentially  toxic  substance, manufacturers that use
the chemical in their products will be required to file a declaration with the
EPA, according to Wu Wen-chuan, deputy chief of the EPA's Department of
Environmental Sanitation and Toxic Substance Management.</P>
      <P>BPA has been placed on an EPA watch list since 2007.</P>
      <P>The chemical is commonly found in certain hard plastic products, including
polycarbonate (PC) baby bottles. It is thought to be an endocrine disruptor and
has been proven harmful to animals in laboratory experiments, raising concerns
that it could cause negative health effects in humans.</P>
      <P>With health concerns over BPA increasing worldwide in recent years, Canada
announced in April this year its intention to ban the import and sale of PC
bottles containing BPA, making it the first country in the world to take action
on the chemical, Wu pointed out.</P>
      <P>While Japan has placed BPA on its list of possible endocrine disruptors,  the
United States has required the manufacturers, importers and processors of BPA-
made products to submit related information to authorities, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The European Union, meanwhile, has set a limit of 30 ppb for BPA emissions, Wu
said.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, as the metabolic systems of infants and young children are not
as developed as adults, BPA consumption is likely to affect their reproductive
system.</P>
      <P>There have not been any reports of such incidents in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As BPA has not been banned in containers for baby use, Wu urged the public to
avoid putting high-temperature liquids in these containers and discard
containers that have cracked to reduce the risk that the chemical has been
released into the food or beverage being consumed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Natural gas prices should be cut further: Consumers' Foundation</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Natural gas prices in Taiwan should be cut further even after a 2.99 percent
drop announced earlier this week by the the state-run petroleum refiner, CPC
Corp. Taiwan, the Consumers' Foundation suggested Friday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Tien-jen, chairman of the non-profit civil organization, said natural gas
prices should have room for another 40 percent cut to reflect the international
market price.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also suggested that Taiwan follow in the U.S.' footsteps and print the
current international natural gas price on receipts to keep consumers informed.</P>
      <P>CPC on Tuesday announced its first adjustment of domestic natural gas prices
since May 28, dropping the price by 2.99 percent on average. This translated
into a price reduction of between NT$0.24 per cubic meter and NT$1.63 per cubic
meter, depending on the category of natural gas user.</P>
      <P>On May 28, CPC's natural gas price was raised by NT$3.85 per cubic meter from
the average NT$13.46 per cubic meter due to skyrocketing international crude oil
prices.</P>
      <P>The price cut Tuesday, made retroactive to Dec. 1, was the biggest drop in
natural gas prices announced by CPC since it was authorized to adjust prices.
The announcement came as a surprise, as the company had initially said it would
not lower natural gas prices until next month.</P>
      <P>On Friday, CPC officials rebutted media reports that it was about to further
slash natural gas prices by 7 percent, saying they were purely speculative.</P>
      <P>CPC is allowed to adjust the price of natural gas within a range of 3 percent
each month without government permission.</P>
      <P>The company is currently discussing with the relevant authorities whether to
lower the prices further considering that its natural gas department has
recorded an accumulated loss of NT$35 billion (US$1.04 billion) this year due to
import costs outstripping domestic prices, CPC Chairman Wenent Pan said.</P>
      <P>Citing data showing that natural gas futures in New York plunged by 47 percent,
from US$12.977 per MMbtu on July 7 to US$6.92 per MMbtu on Oct. 20, Hsieh said
domestic natural gas prices should be reduced to the pre-May 28 level.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that CPC review its operational performance.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese residents will have a chance to see a super full moon on Dec. 12,
which will be visible in Taiwan at its fullest in 15 years, the Taipei
Astronomical Museum said in a press release Friday.</P>
      <P>The full moon is expected to rise from the east at 4: 31 p.m. Dec. 12 and fall

      <P>The moon will move on its oval orbit around the earth to the spot closest to the
earth -- 356,566 kilometers in distance -- at 6 a.m. Dec. 13.</P>
      <P>For people who miss a chance to see the moon this year, they will have to wait
until Nov. 14, 2016 to see a full moon bigger and brighter than this one, the
museum said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, local sky watchers may also expect the approach of the Geminid meteor
shower next week, which will fly pass the earth at 7 a.m. on Dec. 14.</P>
      <P>The maximum meteor volume will reach 120 units per hour, and the shower will fly
pass at a speed of 35 kilometers per second, according to the city-run museum.</P>
      <P>The meteor shower can be observed between Dec. 7-17, and if the sky is clear,

      <P>With a NT$58.3 billion (US$1.75 billion) infrastructure expansion project in an
economic stimulus package put in place by the central government, local
governments are confident that construction of public works projects in their
area will be launched by the end of this year, Public Construction Commission
Minister Frank Fan said Friday.</P>
      <P>Fan made the remarks at a news conference held following a meeting earlier
Friday with Premier Liu Chao-shiuan. Also present at the meeting were government
officials from 11 local areas, where the launch of public works projects have
lagged behind that of Taiwan's 14 other cities and counties.</P>
      <P>According to Fan, Liu encouraged the local governments to closely cooperate with
the Executive Yuan in completing construction of their projects so as to help
stimulate Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>At present,  an average  72.09 percent of all the public construction projects
nationwide -- 6,733 cases out of a total of 9,340 -- are under construction, Fan
said.</P>
      <P>As of early December, only the offshore Kinmen and Lienchiang counties have
fully launched construction of their 11 and five projects, respectively, Fan
noted.</P>
      <P>However, the 11 local cities and counties -- including Yilan, Hsinchu,  Taitung,
Nantou, Tainan, Kaohsiung, Changhua, Taipei, Yunlin, Pingtung counties and
Chiayi City -- have each failed to reach a 75 percent construction rate, Fan
said.</P>
      <P>Fan pointed out that Pingtung County in southern Taiwan has registered the
lowest rate of 2.45 percent, but deputy magistrate Chung Chia-pin asserted
during the meeting that all the county's public construction projects will be
kicked off by late this month as slated.</P>
      <P>The minister  said that budgets  earmarked  for the local governments to carry
out the task will be returned to the national coffers in due process if they
fail to meet the year-end deadline.</P>
      <P>Later Friday,  Chung clarified  that the Pintung  County's construction rate has
hit 22.34 percent -- or 168 cases under construction out of a total of 752

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) presented Friday new varieties of
rice and cabbage that it said are more environmentally  friendly and more
adaptable to warm temperatures.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Jung-wu, director of the Taichung District Agricultural
Research and Extension Station (TDARES) under the COA, unhusked rice grains
usually have fine spikes called awns attached to them.</P>
      <P>He said that the awns often cause air pollution and cause rice workers to
develop problems such as skin irritations during the milling of the rice. As a
result, during the harvesting period, people living near rice mills have to
close their doors and windows tightly, he added.</P>
      <P>However, after years of effort, the TDARES in central Taiwan has succeeded in
creating Taiwan's first rice variety without awns, he said.</P>
      <P>"Thanks to the new variety, named "Taichung 193, " not only the quality of the
product, but also people's living environment has improved," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Although the crops of the new rice variety in some regions were poor and it is
not very resistant to blight, the research team is working on improvements and
is trying to develop new awn-free varieties, he said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the TDARES has also developed a new variety of cabbage, a common
vegetable in Taiwan, that is more resistant to warm temperatures, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He added that the most popular cabbage variety in Taiwan, which has a market
share of 70 percent, does not thrive well in high temperatures. To meet the
market demand in summer, farmers have been forced to grow cabbages at high
altitudes.</P>
      <P>To solve problems of high prime cost and warmer temperatures, the TDARES in
December 2007 developed the "Taichung 1" cabbage variety that has proved to be
more resistant to high temperatures and is expected to help stabilize cabbage
harvests at low altitudes in late summer, fall and winter, Chen said.</P>

      <P>The Special Investigation Division of the Supreme Prosecutors Office on Friday
listed a college classmate of former first lady Wu Shu-jen as a defendant for
allegedly helping Wu with money laundering, increasing the number of defendants
in the case to 12.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Chen Yun-nan, director of the division, confirmed that his division
had summoned Wu's former classmate Tsai Mei-li for questioning as a defendant in
the case, but said Tsai begged out of the session because she was ill.</P>
      <P>Tsai's two brothers -- Tsai Ming-che and Tsai Ming-chieh -- have already been
listed as defendants in the case for allegedly serving as proxies in helping the
former first family launder money abroad.</P>
      <P>In addition to Wu, three other members of the former first family --  former
President Chen Shui-bian,  son Chen Chih-chung and daughter-in-law Huang Jui-
ching -- have all been listed as chief defendants in the money laundering case.</P>
      <P>Others listed as defendants include the former first lady's elder brother Wu
Ching-mao, his wife Chen Chun-ying, former Mega Financial Holding Co. Chairman
Cheng Shen-chih, Yuanta Securities board member Tu Li-ping, and former
Presidential Office cashier Chen Chen-hui.</P>
      <P>None of those listed as defendants in the case have been indicted on charges
related to money laundering, as at this stage in the investigation they are
still only viewed as suspects.</P>
      <P>Wu Ching-mao was released Nov. 28 on NT$2 million (US$59,580) bail after he had
been held in custody for 53 days to prevent possible collusion among the
defendants and witnesses.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors who examined the information provided by judicial authorities of
Singapore about an account owned by Wu Ching-mao believe they have enough
evidence to suspect that Tsai Mei-li and her brothers helped the former first
lady transfer millions of U. S. dollars illegally to her brother's account with
South Africa's Standard Bank in Singapore through their bank accounts in Hong
Kong.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors found that they money was later wired to a Swiss bank account held
by the son and daughter-in-law of the former president and his wife.</P>
      <P>Before listing Tsai Mei-li as a defendant, the prosecutors questioned her four
times. On Sept. 25, they searched her residence and office for possible
evidence. Her brother Tsai Ming-che has been held in custody since Oct. 2.</P>
      <P>In addition to their alleged violations of laws against money laundering, Chen
Shui-bian and his wife also face investigation on charges of embezzling state
affairs funds of the Presidential Office and accepting bribes during the former
president's two terms between 2000 and 2008.</P>
      <P>With the permission of the Taipei District Court, the Special Investigation
Division has detained the former president since Nov. 12, after interrogating
him for six hours a day earlier.</P>

      <P>An art and culture show featuring China's Nanjing City kicked off in Taipei
County Friday, as part of a cross-strait cultural exchange effort.</P>
      <P>The Taipei county government said the event includes six performances being
staged Friday to Monday by a children's art group, a drama group and a Shaoxing
opera group from Nanjing City.</P>
      <P>In addition, a photo gallery will allow the public to get a sense of Nanjing
City's historical cultures, while a textile show will display the city's famous
Yun Jin (Cloud embroidery) designs and techniques until Dec. 18.</P>
      <P>A weaving machine the height of a two-story building, which was used to make
clothing with the Cloud embroidery design, is on exhibition at County Hall.</P>
      <P>The other events are being staged at the county's cultural center, a county
government official said.</P>
      <P>The show was organized by Taipei County's Cultural Affairs Bureau under a
memorandum of understanding signed by Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei and
Nanjing City Mayor Jiang Hongkun in July to pave the way for exchanges in art,
trade, and agriculture.</P>
      <P>Nanjing City Deputy Mayor Chen Gang said the city has rich cultural resources,
as it has a 2,470-year history and served as the capital of China during six
different dynasties.</P>
      <P>Liu Jien, head of a visiting cultural delegation of about 140 members from
Nanjing City, said the cultural exchanges will help close the gap between the
people on both sides.</P>
      <P>In mid-November, several groups from Taipei County performed in Nanjing City,
the official added.</P>

      <P>The government will spend NT$47 billion (US$1.4 billion) over the next four
years to repair or reinforce run-down school buildings throughout the country,
Minister of Education Cheng Jei-cheng said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, the old school building renovation program will form a
critical part of a major infrastructure construction project designed by the
Executive Yuan to help spur domestic demand amid the current global economic
recession.</P>
      <P>Under the program, 5,250 dilapidated elementary and junior high school
classrooms  and 980 senior and vocational  high school classrooms will be
renovated.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 2,045 other classrooms will be reinforced to enhance their ability to
resist earthquakes.</P>
      <P>Given the government's limited budget, Cheng said, the ministry will appropriate
NT$2.5 billion to repair elementary and junior high school classrooms and
another NT$700 million to revamp senior and vocational high school classrooms in
2009, the first year of the project.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Consumer prices in Taiwan have stabilized and may even be on the decline, as the
consumer price index (CPI) fell month-on-month by 1.08 percent in November and
wholesale prices fell at an even faster clip, the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) reported Friday.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the CPI stood at 106.74 in November, 1.08 percent lower
than in October and 1.88 percent higher than in the same month last year. The
year-on-year rise was the lowest since September 2007, it said.</P>
      <P>The report attributed the latest weakness in prices to declines in crude oil and
grain prices in the international market.</P>
      <P>Reductions in domestic fuel and liquefied natural gas prices, overseas tour
package costs and food products made from wheat and soybean, also steadied
prices last month.</P>
      <P>The wholesale price index (WPI) stood at 104.94 in November, sliding 5.31
percent from the previous month's level and 4.95-percent year-on-year, the first
fall after rising for 36 consecutive months.</P>
      <P>Because of higher inflation earlier in the year, the average WPI in the first 11
months of the year grew by 6.63 percent compared with the same period in 2007,
the DGBAS said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Patients with heart disease in Taiwan should have a checkup as early as possible
to find out whether they have coronary artery disease, a doctor with Chang Gung
Memorial Hospital in Keelung said Friday.</P>
      <P>Wu Kuan-chun, a diagnostic radiologist, pointed out that heart disease is one of
the top 10 causes of death in Taiwan, ranking fourth after cancer, accidents and
chronic liver disease.</P>
      <P>Wu cited statistics as showing that 80 percent of those who died of heart
disease in Taiwan died because of coronary artery stenosis -- the abnormal
constriction of a coronary artery, and that 30 percent of them died after
suffering their first heart attacks.</P>
      <P>As a precautionary measure, patients with heart disease should get a three-
dimensional CT (computed tomography) scan as soon as possible, he said, adding
that the 64-slice computed tomography can have an accuracy rate of 99 percent.</P>
      <P>Coronary artery disease usually begins when hard cholesterol substances, known
as plaques, are deposited within a coronary artery. The plaques in the coronary
arteries can cause a tiny clot to form, which can obstruct the flow of blood to
the heart muscle producing chest pain or trigger a heart attack or sudden death.</P>

      <P>A pair of giant pandas will get speedy customs clearance upon arrival in Taiwan
from China, the Taipei Zoo said Friday.</P>
      <P>Zoo Director Jason Yeh said as soon as the plane carrying the two pandas -- Tuan
Tuan and Yuan Yuan -- lands at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, customs
officials will examine the quarantine papers before giving the green light for
their entry.</P>
      <P>Yeh said a motorcade will escort the two pandas to the zoo, which is expected to
take one hour, to cut the discomfort of their long trip to the minimum.</P>
      <P>An official of the quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) announced a
day earlier that the two pandas will arrive before Christmas.</P>
      <P>SEF Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Kao Koong-lian said the necessary papers
for the pandas' entry are being prepared by the SEF and its China counterpart,
the Association For Relations Across the Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that if the pandas could come before Christmas, then they might make
their debut in front of the public before the Lunar New Year, which falls on
Jan. 26.</P>
      <P>"The SEF and the ARATS have chosen two dates for the delivery prior to Dec. 24,
but have yet to make a final decision," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>He also said the zoo has formed a team, including two senior animal feeding
staff and 18 veterinarians and assistants, to take care of the pandas.</P>
      <P>"After the zoo learns of the exact date of delivery, it will send two animal
feeding staff two weeks in advance to Sichuan to have close contact with the two
pandas," he added.</P>
      <P>This is because the pandas have a sharp sense of smell and the staff would like
to nurture a relationship with the animals to facilitate their care in the zoo.</P>
      <P>The zoo estimates that the two pandas will consume between 40 kilograms and 80
kgs. of bamboo shoots a day, and the zoo is planting more bamboo.</P>
      <P>The zoo will allocate NT$1.02 million annually for the bamboo expenses, he
added.</P>
      <P>China first promised to send the two pandas as a gift to Taiwan during a meeting
between the-then Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and Chinese leader Hu Jintao in
2005.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Beijing urged to approve Amway China employees' Taiwan tour plan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) wrote to its Chinese counterpart Friday
seeking its assistance in pushing the Chinese government to approve a planned
visit to Taiwan next year by Amway China Co.'s management and sales staff.</P>
      <P>Some 13,000 employees  from the U.S.-based  direct selling company's China
operations are set to take a cruise to Taiwan next March, which is expected to
give a badly needed shot in the arm to the island's tourism industry.</P>
      <P>However, Amway's Taiwan subsidiary sought the SEF's help Thursday as the Chinese
government reportedly is unwilling to approve the Amway China staff's travel
plans because the Chinese employees will come from all parts of the country, not
just the designated 13 provinces whose residents are now allowed to make
pleasure trips to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In its message to the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS), the SEF said the Amway China staff will mainly attend an
advanced personnel training camp during their stay in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the SEF said Taiwan is only a stop in the Amway staff's planned
overseas package tour which will also take them to Japan and other destinations.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the SEF said the Amway staff's Taiwan travel plan should
not be subject to the restrictions  of a cross-strait agreement on Chinese
citizens' sightseeing trips to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According  to an accord signed  by the heads of the two quasi-official
intermediary bodies -- SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and ARATS President Chen
Yulin -- in June in Beijing, Taiwan will admit up to 3,000 Chinese tourists per
day and China will allow residents in 13 specified municipalities and provinces
to make pleasure trips to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Stressing  that the Amway group's Taiwan travel plan will contribute
significantly to cross-strait civilian exchanges, the SEF wrote in its letter
that Taiwan has approved the Amway's plan on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>"We look forward to your assistance in coordinating an approval by relevant
mainland agencies as soon as possible to facilitate the smooth proceeding of the
travel plan," the SEF wrote.</P>
      <P>According to the original plan, Amway China employees will visit in several
groups on cruise liners from Shanghai to Keelung Harbor and Taichung Harbor.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF head assures Japan there is no Taiwan-China economic threat</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Dec.  5 (CNA)
12/05/08  22:56:37

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and China are independent economic entities within the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and will not become one economy that could pose a threat to
Japan, Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) chairman, Chiang Pin-kung,
said in Tokyo Friday.</P>
      <P>Although one of President Ma Ying-jeou's policies is to build closer economic
ties and ultimately ink a comprehensive economic cooperation agreement (CECA)
with China, Chiang said, Taiwan and China will not integrate into one economic
entity because they are independent WTO members that each hold negotiations on
an equal footing under the WTO framework.</P>
      <P>"It is a totally different case from that of Hong Kong and China, which signed a
closer economic partnership agreement (CEPA) with each other in line with
Beijing's 'one-country, two systems' formula," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan hopes to boost economic  development  through cooperation with
China, there is no need for Japan to worry about the possibility of a Taiwan-
China economic threat, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Chiang made the remarks during a meeting held at the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Representative Office in Japan to explain to Japanese political figures
and media the recent developments in cross-Taiwan Strait ties.</P>
      <P>The SEF and China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS)
-- the two intermediary bodies in charge of cross-strait negotiations -- have
agreed to deal with practical economic issues before complex political matters,
Chiang said.</P>
      <P>"It would be a long time before Taiwan and China could start political talks, "
he said, adding that "clinching a CECA with China is currently one of Taiwan's
long-term goals."</P>
      <P>Mainland China and Hong Kong absorb about 40 percent of Taiwan's exports, while
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and Japan take some 15 percent and 7
percent, respectively, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the question of whether Taiwan is allowed to take part in the 2009
annual conference of the World Health Assembly in May as an observer will serve
as a test of Taiwan-China relations, which have showed improvements over the
past six months, he said.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan continues to be excluded from the WHA annual meeting due to Beijing's
interference, the Taiwan people will be very hurt," he said.</P>
      <P>Stating that Taiwan is eager to sign a free trade agreement or an economic
partnership agreement with Japan, he called on the Japanese government to
respond soon to Taiwan's overtures.</P>
      <P>Chiang left for Japan Thursday on a three-day visit with the aim of explaining
the recent developments in Taiwan-China relations to Japanese figures and
Taiwanese expatriates  there and to make arrangements for a visit by ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung to Japan next week.</P>
      <P>Japan has long been a close ally of Taiwan in the region.</P>
      <P>Before his departure from Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport Thursday, the SEF
chief noted that Taiwan-China ties have improved significantly since Ma assumed
office in May and that a visit to Taipei last month by ARATS President Chen
Yunlin had further boosted bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese officials have said that the island's closer relations with China will
not jeopardize  Taiwan's relations with other countries, but rather would
benefit the region by fostering peace and stability.</P>
      <P>In a follow-up to their historic encounter in June in Beijing, Chiang and Chen
inked four cooperation pacts during their second meeting in Taipei last month.</P>
      <P>The agreements, slated to take effect from Dec. 15, will allow for the expansion
of direct weekend charter flights between the two sides into a daily service,
and the launch of direct shipping and postal links. An agreement to cooperate on
food safety control was also inked.</P>
      <P>Chiang expressed confidence Thursday that the four pacts will benefit both sides
of the Taiwan Strait, particularly the accords on the establishment of direct
shipping and air travel links.</P>

      <P>The Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC)  will promote cooperation among
small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) in Taiwan, Hong Kong and China to tap
into the vast Chinese market, the head of the council's Taipei office said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Perry Fung made the pledge at a cocktail reception marking the opening of the
HKTDC Taiwan office, which will formally become operational early next year.</P>
      <P>Noting that China already has a middle-class population of 230 million, Fung
said the Chinese consumer market is worth developing and that there is ample
room for SMEs in the three Chinese-speaking societies to cooperate in exploring
such an immense opportunity.</P>
      <P>Senior HKTDC executives also traveled to Taipei to attend the opening reception,
which saw the attendance of many Taiwanese trade promoters and business
managers, including Wang Chih-kang, chairman of the Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA).</P>
      <P>Addressing the occasion, HKTDC Chairman Jack So said capital, commodity and
manpower exchanges among Taiwan, China and Hong Kong will get ever closer in the
future.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, So said the HKTDC decided to open a branch in Taipei to
facilitate further cooperation.</P>
      <P>The HKTDC,  a Hong Kong  government-funded  but unofficial organization, began
considering opening a branch in Taiwan five years ago, but did not file an
application until after the Kuomintang -- seen as more friendly toward China
than the previous Democratic Progressive Party administration -- regained power
in Taiwan in May this year.</P>
      <P>After Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs approved the HKTDC application in
October, the Hong Kong group sent Fung -- formerly the HKTDC Beijing office's
top executive in charge of the northern China market -- to Taipei to prepare for
the opening of the new office.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government has warmly welcomed the HKTDC's decision to establish a
foothold in Taipei as it will facilitate bilateral trade and civic exchanges.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong is Taiwan's fourth- largest trading partner after China, Japan and the
United States.</P>
      <P>According to customs statistics, Taiwan-Hong Kong trade totaled US$39.8 billion
in 2007, accounting for 8.54 percent of Taiwan's overall foreign trade for the
year. Of that amount, Taiwan's exports accounted for US$37.98 billion, or 15.4
percent of the country's total exports for the year, making Hong Kong Taiwan's
second-largest export outlet after China.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Hong Kong invested more than US$200 million in Taiwan, up 76
percent from 2006, while Taiwan's investment in Hong Kong for that year totaled
about US$190 million.</P>
      <P>In the first six months of this year, Hong Kong investment had already topped
US$236 million, far exceeding its investment for the whole of 2007, according to
official Taiwan government tallies.</P>

      <P>The Red Cross Society of the Republic of China signed a post-reconstruction
agreement with its Chinese counterpart in Sichuan province Friday, according to
a press release issued by the society in Taipei.</P>
      <P>C.V. Chen, president of Taiwan's Red Cross Society, signed the agreement with
Jiang Yiman, executive vice president of the Red Cross Society of China, in
Yinxiu township, Wenchuan, one of the hardest hit areas in the May 12 quake.</P>
      <P>Chen earlier visited a mass grave in Yinxiu, which was located at the epicenter
of the magnitude-8.0 earthquake, to pay tribute to tens of thousands of victims
of the devastating temblor.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Red Cross Society arrived in the quake-stricken area with
donations and relief supplies.</P>
      <P>The society intends to spend NT$1.595 billion (US$47.89 million) in remote parts
of Sichuan, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces to rebuild 44 schools, 43 health care
facilities and one rehabilitation center for the disabled in the Aba Tibetan-
Qiang Autonomous Region, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He added that the Red Cross Society will also sponsor schooling for impoverished
children in the affected areas, and work with nonprofit organizations in Taiwan
and China to promote social service programs so as to help the underpriviledged
people in the affected areas return to normal life.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that 32,648 students and more than 1.5 million affected
residents in Sichuan, Gansu and Shaanxi will benefit from the assistance, the
press release said.</P>
      <P>Official figures as of July 21, 2008, put the number of confirmed dead from the
earthquake at 69,227, including 68,636 in Sichuan province. Another 374,176 were
listed as injured, with 18,222 listed as missing.</P>
      <P>The earthquake left about 4.8 million people homeless, according to official
statistics, but that number could be as high as 11 million. Approximately 15
million people lived in the affected area.</P>

approvals and disapprovals of the subjects. When there is no such understanding,
then the good will not be discovered and rewarded and the bad will not be
punished."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>Pandas to get speedy customs clearance: Taipei Zoo</HEADLINE>

      <P>A pair of giant pandas will get speedy customs clearance upon arrival in Taiwan
from China, the Taipei Zoo said Friday.</P>
      <P>Zoo Director Jason Yeh said as soon as the plane carrying the two pandas -- Tuan
Tuan and Yuan Yuan -- lands at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, customs
officials will examine the quarantine papers before giving the green light for
their entry.</P>
      <P>Yeh said a motorcade will escort the two pandas to the zoo, which is expected to
take one hour, to cut the discomfort of their long trip to the minimum.</P>
      <P>An official of the quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) announced a
day earlier that the two pandas will arrive before Christmas.</P>
      <P>SEF Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Kao Koong-lian said the necessary papers
for the pandas' entry are being prepared by the SEF and its China counterpart,
the Association For Relations Across the Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that if the pandas could come before Christmas, then they might make
their debut in front of the public before the Lunar New Year, which falls on
Jan. 26.</P>
      <P>"The SEF and the ARATS have chosen two dates for the delivery prior to Dec. 24,
but have yet to make a final decision," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>He also said the zoo has formed a team, including two senior animal feeding
staff and 18 veterinarians and assistants, to take care of the pandas.</P>
      <P>"After the zoo learns of the exact date of delivery, it will send two animal
feeding staff two weeks in advance to Sichuan to have close contact with the two
pandas," he added.</P>
      <P>This is because the pandas have a sharp sense of smell and the staff would like
to nurture a relationship with the animals to facilitate their care in the zoo.</P>
      <P>The zoo estimates that the two pandas will consume between 40 kilograms and 80
kgs. of bamboo shoots a day, and the zoo is planting more bamboo.</P>
      <P>The zoo will allocate NT$1.02 million annually for the bamboo expenses, he
added.</P>
      <P>China first promised to send the two pandas as a gift to Taiwan during a meeting
between the-then Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and Chinese leader Hu Jintao in
2005.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Beijing urged to approve Amway China employees' Taiwan tour plan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) wrote to its Chinese counterpart Friday
seeking its assistance in pushing the Chinese government to approve a planned
visit to Taiwan next year by Amway China Co.'s management and sales staff.</P>
      <P>Some 13,000 employees  from the U.S.-based  direct selling company's China
operations are set to take a cruise to Taiwan next March, which is expected to
give a badly needed shot in the arm to the island's tourism industry.</P>
      <P>However, Amway's Taiwan subsidiary sought the SEF's help Thursday as the Chinese
government reportedly is unwilling to approve the Amway China staff's travel
plans because the Chinese employees will come from all parts of the country, not
just the designated 13 provinces whose residents are now allowed to make
pleasure trips to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In its message to the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS), the SEF said the Amway China staff will mainly attend an
advanced personnel training camp during their stay in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the SEF said Taiwan is only a stop in the Amway staff's planned
overseas package tour which will also take them to Japan and other destinations.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the SEF said the Amway staff's Taiwan travel plan should
not be subject to the restrictions  of a cross-strait agreement on Chinese
citizens' sightseeing trips to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According  to an accord signed  by the heads of the two quasi-official
intermediary bodies -- SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and ARATS President Chen
Yulin -- in June in Beijing, Taiwan will admit up to 3,000 Chinese tourists per
day and China will allow residents in 13 specified municipalities and provinces
to make pleasure trips to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Stressing  that the Amway group's Taiwan travel plan will contribute
significantly to cross-strait civilian exchanges, the SEF wrote in its letter
that Taiwan has approved the Amway's plan on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>"We look forward to your assistance in coordinating an approval by relevant
mainland agencies as soon as possible to facilitate the smooth proceeding of the
travel plan," the SEF wrote.</P>
      <P>According to the original plan, Amway China employees will visit in several
groups on cruise liners from Shanghai to Keelung Harbor and Taichung Harbor.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF head assures Japan there is no Taiwan-China economic threat</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Dec.  5 (CNA)
12/06/08  13:14:03

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and China are independent economic entities within the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and will not become one economy that could pose a threat to
Japan, Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) chairman, Chiang Pin-kung,
said in Tokyo Friday.</P>
      <P>Although one of President Ma Ying-jeou's policies is to build closer economic
ties and ultimately ink a comprehensive economic cooperation agreement (CECA)
with China, Chiang said, Taiwan and China will not integrate into one economic
entity because they are independent WTO members that each hold negotiations on
an equal footing under the WTO framework.</P>
      <P>"It is a totally different case from that of Hong Kong and China, which signed a
closer economic partnership agreement (CEPA) with each other in line with
Beijing's 'one-country, two systems' formula," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan hopes to boost economic  development  through cooperation with
China, there is no need for Japan to worry about the possibility of a Taiwan-
China economic threat, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Chiang made the remarks during a meeting held at the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Representative Office in Japan to explain to Japanese political figures
and media the recent developments in cross-Taiwan Strait ties.</P>
      <P>The SEF and China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS)
-- the two intermediary bodies in charge of cross-strait negotiations -- have
agreed to deal with practical economic issues before complex political matters,
Chiang said.</P>
      <P>"It would be a long time before Taiwan and China could start political talks, "
he said, adding that "clinching a CECA with China is currently one of Taiwan's
long-term goals."</P>
      <P>Mainland China and Hong Kong absorb about 40 percent of Taiwan's exports, while
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and Japan take some 15 percent and 7
percent, respectively, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the question of whether Taiwan is allowed to take part in the 2009
annual conference of the World Health Assembly in May as an observer will serve
as a test of Taiwan-China relations, which have showed improvements over the
past six months, he said.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan continues to be excluded from the WHA annual meeting due to Beijing's
interference, the Taiwan people will be very hurt," he said.</P>
      <P>Stating that Taiwan is eager to sign a free trade agreement or an economic
partnership agreement with Japan, he called on the Japanese government to
respond soon to Taiwan's overtures.</P>
      <P>Chiang left for Japan Thursday on a three-day visit with the aim of explaining
the recent developments in Taiwan-China relations to Japanese figures and
Taiwanese expatriates  there and to make arrangements for a visit by ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung to Japan next week.</P>
      <P>Japan has long been a close ally of Taiwan in the region.</P>
      <P>Before his departure from Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport Thursday, the SEF
chief noted that Taiwan-China ties have improved significantly since Ma assumed
office in May and that a visit to Taipei last month by ARATS President Chen
Yunlin had further boosted bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese officials have said that the island's closer relations with China will
not jeopardize  Taiwan's relations with other countries, but rather would
benefit the region by fostering peace and stability.</P>
      <P>In a follow-up to their historic encounter in June in Beijing, Chiang and Chen
inked four cooperation pacts during their second meeting in Taipei last month.</P>
      <P>The agreements, slated to take effect from Dec. 15, will allow for the expansion
of direct weekend charter flights between the two sides into a daily service,
and the launch of direct shipping and postal links. An agreement to cooperate on
food safety control was also inked.</P>
      <P>Chiang expressed confidence Thursday that the four pacts will benefit both sides
of the Taiwan Strait, particularly the accords on the establishment of direct
shipping and air travel links.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HKTDC opens branch in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC)  will promote cooperation among
small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) in Taiwan, Hong Kong and China to tap
into the vast Chinese market, the head of the council's Taipei office said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Perry Fung made the pledge at a cocktail reception marking the opening of the
HKTDC Taiwan office, which will formally become operational early next year.</P>
      <P>Noting that China already has a middle-class population of 230 million, Fung
said the Chinese consumer market is worth developing and that there is ample
room for SMEs in the three Chinese-speaking societies to cooperate in exploring
such an immense opportunity.</P>
      <P>Senior HKTDC executives also traveled to Taipei to attend the opening reception,
which saw the attendance of many Taiwanese trade promoters and business
managers, including Wang Chih-kang, chairman of the Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA).</P>
      <P>Addressing the occasion, HKTDC Chairman Jack So said capital, commodity and
manpower exchanges among Taiwan, China and Hong Kong will get ever closer in the
future.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, So said the HKTDC decided to open a branch in Taipei to
facilitate further cooperation.</P>
      <P>The HKTDC,  a Hong Kong  government-funded  but unofficial organization, began
considering opening a branch in Taiwan five years ago, but did not file an
application until after the Kuomintang -- seen as more friendly toward China
than the previous Democratic Progressive Party administration -- regained power
in Taiwan in May this year.</P>
      <P>After Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs approved the HKTDC application in
October, the Hong Kong group sent Fung -- formerly the HKTDC Beijing office's
top executive in charge of the northern China market -- to Taipei to prepare for
the opening of the new office.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government has warmly welcomed the HKTDC's decision to establish a
foothold in Taipei as it will facilitate bilateral trade and civic exchanges.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong is Taiwan's fourth- largest trading partner after China, Japan and the
United States.</P>
      <P>According to customs statistics, Taiwan-Hong Kong trade totaled US$39.8 billion
in 2007, accounting for 8.54 percent of Taiwan's overall foreign trade for the
year. Of that amount, Taiwan's exports accounted for US$37.98 billion, or 15.4
percent of the country's total exports for the year, making Hong Kong Taiwan's
second-largest export outlet after China.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Hong Kong invested more than US$200 million in Taiwan, up 76
percent from 2006, while Taiwan's investment in Hong Kong for that year totaled
about US$190 million.</P>
      <P>In the first six months of this year, Hong Kong investment had already topped
US$236 million, far exceeding its investment for the whole of 2007, according to
official Taiwan government tallies.</P>

      <P>The Red Cross Society of the Republic of China signed a post-reconstruction
agreement with its Chinese counterpart in Sichuan province Friday, according to
a press release issued by the society in Taipei.</P>
      <P>C.V. Chen, president of Taiwan's Red Cross Society, signed the agreement with
Jiang Yiman, executive vice president of the Red Cross Society of China, in
Yinxiu township, Wenchuan, one of the hardest hit areas in the May 12 quake.</P>
      <P>Chen earlier visited a mass grave in Yinxiu, which was located at the epicenter
of the magnitude-8.0 earthquake, to pay tribute to tens of thousands of victims
of the devastating temblor.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Red Cross Society arrived in the quake-stricken area with
donations and relief supplies.</P>
      <P>The society intends to spend NT$1.595 billion (US$47.89 million) in remote parts
of Sichuan, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces to rebuild 44 schools, 43 health care
facilities and one rehabilitation center for the disabled in the Aba Tibetan-
Qiang Autonomous Region, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He added that the Red Cross Society will also sponsor schooling for impoverished
children in the affected areas, and work with nonprofit organizations in Taiwan
and China to promote social service programs so as to help the underpriviledged
people in the affected areas return to normal life.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that 32,648 students and more than 1.5 million affected
residents in Sichuan, Gansu and Shaanxi will benefit from the assistance, the
press release said.</P>
      <P>Official figures as of July 21, 2008, put the number of confirmed dead from the
earthquake at 69,227, including 68,636 in Sichuan province. Another 374,176 were
listed as injured, with 18,222 listed as missing.</P>
      <P>The earthquake left about 4.8 million people homeless, according to official
statistics, but that number could be as high as 11 million. Approximately 15
million people lived in the affected area.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has expressed the hope that an upcoming visit by the head
of his ruling party to Japan will help strengthen the friendship and mutual
trust between Taiwan and Japan, according to a statement released Saturday by
the Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Also, Ma has suggested that the two sides deal with their possible future
differences in a rational and peaceful manner, just as they did in handling a
collision between boats of the two coutries that occurred near the disputed
Tiaoyutai Islands a few months ago.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung is scheduled to depart for Japan Sunday for a week-
long visit, during which he will meet with leaders of major political parties in
Japan and several senior politicians who have assumed important government
positions.</P>
      <P>Wu said in the statement that President Ma is attaching great importance to the
trip and has asked the KMT chairman to pass on some messages to the Japanese
side.</P>
      <P>Among those messages, Ma said he understands the importance of Taiwan-Japan
relations and looks forward to further reinforcement of this area.</P>
      <P>Describing Taiwan-Japan ties as a "special partnership," Ma noted that Taiwan
and Japan are very close to each other geographically, share many common
interests and have deep historical links, with bilateral trade amounting to
US$60 billion and more than 2.5 million visitors traveling between the countries
per year.</P>
      <P>Ma said he hopes Japan will realize that the KMT administration's recent efforts
to improve relations with China do not run counter to its bid to enhance ties
with Japan and should not be mistaken as a tilt toward Beijing, because the
tempering of the cross-Taiwan Strait crisis is consistent with regional and
global interests.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's bid to take part in international organizations, Ma said he hopes
Japan, which has expressed support for observer status for Taiwan in the World
Health Organization, will offer its assistance to the country in this regard.</P>
      <P>He urged Japan to understand the Taiwan people's strong desire for more
international space and their need for security, peace and dignity.</P>
      <P>On the sovereignty dispute over the Tiaoyutai Islands in the East China Sea, Ma
said he has always insisted that all concerned parties should seek to resolve
the dispute rationally and peacefully.</P>
      <P>When China has been able to put aside its differences with Taiwan over the
sovereignty issue and Japan has been able to cooperate with China to explore oil
resources in the East China sea, Ma said he sees no reason why Taiwan and Japan
cannot shelve their differences to pursue their common interests.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the president said he hopes Japan will offer more conveniences to
Taiwan's people in the future, after previously granting Taiwanese citizens
visa-free entry and the two sides mutually recognizing each other's driver's
licenses.</P>

      <P>The European Chamber of Commerce Taipei (ECCT) re-elected Philippe Pellegrin as
chairman of its board of directors Friday at its annual general meeting.</P>
      <P>Pellegrin, who has been on the ECCT board for three years, serving as treasurer
in his first year and chairman this year, acclaimed 2008 as one of the group's
best years ever.</P>
      <P>The ECCT saw "a record in membership growth and some major lobbying issues
resolved, such as cross-strait direct flights, Taiwan joining the Government
Procurement Agreement, and lifting restrictions on China shares,he said.</P>
      <P>In 2008, ECCT membership increased by 22 member companies and 50 individual
members to a record high of 702 individual members in 2008, Pellegrin said, and
the group also was able to organize meetings with government officials at all
levels.</P>
      <P>"With increased membership, the ECCT also expanded its staff, hiring dedicated
committee officers for the ECCT's Asset Management, Banking, and Insurance
committees, " said Pellegrin, the senior country officer of Calyon Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The chamber, he noted, also successfully completed a study to assess the impact
of a possible EU-Taiwan trade enhancement measures agreement that received the
support of Taiwan's government and European industry federations.</P>
      <P>Pellegrin said he expects 2009 to be a very challenging year for the chamber
given the global economic recession and its impact on Taiwan, but he stressed
the chamber is resilient and well prepared for the difficult times ahead.</P>
      <P>He indicated that the new board will hit the ground running next week when ECCT
members meet with Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming to discuss how
European companies can work with the government to stimulate Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>With US$25 billion in direct foreign investment here, Europeans remain the

      <P>Through a network of 28 industry and support committees, the ECCT has been
successful in addressing specific concerns and providing concrete
recommendations to European businesses in Taiwan and to all levels of the Taiwan

      <P>Travel between downtown and the Taipei City Zoo by bus will take twice as long
as going by Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) train, the Taipei city government reminded
local residents Saturday, when service on the Muzha MRT line was suspended for
tests.</P>
      <P>Starting  today,  the metro line will be closed on seven consecutive weekends
until Jan. 18 to allow for testing of the integration of the Muzha line and the
newly built Neihu line, which is scheduled to begin operations in June as an
extension of the Muzha line.</P>
      <P>Service will be suspended on Dec. 6, 7, 13, 14, 20, 21, 27, and 28 as well as
the first four days of January and Jan. 11 and 18.</P>
      <P>The system will be operating on Jan. 10 and 17, which are make-up days for the
extended New Year's holiday.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Rapid Transit Corp. (TRTC) will offer free buses at all Muzha MRT
stations as an alternative to help riders overcome the inconvenience caused by
the temporary halt in services.</P>
      <P>The company reminded passengers, however, to leave themselves more time for the
bus ride because it will take longer than traveling by MRT.</P>
      <P>Going from Zhongshan Junior High School Station to the Taipei Zoo Station, which
normally takes 25 minutes on the MRT, will take nearly double that by bus, which
is subject to a speed limit of 40 kilometers per hour.</P>
      <P>"It takes far too long! " complained a free bus passenger.</P>
      <P>As of noon Saturday, about 10,000 people had used the free bus service, the
Taipei City Department of Transportation estimated.</P>
      <P>TRTC Statistics show that 100,000 people on average use the Muzha MRT line every
weekday and 70,000 people ride it on weekends.</P>
      <P>According to the city department, the free bus service will follow two different
routes, with the first riding on Jungong Road and the other following Xinhai
Road.</P>
      <P>Buses will run between 6 a.m. and 12 p.m. at an interval of one-to-two minutes
at peak times and five-to 10-minutes during non-peak hours.</P>
      <P>They only stop at MRT stations.</P>
      <P>For more detailed information on the transportation situation, local residents

    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of four of 42 toy products recently sampled by the Consumers' Foundation
were found to have labeling that was not up to standard, while a fifth product
was discovered to contain excess amounts of heavy metals, the foundation said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Three of the four improperly  labeled  toy products  were manufactured in China,
while the toy containing the heavy metals lead and chromium in excess of safety
standards also originated in China, according to the foundation.</P>
      <P>The foundation worked with the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Bureau of
Standards, Metrology and Inspection in conducting the testing on the products
from markets and toy stores around Taiwan during November.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Tien-jen, chairman of the foundation, said the testing was carried out
ahead of the Christmas holiday shopping season to ensure consumers' safety.</P>
      <P>The four toys that didn't meet labeling standards had packaging that did not
include the manufacturer's address or the age groups to which they apply.</P>
      <P>The fifth toy was found to contain 813 milligrams per kilogram of lead, well
above the maximum allowable level of 90 mg/kg, as well as 169 mg/kg of chromium,
exceeding the maximum prescribed safety level of 60 mg/kg.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that the maximum allowable limits are in place because both
substances are toxic, noting that if a child accidentally ingests a toy
containing lead, this could severely harm his nervous system, while ingesting
chromium can damage the respiratory and digestive systems.</P>
      <P>He added that according to the Commodity Inspection  Act, companies that are
informed that one of their products is substandard can be fined between
NT$100,000 (US$2,980) and NT$1 million if they do not rectify the problem within
a prescribed period of time.</P>
      <P>He further said the law also stipulates that manufacturers must immediately
remove products containing excess levels of lead or chromium from their store
shelves and destroy the items as these substances pose a serious health hazard
to children.</P>

    <DATELINE>12/06/08  18:15:03</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A plunging stock market, increasing reports of business closures and a climbing
unemployment rate. Taiwan is experiencing its worst economic recession in recent
years and seeing a sudden surge in the number of people in need of social
assistance.</P>
      <P>But at a time when demand for social services is on the rise, many local charity
groups are struggling to cope, their budgets eroded by declining donations from
the hard-hit business community and individuals.</P>
      <P>In the second half of the year in particular, an average of 200 regular donors
per month have halted their donations either because of unemployment, pay cuts
or stock investment losses.</P>
      <P>"This is a problem we've never encountered before. We need to figure out some
ways to work it out, " observed Lin Wen-pin, head of the resource development
division of the Eden Social Welfare Foundation.</P>
      <P>The foundation, which serves some 6,000 physically disabled people, counts on
donations for one-third of its operating budget. But such donations have
decreased by nearly 30 percent so far this year.</P>
      <P>World Vision Taiwan, meanwhile, has seen one-third of the group's sponsors
suspend their donations since October, with receipts during the first 11 months
of this year down 25 percent from the same period a year earlier.</P>
      <P>Hank Du, director of the relief organization, said the depth of the global
financial storm has made soliciting donations particularly challenging.</P>
      <P>The results of recent surveys conducted by several online employment brokers
suggest that 100,000 Taiwanese businesses are likely to lay off workers at the
end of the year, and that 90 percent of salaried workers have suffered
investment losses equal to six months' pay or more.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 27 percent of workers have had their salaries cut, and 20 percent
either are going to be or have been dismissed.</P>
      <P>"If all these figures are correct, 25 percent to 30 percent of our existing
sponsors and donations will be affected," Du said.</P>
      <P>Weng Huei-yuan, director of the social resources department of the Taiwan Fund
for Children and Families (TFCF) , said small donations -- the group's main
source of income -- have decreased by approximately 20 percent since the May 12
Sichuan earthquake in China, which drew an outpouring of donations from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Our financial aid for disadvantaged students alone requires NT$80 million
(US$2.4 million) per year. A decrease of 20 percent means a shortfall of more
than NT$10 million, which makes a very big difference, " Weng said.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the Genesis Social Welfare Foundation, which serves patients in a
persistent vegetative state, began to suffer a decline in donations in May, and
the donations received in June and July dropped by 20 percent from the same
months of last year.</P>
      <P>The Zenan Homeless Social Welfare Foundation is probably the hardest-hit, having
lost 40 percent of its donations so far this year.</P>
      <P>To overcome declining revenues, both Genesis and Zenan have been collecting
retail receipts -- which are used as lottery tickets -- as a source of funds,
but even these funds are drying up as more social groups compete for the
resources.</P>
      <P>There have even been increasing reports of theft of boxes set up by the groups
to collect the receipts, owing to the bad economy.</P>
      <P>Wu Wan-lan, head of Zenan's social resources division, said that besides a
20-percent fall in lottery winnings from the receipts, the quantity of used
winter clothing donated by the public has also decreased this year.</P>
      <P>Amid dwindling resources, the demand for help is rising as an increasingly
larger number of people are left unemployed.</P>
      <P>While the nine food pantries set up by Zenan around Taiwan have served an
average of 300 vagrants per day in the past, the number has doubled recently to
600 people per day, Wu said.</P>
      <P>With a huge turnout expected at this year's annual year-end dinner, Zenan is
planning to serve food at a total of 1,200 tables around Taiwan, a significant
expansion from last year when 400 tables were served, Wu said.</P>
      <P>However, the foundation has raised only NT$2 million for the dinner so far, far
short of the NT$12 million needed, she said.</P>
      <P>Because of the growing difficulties in soliciting donations, applications for
subsidies filed by local social groups with United Way Taiwan (UWT) this year
have requested a record high of NT$660 million.</P>
      <P>The donations received by the fundraiser, meanwhile, are slipping as well.</P>
      <P>According to UWT President Edward Way, the amount of each fixed donation
directed to the UWT averaged just NT$525 in the first half of this year, down
NT$102 from 2007, while the average amount of single, one-time donations has
dropped from NT$806 in 2004 to NT$706 this year.</P>
      <P>In August alone, total donations received were down NT$10 million from the same
month last year, Way said.</P>
      <P>Facing this reduction in resources, social groups are adopting various cost-
saving measures, such as cutting back on electricity use and using video
conferencing to avoid travel.</P>
      <P>Many of them are also calling on the public to donate supplies and used
products.</P>
      <P>And now, the shopping vouchers that the government is scheduled to issue to the
public next month to stimulate consumption are raising the hopes of social
groups for new income, as higher-income earners are being encouraged to donate
their vouchers to charity.</P>
      <P>That may not be enough, however, to ensure the survival of many social groups,
especially those less well-known to the public.</P>
      <P>The League of Social Welfare Organizations in Taiwan and the League of Taipei
Social Welfare have suspended their operations, after recently dismissing their
workers and entrusting the custody of their organizations to other groups
temporarily.</P>
      <P>The government, ironically, is more part of the problem than of the solution.
Many organizations contracted by local government authorities to execute various
social assistance projects are owed subsidies ranging from NT$100,000 to NT$10
million.</P>
      <P>Those debts forced them to petition the Control Yuan for help in August and has
led them to consider  turning down government cooperation projects in the
future, a future that for many social groups and the people they serve is likely
to remain as challenging as the economy itself.</P>

      <P>Cross-Taiwan Strait relations must be based on the principle of respect for each
other's sovereignty in order to ensure that Taiwan's interests  and national
security are not compromised, a private think tank leader said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Michael Tsai, board chairman for the Institute for Taiwan Defense and Strategic
Studies, made the remarks at the 2nd Asia-Pacific 5 Summit on Democracy and
Regional Security held by the institute at the Splendor Kaohsiung hotel in the
southern port city.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that Taiwan has been subject to China's military threat as well as
diplomatic suppression in the international arena for many years.</P>
      <P>If China can accelerate its process of democratization, the hope of peaceful co-
existence in cross-strait relations can be realized, he said, adding that
China's democratization will not only affect the future path of cross-strait
ties but also of regional peace and stability.</P>
      <P>Tsai noted that the increase in frequency of exchanges between Taiwan and China
in recent months has raised concerns among many scholars who he said feel that
the policies of President Ma Ying-jeou's administration have been leaning too
much toward China and could pose a threat to Taiwan's national security and
interests.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Tsai said that although he is optimistic about the strengthening of
exchanges between Taiwan and China, he also hopes relations can proceed based on
the principles of respect for each other's sovereignty, equal footing, the
common pursuit of peace and the establishment  of a regional  security  and
joint defense cooperation mechanism in order to ensure Taiwan's security and
interests.</P>
      <P>Participants in the summit also included Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng,
who delivered a speech at the opening, as well as Luo Fu-chuan, Taiwan's former
representative to Japan, former South Korean Defense Minister Kim Dong-shin, and
representatives from Singapore and Japan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Green activists hold parade to call attention to global warming</HEADLINE>

      <P>Hundreds of environmentalists from around Taiwan held a parade Saturday on the
International Day of Action on Climate Change to urge political leaders to take
concrete actions in fighting global warming.</P>
      <P>Dubbed "Climate change, Taiwan cares! , " the parade began at Liberty Square and
winded its way to Daan Forest Park, where a concert of indigenous singers and
underground bands was held.</P>
      <P>Students and members of a dozen nongovernment environmental organizations
marched in costumes bearing the likenesses of polar bears or other endangered
animals as they urged the government to realize its promise to reduce Taiwan's
greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      <P>They demanded that the authorities tax carbon dioxide emissions and force
enterprises to take greater responsibility  for the pollution.</P>
      <P>Pan Han-shen, secretary-general of the Green Party Taiwan, said that some of
President Ma Ying-jeou's policies are contrary to his promise of reducing carbon
dioxide and saving energy.</P>
      <P>He cited the government's recent decision to distribute shopping vouchers to
every citizen to boost consumption, and the preparation of a budget for the
controversial expressway connecting Suao and Hualien in eastern Taiwan, even
though the plan was shelved earlier this year.</P>
      <P>The construction plan, which critics contend is not necessary and will harm the
environment, was rejected by the environmental impact assessment panel under the
Environmental Protection Administration in April.</P>
      <P>He also blasted the government for offering subsidies to car owners who replace
an old car with a new one.</P>
      <P>Other participants who rode their bicycles in the parade claimed their right to
the road, saying that the increasing number of bicycle commuters needed
"environmental justice."</P>
      <P>The marchers also encouraged people to eat more vegetables and foods produced
locally, rather than to consume imported foods and meat that produce unnecessary
carbon dioxide emissions during the production and transportation process.</P>
      <P>"Less meat and more vegetables are beneficial to people's health and can help
the Earth cool down, " said a representative of an alliance that promotes
vegetarianism.</P>
      <P>The alliance cited figures showing that livestock production is responsible for
18 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      <P>According to the environmentalists, Taiwan's total greenhouse gas emissions
account for 1 percent of the world's total,  with temperatures in the country
rising twice as fast as the global average.</P>
      <P>The Dec. 6 International Day of Action on Climate Change is a day for
communities to express their concern over climate change and, in doing so, call
on world leaders to take urgent action.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ITRI touts Taiwan's role in fighting hepatitis at seminar</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 6 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) on Saturday touted the
advances it has made in developing herbal medications to fight hepatitis B and
C, on the first day of a two-day international symposium on hepatitis and liver
disease being held in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the 2008 International Symposium on Chronic Hepatitis and Liver
Diseases held by the ITRI, Liou Jhong-jheng, the director of ITRI's Biomedical
&amp; Engineering Research Laboratories, said the organization had developed two
drugs in recent years that showed promise in fighting hepatitis.</P>
      <P>One is a Chinese herbal drug for the human hepatitis B virus called BMEC-101,
which ITRI said is even effective on viruses that have developed resistance to
the popular anti-hepatitis B drug Lamivudine.</P>
      <P>Another drug given the code CATC 701,  whose rights were transferred to
PhytoHealth, Ltd. in March 2008 for commercialization, fights hepatitis C by
boosting the amount of interferon in the body, effectively hampering the cell-
based response of hepatitis C viruses, according to Liou.</P>
      <P>These developments were part of a concerted effort to find herbal solutions to
liver disease.</P>
      <P>The ITRI has actively promoted Chinese herbal medicines and new botanical drugs
to fight hepatitis in recent years and dedicated itself to the research and
development of new botanical drugs for liver diseases, " Liou said.</P>
      <P>This research has led to other achievements, such as setting up a filtration
platform and active evaluation models for hepatitis C.</P>
      <P>In addition, the ITRI has set up a standard operating procedure (SOP) for
technical documents related to investigational new drugs, that has helped Taiwan
assume a globally indispensable role in developing Chinese herbs and botanical
drugs in the field, " Liou said.</P>
      <P>ITRI's efforts are just part of the overall battle the country has waged against
hepatitis,  which is particularly  pervasive throughout Asia and in Taiwan,
where up to 20 percent of the population is thought to carry the hepatitis B and
2 percent to 4 percent may carry the hepatitis C virus.</P>
      <P>Liou said Taiwan has had many successes in hepatitis research and produced a
number of top clinical research talents, and it hopes to link up with the rest
of the world to make further advances.</P>
      <P>Through this symposium on hepatitis, we wish to increase the opportunities  for
international  collaboration,  accelerating connections between domestic studies
and global research," Liou said.</P>
      <P>He said the commercial  opportunities  related to treating hepatitis C were
substantial, estimated at US$6 billion per year.</P>
      <P>For the two-day symposium, the ITRI invited many international leading experts
and authorities, including more than 100 doctors, experts,  and pharmaceutical
companies,  to discuss the latest therapies for hepatitis C and the current
status of prevention, treatment, and future research direction for the virus.</P>
      <P>Hepatitis C is a blood-borne infectious disease that is often asymptomatic, but
once established, chronic infection can cause inflammation of the liver (chronic
hepatitis).</P>
      <P>This condition can progress to scarring of the liver (fibrosis) , and advanced
scarring (cirrhosis) . In some cases, those with cirrhosis will go on to develop
liver failure or other complications of cirrhosis, including liver cancer.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH said it will take into consideration WHO's TDI for melamine</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The World Health Organization (WHO) has set a tolerable daily intake (TDI)
standard for melamine at 0.2 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, which
Taiwan's Department of Health (DOH) said Saturday it will take into
consideration in the future when establishing a TDI suitable for people in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Melamine is a contaminant that should not be in food. However, sometimes it is
unavoidable, " acknowledged international experts at a recent meeting held in
Ottawa, Canada, Dec. 1-4 to establish the new standard.</P>
      <P>Based on this, a person weighting 50 kilograms can tolerate an amount of 10 mg
of melamine per day, according to the WHO.</P>
      <P>This is the first time that the WHO announced tolerable levels for melamine, a
toxic industrial chemical that may cause kidney stones and other kidney disease.</P>
      <P>Currently, baby formula, milk powder and creamers in Taiwan must test negative
for melamine when tested by the highly sensitive liquid chromatography/tandem
mass (LC/MS/MS) spectrometers, which can detect the presence of as little as
0.05 ppm of melamine in a substance.</P>
      <P>But the DOH did not establish a TDI, which represents the tolerable amount of
unavoidable contaminant in the food that a person can ingest on a daily basis
without health risk.</P>
      <P>"WHO's suggestion (on TDI for melamine) is important for us. But to set up a TDI
in Taiwan, we need to take into consideration Taiwan people's eating habits,
background levels of melamine and quantity of food consumption, " said DOH
spokesman Wang Je-chau.</P>
      <P>According to the WHO, the TDI is meant to help national authorities set safe
limits in food for withdrawal purposes should melamine be detected as a result
of intentional adulteration.</P>
      <P>"We expect this could better guide the authorities in protecting the health of
their public, " said WHO Director for Food Safety, Jorgen Schlundt, at the close
of the WHO Expert Meeting.</P>
      <P>The WHO Expert Meeting to review toxicological aspects of melamine and cyanuric
acid, held in Ottawa, Canada, was attended by 21 international experts,
including Kang Jaw-jou, professor of the Graduate Institute of Toxicology of the
National Taiwan University.</P>
      <P>Milk products imported from China have caused serious panic in Taiwan since
September, as many foods, such as pre-mixed beverages, biscuits and creamers,
were found to be contaminated with melamine due to Chinese food ingredients.</P>
      <P>The DOH has announced overall bans on import of Chinese milk powder, vegetable-
based proteins, ammonium bicarbonateVa leavening agent -- and protein powder.</P>
      <P>At present, at least 19 local food ingredient importers and companies have
expressed an intent to demand compensation from China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA pleased to see partial settlement of boat collision dispute</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is gratified to see a settlement between
the skipper of a Taiwanese recreational fishing boat and the Japan Coast Guard
(JCG) over a collision dispute near the Tiaoyutai Islands in June this year, an
official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Henry Chen was responding to Japanese media reports that the JCG
has agreed to pay NT$10.5 million (US$312,500) in damages to Ho Hung-yi, skipper
of the Lienho recreational fishing boat that sank some six nautical miles
southwest of the Tiaoyutais June 10 after being hit by a Japanese coast guard
patrol vessel.</P>
      <P>"We are glad to see the positive development in seeking a final solution to the
incident, " Chen said, adding that the MOFA looks forward to continued Japanese
efforts to resolve compensation claims from the passengers and crewmen of the
ill-fated ship.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, three lawyers retained by Ho came to terms with two lawyers
representing the JCJ Friday after several months of intense negotiations over
compensation for the skipper of the sunken vessel.</P>
      <P>Ho said that although he was not fully satisfied with the amount, but he could
not but accept it.</P>
      <P>The Lienho sank after it collided with a JCG patrol vessel that was trying to
chase it away from the disputed Tiaoyutai waters. Ho and his two crew members
were detained by Japanese authorities for questioning after they and 13
Taiwanese recreational fishermen onboard were rescued by the JCG officers.</P>
      <P>The 13 anglers returned to Taiwan June 11 and two crewmen returned June 12,
while Ho, the last to be released, returned June 13.</P>
      <P>The incident caused tensions between Taiwan and Japan, which thawed only after
the JCG offered a formal apology to Ho June 20.</P>
      <P>Negotiations for compensation terms got underway in August and culminated in an
agreement Friday.</P>
      <P>But the two sides need to negotiate further on compensation to the two other
crewmen and 13 fishermen aboard the Lienho.</P>
      <P>The uninhabited Tiaoyutai Islands in the East China Sea are claimed by Taiwan,
Japan and China.</P>
      <P>The conflicting claims over the sovereignty of Tiaoyutais have complicated
fishing disputes between Taiwan and Japan in waters near the islands.</P>
      <P>Both sides held the 15th round of fishery talks in July 2005 to try to resolve
persistent disputes, and both sides agreed to hold the next round of talks in
March 2006, but the talks never took place.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese fishing boats are often chased away by Japanese patrol vessels in the
disputed waters, but collisions there are rare.</P>

      <P>Graduates of local medical schools have complained recently about the challenges
they face from Taiwanese graduates of foreign medical schools, but Department of
Health (DOH) Minister Yeh Ching-chuan said Saturday the problem can only be
resolved by revising the law.</P>
      <P>Users of the Chinese-language Ptt Web site launched a debate earlier this year
over a local hospital's hiring of Taiwanese graduates from medical schools in
Poland and the Philippines as resident doctors in its emergency ward and
surgical department.</P>
      <P>The posters argued that some Polish medical schools have low admission
thresholds for applicants, and have attracted an increasing number of Taiwanese
students who could not gain admission to local medical schools because they
failed tough entrance examinations.</P>
      <P>With the Polish medical degree, the graduates are allowed to participate in
Taiwan's national examinations to acquire a general physician's certification,
with which they can apply for a job in local medical institutions.</P>
      <P>Ptt users complained that the foreign degree holders were paid at a low wage of
NT$50,000 (US$1,487) a month to serve in the surgical department, and this
"cheap labor force" has posed a threat to physicians with local degrees in the
employment market,  they criticized.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an anonymous physician serving at a hospital in central Taiwan
recently sent a letter to the DOH minister's online mailbox criticizing the
system.</P>
      <P>The letter said that under Taiwan's  existing  regulations governing licensed
physicians, foreign medical degree holders are entitled to participate in the
national examination without having to pass a much more challenging screening of
their academic performance by the Ministry of Education.</P>
      <P>Having those physicians serve on medical front lines could jeopardize the
country's medical treatment quality or even risk the precious life of patients,
the physician argued.</P>
      <P>In response to the complaint, DOH officials responsible for medical affairs
admitted that the current law recognizes academic degrees offered by "developed
countries and areas, " including the United States, Japan, Europe, Canada, South
Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>After Poland joined the European Union in 2004, many Taiwanese students pursuing
a medical degree in the Philippines transferred to schools there, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>Although the DOH does not want to recognize the degrees and hopes to insist that
the degree holders get practical training at local clinics and hospitals, and
pass an academic screening before they can take the national physician
certification examination, the decision can't be carried out without having the
law amended, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>The academic services-oriented Web site touts itself as an open and free place
for students to exchange views and ideas in their professional fields through a
bulletin board system.</P>

      <P>Snow fell Saturday on the South Cross-Island Highway that bridges the western
and eastern parts of southern Taiwan -- a region that normally features a marine
tropical climate.</P>
      <P>The snowfall lasted for three hours, beginning at 10 a.m., on the highway
section between Siangyang and Daguanshan, said a vendor surnamed Pan who sells
tempura in Daguanshan at 2,700 meters above sea level.</P>
      <P>Pan said she observed flurries at around 5 a.m. before the snowfall turned heavy
five hours later and continued for three hours. She expected it would snow again
later in the day.</P>
      <P>Many residents in nearby areas flocked to the Daguanshan as early as Friday
night in anticipation of seeing snow after cold rain fell in Taitung the
previous day.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is currently under the influence of a cold air mass from China. The
Central Weather Bureau issued a low-temperature report Saturday, which predicted
that temperatures along the northeastern coast and areas north of Chiayi County

    <HEADLINE>Young people should learn to share by volunteering: president</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou encouraged the country's young generation Saturday to
develop a philosophy focused on "sharing" through volunteering, which he said
would not only influence themselves and those in need, but also help forge
global friendships for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the inaugural meeting of the Regional Peace Volunteer Group as the
group's honorary leader, Ma said that by serving as volunteers, people can help
the underprivileged while learning to adapt to challenges.</P>
      <P>Ma suggested that young people volunteer to share their time, wealth, health or
life, such as making donations of money, blood or even organs, all of which he
said will have an impact on their own lives and those of the beneficiaries.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Ma made particular mention of Taiwan's remote towns and villages
and encouraged young people to contribute to the deprived areas.</P>
      <P>He suggested offering computer training to children there, which he said would
not only narrow the digital gap between cities and towns but also change the
lives of the children.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ma said Taiwan ranked among the top public welfare countries in the
world. Over 10 percent of the population has donated blood, and the number of
the country's volunteers in 2006 ranked fourth in the world and surpassed
100,000 in 2007 alone, the president said.</P>
      <P>He also mentioned initiatives launched by World Vision Taiwan to adopt poor
children in the world, as well as global disaster relief efforts by the Buddhist
Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, saying that all these acts of good will
"naturally" spread Taiwan's image, reputation and power, and helped bridge
friendships between Taiwan and the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, he will urge the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to launch more
programs with a focus on humanitarian relief instead of " checkbook diplomacy, "
in which Taiwan has tried to lure China's diplomatic allies to switch diplomatic

    <HEADLINE>DPP-TSU civic meeting on national affairs slated for early 2009</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 6 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) announced Saturday their plan to jointly hold a civic conference on
national affairs in early 2009 to discuss the economic, social and political
issues faced by the country.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said the conference will be comprised of two
sessions, to take place before and after the Chinese New Year holidays in late
January.</P>
      <P>While the session slated before the holidays will focus on the financial and
economic situation and assistance for disadvantaged citizens, the one to be held
after the holidays will address social reforms and possible changes to the
government system, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>An organizing committee formed by prestigious social elites will be set up by
mid-December, she said.</P>
      <P>On whether former President Lee Teng-hui -- the TSU's spiritual leader -- will
attend the conference, TSU Chairman Huang Kun-huei said the matter will be
decided by the organizing committee, which will be responsible for producing a
list of potential participants.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the main purpose of the conference will be to address
Taiwan's current economic problem to help the country through the crisis.</P>
      <P>Accusing President Ma Ying-jeou of failing to set a clear direction in which he
is leading the country after being in office for half a year, Huang said "strong
sunlight" is now needed to bring Taiwan out of the "dark clouds looming over the
country."</P>
      <P>Agreeing with Huang, Tsai said with public resentment toward the Kuomintang
administration mounting, the opposition should play the role of agenda setter
and serve as a platform for the integration of public opinion.</P>
      <P>The mechanism will ensure the people's voices are heard by the government and
help complement the checks and balances in the government, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Asked if she has any plans to accept President Ma's offer for a meeting with
her, Tsai said she has no intention of doing so because she has no idea what to
discuss with the president.</P>
      <P>However, Tsai said if the upcoming conference comes up with a substantive
conclusion or a direction for national development, she will be "very happy to
hold talks with President Ma" bringing along the conclusion.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Tsai's remarks, an anonymous source in the KMT said Tsai's
reaction to Ma's proposal shows that she is evading dialogue with him.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi, meanwhile, said Ma has raised the
proposal because he believes direct dialogue with Tsai can help sort out
differences between the ruling and opposition parties over major issues.</P>
      <P>Wang said the civic conference being planned by the DPP and TSU is unnecessary
because the Legislative Yuan already serves as a supervisory mechanism of the
government.</P>

      <P>Ma Ju-long, a veteran Taiwanese actor, was named Best Supporting Actor at the
45th Golden Horse Awards, considered the Oscars of Chinese-language films.</P>
      <P>Ma was honored for his outstanding  portrayal of a local politician in "Cape No.
7," a Taiwanese romantic comedy that has been a smash at the local box office.</P>
      <P>Another Taiwanese movie star, Mei Fang, won the best supporting actress award,
for her moving performance in the grown-up film "Orzboyz."</P>
      <P>Suming Chiang, an Amis aboriginal musician, clinched the coveted Best New
Performer award, for his brilliant performance in the film "Hopscotch."</P>
      <P>Chiang said the award came as a big surprise to him. "I'm very lucky to be able
to win in this 'lovely race' with a beautiful Japanese lady and a 'national
treasure,'" an emotional Chiang said at the presentation ceremony.</P>
      <P>The lead singer of a pop band beat two performers in the top grossing "Cape
No.7" -- the film's leading actress Chie Tanaka of Japan and Johnny C.J. Lin,
known as "national treasure" Mao Po in the film.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, "Cape No.7" captured two music awards -- the Best Original Film Score
and the Best Original Song -- with its pleasing music and lyrical theme song
"South of the Border." Composers Fred Lu and Lo Chi-yi said they appreciate
ideas and concepts offered by the film's director, Wei Te-sheng, in the course
of their music making.</P>
      <P>The annual Golden Horse Awards are styled on the U.S. Academy Awards but are
decided by a jury along with the lines of the Cannes film festival.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong film "The Warlords, " with martial arts star Jet Li, leads this year's

      <P>Snow fell Saturday on the South Cross-Island Highway that bridges the western
and eastern parts of southern Taiwan -- a region that normally features a marine
tropical climate.</P>
      <P>The snowfall lasted for three hours, beginning at 10 a.m., on the highway
section between Siangyang and Daguanshan, said a vendor surnamed Pan who sells
tempura in Daguanshan at 2,700 meters above sea level.</P>
      <P>Pan said she observed flurries at around 5 a.m. before the snowfall turned heavy
five hours later and continued for three hours. She expected it would snow again
later in the day.</P>
      <P>Many residents in nearby areas flocked to the Daguanshan as early as Friday
night in anticipation of seeing snow after cold rain fell in Taitung the
previous day.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is currently under the influence of a cold air mass from China. The
Central Weather Bureau issued a low-temperature report Saturday, which predicted
that temperatures along the northeastern coast and areas north of Chiayi County
will drop to as low as 10 degrees Celsius Saturday night and early Sunday.</P>
      <P>Snow also fell on Mt. Jade (known locally as Yushan) -- the highest peak in
Northeast Asia -- earlier in the day. At 6 p.m. the snowfall was measured at 2
centimeters. It was the second time snow had fallen on the mountain this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Young people should learn to share by volunteering: president</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou encouraged the country's young generation Saturday to
develop a philosophy focused on "sharing" through volunteering, which he said
would not only influence themselves and those in need, but also help forge
global friendships for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the inaugural meeting of the Regional Peace Volunteer Group as the
group's honorary leader, Ma said that by serving as volunteers, people can help
the underprivileged while learning to adapt to challenges.</P>
      <P>Ma suggested that young people volunteer to share their time, wealth, health or
life, such as making donations of money, blood or even organs, all of which he
said will have an impact on their own lives and those of the beneficiaries.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Ma made particular mention of Taiwan's remote towns and villages
and encouraged young people to contribute to the deprived areas.</P>
      <P>He suggested offering computer training to children there, which he said would
not only narrow the digital gap between cities and towns but also change the
lives of the children.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ma said Taiwan ranked among the top public welfare countries in the
world. Over 10 percent of the population has donated blood, and the number of
the country's volunteers in 2006 ranked fourth in the world and surpassed
100,000 in 2007 alone, the president said.</P>
      <P>He also mentioned initiatives launched by World Vision Taiwan to adopt poor
children in the world, as well as global disaster relief efforts by the Buddhist
Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, saying that all these acts of good will
"naturally" spread Taiwan's image, reputation and power, and helped bridge
friendships between Taiwan and the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, he will urge the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to launch more
programs with a focus on humanitarian relief instead of " checkbook diplomacy, "
in which Taiwan has tried to lure China's diplomatic allies to switch diplomatic
recognition by providing large sums of money and aid.</P>
      <P>The Regional  Peace  Volunteer  Group  was formed  by the Cabinet-level National
Youth Commission as well as civic groups such as the Red Cross Society of
Republic of China and World Vision Taiwan, along with 750 youth volunteer
representatives attending the convention earlier in the day.</P>

      <P>Another Taiwanese movie star, Mei Fang, won the best supporting actress award,
for her moving performance in the grown-up film "Orzboyz."</P>
      <P>Suming Chiang, an Amis aboriginal musician, clinched the coveted Best New
Performer award, for his brilliant performance in the film "Hopscotch."</P>
      <P>Chiang said the award came as a big surprise to him. "I'm very lucky to be able
to win in this 'lovely race' with a beautiful Japanese lady and a 'national
treasure,'" an emotional Chiang said at the presentation ceremony.</P>
      <P>The lead singer of a pop band beat two performers in the top grossing "Cape
No.7" -- the film's leading actress Chie Tanaka of Japan and Johnny C.J. Lin,
known as "national treasure" Mao Po in the film.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, "Cape No.7" captured two music awards -- the Best Original Film Score
and the Best Original Song -- with its pleasing music and lyrical theme song
"South of the Border." Composers Fred Lu and Lo Chi-yi said they appreciate

    <HEADLINE>Local synchronized swimmers fight to popularize sport in Taiwan</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7 (CNA)
12/07/08  10:49:21</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lali Shavelashvili worked her way through the old Soviet Union sports system to
become an award-winning synchronized swimmer at the junior level, so when she
arrived in Taiwan about 10 years ago, she was eager to pass on her knowledge and
experience.</P>
      <P>What she did not know but quickly discovered is that building a sports program
in Taiwan is often a Herculean challenge, even for mainstream sports, which are
plagued by a lack of funding, coaching and facilities.</P>
      <P>In such an environment, a less recognized sport like synchronized swimming has
even less of a chance to thrive, as Shavelashvili found out when she looked into
booking an indoor pool suitable for the sport in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>To her surprise, she could not find any because none existed -- at least none
with the minimum 3-meter regulation depth.</P>
      <P>Eventually she and a group of parents, who wanted their children to take up the
sport to improve their health, made an arrangement with National Taiwan Normal
University (NTNU) in downtown Taipei to use its 2-meter deep indoor pool --
adequate to train teenagers but still not up to international standards.</P>
      <P>Shavelashvili is convinced synchronized swimming is a good fit for Asians
because success does not depend on having a specific body type, but her
difficulty in finding a training facility only highlights the problems the sport
has had in gaining recognition and traction locally.</P>
      <P>Government indifference, the lack of a sports culture in Taiwan and insufficient
funding along with limited facilities have all hindered the sport's growth.</P>
      <P>Shavelashvili, who has taught synchronized swimming in northern Taiwan since
marrying a Taiwanese man in 1999, is particularly vexed by a culture that forces
young trainees to abandon the sport in favor of pursuing academic goals.</P>
      <P>The reason for this, she explained to the Central News Agency, is that Taiwan's
education system has failed to open channels for talented synchronized swimmers
to develop a future in the field.</P>
      <P>"It is heartbreaking but there's nothing I can do," she sighs.</P>
      <P>A recent casualty  of the system is Yang Yi-ju,  one of Shavelashvili's
students.</P>
      <P>Yang is one of four teenage members of a local synchronized swimming team known
as the "Silver Tsunami, " which has earned widespread applause around Taiwan for
its dazzling performances since the foursome came together in 2004.</P>
      <P>The group trains with Shavelashvili every Saturday at NTNU, but Yang, a senior
at Keelung Girls High School, recently pulled out for six months to prepare for
the university entrance exams that will decide her future.</P>
      <P>While Yang may one day resume her training,  her mother, reflecting the
pragmatism of many Taiwanese parents in directing their children toward higher
education and away from sports, nixed the idea of her daughter aspiring to
represent her country in international competitions.</P>
      <P>"That would be impossible. My daughter is fond of swimming, and the sport is a
good habit to maintain, but it is too difficult to build a career around it,"
said Yang's mother Wang Shuei-li.</P>
      <P>"She would have to practice almost 24 hours a day and if she eventually won some
big competitions, what could she become in the future? Could she find a good job
with her skills? " Wang wondered.</P>
      <P>With fewer than 100 students participating in the sport in Taiwan at present,
Wang's concerns are not unfounded, as Chen Chuan-min, an official in charge of
grassroots training at the Cabinet-level Sports Affairs Council acknowledged.</P>
      <P>Chen said the reality is that the government must invest its limited budget in
sports in which Taiwan is competitive enough to win medals in significant
competitions such as the Asian Games and the Olympics, meaning money, and
potential coaching roles for athletes like Yang, will be hard to come by in
synchronized swimming.</P>
      <P>However, parents and youngsters involved in the sport unanimously laud it as a
recreational pastime because it combines swimming, dance, and gymnastics, and
builds advanced water skills, strength, endurance, flexibility and balance.</P>
      <P>Like Shavelashvili, Vincent Shih from Taichung is committed to popularizing the
sport in Taiwan, founding the Synchronized Swimming Association of Taiwan (SSAT)
in 2001, and he believes the sport's benefits should make it attractive to local
girls.</P>
      <P>"In Taiwan there are no sports fit for girls to play, except for synchronized
swimming, " because it demands flexibility and basic dancing skills. Injuries
are rare because participants are always supported by water, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Parents are now discovering the sport's virtues, enrolling their children in
synchronized swimming courses because they believe the sport will improve their
children's lung capacity while helping them overcome the fear of being in deep
water, Shih said.</P>
      <P>The association every Sunday runs organized synchronized swimming courses in
Taipei -- at the NTNU pool of course -- and in Taichung. Russian Julia
Startchenko serves as the chief coach and senior adviser to Taiwan's only
organization dedicated to promoting the sport here.</P>
      <P>Aside from the obvious fitness benefits, swimmers also develop a "different
lifestyle, " said the 32-year-old Startchenko, who like Shavelashvili, began
living in Taiwan after marrying a local.</P>
      <P>She believes synchronized swimmers develop self-determination, self-esteem and
self-expression. "They are confident in their lives and have the determination
to achieve a goal, " she said while directing her students from poolside.</P>
      <P>Driven by his enthusiasm, Shih has taken various initiatives to build a wider
following for the sport in Taiwan, including trying to pave the way for young
swimmers to continue the sport without concerns over the academic futures.</P>
      <P>"While we have opened doors for those who are talented in the sport to enter a
high school without the need to take the basic qualification examinations, we
are working to prevail on a higher educational institute to take the talented
athletes and allow them to continue their training," he added.</P>
      <P>The government may lack any ambition to promote the sport, but Shih is confident
Taiwan can break into the top three in synchronized swimming in Asia, behind
China and Japan, if funding can be secured.</P>
      <P>"We need at least NT$2 million a year to hire professional coaches, organize
national competitions and send students to compete overseas to gain
international experience. Right now, all we have is an annual subsidy of
NT$240,000," Shih said.</P>
      <P>Wang Tzi-wen, in charge of civil sports organization affairs at the Sports
Bureau under the Ministry of Education said the ministry could finance plans to
send students to competitions abroad, if the activity's organizer submits a
"complete proposal."</P>
      <P>Any subsidy, however, would only range between NT$50,000 and NT$100,000 per
project. "It might not help a lot," Wang acknowledges.</P>
      <P>Parents have expressed their frustrations in appealing to the government for
funding, but Shavelashvili believes that government help is still necessary to
establish proper facilities and offer relevant training courses in school if the
sport is to thrive.</P>
      <P>While many barriers continue to exist that argue against a bright future for
synchronized swimming in Taiwan, the sport's faithful are not about to give up.</P>
      <P>Wei Shih-ting, a 14-year-old junior high school student who is learning advanced
synchronized swimming skills from Startchenko and her sister Helen, has her
sites set on the biggest prize, regardless of what sports authorities may think.</P>
      <P>"I want to be the country's first athlete to compete in the Olympics in the
synchronized swimming event, " she said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT chairman departs for Japan to cement bilateral ties</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung and his KMT delegation departed
for Japan Sunday for a week-long visit aimed at cementing bilateral relations
with Tokyo.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time the KMT chairman has headed to Japan to promote party-
to-party exchanges since the KMT came to power in May.</P>
      <P>During the visit, Wu and his team are expected to meet with leaders of major
political parties in Japan and several senior politicians who have assumed
important government positions.</P>
      <P>Noting that President Ma Ying-jeou is attaching great importance to the trip, Wu
told the media prior to his departure that the president asked him to pass on
some messages to the Japanese side.</P>
      <P>One of them, Wu said, was that in view of the "special partnership" Taiwan and
Japan have maintained, the two sides should spare no effort to further bolster
bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Japan are very close to each other geographically, share many common
interests and have deep historical links, with bilateral trade amounting to
US$60 billion and more than 2.5 million visitors traveling between the countries
per year, Wu quoted Ma as saying the day before.</P>
      <P>Wu said that although Taiwan cannot relinquish its sovereignty claim over the
disputed Tiaoyutais, a group of islets in the East China Sea claimed by both
sides along with China, the president believes that Taiwan and Japan "can put
aside the dispute and move toward pursuing their common interests, like fishery
cooperation."</P>
      <P>Wu said Japan may suffer some losses as a transportation hub after direct air
and shipping links between Taiwan and China are developed, but that overall
Japan will continue to benefit from closer Taiwan-China exchanges.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, a great number of Taiwanese enterprises have purchased
machinery and production equipment from Japan and then exported their products
to China, allowing both Taiwan and Japan to prosper from the triangular
relationship.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan and Japan can work together to crack China's vast market," he said.</P>
      <P>One of the key members of Wu's delegation is former Taiwan representative in
Japan Hsu Shui-teh. Wu said Hsu will contribute a lot to the visit because he
has maintained close connections with Japanese politicians  and has clout in
bilateral  Taiwan-Japan relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Grown-up orphans return to celebrate founder's 100th birthday</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 7 (CNA)
12/07/08  17:44:58

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 800 former orphans have returned to their common home, the Liouguei
Christian Orphanage, over the past two days to celebrate the 100th birthday of
orphanage founder, Reverend Yang Hsu, known in Taiwan as "the father of
indigenous orphans."</P>
      <P>Among the well-wishers were public functionaries, including local-level
government  officials,  teachers and policemen and policewomen, all of whom were
raised at the church-orphanage founded by Yang in the mountains of Kaohsiung
County, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At a concert held in Kaohsiung County Saturday night, physically challenged foot
and mouth painter Yang En-dian, who was raised by Yang and his Atayal wife from
infancy after she was brought to the orphanage in a basket in March 1974, said
"my heart has always been at the orphanage, which is my home forever."</P>
      <P>Yang En-dian was born without arms and later abandoned by her parents. Believing
that the baby was "sent by the Lord, " Reverend Yang named the infant "Yang En-
dian, " meaning "grace and benevolence from God."</P>
      <P>Little did he knew that the child would develop a legendary friendship with
then-President Chiang Ching-kuo, who reportedly visited the orphanage six times
despite its remote location.</P>
      <P>Chiang developed a special attachment to the child and arranged for her to
receive surgery in Taipei to help straighten her spine and allow her to stand
unaided. He even arranged for her to learn Chinese brush painting and
calligraphy.</P>
      <P>The child became a celebrity after a picture of her and President Chiang was
used on a postage stamp. Yang En-dian did not let the late president down and
grew up to earn her own living by selling her paintings. A courageous artist,
she now leads a happy and ordinary life as a mother and a wife.</P>
      <P>Chiang saw to it that the church-orphanage be helped financially after learning
that Yang and her wife, along with 20-odd "little soldiers, " developed the land
in the backwater mountainous area in Liouguei in 1964 in order to accommodate an
ever-extending family.</P>
      <P>When Yang and his wife arrived, there was nothing there. "All I saw were
aboriginal people that looked like my wife," Yang recalled.</P>
      <P>The couple made their church a home for indigenous Liouguei children who had no
food and no money to pay for school.</P>
      <P>As Yang and his wife became renowned for their philanthropy, and their names
spread to the people of neighboring townships such as Marlin and Taoyuan, they
had to enlarge the church to cope with the additional orphans.</P>
      <P>No one disputes the claim that Yang has 1,000 children -- given the great number
of indigenous orphans and homeless youths that the Shandong, mainland China-born
Christian missionary and his wife have raised over the past 50 years.</P>
      <P>The reverend's family is so large that his orphanage complex technically forms a
small town in the Liouguei mountains, about a two-hour drive from Kaohsiung
City.</P>
      <P>Counting his achievements over the decades, Yang said receiving copies of
records of merit or good deeds that were bestowed on "his children" is one of
his most rewarding pleasures.</P>
      <P>Among these achievers is Peter Chung, who graduated as the top student from the
Marine Academy; Liu Ming-tsung, an army officer decorated by the Presidential
Office for his outstanding performance; and Chou Pei-hung,  who studied hard and
passed the entrance examination for the prestigious National Taiwan University.</P>
      <P>Also among the well-wishers was Rachel W.Y. Liang, a star from a popular CTC
singing contest known as a Taiwan version of the British Pop Idol. Liang, in her
early 20s, was sent to the church-orphanage with her younger sister after their
Rukai father and Atayal mother died one after another about 10 years ago.</P>
      <P>Both talented singers, Liang and her brother had been members of the orphanage's
choir. She received special vocal training given by a Christian father from the
United States and received financial aid from a U.S. church to help her complete
college education.</P>
      <P>At the age of 100, Father Yang said that with God's blessing, his duties are
sweet and will never end.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Global credit crisis tops list of crises concerning local people</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7 (CNA)
12/07/08  17:54:07
(By Andrew Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers, which triggered a global credit
crunch, has been named by people in Taiwan as the most serious crisis of the
past two years, a recent survey conducted by the John Tung Foundation (JTF) , a
public welfare group, has found.</P>
      <P>The survey, which attempted to determine how recent disasters were perceived by
local residents and affected their lives, found that 46.8 percent of respondents
identified "economic crisis" when asked what came to their mind when they heard
the word "disaster."</P>
      <P>Earthquakes, at 23.8 percent, and traffic accidents, at 11.2 percent, were the
other types of calamities most identified as disasters.</P>
      <P>As for the disasters over the past two years that made the biggest impression on
local individuals, the credit crunch triggered by the collapse of Lehman
Brothers was chosen by a majority (53.5 percent) of respondents.</P>
      <P>Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy on Sept. 15, 2008, creating further
instability in financial markets and eventually sending already depressed stock
markets plunging further. Taiwan's benchmark index has fallen 30 percent since
mid-September.</P>
      <P>The results of the survey, which was conducted by the foundation from Oct. 15 to
Nov. 14 and obtained 8,738 valid responses, were presented at the 6th Union
Congress of Psychotherapy and Mental Health in Taiwan being held Sunday.</P>
      <P>Trailing behind the global credit crunch as crises that made a major impression
on people were the discovery of melamine-tainted milk powder and non-dairy
creamers in Taiwan, chosen by 20.8 percent of respondents, and the magnitude-8.0
earthquake that struck China's Sichuan province in May, the choice of 16.3
percent of those surveyed.</P>
      <P>Yeh Ya-hsing, the head of the foundation's mental health section, said the
survey's results indicated that the fear of crisis stems primarily from concerns
over the loss of life and property damage.</P>
      <P>"People said they are concerned with the negative effects of crises on their
everyday lives, " Yeh said. "Some said that if they were directly affected by a
crisis, the psychological trauma would hurt them more than physical injuries."</P>
      <P>The poll also asked the participants if they thought that the government's
response to crises had been adequate, with 68.3 percent answering that they were
not satisfied with the government's crisis management abilities.</P>
      <P>"But 21.6 percent of the people surveyed said they still had high expectations
that the government would respond well when a crisis did occur," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>"This means that people still have hope in the government, and therefore, if it
can actually handle crises, it will win back the confidence of the people," she
said.</P>
      <P>Yeh also pointed out that the foundation, whose main objective is the promotion
of "health for all" in Taiwan, will compile the detailed results of the survey
and make recommendations to the government on how to fine-tune its response to
the global credit crisis and how to develop confidence building measures.

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday that he is confident that Taiwan will soon
recover from the global financial "tsunami," not because of his administrative
leadership, but because of his confidence in Taiwan's people.</P>
      <P>"The people's resilience and persistence can help us tide over the difficulties,
" Ma said in his address delivered Sunday at a ceremony held at Taipei Municipal
Jianguo High School to mark the prestigious school's 110th founding anniversary.</P>
      <P>Ma said his administration will create some 300,000 jobs in the following four
years, with the first 100,000 being created within the next six months to help
spark the slumping domestic economy, which has been inevitably affected by the
global financial meltdown.</P>
      <P>"We don't expect Taiwan to emerge unscathed from this current global financial
crisis but hope at least that Taiwan will tide over the difficulties without
sustaining major harm like it did the last Asian economic crisis," Ma said.</P>
      <P>He added that after fully guaranteeing deposits at all banks around the country
in a bid to stabilize the domestic financial market, the administration has put
forth a four-year, NT$500 billion (US$15.15 billion) economic stimulus plan to
pull Taiwan out of its economic rut.</P>
      <P>The plan features extra funding for new and old infrastructure development
projects and the distribution of shopping vouchers worth some NT$80 billion,
aimed at spurring consumption and reviving Taiwan's suffering retail sector.</P>
      <P>In related news, Ma said at a discussion with members of the business and
industrial community in the southern county of Pingtung earlier in the day that
his campaign "check" of allowing the Kaohsiung MRT system to be expanded
southward to Pingtung county has not "bounced."</P>
      <P>"The development plan will be implemented once a more detailed assessment is
completed," Ma promised.</P>

      <P>The Parks and Street Lights Office of the Taipei City government is holding an
exhibition of poinsettia at the Taipei Youth Park, drawing crowds eager to see
the traditional Christmas flower.</P>
      <P>As Christmas nears, we will have a chance to view the many different species and
designs of poinsettias here in Taipei, said local resident Judith Yeh, who
brought her two sons and husband to see the exhibition.</P>
      <P>The exhibition will run through Dec. 30 and is open from 8: 20 a.m. to 11:30
a.m. and from 1:30 p.m. to 4: 30 p.m.</P>
      <P>According to the Taipei Youth Park, in order to highlight the different colors
of the poinsettia leaves and their respective beauty, the exhibition displays
them in three separate sections.</P>
      <P>One section is devoted to displaying and describing the many different species
of poinsettia. Another focuses on garden landscapes featuring poinsettias and
the third section is comprised of Christmas accessories, such as decorations
made from the flower.</P>
      <P>Poinsettias are very popular at this time of the year, said Lee Jien-hsuen, a
father of three.I'm here to select a few to decorate my home.</P>
      <P>According to legend, poinsettias became associated with Christmas when a poor
Mexican girl presented weeds as a gift to the Christ child as Christmas Eve
services. As she lay the bouquet near the nativity scene, the weeds suddenly
burst into red blooms, leading those there to believe they had witnessed a
Christmas miracle.</P>
      <P>Now, the perennial flowering shrubs that are native to Mexico, they are widely
used as Christmas decorations.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan will meet Monday to finalize the NT$85.7 billion budget for
its program to issue shopping vouchers to Taiwan's citizens.</P>
      <P>A Cabinet official said the budget will then be submitted to the Legislative

set up and operated around the clock, the official said.</P>
      <P>Under the Executive Yuan's plan, NT$3,600 in vouchers will be handed out on Jan.
18, one week before the Chinese New Year, which is the traditional shopping
season in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The government hopes that the vouchers, which can be used at all retail outlets
around the country, will stimulate spending and boost Taiwan's slumping retail
sector.</P>
      <P>The official said the Cabinet is working on an arrangement with local shopping
malls under which voucher users can get a discount if they pay for their
purchases using a combination of vouchers and cash or credit card.</P>
      <P>The approach would create a multiplier effect that would extend the economic
impact of the program, the official said.</P>

      <P>A group of students paraded through the boulevard in front the Presidential
Office in Taipei Sunday, carrying a coffin draped in national flag to underline
their claims that human rights died in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The march caused traffic chaos but was otherwise peacefully.</P>
      <P>Police followed the protesters and asked them--- three times as required by
law--- to disperse because their protest has not been permitted but didn't
bother to interrupt the parade.</P>
      <P>The parade began from Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall where these students has
staged a sit-in since early November and meandered through the Legislative Yuan,
Executive Yuan, the Presidential Office before back to the Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall.</P>
      <P>A leader of the protesters said they will end their month-long sit-in protest
Sunday night.</P>
      <P>The sit-in was held to protest what they claimed the police's brutality toward
protesters when Chinese top negotiator with Taiwan Chen Yunlin visited the
island.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued on Sunday, the students, who called themselves wild
strawberries, asked the government to change the law to give people the full
freedom to demonstrate.</P>
      <P>They also asked the government to probe "the excessive use of force" by police

    <HEADLINE>Lovers in Hualien rush to get married before Year of Rat is out</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hualien County, Dec. 7 (CNA)
12/07/08  21:34:15
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The eastern Taiwan County of Hualien recorded a considerable increase in the
number of couples getting married in November, compared with the same month of
2007, according to statistics released Sunday by the Civil Affairs Department of
the county government.</P>
      <P>Officials at the department said they recorded 178 couples getting married in
Hualien County during November, a rise of 20 percent over November 2007, which
saw 149 couples joining in wedlock.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the increase was probably due to the fact that many
of the couples rushed to get married before the Year of the Rat -- based on the
Chinese lunar calendar -- runs out in late January 2009.</P>
      <P>They said that many of the couples who preferred to get married in 2008 probably
felt uneasy about the superstition that the next lunar year happens to have two
first spring days -- one on the 10th day of the first lunar month and the other
on the 21st day of the 12th month -- and therefore is not a good year for
weddings.</P>
      <P>It is believed by some people that women who get married in a lunar year with
two first spring days would become widowed soon.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the bridal shops and wedding dress stores in Hualien have reported
brisk business despite the ongoing economic recession. Some store owners said
they expect another wave of weddings taking place in the county before the Year
of the Rat runs out on Jan. 26, 2009.</P>

      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung is scheduled to leave
for the Philippines Monday to brief Taiwanese businessmen from Asia at a meeting
in Manila on the new development in the relationship between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>According to a news release issued by the SEF, Chiang has been invited by the
Asia Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce to give a keynote speech on cross-Taiwan
Strait relations at its board meeting being held in Manila.</P>
      <P>Chiang will explain the Kuomintang government's policy toward mainland China,
the historic significance of his recent talks with his Chinese counterpart --
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) President Chen
Yunlin -- and the results of their talks in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are semi-official organizations responsible for handling
cross-strait  engagements  in the absence of official relations.</P>
      <P>While in Manila, Chiang will also meet with leaders of the local Taiwanese
community and pay a courtesy call on the Manila mayor, according to the SEF.</P>
      <P>At the second round of their talks held in Taipei Nov. 3-7, Chiang and Chen
signed four agreements to allow direct flights, shipping links, postal services
and the establishment of a food safety mechanism between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Chen was the highest-ranking Chinese official to have set foot on Taiwan since
the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.</P>
      <P>The  four  agreements  are  expected  to become  effective automatically this
month although it appears there is hardly enough time for the legislature to go
through the screening process.</P>
      <P>According to the Act Governing Relations between the Peoples of the Taiwan Area
and the Mainland Area, an agreement signed between the SEF and the ARATS will
become effective automatically if the legislature has not acted to sanction it
within one month after it was sent to its Procedure Committee.</P>

      <P>Ma Ju-long, a veteran Taiwanese actor, was named Best Supporting Actor at the
45th Golden Horse Awards, considered the Oscars of Chinese-language films.</P>
      <P>Ma was honored for his outstanding  portrayal of a local politician in "Cape No.

    <HEADLINE>Local synchronized swimmers fight to popularize sport in Taiwan</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7 (CNA)
12/07/08  10:49:21</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lali Shavelashvili worked her way through the old Soviet Union sports system to
become an award-winning synchronized swimmer at the junior level, so when she
arrived in Taiwan about 10 years ago, she was eager to pass on her knowledge and
experience.</P>
      <P>What she did not know but quickly discovered is that building a sports program
in Taiwan is often a Herculean challenge, even for mainstream sports, which are
plagued by a lack of funding, coaching and facilities.</P>
      <P>In such an environment, a less recognized sport like synchronized swimming has
even less of a chance to thrive, as Shavelashvili found out when she looked into
booking an indoor pool suitable for the sport in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>To her surprise, she could not find any because none existed -- at least none
with the minimum 3-meter regulation depth.</P>
      <P>Eventually she and a group of parents, who wanted their children to take up the
sport to improve their health, made an arrangement with National Taiwan Normal
University (NTNU) in downtown Taipei to use its 2-meter deep indoor pool --
adequate to train teenagers but still not up to international standards.</P>
      <P>Shavelashvili is convinced synchronized swimming is a good fit for Asians
because success does not depend on having a specific body type, but her
difficulty in finding a training facility only highlights the problems the sport
has had in gaining recognition and traction locally.</P>
      <P>Government indifference, the lack of a sports culture in Taiwan and insufficient
funding along with limited facilities have all hindered the sport's growth.</P>
      <P>Shavelashvili, who has taught synchronized swimming in northern Taiwan since
marrying a Taiwanese man in 1999, is particularly vexed by a culture that forces
young trainees to abandon the sport in favor of pursuing academic goals.</P>
      <P>The reason for this, she explained to the Central News Agency, is that Taiwan's
education system has failed to open channels for talented synchronized swimmers
to develop a future in the field.</P>
      <P>"It is heartbreaking but there's nothing I can do," she sighs.</P>
      <P>A recent casualty  of the system is Yang Yi-ju,  one of Shavelashvili's
students.</P>
      <P>Yang is one of four teenage members of a local synchronized swimming team known
as the "Silver Tsunami, " which has earned widespread applause around Taiwan for
its dazzling performances since the foursome came together in 2004.</P>
      <P>The group trains with Shavelashvili every Saturday at NTNU, but Yang, a senior
at Keelung Girls High School, recently pulled out for six months to prepare for
the university entrance exams that will decide her future.</P>
      <P>While Yang may one day resume her training,  her mother, reflecting the
pragmatism of many Taiwanese parents in directing their children toward higher
education and away from sports, nixed the idea of her daughter aspiring to
represent her country in international competitions.</P>
      <P>"That would be impossible. My daughter is fond of swimming, and the sport is a
good habit to maintain, but it is too difficult to build a career around it,"
said Yang's mother Wang Shuei-li.</P>
      <P>"She would have to practice almost 24 hours a day and if she eventually won some
big competitions, what could she become in the future? Could she find a good job
with her skills? " Wang wondered.</P>
      <P>With fewer than 100 students participating in the sport in Taiwan at present,
Wang's concerns are not unfounded, as Chen Chuan-min, an official in charge of
grassroots training at the Cabinet-level Sports Affairs Council acknowledged.</P>
      <P>Chen said the reality is that the government must invest its limited budget in
sports in which Taiwan is competitive enough to win medals in significant
competitions such as the Asian Games and the Olympics, meaning money, and
potential coaching roles for athletes like Yang, will be hard to come by in
synchronized swimming.</P>
      <P>However, parents and youngsters involved in the sport unanimously laud it as a
recreational pastime because it combines swimming, dance, and gymnastics, and
builds advanced water skills, strength, endurance, flexibility and balance.</P>
      <P>Like Shavelashvili, Vincent Shih from Taichung is committed to popularizing the
sport in Taiwan, founding the Synchronized Swimming Association of Taiwan (SSAT)
in 2001, and he believes the sport's benefits should make it attractive to local
girls.</P>
      <P>"In Taiwan there are no sports fit for girls to play, except for synchronized
swimming, " because it demands flexibility and basic dancing skills. Injuries
are rare because participants are always supported by water, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Parents are now discovering the sport's virtues, enrolling their children in
synchronized swimming courses because they believe the sport will improve their
children's lung capacity while helping them overcome the fear of being in deep
water, Shih said.</P>
      <P>The association every Sunday runs organized synchronized swimming courses in
Taipei -- at the NTNU pool of course -- and in Taichung. Russian Julia
Startchenko serves as the chief coach and senior adviser to Taiwan's only
organization dedicated to promoting the sport here.</P>
      <P>Aside from the obvious fitness benefits, swimmers also develop a "different
lifestyle, " said the 32-year-old Startchenko, who like Shavelashvili, began
living in Taiwan after marrying a local.</P>
      <P>She believes synchronized swimmers develop self-determination, self-esteem and
self-expression. "They are confident in their lives and have the determination
to achieve a goal, " she said while directing her students from poolside.</P>
      <P>Driven by his enthusiasm, Shih has taken various initiatives to build a wider
following for the sport in Taiwan, including trying to pave the way for young
swimmers to continue the sport without concerns over the academic futures.</P>
      <P>"While we have opened doors for those who are talented in the sport to enter a
high school without the need to take the basic qualification examinations, we
are working to prevail on a higher educational institute to take the talented
athletes and allow them to continue their training," he added.</P>
      <P>The government may lack any ambition to promote the sport, but Shih is confident
Taiwan can break into the top three in synchronized swimming in Asia, behind
China and Japan, if funding can be secured.</P>
      <P>"We need at least NT$2 million a year to hire professional coaches, organize
national competitions and send students to compete overseas to gain
international experience. Right now, all we have is an annual subsidy of
NT$240,000," Shih said.</P>
      <P>Wang Tzi-wen, in charge of civil sports organization affairs at the Sports
Bureau under the Ministry of Education said the ministry could finance plans to
send students to competitions abroad, if the activity's organizer submits a
"complete proposal."</P>
      <P>Any subsidy, however, would only range between NT$50,000 and NT$100,000 per
project. "It might not help a lot," Wang acknowledges.</P>
      <P>Parents have expressed their frustrations in appealing to the government for
funding, but Shavelashvili believes that government help is still necessary to
establish proper facilities and offer relevant training courses in school if the
sport is to thrive.</P>
      <P>While many barriers continue to exist that argue against a bright future for
synchronized swimming in Taiwan, the sport's faithful are not about to give up.</P>
      <P>Wei Shih-ting, a 14-year-old junior high school student who is learning advanced
synchronized swimming skills from Startchenko and her sister Helen, has her
sites set on the biggest prize, regardless of what sports authorities may think.</P>
      <P>"I want to be the country's first athlete to compete in the Olympics in the
synchronized swimming event, " she said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT chairman departs for Japan to cement bilateral ties</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung and his KMT delegation departed
for Japan Sunday for a week-long visit aimed at cementing bilateral relations
with Tokyo.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time the KMT chairman has headed to Japan to promote party-
to-party exchanges since the KMT came to power in May.</P>
      <P>During the visit, Wu and his team are expected to meet with leaders of major
political parties in Japan and several senior politicians who have assumed
important government positions.</P>
      <P>Noting that President Ma Ying-jeou is attaching great importance to the trip, Wu
told the media prior to his departure that the president asked him to pass on
some messages to the Japanese side.</P>
      <P>One of them, Wu said, was that in view of the "special partnership" Taiwan and
Japan have maintained, the two sides should spare no effort to further bolster
bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Japan are very close to each other geographically, share many common
interests and have deep historical links, with bilateral trade amounting to
US$60 billion and more than 2.5 million visitors traveling between the countries
per year, Wu quoted Ma as saying the day before.</P>
      <P>Wu said that although Taiwan cannot relinquish its sovereignty claim over the
disputed Tiaoyutais, a group of islets in the East China Sea claimed by both
sides along with China, the president believes that Taiwan and Japan "can put
aside the dispute and move toward pursuing their common interests, like fishery
cooperation."</P>
      <P>Wu said Japan may suffer some losses as a transportation hub after direct air
and shipping links between Taiwan and China are developed, but that overall
Japan will continue to benefit from closer Taiwan-China exchanges.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, a great number of Taiwanese enterprises have purchased
machinery and production equipment from Japan and then exported their products
to China, allowing both Taiwan and Japan to prosper from the triangular
relationship.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan and Japan can work together to crack China's vast market," he said.</P>
      <P>One of the key members of Wu's delegation is former Taiwan representative in
Japan Hsu Shui-teh. Wu said Hsu will contribute a lot to the visit because he
has maintained close connections with Japanese politicians  and has clout in
bilateral  Taiwan-Japan relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Grown-up orphans return to celebrate founder's 100th birthday</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 7 (CNA)
12/07/08  17:44:58

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 800 former orphans have returned to their common home, the Liouguei
Christian Orphanage, over the past two days to celebrate the 100th birthday of
orphanage founder, Reverend Yang Hsu, known in Taiwan as "the father of
indigenous orphans."</P>
      <P>Among the well-wishers were public functionaries, including local-level
government  officials,  teachers and policemen and policewomen, all of whom were
raised at the church-orphanage founded by Yang in the mountains of Kaohsiung
County, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At a concert held in Kaohsiung County Saturday night, physically challenged foot
and mouth painter Yang En-dian, who was raised by Yang and his Atayal wife from
infancy after she was brought to the orphanage in a basket in March 1974, said
"my heart has always been at the orphanage, which is my home forever."</P>
      <P>Yang En-dian was born without arms and later abandoned by her parents. Believing
that the baby was "sent by the Lord, " Reverend Yang named the infant "Yang En-
dian, " meaning "grace and benevolence from God."</P>
      <P>Little did he knew that the child would develop a legendary friendship with
then-President Chiang Ching-kuo, who reportedly visited the orphanage six times
despite its remote location.</P>
      <P>Chiang developed a special attachment to the child and arranged for her to
receive surgery in Taipei to help straighten her spine and allow her to stand
unaided. He even arranged for her to learn Chinese brush painting and
calligraphy.</P>
      <P>The child became a celebrity after a picture of her and President Chiang was
used on a postage stamp. Yang En-dian did not let the late president down and
grew up to earn her own living by selling her paintings. A courageous artist,
she now leads a happy and ordinary life as a mother and a wife.</P>
      <P>Chiang saw to it that the church-orphanage be helped financially after learning
that Yang and her wife, along with 20-odd "little soldiers, " developed the land
in the backwater mountainous area in Liouguei in 1964 in order to accommodate an
ever-extending family.</P>
      <P>When Yang and his wife arrived, there was nothing there. "All I saw were
aboriginal people that looked like my wife," Yang recalled.</P>
      <P>The couple made their church a home for indigenous Liouguei children who had no
food and no money to pay for school.</P>
      <P>As Yang and his wife became renowned for their philanthropy, and their names
spread to the people of neighboring townships such as Marlin and Taoyuan, they
had to enlarge the church to cope with the additional orphans.</P>
      <P>No one disputes the claim that Yang has 1,000 children -- given the great number
of indigenous orphans and homeless youths that the Shandong, mainland China-born
Christian missionary and his wife have raised over the past 50 years.</P>
      <P>The reverend's family is so large that his orphanage complex technically forms a
small town in the Liouguei mountains, about a two-hour drive from Kaohsiung
City.</P>
      <P>Counting his achievements over the decades, Yang said receiving copies of
records of merit or good deeds that were bestowed on "his children" is one of
his most rewarding pleasures.</P>
      <P>Among these achievers is Peter Chung, who graduated as the top student from the
Marine Academy; Liu Ming-tsung, an army officer decorated by the Presidential
Office for his outstanding performance; and Chou Pei-hung,  who studied hard and
passed the entrance examination for the prestigious National Taiwan University.</P>
      <P>Also among the well-wishers was Rachel W.Y. Liang, a star from a popular CTC
singing contest known as a Taiwan version of the British Pop Idol. Liang, in her
early 20s, was sent to the church-orphanage with her younger sister after their
Rukai father and Atayal mother died one after another about 10 years ago.</P>
      <P>Both talented singers, Liang and her brother had been members of the orphanage's
choir. She received special vocal training given by a Christian father from the
United States and received financial aid from a U.S. church to help her complete
college education.</P>
      <P>At the age of 100, Father Yang said that with God's blessing, his duties are
sweet and will never end.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Global credit crisis tops list of crises concerning local people</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7 (CNA)
12/07/08  17:54:07

    <TEXT>
      <P>The collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers, which triggered a global credit
crunch, has been named by people in Taiwan as the most serious crisis of the
past two years, a recent survey conducted by the John Tung Foundation (JTF) , a
public welfare group, has found.</P>
      <P>The survey, which attempted to determine how recent disasters were perceived by
local residents and affected their lives, found that 46.8 percent of respondents
identified "economic crisis" when asked what came to their mind when they heard
the word "disaster."</P>
      <P>Earthquakes, at 23.8 percent, and traffic accidents, at 11.2 percent, were the
other types of calamities most identified as disasters.</P>
      <P>As for the disasters over the past two years that made the biggest impression on
local individuals, the credit crunch triggered by the collapse of Lehman
Brothers was chosen by a majority (53.5 percent) of respondents.</P>
      <P>Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy on Sept. 15, 2008, creating further
instability in financial markets and eventually sending already depressed stock
markets plunging further. Taiwan's benchmark index has fallen 30 percent since
mid-September.</P>
      <P>The results of the survey, which was conducted by the foundation from Oct. 15 to
Nov. 14 and obtained 8,738 valid responses, were presented at the 6th Union
Congress of Psychotherapy and Mental Health in Taiwan being held Sunday.</P>
      <P>Trailing behind the global credit crunch as crises that made a major impression
on people were the discovery of melamine-tainted milk powder and non-dairy
creamers in Taiwan, chosen by 20.8 percent of respondents, and the magnitude-8.0
earthquake that struck China's Sichuan province in May, the choice of 16.3
percent of those surveyed.</P>
      <P>Yeh Ya-hsing, the head of the foundation's mental health section, said the
survey's results indicated that the fear of crisis stems primarily from concerns
over the loss of life and property damage.</P>
      <P>"People said they are concerned with the negative effects of crises on their
everyday lives, " Yeh said. "Some said that if they were directly affected by a
crisis, the psychological trauma would hurt them more than physical injuries."</P>
      <P>The poll also asked the participants if they thought that the government's
response to crises had been adequate, with 68.3 percent answering that they were
not satisfied with the government's crisis management abilities.</P>
      <P>"But 21.6 percent of the people surveyed said they still had high expectations
that the government would respond well when a crisis did occur," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>"This means that people still have hope in the government, and therefore, if it
can actually handle crises, it will win back the confidence of the people," she
said.</P>
      <P>Yeh also pointed out that the foundation, whose main objective is the promotion
of "health for all" in Taiwan, will compile the detailed results of the survey
and make recommendations to the government on how to fine-tune its response to
the global credit crisis and how to develop confidence building measures.

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday that he is confident that Taiwan will soon
recover from the global financial "tsunami," not because of his administrative
leadership, but because of his confidence in Taiwan's people.</P>
      <P>"The people's resilience and persistence can help us tide over the difficulties,
" Ma said in his address delivered Sunday at a ceremony held at Taipei Municipal
Jianguo High School to mark the prestigious school's 110th founding anniversary.</P>
      <P>Ma said his administration will create some 300,000 jobs in the following four
years, with the first 100,000 being created within the next six months to help
spark the slumping domestic economy, which has been inevitably affected by the
global financial meltdown.</P>
      <P>"We don't expect Taiwan to emerge unscathed from this current global financial
crisis but hope at least that Taiwan will tide over the difficulties without
sustaining major harm like it did the last Asian economic crisis," Ma said.</P>
      <P>He added that after fully guaranteeing deposits at all banks around the country
in a bid to stabilize the domestic financial market, the administration has put
forth a four-year, NT$500 billion (US$15.15 billion) economic stimulus plan to
pull Taiwan out of its economic rut.</P>
      <P>The plan features extra funding for new and old infrastructure development
projects and the distribution of shopping vouchers worth some NT$80 billion,
aimed at spurring consumption and reviving Taiwan's suffering retail sector.</P>
      <P>In related news, Ma said at a discussion with members of the business and
industrial community in the southern county of Pingtung earlier in the day that
his campaign "check" of allowing the Kaohsiung MRT system to be expanded
southward to Pingtung county has not "bounced."</P>
      <P>"The development plan will be implemented once a more detailed assessment is
completed," Ma promised.</P>

      <P>The Parks and Street Lights Office of the Taipei City government is holding an
exhibition of poinsettia at the Taipei Youth Park, drawing crowds eager to see
the traditional Christmas flower.</P>
      <P>As Christmas nears, we will have a chance to view the many different species and
designs of poinsettias here in Taipei, said local resident Judith Yeh, who
brought her two sons and husband to see the exhibition.</P>
      <P>The exhibition will run through Dec. 30 and is open from 8: 20 a.m. to 11:30
a.m. and from 1:30 p.m. to 4: 30 p.m.</P>
      <P>According to the Taipei Youth Park, in order to highlight the different colors
of the poinsettia leaves and their respective beauty, the exhibition displays
them in three separate sections.</P>
      <P>One section is devoted to displaying and describing the many different species
of poinsettia. Another focuses on garden landscapes featuring poinsettias and
the third section is comprised of Christmas accessories, such as decorations
made from the flower.</P>
      <P>Poinsettias are very popular at this time of the year, said Lee Jien-hsuen, a
father of three.I'm here to select a few to decorate my home.</P>
      <P>According to legend, poinsettias became associated with Christmas when a poor
Mexican girl presented weeds as a gift to the Christ child as Christmas Eve
services. As she lay the bouquet near the nativity scene, the weeds suddenly
burst into red blooms, leading those there to believe they had witnessed a
Christmas miracle.</P>
      <P>Now, the perennial flowering shrubs that are native to Mexico, they are widely
used as Christmas decorations.</P>
      <P>Those interested in attending the exhibition can make their way to the Taipei
Youth Park, located in the city's Wanhua district, on the number 12, 630, 212,
223, 670, 204, 249, and 205 city buses.</P>

      <P>Lawmakers of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) have reached consensus that a national vaccine fund
should be established to ensure a sufficient supply of vaccines in Taiwan, a KMT
legislator said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chung Shao-ho, a KMT legislator from Kaohsiung County in southern Taiwan, told
reporters that the legislature's Health, Environment and Labor Committee is
expected to complete the screening of amendments to the Communicable Diseases
Control Act on Dec. 10.</P>
      <P>The amendments, when adopted on the floor, will pave the way for the Cabinet-
level Department of Health (DOH) to establish a national vaccine fund to
stabilize the supply of various vaccines in Taiwan, Chung said.</P>
      <P>Huang Sue-ying, a DPP legislator-at-large who introduced an amendment to provide
for the establishment of the fund, also proposed another amendment, which would
ask all members of the DOH's Advisory Committee  on Communicable  Disease
Control to disclose  their relationships with pharmaceutical companies to
prevent possible irregularities in the procurement of vaccines for the fund.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan will meet Monday to finalize the NT$85.7 billion budget for
its program to issue shopping vouchers to Taiwan's citizens.</P>
      <P>A Cabinet official said the budget will then be submitted to the Legislative
Yuan for approval, now that a bill to give the Executive Yuan a legal basis to
formulate a budget for the program passed the legislature Friday.</P>
      <P>Of the NT$85.7 billion earmarked for the program, NT$83 billion will go to
finance the consumption vouchers and the remainder will cover expenses for the
vouchers' printing, distribution and envelopes containing the vouchers,
according to the official.</P>
      <P>In order to answer the public's questions about the program, a hot line will be
set up and operated around the clock, the official said.</P>
      <P>Under the Executive Yuan's plan, NT$3,600 in vouchers will be handed out on Jan.
18, one week before the Chinese New Year, which is the traditional shopping
season in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The government hopes that the vouchers, which can be used at all retail outlets
around the country, will stimulate spending and boost Taiwan's slumping retail
sector.</P>
      <P>The official said the Cabinet is working on an arrangement with local shopping
malls under which voucher users can get a discount if they pay for their
purchases using a combination of vouchers and cash or credit card.</P>
      <P>The approach would create a multiplier effect that would extend the economic
impact of the program, the official said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Lovers in Hualien rush to get married before Year of Rat is out</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hualien County, Dec. 7 (CNA)
12/07/08  21:34:15
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The eastern Taiwan County of Hualien recorded a considerable increase in the
number of couples getting married in November, compared with the same month of
2007, according to statistics released Sunday by the Civil Affairs Department of
the county government.</P>
      <P>Officials at the department said they recorded 178 couples getting married in
Hualien County during November, a rise of 20 percent over November 2007, which
saw 149 couples joining in wedlock.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the increase was probably due to the fact that many
of the couples rushed to get married before the Year of the Rat -- based on the
Chinese lunar calendar -- runs out in late January 2009.</P>
      <P>They said that many of the couples who preferred to get married in 2008 probably
felt uneasy about the superstition that the next lunar year happens to have two
first spring days -- one on the 10th day of the first lunar month and the other
on the 21st day of the 12th month -- and therefore is not a good year for
weddings.</P>
      <P>It is believed by some people that women who get married in a lunar year with
two first spring days would become widowed soon.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the bridal shops and wedding dress stores in Hualien have reported
brisk business despite the ongoing economic recession. Some store owners said
they expect another wave of weddings taking place in the county before the Year
of the Rat runs out on Jan. 26, 2009.</P>

      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung is scheduled to leave
for the Philippines Monday to brief Taiwanese businessmen from Asia at a meeting
in Manila on the new development in the relationship between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>According to a news release issued by the SEF, Chiang has been invited by the
Asia Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce to give a keynote speech on cross-Taiwan
Strait relations at its board meeting being held in Manila.</P>
      <P>Chiang will explain the Kuomintang government's policy toward mainland China,
the historic significance of his recent talks with his Chinese counterpart --
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) President Chen
Yunlin -- and the results of their talks in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are semi-official organizations responsible for handling
cross-strait  engagements  in the absence of official relations.</P>
      <P>While in Manila, Chiang will also meet with leaders of the local Taiwanese
community and pay a courtesy call on the Manila mayor, according to the SEF.</P>
      <P>At the second round of their talks held in Taipei Nov. 3-7, Chiang and Chen
signed four agreements to allow direct flights, shipping links, postal services
and the establishment of a food safety mechanism between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Chen was the highest-ranking Chinese official to have set foot on Taiwan since
the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.</P>
      <P>The  four  agreements  are  expected  to become  effective automatically this
month although it appears there is hardly enough time for the legislature to go
through the screening process.</P>
      <P>According to the Act Governing Relations between the Peoples of the Taiwan Area
and the Mainland Area, an agreement signed between the SEF and the ARATS will
become effective automatically if the legislature has not acted to sanction it
within one month after it was sent to its Procedure Committee.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipower ready to build nuke waste dump in Taipei county</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 8 (CNA)
12/08/08  13:57:09
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) said Monday that it will soon submit a water and
soil conservation plan to the Taipei County Government for the construction of a
new, dry nuclear waste dump for its First Nuclear Power Plant.</P>
      <P>Once the Taipei County Government approves the water and soil conservation plan,
Taipower will be able to start building the interim repository near the First
Nuclear Power Plant for dry storage of its spent nuclear fuel rods, said Tu
Yueh-yuan, chief engineer and Taipower spokesman.</P>
      <P>The First Nuclear Power Plant, located in the county's coastal Shihmen township,
has been operational since 1978 and is expected to be decommissioned in 2018,
according to Tu.</P>
      <P>He added that if the construction of the nuclear waste dump is postponed,
Taiwan's electricity supply might be affected in the near future, as the
existing dump for wet storage of spent fuel rods will be full by March 2010.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  gave conditional approval in late
August to Taipower to build the new dry-storage interim repository for spent
fuel rods.</P>
      <P>An EPA environmental impact assessment panel gave the green light on condition
that Taipower promises not to make the repository a final disposal  site and
that the company  "try to purchase" residential properties near the proposed
dump site.</P>
      <P>In addition, the panel suggested that a supervisory commission organized by
residents be set up to monitor construction of the dump. The panel also
stipulated that spent nuclear fuel rods could be stored in the planned
repository for maximum of 40 years, after which Taipower would have to relocate
the waste to a permanent disposal site.</P>
      <P>As the current waste dump, located within the plant itself, can only store spent
fuel from nuclear reactors for up to 30 years, Taipower must present a
construction plan to the EPA for the new, 0.45-hectare spent fuel rod
repository.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has three nuclear power plants in operation, with a fourth under
construction.</P>
      <P>According to Huang Ching-tsun, director of the Radioactive Waste Management
Bureau under the Cabinet-level Atomic Energy Council, the planned First Nuclear
Power Plant waste repository will be equipped with 30 casks, each of which will
have a storage capacity of 54 spent fuel rods.</P>
      <P>Huang noted that by March 2010, when the First Nuclear Power Plant will be
closed for an 18-month routine overhaul, 120 spent fuel rods will be removed
from the plant's No. 1 reactor.</P>
      <P>A total of 97,672 barrels of low-radiation waste, including spent fuel rods,
produced by the three nuclear power plants before 1996 were stored in 23
trenches on Orchid Island, also known as Lanyu, off the southern coast of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The island stopped accepting additional nuclear waste in 1996 due to protests by
local residents, and all waste generated since then has been stored at the power
plants themselves.</P>
      <P>Until a permanent repository is built at a location yet to be determined, all
the spent fuel rods will remain in storage at the three plants, said Huang.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that the government's  social welfare budget
will be its second-largest expenditure next year, behind only those for
educational, scientific and cultural development.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of an international forum on the welfare of people with
disabilities, Ma said there are at present a total of 1.027 million people in
Taiwan who are physically or mentally challenged, constituting 4.45 percent of
the country's population.</P>
      <P>With the number  continuing  to rise,  Ma continued,  the administration has
decided to allocate a budget of NT$19.2 billion (US$581.82 million) next year to
provide care for this group of disadvantaged people.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, "the figure is still not enough to cover all the costs in
this area and we will try our best to improve it."</P>
      <P>Ma noted that a United Nations convention on the rights of people with
disabilities is expected to be launched in two years, showing that protection of
the welfare and rights of the physically and mentally challenged is now a global
issue.</P>
      <P>He added that although Taiwan is not a U.N. member, the Republic of China
Constitution stipulates that the country's citizens should observe U.N.
charters.</P>
      <P>The international forum, titled "Proud to Be Myself -- Citizen Rights of Persons
with Disabilities" is being sponsored by the non-profit Eden Social Welfare

    <HEADLINE>Cabinet plans to boost effectiveness of shopping vouchers: GIO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  8 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Government Information Office Minister Vanessa Yea-ping Shih said Monday that
the Executive Yuan wants to boost the effectiveness of the government-issued
consumption vouchers by running a creativity contest on how best to issue the
vouchers and by setting up a Web site that will provide consumers with
information on discounts and sales.</P>
      <P>Shih made the remarks shortly after the Cabinet finalized a proposal on the
special budget needed to finance the consumption voucher program.</P>
      <P>"We want to create more value for the consumption vouchers," said Shih, adding
as an example that "some have suggested that discounts could be given to
consumers who spend just one of their nine consumption vouchers at a time so
that they will be encouraged to make nine separate purchases, thereby boosting
consumption."</P>
      <P>The current plan is to issue the NT$3,600 (US$108) to which each citizen is
entitled in nine vouchers, and the government is hopeful that consumers will
make additional cash or credit card purchases whenever they use the consumption
vouchers.</P>
      <P>Shih said the Government Information Office (GIO) wants to gather good ideas
from the public on boosting the effectiveness of the program to help shop owners
increase their sales volume, adding that a panel of judges will evaluate the
ideas and select the best of them.</P>
      <P>The GIO will announce further details about the contest later in the week, Shih
went on, adding that prizes will be awarded to the winners. The GIO also hopes
to obtain the rights from all entrants to publish their ideas, whether they are
prize winners or not, so that individual shop owners can consider them. GIO
staff said the prizes might be as much as NT$100,000.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Minister of the Interior Liao Liou-yi pointed out that the current
plan for the consumption vouchers is to issue each recipient with nine vouchers
-- three with a face value of NT$200 and six with a face value of NT$500.</P>
      <P>"If anyone has any better ideas, they should suggest them to the Ministry of the
Interior, which will provide awards in return for the best ones, " Liao said
after an Executive Yuan press conference on the finalization of the special
budget proposal for financing the consumption vouchers.</P>
      <P>"I want to encourage good ideas, " said Liao, adding, however, that the
government does not want to offer any more than 10 vouchers per person in order
to keep production costs down.</P>
      <P>He also said that any combination of the face value for the vouchers must
include one for NT$200 and one for NT$500 in order to boost the likelihood of
shoppers spending additional cash along with the vouchers and thereby increasing
their total spending.</P>

      <P>The Taipei city government has recently created an online "safety map network"
for citizens to report places in their communities that they believe are not
safe areas in which to stay or walk through, the chairman of the non-profit
organization that helped develop the map said Monday.</P>
      <P>The map, available at http: //subweb.health.gov.tw/TaipeiSafety and devised with
the help of the Hualien City-based Memory Space Institution (MSI), allows
members of the public to monitor the safety of the communities in which they
live, said MSI Chairman Lee Ming-hsien.</P>
      <P>Each year, more than 700 students from elementary schools through universities
lose their lives in accidents,  including campus accidents, Lee said, citing
statistics compiled by the Ministry of Education.</P>
      <P>Lee reminded the public to stay alert to dangers such as traffic on campuses and
elsewhere in their communities and to note areas that are unsafe.</P>
      <P>He encouraged the public to photograph any such unsafe areas and upload the
images to the Safety Map Web site to allow other users to see them. The
information could also serve as reference for the city government during urban
construction improvements, he added.</P>
      <P>Seven city schools have already registered with the Web site, Lee went on,
expressing hope that other residents all over the capital city will participate
in the work to develop a safe living environment.</P>
      <P>The non-profit MSI was founded in 2004 in Hualien City, eastern Taiwan, to
promote the concept and the establishment of healthy cities, communities and

    <HEADLINE>Computex Taipei 2009 to generate over US$25 billion in sales: TAITRA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 8 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Next year's Computex Taipei 2009, which will be one of the world's leading
information  and communication technology (ICT) procurement platforms,  with
more than 40,000 overseas buyers, is expected to generate more than US$25
billion in sales, organizers said Monday at a press conference to announce the
trade show.</P>
      <P>"Computex Taipei never stops outperforming itself, " said Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA) Vice President Walter Yeh, adding that with the
success of the show in 2008, Computex Taipei 2009 will be held at the Taipei
World Trade Center (TWTC) Halls 1, 2 and 3, the newly built Nangang Exhibition
Hall and the Taipei International Convention Center, to show the world the
latest technologies and products.</P>
      <P>Yeh noted that the show, which will take place next June 2-6, will bring
together possibly the greatest IT selection on earth, covering such categories
as components and parts, data storage devices, software, computer systems,
motherboards and add-on cards, communication  products,  peripherals,  displays
and  digital entertainment products.</P>
      <P>Organized by TAITRA and the Taipei Computer Association (TCA) , Computex Taipei
is the second-largest computer trade show in the world after Germany's CeBIT,
said Yeh, who added that "it is the procurement platform for hundreds of
thousands of professional ICT buyers because it is where visions are realized
and technologies are truly applied."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Computex Taipei does not show just product prototypes, but
the actual products themselves.</P>
      <P>In addition to the computer equipment, a further 1,800 vendors occupying around
4,800 booths -- compared to last year's 1,700 vendors and 4,481 booths -- will
display products such as car electronic devices, IC applications, embedded
products, medical electronics, auto ID, IP telecom, robots, digital signage and
security.</P>
      <P>"The great variety of products and technologies that will be on display
underscores Computex Taipei's status as the world's most significant ICT
procurement platform", Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Computex Taipei 2009 will not only exhibit the best and the latest in ICT
products, but will also stage a series of events ranging from forums to factory
visits, from conferences to a buyer's night, hoping to help visitors better
understand how the show has come such a long way and its critical role in the
development of the ICT industry.</P>
      <P>The new technology of WiMAX -- Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access
-- will also be on display, said Yeh, adding that the technology has grown 314
percent over the past year and, with government backing, will connect more than
80 million users by 2013.</P>
      <P>WiMax is still in the early development period, said TCA Deputy Secretary-
General Chang Li, "so it has high growth potential, as deploying fiber for next-
generation networks is an inevitable trend."</P>
      <P>Chang said it is estimated that the overall communication equipment market will
still enjoy moderate growth in 2009, despite the gloomy economic outlook, with
an annual growth rate of 3 percent and a market scale of US$428.7 billion.</P>
      <P>Asked if China will participate in next year's show, Yeh said close to 200
booths will be opened at the China Pavilion, featuring 120 exhibitors from China
and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Describing Computex Taipei as the pilot of the ICT industry, Yeh said he is
confident the 2009 show will give an insight into worldwide market trends and
demands.</P>

      <P>There are still some procedural details that need to be negotiated before Taiwan
can import a pair of giant pandas offered by China as gift, the head of the
intermediary Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Although the two pandas are expected to be delivered to Taiwan before Christmas,
some procedural details still need to be smoothed out, SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-
kung said.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the relevant details are being handled by Kao Koong-lian, vice
chairman and secretary-general of the quasi-official SEF, who has met with
officials from China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS) several times to settle some procedural matters surrounding the panda
delivery.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chiang said, the technical details -- including the exact time of the
pandas' arrival and which airline will transport them -- are being handled by
Taipei Zoo, where the two pandas will be housed.</P>
      <P>Chiang made the remarks at the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport before
departure for the Philippines and Singapore for a five-day visit to brief
Taiwanese business leaders there on the new cross-Taiwan Strait developments
since President Ma Ying-jeou took office in May.</P>
      <P>Kao said last week that the necessary papers for the pandas' entry are being
prepared by the SEF and ARATS.</P>
      <P>China first promised to send the two pandas as a gift to Taiwan during a meeting

    <HEADLINE>MOFA to release results of probe on lawmakers' foreign citizenship</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Monday that the ministry will
soon inform the Legislative Yuan of the results of a probe into whether Taiwan's
lawmakers possess American citizenship.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the Legislative Yuan,  MOFA's Political Deputy Minister Andrew L. Y.
Hsia said that the ministry last Friday received the results of the
investigation conducted with the assistance of the American Institute in
Taiwan's Washington office, and will release the results to the legislature as
soon as it can.</P>
      <P>Hsia stressed, however, that as some appendixes to the report have not arrived
and that the Legislative Yuan had made a classified request, the ministry "will
have to deal with the issue with caution."</P>
      <P>The issue of foreign citizenship was heatedly debated in the runup to the
presidential election in March this year. The Democratic Progressive Party's
(DPP) candidate Frank Hsieh had accused the Kuomintang's (KMT) candidate Ma
Ying-jeou of holding a U.S. green card.</P>
      <P>Ma, who won the election, had said his U.S. permanent residency rights, acquired
when he was studying in the United States many years ago, had long expired.</P>
      <P>The issue later spread to whether lawmakers  held foreign residency rights or
foreign citizenship.</P>
      <P>It is against Taiwan's  laws for lawmakers  to hold dual nationalities.</P>
      <P>One legislator on Monday expressed worries that some lawmakers might have
wittingly abandoned their foreign citizenship prior to the investigation being
launched.</P>
      <P>Opposition DPP Legislator Tsai Huang-liang urged MOFA not only to look into
whether lawmakers currently possess dual nationalities, but also when those who
used to hold foreign citizenship gave it up.</P>
      <P>He said that if the foreign ministry only bases its investigation on the
findings since it launched the probe in June, it will not know for certain
whether incumbent lawmakers held dual nationalities before the probe began.</P>
      <P>In response, Hsia said he would not deny such a possibility, but stressed that
if his ministry is to conduct such a probe, the Legislative Yuan should submit
an official request.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, KMT Legislator Lee Ching-an gave rise to public attention on
the citizenship issue after a local magazine revealed that she allegedly
possesses a U.S. passport.</P>
      <P>According to relevant stipulations, any lawmaker, if found to possess another
foreign nationality, will be stripped of his or her duties at the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>Following the incident, the Legislative Yuan approved two motions in May called
by the opposition  DPP requiring  an in-depth investigation  into the country's
legislators'  and government officials' citizenship status. The legislature
later suggested that MOFA begin by checking to see who has American citizenship.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Monday during a Cabinet meeting that the Executive
Yuan has finalized the proposal for the special budget to issue shopping
vouchers to all citizens of the country.</P>
      <P>Liu chaired the Cabinet meeting that focused on finalizing the NT$85.7 billion
budget plan for the shopping voucher program, which is aimed at stimulating the
country's slumping retail sector and boosting the overall economy.</P>
      <P>"As the Legislative Yuan approved the bill for the voucher program last week, we
now have to send our finalized budget proposal to them for approval," Liu said.</P>
      <P>He added that the Ministry of Finance and the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) will be pushing to have the NT$85.7 billion
(US$2.6 billion) budget bill reviewed and passed by the legislature as soon as
possible.</P>
      <P>The legislature last Friday passed a bill that would authorize the government to
issue NT$3,600 (US$108) in consumption vouchers to each Taiwan citizen.</P>
      <P>"We want to make sure that the effects of the shopping voucher initiative are
fully realized, " said Liu. "Therefore, I am asking all Cabinet agencies,
especially the Council for Economic Planning and Development, the Ministry of
Finance and the Ministry of the Interior, to coordinate well to make sure this
policy works at its best."</P>
      <P>In explaining the breakdown of the voucher program budget, DGBAS Minister Shih
Su-mei said that printing costs will amount to NT$287 million, media advertising
will cost NT$28 million, distribution of the vouchers NT$801 million, cashing
operations NT$837 million and consultancy services NT$13 million.</P>
      <P>The bill specifies that the overhead costs of the program should not exceed 3
percent of the total budget, Shih said, noting that the currently the overheads
amount to NT$1.966 billion, or 2.29 percent of the total.</P>
      <P>To ensure  that the vouchers  can be distributed  by the government's target
date of Jan. 18, the Cabinet must submit the budget proposal to the Legislative
Yuan by noon Dec. 8 and obtain approval by Dec. 26.</P>
      <P>If the budget is passed as expected, the vouchers would be issued on Jan. 18,
the week before the Lunar New Year holiday, and after the holiday until March
31. They will be valid for use until Sept. 30, 2009, and retailers must redeem
them by Oct. 31, 2009.</P>
      <P>The government  estimates that the program will boost the country's 2009 gross
domestic product by 0.64 percent, if all the vouchers are used.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An anti-betel-nut program launched by Taipei City in late May has helped 91 out
of 153 betel nut addicts to kick the habit, marking a 60 percent success rate, a
local health official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The program included holding the first ever betel nut withdrawal classes in the
city's 12 districts in May. Each the 153 addicts who participated spent eight
hours taking the classes that lasted for about three months, the official told
reporters.</P>
      <P>A participant identified by his last name Lin, who ended his addiction to betel
nuts, said he chewed about 30-50 betel nuts a day before quitting.</P>
      <P>One of Lin's colleagues in Taipei City's cleaning squad in which Lin worked
temporarily early this year, "forced" him to take the classes, worrying that
Lin's betel-nut affected mouth will hinder his social life, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>Lin ran a betel nut kiosk for more than 10 years before his temporary job in the
squad. After kicking the habit, Lin said he started selling Taiwanese cold
noodles, gaining quite good income of about NT$7,000 (US$209)-NT$8,000 each day.</P>
      <P>Those who have successfully given up chewing betel nuts will be able to save
about NT$10,000 - money they would have used to buy the Taiwan-grown products,
according to Lee Ming-hsien, a professor at National Dong Hwa University, who
was commissioned by the Taipei city government to hold the classes.</P>
      <P>Betel nut chewing damages the mouth and causes oral cancer, which is the fourth
top killer for men in Taiwan, said Chen Li-kai, director-general of Taipei City
Hospital's Dentistry Department.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that most betel nut addicts are men between the ages of 30 and
50, with many being their family's main breadwinner.</P>
      <P>The Taipei City health official said those who smoke, drink and chew betel nuts
have 123 times the likelihood of developing oral cancer than those who do not
have these habits.</P>
      <P>To help prevent oral cancer, the government is providing free oral cancer
screenings to people age 18 or older at several branches of Taipei City Hospital
this month, the official added.</P>

      <P>Sung, who was in excellent health, never awoke from the fall, which occurred
last week, her daughter Chen Shao-chia told the CNA.</P>
      <P>Although doctors declared her brain dead shortly after she was rushed to a
nearby hospital, Sung's other organs had remained healthy, and she had a normal
heart beat and strong lungs.</P>
      <P>Sung's dance coach Shih Ta-chien played DVDs of her performances on the dance
floor in Sung's hospital room, in hopes that it would revive her, but Sung was
pronounced dead on Monday.</P>
      <P>Prior to her death, Sung, who had the figure of a teenage girl, danced like a
pro, even though she only came in contact with dancing at age 76 when she was
trying to find some physical exercises which were also fun.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, Sung had a good physique with muscles and bones that were
much younger than her age. More importantly, dancing was so natural to her.</P>
      <P>Sung and Shih, who was also her dance partner, had appeared and danced in many
of the major television variety shows in Taiwan and had been invited to appear
on other educational TV programs. She was cited by local TV hosts as a role
model for retirees seeking to stay healthy and spend their later years happily.
Sung told CNA in an interview in September that she had become healthier and
happier than she was seven years ago before she took up dancing.</P>
      <P>"You expect more and more of yourself; it's something like an addictive feeling,
" she said.</P>
      <P>She and Shih had been invited to show off their dance moves in Southeast Asia
and Sung even danced in early September in Shanghai with Zhou JitianVone of the
top dance sport athletes in China. Zhou and his partner won the championship in
the tango competition in the 2005 East Asian Games and the title for New Stars
in the tango category in the World International Standard Dance Championship
held in Germany in 2006.</P>
      <P>Before her death, Sung's greatest dream was to take part in international
standard dance competitions abroad -- including, if possible, in Blackpool,
England, the mecca of professional ballroom dancers from around the world.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Season for Pacific saury coming</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The season for Pacific saury is coming as fishing boats have been seen sailing
into Taiwan's largest Kaoshiung Harbor over the past few days, unloading tons of
blade-shaped silver fish, named "Qiu Dao Yu" in Chinese or "sanma" in Japanese.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City Marine Bureau Director Sun Chih-peng said Monday the fish is one
of three ocean treasures the port city generates, along with tuna fish and
squid.</P>
      <P>"Now is the best time to have delicious cuisine with the fish, " he said.</P>
      <P>Every autumn and winter, Kaohsiung, one of Taiwan's ocean fishery centers, is
packed with pelagic fishing boats that have just returned from the North Pacific
fishing grounds, carrying with them loads of fresh Pacific saury.</P>
      <P>Sun pointed out that Kaohsiung's saury output has been one of the largest in the
world. Over the past five years, the annual output reached 50,000-110,000 tons,
creating an annual production value at between NT$1.2 billion and NT$2.5 billion
(US$74.48 million).</P>
      <P>Saury has not only offered Taiwanese residents a cheap and delicious source of
fish cuisine, but also brought substantial income to the port city, the official
said.</P>
      <P>The migratory fish are found in the North Pacific in schools, from Japan
eastward to the Gulf of Alaska and southward  to subtropical Mexico. They are
known to glide above the surface of the water when moving away from predators (a
behavior that links them to the flying fish, a cousin of the saury family).</P>
      <P>The ocean fishing boats from Kaohsiung usually sail to the North Pacific fishing
areas for the saury from the Southwest Atlantic Ocean, after completing their
hunting for squid.</P>
      <P>A local grill shop owner, surnamed Lin, said the best way to cook the saury is
grilling them in whole, coated with salt and then serving them with lemon and
turnip paste.</P>

      <P>A Chinese shipping delegation praised Taiwan's four international harbors
Monday, with one of its members expressing particular interest in investing in
Kaohsiung Harbor in the south of the country.</P>
      <P>The 18-member delegation, headed by Hu Hanxiang, director of China's Cross-
Strait Transport Exchange Association, arrived in Taiwan last Tuesday for an
eight-day trip and has visited Kaohsiung, Taichung, Keelung and Hualien harbors,
as well as meeting with representatives of Taiwanese shipping companies during
its stay.</P>
      <P>"Each of the four international harbors has its own distinctive features, " Hu
noted, adding that although the ranking of Kaohsiung Harbor in terms of the
number of containers handled has slipped in recent years, it is nevertheless a
good natural harbor with a tidal range of just 0.75 meters.</P>
      <P>He said the harbor has "great potential" and that one member of his delegation
has expressed keen interest in investing in it.</P>
      <P>The harbor, which enjoys a superb geographical location and operating advantage,
used to rank third in the world in terms of container-handling prior to 2000.
Its rank started to slip in 2001, dropping to eighth place by 2007.</P>
      <P>Hu also praised Taichung Harbor, saying that although it is an artificial
harbor, it has a vast hinterland covering a land area 1.9 times that of
Kaohsiung Harbor and seven times that of Keelung harbor, which he said is
favorable to its development as a container harbor.</P>
      <P>As for Keelung Harbor and its much smaller hinterland, Hu said it still has the
potential to be developed into a harbor suitable for bulk cargo vessels and
cruise liners.</P>
      <P>He also likened the nearby Suao and Taipei harbors as "the two wings" of Keelung
Harbor.</P>
      <P>Turning to eastern Taiwan's Hualian Harbor, Hu said it could specialize in
cross-strait bulk cargo such as gravel for the country's construction sector. By

      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu denied Monday that he will move to Taipei County in
northern Taiwan to run for magistrate of that county after his second mayoral
term in Taichung expires in December 2009.</P>
      <P>Clarifying a newspaper report that he may accept an arrangement by the
Kuomintang government to run for Taipei County magistrate, Hu told Taichung City
Council Speaker Chang Hung-nien that the report "is absolutely untrue."</P>
      <P>Taipei County is scheduled to be upgraded to the status of a special
municipality under the direct control of the Cabinet in December 2010, when
Taichung City and Taichung County will be merged into one administrative area
and given the same status.</P>
      <P>As a result, according to the Ministry of the Interior, the original December
2009 elections in Taichung and Taipei County will be postponed to December 2010
to coincide with the mayoral elections in the other two special municipalities
-- Taipei and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Later at a question-and-answer session with members of the Taichung City
Council, Hu reaffirmed that he will not run for magistrate of Taipei County.</P>
      <P>"I assure you I will stay in Taichung to finish my remaining term of office," he
said.</P>
      <P>"If I ever run for public office again, it's going to be in Taichung," Hu added.</P>
      <P>Ho Ming-chen, a city councilor of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party,
said it would be an "insult" to ask Hu to run for Taipei County magistrate,
because he is "premier material."</P>
      <P>"We hope the next post for Mr. Hu will be beneficial to Taichung, as well. If he
becomes Taipei County magistrate, what's in it for us?" Ho asked.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Kaohsiung City seeking to increase MRT ridership</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Dec. 8 (CNA)
12/08/08  19:53:42

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government is gearing up to increase the number of riders
using the city's Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system to some 300,000 people per day,
the city's Transportation Bureau Director Wang Kuo-tsai said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the city government is seeking ways to push up passenger
loads on the system to a ridership of 300,000 passengers per day -- up from the
current daily level of a combined 210,000 passengers (120,000 on the MRT and
90,000 on accompanying shuttle buses.)</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung MRT began its operations in March this year with the Red Line and
phased in the Organe Line in August.</P>
      <P>However, a Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) executive said the company is
set to post an annual deficit of NT$1 billion (US$29.9 million) next year even
if it reaches a daily ridership target of 300,000 -- a level that will leave the
company unable to pay for the interest on its loans or to pay for the phasing
out of carriages once they age.</P>
      <P>The system needs to attract at least 400,000 passengers per day to break even,
he explained.</P>
      <P>Since the launch of its construction until the end of September this year, the
MRT has incurred a combined deficit of NT$2.4 billion, said Kaohsiung City Rapid
Transit Department Director Lee Cheng-pin.</P>
      <P>In a bid to attract more passengers to use the system and its shuttle bus
connection service, the city government has earmarked NT$140 million in its 2009
budget to enhance the bus network and upgrade its services, Lee said.</P>
      <P>As long as the KRTC is willing to allocate an additional NT$42 million, the bus
service can be upgraded to a frequency of every 10 minutes, an improvement from
the present 20 minute frequency, Lee went on, adding that such a move would
definitely boost passenger numbers.</P>
      <P>In addition, he continued, the city government is also planning to build a light
rail rapid transit system to create further improvement, with the central
government having already approved a budget for the project.</P>
      <P>Despite these incentives, however, the municipal authorities are concerned about
declining ridership, which dwindled in November by nearly 700,000 passenger
trips compared to the previous month's level amid falling gasoline and fuel
prices, Lee noted.</P>
      <P>Later that same day, Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu urged President Ma Ying-jeou and
the central government to pay equal heed to the development needs of Taiwan's
southern regions.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the Executive Yuan should not just sit idly by in view of the
Kaohsiung MRT's operating difficulties but should extend the system to
neighboring Pingtung County, which was the projection prior to the launch of
construction.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to seek to join APEC agreement: Cabinet official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is to seek opportunities to be a part of an expansion plan of the Trans-
Pacific  Strategic Economic Partnership (P4) Agreement launched by four Asia-
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum member economies, a Cabinet official
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Deng Chen-chung made the remarks at the
Legislative Yuan, adding that with this year's APEC forum that took place in
late November, the greatest significance for Taiwan "lies in the P4's expected
expansion, " bringing three more APEC countries into the agreement.</P>
      <P>P4 refers to a free trade agreement that took effect in 2006 among APEC members
of Singapore, Brunei, New Zealand and Chile with the aims of reducing customs
tariffs and eventually clearing trade barriers, which they believe will help
enhance regional economic integration under the APEC spirit.</P>
      <P>Deng said Taiwan has shown interest in joining the pact over the past few years,
but noted that the country's efforts have been restricted due to political
obstruction by China.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that P4 was originally an agreement among the four founding
members alone, but now with more countries welcome to be included, Taiwan will
strive once again for their consent to admit the country as a signatory.</P>
      <P>The United States, Australia and Peru -- this year' APEC host country -- have
recently expressed their willingness to join the agreement, with the U.S. slated
to begin the first round of negotiations with the four initiating countries next
year.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang  Legislator  Cheng Li-wun emphasized  the importance of
Taiwan's participation in the agreement, saying it would provide a "great
opportunity" to offset the marginalization the country will suffer in the
process of regional economic integration and cooperation among members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which Taiwan is also prevented from
joining due to China's obstruction.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Natural gas prices to fall by another 12.99%</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) decided Monday to further reduce natural
gas prices by an average of 12.99 percent, after adjusting prices downward last
week for the first time since rates were raised in May.</P>
      <P>The latest adjustment was made retroactive to Dec. 1 and will be followed by
Great Taipei Gas Corp. and Hsin Kao Gas Co., the leading natural gas suppliers
to households in northern and southern Taiwan respectively.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the cut, household users can save up to NT$100 a month based on a
monthly consumption of 40 cubic meters, according to the MOEA.</P>
      <P>State-run petroleum refiner CPC Corp., Taiwan, which wholesales the natural gas,
said the price reductions will hurt its bottom line, with losses expected to
reach NT$35.32 billion this year.</P>
      <P>Monday's decision was made during the meeting of the MOEA power and natural gas
price consultant committee.</P>
      <P>MOEA Vice Minister Shih Yen-Shiang said the committee decided to lower the price
of natural gas for household users by 13.27 percent, translating to an NT$2.25
reduction per cubic meter in the north and NT$2.5 reduction per cubic meter in
the south.</P>
      <P>Households will now pay NT$16.34 and NT$14.69 per cubic meter of natural gas in
the south and north respectively.</P>
      <P>Industrial users of natural gas will get a 16.88 percent price cut, representing
a drop of between NT$3.07 and NT$3.41 per cubic meter, depending on different
calorific values, he added.</P>
      <P>Other customers, such as power plants running on natural gas, received slightly
lower price reductions, bringing the overall average rate decrease to 12.99
percent.</P>
      <P>Natural gas prices were first lowered by 2.99 percent last week, the first price
adjustment in the fuel since May 28, when CPC raised its average natural gas
price of NT$13.46 per cubic meter by NT$3.85 due to soaring international crude
oil and natural gas prices at the time.</P>
      <P>Last week's 2.99 percent price cuts were incorporated in Monday's overall
reductions.</P>
      <P>International energy prices have plummeted in recent months, but while  local
gasoline  prices  have been lowered  to reflect international markets, local
natural gas prices have held steady, triggering public pressure to bring them
down.</P>

      <P>Visiting Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung paid a visit to Tokyo Governor
Shintaro Ishihara Monday at the Tokyo City Hall and relayed President Ma Ying-
jeou's call for better ties between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Wu told reporters after his meeting with Ishihara that Ma cherishes Taiwan-Japan
ties and looks forward to stepping up bilateral exchanges and mutual
understanding  by putting aside controversial issues.</P>
      <P>The main aim of Wu's visit is to help the ruling KMT strengthen Taiwan-Japan
ties and explain the recent state of relations with China to Japanese
politicians and Taiwanese expatriates.</P>
      <P>Wu said, however, that he stressed to Ishihara that improving the cross-Taiwan
Strait relationship will also be in Japan's interests and that Taiwan pays equal
importance to its relations with Japan.</P>
      <P>In response to Ishihara's suggestion that Taiwan and Japan closely cooperate in
combating the current financial crisis, Wu agreed that the two sides are closely
linked to each other and that Taiwan maintains very special ties with Japan, as
the number of two-way tourist arrivals exceeds 2.5 million visits per year, and
the volume of annual bilateral trade has totaled around US$70 billion.</P>
      <P>The KMT chairman also relayed the president's appreciation to Ishihara for his
long-term concern over Taiwan and thanked him for Japan's support for Taiwan's
attendance at the World Health Assembly (WHA) as an observer.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan stands a good chance of taking part in the 2009 World Health Assembly
annual conference in May," he said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan needs greater international space, in particular its participation at
the WHA, because it plays an indispensable role in the world's fight against
epidemics," he asserted.</P>
      <P>According to the KMT chief, he also expressed his support to Ishihara for
Tokyo's bid to host the 2016 Summer Olympics.</P>
      <P>Wu was accompanied by a 14-member delegation, composed of Taiwan's
representative  to Japan John C.  T.  Feng,  former representative to Japan Hsu
Shui-teh, KMT lawmakers and officials and Taipei City councilors during the
30-minute meeting.</P>
      <P>It was Wu's first visit to Japan in his capacity as head of Taiwan's ruling
party.</P>
      <P>On Monday evening, the KMT chief was hosted by the Tokyo-based Interchange
Association Chairman Atshshi Hatakenaka at a tea party before taking part in a
dinner held by Feng in his honor in which several Japanese parliamentarians were
among the guests.</P>
      <P>Wu will proceed to Yokohama Thursday and visit the city's mayor, Hiroshi Nakada,
and meet Taiwanese community representatives there before heading for Kobe and
Osaka for the same purpose.</P>
      <P>He is slated to fly back to Taiwan Saturday.</P>
      <P>Japan, a long-term close ally of Taiwan in the region despite the lack of formal
diplomatic ties between the two countries, has been wary of the warming
relations between Taiwan and China since Ma came to power in May.</P>

      <P>The flood of E-mail spam, or junk e-mails, that bombards Internet users daily
has become a nagging problem, according to a survey released by the Taiwan
Internet Association Monday.</P>
      <P>The survey found that Internet users receive on average of 29 junk e-mails per
day, with most of them related to pornography, violence, fraud, online shopping
and computer viruses.</P>
      <P>As they are resented by the majority of people, up to 70 percent of recipients
simply delete them without bothering to open them up, the survey found.</P>
      <P>Based on estimates that it costs NT$0.02 to send one e-mail, the deleted spam
alone translates into an annual waste of NT$2 billion per year, based on figures
provided by Taiwan's top 20 IAPs (Internet Access Providers) that the volume of
spam reached 117.2 billion messages in the past year.</P>
      <P>On the effect of junk e-mail, the public is most worried about their propensity
to spread computer viruses, with 80.5 percent saying that they are irksome, 78.1
percent considering them a waste of time, and 51.6 percent saying they are a
waste of computer and Internet resources.</P>
      <P>Around 50 percent worried that the spam could inadvertently cause them to delete
other important information, and 41.3 percent said they are worried about being
defrauded.</P>
      <P>The survey also showed that 74 percent of the public hope the government can
formulate legislation or take administrative measures to regulate the spam.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted between Nov. 14 and Dec. 5, received 12,497 effective
samples with a margin of error of 0.88 percentage points.</P>
      <P>The association estimated that 10.14 million people, or 44 percent of the total
population, in Taiwan will have frequent access to the Internet as of the end of
this year,</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 24.1 percent of those polled spend between one and
two hours on the Internet daily if working hours are excluded, while 65.9

      <P>The survey also found that 64.5 percent send less than five e-mails daily, while

      <P>China Steel Corp. (CSC), Taiwan's largest steelmaker, has decided not to make
any further investment in Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC), a company
executive said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chung Lo-min, spokesman and an executive vice president of the steelmaker, said
the high speed rail corporation has been operating at a loss and therefore is
unable to issue dividends to its shareholders, including China Steel.</P>
      <P>"It would be unfair to China Steel's shareholders if we continue to invest in
Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp.," Chung said.</P>
      <P>He also indicated that China Steel's Board of Directors had already decided to
report the company's NT$4.74 billion (US$141.17 million) investment in THSRC as
a one-time impairment loss in the third quarter of 2008.</P>
      <P>Chung said that although China Steel had asked the high speed rail company to
redeem the preferred shares held by China Steel, THSRC replied that its current
financial condition would not permit it to do.</P>
      <P>"As a result, we could only decide not to invest any more funds in Taiwan's high
speed rail," he said.</P>
      <P>China Steel, which is 23 percent owned by the state, posted profits totaling
NT$12.58 billion for the third quarter of 2008, down from its NT$15.19 billion
earnings in the second quarter.</P>
      <P>According to the latest financial information released by the company, its
revenues in November dropped to a 28-month low of NT$15.38 billion, down 37.5
percent from October and 15.67 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>China Steel's steel production in November also dropped 17.55 percent from
October to 648,880 metric tons, a decrease of 24.94 percent compared to the same
month a year earlier.</P>
      <P>China Steel has mapped out a plan to reduce its steel production in response to
decreasing world demand by either shutting down two of its four blast furnaces,

      <P>Chu, an academician since 1988, is also the president of Hong Kong University of
Science and Technology.</P>
      <P>Wu said he is very happy to be granted the award, as many winners of the award
were Nobel laureates.</P>
      <P>He said research in superconductors will be beneficial for energy saving, as
superconductors can be used to store energy and avoid energy waste. It is also
an important material in nuclear fusion reactions for generating energy, Wu
added.</P>
      <P>The prize was established by the Sicilian Parliament in 1990 to recognize
scientists whose research helped improve the development of peace for human
beings.</P>
      <P>The award is named after Italian physicist Ettore Majorana, known for his
achievements in neutrino masses. He was born in 1906 and disappeared
mysteriously in 1938.</P>
      <P>Recipients of the award are elected every year by members of the World
Federation of Scientists, which, founded in Switzerland in 1973, has over 10,000
scientist members from over 110 countries.</P>
      <P>The federation is known for establishing the "Erice Statement" in 1982, which
opposes the use of science for militaristic means and promotes its use for
peaceful purposes.</P>
      <P>The two winners have received letters of congratulations from the Pontifical
Academy of Science Chancellor Marcello Sanchez Sorondo and World Federation of
Scientists President Antonino Zichichi.</P>
      <P>The award ceremony will be held by the Pontifical Academy of Science in the
Vatican in Rome Dec. 17.</P>

      <P>Minister  of  Transportation  and Communications Mao Chi-kuo said Monday that he
will ask Chunghwa Telecom to address the e-mail spam problem.</P>
      <P>Mao, who formerly served as chairman of Chunghwa Telecom, said he himself was
troubled by spam, or e-mail junk mails, when using the company's Hinet e-mail
box and, as a result, switched to Web mail services provided by other portals.</P>
      <P>"There is no reason why Chunghwa cannot improve the spam problem," Mao said.</P>
      <P>He said that Chunghwa can no longer use privacy rights as a pretext for not
dealing with the problem.</P>
      <P>The MOTC, as the telecom's largest shareholder, will ask Chunghwa to shoulder
the responsibility for improving the problem, he said.</P>
      <P>Mao believed that Chunghwa should give its e-mail recipients the option to
choose whether they want to receive junk e-mails.</P>
      <P>Mao's remarks came as a survey showed that the daily bombardment of spam has
become a nagging problem for Internet users in Taiwan, especially because they
generally feature content of a pornographic or violent nature.</P>
      <P>Media reports said that a Hinet mail box user surnamed Chen, in order not to let
his young daughter be exposed to the porno-related spam, has since mid-November
taken up a David vs. Goliath battle by returning all the porno-related spam
messages.</P>
      <P>His fight drew the attention of the MOTC, media watchdog the National
Communications Commission and Chunghwa Telecom.</P>

      <P>Paul Rosenzweig, a deputy assistant secretary for policy development of the U.S.

      <P>The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) , which serves as the de facto U.S.
embassy in Taipei in the absence of formal diplomatic ties between the two

      <P>Rosenzweig will also discuss Taiwan-U.S. cooperation on travel and

his stay, Rosenzweig will get first-hand information on the progress in Taiwan's
preparation for the issuance of e-passports.</P>
      <P>Noting that pushing for Taiwan's inclusion into the U.S. Visa Waiver Program

States in recent years, the official said the U.S. government has expressed hope
that Taiwan can first issue forgery-proof chip-embedded passports to reduce the
entry rejection rate for Taiwanese passport holders.</P>
      <P>The United States has offered visa-free entry for citizens from 34 countries,
including South Korea. The official said the MOFA and the Executive Yuan's
homeland security office have discussed the issue with the U.S. Department of
State and the Department of Homeland Security over the past few years.</P>
      <P>In addition to the issuance of e-passports, the U.S. government also wants to
reinforce bilateral anti-terrorist security cooperation before its inclusion of

      <P>Taiwan's steel exports fell considerably in November, with its largest steel
maker China Steel Corp. failing to meet the company's expected target by at
least 30 percent, informed sources in the steel industry said Monday.</P>
      <P>The sources, who declined to be named, cited figures showing that China Steel
sold 566,000 metric tons of steel in November, a decrease of 29.67 percent from
October.</P>
      <P>China Steel's quoted prices in the fourth quarter of this year were higher than
in the third quarter, bucking the international market where steel prices have
plunged in the final three months of the year.</P>
      <P>Despite the steelmaker's subsequent efforts to grant discounts to its customers,
its exports in November still dropped 30 percent from its target volume,
according to the sources.</P>
      <P>Some of the mid- and downstream steel factories in Taiwan were not doing well
either, they said.</P>
      <P>Yieh Phui Enterprise Co. -- a galvanized steel plant -- and Sheng Yu Steel Co.
both reduced output by 50 percent in November, compared with their peak outputs
in the first half of this year, after many orders from the United States and
Europe dried up.</P>
      <P>Among the smaller steel factories relatively less affected by the world market
downturn were Wei Chih Steel Industrial Co., Feng Hsin Iron &amp; Steel Co.,

      <P>Taiwan's exports declined in November for a third consecutive month,  indicating
that the lingering global financial crisis and economic recession have taken a
toll on the country's export trade, trade officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the latest customs statistics, Taiwan's outbound shipments fell
23.3 percent in November from the same month last year to US$16.78 billion, the
largest year-on-year drop for any single month since October 2001.</P>
      <P>Worse still, November exports to China and Hong Kong combined fell by a record
38.5 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Shipments to Taiwan's other major export destinations also plunged in November,
according to customs figures. Exports to the United States shrank 14.2 percent
and sales to the six major countries of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations fell 19.4 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>In the first eight months of the year, Taiwan's exports grew 16.8 percent

    <HEADLINE>Elderly woman who dazzled audiences as ballroom dancer dies at 83</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan legendary elderly lady who tangoed, waltzed and quick stepped on
professional dance floors up until her death, died of an accidental fall on
Monday. She was 83.</P>
      <P>According to her family, Sung Yu-heng -- who was invited to show off her
ballroom dancing skills as a special guest at the 2008 Professional Dance
Championships Asian Tour Taipei Open in February -- fell unconscious after she
tripped on the stairs at her home in Taipei County's Yonghe City while trying to
take her garbage out to a passing garbage truck.</P>
      <P>The garbage truck, like those in neighborhoods all over Taipei, picks up garbage
at designated times. Residents generally take their garbage out to the truck
when they hear the truck's melody.</P>
      <P>Sung, who was in excellent health, never awoke from the fall, which occurred
last week, her daughter Chen Shao-chia told the CNA.</P>
      <P>Although doctors declared her brain dead shortly after she was rushed to a
nearby hospital, Sung's other organs had remained healthy, and she had a normal
heart beat and strong lungs.</P>
      <P>Sung's dance coach Shih Ta-chien played DVDs of her performances on the dance
floor in Sung's hospital room, in hopes that it would revive her, but Sung was
pronounced dead on Monday.</P>
      <P>Prior to her death, Sung, who had the figure of a teenage girl, danced like a
pro, even though she only came in contact with dancing at age 76 when she was
trying to find some physical exercises which were also fun.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, Sung had a good physique with muscles and bones that were
much younger than her age. More importantly, dancing was so natural to her.</P>
      <P>Sung and Shih, who was also her dance partner, had appeared and danced in many
of the major television variety shows in Taiwan and had been invited to appear
on other educational TV programs. She was cited by local TV hosts as a role
model for retirees seeking to stay healthy and spend their later years happily.
Sung told CNA in an interview in September that she had become healthier and
happier than she was seven years ago before she took up dancing.</P>
      <P>"You expect more and more of yourself; it's something like an addictive feeling,
" she said.</P>
      <P>She and Shih had been invited to show off their dance moves in Southeast Asia
and Sung even danced in early September in Shanghai with Zhou JitianVone of the
top dance sport athletes in China. Zhou and his partner won the championship in
the tango competition in the 2005 East Asian Games and the title for New Stars
in the tango category in the World International Standard Dance Championship
held in Germany in 2006.</P>
      <P>Before her death, Sung's greatest dream was to take part in international
standard dance competitions abroad -- including, if possible, in Blackpool,
England, the mecca of professional ballroom dancers from around the world.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Season for Pacific saury coming</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The season for Pacific saury is coming as fishing boats have been seen sailing
into Taiwan's largest Kaoshiung Harbor over the past few days, unloading tons of
blade-shaped silver fish, named "Qiu Dao Yu" in Chinese or "sanma" in Japanese.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City Marine Bureau Director Sun Chih-peng said Monday the fish is one
of three ocean treasures the port city generates, along with tuna fish and
squid.</P>
      <P>"Now is the best time to have delicious cuisine with the fish, " he said.</P>
      <P>Every autumn and winter, Kaohsiung, one of Taiwan's ocean fishery centers, is
packed with pelagic fishing boats that have just returned from the North Pacific
fishing grounds, carrying with them loads of fresh Pacific saury.</P>
      <P>Sun pointed out that Kaohsiung's saury output has been one of the largest in the
world. Over the past five years, the annual output reached 50,000-110,000 tons,
creating an annual production value at between NT$1.2 billion and NT$2.5 billion
(US$74.48 million).</P>
      <P>Saury has not only offered Taiwanese residents a cheap and delicious source of
fish cuisine, but also brought substantial income to the port city, the official
said.</P>
      <P>The migratory fish are found in the North Pacific in schools, from Japan
eastward to the Gulf of Alaska and southward  to subtropical Mexico. They are
known to glide above the surface of the water when moving away from predators (a
behavior that links them to the flying fish, a cousin of the saury family).</P>
      <P>The ocean fishing boats from Kaohsiung usually sail to the North Pacific fishing
areas for the saury from the Southwest Atlantic Ocean, after completing their
hunting for squid.</P>
      <P>A local grill shop owner, surnamed Lin, said the best way to cook the saury is
grilling them in whole, coated with salt and then serving them with lemon and
turnip paste.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Chinese shipping delegation praised Taiwan's four international harbors
Monday, with one of its members expressing particular interest in investing in
Kaohsiung Harbor in the south of the country.</P>
      <P>The 18-member delegation, headed by Hu Hanxiang, director of China's Cross-
Strait Transport Exchange Association, arrived in Taiwan last Tuesday for an
eight-day trip and has visited Kaohsiung, Taichung, Keelung and Hualien harbors,
as well as meeting with representatives of Taiwanese shipping companies during
its stay.</P>
      <P>"Each of the four international harbors has its own distinctive features, " Hu
noted, adding that although the ranking of Kaohsiung Harbor in terms of the
number of containers handled has slipped in recent years, it is nevertheless a
good natural harbor with a tidal range of just 0.75 meters.</P>
      <P>He said the harbor has "great potential" and that one member of his delegation
has expressed keen interest in investing in it.</P>
      <P>The harbor, which enjoys a superb geographical location and operating advantage,
used to rank third in the world in terms of container-handling prior to 2000.
Its rank started to slip in 2001, dropping to eighth place by 2007.</P>
      <P>Hu also praised Taichung Harbor, saying that although it is an artificial
harbor, it has a vast hinterland covering a land area 1.9 times that of
Kaohsiung Harbor and seven times that of Keelung harbor, which he said is
favorable to its development as a container harbor.</P>
      <P>As for Keelung Harbor and its much smaller hinterland, Hu said it still has the
potential to be developed into a harbor suitable for bulk cargo vessels and
cruise liners.</P>
      <P>He also likened the nearby Suao and Taipei harbors as "the two wings" of Keelung
Harbor.</P>
      <P>Turning to eastern Taiwan's Hualian Harbor, Hu said it could specialize in
cross-strait bulk cargo such as gravel for the country's construction sector. By

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu denied Monday that he will move to Taipei County in
northern Taiwan to run for magistrate of that county after his second mayoral
term in Taichung expires in December 2009.</P>
      <P>Clarifying a newspaper report that he may accept an arrangement by the
Kuomintang government to run for Taipei County magistrate, Hu told Taichung City
Council Speaker Chang Hung-nien that the report "is absolutely untrue."</P>
      <P>Taipei County is scheduled to be upgraded to the status of a special
municipality under the direct control of the Cabinet in December 2010, when
Taichung City and Taichung County will be merged into one administrative area
and given the same status.</P>
      <P>As a result, according to the Ministry of the Interior, the original December
2009 elections in Taichung and Taipei County will be postponed to December 2010
to coincide with the mayoral elections in the other two special municipalities
-- Taipei and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Later at a question-and-answer session with members of the Taichung City
Council, Hu reaffirmed that he will not run for magistrate of Taipei County.</P>
      <P>"I assure you I will stay in Taichung to finish my remaining term of office," he
said.</P>
      <P>"If I ever run for public office again, it's going to be in Taichung," Hu added.</P>
      <P>Ho Ming-chen, a city councilor of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party,
said it would be an "insult" to ask Hu to run for Taipei County magistrate,
because he is "premier material."</P>
      <P>"We hope the next post for Mr. Hu will be beneficial to Taichung, as well. If he
becomes Taipei County magistrate, what's in it for us?" Ho asked.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Kaohsiung City seeking to increase MRT ridership</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Dec. 8 (CNA)
12/08/08  19:53:42
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government is gearing up to increase the number of riders
using the city's Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system to some 300,000 people per day,
the city's Transportation Bureau Director Wang Kuo-tsai said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the city government is seeking ways to push up passenger
loads on the system to a ridership of 300,000 passengers per day -- up from the
current daily level of a combined 210,000 passengers (120,000 on the MRT and
90,000 on accompanying shuttle buses.)</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung MRT began its operations in March this year with the Red Line and
phased in the Organe Line in August.</P>
      <P>However, a Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) executive said the company is
set to post an annual deficit of NT$1 billion (US$29.9 million) next year even
if it reaches a daily ridership target of 300,000 -- a level that will leave the
company unable to pay for the interest on its loans or to pay for the phasing
out of carriages once they age.</P>
      <P>The system needs to attract at least 400,000 passengers per day to break even,
he explained.</P>
      <P>Since the launch of its construction until the end of September this year, the
MRT has incurred a combined deficit of NT$2.4 billion, said Kaohsiung City Rapid
Transit Department Director Lee Cheng-pin.</P>
      <P>In a bid to attract more passengers to use the system and its shuttle bus
connection service, the city government has earmarked NT$140 million in its 2009
budget to enhance the bus network and upgrade its services, Lee said.</P>
      <P>As long as the KRTC is willing to allocate an additional NT$42 million, the bus
service can be upgraded to a frequency of every 10 minutes, an improvement from
the present 20 minute frequency, Lee went on, adding that such a move would
definitely boost passenger numbers.</P>
      <P>In addition, he continued, the city government is also planning to build a light
rail rapid transit system to create further improvement, with the central
government having already approved a budget for the project.</P>
      <P>Despite these incentives, however, the municipal authorities are concerned about
declining ridership, which dwindled in November by nearly 700,000 passenger
trips compared to the previous month's level amid falling gasoline and fuel
prices, Lee noted.</P>
      <P>Later that same day, Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu urged President Ma Ying-jeou and
the central government to pay equal heed to the development needs of Taiwan's
southern regions.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the Executive Yuan should not just sit idly by in view of the
Kaohsiung MRT's operating difficulties but should extend the system to
neighboring Pingtung County, which was the projection prior to the launch of
construction.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is to seek opportunities to be a part of an expansion plan of the Trans-
Pacific  Strategic Economic Partnership (P4) Agreement launched by four Asia-
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum member economies, a Cabinet official
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Deng Chen-chung made the remarks at the
Legislative Yuan, adding that with this year's APEC forum that took place in
late November, the greatest significance for Taiwan "lies in the P4's expected
expansion, " bringing three more APEC countries into the agreement.</P>
      <P>P4 refers to a free trade agreement that took effect in 2006 among APEC members
of Singapore, Brunei, New Zealand and Chile with the aims of reducing customs
tariffs and eventually clearing trade barriers, which they believe will help
enhance regional economic integration under the APEC spirit.</P>
      <P>Deng said Taiwan has shown interest in joining the pact over the past few years,
but noted that the country's efforts have been restricted due to political
obstruction by China.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that P4 was originally an agreement among the four founding
members alone, but now with more countries welcome to be included, Taiwan will
strive once again for their consent to admit the country as a signatory.</P>
      <P>The United States, Australia and Peru -- this year' APEC host country -- have
recently expressed their willingness to join the agreement, with the U.S. slated
to begin the first round of negotiations with the four initiating countries next
year.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang  Legislator  Cheng Li-wun emphasized  the importance of
Taiwan's participation in the agreement, saying it would provide a "great
opportunity" to offset the marginalization the country will suffer in the
process of regional economic integration and cooperation among members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which Taiwan is also prevented from
joining due to China's obstruction.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) decided Monday to further reduce natural
gas prices by an average of 12.99 percent, after adjusting prices downward last
week for the first time since rates were raised in May.</P>
      <P>The latest adjustment was made retroactive to Dec. 1 and will be followed by
Great Taipei Gas Corp. and Hsin Kao Gas Co., the leading natural gas suppliers
to households in northern and southern Taiwan respectively.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the cut, household users can save up to NT$100 a month based on a
monthly consumption of 40 cubic meters, according to the MOEA.</P>
      <P>State-run petroleum refiner CPC Corp., Taiwan, which wholesales the natural gas,
said the price reductions will hurt its bottom line, with losses expected to
reach NT$35.32 billion this year.</P>
      <P>Monday's decision was made during the meeting of the MOEA power and natural gas
price consultant committee.</P>
      <P>MOEA Vice Minister Shih Yen-Shiang said the committee decided to lower the price
of natural gas for household users by 13.27 percent, translating to an NT$2.25
reduction per cubic meter in the north and NT$2.5 reduction per cubic meter in
the south.</P>
      <P>Households will now pay NT$16.34 and NT$14.69 per cubic meter of natural gas in
the south and north respectively.</P>
      <P>Industrial users of natural gas will get a 16.88 percent price cut, representing
a drop of between NT$3.07 and NT$3.41 per cubic meter, depending on different
calorific values, he added.</P>
      <P>Other customers, such as power plants running on natural gas, received slightly
lower price reductions, bringing the overall average rate decrease to 12.99

      <P>Natural gas prices were first lowered by 2.99 percent last week, the first price
adjustment in the fuel since May 28, when CPC raised its average natural gas
price of NT$13.46 per cubic meter by NT$3.85 due to soaring international crude
oil and natural gas prices at the time.</P>
      <P>Last week's 2.99 percent price cuts were incorporated in Monday's overall
reductions.</P>
      <P>International energy prices have plummeted in recent months, but while  local
gasoline  prices  have been lowered  to reflect international markets, local
natural gas prices have held steady, triggering public pressure to bring them

    <HEADLINE>KMT head relays president's call for better ties with Japan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung paid a visit to Tokyo Governor
Shintaro Ishihara Monday at the Tokyo City Hall and relayed President Ma Ying-
jeou's call for better ties between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Wu told reporters after his meeting with Ishihara that Ma cherishes Taiwan-Japan
ties and looks forward to stepping up bilateral exchanges and mutual
understanding  by putting aside controversial issues.</P>
      <P>The main aim of Wu's visit is to help the ruling KMT strengthen Taiwan-Japan
ties and explain the recent state of relations with China to Japanese
politicians and Taiwanese expatriates.</P>
      <P>Wu said, however, that he stressed to Ishihara that improving the cross-Taiwan
Strait relationship will also be in Japan's interests and that Taiwan pays equal
importance to its relations with Japan.</P>
      <P>In response to Ishihara's suggestion that Taiwan and Japan closely cooperate in
combating the current financial crisis, Wu agreed that the two sides are closely
linked to each other and that Taiwan maintains very special ties with Japan, as
the number of two-way tourist arrivals exceeds 2.5 million visits per year, and
the volume of annual bilateral trade has totaled around US$70 billion.</P>
      <P>The KMT chairman also relayed the president's appreciation to Ishihara for his
long-term concern over Taiwan and thanked him for Japan's support for Taiwan's
attendance at the World Health Assembly (WHA) as an observer.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan stands a good chance of taking part in the 2009 World Health Assembly
annual conference in May," he said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan needs greater international space, in particular its participation at
the WHA, because it plays an indispensable role in the world's fight against
epidemics," he asserted.</P>
      <P>According to the KMT chief, he also expressed his support to Ishihara for
Tokyo's bid to host the 2016 Summer Olympics.</P>
      <P>Wu was accompanied by a 14-member delegation, composed of Taiwan's
representative  to Japan John C.  T.  Feng,  former representative to Japan Hsu
Shui-teh, KMT lawmakers and officials and Taipei City councilors during the
30-minute meeting.</P>
      <P>It was Wu's first visit to Japan in his capacity as head of Taiwan's ruling
party.</P>
      <P>On Monday evening, the KMT chief was hosted by the Tokyo-based Interchange
Association Chairman Atshshi Hatakenaka at a tea party before taking part in a
dinner held by Feng in his honor in which several Japanese parliamentarians were
among the guests.</P>
      <P>Wu will proceed to Yokohama Thursday and visit the city's mayor, Hiroshi Nakada,
and meet Taiwanese community representatives there before heading for Kobe and
Osaka for the same purpose.</P>
      <P>He is slated to fly back to Taiwan Saturday.</P>
      <P>Japan, a long-term close ally of Taiwan in the region despite the lack of formal
diplomatic ties between the two countries, has been wary of the warming
relations between Taiwan and China since Ma came to power in May.</P>

      <P>The flood of E-mail spam, or junk e-mails, that bombards Internet users daily
has become a nagging problem, according to a survey released by the Taiwan
Internet Association Monday.</P>
      <P>The survey found that Internet users receive on average of 29 junk e-mails per
day, with most of them related to pornography, violence, fraud, online shopping
and computer viruses.</P>
      <P>As they are resented by the majority of people, up to 70 percent of recipients
simply delete them without bothering to open them up, the survey found.</P>
      <P>Based on estimates that it costs NT$0.02 to send one e-mail, the deleted spam
alone translates into an annual waste of NT$2 billion per year, based on figures
provided by Taiwan's top 20 IAPs (Internet Access Providers) that the volume of
spam reached 117.2 billion messages in the past year.</P>
      <P>On the effect of junk e-mail, the public is most worried about their propensity
to spread computer viruses, with 80.5 percent saying that they are irksome, 78.1
percent considering them a waste of time, and 51.6 percent saying they are a
waste of computer and Internet resources.</P>
      <P>Around 50 percent worried that the spam could inadvertently cause them to delete
other important information, and 41.3 percent said they are worried about being
defrauded.</P>
      <P>The survey also showed that 74 percent of the public hope the government can
formulate legislation or take administrative measures to regulate the spam.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted between Nov. 14 and Dec. 5, received 12,497 effective
samples with a margin of error of 0.88 percentage points.</P>
      <P>The association estimated that 10.14 million people, or 44 percent of the total
population, in Taiwan will have frequent access to the Internet as of the end of
this year,</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 24.1 percent of those polled spend between one and
two hours on the Internet daily if working hours are excluded, while 65.9
percent spend more than two hours.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 64.5 percent send less than five e-mails daily, while
only around 20 percent send more than 10 e-mails a day.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has not imported pork or related products from Ireland, the Department of
Health (DOH) reported Monday, following Ireland'swarnings not to consume its
pork because it contained contaminants.</P>
      <P>European supermarkets have been ordered to clear their shelves of Irish bacon,
ham and sausages after authorities announced Sunday that Irish pork products had
been tainted with dioxin, a potentially cancer-causing chemical..</P>
      <P>According to DOH spokesman Wang Je-chau, the DOH's Bureau of Food Safety has
checked customs clearance documents which showed that no Irish pork products
have been imported into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Foreign wire service reprots said European health officials have warned their
consumers not to eat Irish pork after the discovery that dioxins had been in
some of the pigs' feed for months.</P>
      <P>Irish government officials described the recall, which affects all pig products
produced since Sept. 1, as a precautionary move, but farmers called it a

    <TEXT>
      <P>China Steel Corp. (CSC), Taiwan's largest steelmaker, has decided not to make
any further investment in Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC), a company
executive said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chung Lo-min, spokesman and an executive vice president of the steelmaker, said
the high speed rail corporation has been operating at a loss and therefore is
unable to issue dividends to its shareholders, including China Steel.</P>
      <P>"It would be unfair to China Steel's shareholders if we continue to invest in
Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp.," Chung said.</P>
      <P>He also indicated that China Steel's Board of Directors had already decided to
report the company's NT$4.74 billion (US$141.17 million) investment in THSRC as
a one-time impairment loss in the third quarter of 2008.</P>
      <P>Chung said that although China Steel had asked the high speed rail company to
redeem the preferred shares held by China Steel, THSRC replied that its current
financial condition would not permit it to do.</P>
      <P>"As a result, we could only decide not to invest any more funds in Taiwan's high
speed rail," he said.</P>
      <P>China Steel, which is 23 percent owned by the state, posted profits totaling
NT$12.58 billion for the third quarter of 2008, down from its NT$15.19 billion
earnings in the second quarter.</P>
      <P>According to the latest financial information released by the company, its
revenues in November dropped to a 28-month low of NT$15.38 billion, down 37.5
percent from October and 15.67 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>China Steel's steel production in November also dropped 17.55 percent from
October to 648,880 metric tons, a decrease of 24.94 percent compared to the same
month a year earlier.</P>
      <P>China Steel has mapped out a plan to reduce its steel production in response to
decreasing world demand by either shutting down two of its four blast furnaces,
or by "damping" them down to keep production at a minimum.</P>

      <P>Two academicians of Taiwan's top research institute Academia Sinica won an
Italian science award for their scientific advancement for peaceful purposes,
according to a press statement released by Academia Sinica Monday.</P>
      <P>Wu Maw-kuen and Chu Ching-wu won the award together for their discovery of the Y
Ba2 Cu3 superconductor, which is the first superconductor system with a
transition temperature exceeding 77 degrees Kelvin, in addition to their
continuous contributions in physics education, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Wu, who was made an academician in 1998, directs Academia Sinica's Institute of
Physics and is a foreign associate of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences.</P>
      <P>Chu, an academician since 1988, is also the president of Hong Kong University of
Science and Technology.</P>
      <P>Wu said he is very happy to be granted the award, as many winners of the award
were Nobel laureates.</P>
      <P>He said research in superconductors will be beneficial for energy saving, as
superconductors can be used to store energy and avoid energy waste. It is also
an important material in nuclear fusion reactions for generating energy, Wu
added.</P>
      <P>The prize was established by the Sicilian Parliament in 1990 to recognize
scientists whose research helped improve the development of peace for human
beings.</P>
      <P>The award is named after Italian physicist Ettore Majorana, known for his
achievements in neutrino masses. He was born in 1906 and disappeared
mysteriously in 1938.</P>
      <P>Recipients of the award are elected every year by members of the World
Federation of Scientists, which, founded in Switzerland in 1973, has over 10,000
scientist members from over 110 countries.</P>
      <P>The federation is known for establishing the "Erice Statement" in 1982, which
opposes the use of science for militaristic means and promotes its use for
peaceful purposes.</P>
      <P>The two winners have received letters of congratulations from the Pontifical
Academy of Science Chancellor Marcello Sanchez Sorondo and World Federation of
Scientists President Antonino Zichichi.</P>
      <P>The award ceremony will be held by the Pontifical Academy of Science in the

      <P>Minister  of  Transportation  and Communications Mao Chi-kuo said Monday that he
will ask Chunghwa Telecom to address the e-mail spam problem.</P>
      <P>Mao, who formerly served as chairman of Chunghwa Telecom, said he himself was
troubled by spam, or e-mail junk mails, when using the company's Hinet e-mail
box and, as a result, switched to Web mail services provided by other portals.</P>
      <P>"There is no reason why Chunghwa cannot improve the spam problem," Mao said.</P>
      <P>He said that Chunghwa can no longer use privacy rights as a pretext for not
dealing with the problem.</P>
      <P>The MOTC, as the telecom's largest shareholder, will ask Chunghwa to shoulder
the responsibility for improving the problem, he said.</P>
      <P>Mao believed that Chunghwa should give its e-mail recipients the option to
choose whether they want to receive junk e-mails.</P>
      <P>Mao's remarks came as a survey showed that the daily bombardment of spam has
become a nagging problem for Internet users in Taiwan, especially because they
generally feature content of a pornographic or violent nature.</P>
      <P>Media reports said that a Hinet mail box user surnamed Chen, in order not to let
his young daughter be exposed to the porno-related spam, has since mid-November
taken up a David vs. Goliath battle by returning all the porno-related spam
messages.</P>

      <P>Paul Rosenzweig, a deputy assistant secretary for policy development of the U.S.

      <P>The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) , which serves as the de facto U.S.
embassy in Taipei in the absence of formal diplomatic ties between the two
countries, said in a statement that Rosenzweig will deliver a speech on critical
infrastructure  protection at an international conference on homeland security
and technology.</P>
      <P>Rosenzweig will also discuss Taiwan-U.S. cooperation on travel and
transportation  security with Taiwan authorities,  the AIT statement added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official told CNA that during
his stay, Rosenzweig will get first-hand information on the progress in Taiwan's
preparation for the issuance of e-passports.</P>
      <P>Noting that pushing for Taiwan's inclusion into the U.S. Visa Waiver Program
(VWP) is one of the MOFA's priority diplomatic goals in its work with the United
States in recent years, the official said the U.S. government has expressed hope
that Taiwan can first issue forgery-proof chip-embedded passports to reduce the
entry rejection rate for Taiwanese passport holders.</P>
      <P>The United States has offered visa-free entry for citizens from 34 countries,
including South Korea. The official said the MOFA and the Executive Yuan's
homeland security office have discussed the issue with the U.S. Department of
State and the Department of Homeland Security over the past few years.</P>
      <P>In addition to the issuance of e-passports, the U.S. government also wants to
reinforce bilateral anti-terrorist security cooperation before its inclusion of

      <P>Taiwan's steel exports fell considerably in November, with its largest steel
maker China Steel Corp. failing to meet the company's expected target by at
least 30 percent, informed sources in the steel industry said Monday.</P>
      <P>The sources, who declined to be named, cited figures showing that China Steel
sold 566,000 metric tons of steel in November, a decrease of 29.67 percent from
October.</P>
      <P>China Steel's quoted prices in the fourth quarter of this year were higher than
in the third quarter, bucking the international market where steel prices have
plunged in the final three months of the year.</P>
      <P>Despite the steelmaker's subsequent efforts to grant discounts to its customers,
its exports in November still dropped 30 percent from its target volume,
according to the sources.</P>
      <P>Some of the mid- and downstream steel factories in Taiwan were not doing well
either, they said.</P>
      <P>Yieh Phui Enterprise Co. -- a galvanized steel plant -- and Sheng Yu Steel Co.
both reduced output by 50 percent in November, compared with their peak outputs
in the first half of this year, after many orders from the United States and
Europe dried up.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's exports declined in November for a third consecutive month,  indicating

    <HEADLINE>Poorly capitalized banks to be weeded out</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 9 (CNA)

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed an amendment to the Banking Act Tuesday to provide a
mechanism for authorities to weed out poorly capitalized banks.</P>
      <P>The amendment divides banks into four categories based on their capital adequacy
ratios, the amount of capital a bank has relative to its risk weighted credit
exposures.</P>
      <P>The categories are those having adequate capital, those having inadequate
capital, those having significantly inadequate capital, and those having
seriously inadequate capital.</P>
      <P>Banks will be considered to have seriously inadequate capital when their capital
adequacy ratio stands at lower than 2 percent (compared to the standard 8
percent) , and will be taken over by the authorities if failing to improve the
problem within a specific period of time, the amendment stipulated.</P>
      <P>The amendment also empowered banks to disclose information of debtors who have
accumulated written-off bad debts of over NT$50 million or those who have seen
their written-off bad debts grow to NT$30 million or more within six months.</P>
      <P>Banks can also make public information on debtors who have been charged in a
case of public prosecution, according to the amendment.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the amendment lifed a ban prohibiting a single individual from
holding over 25 percent of a bank's issued stock.</P>
      <P>However, individuals holding over 5 percent of a bank's shares will be required
to make a declaration with the authorities, and those intending to hold over 10
percent, 25 percent or 50 percent of a bank's shares will be required to obtain
permission from the authorities in advance.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA delays report on lawmakers' foreign citizenship</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday it could not inform the
Legislative Yuan of the results of a probe into whether Taiwan's lawmakers hold
U.S. citizenship due to what it described asunclear wordingin Washington's
report on its investigation.</P>
      <P>Speaking after a meeting with Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, Foreign
Minister Francisco H. L. Ou said that the ministry will request further American
assistance in clarifying some key points that it found unclear in the report
conducted by the American Institute in Taiwan's Washington office.</P>
      <P>He said that as the MOFA was only commissioned by the legislature to facilitate
the probe by requesting help from a foreign government, the ministry is not in a
position to reveal those statements seen as being unclear or any other aspects
of the report.</P>
      <P>Ou expressed his hope that the United States will reply as soon as it can, but
added that the ministry will respect the standard operating procedures of the
American authorities as well as the length of time required to further
investigate the matter.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) questioned the MOFA's handling
of the citizenship issue, accusing the ministry of intentionally delaying the
release of the results.</P>
      <P>DPP caucus whip Lai Ching-te  voiced skepticism  over the ministry's stated
reason for not forwarding the results of the probe to the legislature, and he
also demanded that Ou should explain why he met with President Ma Ying-jeou a
day earlier.</P>
      <P>In response, Ou said he went to the Presidential Office to discuss diplomatic
and national security issues with the president, and did not touch on the issue
of legislatorsdual nationalities.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lai also urged Wang not only to look into whether lawmakers currently
possess dual nationalities, but also when those who once held foreign
citizenship gave it up, as he said some lawmakers might have consciously
abandoned their foreign citizenship prior to the investigation being launched.</P>
      <P>According to the law, any lawmaker,  if found to possess citizenship in a second
country, will be stripped of his or her duties at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The issue of dual citizenship among local politicians was heatedly debated in
the runup to the presidential election in March this year.</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate Frank Hsieh accused Kuomintang's
(KMT) candidate Ma Ying-jeou of holding a valid U.S. green card and portrayed
him as an American citizen in campaign banners.</P>
      <P>Ma, who won the election, said his U.S. permanent residency rights, obtained
when he was studying in the United States in the late 1970s, had long since
expired.</P>
      <P>The issue later spread to whether lawmakers  held foreign residency rights or
foreign citizenship, focusing specifically on KMT Legislator Lee Ching-an after
a local magazine alleged that she held a U.S. passport at the time.</P>
      <P>Following the incident, the Legislative Yuan approved two motions in May
submitted by the opposition DPP that required an in-depth investigation  into
the citizenship  status  of the country's legislators and government officials.</P>
      <P>The legislature later suggested that MOFA begin by checking to see who has
American citizenship.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan Beer to make inroads into China market in February</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Beer, the best selling beer in its home market, can finally launch its
brand in China after successfully registering its celebrated trademark there.</P>
      <P>Duan Wei, chairman of the state-run Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corp. (TTLC) ,
announced Tuesday that the local beer is expected to appear in China's market in
February.</P>
      <P>Wei described the success of having the trademark, Taiwan Beer, registered on
the other side of the Taiwan Strait as a "significant" triumph.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Beer has existed in Taiwan for more than five decades and holds an 85
percent share of the local beer market, Wei said, and felt the company's success
represented an important precedent.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan Beer had failed in registering in China, many other celebrated
Chinese trademarks would also face the same challenge in Taiwan," he stated.</P>
      <P>Wei attributed the "happy ending" in the trademark battle to the thawing of
long-frozen cross-Taiwan Strait ties since President Ma Ying-jeou of the
Kuomintang took power in May.</P>
      <P>In 1999, the government-run Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau -- that
changed its name to TTLC in 2002 -- began efforts to register the Taiwan Beer
trademark in China, but sustained countless failures due to the sensitive word
"Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Wei said after the breakthrough, "I will not reject any moves to further boost
cross-strait exchanges. For example, Chinese cigarettes can be shipped to Taiwan
from their Shanghai production lines.</P>
      <P>"The TTLC's cigarette factories are also willing to serve as their contract
manufacturer in Taiwan," Wei said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tseng pitches for LPGA event to be held in Taiwan next year</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/09/08  16:36:06</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>CNA Staff Writer</P>
      <P>Taipei, Dec. 9 (CNA) Taiwan's Tseng Ya-ni ascended to a level on the women's
golf tour in the United States in 2008 that has never been achieved by any local
athlete in a professional sport, even surpassing the accomplishments of New York
Yankees starter Chien-Ming Wang.</P>
      <P>But winning the LPGA's Rookie of the Year Award, capturing a grand slam title,
and finishing third on the LPGA money list with prize winnings of US$1.75
million has not swelled Tseng's head.</P>
      <P>In fact, she is already determined to give back to the game and raise Taiwan's
golf profile in the international arena, starting with her backing of an LPGA
event at home along the lines of a U.S. Open or British Open.</P>
      <P>"After playing abroad for the year, I would really like to return to Taiwan to
compete. I would be willing to donate some of my winnings to make the tournament
a reality, " Tseng said in a meeting with local media Monday on a rare return
home.</P>
      <P>Hsu Tien-ya, president of the Sunrise Group that owns the Sunrise Golf &amp;
Country Club in Yangmei in the northern county of Taoyuan and long active in
helping developing young golf talent, estimated such a tournament would require
a US$2 million purse to draw the world's top players and could be held in
October, when the LPGA Tour heads to Asia.</P>
      <P>Tseng said she would be an effective pitchman for such an event.</P>
      <P>"With the relationships I have with other players on tour, I think all of the
world's top 10 players would do me a favor and come play here," she said.</P>
      <P>Tseng's father said the LPGA was receptive to the idea, but scheduling and the
cost of holding the event might make it difficult to pull off such an event in
2009.</P>
      <P>According to the recently released LPGA Tour schedule, a US$1.5 million event
will be held in Hawaii from Oct. 15-18, followed in three consecutive weeks by
tournaments in China, South Korea and Japan that will all offer purses of US$1.4
million or higher.</P>
      <P>The only possibility for Taiwan might be to grab the slot left for the US$1.9
million tournament in China, which has yet to find a title sponsor or course,
according to Golf Digest.</P>
      <P>Also, finding sponsors in today's difficult economic climate for an event with a
US$2 million purse and other expenses, will be a major challenge.</P>
      <P>Local legislators  immediately  jumped on the bandwagon to recommend that the
government back such a tournament, and Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng was
named to head a task force to study the idea.</P>
      <P>The Sports Affairs Council, however, responded coolly to the idea, with the
council's head Tai Hsia-ling noting that the council's entire budget for holding
international competitions in 2009 was only NT$150 million.</P>
      <P>Although the likelihood of holding an LPGA Tour Taiwan Open in 2009 is
uncertain, Tseng's desire to raise the profile of the game and help the country
become more competitive internationally remains real.</P>
      <P>At Monday's press conference, the 19-year-old Tseng pledged to donate a portion
of her winnings to help nurture young golfers have the opportunity to reach the
highest levels of the game.</P>
      <P>Tseng said she could not have achieved her impressive results on the LPGA tour
without the 5 1/2 years from 2002 to 2007 she spent intermittently in Sunrise
Golf &amp; Country Club's live-in training program that came with room and
board.</P>
      <P>Now, she hopes to provide the same opportunities for the next wave of young
Taiwanese golfers.</P>
      <P>Hsu said Tseng could emerge as a role model who inspires other Taiwanese golfers
to have an impact at the professional level, just as the success of five-time
major winner Se-Ri Pak sparked a generation of South Korean women golfers who
took seven of the top 20 spots on the LPGA Tour's money list this year.</P>
      <P>For Tseng, 2008 was a banner year. She became only the sixth Asian to ever win
one of golf's four majors, finished third on the LPGA money list and is
currently ranked second in the world (behind Lorena Ochoa of Mexico).</P>
      <P>No professional athlete from Taiwan has ever attained such a lofty status in his
or her respective sport, but Tseng is not satisfied.</P>
      <P>Her goal next year is to become the first ethnic Chinese to win the LPGA's
Player of the Year award, and maybe, just maybe, play in a big LPGA event on
home soil.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's people just barely passed a latest mental wellness evaluation conducted
by the Mental Health Foundation, with 43 percent of those surveyed not feeling
optimistic about the future.</P>
      <P>The results of the biennial evaluation released Tuesday showed that for 2008,
the levels of mental health of Taiwanese people averaged 80.11, just over the
passing score of 80.</P>
      <P>The score compares with 82.63 in 2006 and 80.60 in 2004 -- the first year the
evaluation was carried out.</P>
      <P>This year's study was conducted between September and October among 1,114 people
around the country.</P>
      <P>On average,  the respondents  measured  79.2 in terms  of psychological and
physical health, 76.3 in personal values, 79.7 in terms of feeling in control of
life, and 85.6 in family wellness.</P>
      <P>Yang Tsung-tsai, head of the psychiatric and psychological center at Cardinal
Tien Hospital, attributed the decline in Taiwanese people's mental health levels
to the impact of several incidents occurring during the period of the
evaluation, including the melamine contamination of milk products and food
ingredients imported from China, and the worsening of the global financial
crisis.</P>
      <P>Among the four areas assessed, all got a failing score except for family
wellness, which indicates that family provides important support for the
public's mental health, Yang said.</P>
      <P>Aspects that remained at especially low levels were effectiveness of one own's
abilities and personal trait, which averaged 65.0; satisfaction with one own's

      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew, presented on Tuesday the top panel award as well as
five separate categories of awards to the winners of the Windows Hardware
Engineering Conference 2008 Awards (WinHEC 2008 Awards).</P>
      <P>During the award ceremony, which took place at the Taipei International
Convention Center, Siew praised Microsoft for working successfully with many
outstanding hardware companies in Taiwan over the past 15 years.</P>
      <P>"It has not only helped Taiwan develop into the worldwide leader of personal
computer manufacturing, but it has also shaped the future of the global
information technology (IT) industry with its partners in Taiwan," Siew said.</P>
      <P>More than 1,000 hardware engineers and experts from Taiwan are attending the
two-day WinHEC, at which Microsoft announced the inaugural awards 16 years after
WinHEC was launched.</P>
      <P>"I truly appreciate Microsoft Taiwan's creation of the WinHEC Award this year,"
said Siew.</P>
      <P>The vice president emphasized that such an initiative would allow Taiwan's
already powerful hardware industry to take further advantage of Microsoft's
global  resources  and international  marketing experience to develop better
products and stronger competitiveness.</P>
      <P>"The Taiwanese government will continue to provide incentives to further
encourage innovation and design in our IT industry, " Siew said, adding that the
i-Taiwan projects include mechanisms to provide financial assistance to those
companies that are interested in participating in the government's Branding
Taiwan plan.</P>
      <P>Promising to continue making available its global marketing resources to help
the winners launch their successful ideas in the global IT market, Davis Tsai,
general manager of Microsoft Taiwan, said that Microsoft has always highly
valued Taiwan's hardware industry, which plays an indispensable, strategic
global role.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that according to the 2008 Branding Taiwan survey conducted by the
Taiwan External Trade Development Council, which was commissioned by the Bureau
of Foreign Trade, the total value of Taiwan's top-20 brands amounted to US$9.141
billion, breaking the US$9 billion mark for the first time.</P>
      <P>"This is evidence of the success of the government's Branding Taiwan  initiative
that  helps  businesses  strengthen  their competitiveness in international
brand marketing," noted Tsai, adding that these top brands are now able to
maintain consumer preference in the face of a global recession and stiff
competition.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the globally unprecedented WinHEC Awards identified 10
oustanding works in five prize categories and a top panel award with the help of
Jan Hung-tse, chairman of PC Home International Co. Ltd, and 10 professional
panelists over the past month.</P>
      <P>Showing  his gratitude  for Siew's presence  at the award presentation ceremony,
Tsai said that the vice president's attendance represented the highest
recognition for the award winners.</P>
      <P>Jan, the chief panelist for the WinHEC Award and a renowned trend guru, noted
that "this year's Microsoft WinHEC Award has really given encouragement to the
Taiwan IT industry."</P>
      <P>Jan said the industry's production quality, design innovation, and cost control
were first class, and that the participants were also considerate of every need
and want of consumers.</P>
      <P>This year's WinHEC Award offered prizes in five categories: Environmental
soundness,  digital media and home entertainment, Internet applications,
technology innovation, and industrial design.</P>
      <P>The winners were Via Technologies, for its green platform, and Asus, for its
Asus N20A notebook computer in the environemntal soundness category; Aiptek, for
its pocketsize multimedia projector, Acer, for its 8920G Blu-ray notebook
computer, and Ipevo, for its Kaleido R 7 Wireless Digital Frame in the digital
media and home entertainment category; Acer, for its Aspire One notebook and
Inventec,  for its Kohjinsha S32 7-inch ultra-portable  tablet computer, in the
Internet application category; Quanta, for its optical touch-control display in
the technology innovation category; and Acer, for its Aspire Predator G700, and
Quanta, for its Digital Operator Phone System in the industrial design category.</P>
      <P>The winner of the top panel award was Aiptek's pocketsize multimedia projector.</P>
      <P>Prior to the awards ceremony Jon DeVaan, senior vice president, Windows Core
Operating System Divison, Microsoft, delivered a keynote speech on the status of
the development of the Windows 7 operating system with his company's IT partners
in Taiwan and demonstrating Windows 7's performance in log-on/off speed, memory

      <P>Taiwan's exports in November fell US$5.09 billion, or 23.3 percent, to US$16.78
billion from a year earlier, the biggest drop since October 2001, the Ministry
of Finance said Monday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, imports in November slid 13.2 percent, or US$2.32 billion, to
US$15.26 billion, the sharpest decline since March 2002, leaving a trade surplus
of US$1.52 billion, Lin Li-jen, chief of the ministry's statistics department
said at a press conference.</P>
      <P>The figures represent a sharp decline of 64.6 precent in the trade surplus in
November compared with the previous month, she added.</P>
      <P>The value of exports for November was the lowest since September 2005, mainly
due to a 25.3 percent decline in the electronics sector, its worst drop since
December 2001. Optical products and electric machinery manufacturers also
recorded a 47.6 percent and a 51.8 percent decline in exports, respectively, the
ministry report showed.</P>
      <P>It also revealed that shipments to China and Hong Kong, which accounted for more
than one-third of Taiwan's exports, fell sharply by a record 38.5 percent, or
US$3.53 billion, to US$5.63 billion from last year.</P>
      <P>Exports to the U.S., Taiwan's second-largest export market, fell 14.2 percent,
while exports to Japan increased 19.2 percent, the report said.</P>

straight month of negative growth in exports, following a 1.6 percent decline in
September and an 8.3 percent drop in October, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>She expressed reservations about Taiwan's export outlook for December and the
first half of next year, saying "it would not turn brighter."</P>
      <P>Other figures also provide further evidence that Taiwan is increasingly reeling
from the effects of the global economic slump. Advanced Semiconductor
Engineering Inc and Siliconware Precision Industries Co, Taiwan's two main
semiconductor packaging and testing service providers, posted record lows of
NT$6.14 billion and NT$4.23 billion, respectively, in business turnover for
November, which represented a 35.8 percent and a 24 percent year-on-year drop,
respectively.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a number of DRAM makers, TFT-LCD manufacturers and IC design
companies also recorded more than 30 percent decline in turnover for November.</P>
      <P>Among them, DRAM maker Nanya Technology and TFT-LCD manufacturer AU Optronics
Corp suffered a whopping 55 percent and 66.8 percent revenue drop in November
compared with October.</P>

      <P>A Mongolian official visited the Taiwan Fund for Children and Families (TFCF) in
the central city of Taichung Monday to express her gratitude to the charity for
its assistance to poor Mongolian children over the past four years, according to
a TFCF official.</P>
      <P>TFCF Chairman Po-Rung Lin received Togtokhnyam Mijiddorj, the head of National

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 68.7 percent of Taiwan's unmarried female office workers do not see
themselves as losers, but instead believe that having a job will help them
achieve greater self-worth, the results of an online survey published Tuesday
found.</P>
      <P>Most of the island's unmarried women choose to stay single because they have not
found a suitable mate to get married with; because they love freedom;  or
because their current economic situation do not allow them to do so, the cyber
poll carried out by the 1111 human resources bank showed.</P>
      <P>According to the job bank's investigation, about 33 percent of the female
workers responding to the survey admitted to eating or shopping alone, envying
husbands and wives who walk hand-in-hand, and despising machismo.</P>
      <P>The sectors with the highest percentage of unmarried women are the information
technology and financial services sectors, as well as the media and publishing
industries.</P>
      <P>These women's long and irregular work hours were seen as the main reason for
their lack of a social life.</P>
      <P>The survey asked the women if they identified with the term "loser dog" -- which
was coined by Japanese author Junko Sakai, referring to women in marriageable
age who remain unmarried and childless.</P>
      <P>The survey's findings mirrored government statistics which showed a trend of
Taiwanese women marrying much later than in previous decades, or not marrying at
all, which is part of the reason for the declining birth rate on the island of
23 million people.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics showed that the ratio of Taiwan's unmarried women in
the 25-39 age group rose to 39.4 percent in 2007, up from 22.5 percent in 1997.</P>
      <P>The women  also tend to be well-educated  and financially independent, and are
unwilling to marry beneath them. Many also do not want to live with or cater to
parents-in-law, which is still expected of them in traditional Taiwanese
society, analysts said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Pandas to attract six million visitors to Taipei zoo: mayor</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 9 (CNA)
12/09/08  18:59:29
(By Andrew Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei City Mayor Hau Lung-bin said on Tuesday that the two giant pandas soon to
arrive from China are expected to attract six million visitors to the Taipei
City Zoo each year.</P>
      <P>"We had five million visitors each year to the zoo to see the koalas in the
past. With the two giant pandas, we estimate at least six million tourists will
visit the zoo every year," said Hau at a press conference with foreign media at
the Eslite Book Store.</P>
      <P>He was referring to domestic visitors as well as overseas tourists.</P>
      <P>The whole of Taiwan saw about 3.7 million overseas visitors last year, although
the Tourism Bureau is trying to raise that figure to 4 million this year.</P>
      <P>Hau believes the pandas will help boost tourism not only for the zoo but for
Taipei.</P>
      <P>"I hope many tourists will come and see the pandas," said Hau.</P>
      <P>He said that the coming of the mainland Chinese pandas is a major sign of
improved cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Hau said that he is expecting the giant pandas to arrive very soon and that the
city is just waiting for the permits to come through and the paperwork to be
processed.</P>
      <P>"The Taipei City Zoo is now fully prepared, " said Hau.</P>
      <P>In addition to pandas, Hau said weekday direct cross-strait flights, which begin
this month, will also make Taipei's business environment better.</P>
      <P>"Our science park in Neihu will be able to attract more international
enterprises to relocate their office to Taipei, " said Hau. "Even with the
global economic downturn, the science park in Neihu District of Taipei is still
booming."</P>
      <P>More than 3,000 companies have relocated their offices to the science park in
Neihu and the total capital invested has reached nearly NT$ 2.3 trillion
(US$0.069 trillion), Hau noted.</P>
      <P>On another front, Hau was questioned by foreign reporters on the issue of the
Maokong Gondola, which is shut down indefinitely due to soil erosion caused by a
typhoon this fall. The city government has been criticized for its handling of
the cable car system's problems.</P>
      <P>"The Taipei City government has done a lot for the gondola," said Hau. "We acted
according to engineer's professional recommendations. We made all the necessary
emergency arrangements. Our major concern is the safety of the residents and
citizens of Taipei."</P>
      <P>"The trouble was due to excessive rain from the typhoon. It was not due to human
error," said Hau, adding that the city hopes to have the gondola safe, up and
running again by June 2009.</P>
      <P>Hau pointed out that the cable car route, built at a cost of NT$1.3 billion
(US$0.039 billion), had already attracted five million tourists.</P>
      <P>"Polls showed that 80 percent of the people in Taipei are happy with it.
Therefore it is a very important Taipei City tourism asset," Hau said, but he
did not specify whether he was referring to polls taken before or after it was
found that the cable car's foundations were unable to withstand Taiwan's
frequent typhoons.</P>
      <P>In the press conference, Hau also touted the honor of Taipei City to hold the
Deaflympics in 2009.</P>
      <P>"In the past, it was held only in the United States and European countries, "
said Hau. "It is first time that the Deaflympics is held in an Asian City.
Taipei is honored to be the first Asian City to hold the Deaflympics."</P>
      <P>Hau added that the Deaflympics will host participants from 81 countries, with
4,000 athletes, which is close to double the number of what it was when
Deaflympics was held in Melbourne in 2005.</P>
      <P>"We hope that the holding of the Deaflympics in Taipei will give a good
impression of the city to foreigners, added Hau. "We have made preparations for
this event and we are sure it will make Taipei shine."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Many children in Taiwan are transported to school by motorcycle everyday without
wearing helmets, which puts them at higher risk of becoming victims in of road
traffic accidents, according to the results of a survey released Tuesday by the
Jing Chuan Child Safety Foundation.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted between mid and late November among 1,409 students from
22 elementary schools around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The results revealed that of the 42.3 percent of children who are transported on
a motorcycle every day, approximately 50 percent seldom or never wear a helmet.</P>
      <P>Seventeen percent of the respondents have had motorcycle accidents, 31.4 percent
of whom were not wearing a helmet at the time.</P>
      <P>The survey found that the low rate of helmet wearing among school children is
closely linked to parents' attitude on the issue.</P>
      <P>Nearly 40 percent of the respondents said their parents do not require them to
wear a helmet, and 21.2 percent said their parents seldom wear a helmet.</P>
      <P>However, 50.5 percent of the children indicated a preference for wearing a
helmet because they feel safer with one, are afraid of being fined, or think a
helmet can shield them from the wind and sun.</P>
      <P>Another 20 percent of the respondents said they hate wearing a helmet because it
makes them feel uncomfortable, makes them sweat, or is too troublesome.</P>
      <P>Nearly 10 percent of the children said they wear a helmet only to avoid being
fined.</P>
      <P>Lin Yueh-chin, assistant executive director of the foundation, called the
public's attention to the safety issues concerning motorcycle riding, as an
increasingly larger number of people are choosing to ride a motorcycles instead
of driving cars at a time when the economy is doing poorly.</P>
      <P>As shown in statistics from the Ministry of Transportation and Communications,
the number of motorcycles in Taiwan rose by an average 34,000 per month during
the first 10 months of this year to a total of 14.32 million, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Among the fatal road traffic accidents in Taiwan, those involving a motorcycle
rider or passenger accounted for 58.9 percent, she said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, statistics from the National Police Agency indicate that in
motorcycle accidents, the death rate among those wearing a a helmet stood at
0.73 percent, which was much lower than the 5.31 percent among those without a
helmet, she noted.</P>
      <P>In an effort to improve the safety of school children, the foundation has
successfully solicited the donation of 240 child helmets by the Rotary Club of
Taipei Tunghua for distribution in seven elementary schools.</P>

      <P>A novel "electric pill" that can generate three watts of electricity to power
portable digital devices has the potential to become a more eco-friendly
alternative to existing batteries, the Industrial Technology Research Institute
(ITRI) reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The only residue of the power generation process is sodium metaborate (NaBO2), a
low-toxic chemical that is much less hazardous to the environment than the
conventional electricity cell, according to the Hsinchu-based institute.</P>
      <P>Tsao Fang-hei, a division chief at ITRI's Energy and Environment Research
Laboratories, explained that when added to a micro fuel cell, the white pills of
concentrated hydrogen can easily produce electricity by interacting with the
catalysts inside the cell.</P>
      <P>"A pill of two to three centimeters in diameter can provide three watts
electricity for at least one hour," said Tsao. The electricity is sufficient to
power a mobile phone or even a laptop computer, he added.</P>
      <P>The ITRI said it is trying to transfer the related technologies to private
manufacturers, and the easy-to-use, easy-to-carry pills may one day become a
better alternative to batteries on the market.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung County Magistrate Huang Chung-sheng has said that the county government
will ask for subsidies from the central government to have a county highway
extended to a mountainous area to provide more convenient travel for local
residents.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks in response to Taichung County Councilor Tsai Cheng-
kuei's request at a council session on Nov. 27.</P>
      <P>Tsai urged  the local government  to ask for the central government's support on
extending Highway No. 4 to the county's eastern township of Tungshih to ease
travel for local residents.</P>
      <P>The highway, which started operation in 2000, begins from Cingshuei township in
the county's west to Fengyuan City, where the county hall is located.</P>
      <P>The part from Fengyuan City to Wufeng township, the county's southernmost area,
is currently under construction, but the road does not cover the county's
eastern area, which includes Tungshih township and Hoping township.</P>
      <P>Huang said he has introduced the county government's plan for road extension to
Transportation and Communications Minister Mao Chi-kuo, and the process of
designing the extension are likely to start next year.</P>
      <P>But he added that he will continue to plea for funding from the central
government to ensure its support on the extension.</P>
      <P>Tsai also asked Huang about the plan to resume operation of the Central Cross-
Island Highway in the county.</P>
      <P>The east-west bound road, which covers mountainous regions from Taichung County,
Nantou County, and Hualien County, was seriously damaged in the 921 earthquake
in 1999, especially the part in Hoping township in eastern Taichung County.</P>
      <P>Restoration efforts were made continuously, but were never completed as rains
and earthquakes and their aftermath have caused parts of the road to collapse.</P>
      <P>Huang said the section from Tungshih township to Guguan Scenic Area in Hoping
township will soon be resumed,  and follow-up restorations will continue section

      <P>At the time, the district court ruled in favor of detaining Ma on grounds that

      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officials urged Taiwanese nationals Tuesday
to be on the alert against scams involving perpetrators from Nigeria by means of
emails.</P>
      <P>Chang Yun-ping, director-general of the ministrys Department of African Affairs,
issued the warning at a regular press briefing, saying that the ministry
received two scam cases in December alone, in which Taiwanese victims were asked
to send valuable products or remittances to Nigeria.</P>
      <P>He added, however, that the ministry had cooperated with the Nigerian police as

commercial hub located in its south, Chang said, adding that fraudsters,
however, commit crimes overseas as well.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has made improvements in its perceived corruption levels, according to
the 2008 Bribe Payers Index (BPI) report issued by Transparency International
(TI) Tuesday, despite wide publicity concerning prosecutors' investigations into
the former first family's alleged bribe-taking, embezzlement and money
laundering scandals.</P>
      <P>TI-Taiwan released the report at a news conference in Taipei on behalf of TI --
a global coalition against corruption based in Berlin -- to coincide with
International Anti-Corruption Day.</P>
      <P>The TI survey assesses the supply side of corruption in 22 of the world's
leading exporting countries, based on interviews with 2,742 senior business
executives in 26 countries. The combined global exports of the 22 countries
represent 75 percent of the world's total.</P>
      <P>The BPI, expressed on a scale of zero to 10, is a measure of how willing a
nation appears to be to comply with demands for corrupt business practices. The
higher the score, the lower the likelihood of companies from the country in
question engaging in bribery when doing business abroad.</P>
      <P>Taiwan received a score of 7.5, sharing the No. 14 spot with South Africa and
South Korea but lagging behind Singapore, which placed ninth along with France
and the United States with a score of 8.1, and Hong Kong, which ranked 13th with
a score of 7.6.</P>
      <P>China ranked 21st with a score of 6.5 among the 22 countries -- only slightly
better than Russia, which placed last with a score of 5.9.</P>
      <P>Topping the list were Belgium and Canada, each with a score of 8.8, followed by
the Netherlands and Switzerland, which shared third place with scores of 8.7,
while Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom placed fifth with scores of 8.6.
Australia ranked eighth with a score of 8.5.</P>
      <P>In TI's 2006 BPI report, Taiwan placed 26th with a score of 5.41 -- one notch
above China's 21st place with a score of 4.94. That survey evaluated 30 leading
exporting countries.</P>
      <P>TI said in a news release that there is evidence that "a number of companies
from major exporting countries still use bribery to win business abroad,
despite awareness of its damaging impact on corporate reputations and ordinary
communities."</P>
      <P>The organization  urged the governments of major exporting countries to redouble
their efforts to enforce existing laws and regulations on foreign bribery. It
also urged companies to adopt effective anti-bribery programs.</P>

      <P>China on Tuesday ordered 1,200 metric tons of Taiwanese oranges which will be
shipped Dec. 15 via the direct cross-Taiwan Strait shipping links to be
inaugurated that same day, according to the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture
(COA).</P>
      <P>COA Secretary-General Hsu Han-ching, who is in Fuzhou in China's Fujian
Province, made the announcement during a telephone interview with the CNA.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, China ordered the oranges at a price of NT$13 (US$0.39)  per
kilogram  and the produce  will be shipped to destinations in the coastal
regions of China next Monday. On that same day, the accords on the opening of
two-way direct daily charter flights and shipping services, inked by Taiwan and
China in early November, will take effect.</P>
      <P>Of the 1,200 metric tons of oranges ordered, 1,000 metric tons will be delivered
from Yunlin County and 200 metric tons from Kaohsiung County, both in southern
Taiwan, in an arrangement that resulted  from  coordinated  efforts  by
agricultural  product distribution companies on both sides of the strait, Hsu
said.</P>
      <P>Asked whether China will buy more Taiwanese fruit in the future, Hsu said this
is a goal that the COA will pursue. China has also shown interest in purchasing
Taiwan's wax apples, pineapples and custard apples, he added.</P>
      <P>According to officials of the COA's Agriculture and Food Agency, the council
hopes that these export efforts will help to boost record low orange prices on
the domestic market.</P>

      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu disclosed Tuesday that consumers who spend their
shopping vouchers -- to be issued by the central government in January -- in his
central city will have a chance to win one of three new cars or even a large
house as an incentive.</P>
      <P>Hu said the Taichung city government will work with local construction companies
to provide a house no smaller than 50 pings (one ping equals 36 square feet)
with a market value of between NT$5 million and NT$10 million for a lucky draw
to be held by the end of February.</P>
      <P>"The lucky winner will have several houses in various styles from which to
choose," Hu said, adding that "the winner can even pick the house facing in his
or her preferred direction."</P>
      <P>The mayor's plan to attract people to spend their consumption vouchers in
Taichung has won the support of many members of the city council.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mayor Hsiao Chia-chi said the city government is prepared to give away
gifts worth a total of NT$20 million, including three cars each worth between
NT$500,000 and NT$1 million.</P>
      <P>Hsiao added that the full details of the draw will be announced between Jan. 7
and Jan. 10.</P>
      <P>"All a person needs to do is spend a required amount in consumption vouchers in
Taichung and collect three stamp marks from Taichung tourist attractions in
order to get a ticket to participate in the draw," he said.</P>
      <P>The government's NT$85.7 billion (US$2.6 billion) budget plan to fund the
shopping voucher program is aimed at stimulating Taiwan's slumping retail sector
and boosting the overall economy.</P>
      <P>The legislature adopted a bill last week authorizing  the government to issue
NT$3,600 (US$108) in consumption vouchers to each Taiwanese citizen, foreign
spouses of Taiwanese citizens and infants born before the end of March 2009.</P>
      <P>The vouchers are expected to be distributed from Jan. 18, a week before the
Lunar New Year holiday. They will be valid until Sept. 30, 2009 and retailers
must claim reimbursement for the vouchers by Oct. 31 of that year.</P>

      <P>Hualien County in eastern Taiwan has launched a series of instant packages of
cooked meat made with the county's non-toxic farming produce, Hualien County
Magistrate Hsieh Shen-shan said Monday.</P>
      <P>The instant packages, with choices of pork, lamb, or beef, were launched by the
Kuangfeng Farmers' Association Nov. 26, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>The association spent two years establishing the country's first non-toxic meat
process plant and has obtained certifications of HACCP--Hazard Analysis and
Critical Control Points and ISO22000 on food safety, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Lin Ching-shui, secretary-general of the farmers' association, said the newly
launched products are low-fat foods and contain no MSG or chemical additives.</P>
      <P>The recipes for the instant packages were designed by Tsai Meng-chen, a
researcher at the country's Food Industry Research and Development Institute,
and Lien Ai-ching, a writer of many famous cookbooks, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Chen Teh-hui, chief of the county's Bureau of Agriculture, expressed the hope
that the launch of the products will attract more support for the county's non-
toxic farming.</P>
      <P>The county's non-toxic farming project, which started five years ago, banned the
use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers in farm produce and antibiotics in
aquaculture products, according to another agriculture official in the county.</P>
      <P>Contract farmlands have to pass tests conducted on soil and water resources for
heavy metal contamination, and products are tested for pesticide residues before
being labeled and put on the market.</P>
      <P>The non-toxic farming project operates under a food safety framework similar to
organic agriculture, except that the project covers a wider range of products,
including fishery products, the official said.</P>
      <P>In addition, non-toxic farming does not require that farmlands lie fallow for
three years before the first planting, although it still requires strict land
quality tests, the official added.</P>

      <P>The National Palace Museum (NPM), in coordination with the government's economic
stimulus plans, is offering steep discounts on a range of items in its gift
shops and on all food in its restaurants during the month of December, its
director Chou Kung-shin said Monday.</P>
      <P>"We want to do what we can to help the economy," Chou said at a press
conference, adding that the museum will also be accepting the shopping vouchers
to be issued to Taiwan citizens by the government next month.</P>
      <P>"With the decline of the economy, the wallets of consumers have also shrunk
quite a bit," said Chou. "In response to the government's call to increase
consumer spending and stimulate the economy, the NPM has come up with a rebate
plan to offer the best discounts on our merchandise."</P>
      <P>Heather Chun-huan Ho, managing director of the NPM shop and restaurant, said at
the press conference that the museum is focusing on the gift giving customs of
local Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>The discounted  items include Huai-su  calligraphy  derived products, ties and
silk scarves, tea mugs, stationery, low-relief bronze pieces, and tea gift sets,
she said, adding that free gift-wrapping service will also be provided.</P>
      <P>"We have selected 150 gift items that are being offered at 10 percent discount,
" Ho said. "Discounts of 40 percent on other items are aimed at students and
other low income groups."</P>
      <P>In addition, Ho said the NPM has designated a 40 percent sales area that will be
maintained until the products are sold out.</P>
      <P>"For art lovers,  this unprecedented  sale is the perfect opportunity to
purchase some valuable artworks, " said Ho. "In addition, there is a series of
27 Huai-su products, such as stationery items, silk scarves, ties, and shawls.
These are favorites among foreign visitors."</P>
      <P>The Huai-su products, with their beautiful calligraphy, have been highly praised
by many corporations, and they make ideal gifts for friends abroad, she added.</P>
      <P>Also on sale will be a variety of other items such as red envelopes, fashionable
products for daily use, various reproductions of calligraphies and paintings,
DVDs on museum artifacts and postcards, Ho said.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, all NPM cafes and restaurants are now offering a 20 percent
discount, she added, urging consumers to consider shopping at the NPM for
Christmas and New Year gifts.</P>
      <P>The National Palace Museum, located in Tienmu, Taipei City, has a one of the
world's largest permanent collections of over 650,000 pieces of ancient Chinese

      <P>The Taipei city government plans to spend NT$20 million (US$596,747) to finance
a feature film that will allow the world to see the unique characteristics of
the northern Taiwanese city, a senior city government official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Yang Hsiao-Tung, spokesman for the city government and director of the
Department of Information and Tourism, disclosed at a discussion with Taiwanese
directors that shooting of the film will hopefully begin in March or April next
year.</P>
      <P>He added that the city government will invite award-winning director Hou Hsiao-
hsien to produce the film and Hsiao Ya-chuan to direct it.</P>
      <P>Yang noted that many cities have left indelible imprints on people's minds
because they served as backdrops in highly successful movies, such as Rome in
the 1953 movie Roman Holiday, New York City in the 2008 film Sex and the City,
London in the 2001 film Bridget Jones's Diary, and Chiufen -- a mountain village
in Taipei County put back on the map because of Hou's 1989 award-winning film, A
City of Sadness.</P>
      <P>More recently, the small town of Hengchun in the southernmost county of Pingtung
became a favorite spot for local holidaymakers because of the box office smash
Cape No. 7, he added.</P>
      <P>Yang said the film should reflect Taipei's beauty, vitality, color and other

    <HEADLINE>Many school children ride motorcycles without helmets: survey</HEADLINE>

      <P>Many children in Taiwan are transported to school by motorcycle everyday without
wearing helmets, which puts them at higher risk of becoming victims in of road
traffic accidents, according to the results of a survey released Tuesday by the
Jing Chuan Child Safety Foundation.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted between mid and late November among 1,409 students from
22 elementary schools around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The results revealed that of the 42.3 percent of children who are transported on
a motorcycle every day, approximately 50 percent seldom or never wear a helmet.</P>
      <P>Seventeen percent of the respondents have had motorcycle accidents, 31.4 percent
of whom were not wearing a helmet at the time.</P>
      <P>The survey found that the low rate of helmet wearing among school children is
closely linked to parents' attitude on the issue.</P>
      <P>Nearly 40 percent of the respondents said their parents do not require them to
wear a helmet, and 21.2 percent said their parents seldom wear a helmet.</P>
      <P>However, 50.5 percent of the children indicated a preference for wearing a
helmet because they feel safer with one, are afraid of being fined, or think a
helmet can shield them from the wind and sun.</P>
      <P>Another 20 percent of the respondents said they hate wearing a helmet because it
makes them feel uncomfortable, makes them sweat, or is too troublesome.</P>
      <P>Nearly 10 percent of the children said they wear a helmet only to avoid being
fined.</P>
      <P>Lin Yueh-chin, assistant executive director of the foundation, called the
public's attention to the safety issues concerning motorcycle riding, as an
increasingly larger number of people are choosing to ride a motorcycles instead
of driving cars at a time when the economy is doing poorly.</P>
      <P>As shown in statistics from the Ministry of Transportation and Communications,
the number of motorcycles in Taiwan rose by an average 34,000 per month during
the first 10 months of this year to a total of 14.32 million, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Among the fatal road traffic accidents in Taiwan, those involving a motorcycle
rider or passenger accounted for 58.9 percent, she said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, statistics from the National Police Agency indicate that in
motorcycle accidents, the death rate among those wearing a a helmet stood at
0.73 percent, which was much lower than the 5.31 percent among those without a
helmet, she noted.</P>
      <P>In an effort to improve the safety of school children, the foundation has
successfully solicited the donation of 240 child helmets by the Rotary Club of
Taipei Tunghua for distribution in seven elementary schools.</P>

      <P>A novel "electric pill" that can generate three watts of electricity to power
portable digital devices has the potential to become a more eco-friendly
alternative to existing batteries, the Industrial Technology Research Institute
(ITRI) reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The only residue of the power generation process is sodium metaborate (NaBO2), a
low-toxic chemical that is much less hazardous to the environment than the
conventional electricity cell, according to the Hsinchu-based institute.</P>
      <P>Tsao Fang-hei, a division chief at ITRI's Energy and Environment Research
Laboratories, explained that when added to a micro fuel cell, the white pills of
concentrated hydrogen can easily produce electricity by interacting with the
catalysts inside the cell.</P>
      <P>"A pill of two to three centimeters in diameter can provide three watts
electricity for at least one hour," said Tsao. The electricity is sufficient to
power a mobile phone or even a laptop computer, he added.</P>
      <P>The ITRI said it is trying to transfer the related technologies to private
manufacturers, and the easy-to-use, easy-to-carry pills may one day become a
better alternative to batteries on the market.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung County Magistrate Huang Chung-sheng has said that the county government
will ask for subsidies from the central government to have a county highway
extended to a mountainous area to provide more convenient travel for local
residents.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks in response to Taichung County Councilor Tsai Cheng-
kuei's request at a council session on Nov. 27.</P>
      <P>Tsai urged  the local government  to ask for the central government's support on
extending Highway No. 4 to the county's eastern township of Tungshih to ease
travel for local residents.</P>
      <P>The highway, which started operation in 2000, begins from Cingshuei township in
the county's west to Fengyuan City, where the county hall is located.</P>
      <P>The part from Fengyuan City to Wufeng township, the county's southernmost area,
is currently under construction, but the road does not cover the county's
eastern area, which includes Tungshih township and Hoping township.</P>
      <P>Huang said he has introduced the county government's plan for road extension to
Transportation and Communications Minister Mao Chi-kuo, and the process of
designing the extension are likely to start next year.</P>
      <P>But he added that he will continue to plea for funding from the central
government to ensure its support on the extension.</P>
      <P>Tsai also asked Huang about the plan to resume operation of the Central Cross-
Island Highway in the county.</P>
      <P>The east-west bound road, which covers mountainous regions from Taichung County,
Nantou County, and Hualien County, was seriously damaged in the 921 earthquake
in 1999, especially the part in Hoping township in eastern Taichung County.</P>
      <P>Restoration efforts were made continuously, but were never completed as rains
and earthquakes and their aftermath have caused parts of the road to collapse.</P>
      <P>Huang said the section from Tungshih township to Guguan Scenic Area in Hoping
township will soon be resumed,  and follow-up restorations will continue section
by section.</P>

      <P>Former Presidential  Office Deputy Secretary-General Ma Yung-cheng was freed on
bail of NT$500,000 Tuesday, after being held in custody since November on
suspicion of involvement in graft.</P>
      <P>The  Taipei  District  Court  granted  permission  to  the anti-corruption
Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutors Office to free Ma,
who is known as the right-hand man of former President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The court however retained its ban on Ma leaving the country or changing his
place of residence.</P>
      <P>Ma was detained on Nov. 4 during a probe into a "special state affairs fund"
misappropriation case involving the former president .</P>
      <P>At the time, the district court ruled in favor of detaining Ma on grounds that
he could tamper with evidence in the case and that he was suspected of
committing a crime that carries a sentence of more than five years in prison.</P>
      <P>Ma was indicted, along with former first lady Wu Shu-jen, in another case on
Nov. 3, 2006 for allegedly helping Wu embezzle NT$14.8  million  in public funds
set aside for the official discretionary use of then President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Chen, who was spared indictment at the time because he had presidential
immunity, was taken into custody Nov. 12 in a probe into his role in that case

      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officials urged Taiwanese nationals Tuesday
to be on the alert against scams involving perpetrators from Nigeria by means of
emails.</P>
      <P>Chang Yun-ping, director-general of the ministrys Department of African Affairs,
issued the warning at a regular press briefing, saying that the ministry
received two scam cases in December alone, in which Taiwanese victims were asked
to send valuable products or remittances to Nigeria.</P>
      <P>He added, however, that the ministry had cooperated with the Nigerian police as
well as Taiwanese businessmen operating there, and have successfully prevented
the products and money from falling into the hands of the fraudsters.</P>
      <P>Fraud cases are most rampant in the Nigerian city of Lagos, the countrys major
commercial hub located in its south, Chang said, adding that fraudsters,
however, commit crimes overseas as well.</P>
      <P>The scam artists usually break into the victims email account and send to the
victims family messages that he or she has been robbed of money and passport and
need immediate monetary assistance in the form of remittances, according to
Chang.</P>

account user, while contacting MOFAs local representative office in the Nigerian
capital of Abuja.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Henry Chen, who had served part of his diplomatic duties in
Nigeria, also warned Taiwanese businesses against the risks of doing trade with
the African country, as he saidthey can fake all kinds of official documents,
including letters of authority.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has made improvements in its perceived corruption levels, according to
the 2008 Bribe Payers Index (BPI) report issued by Transparency International
(TI) Tuesday, despite wide publicity concerning prosecutors' investigations into
the former first family's alleged bribe-taking, embezzlement and money
laundering scandals.</P>
      <P>TI-Taiwan released the report at a news conference in Taipei on behalf of TI --
a global coalition against corruption based in Berlin -- to coincide with
International Anti-Corruption Day.</P>
      <P>The TI survey assesses the supply side of corruption in 22 of the world's
leading exporting countries, based on interviews with 2,742 senior business
executives in 26 countries. The combined global exports of the 22 countries
represent 75 percent of the world's total.</P>
      <P>The BPI, expressed on a scale of zero to 10, is a measure of how willing a
nation appears to be to comply with demands for corrupt business practices. The
higher the score, the lower the likelihood of companies from the country in
question engaging in bribery when doing business abroad.</P>
      <P>Taiwan received a score of 7.5, sharing the No. 14 spot with South Africa and
South Korea but lagging behind Singapore, which placed ninth along with France
and the United States with a score of 8.1, and Hong Kong, which ranked 13th with
a score of 7.6.</P>
      <P>China ranked 21st with a score of 6.5 among the 22 countries -- only slightly
better than Russia, which placed last with a score of 5.9.</P>
      <P>Topping the list were Belgium and Canada, each with a score of 8.8, followed by
the Netherlands and Switzerland, which shared third place with scores of 8.7,
while Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom placed fifth with scores of 8.6.
Australia ranked eighth with a score of 8.5.</P>
      <P>In TI's 2006 BPI report, Taiwan placed 26th with a score of 5.41 -- one notch
above China's 21st place with a score of 4.94. That survey evaluated 30 leading
exporting countries.</P>
      <P>TI said in a news release that there is evidence that "a number of companies
from major exporting countries still use bribery to win business abroad,
despite awareness of its damaging impact on corporate reputations and ordinary
communities."</P>
      <P>The organization  urged the governments of major exporting countries to redouble
their efforts to enforce existing laws and regulations on foreign bribery. It
also urged companies to adopt effective anti-bribery programs.</P>

      <P>China on Tuesday ordered 1,200 metric tons of Taiwanese oranges which will be
shipped Dec. 15 via the direct cross-Taiwan Strait shipping links to be
inaugurated that same day, according to the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture
(COA).</P>
      <P>COA Secretary-General Hsu Han-ching, who is in Fuzhou in China's Fujian
Province, made the announcement during a telephone interview with the CNA.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, China ordered the oranges at a price of NT$13 (US$0.39)  per
kilogram  and the produce  will be shipped to destinations in the coastal
regions of China next Monday. On that same day, the accords on the opening of
two-way direct daily charter flights and shipping services, inked by Taiwan and
China in early November, will take effect.</P>
      <P>Of the 1,200 metric tons of oranges ordered, 1,000 metric tons will be delivered
from Yunlin County and 200 metric tons from Kaohsiung County, both in southern
Taiwan, in an arrangement that resulted  from  coordinated  efforts  by
agricultural  product distribution companies on both sides of the strait, Hsu
said.</P>
      <P>Asked whether China will buy more Taiwanese fruit in the future, Hsu said this
is a goal that the COA will pursue. China has also shown interest in purchasing
Taiwan's wax apples, pineapples and custard apples, he added.</P>
      <P>According to officials of the COA's Agriculture and Food Agency, the council
hopes that these export efforts will help to boost record low orange prices on
the domestic market.</P>
      <P>Orange prices in Taiwan have dipped to a record low of NT$10 per kilogram for
fine quality oranges, and NT$5 per kilogram on average for those of lower
quality produced in the southern regions of the island in a period from November
to April.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin, China's top negotiator with Taiwan, clinched the direct cross-
strait transportation link agreements with his Taiwan counterpart Chiang Pin-
kung in Taipei during an unprecedented visit by Chen to Taiwan last month.</P>
      <P>He promised to purchase locally grown oranges, after he learned of a glut of the
fruit in central and southern Taiwan.</P>

to provide a house no smaller than 50 pings (one ping equals 36 square feet)
with a market value of between NT$5 million and NT$10 million for a lucky draw
to be held by the end of February.</P>
      <P>"The lucky winner will have several houses in various styles from which to
choose," Hu said, adding that "the winner can even pick the house facing in his
or her preferred direction."</P>
      <P>The mayor's plan to attract people to spend their consumption vouchers in
Taichung has won the support of many members of the city council.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mayor Hsiao Chia-chi said the city government is prepared to give away
gifts worth a total of NT$20 million, including three cars each worth between
NT$500,000 and NT$1 million.</P>
      <P>Hsiao added that the full details of the draw will be announced between Jan. 7
and Jan. 10.</P>
      <P>"All a person needs to do is spend a required amount in consumption vouchers in
Taichung and collect three stamp marks from Taichung tourist attractions in
order to get a ticket to participate in the draw," he said.</P>
      <P>The government's NT$85.7 billion (US$2.6 billion) budget plan to fund the
shopping voucher program is aimed at stimulating Taiwan's slumping retail sector
and boosting the overall economy.</P>
      <P>The legislature adopted a bill last week authorizing  the government to issue
NT$3,600 (US$108) in consumption vouchers to each Taiwanese citizen, foreign
spouses of Taiwanese citizens and infants born before the end of March 2009.</P>
      <P>The vouchers are expected to be distributed from Jan. 18, a week before the
Lunar New Year holiday. They will be valid until Sept. 30, 2009 and retailers
must claim reimbursement for the vouchers by Oct. 31 of that year.</P>

      <P>Hualien County in eastern Taiwan has launched a series of instant packages of
cooked meat made with the county's non-toxic farming produce, Hualien County
Magistrate Hsieh Shen-shan said Monday.</P>
      <P>The instant packages, with choices of pork, lamb, or beef, were launched by the
Kuangfeng Farmers' Association Nov. 26, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>The association spent two years establishing the country's first non-toxic meat
process plant and has obtained certifications of HACCP--Hazard Analysis and
Critical Control Points and ISO22000 on food safety, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Lin Ching-shui, secretary-general of the farmers' association, said the newly
launched products are low-fat foods and contain no MSG or chemical additives.</P>
      <P>The recipes for the instant packages were designed by Tsai Meng-chen, a
researcher at the country's Food Industry Research and Development Institute,
and Lien Ai-ching, a writer of many famous cookbooks, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Chen Teh-hui, chief of the county's Bureau of Agriculture, expressed the hope
that the launch of the products will attract more support for the county's non-
toxic farming.</P>
      <P>The county's non-toxic farming project, which started five years ago, banned the
use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers in farm produce and antibiotics in
aquaculture products, according to another agriculture official in the county.</P>
      <P>Contract farmlands have to pass tests conducted on soil and water resources for
heavy metal contamination, and products are tested for pesticide residues before
being labeled and put on the market.</P>
      <P>The non-toxic farming project operates under a food safety framework similar to
organic agriculture, except that the project covers a wider range of products,
including fishery products, the official said.</P>
      <P>In addition, non-toxic farming does not require that farmlands lie fallow for
three years before the first planting, although it still requires strict land
quality tests, the official added.</P>

      <P>The National Palace Museum (NPM), in coordination with the government's economic
stimulus plans, is offering steep discounts on a range of items in its gift
shops and on all food in its restaurants during the month of December, its
director Chou Kung-shin said Monday.</P>
      <P>"We want to do what we can to help the economy," Chou said at a press
conference, adding that the museum will also be accepting the shopping vouchers
to be issued to Taiwan citizens by the government next month.</P>
      <P>"With the decline of the economy, the wallets of consumers have also shrunk
quite a bit," said Chou. "In response to the government's call to increase
consumer spending and stimulate the economy, the NPM has come up with a rebate
plan to offer the best discounts on our merchandise."</P>
      <P>Heather Chun-huan Ho, managing director of the NPM shop and restaurant, said at
the press conference that the museum is focusing on the gift giving customs of
local Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>The discounted  items include Huai-su  calligraphy  derived products, ties and
silk scarves, tea mugs, stationery, low-relief bronze pieces, and tea gift sets,
she said, adding that free gift-wrapping service will also be provided.</P>
      <P>"We have selected 150 gift items that are being offered at 10 percent discount,
" Ho said. "Discounts of 40 percent on other items are aimed at students and
other low income groups."</P>
      <P>In addition, Ho said the NPM has designated a 40 percent sales area that will be
maintained until the products are sold out.</P>
      <P>"For art lovers,  this unprecedented  sale is the perfect opportunity to
purchase some valuable artworks, " said Ho. "In addition, there is a series of
27 Huai-su products, such as stationery items, silk scarves, ties, and shawls.
These are favorites among foreign visitors."</P>
      <P>The Huai-su products, with their beautiful calligraphy, have been highly praised
by many corporations, and they make ideal gifts for friends abroad, she added.</P>
      <P>Also on sale will be a variety of other items such as red envelopes, fashionable
products for daily use, various reproductions of calligraphies and paintings,
DVDs on museum artifacts and postcards, Ho said.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, all NPM cafes and restaurants are now offering a 20 percent
discount, she added, urging consumers to consider shopping at the NPM for
Christmas and New Year gifts.</P>
      <P>The National Palace Museum, located in Tienmu, Taipei City, has a one of the
world's largest permanent collections of over 650,000 pieces of ancient Chinese
artifacts and artworks.</P>

      <P>Yang noted that many cities have left indelible imprints on people's minds

when out in the world, a good citizen. He should be circumspect and truthful. He
should be in sympathy with all men, but intimate with men of moral character. If
he has time and opportunity to spare, after the performance of those duties, he
should then employ them in literary pursuits."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>President supports proposal to revise Detention Act</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  10 (CNA)
12/10/08  12:12:38

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou expressed support Tuesday for a proposal to amend the
Detention Act in a way that would differentiate the treatment of detained
criminal suspects from that for convicts.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks when asked during a TV interview to comment on the current
situation in which detained suspects in Taiwan are treated as if they are
convicts.</P>
      <P>The issue has been widely debated since former President Chen Shui-bian was held
by prosecutors last month to facilitate an investigation into alleged corruption
involving Chen and alleged money laundering by the former first family.</P>
      <P>Ma agreed that there is room for improvement in the situation, noting that the
Detention Act has not undergone any major change since its enactment more than
60 years ago.</P>
      <P>Ma, who has served as a minister of justice, admitted that detained suspects
could be better treated because they have not been found guilty of any crimes.</P>
      <P>Owing to an insufficient number of prisons in Taiwan, however, detention centers
very often also function as prisons, which leads to similar management of the
two different kinds of facilities.</P>
      <P>While some have argued that the pre-trial detention of criminal suspects is a
violation of human rights, Ma pointed out that a similar system has been in
practice in the United States since 1984 to prevent criminal suspects from
committing other crimes before trial, running away or colluding with other co-
conspirators.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, prosecutors are required to obtain permission from a court before
taking any criminal suspects into custody, and in Chen's case, the court only
made a decision after a nine-hour session, which showed how carefully considered
the decision was, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Asked about the possibility of granting Chen a special pardon if he is
convicted, Ma said it was premature to discuss the matter because Chen has not
even been charged. Even if he were formally indicted and put on trial, he should
still be considered innocent before a conviction, Ma added.</P>
      <P>As to whether it is appropriate to take a former president into custody, Ma said
he is also thinking about the issue.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Ma said, he is also wondering if it is proper to allow a
former president to enjoy privileges that normal people do not have.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, Chen has not received any discriminatory treatment in the
detention center, provided with a room and food that are similar to those given
to other inmates.</P>
      <P>Instead of giving special treatment to specific persons, it would be a better
solution to seek to improve the general treatment for detained suspects, he
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EU welcomes Taiwan's accession to WTO gov't procurement accord</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The European Commission,  the top decision-making body of the European Union, on
Tuesday gave a "hearty welcome" to Taiwan's accession to the World Trade
Organization's (WTO's) Government Procurement Agreement (GPA).</P>
      <P>The WTO Committee on Government Procurement formally approved on Tuesday the
accession of Taiwan -- under the name the Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan,
Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu -- to the GPA, giving Taiwan's companies open access to
public contracts in the 40 other GPA economies and vice versa.</P>
      <P>It was the second time in nine days that the European Commission had welcomed
Taiwan's joining the GPA.</P>
      <P>"This GPA accession offers the EU and Taiwan's suppliers access to each other's
public procurement markets, " said Catherine Ashton, the European commissioner
for trade.</P>
      <P>Charlie McCreevy, another commissioner in charge of internal markets,  said that
it has always  been one of the European Commission's goals to have the number of
GPA economies increased, because an enlarged GPA grouping means European
suppliers would have broader access to Taiwan's regular government procurement
projects.</P>
      <P>According  to the European Commission,  Taiwan's government procurement market
totaled in excess of 120 billion euros (NT$5.2 trillion) over the past 10 years,
with European companies taking a 3 percent market share worth about 3.7 billion
euros.</P>
      <P>The WTO plurilateral GPA was first negotiated during the Tokyo Round and entered
into force on Jan. 1, 1981. Its purpose is to open up as many public contracts
as possible to international competition.</P>
      <P>The agreement is designed to make laws, regulations, procedures and practices
regarding government procurement more transparent and to ensure they do not
protect domestic products or suppliers, or discriminate against foreign products
or suppliers.</P>

      <P>Health Minister Yeh Ching-chuan said Wednesday that a plan submitted by the
Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) to give bureau employees a year-end
bonus equal to 3.8 months of salary has been rejected.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting, Yeh said he has
already asked the bureau to come up with a new plan within two weeks.</P>
      <P>At the meeting, Yeh was grilled over whether the BNHI would maintain its
tradition of paying higher-than-normal year-end bonuses to its staff in the face
of an economic recession and the bureau's snowballing operational deficit.</P>
      <P>According to a statement made by Yeh in early November, the BNHI's deficit for
this year may top NT$26 billion (US$776.12 million), and the bureau has
estimated that next year's deficit will be more than NT$20 billion.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Wednesday that because Taiwan is heavily dependent
on key infrastructure for its future development, he has asked government
agencies to give priority to strengthening the protection of the country's
infrastructure to ensure homeland security.</P>
      <P>Since the 9/11 terror attacks, all nations in the world are placing emphasis on
homeland security, said Liu during his address to the 2008 International
Conference on Homeland Security and Technology in Taipei.The government has the
responsibility to protect the property and lives of its people.</P>
      <P>Liu suggested that Taiwan faces a much lower risk of a terrorist attack than
some other countries but that it is still heavily reliant on its gas and
electrical facilities for its economic activity.</P>
      <P>"The daily lives of our people also rely on these important facilities,the
premier said.</P>
      <P>In addition to gas and electrical facilities, the government also considers the
financial system and Internet network as key components of the country's
infrastructure.</P>
      <P>If we encounter natural or man-made disasters, it will cause great harm to the
nation, including to our stock market and trading activities,Liu contended.</P>
      <P>He said he has already requested all relevant government agencies to develop in-
depth risk assessments of the nation's key public facilities.</P>
      <P>I am asking all government agencies to strengthen security measures and the
protection  of these key components  of our infrastructure,Liu said.</P>
      <P>The premier has also asked the Council for Economic Planning and Development,
the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Defense, to increase
cooperation on security issues with other countries and create commercial
opportunities in the area of security and infrastructure protection.</P>
      <P>The 2008 International Conference on Homeland Security and Technology is being
held so that Taiwan can exchange its experiences, views and policies on national
infrastructure protection and security with other countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GPA accession will have little impact on Taiwanese businesses: agency</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organization's (WTO's) Government
Procurement Agreement (GPA) will have little impact on domestic businesses in
the initial stages, the Cabinet-level Public Construction Commission (PCC) said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The commission reasoned that Taiwan was already an open market for foreign
bidders and suppliers before the country was admitted as a full member of the
GPA a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Between 2005 and 2007, PCC officials said, foreign bidders won 26.87 percent of
all contracts on public procurement projects in Taiwan, reflecting the fact that
the country's public procurement markets are already "very open."</P>
      <P>The officials quoted international tallies as indicating that foreign suppliers
won 13.8 percent of the public procurement contracts in Japan in 2002, while the
figure relating to the United States for 1999 stood at a mere 5.3 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  they  noted,  the WTO Committee  on Government Procurement's formal
approval on Tuesday's accession of Taiwan to the GPA -- under the name of
Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu -- also gave
Taiwanese companies open access to public contracts in the 40 other GPA
economies.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan's favor, they went on, GPA accession offers local suppliers access to
the U.S. government procurement market, worth in excess of US$300 billion
annually.</P>
      <P>The WTO multilateral GPA was first hammered out during the WTO Tokyo Round of
negotiations and entered into force Jan. 1, 1981. Its purpose is to open up as
many public contracts as possible to international competition.</P>
      <P>The agreement is designed to make laws, regulations, procedures and practices
regarding government procurement more transparent and to ensure they do not
protect domestic products or suppliers, or discriminate against foreign products
or suppliers.</P>

      <P>Speaking at the opening ceremony of the TechnoCulture Exposition, which is being

technology and its cultural diversity, the country  should encourage  more

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's security focus should be natural disasters: U.S. expert</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan's critical infrastructure protection policies should focus on the threat
natural disasters pose to the country's key facilities, asserted Paul
Rosenzweig, the U.S. deputy assistant secretary of homeland security, at a
conference in Taipei Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Rosenzweig  said  that  threats  to  a  nation's  critical infrastructure  arise
not only from man-made causes,  such as terrorism, but also from natural
disasters.</P>
      <P>The United States has just been through the hurricane season. Taiwan has also
just passed through the typhoon season. These are all threats to a nation's
security,Rosenzweig explained at the International Conference on Homeland
Security and Technology.</P>
      <P>Rosenzweig stressed that the essence of critical infrastructure protection (CIP)
is to identify which facilities are vulnerable to natural disasters, or even
terrorist attacks, and then work out a strategy to protect them.</P>
      <P>For Taiwan, natural disasters top all other threats to its infrastructure. This
is what Taiwan should take into account for its CIP policy," he said.</P>
      <P>American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Director Stephen Young said, however, that
maintaining the continued security of the global trading system was also
important to Taiwan and the U.S., and he noted that Washington and Taipei have
cooperated closely in this area.</P>
      <P>"The challenge is to maintain the openness and vibrancy of our economic and
commercial ties while ensuring that this openness cannot be used against us,"
Young said.</P>
      <P>One joint program put in place in 2005, Young said, is the Container Security
Initiative (CSI) , which ensures the safety of goods flowing from and through
the U.S. and Taiwan, and expedites the flow of Taiwan's own shipments to the
U.S.</P>
      <P>The CSI primarily targets terrorist activity but also can detect other forms of
illicit activity. For instance, Young said, U.S. and Taiwan Customs officers
have stopped shipments  of contraband, including precursor drugs, counterfeit
currency, and products that violate intellectual property rights, through the
initiative.</P>
      <P>Another program mentioned by Young was the Megaports Initiative, established in
2003, to prevent terrorists from smuggling nuclear or other radioactive
materials through commercial shipping channels.</P>
      <P>Taiwan began working with the U.S. to implement the program in 2006.</P>
      <P>"This high-tech scanning has minimal impact on port operations but facilitates
trade by increasing the security of seaports. This cooperation is a potent
symbol of our commitment to international maritime security," Young said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also cooperates with the U.S.  on export controls, especially in the area
of enforcement, technology transfers and transshipment under the U.S. Export
Control and Related Border Security program, Young said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's recent development of electronic passports is also welcomed by
Washington, Young said, noting that the more secure a nation's travel documents,
the more able it is to protect itself from international terrorist and criminal
activity.</P>
      <P>He warned, however, that Taiwan's efforts to introduce the new passport needed
to be "matched by a corresponding strengthening of application procedures so
passports are not inadvertently issued to people who are not Taiwan citizens."</P>
      <P>Though trade and the free movement of goods are critical to Taiwan's economy,
the greatest blows to its infrastructure have come at home, and Rosenzweig
suggested that Taiwan needed a risk-based approach that was flexible.</P>
      <P>The U.S. had learned in New Orleans how serious a natural disaster could be if
local infrastructure could not withstand the forces of nature.</P>
      <P>The bottom line is that there is no quick approach in addressing the issue of
protection for a nations infrastructure, Rosenzweig said.A risk-based approach
is needed. We have to put money where it is needed the most.</P>
      <P>If a protection strategy is not cost effective, he said, "then the government
has to say you can't build such and such here.</P>
      <P>The U.S.  Department  of Homeland Security has created 18 sector-specific CIP
plans, each with its own governing council, ranging from information technology
and energy facilities, to dams and most recently to automakers, heavy equipment
manufacturers and steel producers.</P>
      <P>We recognize that there can't be a one-size fit-all program on how to protect
our infrastructure, Rosenzweig said.What you need to protect a dam is different
from what you need to protect IT systems.</P>

      <P>First lady Chow Mei-ching visited Taitung Wednesday mainly to tell stories to
aboriginal school children in that eastern county.</P>
      <P>Dressed in a black pantsuit, the self-effacing Chow visited the National Museum
of Prehistory in Taitung City, where she met students from the Chia Na
Elementary School, which has a majority student body from the indigenous tribe
of Bunun. She also met with pupils from the Chang Ping Elementary School, which
is attended mainly by students from the indigenous Amis tribe.</P>
      <P>Most of the museum staff did not know of the first lady's visit until they saw
her entering the building.</P>
      <P>To the Bunun school children, Chow told a story about clouded leopards and black
bears -- animals that legendarily existed in Taiwan and are said to be on the
brink of extinction.</P>
      <P>To the Amis children, Chow, who retired as a legal expert from a state-run bank
a couple of months ago, told a story about a youth from the aboriginal tribe of
Siraya tribe in southern Taiwan and his friends.</P>
      <P>Sixth-grader Huang Pei-hsin told the CNA that she was so excited Tuesday night
she could hardly sleep after she learned that the "Aunt Chou" who was going to

      <P>Over the past several months since Ma took office on May 20, Chow has traveled

to bring them cheer.</P>

      <P>Taiwan-based department store chain Shin Kong Mitsukoshi has applied for
arbitration in Hong Kong to settle a dispute over management rights in a Beijing
joint venture in which it is involved, the company announced in a statement
issued Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Shin Kong Mitsukoshi and the Beijing Haulian Group set up their joint venture
department store -- Shin Kong Place -- in China's capital in April 2007, with
total investment of 750 million yuan (US$109.3 million) and each party holding
50 percent of the shares.</P>
      <P>Anonymous department store industry sources said the fact that the Taiwanese
company did not take a majority stake in the joint venture meant that from the
very beginning, business disputes were inevitable.</P>
      <P>The dispute erupted when Beijing Hualian Group, suspecting problems involving
construction payments, raided the department store with 200 security guards,
fired most of the Taiwanese executives for allegedly taking bribes and took over
management of the department store last August.</P>
      <P>Wu Shin-da, general manager of Shin Kong Mitsukoshi's Beijing operation, was
detained by Chinese security officials just as he was about to board a plane for
Taiwan, a move that caused a stir among Taiwanese businessmen in China, as well
as the Japanese department store sector.</P>
      <P>Following  the incident,  Beijing Haulian Group refused to negotiate with Wu,
prompting Shin Kong Mitsukoshi Chairman Wu Tung-hsing to embark on a marathon
negotiating session lasting more than 10 hours in Beijing in September 2007 with
his Chinese counterpart, Ji Xiaoan, in a vain attempt to work out a way for
further cooperation.</P>
      <P>In recent years, Shin Kong Mitsukoshi -- a merger between the Taiwanese group
and Japanese retail giant Mitsukoshi Ltd. -- is said to have been trying
unsuccessfully to attract foreign investment in the Beijing department store.</P>
      <P>Owing to differences in opinion on operation and management between the two
companies, Shin Kong Mitsukoshi has made great efforts to communicate with its
Chinese counterpart in an attempt to continue with the partnership, but the
Beijing company has constantly broken contracts  and has illegally  infringed on
Shin Kong's management rights, the Taiwanese company said, hence the need to
resort to legal action.</P>

      <P>Like a viral infection, the recession has spread to all facets of Taiwan's
business sector, even the humble recycling business, in which several thousand
individuals who collect recyclable waste are threatened by a plunge in the
prices of recyclable resources.</P>
      <P>Recyclable resource prices have fallen from a peak at the beginning of this year
and bottomed out in October. At present, scrap iron -- which previously sold for
NT$20 (US$0.03) per kilogram -- now only fetches NT$2 or NT$3 per kilo.</P>
      <P>Waste paper has not fared much better, with the price plummeting from NT$4-NT$5
per kilogram to just NT$0.5-NT$1, sighed one recycler Wednesday in Tainan
County, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Things are even bleaker in central Taiwan, where the price of scrap iron has
slid to even less than NT$2 per kilogram, while the price for used PET bottles
-- one of the most valuable recyclable waste items -- has also dropped from
NT$20 per kilogram to just NT$6.</P>
      <P>Lin Yu-hsin, the owner of the Da Gang resource recycling company in Kaohsiung
City, southern Taiwan, told CNA that his company's recycling volume has
plummeted by two thirds over the past four months, as has turnover.</P>
      <P>"It is too painful to talk about, " Lin said, noting that some of his
competitors have been forced to close.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, life for the some 9,000 individual recyclable waste collectors around
Taiwan -- who are mostly old, poor and lack job skills -- has become even
harder.</P>
      <P>"They might not be able to earn even NT$20 for a mountain of waste paper they
have sweated to collect in the alleys and streets, " said Lin Chien-huei of the
Recycling Fund Management Board (RFMB) under the Cabinet-level Environmental
Protection Administration (EPA).</P>
      <P>According to RFMB data, prices for recyclable waste started to climb in late
2004 and reached a peak in June this year.</P>
      <P>Taking copper -- one of the most valuable resources in the manufacturing
industry -- as an example, Lin pointed out that the price of scrap copper stood
at more than US$3,000 per ton in 2004, and had climbed to over US$8,000 per ton
as of June 2008.</P>
      <P>Now, copper only fetches US$4,000 per ton, Lin said.</P>
      <P>In the case of plastic, he went on, the price was NT$37 per kilogram in 2004,
and reached NT$57 per kilogram in June before dropping to NT$46 in October.</P>
      <P>According to EPA forecasts, recycling prices will improve in about six months to
one year, and until the recession ends, Lin said the government has prepared
relief programs to help tide businesses and individual waste collectors over the
lean times.</P>
      <P>In one such program, the EPA has decided to enroll 700 individual waste
collectors, deploying them at local government-run recycling departments to
serve as "recycling assistants."</P>
      <P>They will be offered NT$9,900 per month in return for working four hours per
day, 22 days per month, according to the EPA.</P>
      <P>Although the money is not much, it might actually help those in urgent need, Lin
said.</P>

      <P>A leading wine critic and vigneron in Australia is visiting Taipei on a four-day
trip as part of an initiative of the Australian Commerce and Industry Office in
Taipei (ACIO) to promote premium Australian wine to local consumers.</P>
      <P>James Halliday has written or co-authored over 60 books on wine since 1979,
including "Oxford Companion to Wine" and "Larousse Encyclopedia of Wine," two of
Australia's favorite wine titles.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is a very important wine market for us," said ACIO Senior Trade
Commissioner Yvonne Chan, noting that Halliday's experience and capacity to
teach consumers and wine writers about the subtleties and strengths of a wider
range of Australian wine varieties could further boost Australian wine exports
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chan also said that Australia is Taiwan's second-largest source of wine imports,
adding  that A$9.5 million  (about  US$6.28 million) -worth of its wine was
imported to Taiwan between 2007 and 2008, accounting for 11 percent of Taiwan's
total wine market.</P>
      <P>The strengths of Taiwan as an export destination for Australian wine exporters
are often misunderstood, Chan continued, pointing out that Taiwan is Australia's
eighth-largest trading partner and adding that per capita and companies-to-
market comparisons indicate that Taiwan can offer an easier first option in the
region.</P>
      <P>Halliday, who arrived in Taipei Tuesday, said he has long believed that the
future of Australian wine lies in Asia, emphasizing that with the history and
romance of wine linked to perceptions that Europe is the favorite source of the
best quality wines, there is still a lot of work to be done to help consumers in
Taiwan -- as well as other Asian countries -- understand that premium Australian
wines can compete with the world's best.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has an affluent consumer demographic well-acquainted with quality wine,
" Halliday said, adding that with only one day in Taipei, the city has already
made a big impact on him.</P>
      <P>"The sophistication of the Taiwanese lifestyle and society is far greater than I
expected," he went on.</P>
      <P>Halliday said he is also keen to help consumers understand that Australian
wines, which often use screw caps, are less likely to be tainted by the cork
mold that spoils around 10 percent of all wines and affects the taste of an even
greater percentage of cork-bottled wine.</P>
      <P>"Australia has taken the international lead on screw-top caps, which are
incorrectly perceived by many consumers in Asia as a sign of poor quality," he
said.</P>
      <P>"In fact, screw-tops should be seen as being of particular value to buyers of
premium and aged wines because they protect producers, distributors, retailers
and consumers alike from cork taint and oxidation," Halliday said.</P>
      <P>Two events will be held during Halliday's stay in Taiwan -- a tasting night for
Taiwanese industry stakeholders and a dinner for local wine lovers in which
Australian wines will be matched to a selection of fine cuisine.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ma calls for legislative endorsement of human rights covenants</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  10  (CNA)
12/10/08  18:48:18
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou called on the Legislative Yuan Wednesday to give its
long-delayed endorsement to two international human rights documents to help
implement human rights protection in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Referring to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights that were
introduced by the United Nations in 1966 and came into force in 1976, Ma said
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will again present the covenants to the
Cabinet during a weekly Cabinet meeting Thursday, to highlight the importance
Taiwan attaches to human rights.</P>
      <P>After that, the documents will be forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for review,
Ma said.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while addressing the presentation of the 2008 Asian
Democracy and Human Rights Award, an annual event organized by the Taiwan
Foundation for Democracy to mark Dec.10 International Human Rights Day.</P>
      <P>The winner of this year's award is Sima Samar, chairwoman of the Afghan
Independent Human Rights Commission and founder of the Shuhada Organization, a
non-government group dedicated to the welfare and progress of Afghan people
residing inside and outside of Afghanistan, with a primary focus on the
empowerment of women and girls.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that although the Republic of China signed the treaties before losing
its U.N. membership in 1971, they have never been endorsed by the country's
legislature over the ensuing 40 years.</P>
      <P>During the eight-year  Democratic  Progressive  Party (DPP) administration that
ended earlier this year, the covenants were submitted by the Cabinet to the
legislative for endorsement four times, none of which were successful, Ma went
on.</P>
      <P>The president said the legislature's endorsement is essential before Taiwan can
move on to the next steps -- seeking to deposit its ratifications of the two
covenants with the United Nations and implementing them in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Realizing the difficulties involved in seeking to deposit the ratifications with
the United Nations without membership in the organization, Taiwan did not try
soliciting legislative endorsement of the covenants until the pro-independence
DPP came to power in 2000.</P>
      <P>The move, however, gave rise to fears that the covenants -- which promise the
right of self-determination for all peoples -- could boost a bid by pro-
independent activists to promote a plebiscite on the issue of independence vs.
unification with China and escalate tension across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The covenants therefore failed to win the support of the then-opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party, which together held a majority in the
legislature during the eight years in which the DPP was in power.</P>
      <P>With Ma's strong support for the ratification of the covenants, it remains to be
seen if his ruling KMT, which now controls two-thirds of the legislative seats,
will change its attitude on the issue.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the matter, MOFA spokesman Henry Chen said his ministry will step
up its communication with the legislators to facilitate early ratification of
the covenants and further Taiwan's achievements in human rights protection.</P>
      <P>Also during Wednesday's ceremony, Ma said Taiwan's improvements in its human
rights record over the past 15 years have greatly impressed world human rights
groups, with Taiwan's status having been changed from that of a "partly free"
country to a "free" country.</P>
      <P>He added that thanks to the government's continued efforts to uphold human
rights, Taiwan has now become "the world's freest country" in terms of the
people's right to assembly, which he said was very well demonstrated by several
protests at the ceremony in support of a variety of causes.</P>
      <P>The  protesters  included  several  supporters  of  Tibetan independence who
were there to express their opposition to Ma's recent rejection of a proposed
visit to Taiwan by the Dalai Lama, and an activist against the government's
recent relocation  of a sanatorium for leprosy patients.</P>

      <P>Population structures of butterfly species on Orchid Island off the east coast
of Taiwan have been changing, possibly as a result of climate change, a
biologist said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Jason Yeh, director of the Taipei Zoo, told reporters that a butterfly research
team of zoo workers and students from National Taiwan University and National
Taiwan Normal University has monitored butterfly communities on Orchid Island
for two years and has found an apparent change in the population structure of
various species.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the population of Catopyrops ancyra almora -- a lycaenid butterfly
originating in the Philippines -- has established a stable foothold on Orchid
Island after the species was first discovered there in 1998.</P>
      <P>He also noted that on Nov. 23, the research team, working with two biologists
from Japan, caught a tagged blue-mottled butterfly, or Parantica sita niphonica,
that had been released from the island of Kamigoto in Nagasaki Prefecture,
southwestern Japan.</P>
      <P>It was the second time a tagged butterfly of this species released in Kamigoto
was found to have made a long-distance migration to Orchid Island, with the
first sighting reported in 2007.</P>
      <P>Parantica sita niphonica, also known as the chestnut tiger butterfly, is a
medium-sized species with a wingspan that can reach 10 centimeters. It has semi-
transparent blue spots on its wings.</P>
      <P>Large numbers of this species can be found between May and July on Yangming
Mountain and Datun Mountain in northern  Taiwan's Yangmingshan National Park.</P>
      <P>Since 2000, Taiwanese and Japanese lepidopterists have worked together to
investigate how the little, fragile creatures can travel more than 2,000
kilometers across the ocean between Taiwan and Japan.</P>
      <P>In recent years, at least four tagged butterflies released in Taiwan have been
retrieved in Japan, while six tagged in Japan have been discovered in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cross-strait detente serves Japan's interests: KMT chief</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Improving Taiwan-China relations will help to reduce tensions and create peace
in the region, serving the interests of Japan and Asia as a whole, Taiwan's
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) chairman said in Tokyo Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Based on the opinion of the majority in Taiwan, President Ma Ying-jeou has a
clear policy to maintain the status quo in the Taiwan Strait, but conditions are
not yet ripe for the two sides to talk about unification," said Wu Poh-hsiung.</P>
      <P>The KMT chairman made the remarks while explaining the KMT's policies  and the
purpose  of his current visit to Japan to international reporters at a news
conference sponsored by the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan. Taiwan's top
representative to Japan John C. T. Feng was also present.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the Ma administration will not support independence for Taiwan
because that would lead to war with China.</P>
      <P>Both the United States and Japan are in favor of cross-strait detente, and
Taiwan is committed to making peace in the region, rather than creating trouble,
he said.</P>
      <P>However, to maintain its self-defense and safeguard cross-strait peace, Taiwan
will continue to purchase weapons from the United States, he stated.</P>
      <P>President Ma attaches great importance to Taiwan's special partnership with
Japan, Wu said, adding that his own visit to Japan in his capacity as KMT
chairman is aimed at helping to step up two-way interactions with various
sectors in Japan.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the controversy over the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands, an
uninhabited island group in the East China Sea which is claimed by Taiwan, China
and Japan, Wu stressed that Taiwan and Japan should set aside sovereignty
disputes and handle the issue peacefully through mutually beneficial joint
development, particularly in the area of fishing rights.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, on the upcoming fourth forum to be held by the KMT and the Communist
Party of China in Shanghai Dec. 20-21, Wu said the two sides are expected to
discuss economic cooperation to deal with the current economic recession.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will also be willing to collaborate with Japan to tackle the financial
turmoil, he added.</P>
      <P>Turning to the Tibet issue, Wu said that in accordance with the Republic of
China Constitution, Taiwan authorities will not support the Tibet independence
movement.</P>
      <P>Wu will proceed to Yokohama Thursday where he will call on the city's mayor,
Hiroshi Nakada, and meet with representatives of the Taiwanese community there
before heading to Kobe and Osaka where he will have a similar agenda.</P>
      <P>Wu paid a call on Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara Monday at the Tokyo City Hall
and relayed President Ma's desire for better ties between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Wu arrived in Japan Sunday at the head of a 15-member delegation on his first
visit to the country in his capacity as leader of Taiwan's ruling party.</P>
      <P>He is slated to return to Taiwan Saturday.</P>
      <P>Japan, a long-term close ally of Taiwan in the region despite the lack of formal
diplomatic ties between the two countries, has been wary of the warming
relations between Taiwan and China since Ma came to power in May.</P>

      <P>The mass rapid transit (MRT) line that is being built to connect Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport and metropolitan  Taipei  is scheduled  to be completed
by 2014, transportation officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The new facility will offer travelers faster and more convenient transportation
services, cutting the distance between Taipei City and the country's main
airport to 35-minutes, from the current average 45 minutes by bus, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>Once the MRT line goes into operation, the officials noted, there will be a 25
percent drop in the number of privately owned automobiles entering the airport
and a 20 percent decline in the number of regular buses operating on the airport
route.</P>
      <P>The metro system, currently under construction, will alleviate traffic
congestion between Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and Taipei, aviation
police said.</P>
      <P>Aviation Police Office statistics show that the traffic flow toward the airport
averages 30,000 vehicles a day. Road traffic around the terminals is usually
jammed during the peak flight periods at the airport, the police said.</P>
      <P>According to the Bureau of High Speed Rail which is in charge of the MRT
project, work on the section of metro line between the airport and Sanchong in
Taipei County has been on schedule.</P>
      <P>However, completion of the underground section between Sanchong and Taipei will
be delayed until October 2014 due to the challenging underground work, the
bureau said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Southwest Taiwan's agricultural-based Yunlin county organized an "Orange Day"
activity Wednesday in an all-out effort to promote the homegrown produce amid a
glut and severe drop in prices.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, county Magistrate Su Chih-fen and the county's agricultural bureau
chief Lu Cheng-chang visited Gukeng township in eastern Yunlin, which is a major
orange production area in Taiwan, and urged the public to consume more oranges
during the current high season.</P>
      <P>They also promised to help sell the produce to overseas markets, including
China, through direct channels.</P>
      <P>From Dec. 15 - Jan. 25, Taiwanese consumers can buy fine-quality oranges from
Yunlin at 120 specially designated venues across the country, Lu said.</P>
      <P>According to Su, some 3,500 hectares of farmland in Yunlin are reserved for
cultivating oranges -- which could yield more than 80,000 metric tons of the
fruit per year.</P>
      <P>The amount of oranges produced is apparently more than the domestic market can
consume, as more growers have dedicated to cultivating the fruit in recent
years.</P>
      <P>Lu said the Yunlin county government will explore more feasible ways to sell
local oranges to the whole world, including Southeast Asia, Europe and the
United States.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, China ordered 1,200 metric tons of Taiwanese oranges at above market
prices, in keeping with a promise made by visiting Chinese negotiator Chen
Yunlin during his historic visit to Taiwan last month.</P>
      <P>Chen made the promise as a goodwill gesture and to alleviate the pressure on
orange growers after he learned of a glut of the fruit in central and southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Of the 1,200 metric tons of oranges China ordered, 1,000 metric tons will be
delivered from Yunlin County and 200 metric tons from Kaohsiung County, also in
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>China ordered the oranges at a price of NT$13 (US$0.39) per kilogram. Orange
prices in Taiwan have dipped to a record low of NT$10 per kilogram for fine
quality oranges, and NT$5 per kilogram on average for those of lower quality
produced in the southern regions of the island from November to April.</P>
      <P>Some of the local growers prefer to let their oranges become ripe and fall to
the ground, instead of harvesting them due to a lack of profit.</P>

      <P>New rules for foreign students, including Taiwanese, applying to study in the
United Kingdom will take effect beginning next March in time for the 2009 summer
season, the Taipei-based British Trade and Cultural Office (BTCO) said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Under the new measures, students will be required by a sponsor school licensed
by the U.K. Border Agency to apply for a visa, Nick Jagger, head of BTCOs
British Assistance &amp; Services Section, explained in a press conference.</P>
      <P>Along with the requirement, Jagger said that all British public as well as
private schools of all levels that intend to recruit overseas students from non-
European Economic Area will also be evaluated on whether they meet the
governments criteria to be issued a license.</P>
      <P>BTCO Deputy Director Charles Garrett said that the initiative will ensure the
quality of education received by overseas students, while helping the British
government stamp out bogus schools.</P>
      <P>The list of schools qualified to receive the license will be released in the
near future, he added.</P>
      <P>Under the points-based system (PBS) introduced by the U.K. in June, there are
five tiers, or categories, for visa applications: Tier 1Vhighly skilled
individuals; Tier 2Vskilled individuals with job offer; Tier 3Vlow skilled
individuals; Tier 4 Vstudents; and Tier 5Vyouth mobility and temporary workers.</P>
      <P>Jagger said that students who attend a licensed sponsor school will be granted
up to four months of extended stay permission, during which they can apply to
switch to a Tier 1 visa if they wish to remain in the U.K. to find work after
their studies.</P>
      <P>He noted, however, that if students decide to travel back to their home country,
but later decide to go back to the U.K., they will also be eligible to apply for
a Tier 1 visa within 12 months of graduation, which, if enoughpointsare
collected on the U.K.'s points-based system assessment, will allow them to stay
two years in the European country.</P>
      <P>Jagger expressed his hopes that the plan for the student-tier of the system will
attract more students to consider studying in the U.K., and enhance their
willingness to remain in the country after graduating so they can contribute to
the British society by working there.</P>
      <P>According to the BTCO, the PBS was introduced to control immigration to the
country and streamline the visa application process.</P>
      <P>In the past, applicants would have to first apply to the Home Office in the U.K.
and then go to the BTCO to apply for a visa if they pass the Home Office review
process.</P>
      <P>Also, with the PBS, applicants are able to do an online self-assessment before
applying to enable them to calculate whether or not they are likely to meet the
number of points required to be issued a visa.</P>
      <P>Points will be awarded according to an objective criteria such as
qualifications, previous earnings, competence in the English language and
ability to support themselves and their dependents.</P>
      <P>Tier 1 under the PBS was first implemented by the end of June, which Tier 2 and
Tier 5 took effect last month. No date has yet been set yet for Tier 3 to be
activated, according to BTCO.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan's Health, Environment and Labor committee completed its
first review of a draft amendment to the Law on the Control of Communicable
Diseases, which aims to establish a national vaccine fund, improve health care
in Taiwan, and boost the country's competitiveness in the fields of public
health and medicine, the Department of Health (DOH) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The amendments allow for the establishment of a national vaccine fund for the
purchase of vaccines and the implementation of national inoculation policies.</P>
      <P>The bill has to be sent to the full legislature for further discussion and
examination.</P>
      <P>If the bill is passed by the legislature, a budget to purchase vaccines will be
available from the year following the establishment of the vaccine fund.</P>
      <P>Revenue for the fund will be drawn from government budgets, the health and
welfare tax on tobacco, earnings from the public welfare lottery, and donations.
Donors, however, will not be allowed to specify which vaccines should be
purchased from the fund.</P>
      <P>Once the bill is passed, the Cabinet-level DOH will have a stable fund from
which to pay for its procurement of vaccines and ancillary items and will thus
be able to ensure a stable supply.</P>
      <P>The items that could be purchased under the fund will be discussed with a view
to avoiding conflicts of interests.</P>
      <P>DOH Minister Yeh Ching-chuan said in a Legislative Yuan committee meeting that
currently, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has a budget of only NT$400
million to buy vaccines that are offered to the public by the government.</P>
      <P>"With the establishment of a national vaccine fund, the CDC will have more
financial resources to widen the range of vaccines provided by the government,"
he said.</P>
      <P>However, with a national vaccine fund in place, the DOH said, it will have to
evaluate the priority of vaccines suggested by a committee and prepare budgets
to make the purchases.</P>
      <P>According to Twu Shiing-jer, a legislator of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, 86.7 percent of parents pay for their children to receive
five-in-one or six-in-one vaccines instead of opting for the traditional three-
in-one vaccines provided by the government, while 34.6 percent of parents pay
for pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines for their children.</P>
      <P>Twu said this is an indication that Taiwan's inoculation policy is outdated and
results in a waste of vaccines.</P>
      <P>As to the cervical cancer vaccine, an official of the Bureau of Health Promotion
said that due to controversy over its safety and opposition by local women
rights organizations, it will not be included in the fund for the time being.</P>

fed cabbage leaves suspected to have been contaminated with a toxic substance,
the Council of Agriculture (COA) said Wednesday in a statement.</P>
      <P>The ducks died earlier Wednesday in northern Taiwan's Taoyuan County, according

      <P>A project to clear landmines on the Taiwan-controlled outlying island of Kinmen
off China's Fujian province was temporarily halted Wednesday after local
residents complained that the project had obliterated nearly 1,000 graves of
their ancestors.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen defense Command ordered that all demining operations in a 20-hectare
area in Kuningtou village be suspended, pending consultations with the island's
residents. Kuningtou was the site of a 1949 battle in which Republic of China
forces defeated two invading regiments of China's People's Liberation Army.</P>
      <P>Li Chao-chin, head of the village of Kuningtou, said most of the graves in the
area marked for demining did not have headstones, and that it would be extremely
difficult now for the residents to locate their ancestors' graves.</P>
      <P>Lee Wen-chun, head of the Chinning Township, where the village of Kuningtou is
located, said the residents are demanding that their ancestors' graves be
restored to their original conditions.</P>
      <P>Noting that many of graves could no longer be distinguished, Lee said the
military may need to build a shrine for collective ancestor worship by local
residents.</P>
      <P>Some of the residents have threatened to take legal action to settle the dispute
and seek compensation from the defense command.</P>
      <P>The shores of Kinmen -- Taiwan's farthest outpost in the military standoff with
China -- were carpeted with landmines during the peak hostilities between the
two sides in the 1950s.</P>
      <P>In the 1950s and 1960s, many civilians were killed or maimed when they
accidentally stepped on the explosive devices.</P>
      <P>As cross-strait tensions eased, the government lifted the wartime regulations in
1992 and ended Kinmen's status as a combat zone.</P>

    <HEADLINE>High court rejects KMT lawmaker's appeal against election annulment</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taichung High Court rejected Wednesday the ruling Kuomintang (KMT)
legislator Lu E-jin's appeal against a Miaoli District  Court ruling which
annulled his election  on vote-buying charges.</P>
      <P>Lu, a first-time lawmaker, was the first member of the current legislature to
lose a seat. The loss of Lu's seat is not expected to make a big impact on the
legislature, which is dominated by the KMT. The party and its allies control
nearly three-fourths of the seats.</P>
      <P>Lu, a former secretary-general of the Miaoli County Farmers' Association, was
elected in the Jan. 12 legislative election. He won the election with 64,817
votes against two-term legislator Tu Wen-ching of the Democratic Progressive
Party, who received 46,905 ballots.</P>
      <P>Soon after his election, Lu and two of his campaign staff members were indicted
on vote-buying charges.</P>
      <P>And Tu filed a civil suit seeking the invalidation of Lu's election.</P>
      <P>The court verdict said Lu made 16 visits to temples in Yuanli and Chunan -- two
of the eight townships in one of Miaoli's County's two constituencies -- between
June and October last year. During that time he made donations and solicited
support, via his campaign aides, for his election bid.</P>
      <P>The court said Lu had not been known previously to make donations to the temples
and had only done so during the election campaign. The court then ruled that his
donations would influence voters' voting behavior.</P>
      <P>The high court has the final say on the case.</P>
      <P>The current Public Officials Election and Recall Law requires that an incumbent
legislator be stripped of his or her seat on the day the high court annuls his
or her election.</P>
      <P>As Lu's remaining term in office exceeds one year, the Central Election
Commission must hold a by-election in the northern county of Miaoli within three
months from the day it receives the relevant court verdict.</P>
      <P>In a May 29 ruling, the Miaoli District Court annulled Lu's election on vote-
buying charges. Lu appealed the case to the Taichung High Court.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture on Wednesday picked Chiaotou township
in the southern county of Kaohsiung as one of Taiwan's 10 major flower field
landscapes.</P>
      <P>The township administration worked with local farmers to turn 50 hectares of
fallow farmland into stunning, colorful flower fields by growing three kinds of
flowers -- Cosmos bipinnatus, sunflower, and Ruellia brittoniana.</P>
      <P>The sea of flowers has attracted many visitors from Kaohsiung and other

blooms.</P>
      <P>Hsu Chung-ming, head of Chiaotou township, said visitors to his township will
find that in addition to the beautiful flowers, there are other attractions,

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan has yet to pass the budget for the much-anticipated
consumption coupons for all citizens, but local governments  have been rushing
to unveil lucrative incentives to lure consumers from around the country to
spend the free vouchers in their districts.</P>
      <P>The legislature last Friday passed a bill that authorizes the govenrment to
issue NT$3,600 (US$108) in consumption vouchers to each local citizen as part of
an all-out  effort to spur private consumption and bolster the slumping economy.
The Cabinet has accordingly come up with a NT$85.7 billion budget plan for the
project, which is pending legislative approval.</P>
      <P>If all goes well, the shopping vouchers will be distributed from Jan. 18 for use
until Sept.30, 2009.</P>
      <P>The Taichung city government is among the first to come up with a comprehensive
package geared toward getting the biggest possible slice of the "consumption
voucher" pie by offering a luxury house valued at NT$10 million as the top prize
in a lucky draw for those who make purchases in the central city with the soon-
to-be-issued shopping vouchers.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a Taichung City Council meeting Wednesday, Mayor Jason Hu told
councilors that the city government has worked out a number of creative tactics
to attract consumers from around Taiwan to spend their shopping vouchers in the
city.</P>
      <P>Under the initial plan, the top prize winner will also be treated to a candlelit
dinner with Hu, which will feature dishes cooked by Taichung City Council
Speaker Chang Hung-nien and city councilors waiting tables.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mayor Hsiao Jia-chi said the city government will unveil further details
about its lucky draw promotion package in early January, with an aim of
attracting NT$10 billion worth of business to Taichung through the central
government-financed shopping voucher program.</P>
      <P>According to the initial plan, those who spend a specified amount in shopping
vouchers and visit the city's designated tourist spots will be eligible to join
the lucky draw in which many prizes, including a luxury house and three
expensive cars, will be at stake.</P>
      <P>Other city and county governments, including Miaoli County, Yulin County, Taipei
County, Kaohsiung City and Pingtung County, have also announced various
promotion projects to lure consumers to spend their shopping vouchers in those
districts.</P>
      <P>The Miaoli county government in northern Taiwan said it will earmark NT$10
million to finance a lucky draw for the participation of those who spend up to
NT$5,000 in the county and the prizes up for grabs will include 10 luxury cars
and 100 high-end TV sets.</P>

      <P>A call center will be activated after the New Year holiday to offer counseling
services to local consumers and retailers on the use and reimbursement of the
shopping vouchers to be issued by the government to buttress the sluggish
economy, an official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hu Chung-ying, vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and

the call center operations which will remain open until the end of September

      <P>According to Hu, an open tender will be held to pick a qualified bidder to
operate the call center.</P>
      <P>In the initial stage, 20 telephone lines will be installed at the call center to

    <HEADLINE>Ma calls for legislative endorsement of human rights covenants</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  10  (CNA)
12/10/08  18:48:18
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou called on the Legislative Yuan Wednesday to give its
long-delayed endorsement to two international human rights documents to help
implement human rights protection in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Referring to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights that were
introduced by the United Nations in 1966 and came into force in 1976, Ma said
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will again present the covenants to the
Cabinet during a weekly Cabinet meeting Thursday, to highlight the importance
Taiwan attaches to human rights.</P>
      <P>After that, the documents will be forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for review,
Ma said.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while addressing the presentation of the 2008 Asian
Democracy and Human Rights Award, an annual event organized by the Taiwan
Foundation for Democracy to mark Dec.10 International Human Rights Day.</P>
      <P>The winner of this year's award is Sima Samar, chairwoman of the Afghan
Independent Human Rights Commission and founder of the Shuhada Organization, a
non-government group dedicated to the welfare and progress of Afghan people
residing inside and outside of Afghanistan, with a primary focus on the
empowerment of women and girls.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that although the Republic of China signed the treaties before losing
its U.N. membership in 1971, they have never been endorsed by the country's
legislature over the ensuing 40 years.</P>
      <P>During the eight-year  Democratic  Progressive  Party (DPP) administration that
ended earlier this year, the covenants were submitted by the Cabinet to the
legislative for endorsement four times, none of which were successful, Ma went
on.</P>
      <P>The president said the legislature's endorsement is essential before Taiwan can
move on to the next steps -- seeking to deposit its ratifications of the two
covenants with the United Nations and implementing them in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Realizing the difficulties involved in seeking to deposit the ratifications with
the United Nations without membership in the organization, Taiwan did not try
soliciting legislative endorsement of the covenants until the pro-independence
DPP came to power in 2000.</P>
      <P>The move, however, gave rise to fears that the covenants -- which promise the
right of self-determination for all peoples -- could boost a bid by pro-
independent activists to promote a plebiscite on the issue of independence vs.
unification with China and escalate tension across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The covenants therefore failed to win the support of the then-opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party, which together held a majority in the
legislature during the eight years in which the DPP was in power.</P>
      <P>With Ma's strong support for the ratification of the covenants, it remains to be
seen if his ruling KMT, which now controls two-thirds of the legislative seats,
will change its attitude on the issue.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the matter, MOFA spokesman Henry Chen said his ministry will step
up its communication with the legislators to facilitate early ratification of
the covenants and further Taiwan's achievements in human rights protection.</P>
      <P>Also during Wednesday's ceremony, Ma said Taiwan's improvements in its human
rights record over the past 15 years have greatly impressed world human rights
groups, with Taiwan's status having been changed from that of a "partly free"
country to a "free" country.</P>
      <P>He added that thanks to the government's continued efforts to uphold human
rights, Taiwan has now become "the world's freest country" in terms of the
people's right to assembly, which he said was very well demonstrated by several
protests at the ceremony in support of a variety of causes.</P>
      <P>The  protesters  included  several  supporters  of  Tibetan independence who
were there to express their opposition to Ma's recent rejection of a proposed
visit to Taiwan by the Dalai Lama, and an activist against the government's
recent relocation  of a sanatorium for leprosy patients.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Butterfly populations on Orchid Island changing: biologist</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Population structures of butterfly species on Orchid Island off the east coast
of Taiwan have been changing, possibly as a result of climate change, a
biologist said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Jason Yeh, director of the Taipei Zoo, told reporters that a butterfly research
team of zoo workers and students from National Taiwan University and National
Taiwan Normal University has monitored butterfly communities on Orchid Island
for two years and has found an apparent change in the population structure of
various species.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the population of Catopyrops ancyra almora -- a lycaenid butterfly
originating in the Philippines -- has established a stable foothold on Orchid
Island after the species was first discovered there in 1998.</P>
      <P>He also noted that on Nov. 23, the research team, working with two biologists
from Japan, caught a tagged blue-mottled butterfly, or Parantica sita niphonica,
that had been released from the island of Kamigoto in Nagasaki Prefecture,
southwestern Japan.</P>
      <P>It was the second time a tagged butterfly of this species released in Kamigoto
was found to have made a long-distance migration to Orchid Island, with the
first sighting reported in 2007.</P>
      <P>Parantica sita niphonica, also known as the chestnut tiger butterfly, is a
medium-sized species with a wingspan that can reach 10 centimeters. It has semi-
transparent blue spots on its wings.</P>
      <P>Large numbers of this species can be found between May and July on Yangming
Mountain and Datun Mountain in northern  Taiwan's Yangmingshan National Park.</P>
      <P>Since 2000, Taiwanese and Japanese lepidopterists have worked together to
investigate how the little, fragile creatures can travel more than 2,000
kilometers across the ocean between Taiwan and Japan.</P>
      <P>In recent years, at least four tagged butterflies released in Taiwan have been
retrieved in Japan, while six tagged in Japan have been discovered in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cross-strait detente serves Japan's interests: KMT chief</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Improving Taiwan-China relations will help to reduce tensions and create peace
in the region, serving the interests of Japan and Asia as a whole, Taiwan's
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) chairman said in Tokyo Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Based on the opinion of the majority in Taiwan, President Ma Ying-jeou has a
clear policy to maintain the status quo in the Taiwan Strait, but conditions are
not yet ripe for the two sides to talk about unification," said Wu Poh-hsiung.</P>
      <P>The KMT chairman made the remarks while explaining the KMT's policies  and the
purpose  of his current visit to Japan to international reporters at a news
conference sponsored by the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan. Taiwan's top
representative to Japan John C. T. Feng was also present.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the Ma administration will not support independence for Taiwan
because that would lead to war with China.</P>
      <P>Both the United States and Japan are in favor of cross-strait detente, and
Taiwan is committed to making peace in the region, rather than creating trouble,
he said.</P>
      <P>However, to maintain its self-defense and safeguard cross-strait peace, Taiwan
will continue to purchase weapons from the United States, he stated.</P>
      <P>President Ma attaches great importance to Taiwan's special partnership with
Japan, Wu said, adding that his own visit to Japan in his capacity as KMT
chairman is aimed at helping to step up two-way interactions with various
sectors in Japan.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the controversy over the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands, an
uninhabited island group in the East China Sea which is claimed by Taiwan, China
and Japan, Wu stressed that Taiwan and Japan should set aside sovereignty
disputes and handle the issue peacefully through mutually beneficial joint
development, particularly in the area of fishing rights.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, on the upcoming fourth forum to be held by the KMT and the Communist
Party of China in Shanghai Dec. 20-21, Wu said the two sides are expected to
discuss economic cooperation to deal with the current economic recession.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will also be willing to collaborate with Japan to tackle the financial
turmoil, he added.</P>
      <P>Turning to the Tibet issue, Wu said that in accordance with the Republic of
China Constitution, Taiwan authorities will not support the Tibet independence
movement.</P>
      <P>Wu will proceed to Yokohama Thursday where he will call on the city's mayor,
Hiroshi Nakada, and meet with representatives of the Taiwanese community there
before heading to Kobe and Osaka where he will have a similar agenda.</P>
      <P>Wu paid a call on Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara Monday at the Tokyo City Hall
and relayed President Ma's desire for better ties between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Wu arrived in Japan Sunday at the head of a 15-member delegation on his first
visit to the country in his capacity as leader of Taiwan's ruling party.</P>
      <P>He is slated to return to Taiwan Saturday.</P>
      <P>Japan, a long-term close ally of Taiwan in the region despite the lack of formal
diplomatic ties between the two countries, has been wary of the warming
relations between Taiwan and China since Ma came to power in May.</P>

      <P>The mass rapid transit (MRT) line that is being built to connect Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport and metropolitan  Taipei  is scheduled  to be completed
by 2014, transportation officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The new facility will offer travelers faster and more convenient transportation
services, cutting the distance between Taipei City and the country's main
airport to 35-minutes, from the current average 45 minutes by bus, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>Once the MRT line goes into operation, the officials noted, there will be a 25
percent drop in the number of privately owned automobiles entering the airport
and a 20 percent decline in the number of regular buses operating on the airport
route.</P>
      <P>The metro system, currently under construction, will alleviate traffic
congestion between Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and Taipei, aviation
police said.</P>
      <P>Aviation Police Office statistics show that the traffic flow toward the airport
averages 30,000 vehicles a day. Road traffic around the terminals is usually
jammed during the peak flight periods at the airport, the police said.</P>
      <P>According to the Bureau of High Speed Rail which is in charge of the MRT
project, work on the section of metro line between the airport and Sanchong in
Taipei County has been on schedule.</P>
      <P>However, completion of the underground section between Sanchong and Taipei will
be delayed until October 2014 due to the challenging underground work, the
bureau said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Southwest Taiwan's agricultural-based Yunlin county organized an "Orange Day"
activity Wednesday in an all-out effort to promote the homegrown produce amid a
glut and severe drop in prices.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, county Magistrate Su Chih-fen and the county's agricultural bureau
chief Lu Cheng-chang visited Gukeng township in eastern Yunlin, which is a major
orange production area in Taiwan, and urged the public to consume more oranges
during the current high season.</P>
      <P>They also promised to help sell the produce to overseas markets, including
China, through direct channels.</P>
      <P>From Dec. 15 - Jan. 25, Taiwanese consumers can buy fine-quality oranges from
Yunlin at 120 specially designated venues across the country, Lu said.</P>
      <P>According to Su, some 3,500 hectares of farmland in Yunlin are reserved for
cultivating oranges -- which could yield more than 80,000 metric tons of the
fruit per year.</P>
      <P>The amount of oranges produced is apparently more than the domestic market can
consume, as more growers have dedicated to cultivating the fruit in recent
years.</P>
      <P>Lu said the Yunlin county government will explore more feasible ways to sell
local oranges to the whole world, including Southeast Asia, Europe and the
United States.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, China ordered 1,200 metric tons of Taiwanese oranges at above market
prices, in keeping with a promise made by visiting Chinese negotiator Chen
Yunlin during his historic visit to Taiwan last month.</P>
      <P>Chen made the promise as a goodwill gesture and to alleviate the pressure on
orange growers after he learned of a glut of the fruit in central and southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Of the 1,200 metric tons of oranges China ordered, 1,000 metric tons will be
delivered from Yunlin County and 200 metric tons from Kaohsiung County, also in
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>China ordered the oranges at a price of NT$13 (US$0.39) per kilogram. Orange
prices in Taiwan have dipped to a record low of NT$10 per kilogram for fine
quality oranges, and NT$5 per kilogram on average for those of lower quality
produced in the southern regions of the island from November to April.</P>
      <P>Some of the local growers prefer to let their oranges become ripe and fall to
the ground, instead of harvesting them due to a lack of profit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New rules for U.K. student visas to take effect next March: BTCO</HEADLINE>

      <P>New rules for foreign students, including Taiwanese, applying to study in the
United Kingdom will take effect beginning next March in time for the 2009 summer
season, the Taipei-based British Trade and Cultural Office (BTCO) said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Under the new measures, students will be required by a sponsor school licensed
by the U.K. Border Agency to apply for a visa, Nick Jagger, head of BTCOs
British Assistance &amp; Services Section, explained in a press conference.</P>
      <P>Along with the requirement, Jagger said that all British public as well as
private schools of all levels that intend to recruit overseas students from non-
European Economic Area will also be evaluated on whether they meet the
governments criteria to be issued a license.</P>
      <P>BTCO Deputy Director Charles Garrett said that the initiative will ensure the
quality of education received by overseas students, while helping the British
government stamp out bogus schools.</P>
      <P>The list of schools qualified to receive the license will be released in the
near future, he added.</P>
      <P>Under the points-based system (PBS) introduced by the U.K. in June, there are
five tiers, or categories, for visa applications: Tier 1Vhighly skilled
individuals; Tier 2Vskilled individuals with job offer; Tier 3Vlow skilled
individuals; Tier 4 Vstudents; and Tier 5Vyouth mobility and temporary workers.</P>
      <P>Jagger said that students who attend a licensed sponsor school will be granted
up to four months of extended stay permission, during which they can apply to
switch to a Tier 1 visa if they wish to remain in the U.K. to find work after
their studies.</P>
      <P>He noted, however, that if students decide to travel back to their home country,
but later decide to go back to the U.K., they will also be eligible to apply for
a Tier 1 visa within 12 months of graduation, which, if enoughpointsare
collected on the U.K.'s points-based system assessment, will allow them to stay
two years in the European country.</P>
      <P>Jagger expressed his hopes that the plan for the student-tier of the system will
attract more students to consider studying in the U.K., and enhance their
willingness to remain in the country after graduating so they can contribute to
the British society by working there.</P>
      <P>According to the BTCO, the PBS was introduced to control immigration to the
country and streamline the visa application process.</P>
      <P>In the past, applicants would have to first apply to the Home Office in the U.K.
and then go to the BTCO to apply for a visa if they pass the Home Office review
process.</P>
      <P>Also, with the PBS, applicants are able to do an online self-assessment before
applying to enable them to calculate whether or not they are likely to meet the
number of points required to be issued a visa.</P>
      <P>Points will be awarded according to an objective criteria such as

    <HEADLINE>National Vaccine Fund passes first review in legislature</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 10 (CNA)
12/10/08  21:25:48
(By Emmanuelle Tzeng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan's Health, Environment and Labor committee completed its
first review of a draft amendment to the Law on the Control of Communicable
Diseases, which aims to establish a national vaccine fund, improve health care
in Taiwan, and boost the country's competitiveness in the fields of public
health and medicine, the Department of Health (DOH) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The amendments allow for the establishment of a national vaccine fund for the
purchase of vaccines and the implementation of national inoculation policies.</P>
      <P>The bill has to be sent to the full legislature for further discussion and
examination.</P>
      <P>If the bill is passed by the legislature, a budget to purchase vaccines will be
available from the year following the establishment of the vaccine fund.</P>
      <P>Revenue for the fund will be drawn from government budgets, the health and
welfare tax on tobacco, earnings from the public welfare lottery, and donations.
Donors, however, will not be allowed to specify which vaccines should be
purchased from the fund.</P>
      <P>Once the bill is passed, the Cabinet-level DOH will have a stable fund from
which to pay for its procurement of vaccines and ancillary items and will thus
be able to ensure a stable supply.</P>
      <P>The items that could be purchased under the fund will be discussed with a view
to avoiding conflicts of interests.</P>
      <P>DOH Minister Yeh Ching-chuan said in a Legislative Yuan committee meeting that
currently, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has a budget of only NT$400
million to buy vaccines that are offered to the public by the government.</P>
      <P>"With the establishment of a national vaccine fund, the CDC will have more
financial resources to widen the range of vaccines provided by the government,"
he said.</P>
      <P>However, with a national vaccine fund in place, the DOH said, it will have to
evaluate the priority of vaccines suggested by a committee and prepare budgets
to make the purchases.</P>
      <P>According to Twu Shiing-jer, a legislator of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, 86.7 percent of parents pay for their children to receive
five-in-one or six-in-one vaccines instead of opting for the traditional three-
in-one vaccines provided by the government, while 34.6 percent of parents pay
for pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines for their children.</P>
      <P>Twu said this is an indication that Taiwan's inoculation policy is outdated and
results in a waste of vaccines.</P>
      <P>As to the cervical cancer vaccine, an official of the Bureau of Health Promotion
said that due to controversy over its safety and opposition by local women
rights organizations, it will not be included in the fund for the time being.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is investigating the cause of death of 19 ducks after they were
fed cabbage leaves suspected to have been contaminated with a toxic substance,
the Council of Agriculture (COA) said Wednesday in a statement.</P>
      <P>The ducks died earlier Wednesday in northern Taiwan's Taoyuan County, according
to the COA.</P>
      <P>Officials from the COA's Agriculture and Food Agency have contacted Taoyuan
County authorities to determine the origin of the cabbages, the COA said.</P>
      <P>Samples of the ducks and cabbages have also been taken to a laboratory for
testing.</P>
      <P>The case, though isolated, should be resolved as soon as possible in order not
to affect consumers' confidence, the agency said.</P>
      <P>In an effort to help protect consumers' health, the agency often conducts random
tests on the chemical residue levels in vegetables growing in the fields and
sold in wholesale markets. From the beginning of the year to the end of
November, it had conducted 3,761 tests, with 97.28 percent of them passing.</P>
      <P>The agency will ask farmers whose vegetables failed the test to delay their
harvest and provide them with safe pesticides, officials said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A project to clear landmines on the Taiwan-controlled outlying island of Kinmen
off China's Fujian province was temporarily halted Wednesday after local
residents complained that the project had obliterated nearly 1,000 graves of
their ancestors.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen defense Command ordered that all demining operations in a 20-hectare
area in Kuningtou village be suspended, pending consultations with the island's
residents. Kuningtou was the site of a 1949 battle in which Republic of China
forces defeated two invading regiments of China's People's Liberation Army.</P>
      <P>Li Chao-chin, head of the village of Kuningtou, said most of the graves in the
area marked for demining did not have headstones, and that it would be extremely
difficult now for the residents to locate their ancestors' graves.</P>
      <P>Lee Wen-chun, head of the Chinning Township, where the village of Kuningtou is
located, said the residents are demanding that their ancestors' graves be
restored to their original conditions.</P>
      <P>Noting that many of graves could no longer be distinguished, Lee said the
military may need to build a shrine for collective ancestor worship by local
residents.</P>
      <P>Some of the residents have threatened to take legal action to settle the dispute
and seek compensation from the defense command.</P>
      <P>The shores of Kinmen -- Taiwan's farthest outpost in the military standoff with
China -- were carpeted with landmines during the peak hostilities between the
two sides in the 1950s.</P>
      <P>In the 1950s and 1960s, many civilians were killed or maimed when they
accidentally stepped on the explosive devices.</P>
      <P>As cross-strait tensions eased, the government lifted the wartime regulations in
1992 and ended Kinmen's status as a combat zone.</P>
      <P>The move allowed the island to open up to tourism, prompting the need to clear
the landmines from areas of Kinmen no longer under military control.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taichung High Court rejected Wednesday the ruling Kuomintang (KMT)
legislator Lu E-jin's appeal against a Miaoli District  Court ruling which
annulled his election  on vote-buying charges.</P>
      <P>Lu, a first-time lawmaker, was the first member of the current legislature to
lose a seat. The loss of Lu's seat is not expected to make a big impact on the
legislature, which is dominated by the KMT. The party and its allies control
nearly three-fourths of the seats.</P>
      <P>Lu, a former secretary-general of the Miaoli County Farmers' Association, was
elected in the Jan. 12 legislative election. He won the election with 64,817
votes against two-term legislator Tu Wen-ching of the Democratic Progressive
Party, who received 46,905 ballots.</P>
      <P>Soon after his election, Lu and two of his campaign staff members were indicted
on vote-buying charges.</P>
      <P>And Tu filed a civil suit seeking the invalidation of Lu's election.</P>
      <P>The court verdict said Lu made 16 visits to temples in Yuanli and Chunan -- two
of the eight townships in one of Miaoli's County's two constituencies -- between
June and October last year. During that time he made donations and solicited
support, via his campaign aides, for his election bid.</P>
      <P>The court said Lu had not been known previously to make donations to the temples
and had only done so during the election campaign. The court then ruled that his
donations would influence voters' voting behavior.</P>
      <P>The high court has the final say on the case.</P>
      <P>The current Public Officials Election and Recall Law requires that an incumbent
legislator be stripped of his or her seat on the day the high court annuls his
or her election.</P>
      <P>As Lu's remaining term in office exceeds one year, the Central Election
Commission must hold a by-election in the northern county of Miaoli within three
months from the day it receives the relevant court verdict.</P>
      <P>In a May 29 ruling, the Miaoli District Court annulled Lu's election on vote-
buying charges. Lu appealed the case to the Taichung High Court.</P>

      <P>The Legislative Yuan has yet to pass the budget for the much-anticipated
consumption coupons for all citizens, but local governments  have been rushing
to unveil lucrative incentives to lure consumers from around the country to
spend the free vouchers in their districts.</P>
      <P>The legislature last Friday passed a bill that authorizes the govenrment to
issue NT$3,600 (US$108) in consumption vouchers to each local citizen as part of
an all-out  effort to spur private consumption and bolster the slumping economy.
The Cabinet has accordingly come up with a NT$85.7 billion budget plan for the
project, which is pending legislative approval.</P>
      <P>If all goes well, the shopping vouchers will be distributed from Jan. 18 for use
until Sept.30, 2009.</P>
      <P>The Taichung city government is among the first to come up with a comprehensive
package geared toward getting the biggest possible slice of the "consumption
voucher" pie by offering a luxury house valued at NT$10 million as the top prize
in a lucky draw for those who make purchases in the central city with the soon-
to-be-issued shopping vouchers.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a Taichung City Council meeting Wednesday, Mayor Jason Hu told
councilors that the city government has worked out a number of creative tactics
to attract consumers from around Taiwan to spend their shopping vouchers in the
city.</P>
      <P>Under the initial plan, the top prize winner will also be treated to a candlelit
dinner with Hu, which will feature dishes cooked by Taichung City Council
Speaker Chang Hung-nien and city councilors waiting tables.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mayor Hsiao Jia-chi said the city government will unveil further details
about its lucky draw promotion package in early January, with an aim of
attracting NT$10 billion worth of business to Taichung through the central
government-financed shopping voucher program.</P>
      <P>According to the initial plan, those who spend a specified amount in shopping
vouchers and visit the city's designated tourist spots will be eligible to join
the lucky draw in which many prizes, including a luxury house and three
expensive cars, will be at stake.</P>
      <P>Other city and county governments, including Miaoli County, Yulin County, Taipei
County, Kaohsiung City and Pingtung County, have also announced various
promotion projects to lure consumers to spend their shopping vouchers in those
districts.</P>
      <P>The Miaoli county government in northern Taiwan said it will earmark NT$10
million to finance a lucky draw for the participation of those who spend up to
NT$5,000 in the county and the prizes up for grabs will include 10 luxury cars

Speaker Chang Hung-nien and city councilors waiting tables.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mayor Hsiao Jia-chi said the city government will unveil further details
about its lucky draw promotion package in early January, with an aim of
attracting NT$10 billion worth of business to Taichung through the central
government-financed shopping voucher program.</P>
      <P>According to the initial plan, those who spend a specified amount in shopping
vouchers and visit the city's designated tourist spots will be eligible to join
the lucky draw in which many prizes, including a luxury house and three
expensive cars, will be at stake.</P>
      <P>Other city and county governments, including Miaoli County, Yulin County, Taipei
County, Kaohsiung City and Pingtung County, have also announced various
promotion projects to lure consumers to spend their shopping vouchers in those
districts.</P>
      <P>The Miaoli county government in northern Taiwan said it will earmark NT$10
million to finance a lucky draw for the participation of those who spend up to
NT$5,000 in the county and the prizes up for grabs will include 10 luxury cars

      <P>A call center will be activated after the New Year holiday to offer counseling
services to local consumers and retailers on the use and reimbursement of the
shopping vouchers to be issued by the government to buttress the sluggish
economy, an official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hu Chung-ying, vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) , said the government has budgeted NT$12 million to finance
the call center operations which will remain open until the end of September
when the shopping vouchers will expire.</P>
      <P>According to Hu, an open tender will be held to pick a qualified bidder to
operate the call center.</P>
      <P>In the initial stage, 20 telephone lines will be installed at the call center to
provide counseling on the distribution, use and reimbursement of shopping
vouchers, Hu said, adding that the CEPD will unveil detailed regulations for
shopping voucher distribution, use and reimbursement next week after further
discussion with the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Finance and other
agencies.</P>
      <P>The legislature last Friday passed a bill that authorizes the govenrment to
issue NT$3,600 (US$108) in consumption vouchers to each local citizen as part of
an all-out  effort to spur private consumption and bolster the slumping economy.
The Cabinet has accordingly come up with a NT$85.7 billion budget plan for the
project, which is pending legislative approval.</P>
      <P>If all goes well, the shopping vouchers will be distributed from Jan. 18 for use

    <HEADLINE>Majority of air traffic controllers have communication problems: poll</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly two thirds of air traffic controllers in Taiwan have difficulty
communicating with foreign pilots, mainly due to the pilots' English accents, a
survey released by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC)
showed Thursday.</P>
      <P>The MOTC conducted the survey between April and July on 2,003 pilots of six
Taiwan air carriers -- China Airlines, EVA Airways, Mandarin Airlines, Trans
Asia Airways, UNI Airways Corp. and Daily Air Corp. -- and 261 air traffic
controllers of the Civil Aeronautics Administration. Responses were obtained
from 38.2 percent of the pilots and 93.5 percent of the air traffic controllers.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 74.6 percent of the air traffic controllers said they
have difficulty communicating with foreign pilots.</P>
      <P>The main reasons for the problems were found to be the level of English
proficiency of the air traffic controllers and the English accents of foreign
pilots from non-English speaking countries.</P>
      <P>Also, 23.4 percent of the air traffic controllers said they do not understand
how an aircraft functions, which led the MOTC to suggest that more training is
needed to enhance flight safety and air control efficiency.</P>
      <P>Contrary to the perception that pilots and air traffic controllers earn high
pay, 60 percent of the pilots polled said they were "not satisfied" with their
salaries, while 82.5 percent of the air traffic controllers said their pay was
unsatisfying.</P>
      <P>Also, 77.2 percent of the air traffic controllers were of the view that their
shifts are understaffed and that overtime work endangers flight safety. They
suggested that the Civil Aeronautics Administration pay attention to the problem
of inadequate air traffic controller staff.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cabinet to communicate with legislature on human rights covenants</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  11 (CNA)
12/11/08  15:56:47

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan instructed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Thursday to
actively seek negotiations with legislators to win their long-delayed
endorsement of two international human rights covenants.</P>
      <P>Liu issued the directive at a weekly Cabinet meeting, during which the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs delivered a report on the progress in promoting ratification
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the
International  Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.</P>
      <P>Liu's directive came one day after President Ma Ying-jeou openly called for an
early ratification of the covenants to highlight the importance Taiwan attaches
to human rights protection.</P>
      <P>The covenants were introduced by the United Nations in 1966 and came into force
in 1976. The Republic of China became a signatory to the covenants in 1967, when
it was still a member of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>At a news conference held after the Cabinet meeting, Minister of Foreign Affairs
Francisco H.L. Ou noted that the government did not proceed immediately with the
ratification of the covenants in the 1960s because at that time, the human
rights situation in Taiwan was not in compliance with the requirements set forth
in the documents.</P>
      <P>The procedure was suspended after the country lost its U.N. membership in 1971,
Ou said.</P>
      <P>During  the  former  Democratic  Progressive  Party  (DPP) administration,  the
Cabinet  submitted  the covenants  to the legislature for endorsement, first in
2001 and again in 2002 and 2005, but because of differences among legislators,
there was no decision on the issue, he said.</P>
      <P>The treaties were last presented to the Legislative Yuan in February 2008, but
were again excluded from the legislative agenda, Ou said.</P>
      <P>A major bone of contention was a clause in the covenants promising self-
determination of all peoples, which some feared could fuel a bid by pro-
independence activists to promote a plebiscite on the issue of independence
versus unification with China and thereby escalate tensions across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>The covenants therefore failed to win the support of the then-opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party, which together held a majority in the
legislature during the eight years the pro-independence DPP was in power.</P>
      <P>With Ma's strong support for the ratification of the covenants, it remains to be
seen whether his ruling KMT, which now controls two-thirds of the legislative
seats, will change its stance on the issue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Sun Moon Lake being spoiled by incongruous buildings: visitors</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/11/08  16:35:17</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Sun Moon Lake, one of Taiwan's most popular scenic spots, is often described as
a wonderland veiled in mountain mist. But some tourists have been complaining
about series of big hotels on the edge of the lake which detract from the
aesthetics of the setting.</P>
      <P>Sun Moon Lake, located in central Taiwan in Nantou County's Yuchih Township and
the island's largest lake, is surrounded by mountains that rise 760 meters above
sea level.</P>
      <P>The eastern part of the lake is round like the sun and the western part is
shaped like a crescent moon, hence its name Sun Moon Lake.</P>
      <P>According to Hung Wei-hsin, deputy director of the Sun Moon Lake Scenic Area
Administration, in 2007, a total of 3 million foreign and domestic tourists
visited the area and this year the number is very likely to increase.</P>
      <P>But some of these visitors have expressed regret that the natural scenery is
being spoilt by unsightly artificial structures on the edge of the lake.</P>
      <P>Rui Ming-tai, a tourist from Taichung City in central Taiwan, told the Central
News Agency that public facilities and the quality of service at the Sun Moon
Lake Scenic Area have improved, but that the views seem to be less stimulating
than when he visited the area two years ago.</P>
      <P>"The quality of the roads is better, and hotels are more and more comfortable,
but we are seeing many giant hotels, including some under construction, and
their facades are far from being in harmony with nature," he said.</P>
      <P>He suggested  that the administration  do something  about coordinating  the
height and outward appearance  of the hotel buildings.</P>
      <P>Rui said he would have liked to be able to see the lake from his hotel room, but
another hotel under construction on the edge of the lake was blocking the view.</P>
      <P>Another tourist, who declined to give her name, said that the design of some
buildings being constructed near the lake is "odd." She pointed to the example
of a station for a cable car service that will connect Sun Moon Lake with the
Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village, also a tourist spot in Nantou County.</P>
      <P>Having traveled in many countries, she said, she does not understand why the
Taiwan government cannot harmonize the buildings' design and require hotel
developers to use natural construction materials such as wood so that the
buildings would blend with the surroundings.</P>
      <P>According to the Urban Planning section of the Nantou County Government,
construction plans for hotels are subject to regulations on size and height,
which specify that the building should be no taller than six or seven floors.</P>
      <P>However, some some of the hotels in the area do not adhere to these
specifications and there are no regulations regarding the facades of hotels and
the materials used to construct them.</P>
      <P>"The county government and the scenic area administration can only make
suggestions (on hotels' appearance and building materials) to the owners," said
Hung.</P>
      <P>Moreover, hotel operators have their own business considerations and usually
want to have as many rooms as possible to maximize their profits, he added.</P>
      <P>With the construction of several new hotels in progress, it is not known if and
when the aesthetics of the area will improve.</P>
      <P>According to a tour guide with a yacht company at the lake, the number of rooms
and hotels at the Sun Moon Lake area remain inadequate, especially during the
peak seasons.</P>
      <P>Even on an ordinary day, there would be enough passengers for her yacht to make
several round tours of the lake before 7: 30 a.m., she said.</P>
      <P>She expressed the view that although the number of Chinese tourists to the area
has been lower than anticipated since Taiwan increased the allowable daily
number to the country, business from that source will pick up.</P>
      <P>Currently, there are three big hotels under construction in the Sun Moon Lake
scenic area.</P>
      <P>When the three hotels become operational next year, the number of rooms in the
lake area will rise from the current 2,500 to around 3,000, which should be
sufficient to meet the demand by that time, Hung said.</P>
      <P>"That number should be sufficient, " he said. "After all, the Sun Moon Lake
hinterland is very limited (in terms of space for construction)," he added.</P>

      <P>After having served as a volunteer swimming coach for 23 years, 70-year-old Chao
Yueh-nu has now expanded her work to other social service areas, saying that
"one is never too old, nor it ever too late to be a volunteer."</P>
      <P>Chao, an expert swimmer who excels at the butterfly stroke, came under the
spotlight Thursday at a press conference sponsored by the Taipei county
government to mark 2008 International Volunteer Day.</P>
      <P>Chao has frequently accompanied amateur swimmers taking part in the Swim Across
the Sun Moon Lake activity, an annual ritual that is quite physically demanding.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the news conference, Chao said that of all the people she has
coached, her most rewarding experience was teaching an 11-year-old visually-
impaired girl who at first screamed whenever she was in the water but later came
to enjoy diving.</P>
      <P>During the summer, Chao said, she spent much time at the Zhitan Dam in Xindian
on the outskirts of Taipei City serving as a lifeguard.</P>
      <P>"I have saved numerous lives," she said.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu Ming-yu, chief of the Voluntary Service Center of the Taipei
county government, Chao has expanded her volunteer work to other social service
areas in recent years.</P>
      <P>Chao has visited a nursing home in Taipei County's Bali township to feed ailing
seniors and has also worked as a telephone counselor to talk to senior citizens
who live alone and to find out about their needs and problems, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>At the news conference, the Taipei county government displayed some of the
results of the Voluntary Service Center's work over the past year in the
educational, cultural, social and medical areas.</P>
      <P>With the number of volunteers continuing to increase, the Voluntary Service
Center expects to tap 100,000 recruits in the next year to further expand
volunteer services in Taiwan's most populous county, Hsu said.</P>

      <P>The southern harbor city of Kaohsiung will launch a self-service bicycle rental
system at 20 transit points around the city by the end of December, in an
initiative to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a senior city government
official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Yu-cheng, director of the city's Environmental Protection Bureau, said
that the service will have at least 1,500 bikes before the end of January, and
the scale will be expanded to 50 rental sites and 4, 500 bikes in six months
time.</P>
      <P>All the rental spots, he added, will be located near metro stations or scenic
areas to allow easy access and to optimize efficiency.</P>
      <P>According to the city government, the service will be accessible to members as
well as non-members. Members will be required to pay a lump-sum fee in advance
and use their membership cards to rent bikes from the self-service rack, while
non-members will be able to use their credit cards to pay on the spot.</P>
      <P>The bureau said that the eco-friendly NT$90 million (US$2.7 million) bike rental
service will help reduce the city's total greenhouse gas emissions and induce

      <P>A German runner recently forwarded to Taiwan the donations collected in a
charity event in Germany, in the hope of providing assistance to a Taiwanese
female runner whose legs had to be amputated due to a severe bacterial infection
she contracted after a race in France, according to the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) Thursday.</P>
      <P>The charity run, voluntarily organized by German runner Siegfried Bullig in the
city of Dusseldorf in late October, drew over 40 participants from various
European countries who donated more than 6,200 euros (approximately NT$268,476),
according to Bullig's Web site for the event.</P>
      <P>The MOFA said it received the donation Tuesday and passed it on to Chiu Shu-
jung, an ultra-marathon runner who broke the Asian record and placed second in
the Spartathlon race held in Greece in March. Chiu lost both her legs after she
completed the 18-day Trans Gaule run along a 1,150-kilometer route in France.</P>
      <P>Bullig said on his Web site that although he knew the donation would "not be
sufficient to render noticeable financial help" to Chiu and her family, he hoped
the event would serve as an example and stimulate people to think of what they
can do for others.</P>
      <P>He also expressed the hope that Chiu, a friend of his, would be encouraged to
see how many people around the world showed compassion toward her.</P>
      <P>Chiu returned to Taiwan in late September after the double amputation surgery in
France, and is now in the process of recovery.</P>

      <P>A container ship owned and operated by Taiwan's Evergreen Marine Corp. is ready
to depart for China's northern port city of Tianjin Dec. 15 when direct cross-
Taiwan Strait shipping links will be launched, a corporate source said Thursday.</P>
      <P>When Evergreen's full-container vessel Uni-Adroit departs from Kaohsiung Harbor
at 10 a.m. Dec. 15, it will be the first Taiwanese commercial ship to sail
directly from Kaohsiung to a port in mainland China after a hiatus of more than
five decades.</P>
      <P>Uni-Adroit, with a capacity of 1,168 TEUs, is scheduled to sail directly from
Kaohsiung to Tianjin's New Port before heading to the northern Chinese ports
Dalian and Qingdao on its way home, according to an Evergreen spokesman.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, four container ships owned and operated by Taiwan's Wan Hai Lines,
Yang Ming Marine Transport Corp., Taiwan Navigation Co. and China's Huarong
Marine Co., respectively, are also scheduled to depart Dec. 15, from the
northern port of Keelung.</P>
      <P>Among the four vessels, the YM Heights, which has a capacity of 1,500 TEUs, is
scheduled to depart from Keelung for Kaohsiung Harbor before heading to
Shanghai. From Shanghai, it will visit other Chinese ports -- Dalian, Taicang,
Qingdao and Lianyungang -- before returning to Keelung, according to an official
from Yang Ming Marine.</P>
      <P>Also on Dec. 15, a 20,000-ton bulk carrier owned and operated by Da Sheng Marine
Co. is scheduled to depart from Taichung Harbor on central Taiwan's western
coast for China's southeastern port of Fuzhou, from where it will transport
gravel back to Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>International report warns against Taiwan's coral reef deterioration</HEADLINE>

12/11/08  19:00:15

    <TEXT>
      <P>A report released this week on the status of coral reefs around the world warned
that Taiwan's coral reefs, especially those located in its south and south-east
seas, were under severe stress or had been heavily damaged, and that a trend of
declining coral cover deserves attention.</P>
      <P>The report "Status of Coral Reefs of the World: 2008" found that coral cover at
24 of the 49 sites surveyed in Taiwan was lower than 30 percent.</P>
      <P>The lowest coral cover sites were even less than 10 percent, the report said.</P>
      <P>"Overall, monitoring is showing a general trend of declining coral cover on
Taiwanese coral reefs, " indicated the report released by the Global Coral Reef
Monitoring Network on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>While damage to coral reef elsewhere in the world were largely caused by the
1998 widespread coral bleaching phenomenon, which occurred due to the strong El
Nino effect that caused a rise in sea temperature, the main reasons for coral
reef deterioration in Taiwan are inappropriate fishing methods and excessive
development, experts said.</P>
      <P>"For coral reefs in Taiwan, the most serious impact would be excessive fishing
and silt sediment, " said Dai Chang-feng, professor of the Institute of
Oceanography of the National Taiwan University.</P>
      <P>He said that some fishing methods, such as using explosives, cause considerable
damage to coral reefs.</P>
      <P>According to the report, coastal areas of Taiwan have also been under  extensive
infrastructure  development  with the growing populations including aquaculture,
agriculture and resort building. As a consequence,  serious soil erosion have
led to frequent landslides in rain and typhoon seasons and massive sediment
flows into reef areas.</P>
      <P>Rising sea surface temperature represents only part of the problem for coral
reefs in Taiwan, Dai said.</P>
      <P>The report also indicated that macro-algal cover has increased in about half of
the surveyed sites in Taiwan, accompanied by higher sedimentation  loads and
increased water turbidity,  suggesting continuous reef degradation and a
possible phase shift from coral- dominated to algal-dominated reef communities.</P>
      <P>Dai said that the increase of macro-algal cover is a consequence of sewage from
coastal towns and villages discharged over reefs without proper treatment,
resulting in algal proliferation and coral loss.</P>
      <P>The macro-algal cover problem is more serious in the northern part of Taiwan
than in the south, Dai said.</P>
      <P>To improve the current situation of coral reefs, the report suggested increasing
the focus on socioeconomic monitoring as well as ecological monitoring to
provide reliable data and information for better coastal management.</P>
      <P>The report also suggested developing mechanisms for extending the network of
monitoring scientists to start a dialogue with decision makers to recommend
appropriate coral conservation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the report  noted that flourishing  coral reef communities were
observed at several sites of Lutao, Lanyu and Dongsha Atoll in Taiwan 's
southern seas. The Dongsha Atoll shows the most scenic underwater images, with
coral cover ranging from 78 percent to 85 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan eases restrictions against spouses from mainland China</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 11 (CNA)
12/11/08  19:42:14
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet on Thursday took steps to lift restrictions against mainland Chinese
spouses married to Taiwanese residents, allowing them to work soon after
arriving and shortening the time it takes them to qualify for ID card --
basically treating them more like other foreign spouses.</P>
      <P>Under a draft amendment to a law passed by the Executive Yuan, the spouses -
mostly wives - can work as long as they enter Taiwan legally, instead of having
to meet a host of requirements as they do now, including having lived here for
at least two years, having kids or having low income.</P>
      <P>The draft amendment will still have to be approved by the Legislative Yuan. If
approved, it will also shorten the amount of time that it takes for the Chinese
immigrants to qualify for a Taiwanese ID card, from eight years to six years.</P>
      <P>That is still two years more than it usually takes a spouse from any other
country, such as Vietnam, to obtain an ID card.</P>
      <P>The move comes as Taiwan and China have begun building warmer ties since
President Ma Ying-jeou came into office in May.</P>
      <P>Previous administrations have argued that the rules were imposed to prevent fake
marriages and marriages based on weak foundations, often arranged by marriage
agencies. They also admitted there were concerns about an influx of mainlanders
to Taiwan, despite the fact that single Taiwanese men tend to marry them more
than women from other countries.</P>
      <P>But the Chinese spouses and non-governmental groups representing them have long
called such policies discriminatory. Fake marriages also exist among spouses
from other countries and the divorce rate of mainland spouses are about the same
as that of local Taiwanese couples.</P>
      <P>There are an estimated 290,000 mainland Chinese spouses here - making them the
largest group of non-native spouses in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A current restriction limiting the amount of money the mainland spouses can
inherit from their Taiwanese spouse to NT$2 million will also be lifted,
according to the draft amendment to the Statute Governing the Relations between
the People of Taiwan Area and the People of Mainland Area.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said the dramatic changes are meant to "protect the
legal Chinese spouses and crack down on the illegal ones in a bid to provide
better protection to the working, ID card and property rights of legal Chinese
spouses."</P>
      <P>Liu noted that the Chinese spouses are a part of Taiwan's society, and that the
government has to address their rights so that they feel accepted here.</P>
      <P>However, mindful that some parts of the population remain wary of mainlanders,
fearing they will take local people's jobs or believing they are gold diggers,
Liu said: "The government will not allow Chinese people who come to Taiwan in
convenience marriages to work here."</P>
      <P>He demanded the Ministry of the Interior and other related agencies strengthen
the interview mechanism which assesses whether the marriages are real upon the
Chinese spouses' arrival and the visiting mechanism at their homes after they
begin living in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lai Shin-yuan, chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), said the
amendment signifies a major reform regarding the rights of Chinese spouses in
Taiwan and a realization of the protection of human rights.</P>
      <P>With the amended law shortening the years required for Chinese spouses to get
IDs to six years, Lai said around 31,000 Chinese spouses who have now stayed in
Taiwan for more than six years will get IDs immediately.</P>
      <P>The government also plans to scrap a regulation that has made it impossible for
the spouses to sponsor their children from a previous marriage to join them in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under the regulation, Chinese spouses have to be in Taiwan for at least eight
years before they can register their household here and another five years after
that before they can apply to have their biological children under 12 years of
age to come to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But Lai noted that after waiting eight years and then another five years, the
children would be 13 and would no longer qualify to come here under the rule.</P>
      <P>She criticized the regulation as being "unreasonable and not in line with human
rights," adding that the Ministry of the Interior will scrap it.</P>

      <P>How long should a promise remain binding?</P>
      <P>For Liao Ming-yi, a resident of Jhonghe City, Taipei County, it will be as long
as his coffee trees stay alive.</P>
      <P>Keeping a casual promise made by his great grandfather to a foreign tea trader,
Liao continues to take care of about 100 coffee trees that were previously  in
the care of his late father, grandfather and great grandfather.</P>
      <P>The trees, planted on a hillside at the end of Sinnan Road, Jhonghe City by a
British tea trader more than a hundred years ago, are still thriving.</P>
      <P>Coffee trees in general are rare in Taiwan, not to mention ones that are more
than 100 years old.</P>
      <P>According to records kept by local agricultural authorities, a British tea
trader brought about 100 Arabica coffee trees to Taiwan from Southeast Asia in
1884. The trees were planted in what is now the Haishan area, Taipei County.</P>
      <P>The following year, British traders sowed coffee seeds in Wenshan and Xizhi in
Taipei County, according to the records.</P>
      <P>However, these British traders' dream of establishing coffee plantations in
Taiwan never panned out and the few coffee trees they planted on an experimental
basis were left unattended after they withdrew from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liao's great grandfather was a tea farmer who lived in Jhonghe at the time. Liao
quoted his late great grandmother, born 108 years ago, as saying that when a
foreign tea trader was about to leave Taiwan, he asked her husband to take care
of the coffee trees.</P>
      <P>From that time on, Liao's family has cared for the trees, starting with his
great grandfather and on down the line to his grandfather, father, and now Liao
himself, although there is no record of the foreign tea trader ever returning to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The old coffee trees are still thriving and bearing fruit, and from their seeds,
one of Liao's uncles started a small coffee garden on a patch of his own
hillside land.</P>
      <P>"By taking care of these trees, we are not only keeping an ancestor's promise
but also keeping alive our memories of our ancestors and their sense of
solidarity." Liao said.</P>

      <P>Vietnamese officials in Taipei visited a local foundation Thursday to express
their appreciation for its long-term  financial  and medical  assistance  to
disadvantaged Vietnamese children.</P>
      <P>During a visit to the Taipei-based Compassion International Taiwan (CITW) , Ngu
Yen Cong Manh, deputy director of the Vietnam Economic and Cultural Office in
Taipei, voiced his gratitude for the foundation's efforts over the past 13 years
to help nearly 3,000 poor or sick children in central Vietnam.</P>
      <P>With CITW's support, he said during a speech on cross-cultural cooperation,
children who used to wander the streets can now go to school and receive a
formal education. In addition, a medical scheme that the CITW has been promoting
has benefited children who suffer deformities as a result of residue from
chemicals used during the Vietnam War, the official added.</P>
      <P>CITW CEO Jay Hung noted that as the high inflation rate in Vietnam has deterred
some poor families in the Southeast Asian country from sending their children to
school, his organization will increase its school funding to alleviate the
burden on these families.</P>
      <P>The foundation will also conduct a survey to ascertain which families are in

      <P>The head of Taiwan's top research institution on Thursday welcomed the
possibility that U.S. President-elect Barack Obama will name Nobel physicist
Steven Chu as his secretary of energy.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Chi-Huey Wong said Chu, a co-winner of the 1997 Nobel
Prize in Physics, has maintained close and cordial relations with the Academia
Sinica - Taiwan's top research institute.</P>
      <P>"If Chu is named by Obama as the new U.S. energy secretary, it will be conducive
to closer cooperation in the field of sciences between Taiwan and the United
States," Wong said.</P>
      <P>U.S. media this week reported that Chu is one of the candidates being considered
by Obama for the post.</P>
      <P>If Chu is named the U.S. energy secretary, he will be the second Cabinet-level
minister of Chinese descent in U.S. history, after Secretary of Labor Elaine L.
Chao. The 55-year-old Taiwan-born Chao is currently the highest-ranking American
official of Chinese descent in the United States.</P>
      <P>Chu was born in the United States. His parents were both from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chu, known for his research in laser cooling and the trapping of atoms, which
won him the Nobel Prize in Physics, has just returned to the United States from
Taiwan, where he attended an Academia Sinica-sponsored forum of heads of
prominent science institutes from around the world from Dec. 6-7.</P>
      <P>During that forum, Chu delivered a keynote speech, titled: "The World's Energy

      <P>The Tainan county government plans to turn a disused salt field into a wetland
area that will benefit the county's ecology conservation, a local official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The county government will spend five years transforming the 16-hectare disused
salt field in Chiku township into a wetland ecology park, according to Yang Ya-
chu, an official of the county's Department of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>Yang, who is a member of the department's forest biodiversity and conservation
section, pointed out that growing trees is a lot more difficult on salt land
than on ordinary farmland, and he admitted that Taiwan has had no success in
turning salt fields into productive land.</P>
      <P>In order to achieve a better chance of success, the local government has
commissioned scholars and experts from National Chiayi University, National
Pingtung University of Science and Technology, and the Taiwan Forestry Research
Institute to evaluate and design the tree-planting project, and signed a
contract Wednesday with the company that will carry out the project.</P>
      <P>The company will first clear up a one-meter layer of clay under the salt field
before connecting drainage pipes to ditches leading to the sea to help remove
the salt from the land.</P>
      <P>A flood pool will then be dug at the center to collect rainwater, and littoral
plants such as mangroves will be planted around the pool to function as a
windbreak, Yang said.</P>
      <P>Yang said the county government hopes to see the project pay off within five
years, although he said a subsidy of NT$40 million (US$1.2 million) from the
central government is barely enough even for the project's initial phase, which
will last until the end of next rear.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chang Gung University has developed a new set of augmented reality technologies
for brain surgery that can shorten the time needed for surgery and reduce the
risks involved, neurologists reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>The technologies, invented by researchers at the Chang Gung University and Chang
Gung Memorial Hospital in Taoyuan, combine holographic display, augmented-
reality surgery, an automated skull- opening drill, and customized tools for
skull repair implants.</P>
      <P>Unlike virtual reality (VR) , which uses computer-generated graphics to recreate
items on a screen, augmented reality (AR) creates images by modifying  real-time
images of objects with additional computer-generated graphics.</P>
      <P>Explaining the function of the technology, Lee Shih- tseng, director of the
Medical Augmented Reality Research and Development Center operated by the
university and hospital, said holographic displays can analyze medical data to
produce a "remodeled" skull on screen, which allows 360-degree inspection and
free removal of all bone and tissue.</P>
      <P>Lee said that with the holographic display, brain surgeons can get a better idea
of their patients' conditions and can determine the best path and means of
surgery.</P>
      <P>The complimentary technology of AR surgery, said Lee, allows the surgeon to
operate on the model skull using a scalpel-like device that provides feedback
and emulates the characteristics of blood vessel, tumor or bone.</P>
      <P>"With the AR surgery, surgeons can practice the process in advance to reduce
risk and avoid mistakes in the real operation, " Lee said.</P>
      <P>In real surgery, Lee continued, the automated skull-opening drill will help
control collateral damage by precisely measuring the depth of the drill, while
the implant customization tool can precisely measure one or more bone plates

      <P>Taiwan's central bank announced Thursday that it will further lower its
benchmark interest rates by 0.75 percentage points from Friday as inflationary
pressure has eased while the risks of a further downturn to the domestic economy
are rising amid the global financial turmoil.</P>
      <P>It will be the second-largest interest rate cut in the country's history and the
fifth time the central bank has adjusted downward its key lending rates since
September, when the global economy went into a recession because of fallout from
the U.S. subprime crisis.</P>
      <P>After the latest adjustments, the central bank's key lending rates will return
to the levels recorded in July 2005, with the discount rate --  the interest
rate the central bank charges depository institutions that borrow reserves from
it -- falling to 2 percent, the rate on accommodations with collateral to 2.375
percent and the rate on accommodations without collateral to 4.25 percent.</P>
      <P>Perng Fai-nan, governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of China (CBC) ,
told a news conference held after a meeting of the bank's board of directors and
supervisors that the interest rate cut is expected to help spur domestic demand
and buttress economic growth.</P>
      <P>Quoting a forecast by the Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics, Perng said the consumer price index will grow a mere
0.37 percent next year, which will help ease inflationary pressure and stabilize
domestic commodity prices.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he went on, the job market might face even gloomier prospects and
the unemployment rate will probably climb further as the country's exports --
the growth engine of the local economy -- have continued to shrink for three

      <P>Perng urged local banks not to withhold lending to normally operating business
corporations at this trying time in order to keep the local economy afloat.</P>
      <P>He also told local companies to make good use of the current low interest rates

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan eases restrictions against spouses from mainland China</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 11 (CNA)
12/11/08  19:42:14
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet on Thursday took steps to lift restrictions against mainland Chinese
spouses married to Taiwanese residents, allowing them to work soon after
arriving and shortening the time it takes them to qualify for ID card --
basically treating them more like other foreign spouses.</P>
      <P>Under a draft amendment to a law passed by the Executive Yuan, the spouses -
mostly wives - can work as long as they enter Taiwan legally, instead of having
to meet a host of requirements as they do now, including having lived here for
at least two years, having kids or having low income.</P>
      <P>The draft amendment will still have to be approved by the Legislative Yuan. If
approved, it will also shorten the amount of time that it takes for the Chinese
immigrants to qualify for a Taiwanese ID card, from eight years to six years.</P>
      <P>That is still two years more than it usually takes a spouse from any other
country, such as Vietnam, to obtain an ID card.</P>
      <P>The move comes as Taiwan and China have begun building warmer ties since
President Ma Ying-jeou came into office in May.</P>
      <P>Previous administrations have argued that the rules were imposed to prevent fake
marriages and marriages based on weak foundations, often arranged by marriage
agencies. They also admitted there were concerns about an influx of mainlanders
to Taiwan, despite the fact that single Taiwanese men tend to marry them more
than women from other countries.</P>
      <P>But the Chinese spouses and non-governmental groups representing them have long
called such policies discriminatory. Fake marriages also exist among spouses
from other countries and the divorce rate of mainland spouses are about the same
as that of local Taiwanese couples.</P>
      <P>There are an estimated 290,000 mainland Chinese spouses here - making them the
largest group of non-native spouses in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A current restriction limiting the amount of money the mainland spouses can
inherit from their Taiwanese spouse to NT$2 million will also be lifted,
according to the draft amendment to the Statute Governing the Relations between
the People of Taiwan Area and the People of Mainland Area.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said the dramatic changes are meant to "protect the
legal Chinese spouses and crack down on the illegal ones in a bid to provide
better protection to the working, ID card and property rights of legal Chinese
spouses."</P>
      <P>Liu noted that the Chinese spouses are a part of Taiwan's society, and that the
government has to address their rights so that they feel accepted here.</P>
      <P>However, mindful that some parts of the population remain wary of mainlanders,
fearing they will take local people's jobs or believing they are gold diggers,
Liu said: "The government will not allow Chinese people who come to Taiwan in
convenience marriages to work here."</P>
      <P>He demanded the Ministry of the Interior and other related agencies strengthen
the interview mechanism which assesses whether the marriages are real upon the
Chinese spouses' arrival and the visiting mechanism at their homes after they
begin living in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lai Shin-yuan, chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), said the
amendment signifies a major reform regarding the rights of Chinese spouses in
Taiwan and a realization of the protection of human rights.</P>
      <P>With the amended law shortening the years required for Chinese spouses to get
IDs to six years, Lai said around 31,000 Chinese spouses who have now stayed in
Taiwan for more than six years will get IDs immediately.</P>
      <P>The government also plans to scrap a regulation that has made it impossible for
the spouses to sponsor their children from a previous marriage to join them in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under the regulation, Chinese spouses have to be in Taiwan for at least eight
years before they can register their household here and another five years after
that before they can apply to have their biological children under 12 years of
age to come to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But Lai noted that after waiting eight years and then another five years, the
children would be 13 and would no longer qualify to come here under the rule.</P>
      <P>She criticized the regulation as being "unreasonable and not in line with human
rights," adding that the Ministry of the Interior will scrap it.</P>

      <P>How long should a promise remain binding?</P>
      <P>For Liao Ming-yi, a resident of Jhonghe City, Taipei County, it will be as long
as his coffee trees stay alive.</P>
      <P>Keeping a casual promise made by his great grandfather to a foreign tea trader,
Liao continues to take care of about 100 coffee trees that were previously  in
the care of his late father, grandfather and great grandfather.</P>
      <P>The trees, planted on a hillside at the end of Sinnan Road, Jhonghe City by a
British tea trader more than a hundred years ago, are still thriving.</P>
      <P>Coffee trees in general are rare in Taiwan, not to mention ones that are more
than 100 years old.</P>
      <P>According to records kept by local agricultural authorities, a British tea
trader brought about 100 Arabica coffee trees to Taiwan from Southeast Asia in
1884. The trees were planted in what is now the Haishan area, Taipei County.</P>
      <P>The following year, British traders sowed coffee seeds in Wenshan and Xizhi in
Taipei County, according to the records.</P>
      <P>However, these British traders' dream of establishing coffee plantations in
Taiwan never panned out and the few coffee trees they planted on an experimental
basis were left unattended after they withdrew from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liao's great grandfather was a tea farmer who lived in Jhonghe at the time. Liao
quoted his late great grandmother, born 108 years ago, as saying that when a
foreign tea trader was about to leave Taiwan, he asked her husband to take care
of the coffee trees.</P>
      <P>From that time on, Liao's family has cared for the trees, starting with his
great grandfather and on down the line to his grandfather, father, and now Liao
himself, although there is no record of the foreign tea trader ever returning to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The old coffee trees are still thriving and bearing fruit, and from their seeds,
one of Liao's uncles started a small coffee garden on a patch of his own
hillside land.</P>
      <P>"By taking care of these trees, we are not only keeping an ancestor's promise
but also keeping alive our memories of our ancestors and their sense of
solidarity." Liao said.</P>

      <P>Vietnamese officials in Taipei visited a local foundation Thursday to express
their appreciation for its long-term  financial  and medical  assistance  to
disadvantaged Vietnamese children.</P>
      <P>During a visit to the Taipei-based Compassion International Taiwan (CITW) , Ngu
Yen Cong Manh, deputy director of the Vietnam Economic and Cultural Office in
Taipei, voiced his gratitude for the foundation's efforts over the past 13 years
to help nearly 3,000 poor or sick children in central Vietnam.</P>
      <P>With CITW's support, he said during a speech on cross-cultural cooperation,
children who used to wander the streets can now go to school and receive a
formal education. In addition, a medical scheme that the CITW has been promoting
has benefited children who suffer deformities as a result of residue from
chemicals used during the Vietnam War, the official added.</P>
      <P>CITW CEO Jay Hung noted that as the high inflation rate in Vietnam has deterred
some poor families in the Southeast Asian country from sending their children to
school, his organization will increase its school funding to alleviate the
burden on these families.</P>
      <P>The foundation will also conduct a survey to ascertain which families are in
need, Hung went on, adding that it will also launch a plan to cooperate with 10
local elementary schools to promote the fun of reading.</P>
      <P>Hung said the foundation welcomes donations to help such deprived children, and

      <P>The head of Taiwan's top research institution on Thursday welcomed the
possibility that U.S. President-elect Barack Obama will name Nobel physicist
Steven Chu as his secretary of energy.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Chi-Huey Wong said Chu, a co-winner of the 1997 Nobel
Prize in Physics, has maintained close and cordial relations with the Academia
Sinica - Taiwan's top research institute.</P>
      <P>"If Chu is named by Obama as the new U.S. energy secretary, it will be conducive
to closer cooperation in the field of sciences between Taiwan and the United
States," Wong said.</P>
      <P>U.S. media this week reported that Chu is one of the candidates being considered
by Obama for the post.</P>
      <P>If Chu is named the U.S. energy secretary, he will be the second Cabinet-level
minister of Chinese descent in U.S. history, after Secretary of Labor Elaine L.
Chao. The 55-year-old Taiwan-born Chao is currently the highest-ranking American
official of Chinese descent in the United States.</P>
      <P>Chu was born in the United States. His parents were both from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chu, known for his research in laser cooling and the trapping of atoms, which
won him the Nobel Prize in Physics, has just returned to the United States from
Taiwan, where he attended an Academia Sinica-sponsored forum of heads of
prominent science institutes from around the world from Dec. 6-7.</P>
      <P>During that forum, Chu delivered a keynote speech, titled: "The World's Energy
Problem and What We Can Do About It".</P>
      <P>Chu is currently a professor of physics and molecular and cellular biology at
the University of California, Berkeley and the director of the Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory.</P>
      <P>As warnings about global warming grow more dire, Chu is currently pushing his
scientists at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and industry players to
develop technologies to reduce the impact of climate change by reducing
greenhouse gas emissions.</P>

      <P>The Tainan county government plans to turn a disused salt field into a wetland
area that will benefit the county's ecology conservation, a local official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The county government will spend five years transforming the 16-hectare disused
salt field in Chiku township into a wetland ecology park, according to Yang Ya-
chu, an official of the county's Department of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>Yang, who is a member of the department's forest biodiversity and conservation
section, pointed out that growing trees is a lot more difficult on salt land
than on ordinary farmland, and he admitted that Taiwan has had no success in
turning salt fields into productive land.</P>
      <P>In order to achieve a better chance of success, the local government has
commissioned scholars and experts from National Chiayi University, National
Pingtung University of Science and Technology, and the Taiwan Forestry Research
Institute to evaluate and design the tree-planting project, and signed a
contract Wednesday with the company that will carry out the project.</P>
      <P>The company will first clear up a one-meter layer of clay under the salt field
before connecting drainage pipes to ditches leading to the sea to help remove
the salt from the land.</P>
      <P>A flood pool will then be dug at the center to collect rainwater, and littoral
plants such as mangroves will be planted around the pool to function as a
windbreak, Yang said.</P>
      <P>Yang said the county government hopes to see the project pay off within five
years, although he said a subsidy of NT$40 million (US$1.2 million) from the
central government is barely enough even for the project's initial phase, which
will last until the end of next rear.</P>

      <P>Chang Gung University has developed a new set of augmented reality technologies
for brain surgery that can shorten the time needed for surgery and reduce the
risks involved, neurologists reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>The technologies, invented by researchers at the Chang Gung University and Chang
Gung Memorial Hospital in Taoyuan, combine holographic display, augmented-
reality surgery, an automated skull- opening drill, and customized tools for
skull repair implants.</P>
      <P>Unlike virtual reality (VR) , which uses computer-generated graphics to recreate
items on a screen, augmented reality (AR) creates images by modifying  real-time
images of objects with additional computer-generated graphics.</P>
      <P>Explaining the function of the technology, Lee Shih- tseng, director of the
Medical Augmented Reality Research and Development Center operated by the
university and hospital, said holographic displays can analyze medical data to
produce a "remodeled" skull on screen, which allows 360-degree inspection and
free removal of all bone and tissue.</P>
      <P>Lee said that with the holographic display, brain surgeons can get a better idea
of their patients' conditions and can determine the best path and means of
surgery.</P>
      <P>The complimentary technology of AR surgery, said Lee, allows the surgeon to
operate on the model skull using a scalpel-like device that provides feedback
and emulates the characteristics of blood vessel, tumor or bone.</P>
      <P>"With the AR surgery, surgeons can practice the process in advance to reduce
risk and avoid mistakes in the real operation, " Lee said.</P>
      <P>In real surgery, Lee continued, the automated skull-opening drill will help
control collateral damage by precisely measuring the depth of the drill, while
the implant customization tool can precisely measure one or more bone plates
that have to be replaced, and assist in producing implants that will fit
perfectly with other surrounding bone.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the tool has been used on nearly 50 patients with good
results.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Proposal to revise election law draws heated debate</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 11 (CNA)
12/12/08  00:10:47
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A proposal to revise the election law was debated heatedly Thursday, one day
after a lawmaker of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) had his election annulled by the
Taichung High Court.</P>
      <P>The court rejected Lu E-jin's appeal against a Miaoli District Court ruling in
May that annulled his Jan. 12 election on vote-buying charges.</P>
      <P>Lu, a first-term lawmaker, was the first of six legislators involved in
election-related lawsuits to lose his seat. However, the loss was not expected
to have a major impact on the legislature, which is dominated by the KMT,
controlling along with its allies nearly 75 percent of the seats. The main
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) controls only 27 seats.</P>
      <P>Lu, a former secretary-general of the Miaoli County Farmers' Association,  was
elected with 64,817 votes,  beating two-term Legislator Tu Wen-ching of the DPP,
who received 46,905 ballots.</P>
      <P>Soon after his election, however, Lu and two of his campaign staff were indicted
on vote-buying charges.</P>
      <P>The district court ruled that 16 visits Lu made to temples to donate money
through campaign aides in Yuanli and Ghunan -- two of the eight townships in one
of Miaoli's County's two constituencies -- between June and October last year
were undertaken to solicit support for his election bid.</P>
      <P>The court said Lu had not been known previously to have made donations to the
temples and had only done so during the election campaign.</P>
      <P>Lu said Thursday that "it is only normal to make donations to temples" and
denied that his donations were vote-buying. He added that members of his family
will take part in the by-election for the legislative vacancy left by his
annulment, adding that if the KMT nominates his wife, she will "run to the end."</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lin Tsang-min proposed a revision to the Public Officials
Election and Recall Law, which stipulates that an incumbent legislator be
stripped of his or her seat on the day the High Court annuls his or her
election.</P>
      <P>Lin proposed that an election should only be annulled upon conviction after the
third or final ruling by the Supreme Court, and that the six-month time limit on
each level of the court's litigation process should be scrapped.</P>
      <P>The proposal was put on the agenda for Friday, but the KMT legislative caucus,
possibly aware of the controversy over the proposal, decided that it would be
discussed at a later date.</P>
      <P>Chang Sho-wen, a KMT legislative caucus whip, said the proposal will still be
fully discussed by lawmakers, as the DPP has expressed stiff opposition.</P>
      <P>Judicial Yuan officials said Thursday that such a revision of the law governing
election lawsuits could lengthen the litigation process to continue until even
after the related party has served the full term.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Justice said it is not opposed to a revision of the
law, but will respect the views of the agency in charge -- the Ministry of the
Interior.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors said that election lawsuits are a major tool in the battle to
achieve clean elections and that if the litigation cannot be expedited but is in
fact lengthened, then even the most rigorous crackdowns on vote-buying will lose
their significance.</P>

      <P>Prosecutors may conclude investigations Friday into several high-profile money-
related crimes allegedly implicating former President Chen Shui-bian and may
recommend severe penalties for Chen, judicial sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, nearly 30 suspects, including Chen, will be indicted
for their roles in four major cases -- embezzlement of a special presidential
fund, money laundering and taking bribes in a science park land deal and a trade
exhibition hall construction project.</P>
      <P>The sources said prosecutors  at the Special Investigation Division (SID) under
the Supreme Prosecutors Office are very busy these days as they are scheduled to
finalize probes into the four complicated cases Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen Yun-nan, director of the SID office, would not confirm whether
investigations into those cases will be concluded anytime soon. He just said
that members of the investigative team are very busy in recent days.</P>
      <P>After a heated debate, judicial sources said, prosecutors have come to terms on
seeking harsh penalties for the former president in light of the severity of the
crimes he committed and his attitude in the course of hearings.</P>
      <P>The sources said prosecutors may recommend a prison term longer than 25 years
for Chen Shui-bian because the four crimes he allegedly committed were all very
serious.</P>
      <P>According to SID investigations, those who could be indicted in the "special
state affairs" fund embezzlement case will include former President Chen,
former first lady Wu Shu-jen,  former presidential office cashier Chen Chen-hui
and Chen Shui-bian's close aides Lin Teh-hsun and Ma Yung-cheng.</P>
      <P>Nine suspects, including Chen Shui-bian,  Wu Shu-jen, Chen Shui-bian's son and
daughter-in-law  Chen Chih-chung and Huang Jui-ching as well as Wu Shu-jen's
older brother Wu Ching-mao, will be indicted in the money-laundering case, the
sources said.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian and Wu Shu-jen will also be indicted for taking bribes in the
Lungtan land development project, the sources said, adding that investigations
into bribery in the Nangang Exhibition Hall construction project are jointly
handled by the SID and the Taipei District Prosecutors Office.</P>
      <P>The SID will be responsible for indictment of Wu Shu-jen and Tsai Ming-jhe for
their roles in the Nangang project, while the Taipei District Prosecutors Office
will handle indictment of other suspects in the case, including former Interior
Minister Yu Cheng-hsien and 15 scholars responsible for evaluation of the
project.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, sources said investigations into other cases impicating the former
president and his family members, such as taking bribes from local financial
groups, are still ongoing.</P>

      <P>Changhua County in central Taiwan has topped the country in terms of its
firefighting performance in a national evaluation, the county's Fire Bureau
Director-General Hsiao Chia-cheng said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The fire bureau's performance was designated as "excellent" this year, receiving
top ratings in five major categories -- fire prevention, disaster rescue and
relief, local residents' involvement in firefighting efforts, fire disaster
investigations and emergency medical treatment.</P>
      <P>Hsiao said the National Fire Agency under the Ministry of the Interior conducts
the annual evaluation in seven major categories, with more than 200 rating
items  on each city and county's firefighting performance.</P>
      <P>The county won fifth place in 2005, third in 2006 and first in 2007, winning top
ratings in four major categories, Hsiao noted.</P>
      <P>The bureau has set up an efficient information management system on disaster
reporting and vehicle and personnel dispatch. It also promotes training in
cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR, among local residents.</P>
      <P>About 20,000 local residents have received CPR training over the past two years,
Hsiao went on adding that the bureau will keep promoting CPR with the aim of
having at least one in 10 people trained in the life-saving skill.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Central bank announces further interest rate cuts</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  11 (CNA)
12/12/08  10:32:44
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's central bank announced Thursday that it will further lower its
benchmark interest rates by 0.75 percentage points from Friday as inflationary
pressure has eased while the risks of a further downturn to the domestic economy
are rising amid the global financial turmoil.</P>
      <P>It will be the second-largest interest rate cut in the country's history and the
fifth time the central bank has adjusted downward its key lending rates since
September, when the global economy went into a recession because of fallout from
the U.S. subprime crisis.</P>
      <P>After the latest adjustments, the central bank's key lending rates will return
to the levels recorded in July 2005, with the discount rate --  the interest
rate the central bank charges depository institutions that borrow reserves from
it -- falling to 2 percent, the rate on accommodations with collateral to 2.375
percent and the rate on accommodations without collateral to 4.25 percent.</P>
      <P>Perng Fai-nan, governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of China (CBC) ,
told a news conference held after a meeting of the bank's board of directors and
supervisors that the interest rate cut is expected to help spur domestic demand
and buttress economic growth.</P>
      <P>Quoting a forecast by the Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics, Perng said the consumer price index will grow a mere
0.37 percent next year, which will help ease inflationary pressure and stabilize
domestic commodity prices.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he went on, the job market might face even gloomier prospects and
the unemployment rate will probably climb further as the country's exports --
the growth engine of the local economy -- have continued to shrink for three
consecutive months.</P>
      <P>Perng urged local banks not to withhold lending to normally operating business
corporations at this trying time in order to keep the local economy afloat.</P>
      <P>He also told local companies to make good use of the current low interest rates
to launch long-term  investments  to facilitate corporate  restructuring  or
transformation  and upgrade  their competitive edges.</P>
      <P>For its part, Perng said, the central bank will maintain its measured monetary
policy that will feature timely adjustments in a gradual manner.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) announced Friday a series of
plans to help workers and jobless people enhance their vocational skills with a
budget of NT$2.7 billion (US$81 million) , in the hope of easing the
unemployment upsurge.</P>
      <P>"The plans will help workers accumulate vocational skills and boost the
competitiveness  of enterprises  in terms of future development," CLA Minister
Wang Ju-hsuan said at a press conference.</P>
      <P>Chen Yi-min, director-general of the Bureau of Employment and Vocational
Training, said vocational training is an investment for the future and a way to
help enterprises  ensure sustainable operations.</P>
      <P>The vocational training plans are expected to provide assistance to 200,000
people, both workers and jobless people.</P>
      <P>According to the CLA's plans, enterprises will be encouraged to apply for
subsidies of 50 percent to 100 percent of training expenses from the Bureau of
Employment and Vocational Training. Small- and medium-sized enterprises can
receive a maximum subsidy of NT$950,000, while larger enterprises can get a
maximum subsidy of NT$1.9 million.</P>
      <P>The CLA will accept enterprises' applications for their workers aged between 15
and 65, including Taiwanese workers and Chinese spouses permitted to work, as
well as foreign spouses with residence permits. Companies can file applications
until September next year.</P>
      <P>In addition, to help jobless people enhance their professional skills and return
to the employment market, the CLA will provide subsidies to encourage them to
take vocational training courses in more than 180 occupation categories. They
will also receive a living allowance during the training period.</P>
      <P>According to the CLA, more than 1,800 local companies shut down in October,

an increase of 3.48 percent compared to the same period of last year.</P>

      <P>Ex-president Chen Shui-bian was indicted Friday on money-laundering and
corruption charges, becoming the first former president in Taiwan's history to
be put on trial for criminal offenses.</P>
      <P>Instead  of seeking a specifically  defined sentence,  the prosecutors are
seeking the "harshest penalty" for the former president.</P>
      <P>They also recommended "harsh penalties" for some of the other notables indicted,
including Chen's wife Wu Shu-jen, his son Chen Chih-chung, his daughter-in-law
Huang Jui-ching.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors from the Special Investigation Division under the Supreme
Prosecutors Office also formally charged 10 other individuals for their
involvement in the former first family's alleged corruption and money-laundering
schemes.</P>
      <P>The charges are related to Chen's handling of his discretionary "state affairs
fund" during his two terms as president from 2000-2008 and the movement of funds
through proxies to overseas accounts held by Chen's wife, son and daughter-in-
law.</P>

      <P>The pilot and co-pilot of a TransAsia Airways ATR 72 aircraft whose four main
tires burst upon landing in Penghu County Thursday were grounded Friday for
negligence, with the pilot also likely to be fined.</P>
      <P>The aircraft's four main tires burst when the TransAsia flight from southern
Taiwan landed at Makung airport on Penghu Island at 10:36 a.m., but none of the
72 passengers and crew on the flight were injured.</P>
      <P>Investigators from the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) originally
suspected the accident was caused by mechanical failure or improper braking by
the pilot.</P>
      <P>They later found, however, that, in contravention of aviation regulations, the
pilot activated the emergency brake during the flight to demonstrate emergency
procedures to the co-pilot only to forget to release it before landing.</P>
      <P>As a result, the tires locked upon landing and burst under pressure from the
friction between the tires and the runway, the first time such an accident had
occurred in Taiwan's aviation history.</P>
      <P>CAA Deputy Director-General Lin Hsin-teh said the pilot and the co-pilot may be
grounded for three months to one year, while the pilot  may face fines  ranging
from NT$60,000  to NT$300,000 (US$9,090.90) for his negligence.</P>
      <P>Lin said the CAA will complete the investigation into the case in one month and
come up with a report for a CAA committee on aviation safety assessment and
evaluation, which will make a decision on further disciplinary action.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed amendments to the Income Tax Act Friday to raise
several categories of deductions for individual income taxpayers.</P>
      <P>The increased deductions will be applicable in May 2009 when 2008 tax returns
should be filed.</P>
      <P>One of those changes involves the standard deduction, which has been increased
from NT$38,000 (US$114) to NT$73,000 for single taxpayers and from NT$76,000 to
NT$146,000 for married couples filing a joint return.</P>
      <P>A salary or wage earner's special deduction has been raised from NT$75,000 to
NT$100,000, while the special deduction for the disabled has been hiked from
NT$63,000 to NT$100,000.</P>
      <P>Another of the changes concerns the deduction  for higher education expenses,
which has been adjusted from NT$25,000 per household to NT$25,000 per student.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, premiums for the national pension system have been listed as a
deductible itemized expense.</P>
      <P>The amendments mark the first time in recent years in which the deductions
stipulated in the law have been changed, although the actual deductions have
been raised several times over the past few years to reflect inflation.</P>
      <P>For the tax year 2007, for example, the standard deduction was NT$46,000 for
single taxpayers and NT$92,000 for married couples filing a joint return, while
a salary or wage earner's special deduction was NT$78,000, and the special
deduction for the disabled was NT$77,000.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance has estimated that the changes will benefit 3.6 million
households, accounting for 69 percent of the total of 5.18 million families that
file tax returns each year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Energy-conservation incentives put in place in July helped reduce power
consumption by 2.35 billion kilowatt hours between July to October from the same
period a year earlier, representing a savings of NT$3.56 billion (US$106.94
million) on electricity bills around the country, the government said Friday.</P>
      <P>The electricity rate discount program launched by The Ministry of Economic
Affairs  (MOEA)  on July  1 also contributed  to a 1.5-million-ton reduction in
carbon dioxide emissions during the four-month period, according to state-run
Taiwan Power Company statistics.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming praised the success of the incentive
measure, which was designed to promote energy conservation and greenhouse gas
emission reduction at a time when oil, natural gas and coal prices were
skyrocketing.</P>
      <P>Earlier in day, Yiin visited the home of Taipei resident Hung Juo-pu, to present
her with an award -- a folding bicycle -- for being the "master of conserving
energy" in the city.</P>
      <P>Hung won the title for saving 779 kwh, or 39.9 percent, in electricity
consumption between July and September compared to the same period in 2007.</P>
      <P>As a result, she saved a total of NT$713 on her electricity bills for the three-
month period, according to the utility.</P>
      <P>Hung's main energy-conservation  strategies  included  using energy-saving
bulbs, cleaning lamp covers regularly, and only using her washing machine two
times a week and at off-peak hours at night, she said.</P>
      <P>Under the government program, electricity rates were increased as of July 1 to
reflect rising input costs. But those household and elementary and junior high
school users who consumed less power than for the same period a year earlier
were entitled to a rate discount of between 5 percent and 20 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Academia Sinica predicts near-zero economic growth for 2009</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan's economic growth is likely to be near zero -- standing at just 0.56
percent -- for 2009 owing to the deep impact of the global financial crisis, the
Academia Sinica forecast Friday.</P>
      <P>The forecast compares with the 2.12 percent growth projected by the Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics.</P>
      <P>In its latest outlook, the Academic Sinica's Institute of Economics predicted
that Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) will record a negative growth of -2.3
percent in the fourth quarter of 2008, with the growth rate for the whole year
registering 1.72 percent.</P>
      <P>The institute said the industrial sector is expected to suffer further from a
credit crunch in 2009 as international financial market adjustments continue,
weighing inevitably on the country's unemployment rate and economic momentum.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's export sector is likely to post a rare negative growth owing to a
global economic downturn, while the worsening unemployment situation and
weakening capital market will leave very limited room for an expansion in
domestic demand, it said.</P>
      <P>Boosted  by the consumption  voucher program and increased deductions for income
taxpayers, private consumption is expected to increase by 1.42 percent in 2009.</P>
      <P>But private sector investment will remain weak, with a negative growth of -3.85
percent expected for next year, according to the institution.</P>
      <P>It predicted that the global economic freeze that began in the second half of
2008 will continue well into the first half of 2009, and Taiwan's exports of
goods and services are unlikely to recover from negative growth until the third
quarter of 2009, the institution said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the institution projected a decline of 4.25 percent in Taiwan's
wholesale price index for 2009 because of plummeting global oil and commodity
prices.</P>
      <P>The situation will greatly relieve inflationary pressure in the country, with
the consumer price index for 2009 likely to rise by a mere 0.17 percent, it
added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nongovernmental organizations on Friday criticized a Cabinet-approved amendment
that will ease restrictions on Chinese spouses married to Taiwanese residents,
saying it still did not give these new immigrants the same rights as other
foreign spouses living in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"There is a gap between our expectations and the result, " admitted Chung Jin-
ming, president of an alliance that promotes marriages between Taiwanese and
Chinese nationals.</P>
      <P>He urged President Ma Ying-jeou to fulfill his campaign promise to treat Chinese
the same way as other foreign spouses.</P>
      <P>"That's our bottom line," he said.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet approved Thursday a draft amendment to the Act Governing Relations
Between People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, shortening the time it
takes them to qualify for a Taiwan identity card.</P>
      <P>The draft amendment will be sent to the Legislative Yuan for review. If
approved, it will take Chinese immigrants six years, instead of the current
eight, to qualify for a Taiwanese identity card.</P>
      <P>But for other foreign spouses, mostly originating from Southeast Asian
countries, such as Vietnam and Indonesia, it takes only four years to get an
identity card.</P>
      <P>Wang Chuan-ping, president of the New Immigrants Labor Rights Association,
expressed herregretsthat the Cabinet decided to mandate a waiting period of six
years before Chinese spouses can apply for a Taiwan identity card.</P>
      <P>She said that her association will begin lobbying legislators next week in a bid
to convince them to change the length of the ID card waiting period to the same
as for other foreign spouses.</P>
      <P>Among  other adjustments  included  in the Cabinet-approved amendment was
eliminating the cap on the amount Chinese immigrants could inherit from their
Taiwanese spouses, which currently stands at NT$2 million.</P>
      <P>They can also obtain work permits as long as they enter Taiwan legally, instead
of having to meet specific existing requirements, such as having lived in Taiwan
for at least two years, having children or being in a low-income household.</P>
      <P>In terms of the changes, Chung described the Cabinet's decision as "postponed
justice."</P>
      <P>There are an estimated 290,000 Chinese spouses in Taiwan, representing the
largest group of foreign spouses in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The chairman of Taipei Medical University (TMU) was recently cited by the Hong
Kong-based Asian Knowledge Management Association  (AKMA)  for outstanding
achievement in facilitating medical reforms in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee Tsu-teh, a TMU alumnus who majored in dentistry and has been chairman of the
Taiwanese Business Association in Tangshan in northern China since 1996, was
conferred with an Asian Knowledge Management Association Award for corporations
by the AKMA at a ceremony held at the University of Hong Kong Dec. 9.</P>
      <P>Lee was the only citizen from Taiwan to be honored with the prestigious award
this year.</P>
      <P>After being elected a board member of TMU in 1995 in his capacity as a TMU
alumnus, Lee soon helped unite the university that had long been splintered by
internal strife and financial deficits.</P>
      <P>Lee then was elected chairman of the university's board of directors because of
his shrewd moves to help the privately-run medical university emerge from its
personnel and financial quagmire.</P>
      <P>Over the past decade, Lee also pushed TMU to incorporate Taipei City Hospital's
Wan Fang Branch, enabling the branch to become profitable within a few years.</P>
      <P>Lee was also instrumental in facilitating TMU's takeover of the management of
Shuang Ho Hospital located in Jhonghe City, Taipei County, beating out a number
of powerful competitors, including the Taichung-based China Medical University,
Fu Jen Catholic University and Chang Gung Memorial Hospital.</P>
      <P>TMU's incorporation of Wan Fang Hospital and Shuang Ho Hospital transformed the
university and its affiliated hospitals into the largest medical service system
in the Greater Taipei area.</P>
      <P>AKMA is the first professional body in the world to have developed a series of
certification standards specific to knowledge management, intellectual property
protection and intellectual capital realization.</P>

      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian will continue to receive his retirement benefits
despite being indicted Friday on money-laundering and corruption charges,
according to a Presidential Office source.</P>
      <P>Chen will continue to receive the benefits former presidents are entitled to,
including a monthly pension of NT$250,000 (US$7,485) and reimbursement of
expenses for an office staff and chauffeur, unless he is convicted and has
exhausted all avenues for appeal, the source said.</P>
      <P>According to the law governing the benefits of retired presidents and vice
presidents, ex-presidents receive NT$8 million in overall retirement benefits in
their first year after leaving office.</P>
      <P>The amount declines annually and falls to NT$5 million by the fourth year of
their retirement and stays at that level for the rest of their lives.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen, as a former president, is entitled to have eight to 12
bodyguards provided by the National Security Bureau and the number of bodyguards
can be added if necessary, according to the law.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office calculated recently that the year-end bonus that Chen
will be receiving soon totals NT$507,688.</P>
      <P>In related news, the Presidential Office would not comment on Chen's indictment
Friday, saying only that the government respects all decisions made by the
judiciary.</P>
      <P>The Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutors Office asked in
its 209-page indictment that judges of the Taipei District Court give the former
president "the harshest penalty" and requested that Chen continue to be detained
pending probes into other criminal cases in which he may be implicated.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors also recommended "harsh penalties" for some of the other
notables indicted, including Chen's wife Wu Shu-jen, his son Chen Chih-chung,
his daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching.</P>
      <P>They also formally charged 10 other individuals for their involvement in the
former first family's alleged corruption and money-laundering schemes.</P>
      <P>The charges are related to Chen's handling of his discretionary "state affairs

    <HEADLINE>Gondola's damaged support pillar should be relocated: engineers</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 12 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Four associations of professional engineers in Taipei city finalized their
assessment of the damage to a support structure on the Maokong Gondola system
Friday and recommended that relocating the eroded pillar would be the best
choice to deal with the problem.</P>
      <P>Shih Yi-fang, the spokesman for the groups of civil engineers, experts in
structure engineering,  soil and water conservation technicians and geotechnical
engineers, made the recommendation as the groups released their final report on
the damage to Tower No.16 on the cable car system.</P>
      <P>Shih said they have concluded that the most suitable spot for T-16 would be
20-30 meters away from its current location, closer to Tower No. 17.</P>
      <P>It is better for the new T-16 to be erected between T-17 and the damaged pillar
and in a straight line with them, he said.</P>
      <P>The 120-page report attributed the problem to a cave-in on the hillside where
the damaged pillar is located, and concluded that the cave-in occurred because
of the area's "unsuitable geology" for the support structure and an unusually
high volume of rainfall.</P>
      <P>The report described T-16 as a "casualty of the cave-in."</P>
      <P>The geology problem could have been detected by drilling at the spot before the
tower was constructed, the report stated, adding however that the recent data
collected for T-16 was obtained by drilling at a spot some 70 meters away from
its current location.</P>
      <P>According to a preliminary estimate by city officials, relocating the tower
would cost at least NT$200 million (US$6 million) and would take two years,
while reinforcing the existing tower at its current location would take only six
months.</P>
      <P>The gondola, one of the most popular tourist attractions in the capital city,
connects Taipei City Zoo and the Maokong tea production area in the Muzha
district. The service was closed indefinitely on Oct. 1 on fears that T-16 could
collapse during an earthquake.</P>
      <P>Torrential rain brought by Typhoon Jangmei in September eroded the tower's base,
leaving its foundation exposed.</P>
      <P>Taipei city government spokesman Yang Hsiao-tung said that the findings in the
engineers' report proved that the cave-in, which poses a threat to a nearby
community, was not caused by the construction of the gondola system.</P>
      <P>The city government will begin work to stabilize the eroded slope and reinforce
the foundation of the problematic pillar, and at the same time, will select the
best site for the relocation of T-16, he said.</P>
      <P>Yang said the city government will do its utmost to resume operation of the
cable car system, which he described as the public's favorite leisure facility.</P>
      <P>However, there is now no fixed schedule for the resumption of the service, he
added.</P>
      <P>According to the Taipei Rapid Transit Corp. which operates the Maokong Gondola,
over 6.1 million passengers had ridden the system as of Oct. 1 since its
official inauguration on July 4, 2007.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ex-president Chen Shui-bian was indicted Friday on money laundering, corruption
and forgery charges involving nearly half a billion Taiwan dollars, becoming the
first former president in Taiwan's history to be put on trial for criminal
offenses.</P>
      <P>Instead  of seeking a specifically  defined sentence,  the prosecutors are
seeking the "harshest penalty" for Taiwan's former leader.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors from the Special Investigation Division under the Supreme
Prosecutors Office also formally charged Chen's wife Wu Shu-jen, his son Chen
Chih-chung and his daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching, and recommended they receive
"harsh penalties."</P>
      <P>In addition, prosecutors indicted 10 other individuals for their involvement in
the former first family's alleged corruption and money-laundering schemes.</P>
      <P>In a news conference called to announce the indictment, Chen Yun-nan, chief of
the division, said Chen Shui-bian's purported offenses were staggering and
allowed him to obtain ill-gotten gains on a scale "never seen before."</P>
      <P>His offenses were all the more objectionable because he had sworn to abide by
the lay in carrying out his duties as president, and therefore should be
punished to the full extent of the law, the leading prosecutor said.</P>
      <P>As to the ex-first lady, Chen Yun-nan said she deserves a harsh penalty for
using her status to interfere with her husband's administration's decisions in
exchange for personal profits.</P>
      <P>The ex-president's son and daughter-in-law, who are the holders of many of their
family's overseas bank accounts, should also be punished harshly for refusing to
reveal until now their overseas wealth.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors in charge of the investigation of the case suspect those bank
accounts were used to conceal some of their parents' ill-gotten assets.</P>
      <P>The indictment charged Chen Shui-bian and his wife of illegally receiving or
embezzling NT$490 million, including NT$204.15 million and US$8.73 million, some
of which was sent overseas.</P>
      <P>Of that total, the indictment reads, NT$104.15 million was embezzled from the
state affairs fund set aside for the president's discretionary use during his
eight years in office from 2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors charge that more than NT$27 million of that was obtained by using
inappropriate receipts to claim reimbursement from the fund, nearly double the
NT$14.8 million Wu was originally indicted for embezzling from the fund in 2006.</P>
      <P>The balance, or more than NT$76 million,  was claimed by Presidential Office
cashier Chen Chen-hui as "secret funds" from the state affairs fund and handed
over to Wu Shu-jen to pay for the family's daily living expenses and other uses,
the indictment alleges.</P>
      <P>The ex-first family allegedly received Another NT$100 million and US$6 million
in kickbacks from a total payoff of US$11.98 million by a development company
called "Dayu" to pave the way for the Hsinchu Science Park to buy a plot of land
held by Dayu in Taoyuan County at a price prosecutors believe was unreasonably
high.</P>
      <P>The balance of the bribe money was pocketed by James Lee, then-chief of the
Hsinchu Science Park, and Tsai Ming-jhe, who transferred the kickback to
accounts held by ex-first family members, prosecutors charged.</P>
      <P>The indictment accuses the former first family of collecting another US$2.73
million in bribes from contractor Kuo Chuan-ching to help him win a tender to
build the Nangang Exhibition Hall between 2002 and 2003.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors believe Kuo won the contract by bribing members of a panel organized
by the Ministry of Interior to assess the bidding after then-Interior Minister
Yu Cheng-hsien revealed the list of panel members to Kuo at the request of Wu
Shu-jen.</P>
      <P>Yu Cheng-hsien was separately indicted by the Taipei District Prosecutors Office
Friday for leaking secrets.</P>
      <P>As for the other 10 defendants, the prosecutor asked the court to hand down
lenient punishments or spare them because they have shown remorse and thoroughly
testified to their roles in the case.</P>
      <P>They  included  Wu  Shu-jen's  brother  Wu Ching-mao,  her sister-in-law Chen
Chun-ying, her university classmate Tsai Mei-li, and Tsai's brothers Tsai Ming-
jhe and Tsai Ming-jie.</P>
      <P>They were all charged with helping the ex-first family collect bribes and wire
them abroad.</P>
      <P>Also included were Chen Shui-bian's former aides, cashier Chen Chen-hui,
Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General Ma Yung-cheng, and the head of the
president's office Lin Teh-hsun.</P>
      <P>They were accused of helping the ex-first family illegally claim reimbursements
from the state affairs fund.</P>
      <P>Former Hsinchu Science Park chief Lee and businessman Kuo were also indicted for
helping the ex-first family solicit bribes and line their own pockets with a
portion of the revenues.</P>
      <P>Of the 14 defendants, only the former president is still being held in custody.</P>
      <P>The ex-first family's possible engagement in money laundering come to light
after the anti-money laundering group, The Egmont Group, alerted Taipei in late
2006 and early 2008 of millions of U.S. dollars stashed in overseas bank
accounts held by their family members.</P>
      <P>In one instance of the alleged intricate money laundering scheme, prosecutors
tracked Kuo's kickback to a bank account held by Tsai Ming-jhe in Hong Kong,
then to a Standard Bank account held by Wu Ching-mao in Singapore.</P>
      <P>The funds were then transferred to Huang Jui-ching's Merrill Lynch Bank account
in Switzerland and an account in RBS Coutts Bank in Switzerland held by Chen
Chih-chung under the name Galahad Management S.A.</P>
      <P>The former president admitted on August 14 that his wife had remitted more than
US$20 million overseas, but said the funds were surplus contributions to his
campaigns for Taipei City mayor in 1994 and 1998 and the presidency in 2000 and
2004.</P>
      <P>Friday's indictment may not be the last legal challenge the former first family
faces. Chen Shui-bian and his wife are still being probed for helping several
financial conglomerates acquire financial  holding  companies  in return  for
their "political contributions."</P>
      <P>Wu Shu-jen has already been indicted in 2006 for embezzling NT$14.8 million from
the state affairs fund and the trial is ongoing.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian was not charged at the time because he held presidential
immunity.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Coral survey suggests huge quakes may hit South Asia in next decades</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 12 (CNA)
12/12/08  20:54:53
(By Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An international survey of the coral reefs off Indonesia indicates that a series
of huge earthquakes are likely to hit South Asia in the coming decades, packing
destructive power similar to the magnitude 9.3 quake that triggered a
devastating tsunami in Southeast Asia in Dec. 2004.</P>
      <P>According to an article published in the latest issue of the weekly journal
Science, a research team composed of scientists from Indonesia, Taiwan, and the
United States studied seismic patterns over the past 700 years and hypothesized
the existence of an "earthquake supercycle" every 200 years.</P>
      <P>During the supercycle, a magnitude-8 quake would mark the beginning of a new
cycle, one or more magnitude-8 quakes would follow, and a super quake of about
magnitude 9 would end the cycle by consuming much of the tectonic energy
accumulated over the past two centuries.</P>
      <P>The magnitude-8.4 temblor of September 2007, they reported, is the "opening
salvo" in the 30-year period of each supercycle of quakes in the region when
seismic activity peaks.</P>
      <P>The researchers suggested that a quake with a magnitude of between 7 to 8 will
occur every six to 13 years, and a super quake of magnitude 9 will hit South
Asia in about 30 years.</P>
      <P>The study -- conducted by scientists from Indonesia, Taiwan, and the United
States -- derived their conclusions from an analysis of dead corals off
Sumatra's Mentawai Islands to get a better idea of how corals are affected by
earthquakes, especially those of magnitude 7 or above.</P>
      <P>The scientists explained that huge earthquakes in the past would lift the reefs
by one meter or more above the sea's surface and cause the massive die-off of
coral reefs.</P>
      <P>These dead corals left behind, much to the team's surprise, mineral structures
that explicitly recorded the time and scale of almost every large earthquake in
the area over the past 700 years.</P>
      <P>"Each incident triggered widespread coral deaths, but the long- lasting mineral
structures built by the colonies enable scientists to estimate  the dates of the
massive  quakes that caused those upheavals," said Aron J. Meltzner, a
participant from the California Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>The earthquakes "recorded" in coral structures occurred in 1374, 1596, 1675,
1797, 1833 and 2007.</P>
      <P>In the "coral records of earthquakes," the scientists discerned a pattern for
the earthquakes in the region, namely the supercycle theory. They used the
theory and the temblor of September 2007 to reach the conclusion that a new
supercycle has already begun.</P>
      <P>The Dec. 2004 earthquake was not considered in the study because its epicenter
was located 150 kilometers northwest of the northern tip of Sumatra Island and
had probably consumed much of the tectonic energy in its area.</P>
      <P>The study's area of investigation was much farther south off the Sumatra coast
and part of a different tectonic system, according to Shen Chuan-chou, a project
member from National Taiwan University.</P>
      <P>A separate study reported in the Dec. 4 Nature also suggested that the region's
2007 quake released only one-quarter of the energy that had accumulated since
1833, so the quakes in the region in the coming decades may be even larger than
expected.</P>
      <P>"If the supercycle theory proves true, the South Asian countries should stay
alert for possible huge earthquakes and step up their efforts to establish the
earthquake/tsunami early warning network, " Shen said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The indictment against former President Chen Shui-bian on corruption and money
laundering charges is inaccurate and basically a "purge of officials of the
previous administration, " Chen's lawyers said Friday.</P>
      <P>The lawyers, including Cheng Sheng-chu, Cheng Wen-lung, Lee Sheng-hsiung and Lee
Sheng-chen, made the remarks after Chen was indicted earlier in the day in
connection  with a series of corruption-related scandals involving himself and
family members.</P>
      <P>The charges were the first filed against Chen since his Nov.12 arrest and
detention. No other former Taiwan president has ever faced criminal prosecution.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors have recommended that the former president be given the harshest
sentence for his alleged illegalities involving nearly half a billion Taiwan
dollars.</P>
      <P>Indicted together with Chen were his wife, Wu Shu-jen, his son Chen Chih-chung,
his daughter-in-law, Huang Jui-ching, three of his former aides in the
Presidential Office, and seven other associates.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said the former president and his wife together embezzled  NT$104
million  (US$3.12  million)  from a special presidential fund during Chen's
presidency from 2000-2008.</P>
      <P>They also took bribes worth NT$100 million and US$6 million in connection with a
land procurement deal and another US$2.73 million in kickbacks to help a
contractor win the tender for a government construction project, prosecutors
charged.</P>
      <P>Cheng Sheng-chu said he was not surprised by the indictment of the former first
couple, but he insisted that all the charges against Chen Shui-bian and Wu Shu-
jen as well as the 12 other defendants are not factual.</P>
      <P>For one thing, Cheng said, prosecutors overlooked the fact that local
politicians tend to accept political contributions.</P>
      <P>"Prosecutors cast the Chen family's huge cash assets in a negative light and
then tried to seek evidence to back their conjecture.</P>
      <P>"In the process, they had to detain many potential suspects and enticed the
detainees to become witnesses for the state, " Cheng contended, adding that the
conjecture and evidence presented in the indictment are full of contradictions
and not solid.</P>
      <P>He also questioned the propriety of the presidential fund embezzlement charges
against Chen, arguing that the use of the fund belonged to the president's
administrative power, which should be free of interference by judicial
authorities.</P>
      <P>Another of Chen's lawyers, Cheng Wen-lung, said he felt a bit disappointed when
he read the indictment, which he described as "not well argued."</P>
      <P>Accusing prosecutors of squeezing testimony from detainees has infringed upon
the human rights of suspects.</P>
      <P>"The prosecution has failed to uphold the due process of law and justice," he
asserted.</P>

      <P>The brother-in-law of ex-President Chen Shui-bian apologized to the public
Friday for the social costs caused by his role in helping with the alleged money
laundering of the former first family.</P>
      <P>Wu made the apology in an interview with television reporters after the Special
Investigation Division (SID) of the Supreme Prosecutors  Office indicted 14
people upon conclusion of its investigation into the money laundering and
corruption cases that prosecutors charged netted the former first family NT$490
million (US$14.71 million) in illegal gains.</P>
      <P>Although Wu was one of the 14 defendants being prosecuted, the SID's indictment
recommended to the court that his sentence be reduced to the minimum in
consideration of the fact that he was fully cooperative during the
investigation.</P>
      <P>"I appreciate the Special Investigation Division's understanding, " Wu said. "I
was willing to cooperate fully with the prosecutors in their investigation, and
I regretted what I had done."</P>
      <P>Asked how he felt about the prosecution describing the conduct of his sister --
the former first lady Wu Shu-jen -- as a "serious violation of the law," he said
it will be up to the court to judge whether that is the case.</P>
      <P>In its indictment, the SID asked the court to mete out the "harshest" sentence
to the former president and "heavy" penalties for his wife, son and daughter-in-
law, while seeking commuted sentences for the other 10 defendants, including Wu
Ching-mao, because they were cooperative during the investigation.</P>
      <P>Wu was released on Nov. 28 on bail of NT$2 million after being detained for 53
days as prosecutors investigated allegations that he used his accounts in
Singapore to help his sister transfer US$20 million  to two bank  accounts  in
Switzerland  held  by her daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching.</P>
      <P>The investigation began after Swiss authorities suspected money laundering and
sought information about the account holder from Taiwan's judicial authorities.</P>
      <P>The SID later also obtained information from Singapore's judicial authorities,
tracing the money to an account at South Africa's Standard Bank in Singapore
owned by Wu Ching-mao, who received the money in several transactions from bank
accounts in Hong Kong held by the former first lady's college classmate Tsai
Mei-li and Tsai's two brothers.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's investigative authorities received a report from the international
anti-money laundering organization The Egmont Group in January  this  year
regarding  the Cayman  Islands'  financial intelligence unit's suspicions that
the former first family was laundering money through an account created under
the name of Chen's daughter-in-law at the Merrill Lynch Bank in Geneva,
Switzerland.</P>
      <P>However, instead of ordering an investigation into the suspected money
laundering, the then Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau Director-General
Yeh Sheng-mao showed the report to the then president -- the chief suspect who
should have been the target of the investigation.</P>
      <P>In early December, the Taipei District Court sentenced Yeh to 10 years in prison
after finding him guilty of corruption, of concealing a government file and of
leaking confidential information.</P>

      <P>The residence of Chang Hsueh-liang (1901-2001), who was a key figure in the
modern history of China, was formally opened to the public Friday, in the hope
that the historic site in the Wufeng township of Hsinchu County will attract
tourists, particularly those from China.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou cut the ribbons at the ceremony to unveil two bronze
statues of Chang and Chang's wife Chao I-ti. Also at the ceremony were members
of Chang's family, and Guo Junsheng, curator of a museum in Shenyiang,
northeastern China, dedicated to the Chang's son.</P>
      <P>Chang was placed under house arrest in Wufeng in northern Taiwan and held until
1990 for his role as the instigator of the Xian Incident that occurred in Xian
in the central China province of Shaanxi on Dec. 12, 1936.</P>
      <P>On that date, Chang kidnapped the leader of the Kuomintang (KMT) government
Chiang Kai-shek and held him hostage until Chiang agreed to form a united front
with the Communists of China against the Japanese.</P>
      <P>Chiang at the time held a non-aggressive position regarding Japan and considered
the Communists to be a greater danger to the government of the Republic of China
than the Japanese. His overall strategy, therefore, was to annihilate the
Communists before focusing his efforts on the Japanese. However, growing
nationalist anger against Japan made this position very unpopular, leading to
Chang's action against Chiang.</P>
      <P>The operation cost Chang his freedom, as he was placed under house arrest
shortly after the incident and was not freed even after the KMT government
relocated to Taiwan in 1949 when the Communists took control of the Chinese
mainland.</P>
      <P>In his address, Ma described Chang as a "quiet and silent" historic figure, who
even after he was freed in 1990 never publicly complained of being mistreated.</P>
      <P>The raw emotions of the feud have faded since the deaths of both Chang and
Chiang, Ma said, adding that his own efforts to foster reconciliation between
Taiwan and China also include seeking forgiveness.</P>
      <P>"I hope this historic site will attract tourists," he said.</P>

      <P>The Taitung County Police Bureau has borrowed an idea from abroad to help
overworked police officers relieve stress by encouraging them to smash
dinnerware at a training camp.</P>
      <P>Some of the officers who took part in the stress-relief program said Friday that
they felt great when they heard the ceramic plates breaking against a wall.</P>
      <P>"I felt like the pressure on me was gone," said one of the officers as he

      <P>The police bureau collected 400 unwanted plates from restaurants in the county
for the program. Each officer was allowed to smash three plates.</P>
      <P>Pent-up officers could write down their complaints or the names of the bosses
they hated most on the plates before hurling the dinnerware as hard as they
could against a stone wall.</P>
      <P>According to another police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity, the
stress comes mainly from the constant demand for good work performance.</P>
      <P>He added that unscheduled stints, irregular work shifts and pressure from
elected county councilors also contribute to the stress on police officers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei Prosecutors Office on Friday indicted former Interior Minister Yu
Cheng-hsien, construction contractor Kuo Chuan-ching and seven scholars for
their involvement in irregularities related to the construction of the Taipei
World Trade Center's Nankang Exhibition Hall.</P>
      <P>The indictment asked that the court be lenient toward Yu and Kuo, but demanded
that the seven scholars be severely punished.</P>
      <P>The indictment charged that the seven -- Cheng Tsung-jung, Wang Lung-chang,
Chiang Cher-ming, Chou Chia-peng, Chen Po-ya, Kuo Yung-chieh and Wang Cheng-ying
-- who all teach at local universities, have "pursued their own interests in
lining their own pockets during the screening of the nation's major procurement
projects and had shown no remorse."</P>
      <P>According to the indictment, Kuo promised former first lady Wu Shu-jen he would
pay 2.5 percent of the total contract value as a kickback if he won the tender.</P>
      <P>Yu told prosecutors that Wu then asked him to release the names of the seven
scholars on the project's screening panel to Kuo, the chairman of Leader
Construction Co., so that Kuo could influence the panel and help his chances of
winning the tender.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior is required by law not to reveal the names of those
on the screening panel.</P>
      <P>With the list in hand, Kuo paid between NT$500,000 and NT$1 million to each of
the panel members to secure their support and ultimately was named as the
priority bidder on the project in January 2004 before winning the contract at a
price tag of NT$3.59 billion, the indictment charged.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors  asked for leniency toward the former interior minister after
determining that Kuo's kickbacks were paid to the former first lady and not to
Yu.</P>
      <P>They also asked for leniency for Kuo, who the indictment said confessed to his
acts of wrongdoing during the investigation and took the initiative to provide
related evidence to shed more light on the case.</P>
      <P>The Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutors Office earlier
Friday indicted former President Chen Shui-bian and his wife Wu Shu-jen for
illegal gains of NT$490 million from embezzling state funds and taking bribes in

    <HEADLINE>DPP to assume political responsibility for Chen's legacies: chief</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.12 (CNA)
12/12/08  23:32:05
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is willing to assume full political
responsibility for what former President Chen Shui-bian did during his years in
office between 2000 and May 2008, the opposition party's chief said Friday.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen made the remarks after Chen was indicted earlier in
the day on corruption and money laundering charges involving himself and family
members. No other former Taiwan president has ever faced criminal prosecution.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors have recommended that the former president be given the harshest
sentence for his alleged illegalities involving nearly half a billion Taiwan
dollars.</P>
      <P>Noting that Chen is an integral part of the DPP's history, Tsai said the party
will definitely assume political responsibility for his legacies.</P>
      <P>Terming Chen's indictment marks one of the most difficult moments in the party's
history, Tsai called on all DPP members to stand united in order not to let down
its supporters.</P>
      <P>Chen, who has been detained since Nov.12, twice served as DPP chairman, but quit
the party in August after publicly confessing to doing "what the law does not
permit" by wiring a sum of money abroad. He still retains a core of enthusiastic
pro-independence supporters.</P>
      <P>Some political analysts predicted that Chen will still affect the inner workings
of the DPP and may even split party members during the course of the trial.</P>
      <P>Tsai reminded party members that the DPP has a historic mission for Taiwan and
should therefore unite to help the party move beyond its predicament.</P>
      <P>Stressing that all DPP members are kind-hearted  and have integrity, Tsai said
she expects Chen to face up to his judicial challenge and mount a vigorous
defense against the corruption charges leveled against him.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, Tsai said, the DPP will work to defend Chen's judicial rights
and human rights. She demanded an immediate end to Chen's detention to pave the
way for the beginning of a fair trial of his cases.</P>
      <P>She dismissed as speculation media reports that the DPP will turn its  back  on
Chen  or regards  him as a liability  to the pro-independence cause both Chen
and the DPP espouse.</P>
      <P>Indicted together with Chen were his wife, Wu Shu-jen, his son Chen Chih-chung,
his daughter-in-law, Huang Jui-ching, three of his former aides in the
Presidential Office, and seven other associates.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said the former president and his wife together embezzled  NT$104
million  (US$3.12  million)  from a special presidential fund during Chen's
presidency from 2000-2008.</P>
      <P>They also took bribes worth NT$100 million and US$6 million in connection with a
land procurement deal and another US$2.73 million in kickbacks to help a
contractor win the tender for a government construction project, prosecutors
charged.</P>
      <P>Both Chen Shui-bian and Wu Shu-jen have denied any wrongdoing. Chen's lawyers
described the indictment as a "purge of officials of the previous
administration."</P>
      <P>Wu's lawyers also issued a statement on her behalf, saying that the indictment
was unacceptable as prosecution charges are aimed at demonizing the former first
lady, who has been confined to a wheelchair since she was hit by a truck in
1985.</P>

      <P>The leader of the unsuccessful 2006 campaign to depose then President Chen Shui-
bian declined on Friday to comment on the indictment of Chen and three members
of the former first family, whose integrity came into question publicly at the
time amid a series of corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>Shih Ming-teh,  who served as chairman  of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party between 1994 and 1996 before quitting the party in 2000, said in a brief
statement, "I have fought the good fight against corruption, and there is no
need for me to clean the battlefield."</P>
      <P>Shih was highly critical of Chen in mid-November after the former president
staged a hunger strike while being held in a detention center to prevent him
from collusion with other defendants and witnesses in the corruption cases
involving the former first family.</P>
      <P>Shih said that Chen "trampled on the dignity of the Taiwanese people and
betrayed their expectations."</P>
      <P>Shih issued the statement  after the Special Investigation Division under the
Supreme Prosecutors Office indicted Chen, seeking the "harshest" penalty for him
on charges of money laundering, corruption and forgery involving nearly half a
billion Taiwan dollars, and making him the first former president in Taiwan's
history to face trial for criminal offenses.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors also formally charged Chen's wife Wu Shu-jen, his son Chen Chih-
chung and his daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching, and sought "heavy penalties" for
them, while recommending commuted sentences for 10 other individuals for their
involvement in the former first family's  alleged corruption  and money-
laundering schemes.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Energy-conservation incentives put in place in July helped reduce power
consumption by 2.35 billion kilowatt hours between July to October from the same
period a year earlier, representing a savings of NT$3.56 billion (US$106.94
million) on electricity bills around the country, the government said Friday.</P>
      <P>The electricity rate discount program launched by The Ministry of Economic
Affairs  (MOEA)  on July  1 also contributed  to a 1.5-million-ton reduction in
carbon dioxide emissions during the four-month period, according to state-run
Taiwan Power Company statistics.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming praised the success of the incentive
measure, which was designed to promote energy conservation and greenhouse gas
emission reduction at a time when oil, natural gas and coal prices were
skyrocketing.</P>
      <P>Earlier in day, Yiin visited the home of Taipei resident Hung Juo-pu, to present
her with an award -- a folding bicycle -- for being the "master of conserving
energy" in the city.</P>
      <P>Hung won the title for saving 779 kwh, or 39.9 percent, in electricity
consumption between July and September compared to the same period in 2007.</P>
      <P>As a result, she saved a total of NT$713 on her electricity bills for the three-
month period, according to the utility.</P>
      <P>Hung's main energy-conservation  strategies  included  using energy-saving
bulbs, cleaning lamp covers regularly, and only using her washing machine two
times a week and at off-peak hours at night, she said.</P>
      <P>Under the government program, electricity rates were increased as of July 1 to
reflect rising input costs. But those household and elementary and junior high
school users who consumed less power than for the same period a year earlier
were entitled to a rate discount of between 5 percent and 20 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Academia Sinica predicts near-zero economic growth for 2009</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economic growth is likely to be near zero -- standing at just 0.56
percent -- for 2009 owing to the deep impact of the global financial crisis, the
Academia Sinica forecast Friday.</P>
      <P>The forecast compares with the 2.12 percent growth projected by the Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics.</P>
      <P>In its latest outlook, the Academic Sinica's Institute of Economics predicted
that Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) will record a negative growth of -2.3
percent in the fourth quarter of 2008, with the growth rate for the whole year
registering 1.72 percent.</P>
      <P>The institute said the industrial sector is expected to suffer further from a
credit crunch in 2009 as international financial market adjustments continue,
weighing inevitably on the country's unemployment rate and economic momentum.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's export sector is likely to post a rare negative growth owing to a
global economic downturn, while the worsening unemployment situation and
weakening capital market will leave very limited room for an expansion in
domestic demand, it said.</P>
      <P>Boosted  by the consumption  voucher program and increased deductions for income
taxpayers, private consumption is expected to increase by 1.42 percent in 2009.</P>
      <P>But private sector investment will remain weak, with a negative growth of -3.85
percent expected for next year, according to the institution.</P>
      <P>It predicted that the global economic freeze that began in the second half of
2008 will continue well into the first half of 2009, and Taiwan's exports of
goods and services are unlikely to recover from negative growth until the third
quarter of 2009, the institution said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the institution projected a decline of 4.25 percent in Taiwan's
wholesale price index for 2009 because of plummeting global oil and commodity
prices.</P>
      <P>The situation will greatly relieve inflationary pressure in the country, with
the consumer price index for 2009 likely to rise by a mere 0.17 percent, it
added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nongovernmental organizations on Friday criticized a Cabinet-approved amendment
that will ease restrictions on Chinese spouses married to Taiwanese residents,
saying it still did not give these new immigrants the same rights as other
foreign spouses living in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"There is a gap between our expectations and the result, " admitted Chung Jin-
ming, president of an alliance that promotes marriages between Taiwanese and
Chinese nationals.</P>
      <P>He urged President Ma Ying-jeou to fulfill his campaign promise to treat Chinese
the same way as other foreign spouses.</P>
      <P>"That's our bottom line," he said.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet approved Thursday a draft amendment to the Act Governing Relations
Between People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, shortening the time it
takes them to qualify for a Taiwan identity card.</P>
      <P>The draft amendment will be sent to the Legislative Yuan for review. If
approved, it will take Chinese immigrants six years, instead of the current
eight, to qualify for a Taiwanese identity card.</P>
      <P>But for other foreign spouses, mostly originating from Southeast Asian
countries, such as Vietnam and Indonesia, it takes only four years to get an
identity card.</P>
      <P>Wang Chuan-ping, president of the New Immigrants Labor Rights Association,
expressed herregretsthat the Cabinet decided to mandate a waiting period of six
years before Chinese spouses can apply for a Taiwan identity card.</P>
      <P>She said that her association will begin lobbying legislators next week in a bid
to convince them to change the length of the ID card waiting period to the same
as for other foreign spouses.</P>
      <P>Among  other adjustments  included  in the Cabinet-approved amendment was
eliminating the cap on the amount Chinese immigrants could inherit from their
Taiwanese spouses, which currently stands at NT$2 million.</P>
      <P>They can also obtain work permits as long as they enter Taiwan legally, instead
of having to meet specific existing requirements, such as having lived in Taiwan
for at least two years, having children or being in a low-income household.</P>
      <P>In terms of the changes, Chung described the Cabinet's decision as "postponed
justice."</P>
      <P>There are an estimated 290,000 Chinese spouses in Taiwan, representing the
largest group of foreign spouses in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The chairman of Taipei Medical University (TMU) was recently cited by the Hong
Kong-based Asian Knowledge Management Association  (AKMA)  for outstanding
achievement in facilitating medical reforms in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee Tsu-teh, a TMU alumnus who majored in dentistry and has been chairman of the
Taiwanese Business Association in Tangshan in northern China since 1996, was
conferred with an Asian Knowledge Management Association Award for corporations
by the AKMA at a ceremony held at the University of Hong Kong Dec. 9.</P>
      <P>Lee was the only citizen from Taiwan to be honored with the prestigious award
this year.</P>
      <P>After being elected a board member of TMU in 1995 in his capacity as a TMU
alumnus, Lee soon helped unite the university that had long been splintered by
internal strife and financial deficits.</P>
      <P>Lee then was elected chairman of the university's board of directors because of
his shrewd moves to help the privately-run medical university emerge from its
personnel and financial quagmire.</P>
      <P>Over the past decade, Lee also pushed TMU to incorporate Taipei City Hospital's
Wan Fang Branch, enabling the branch to become profitable within a few years.</P>
      <P>Lee was also instrumental in facilitating TMU's takeover of the management of
Shuang Ho Hospital located in Jhonghe City, Taipei County, beating out a number
of powerful competitors, including the Taichung-based China Medical University,
Fu Jen Catholic University and Chang Gung Memorial Hospital.</P>
      <P>TMU's incorporation of Wan Fang Hospital and Shuang Ho Hospital transformed the
university and its affiliated hospitals into the largest medical service system
in the Greater Taipei area.</P>
      <P>AKMA is the first professional body in the world to have developed a series of
certification standards specific to knowledge management, intellectual property
protection and intellectual capital realization.</P>

"standing firm and moving forward" with more spending.</P>

      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian will continue to receive his retirement benefits
despite being indicted Friday on money-laundering and corruption charges,
according to a Presidential Office source.</P>
      <P>Chen will continue to receive the benefits former presidents are entitled to,
including a monthly pension of NT$250,000 (US$7,485) and reimbursement of
expenses for an office staff and chauffeur, unless he is convicted and has
exhausted all avenues for appeal, the source said.</P>
      <P>According to the law governing the benefits of retired presidents and vice
presidents, ex-presidents receive NT$8 million in overall retirement benefits in
their first year after leaving office.</P>
      <P>The amount declines annually and falls to NT$5 million by the fourth year of
their retirement and stays at that level for the rest of their lives.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen, as a former president, is entitled to have eight to 12
bodyguards provided by the National Security Bureau and the number of bodyguards
can be added if necessary, according to the law.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office calculated recently that the year-end bonus that Chen
will be receiving soon totals NT$507,688.</P>
      <P>In related news, the Presidential Office would not comment on Chen's indictment
Friday, saying only that the government respects all decisions made by the
judiciary.</P>
      <P>The Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutors Office asked in
its 209-page indictment that judges of the Taipei District Court give the former
president "the harshest penalty" and requested that Chen continue to be detained
pending probes into other criminal cases in which he may be implicated.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors also recommended "harsh penalties" for some of the other
notables indicted, including Chen's wife Wu Shu-jen, his son Chen Chih-chung,
his daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching.</P>
      <P>They also formally charged 10 other individuals for their involvement in the
former first family's alleged corruption and money-laundering schemes.</P>
      <P>The charges are related to Chen's handling of his discretionary "state affairs
fund" during his two terms as president from 2000-2008 and the movement of funds
through proxies to overseas accounts held by Chen's wife, son and daughter-in-
law.</P>

      <P>A 24-hour charity ultra-marathon will kick off in Taipei Saturday, with the
participation of internationally recognized runners, in the hope of providing
assistance to a Taiwanese runner who lost both legs after she contracted a
severe bacterial infection earlier this year, the organizer said Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference to announce the start of the Soochow
International Ultra-Marathon 24-hr Race, Soochow University President Hwang
Jenn-tai said that in addition to helping the runners to develop will and
perseverance, the race this year will be dedicated to Chiu Shu-jung.</P>
      <P>Chiu, a female ultra-marathon runner who broke the Asian record and placed
second in the Spartathlon race held in Greece in March, had to have a double
amputation due to a bacterial infection she contracted after completing the
18-day Trans Gaule run along a 1,150-kilometer route in France.</P>
      <P>Twenty-eight participants from around the world will run around the school
athletics track for 24 straight hours starting Saturday morning, the organizer
said. While the race is in progress, local students will stage a series of
performances at different intervals.</P>
      <P>Among the international participants, Edit Berces from Hungary, who currently
holds two world records, and Ryoichi Sekiya from Japan, who has won three world
championships titles, will be running for Chiu's cause.</P>
      <P>Sponsoring businesses will adopt the accumulated laps run the by athletes,
donating NT$100 (US$3) for each lap. The organizer is eying a target of NT$1
million.</P>
      <P>Chiu returned to Taiwan in late September after her double amputation surgery in
France, and is now in the process of recovery.</P>
      <P>The Taipei race, certified by the International Association of Ultra Runners
(IAU), is currently the only ultra-marathon held on a regular basis in Taiwan
and has produced the world's best records in five of its seven years of history.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Gondola's damaged support pillar should be relocated: engineers</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 12 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Four associations of professional engineers in Taipei city finalized their
assessment of the damage to a support structure on the Maokong Gondola system
Friday and recommended that relocating the eroded pillar would be the best
choice to deal with the problem.</P>
      <P>Shih Yi-fang, the spokesman for the groups of civil engineers, experts in
structure engineering,  soil and water conservation technicians and geotechnical
engineers, made the recommendation as the groups released their final report on
the damage to Tower No.16 on the cable car system.</P>
      <P>Shih said they have concluded that the most suitable spot for T-16 would be
20-30 meters away from its current location, closer to Tower No. 17.</P>
      <P>It is better for the new T-16 to be erected between T-17 and the damaged pillar
and in a straight line with them, he said.</P>
      <P>The 120-page report attributed the problem to a cave-in on the hillside where
the damaged pillar is located, and concluded that the cave-in occurred because
of the area's "unsuitable geology" for the support structure and an unusually
high volume of rainfall.</P>
      <P>The report described T-16 as a "casualty of the cave-in."</P>
      <P>The geology problem could have been detected by drilling at the spot before the
tower was constructed, the report stated, adding however that the recent data
collected for T-16 was obtained by drilling at a spot some 70 meters away from
its current location.</P>
      <P>According to a preliminary estimate by city officials, relocating the tower
would cost at least NT$200 million (US$6 million) and would take two years,
while reinforcing the existing tower at its current location would take only six
months.</P>
      <P>The gondola, one of the most popular tourist attractions in the capital city,
connects Taipei City Zoo and the Maokong tea production area in the Muzha
district. The service was closed indefinitely on Oct. 1 on fears that T-16 could
collapse during an earthquake.</P>
      <P>Torrential rain brought by Typhoon Jangmei in September eroded the tower's base,
leaving its foundation exposed.</P>
      <P>Taipei city government spokesman Yang Hsiao-tung said that the findings in the
engineers' report proved that the cave-in, which poses a threat to a nearby
community, was not caused by the construction of the gondola system.</P>
      <P>The city government will begin work to stabilize the eroded slope and reinforce
the foundation of the problematic pillar, and at the same time, will select the
best site for the relocation of T-16, he said.</P>
      <P>Yang said the city government will do its utmost to resume operation of the
cable car system, which he described as the public's favorite leisure facility.</P>
      <P>However, there is now no fixed schedule for the resumption of the service, he
added.</P>
      <P>According to the Taipei Rapid Transit Corp. which operates the Maokong Gondola,
over 6.1 million passengers had ridden the system as of Oct. 1 since its
official inauguration on July 4, 2007.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ex-president Chen Shui-bian was indicted Friday on money laundering, corruption
and forgery charges involving nearly half a billion Taiwan dollars, becoming the
first former president in Taiwan's history to be put on trial for criminal
offenses.</P>
      <P>Instead  of seeking a specifically  defined sentence,  the prosecutors are
seeking the "harshest penalty" for Taiwan's former leader.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors from the Special Investigation Division under the Supreme
Prosecutors Office also formally charged Chen's wife Wu Shu-jen, his son Chen
Chih-chung and his daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching, and recommended they receive
"harsh penalties."</P>
      <P>In addition, prosecutors indicted 10 other individuals for their involvement in
the former first family's alleged corruption and money-laundering schemes.</P>
      <P>In a news conference called to announce the indictment, Chen Yun-nan, chief of
the division, said Chen Shui-bian's purported offenses were staggering and
allowed him to obtain ill-gotten gains on a scale "never seen before."</P>
      <P>His offenses were all the more objectionable because he had sworn to abide by
the lay in carrying out his duties as president, and therefore should be
punished to the full extent of the law, the leading prosecutor said.</P>
      <P>As to the ex-first lady, Chen Yun-nan said she deserves a harsh penalty for
using her status to interfere with her husband's administration's decisions in
exchange for personal profits.</P>
      <P>The ex-president's son and daughter-in-law, who are the holders of many of their
family's overseas bank accounts, should also be punished harshly for refusing to
reveal until now their overseas wealth.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors in charge of the investigation of the case suspect those bank
accounts were used to conceal some of their parents' ill-gotten assets.</P>
      <P>The indictment charged Chen Shui-bian and his wife of illegally receiving or
embezzling NT$490 million, including NT$204.15 million and US$8.73 million, some
of which was sent overseas.</P>
      <P>Of that total, the indictment reads, NT$104.15 million was embezzled from the
state affairs fund set aside for the president's discretionary use during his
eight years in office from 2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors charge that more than NT$27 million of that was obtained by using
inappropriate receipts to claim reimbursement from the fund, nearly double the
NT$14.8 million Wu was originally indicted for embezzling from the fund in 2006.</P>
      <P>The balance, or more than NT$76 million,  was claimed by Presidential Office
cashier Chen Chen-hui as "secret funds" from the state affairs fund and handed
over to Wu Shu-jen to pay for the family's daily living expenses and other uses,
the indictment alleges.</P>
      <P>The ex-first family allegedly received Another NT$100 million and US$6 million
in kickbacks from a total payoff of US$11.98 million by a development company
called "Dayu" to pave the way for the Hsinchu Science Park to buy a plot of land
held by Dayu in Taoyuan County at a price prosecutors believe was unreasonably
high.</P>
      <P>The balance of the bribe money was pocketed by James Lee, then-chief of the
Hsinchu Science Park, and Tsai Ming-jhe, who transferred the kickback to
accounts held by ex-first family members, prosecutors charged.</P>
      <P>The indictment accuses the former first family of collecting another US$2.73
million in bribes from contractor Kuo Chuan-ching to help him win a tender to
build the Nangang Exhibition Hall between 2002 and 2003.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors believe Kuo won the contract by bribing members of a panel organized
by the Ministry of Interior to assess the bidding after then-Interior Minister
Yu Cheng-hsien revealed the list of panel members to Kuo at the request of Wu
Shu-jen.</P>
      <P>Yu Cheng-hsien was separately indicted by the Taipei District Prosecutors Office
Friday for leaking secrets.</P>
      <P>As for the other 10 defendants, the prosecutor asked the court to hand down
lenient punishments or spare them because they have shown remorse and thoroughly
testified to their roles in the case.</P>
      <P>They  included  Wu  Shu-jen's  brother  Wu Ching-mao,  her sister-in-law Chen
Chun-ying, her university classmate Tsai Mei-li, and Tsai's brothers Tsai Ming-
jhe and Tsai Ming-jie.</P>
      <P>They were all charged with helping the ex-first family collect bribes and wire
them abroad.</P>
      <P>Also included were Chen Shui-bian's former aides, cashier Chen Chen-hui,
Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General Ma Yung-cheng, and the head of the
president's office Lin Teh-hsun.</P>
      <P>They were accused of helping the ex-first family illegally claim reimbursements
from the state affairs fund.</P>
      <P>Former Hsinchu Science Park chief Lee and businessman Kuo were also indicted for
helping the ex-first family solicit bribes and line their own pockets with a
portion of the revenues.</P>
      <P>Of the 14 defendants, only the former president is still being held in custody.</P>
      <P>The ex-first family's possible engagement in money laundering come to light
after the anti-money laundering group, The Egmont Group, alerted Taipei in late
2006 and early 2008 of millions of U.S. dollars stashed in overseas bank
accounts held by their family members.</P>
      <P>In one instance of the alleged intricate money laundering scheme, prosecutors
tracked Kuo's kickback to a bank account held by Tsai Ming-jhe in Hong Kong,
then to a Standard Bank account held by Wu Ching-mao in Singapore.</P>
      <P>The funds were then transferred to Huang Jui-ching's Merrill Lynch Bank account
in Switzerland and an account in RBS Coutts Bank in Switzerland held by Chen
Chih-chung under the name Galahad Management S.A.</P>
      <P>The former president admitted on August 14 that his wife had remitted more than
US$20 million overseas, but said the funds were surplus contributions to his
campaigns for Taipei City mayor in 1994 and 1998 and the presidency in 2000 and
2004.</P>
      <P>Friday's indictment may not be the last legal challenge the former first family
faces. Chen Shui-bian and his wife are still being probed for helping several
financial conglomerates acquire financial  holding  companies  in return  for
their "political contributions."</P>
      <P>Wu Shu-jen has already been indicted in 2006 for embezzling NT$14.8 million from
the state affairs fund and the trial is ongoing.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian was not charged at the time because he held presidential
immunity.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Coral survey suggests huge quakes may hit South Asia in next decades</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 12 (CNA)
12/12/08  20:54:53
(By Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An international survey of the coral reefs off Indonesia indicates that a series
of huge earthquakes are likely to hit South Asia in the coming decades, packing
destructive power similar to the magnitude 9.3 quake that triggered a
devastating tsunami in Southeast Asia in Dec. 2004.</P>
      <P>According to an article published in the latest issue of the weekly journal
Science, a research team composed of scientists from Indonesia, Taiwan, and the
United States studied seismic patterns over the past 700 years and hypothesized
the existence of an "earthquake supercycle" every 200 years.</P>
      <P>During the supercycle, a magnitude-8 quake would mark the beginning of a new
cycle, one or more magnitude-8 quakes would follow, and a super quake of about
magnitude 9 would end the cycle by consuming much of the tectonic energy
accumulated over the past two centuries.</P>
      <P>The magnitude-8.4 temblor of September 2007, they reported, is the "opening
salvo" in the 30-year period of each supercycle of quakes in the region when
seismic activity peaks.</P>
      <P>The researchers suggested that a quake with a magnitude of between 7 to 8 will
occur every six to 13 years, and a super quake of magnitude 9 will hit South
Asia in about 30 years.</P>
      <P>The study -- conducted by scientists from Indonesia, Taiwan, and the United
States -- derived their conclusions from an analysis of dead corals off
Sumatra's Mentawai Islands to get a better idea of how corals are affected by
earthquakes, especially those of magnitude 7 or above.</P>
      <P>The scientists explained that huge earthquakes in the past would lift the reefs
by one meter or more above the sea's surface and cause the massive die-off of
coral reefs.</P>
      <P>These dead corals left behind, much to the team's surprise, mineral structures
that explicitly recorded the time and scale of almost every large earthquake in
the area over the past 700 years.</P>
      <P>"Each incident triggered widespread coral deaths, but the long- lasting mineral
structures built by the colonies enable scientists to estimate  the dates of the
massive  quakes that caused those upheavals," said Aron J. Meltzner, a
participant from the California Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>The earthquakes "recorded" in coral structures occurred in 1374, 1596, 1675,
1797, 1833 and 2007.</P>
      <P>In the "coral records of earthquakes," the scientists discerned a pattern for
the earthquakes in the region, namely the supercycle theory. They used the
theory and the temblor of September 2007 to reach the conclusion that a new
supercycle has already begun.</P>
      <P>The Dec. 2004 earthquake was not considered in the study because its epicenter
was located 150 kilometers northwest of the northern tip of Sumatra Island and
had probably consumed much of the tectonic energy in its area.</P>
      <P>The study's area of investigation was much farther south off the Sumatra coast
and part of a different tectonic system, according to Shen Chuan-chou, a project
member from National Taiwan University.</P>
      <P>A separate study reported in the Dec. 4 Nature also suggested that the region's
2007 quake released only one-quarter of the energy that had accumulated since
1833, so the quakes in the region in the coming decades may be even larger than
expected.</P>
      <P>"If the supercycle theory proves true, the South Asian countries should stay
alert for possible huge earthquakes and step up their efforts to establish the
earthquake/tsunami early warning network, " Shen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ex-president's lawyers describe indictment as purge</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The indictment against former President Chen Shui-bian on corruption and money
laundering charges is inaccurate and basically a "purge of officials of the
previous administration, " Chen's lawyers said Friday.</P>
      <P>The lawyers, including Cheng Sheng-chu, Cheng Wen-lung, Lee Sheng-hsiung and Lee
Sheng-chen, made the remarks after Chen was indicted earlier in the day in
connection  with a series of corruption-related scandals involving himself and
family members.</P>
      <P>The charges were the first filed against Chen since his Nov.12 arrest and
detention. No other former Taiwan president has ever faced criminal prosecution.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors have recommended that the former president be given the harshest
sentence for his alleged illegalities involving nearly half a billion Taiwan
dollars.</P>
      <P>Indicted together with Chen were his wife, Wu Shu-jen, his son Chen Chih-chung,
his daughter-in-law, Huang Jui-ching, three of his former aides in the
Presidential Office, and seven other associates.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said the former president and his wife together embezzled  NT$104
million  (US$3.12  million)  from a special presidential fund during Chen's
presidency from 2000-2008.</P>
      <P>They also took bribes worth NT$100 million and US$6 million in connection with a
land procurement deal and another US$2.73 million in kickbacks to help a
contractor win the tender for a government construction project, prosecutors
charged.</P>
      <P>Cheng Sheng-chu said he was not surprised by the indictment of the former first
couple, but he insisted that all the charges against Chen Shui-bian and Wu Shu-
jen as well as the 12 other defendants are not factual.</P>
      <P>For one thing, Cheng said, prosecutors overlooked the fact that local
politicians tend to accept political contributions.</P>
      <P>"Prosecutors cast the Chen family's huge cash assets in a negative light and
then tried to seek evidence to back their conjecture.</P>
      <P>"In the process, they had to detain many potential suspects and enticed the
detainees to become witnesses for the state, " Cheng contended, adding that the
conjecture and evidence presented in the indictment are full of contradictions
and not solid.</P>
      <P>He also questioned the propriety of the presidential fund embezzlement charges
against Chen, arguing that the use of the fund belonged to the president's
administrative power, which should be free of interference by judicial
authorities.</P>
      <P>Another of Chen's lawyers, Cheng Wen-lung, said he felt a bit disappointed when
he read the indictment, which he described as "not well argued."</P>
      <P>Accusing prosecutors of squeezing testimony from detainees has infringed upon
the human rights of suspects.</P>
      <P>"The prosecution has failed to uphold the due process of law and justice," he
asserted.</P>

      <P>The brother-in-law of ex-President Chen Shui-bian apologized to the public
Friday for the social costs caused by his role in helping with the alleged money
laundering of the former first family.</P>
      <P>Wu made the apology in an interview with television reporters after the Special
Investigation Division (SID) of the Supreme Prosecutors  Office indicted 14
people upon conclusion of its investigation into the money laundering and
corruption cases that prosecutors charged netted the former first family NT$490
million (US$14.71 million) in illegal gains.</P>
      <P>Although Wu was one of the 14 defendants being prosecuted, the SID's indictment
recommended to the court that his sentence be reduced to the minimum in
consideration of the fact that he was fully cooperative during the
investigation.</P>
      <P>"I appreciate the Special Investigation Division's understanding, " Wu said. "I
was willing to cooperate fully with the prosecutors in their investigation, and
I regretted what I had done."</P>
      <P>Asked how he felt about the prosecution describing the conduct of his sister --
the former first lady Wu Shu-jen -- as a "serious violation of the law," he said
it will be up to the court to judge whether that is the case.</P>
      <P>In its indictment, the SID asked the court to mete out the "harshest" sentence
to the former president and "heavy" penalties for his wife, son and daughter-in-
law, while seeking commuted sentences for the other 10 defendants, including Wu
Ching-mao, because they were cooperative during the investigation.</P>
      <P>Wu was released on Nov. 28 on bail of NT$2 million after being detained for 53
days as prosecutors investigated allegations that he used his accounts in
Singapore to help his sister transfer US$20 million  to two bank  accounts  in
Switzerland  held  by her daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching.</P>
      <P>The investigation began after Swiss authorities suspected money laundering and
sought information about the account holder from Taiwan's judicial authorities.</P>
      <P>The SID later also obtained information from Singapore's judicial authorities,
tracing the money to an account at South Africa's Standard Bank in Singapore
owned by Wu Ching-mao, who received the money in several transactions from bank
accounts in Hong Kong held by the former first lady's college classmate Tsai
Mei-li and Tsai's two brothers.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's investigative authorities received a report from the international
anti-money laundering organization The Egmont Group in January  this  year
regarding  the Cayman  Islands'  financial intelligence unit's suspicions that
the former first family was laundering money through an account created under
the name of Chen's daughter-in-law at the Merrill Lynch Bank in Geneva,
Switzerland.</P>
      <P>However, instead of ordering an investigation into the suspected money
laundering, the then Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau Director-General
Yeh Sheng-mao showed the report to the then president -- the chief suspect who
should have been the target of the investigation.</P>
      <P>In early December, the Taipei District Court sentenced Yeh to 10 years in prison
after finding him guilty of corruption, of concealing a government file and of
leaking confidential information.</P>

      <P>The residence of Chang Hsueh-liang (1901-2001), who was a key figure in the
modern history of China, was formally opened to the public Friday, in the hope
that the historic site in the Wufeng township of Hsinchu County will attract
tourists, particularly those from China.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou cut the ribbons at the ceremony to unveil two bronze
statues of Chang and Chang's wife Chao I-ti. Also at the ceremony were members
of Chang's family, and Guo Junsheng, curator of a museum in Shenyiang,
northeastern China, dedicated to the Chang's son.</P>
      <P>Chang was placed under house arrest in Wufeng in northern Taiwan and held until
1990 for his role as the instigator of the Xian Incident that occurred in Xian
in the central China province of Shaanxi on Dec. 12, 1936.</P>
      <P>On that date, Chang kidnapped the leader of the Kuomintang (KMT) government
Chiang Kai-shek and held him hostage until Chiang agreed to form a united front
with the Communists of China against the Japanese.</P>
      <P>Chiang at the time held a non-aggressive position regarding Japan and considered
the Communists to be a greater danger to the government of the Republic of China
than the Japanese. His overall strategy, therefore, was to annihilate the
Communists before focusing his efforts on the Japanese. However, growing
nationalist anger against Japan made this position very unpopular, leading to
Chang's action against Chiang.</P>
      <P>The operation cost Chang his freedom, as he was placed under house arrest
shortly after the incident and was not freed even after the KMT government
relocated to Taiwan in 1949 when the Communists took control of the Chinese
mainland.</P>
      <P>In his address, Ma described Chang as a "quiet and silent" historic figure, who
even after he was freed in 1990 never publicly complained of being mistreated.</P>
      <P>The raw emotions of the feud have faded since the deaths of both Chang and
Chiang, Ma said, adding that his own efforts to foster reconciliation between
Taiwan and China also include seeking forgiveness.</P>
      <P>"I hope this historic site will attract tourists," he said.</P>

      <P>The Taitung County Police Bureau has borrowed an idea from abroad to help
overworked police officers relieve stress by encouraging them to smash
dinnerware at a training camp.</P>
      <P>Some of the officers who took part in the stress-relief program said Friday that
they felt great when they heard the ceramic plates breaking against a wall.</P>
      <P>"I felt like the pressure on me was gone," said one of the officers as he
recounted his experience.</P>
      <P>The police bureau collected 400 unwanted plates from restaurants in the county
for the program. Each officer was allowed to smash three plates.</P>
      <P>Pent-up officers could write down their complaints or the names of the bosses
they hated most on the plates before hurling the dinnerware as hard as they
could against a stone wall.</P>
      <P>According to another police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity, the
stress comes mainly from the constant demand for good work performance.</P>
      <P>He added that unscheduled stints, irregular work shifts and pressure from
elected county councilors also contribute to the stress on police officers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei Prosecutors Office on Friday indicted former Interior Minister Yu
Cheng-hsien, construction contractor Kuo Chuan-ching and seven scholars for
their involvement in irregularities related to the construction of the Taipei
World Trade Center's Nankang Exhibition Hall.</P>
      <P>The indictment asked that the court be lenient toward Yu and Kuo, but demanded
that the seven scholars be severely punished.</P>
      <P>The indictment charged that the seven -- Cheng Tsung-jung, Wang Lung-chang,
Chiang Cher-ming, Chou Chia-peng, Chen Po-ya, Kuo Yung-chieh and Wang Cheng-ying
-- who all teach at local universities, have "pursued their own interests in
lining their own pockets during the screening of the nation's major procurement
projects and had shown no remorse."</P>
      <P>According to the indictment, Kuo promised former first lady Wu Shu-jen he would
pay 2.5 percent of the total contract value as a kickback if he won the tender.</P>
      <P>Yu told prosecutors that Wu then asked him to release the names of the seven
scholars on the project's screening panel to Kuo, the chairman of Leader
Construction Co., so that Kuo could influence the panel and help his chances of
winning the tender.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior is required by law not to reveal the names of those
on the screening panel.</P>
      <P>With the list in hand, Kuo paid between NT$500,000 and NT$1 million to each of
the panel members to secure their support and ultimately was named as the
priority bidder on the project in January 2004 before winning the contract at a
price tag of NT$3.59 billion, the indictment charged.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors  asked for leniency toward the former interior minister after
determining that Kuo's kickbacks were paid to the former first lady and not to
Yu.</P>
      <P>They also asked for leniency for Kuo, who the indictment said confessed to his
acts of wrongdoing during the investigation and took the initiative to provide
related evidence to shed more light on the case.</P>
      <P>The Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutors Office earlier
Friday indicted former President Chen Shui-bian and his wife Wu Shu-jen for
illegal gains of NT$490 million from embezzling state funds and taking bribes in
two other scandals, including taking payoffs from Kuo related to the Nankang
Exhibition Hall project.</P>
      <P>Wu, during questioning by prosecutors Nov. 15, said the money she received from
Kuo was a political donation.</P>
      <P>The indictment said, however, that the US$2.73 million Kuo paid Wu was not an
ordinary political donation, noting Kuo's promise to pay 2.5 percent of the
total contract value as a kickback, and Kuo's offering of NT$6 million in
standard political donations on Nov. 19, 2003.</P>

responsibility for what former President Chen Shui-bian did during his years in
office between 2000 and May 2008, the opposition party's chief said Friday.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen made the remarks after Chen was indicted earlier in
the day on corruption and money laundering charges involving himself and family
members. No other former Taiwan president has ever faced criminal prosecution.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors have recommended that the former president be given the harshest
sentence for his alleged illegalities involving nearly half a billion Taiwan
dollars.</P>
      <P>Noting that Chen is an integral part of the DPP's history, Tsai said the party
will definitely assume political responsibility for his legacies.</P>
      <P>Terming Chen's indictment marks one of the most difficult moments in the party's
history, Tsai called on all DPP members to stand united in order not to let down
its supporters.</P>
      <P>Chen, who has been detained since Nov.12, twice served as DPP chairman, but quit
the party in August after publicly confessing to doing "what the law does not
permit" by wiring a sum of money abroad. He still retains a core of enthusiastic
pro-independence supporters.</P>
      <P>Some political analysts predicted that Chen will still affect the inner workings
of the DPP and may even split party members during the course of the trial.</P>
      <P>Tsai reminded party members that the DPP has a historic mission for Taiwan and
should therefore unite to help the party move beyond its predicament.</P>
      <P>Stressing that all DPP members are kind-hearted  and have integrity, Tsai said
she expects Chen to face up to his judicial challenge and mount a vigorous
defense against the corruption charges leveled against him.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, Tsai said, the DPP will work to defend Chen's judicial rights
and human rights. She demanded an immediate end to Chen's detention to pave the
way for the beginning of a fair trial of his cases.</P>
      <P>She dismissed as speculation media reports that the DPP will turn its  back  on
Chen  or regards  him as a liability  to the pro-independence cause both Chen
and the DPP espouse.</P>
      <P>Indicted together with Chen were his wife, Wu Shu-jen, his son Chen Chih-chung,
his daughter-in-law, Huang Jui-ching, three of his former aides in the
Presidential Office, and seven other associates.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said the former president and his wife together embezzled  NT$104
million  (US$3.12  million)  from a special presidential fund during Chen's
presidency from 2000-2008.</P>
      <P>They also took bribes worth NT$100 million and US$6 million in connection with a
land procurement deal and another US$2.73 million in kickbacks to help a
contractor win the tender for a government construction project, prosecutors
charged.</P>
      <P>Both Chen Shui-bian and Wu Shu-jen have denied any wrongdoing. Chen's lawyers
described the indictment as a "purge of officials of the previous
administration."</P>
      <P>Wu's lawyers also issued a statement on her behalf, saying that the indictment
was unacceptable as prosecution charges are aimed at demonizing the former first
lady, who has been confined to a wheelchair since she was hit by a truck in
1985.</P>

      <P>The leader of the unsuccessful 2006 campaign to depose then President Chen Shui-
bian declined on Friday to comment on the indictment of Chen and three members
of the former first family, whose integrity came into question publicly at the
time amid a series of corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>Shih Ming-teh,  who served as chairman  of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party between 1994 and 1996 before quitting the party in 2000, said in a brief
statement, "I have fought the good fight against corruption, and there is no
need for me to clean the battlefield."</P>
      <P>Shih was highly critical of Chen in mid-November after the former president
staged a hunger strike while being held in a detention center to prevent him
from collusion with other defendants and witnesses in the corruption cases
involving the former first family.</P>
      <P>Shih said that Chen "trampled on the dignity of the Taiwanese people and
betrayed their expectations."</P>
      <P>Shih issued the statement  after the Special Investigation Division under the
Supreme Prosecutors Office indicted Chen, seeking the "harshest" penalty for him
on charges of money laundering, corruption and forgery involving nearly half a
billion Taiwan dollars, and making him the first former president in Taiwan's
history to face trial for criminal offenses.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors also formally charged Chen's wife Wu Shu-jen, his son Chen Chih-
chung and his daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching, and sought "heavy penalties" for
them, while recommending commuted sentences for 10 other individuals for their
involvement in the former first family's  alleged corruption  and money-
laundering schemes.</P>

      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian was released without bail early Saturday after
being indicted Friday on corruption and money laundering charges.</P>
      <P>However, Chen is required to report any change in his residence after his
release and is also barred from leaving the country.</P>
      <P>Chen had been kept behind bar since Nov.12 as prosecutors prepared their case
against him.</P>
      <P>After four months of intensive investigations,  prosecutors indicted Chen Friday
on charges of corruption, forgery and money laundering. No other former Taiwan
president has ever faced criminal prosecution.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors also requested that Chen continue to be detained pending probes into
other criminal cases in which he may be implicated.</P>
      <P>A panel of three judges at the Taipei District Court rejected the prosecutors'
request after a more-than-three-hour hearing in which Chen adamantly insisted on
his innocence and eloquently debated with prosecutors.</P>
      <P>At the end of the day, judges agreed to Chen's release.</P>
      <P>Indicted together with Chen were his wife, Wu Shu-jen, his son Chen Chih-chung,
his daughter-in-law, Huang Jui-ching, three of his former aides in the
Presidential Office, and seven other associates.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said the former president and his wife together embezzled  NT$104

Presecutors also recommended severe penalties for Chen's wife, son and daughter-
in-law for their "unrepentant attitude" in the course of investigations.</P>
      <P>In contrast, prosecutors recommended that the 10 other defendants be given
lenient sentences or be exempted from any punishment as they have been
cooperative and helpful in the process of investigations.</P>
      <P>Both Chen Shui-bian and Wu Shu-jen have denied any wrongdoing. Chen's lawyers
described the indictment as a "purge of officials of the previous

order by enforcing those laws by punishments, you can also make the people keep
away from wrongdoing, but they will lose the sense of shame for wrongdoing. If,
on the other hand, in government you depend upon moral sentiment and maintain
order by encouraging education and good manners, the people will have a sense of
shame for wrongdoing and, moreover, will emulate what is good."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>President formally opens historic figure's residence to visitors</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The residence of Chang Hsueh-liang (1901-2001), who was a key figure in the
modern history of China, was formally opened to the public Friday, in the hope
that the historic site in the Wufeng township of Hsinchu County will attract
tourists, particularly those from China.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou cut the ribbons at the ceremony to unveil two bronze
statues of Chang and Chang's wife Chao I-ti. Also at the ceremony were members
of Chang's family, and Guo Junsheng, curator of a museum in Shenyiang,
northeastern China, dedicated to the Chang's son.</P>
      <P>Chang was placed under house arrest in Wufeng in northern Taiwan and held until
1990 for his role as the instigator of the Xian Incident that occurred in Xian
in the central China province of Shaanxi on Dec. 12, 1936.</P>
      <P>On that date, Chang kidnapped the leader of the Kuomintang (KMT) government
Chiang Kai-shek and held him hostage until Chiang agreed to form a united front
with the Communists of China against the Japanese.</P>
      <P>Chiang at the time held a non-aggressive position regarding Japan and considered
the Communists to be a greater danger to the government of the Republic of China
than the Japanese. His overall strategy, therefore, was to annihilate the
Communists before focusing his efforts on the Japanese. However, growing
nationalist anger against Japan made this position very unpopular, leading to
Chang's action against Chiang.</P>
      <P>The operation cost Chang his freedom, as he was placed under house arrest
shortly after the incident and was not freed even after the KMT government
relocated to Taiwan in 1949 when the Communists took control of the Chinese
mainland.</P>
      <P>In his address, Ma described Chang as a "quiet and silent" historic figure, who
even after he was freed in 1990 never publicly complained of being mistreated.</P>
      <P>The raw emotions of the feud have faded since the deaths of both Chang and
Chiang, Ma said, adding that his own efforts to foster reconciliation between
Taiwan and China also include seeking forgiveness.</P>
      <P>"I hope this historic site will attract tourists," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taitung County Police Bureau has borrowed an idea from abroad to help
overworked police officers relieve stress by encouraging them to smash
dinnerware at a training camp.</P>
      <P>Some of the officers who took part in the stress-relief program said Friday that
they felt great when they heard the ceramic plates breaking against a wall.</P>
      <P>"I felt like the pressure on me was gone," said one of the officers as he
recounted his experience.</P>
      <P>The police bureau collected 400 unwanted plates from restaurants in the county
for the program. Each officer was allowed to smash three plates.</P>
      <P>Pent-up officers could write down their complaints or the names of the bosses
they hated most on the plates before hurling the dinnerware as hard as they
could against a stone wall.</P>
      <P>According to another police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity, the
stress comes mainly from the constant demand for good work performance.</P>
      <P>He added that unscheduled stints, irregular work shifts and pressure from
elected county councilors also contribute to the stress on police officers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei Prosecutors Office on Friday indicted former Interior Minister Yu
Cheng-hsien, construction contractor Kuo Chuan-ching and seven scholars for
their involvement in irregularities related to the construction of the Taipei
World Trade Center's Nankang Exhibition Hall.</P>
      <P>The indictment asked that the court be lenient toward Yu and Kuo, but demanded
that the seven scholars be severely punished.</P>
      <P>The indictment charged that the seven -- Cheng Tsung-jung, Wang Lung-chang,
Chiang Cher-ming, Chou Chia-peng, Chen Po-ya, Kuo Yung-chieh and Wang Cheng-ying
-- who all teach at local universities, have "pursued their own interests in
lining their own pockets during the screening of the nation's major procurement
projects and had shown no remorse."</P>
      <P>According to the indictment, Kuo promised former first lady Wu Shu-jen he would
pay 2.5 percent of the total contract value as a kickback if he won the tender.</P>
      <P>Yu told prosecutors that Wu then asked him to release the names of the seven
scholars on the project's screening panel to Kuo, the chairman of Leader
Construction Co., so that Kuo could influence the panel and help his chances of
winning the tender.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior is required by law not to reveal the names of those
on the screening panel.</P>
      <P>With the list in hand, Kuo paid between NT$500,000 and NT$1 million to each of
the panel members to secure their support and ultimately was named as the
priority bidder on the project in January 2004 before winning the contract at a
price tag of NT$3.59 billion, the indictment charged.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors  asked for leniency toward the former interior minister after
determining that Kuo's kickbacks were paid to the former first lady and not to
Yu.</P>
      <P>They also asked for leniency for Kuo, who the indictment said confessed to his
acts of wrongdoing during the investigation and took the initiative to provide
related evidence to shed more light on the case.</P>
      <P>The Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutors Office earlier
Friday indicted former President Chen Shui-bian and his wife Wu Shu-jen for
illegal gains of NT$490 million from embezzling state funds and taking bribes in
two other scandals, including taking payoffs from Kuo related to the Nankang
Exhibition Hall project.</P>
      <P>Wu, during questioning by prosecutors Nov. 15, said the money she received from
Kuo was a political donation.</P>
      <P>The indictment said, however, that the US$2.73 million Kuo paid Wu was not an
ordinary political donation, noting Kuo's promise to pay 2.5 percent of the
total contract value as a kickback, and Kuo's offering of NT$6 million in
standard political donations on Nov. 19, 2003.</P>

described the indictment as a "purge of officials of the previous

      <P>Wu's lawyers also issued a statement on her behalf, saying that the indictment

fair and impartial, " a U.S. State Department official said Friday in response
to a reporter's question on U.S. opinion regarding the indictment earlier that
day of former Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Asked during a daily press briefing to comment on Chen's indictment on charges
of money laundering, corruption and forgery, State Department spokesman Sean
McCormack said that "this is a matter for Taiwan's legal system to resolve."</P>
      <P>"We are confident in Taiwan's democracy and its legal system. And we have every
expectation that the process will be transparent, fair and impartial," McCormack
said.</P>
      <P>He declined to comment on allegations by Chen and his supporters that the
prosecutors' investigation into his cases were marred by political interference.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, the prosecutors formally charged Chen and his wife, Wu Shu-
jen, with illegally receiving or embezzling NT$490 million (US$14.79 million) ,
some of which was wired into overseas bank accounts.</P>
      <P>Of that total, the indictment reads, NT$104.15 million was embezzled from the
"special state affairs fund" set aside for the president's discretionary use
during his eight years in office from 2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>The former first family allegedly received another NT$$299.85 million in
kickbacks from a total payoff of NT$399 million by a development company to pave
the way for the Hsinchu Science Park to buy a plot of land in Taoyuan County at
a price prosecutors believe was unreasonably high.</P>
      <P>The indictment also accuses the former first family of collecting another
NT$90.9 million in bribes from contractor Kuo Chuan-ching to help him win a
tender to build the Nangang Exhibition Hall between 2002 and 2003.</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife are also still being probed for helping several financial
conglomerates acquire financial holding companies in return for political
contributions.</P>

      <P>A delegation of U.S. military school students from the state of Delaware is
visiting Taiwan's Chung Cheng Armed Forces Preparatory School for educational
exchanges, Chung Cheng Commandant Hsia Yu-jen said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Hsia said seven student representatives of the Delaware Military Academy led by
Commandant Charles Baldwin and an instructor arrived at his school Dec. 4 and
will stay until Dec. 17.</P>
      <P>The visit is a result of a request Baldwin made to Taiwan's Ministry of National
Defense last year for the two schools to engage in education interactions, Hsia
said.</P>
      <P>In addition to learning about the school's training system, the Delaware
delegation is also taking classes in mandarin Chinese and calligraphy, as well
as lessons in playing the ocarina, a wind instrument that first became popular
in ancient Chinese civilization.</P>
      <P>The Delaware Military Academy, a publicly funded charter high school, cultivates
personnel for the U.S. naval forces. It was founded in 2003 and currently has
over 500 students in grades nine to twelve -- the equivalent of senior high
school in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Chung Cheng school prepares students for professions in the naval, air, and
military forces and has about 700 students at present.</P>
      <P>Hsia added he will sign an agreement with the U.S. school Tuesday to pave the
way for an exchange visit to Delaware next April.</P>

      <P>Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is likely to visit Taiwan in the first
half of 2009, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>If the visit takes place, it will make Abe the fourth former Japanese prime
minister to have visited Taiwan after Nobusuke Kishi, Takeo Fukuda and Yoshiro
Mori.</P>
      <P>The visit would also attest to the deepening of Taiwan-Japan relations, the MOFA
official said.</P>
      <P>According to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, Taiwan has been
inviting Abe to visit the country since he stepped down as prime minister in
September 2007, and the invitation has recently been accepted.</P>
      <P>Abe, who is now a member of parliament, originally planned to come during a
parliamentary recess in late 2008, but he was forced to postpone his plan
following an extension of the parliamentary session to deal with legislation in
reaction to the global financial crisis, the official said.</P>
      <P>The MOFA is now expecting his arrival in the first half of next year after the
next budget session of the Japanese parliament ends in April, he said.</P>
      <P>The plan, however, is not final, because if the House of Representatives is re-
elected in the first half of next year, Abe will need to campaign for his
Liberal Democratic Party, which would make him too busy to visit Taiwan, the
official noted.</P>
      <P>Abe was the 90th prime minister of Japan and held office from Sept. 26, 2006 to
Sept. 12, 2007.</P>
      <P>During his term, the Japanese government granted Taiwanese citizens visa-free
entry and the two sides mutually recognized each other's driver's licenses.</P>

      <P>The Lienchiang County Water Supply Plant on the outlying island of Matsu
announced Saturday that it will implement second-phase water conservation
measures from Tuesday for its Nankang area reservoir.</P>
      <P>According to the second-phase water conservation measures, water supplies will
be halted every fourth day, according to plant officials.</P>
      <P>The Nankang area received plentiful rainfall during the first half of this year,
but because water use increased significantly during the drier summer months,
water levels at the reservoir began to decline, the officials said.</P>
      <P>It was therefore  decided to implement  first-phase  water conservation measures
at the reservoir in August, under which water supplies were halted during the
nighttime hours.</P>
      <P>According to plant statistics,  the Nankang area reservoir contained less than
130,000 metric tons of water as of Friday.</P>
      <P>With water use averaging about 2,000 tons per day in the distribution area, the
reservoir therefore has only about 58 days of water supply left, the officials
noted, adding that residents served by the reservoir should do all they can to
limit their water use.</P>
      <P>Water levels at other reservoirs on the outlying island are currently normal,
and there are no concerns about water shortages in those areas in the short
term, the officials said.</P>

      <P>The statement said Switzerland began application for inclusion into the Schengen
Area in 1997 and has achieved this goal after a decade of efforts.</P>
      <P>Travelers wishing to visit Switzerland while in Europe will no longer need to
apply for a separate visa to enter the country, the statement noted, adding that
further details of the application procedure and requirements are available at
http://www.swiss.org.tw.</P>
      <P>The visa processing time is usually three days for short-term visas of up to 90
days, while visas of more than 90 days require six to eight weeks for
processing.</P>
      <P>The Schengen Area comprises most of the European Union member states, although
Switzerland is not a member of the EU. The area now includes Austria, Belgium,
Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary,
Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg,  Malta,  the Netherlands, Norway,
Poland,  Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.</P>

      <P>Relations across the Taiwan Strait turned a new page Saturday with four
agreements signed Nov. 4 by the two sides of the strait on the establishment of
direct transport and postal links and closer cooperation in food safety control
taking effect that day.</P>
      <P>The four agreements signed by the heads of Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) and Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS)
cover the expansion of existing weekend cross-strait direct chartered flights to
weekdays, as well as the establishment of direct shipping links, postal
exchanges and a cross-strait food safety mechanism.</P>
      <P>The accords were signed by SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and ARATS President Chen
Yunlin during Chen's historic visit to Taipei Nov. 3-7.</P>
      <P>The two sides agreed at the time that the four agreements would automatically go
into effect 40 days after their signing -- Dec. 13.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said in a statement issued late
Friday that the Ministry of Transport and Communications has already made the
necessary arrangements for the weekday charter flights, direct shipping links
and postal exchanges in accordance with the existing domestic regulations.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are quasi-official organizations responsible for handling
cross-strait engagements in the absence of official relations, while the MAC
oversees the SEF operations.</P>
      <P>The MAC statement also noted that the agreements took effect in full compliance
with the relevant provisions set forth in the Statute Governing Relations
Between the People of Taiwan and the Mainland China.</P>
      <P>An earlier meeting between Chiang and Chen six months ago in Beijing following
the May 20 inauguration of President Ma Ying-jeou of the Kuomintang -- seen as
having a more conciliatory approach toward China -- marked the beginning of a
thaw in cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Chen's visit to Taiwan made him the highest-ranking Chinese official to set foot
on Taiwan in nearly 60 years since the Chinese civil war of 1949.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Yang named world's top junior in year-end rankings</HEADLINE>

12/13/08  17:18:36

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Yang Tsung-hua became the country's first young tennis player to finish
the year as the world's top-ranked junior, but now faces the even bigger
challenge of converting that promise into a thriving pro career that has eluded
many other highly-ranked juniors.</P>
      <P>Yang clinched the spot after struggling past Matthew Kandath of the United
States 7-6 (5), 4-6, 6-2 in the first round of the Dunlop Orange Bowl in Key
Biscayne, Florida, Monday, making it impossible for Yang's closest pursuer
entered in the tournament, Indian Yuki Bhambri, to catch him.</P>
      <P>The 17-year-old, known for his powerful, though at times erratic first serve,
secured the top spot thanks to the International Tennis Federation's rankings
system for juniors that weighs both singles and doubles performances.</P>
      <P>Yang, who captured this year's French Open junior singles title, trailed
Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov and Australia's Bernard Tomic in the singles
rankings, but made up the gap with outstanding doubles results in partnership
with Taiwan's Hsieh Cheng-peng, including trophy-winning runs in the Australian
Open and Wimbledon junior doubles.</P>
      <P>When Dimitrov and Tomic decided not to play in the Orange Bowl tournament,
Yang's hold on the top-ranking was virtually assured.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese teenager was unable to overtake Dimitrov in the singles ranking,
however, after being ousted in the Orange Bowl's round of 16 Thursday by
American Alexander Domijan, 3-6, 6-4, 7-5.</P>
      <P>Yang actually had a match point in the third set but could not stop Domijan from
winning his 14th straight match on the ITF junior tennis circuit.</P>
      <P>The match was just another reminder to Yang that one's ranking in today's
fiercely competitive tennis world provides no guarantees for success.</P>
      <P>It's a lesson Taiwan's Lu Yen-hsun, who was ranked eighth in junior singles at
the end of 2000, and Wang Yeu-tzuoo, who finished 2001 ranked fifth, have
learned the hard way.</P>
      <P>Both have faced  considerable  obstacles  in sustaining  a professional career
at the highest level, including litanies of injuries and funding shortages.</P>
      <P>Also, for every Roger Federer (1998) , Andy Roddick (2000) and Richard Gasquet
(2002), who turned their top junior singles rankings at year's end into
outstanding pro careers, there have also been Arnaud di Pasquale (1997) ,
Kristian Pless (1999) , Gilles Muller (2001) and Donald Young (2005) who have
never fulfilled the promise of their top ranking.</P>
      <P>Yang, who plans to turn pro next year and is already ranked 550th on the ATP
Tour after playing in some lower level Futures events this year, will soon find
out if he can make the successful leap to the pros that has eluded so many
juniors.</P>

      <P>A visit to Japan by ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Wo Poh-hsiung has helped
dispel Japanese concerns over what the country's media have described as the
KMT's "China-tilted policies and anti-Japan sentiment, " KMT spokesman Lee
Chien-jung said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that Wu, who returned Saturday from a six-day visit, had meetings with
Japanese politicians, media heads and Taiwanese expatriate groups in Japan in
which he pointed out that President Ma Ying-jeou is well-versed in Japanese
affairs and that Ma considers Taiwan-Japan ties to be of great importance.</P>
      <P>Wu's meetings were successful in soothing Japan's misgivings about the KMT's
China policies since the new administration took office in May, and allowed
Japan to realize the importance of mutual goodwill between the two countries,
Lee went on.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Republic of China Representative to Japan John Feng also said Wu's
visit has helped boost cooperative efforts with Japan.</P>
      <P>In addition, KMT Legislator Lee Hung-chun, who visited Japan as part of Wu's
delegation, said the party chairman also expressed the country's hopes of
resuming bilateral negotiations on fishing rights around the disputed Tiaoyutai
Islands, over which Taiwan, Japan and China all claim sovereignty.</P>
      <P>He said various Japanese parliamentarians gave Wu their word that they will try
to facilitate such negotiations, and added that Wu's suggestion of pushing for
direct flights between Taipei's Songshan Airport and Tokyo was also well-
received by Japanese officials.</P>

      <P>Three more Chinese airlines will set up offices in Taiwan to prepare for
expanding cross-Taiwan Strait aviation services in the future, joining another
Chinese carrier that has already done so, an official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration has approved applications by Shanghai
Airlines, Air China and China Southern, the official said, adding that the
latter company has taken office space near the Taipei Songshan Airport.</P>
      <P>The other Chinese carrier, China Eastern, opened an office near the airport soon

July, while various Taiwanese carriers have also opened offices in China, the
official said.</P>
      <P>These offices cannot sell tickets but they can be upgraded into full branch
offices in the future to cope with an expected wider range of aviation services,
the official went on.</P>
      <P>The existing weekend direct charter flights will be expanded to a daily service
Dec. 15 as the result of an agreement signed between Taiwan and China Nov. 4.</P>
      <P>The expansion will increase the 36 direct flights currently operated between
Taiwan and China Friday to Monday to 108 per week, available every day.</P>
      <P>The number of destinations in China will also be increased from the current five

    <TEXT>
      <P>Results of a clinical trial on avian influenza vaccine in Taiwan show that
antibodies formed in over 90 percent of the trial subjects and that even if the
virus mutated, 45 percent of the vaccinated subjects would still be able to
resist the virus.</P>
      <P>The results were released at an academic conference held by the Taiwan Society
of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Saturday. The trial -- part of an Asia-
Pacific clinical trial on vaccine against the H5N1 strain of avian flu -- was
hosted by National Taiwan University College of Medicine Dean Yang Pan-chyr.  A
total of 400 healthy people aged between 18 and 60 took part in the clinical
trial that began at the beginning of 2007 at two local hospitals -- National
Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) and the Taipei Veterans General Hospital.</P>
      <P>Each trial subject was given two shots of H5N1 vaccine containing AS03 adjuvant,
with the second shot given three weeks after the first.</P>
      <P>NTUH Vice President Chang Shan-chwen said that while it is still not possible to
precisely predict how the H5N1 virus will mutate or whether it will develop into
a powerful viral strain that can spread from human to human, it is important to
know that the flu vaccine is effective in producing extensive and constant
immunity against different strains of H5N1.</P>
      <P>No cases of the virulent H5N1 virus have ever been reported in Taiwan, in either
animals or humans.</P>
      <P>The world's first recorded case of a human infected by H5N1 was in 2003. As of
Dec. 12 this year, 390 human cases have been recorded that have claimed the
lives of 246 people in 15 countries in Asia, Africa and Europe -- mainly poultry
workers who caught the disease from working in close proximity to livestock --
according to statistics compiled by the World Health Organization (WHO) . The
figures mark a mortality rate of over 60 percent.</P>
      <P>The WHO has recommended all countries should take precautions against a possible
worldwide avian flu outbreak, and has suggested using vaccine and anti-viral
medicine as two key strategies to reduce mortality during a major outbreak.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>National Chengchi University (NCCU) President Wu Se-hwa said Saturday that the
world today is much more closely intertwined than ever before and that he hopes
to use international academic exchanges to generate the future direction of
research in mass communications studies.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks at the opening ceremony of a two-day international
conference  titled "De-Westernizing  Communication Research: What is the Next
Step?" organized by NCCU and CNA.</P>
      <P>The conference invited international scholars in the area of mass communications
such as Professor  David Morley  of Goldsmiths University of London, Graham
Murdoch, reader in the Sociology of Culture at the Department  of Social
Sciences at Loughborough University, Professor Molefi Kete Asante of Temple
University in Philadelphia, Professor Kim Min-sun of the University of Hawaii,
Shelton Gunaratne, professor of mass communications emeritus from the Minnesota
State University, and Su Herng, professor and department chair of the Department
of Journalism  of National  Chengchi University.</P>
      <P>"This is the first time NCCU has invited international scholars in the area of
mass communication from various different cultural backgrounds to attend an
international conference, " said Wu, adding that "we hope to use international
academic exchanges to understand the issue of Eurocentrism in mass
communications studies so as to generate  the role of Asiacentricity  in the
future  of mass communications studies."</P>
      <P>Eurocentrism is the practice of viewing the world from a European perspective,
with an implied  belief,  either consciously  or subconsciously, in the pre-
eminence of European, and more generally, of Western culture. The term
Eurocentrism implies criticism of the concerns and values at the expense of non-
Europeans.</P>
      <P>CNA Board Chairman Huang Chao-sung pointed out that global media organizations
are facing a crisis of management and said possible solutions to the crisis is
to discover and nurture more professional media talent.</P>
      <P>"The study of mass communications  not only affects media management, " said
Huang. "It affects society, culture, politics and psychological aspects as a
whole. Therefore, we hope to initiate multi-element exchanges and research on
mass communications study."</P>
      <P>Other speakers at the conference touched on the issue of the dominance of
Western culture in mass communication studies, while a local speaker, Professor
Su of NCCU, spoke about the Taiwanese media.</P>
      <P>Su noted that a central criticism of many Taiwanese communication studies is
that they subscribe indiscriminately and significantly to theoretical models
mostly imported from the United States and Europe. "Researchers of communication
problems in Taiwan have not behaved independently and have so far failed to
build concepts rooted in the particular experience of life from their own
perspective," Su said.</P>
      <P>Established in 1927, NCCU is noted for its humanities and social sciences
disciplines.</P>

      <P>A new raft of shipping and air services pacts established between Taiwan and
China officially went into effect Saturday, setting the stage for the historic
Dec. 15 launch of direct shipping, air cargo charter and daily passenger charter
services across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Among the ships scheduled to take part in the inaugural direct sailing Monday
will be two vessels belonging to Evergreen Marine Corp. and Yang Ming Marine
Transport Corp., respectively, both named "Taiwan." One will embark from
Taiwan's Kaohsiung Port bound for China's port of Tianjin, while the other will
set said from Keelung, bound for Shanghai.</P>
      <P>The day will also see two Chinese vessels, each named "China, " put out from
Chinese ports to make the direct crossing across the Taiwan Strait to ports in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the first direct cross-strait cargo charter flight will be provided
by China Southern Airlines and is scheduled to take off at 3 p.m. from Guangzhou
for the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, according to Civil Aeronautics
Administration officials.</P>
      <P>The earliest daily passenger flights available that day will be provided by
Taiwan's TransAsia Airways and China's China Eastern Airlines and will take off
8 a.m. from Taipei for Shanghai and from Shanghai for Taoyuan, respectively.</P>
      <P>The shipping and air agreements were signed Nov. 4 in Taipei by Taipei-based
Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits President Chen Yunlin -- who
as the heads of the semi-official intermediary bodies serve as the top
negotiators representing either side -- upon the conclusion of their second
round of talks in five months since cross-strait dialogue was resumed in June.</P>
      <P>The shipping services agreement allows Taiwanese-owned  and Chinese-owned
vessels to sail directly across the Taiwan Strait, without having to make a
detour through Ishigaki Island in Japan's Okinawa Prefecture.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) has estimated that the
direct shipping will shorten the sailing time between Keelung and Shanghai to 17
hours, which is as much as nine hours faster than it is now.</P>
      <P>The voyage between Keelung and China's Fuzhou, meanwhile, will take only six
hours, representing a saving of up to 12 hours in sailing time.</P>
      <P>The services will also help reduce shipping  costs by 15 percent-30 percent,
according to the MOTC.</P>
      <P>At the same time,  the air services  pact addresses  the inauguration of direct
cargo charter services, with a total of 60 flights allowed to be operated per
month between Taoyuan and Kaohsiung on the Taiwan side and Shanghai and
Guangzhou in China.</P>
      <P>According to the CAA, the carriers that will operate the cargo charter services
are Taiwan's China Airlines and EVA Airways and China's China Cargo Airlines and
China Southern Airlines, which will between them provide 24 flights during the
first week.</P>
      <P>The air services agreement also concerns an expansion of the weekend charter
passenger services -- which have been operating between Friday and Monday since
July -- to every day of the week, with the number of flights provided rising
from 36 to 108 per week.</P>
      <P>The number of destinations in China will be expanded to 21, to include Chengdu,
Chongqing, Hangzhou, Dalian, Guilin, Shenzhen, Wuhan, Fuzhou, Qingdao, Changsha,
Haikou, Kunming, Xi'an, Shenyang, Tianjin and Zhengzhou. At present, the
services are available only in five Chinese cities -- Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou, Xiamen and Nanjing.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese and Chinese carriers will be allowed to fly to destinations in
northern China more directly and will no longer be required to make a detour
through Hong Kong air space.</P>
      <P>During the first week of the daily passenger services, the five Taiwanese
carriers and seven Chinese carriers operating the services will together provide
a total 101 flights, CAA officials said.</P>
      <P>The routes to be flown during this period will cover only 13 Chinese
destinations -- Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing,  Guangzhou, Xiamen, Hangzhou,
Shenzhen, Tianjin, Chongqing, Chengdu, Fuzhou, Haikou and Dalian, the officials
went on, adding that the four Taiwanese destinations covered will be Taoyuan,
Taipei, Kaohsiung and Taichung, the officials added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Fair Tax Reform Alliance, with support from 17 other civic groups, staged a
protest against the government's proposed tax reforms in Taipei Saturday,
drawing about 4,000 demonstrators.</P>
      <P>According to spokesman Chien Hsi-chieh, the alliance is against the proposed
reforms as it believes they will only benefit big business and the wealthy.</P>
      <P>Wang Jung-chang, the alliance's founder, said the reforms, if implemented, will
favor the rich but generate debts for future generations.</P>
      <P>The protest lasted about two hours, with protesters moving from the Liberty
Square at the Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial Hall complex and marching past the
Legislative Yuan building before ending their protest at Kategelan Boulevard in
front of the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The 17 civic groups that took part included the National Federation of Bank
Employees Unions, the Union of Bank SinoPac and the National Teachers'
Association, Chien said.</P>
      <P>He added that the protest was just a start and that the alliance will invite the
public to refuse to pay their taxes next April and May if the government does
not improve its tax policies.</P>
      <P>One specific appeal of the alliance is to oppose a government's plan to cut
inheritance and gift tax from 50 percent to 10 percent.</P>
      <P>According to the alliance, the cut will only profit the rich while shaving NT$20
billion (US$600 million) from the government coffers.</P>
      <P>It also took issue with the Ministry of Finance insistence that the proposed tax
cut would help attract investment to Taiwan and expressed doubt as to the
effectiveness of such a move.</P>
      <P>Chien also criticized the Tax Reform Committee, which was established in late
June to give objective and professional advice on the government's tax policy
making and reform proposals, as being a tool of President Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Chien was a consultant for the committee but dropped out last month after
deciding that the committee only serves the interests of big companies and the
rich.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Yiin Chii-ming said Saturday that the state-owned
Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) could lose NT$100 billion (US$3.01 billion) this
year and might continue to lose money next year due to rising prices of fuel
coal and natural gas.</P>
      <P>Yiin made the remarks while accompanying President Ma Ying-jeou on a visit to
the Dawulun Industrial Park in northern Taiwan's Keelung City where they met
with operators of small- and medium-sized enterprises, during which the
operators expressed their wish that electricity rates could be cut to help
stimulate the economy.</P>
      <P>Yiin pointed out, however, that Taiwan generates electricity mainly from natural
gas and coal, adding that although the world oil price has slumped, the prices
of coal and natural gas have continued to surge.</P>
      <P>He noted that the ministry had wanted to make a sharp upward adjustment to
electricity rates in July to reflect the rising costs, but ended up increasing
prices by only 25 percent of the required level and announcing a second
25-percent rise in October.</P>
      <P>He said that as Taipower has continued to absorb the rising costs of coal and
natural gas, it could lose NT$100 billion this year.</P>
      <P>"If the situation does not improve, then the losses next year could be between
NT$100 billion and NT$150 billion, " he told the businessmen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Christmas coming, but poinsettia sales decline due to economic slump</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 13 (CNA)
12/13/08  20:45:43
(By Emmanuelle Tzeng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With just two weeks until Christmas, many growers of poinsettias -- the festive
red and green pot plant that is an indispensable and ubiquitous Christmas
decoration -- said Saturday that they are feeling the impact of the global
economic slump and are having to try hard this year to maintain the turnover
they enjoyed last year.</P>
      <P>Poinsettia, or Christmas flower, whose formal name is Euphorbia pulcherrima, is
often used as an ornamental plant during the Christmas season due to the
brilliance of its vermilion leaves.</P>
      <P>A subtropical plant that originated in Mexico, poinsettia is cultivated mostly
in the north of Taiwan and looks its best from October to February.</P>
      <P>Even though poinsettias are indispensable for the Christmas period, flower
farmers said they still under heavy economic pressure, adding that both
production and demand are declining.</P>
      <P>Chuang Ying-cheng, owner of the Sanmin Garden located in the countryside of
Taoyuan County in northern Taiwan, told CNA that poinsettias  are also in short
supply due to adverse weather conditions earlier this year.</P>
      <P>He noted that frequent typhoons and high temperatures this summer caused a delay
in the plants' development of florescence in their leaves, making some of them
not red enough for sale.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, plant diseases earlier in the year have also reduced
harvests and reduced quality. He estimated that disease has led to a reduction
of about 100,000 pots of poinsettias around the country, bringing the total
harvest this year down to about 1.1 million pots.</P>
      <P>These factors, he went on, have meant that quantities can barely meet market
demand, even though the market demand seems to have declined slightly compared
to the past few years.</P>
      <P>Instead of raising prices to take advantage of the short supply, however, Chuang
said he has reduced the price of his poinsettias by NT$5 to NT$10 per pot due to
the economic slump.</P>
      <P>A poinsettia pot costs from NT$30 (US$0.9) to several hundred dollars in Taiwan,
depending on size and variety.</P>
      <P>"In general this year, we have recorded an approximate 10 percent reduction in
turnover compared to last year," Chuang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a seller at Chunghsing Garden, also located in Taoyuan County, said
the number of their orders recorded a decline of almost 30 percent this year.
Although retail sales quantities do not appear to have changed, wholesale
traders' orders have fallen, she said.</P>
      <P>To adapt to the economic slump, some farmers have been trying to maintain their
business with other activities to boost their incomes.</P>
      <P>The Hualu Flower Farm in Miaoli County, established in 1988, is a recreational
farm open to tourists throughout the year. Owner Chen Ji-neng said his business
has remained as stable as last year and that visitors are still willing to buy
his flowers, although he also offers other items such as carnivorous plants, as
well as activities such as camping and fruit-picking.</P>
      <P>He has created new varieties of dwarf poinsettias, as well as a three-color
poinsettia that bears red, pink and white leaves on the same stem.</P>
      <P>But according to Chen, it is the traditional red poinsettias with their big
vibrant leaves that give a joyful Christmassy atmosphere that are still the
favorite variety among local buyers.</P>

      <P>The government's tax reform plan is mainly aimed at boosting tax fairness,
formulating sound fiscal policies and improving public financial management, the
Ministry of Finance (MOF) said in a statement Saturday.</P>
      <P>The ministry issued the statement after tax reform activists staged a march
through downtown Taipei earlier in the day to protest an MOF-proposed tax reform
package which they said would only benefit big business groups and the super
rich while generating debts for future generations.</P>
      <P>Defending its reform package, which is now under legislative screening, the
ministry said local people's tax burden, at a rate of 14 percent of the
government's overall income, is lower than a majority of advanced countries
around the world.</P>
      <P>However, many people often complain about the heavy tax burden and unfairness in
taxation. Against this backdrop, the ministry said it has formed a Tax Reform
Committee in June to conduct an overall review of the existing tax system and
come up with reform proposals.</P>
      <P>Insisting that the reform package has taken into account tax fairness and
efficiency, the ministry said the newly proposed business income tax rate will
be applied to all industries.</P>
      <P>The tax rate adjustment will be implemented in connection with the expiration of
tax breaks for selected high-tech industries at the end of next year.</P>
      <P>By so doing, the ministry said, all industrial sectors, including various
traditional industries, will benefit from lowered business income taxes and will
better afford to invest in restructuring and technological upgrading to enhance
their competitiveness.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the ministry went on, the reform package also proposes
increases of four categories of income tax deductions to benefit all taxpayers.</P>
      <P>On the estate tax reform, the ministry said the reform package includes measures
to levy special sales tax on luxury goods and to overhaul existing land and
housing taxes with an aim to expand tax base and maintain tax fairness.</P>
      <P>As to the proposal to largely cut the inheritance and gift taxes, a bone of
contention, the ministry said reduction in inheritance and gift taxes is a
global trend.</P>
      <P>After Hong Kong and Singapore cancel such taxes, South Korea has also announced
a reform plan recently that would lead to a substantial cut into its inheritance
and gift taxes, the ministry said, adding that its plan to lower the inheritance
tax from the current 50 percent to 10 percent is in compliance with the general
world trend.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Financial squeeze exacerbates Taiwan's stray dog problem</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/14/08  02:09:46</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Factories have shut down, workers are being laid off and many people with jobs
are not expecting to get a bonus or raise, but people are not the only ones
affected by the ongoing financial tumult sweeping across Taiwan; the economic
downturn has also dealt a blow to the island's pets.</P>
      <P>A growing number of dogs are being abandoned in national parks, small lanes,
highways and even downtown Taipei in recent months -- worsening a problem that
was already a headache in this densely populated capital, according to animal
shelters and government agencies.</P>
      <P>"It has become more common to find stray dogs on the streets in recent days,"
said Huang Ching-jung, secretary-general of the Animal Protection Association of
the Republic of China, who also runs a veterinary hospital in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Big dog breeds, such as Huskies, Golden Retrievers and Labradors, are the main
victims in this recent wave of dog abandonment, shelter and government officials
said.</P>
      <P>Tallies compiled by Taipei City's Environmental  Protection Department, which is
responsible for handling stray dogs, show that the highest number of abandoned
canines were captured in the Shihlin and Beitou districts, adjacent to
Yangmingshan National Park, a recreation area in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The park has become a popular dumping ground because dog owners believe its vast
wooded environment is suitable for dogs to find food, take shelter and survive
on their own.</P>
      <P>Huang estimated that there are more than 300 or 400 stray dogs roaming within
the park at any given time.</P>
      <P>They survive on food and snacks left by visitors as well as small wild animals,
such as snakes and mice, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Those abandoned in the cities scavenge for kitchen scraps at dumpsters outside
the city's many restaurants.</P>
      <P>As the financial crisis lingers, fewer people are adopting dogs, further
exacerbating the stray dog problem.</P>
      <P>A dog adoption  program run by the ROC Animal Protection Association since 2003
has seen the number of dogs adopted from its shelter in Bali, Taipei County fall
from 45 in 2006, to 35 in 2007 and only 20 so far this year.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the ultimate goal of the association is to provide a good
environment and care for strays, Huang appealed to pet owners to treat their
animals like their family members and urged the public to adopt dogs and cats.</P>
      <P>"Rather than strays, they should be our good friends, " he said, because "we
want them to return to human society and become a popular companion for human
beings, " Huang said. "This is our greatest hopes for them."</P>
      <P>According to an association worker surnamed Wu who does not want her name to be
mentioned, most of the dogs sent to a shelter run by the association in Bali
were of cross breeds in the past.</P>
      <P>But since last year, almost all the breeds of dogs, including pricey dogs, began
showing up, she noted.</P>
      <P>This is an indication that even relatively well-to-do dog owners were finding it
too expensive to own dogs.</P>
      <P>According to pet shops, it costs at least NT$10,000 or more per month to raise a
dog of big breeds.</P>
      <P>Wu, a veteran animal rights advocate, believed that the selfish mindset of some
pet owners is a major root cause of the acute stray animal problem in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Many people fancying to have a dog like those depicted in movies might blindly
buy a pet dog, but throw them away rashly when they realize they do not enjoy
taking care of their pets, she said.</P>
      <P>The government recommends that pet owners implant a microchip in their pets and
have them spayed or neutered, but owners are not required to do so and many dog
owners do not follow the practice.</P>
      <P>"Only doing so will effectively reduce the number of stray or wild dogs and
cats," Wu said.</P>
      <P>The problem of dogs born to stray parents has also been a big headache for the
city's environmental protection authorities as it causes the population of
strays to multiply.</P>
      <P>Stray dogs sometimes chase and bite people, while others can cause traffic
accidents by not knowing how to cross the street. A continuously rising number
of abandoned dogs has also damaged Taipei city's image, with dog poo frequently
seen on the streets.</P>
      <P>The dogs abandoned  in parks have also harmed the parks' ecological system and
threatened visitors' safety.</P>
      <P>Once caught, abandoned dogs will be sent to animal shelters and some of them
will be eventually put to sleep if there is no way to trace their owners.</P>
      <P>Owners found to have intentionally abandoned their dogs could be fined up to
NT$75,000 (US$2,240), officials said.</P>
      <P>The problem is not limited to Taipei alone, as other areas are also reporting
dogs being deserted.</P>
      <P>A pet shop owner in Tsaotun township in Nantou County, central Taiwan said six
pet dogs have been dumped at his shop in just the last month. He said he is
afraid that a large wave of such abandoning will emerge during the upcoming
Chinese New Year in late January because money will be tight for many families
then.</P>
      <P>Besides pet shops, veterinary hospitals are also a common target for dog owners
who want to discard their dogs. According to pet shops and veterinary hospitals,
the number of pet owners who dump their pets at the shops has also been on a
sharp rise.</P>
      <P>Veterinary hospitals in central Taiwan have begun demanding animal owners pay a
NT$5,000 deposit in advance if they send their pets there for treatment.</P>
      <P>As the problem of strays grows, animal rights advocates urge the government to
allot more funding for shelters.</P>
      <P>Shelters -- the only refuge for stray dogs -- operate on thin budgets,  often
surviving only by individuals'  donations  and fundraising activities.</P>
      <P>Due to limited resources, some public shelters are entitled to put animals to
sleep within seven days if a dog or a cat has not been adopted upon their
arrivals, officials said. Others such as Huang's take care of the animals until
they die naturally, but space at those facilities are limited.</P>
      <P>Last year, 8,000 of the over 9,000 stray dogs housed at the Hsinwu animal
shelter in Taoyuan County were put to sleep, volunteer works said.</P>
      <P>Animal rights advocates said more also needs to be done by the government and
society to educate people about being responsible pet owners and to punish
people for abandoning their dogs.</P>
      <P>They said the process can start in pet shops, urging pet shop owners to not
simply be tempted by money, and to assess buyers and warn them about the
responsibilities of raising a dog, especially when the dogs grow to mature size.</P>
      <P>"But setting up more shelters to house the stray dogs or cats is by no means the
perfect solution to this problem," Wu stressed.</P>

      <P>Police announced Saturday the busting in offshore Penghu County of a cross-
Taiwan Strait human trafficking ring, saying that nine people have been arrested
for suspected involvement in the operations.</P>
      <P>Among the detained were four Chinese women who police said were smuggled to
Penghu off the southwestern Taiwan coast from Quanzhou in the southeastern
Chinese province of Fujian Friday via a fishing boat.</P>
      <P>Also arrested were a Chinese man,  who was allegedly the mastermind of the human
trafficking operations, and four of his Taiwanese accomplices.</P>
      <P>Police said the number of cross-strait human trafficking cases has increased
recently because the interview system for marriages between local and Chinese
citizens has become ever more stringent, which has helped deter cases of Chinese
women entering Taiwan for sex trade through marriage of convenience.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Reform aimed at boosting tax fairness: MOF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.13 (CNA)
12/14/08  10:42:56
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's tax reform plan is mainly aimed at boosting tax fairness,
formulating sound fiscal policies and improving public financial management, the
Ministry of Finance (MOF) said in a statement Saturday.</P>
      <P>The ministry issued the statement after tax reform activists staged a march
through downtown Taipei earlier in the day to protest an MOF-proposed tax reform
package which they said would only benefit big business groups and the super
rich while generating debts for future generations.</P>
      <P>Defending its reform package, which is now under legislative screening, the
ministry said local people's tax burden, at a rate of 14 percent of the
government's overall income, is lower than a majority of advanced countries
around the world.</P>
      <P>However, many people often complain about the heavy tax burden and unfairness in
taxation. Against this backdrop, the ministry said it has formed a Tax Reform
Committee in June to conduct an overall review of the existing tax system and
come up with reform proposals.</P>
      <P>Insisting that the reform package has taken into account tax fairness and
efficiency, the ministry said the newly proposed business income tax rate will
be applied to all industries.</P>
      <P>The tax rate adjustment will be implemented in connection with the expiration of
tax breaks for selected high-tech industries at the end of next year.</P>
      <P>By so doing, the ministry said, all industrial sectors, including various
traditional industries, will benefit from lowered business income taxes and will
better afford to invest in restructuring and technological upgrading to enhance
their competitiveness.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the ministry went on, the reform package also proposes
increases of four categories of income tax deductions to benefit all taxpayers.</P>
      <P>On the estate tax reform, the ministry said the reform package includes measures
to levy special sales tax on luxury goods and to overhaul existing land and
housing taxes with an aim to expand tax base and maintain tax fairness.</P>
      <P>As to the proposal to largely cut the inheritance and gift taxes, a bone of
contention, the ministry said reduction in inheritance and gift taxes is a
global trend.</P>
      <P>After Hong Kong and Singapore cancel such taxes, South Korea has also announced
a reform plan recently that would lead to a substantial cut into its inheritance
and gift taxes, the ministry said, adding that its plan to lower the inheritance
tax from the current 50 percent to 10 percent is in compliance with the general
world trend.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Honorary Chairman Lien Chan departed for China's
northern port city of Tianjin Sunday to witness the launch of direct shipping
links across the Taiwan Strait from the Chinese side.</P>
      <P>Lien and a 10-member KMT delegation were scheduled to travel via Hong Kong to
Tianjin Sunday, where the group will attend a ceremony the following day to mark
the opening on the Chinese side of direct cross-strait shipping links.</P>
      <P>Commercial vessels from both sides of the strait will begin historic direct
cross-strait voyages Monday, with Taiwan's ports of Kaohsiung, Keelung and
Taichung and 11 Chinese seaports, including Tianjin, Dalian, Qingdao and
Shanghai, being the key players in the initial stages.</P>
      <P>Among the ships scheduled to take part in the inaugural direct sailings Monday
will be two vessels belonging to Evergreen Marine Corp. and Yang Ming Marine
Transport Corp., respectively. One will embark from Kaohsiung bound for Tianjin,
while the other will set sail from Keelung bound for Shanghai.</P>
      <P>The day will also see two Chinese vessels put out from Tianjin and Shanghai,
respectively, to make the direct crossing to ports in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The launch of the direct cross-strait shipping links is one of four agreements
sealed by the two sides Nov. 4 on expanding transport exchanges, postal services
and establishing a food safety mechanism.</P>
      <P>After attending the ceremony in Tianjin, Lien and his delegation, including KMT
Vice Chairman Lin Feng-cheng, will proceed to Shanghai to attend the fourth
forum between  the KMT and its Chinese counterpart, the Communist Party of China
(CPC), that will take place Dec. 20-21 in Shanghai.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chinese tourist arrivals expected to double with daily charters</HEADLINE>

12/14/08  17:18:52

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of Chinese tourist arrivals to Taiwan is likely to double to 600 per
day following Monday's opening of direct daily charter flight services between
the two sides, according  to the  results  of research  by the Ministry  of
Transportation and Communication (MOTC).</P>
      <P>As more direct routes will be adopted for the daily cross-Taiwan Strait charter
flights from Dec. 15, passengers will be able to save on both cost and travel
time from that day, the MOTC said.</P>
      <P>The daily charter services will connect Taiwan to 21 Chinese destinations
scattered across China, including Chengdu, Chongqing, Hangzhou, Dalian,
Shenzhen, Tianjin, Kunming, Qingdao, Haikou and Shenyang.</P>
      <P>According to tour operators, the reduced travel time will be the greatest
advantage in the new measures.</P>
      <P>From Monday, a trip on the new Taipei-Shanghai route will take only 90 minutes
-- one hour less than the present route that has to go through the Hong Kong
flight information zone, tour operators said. This will also help reduce the
time of a flight between Taipei and Beijing to two hours and 50 minutes from the
present three hours and 35 minutes.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the number of the two-way charter flights per week will rise
from 36 to 108, bureau officials said. Currently, some 90 percent of the
passengers are Taiwanese businessmen, so seats will need to be added to meet
tourism demand between the two sides, they noted.</P>
      <P>The increased flights and destinations will also help attract a larger number of
Chinese tourists, they contended.</P>
      <P>The MOTC's Tourism Bureau forecast that an average of 600 Chinese tourists will
come to Taiwan for sightseeing per day aboard the direct flights, double the
current daily number of 300.</P>
      <P>Since the direct cross-strait charter flights on weekends have been implemented
from mid-July, a total of 32,973 tourists from China had visited Taiwan as of
early November, an average of some 300 per day, according to bureau statistics.</P>
      <P>Some 55 percent of the total, or 18,184 people, flew into Taiwan aboard weekend
charter flights from five Chinese cities -- Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing,
Guangzhou and Xiamen -- the tallies indicate.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China inked two landmark accords in June in Beijing to allow Chinese
tourists from 13 provinces and cities to visit Taiwan and to establish the
direct weekend charter flights.</P>
      <P>The two sides expanded the scope of the two pacts during talks in Taipei in
November, allowing Chinese residents from more cities and provinces to make
pleasure trips to Taiwan and expanding the weekend charter flights to a daily
service.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Four mountain climbing groups, including one composed of soldiers from an army
airborne division, gathered in central Taiwan Sunday to mark the restoration of
a flagship hiking trail between Hsitou and Alishan that has been blocked since
the devastating 921 Earthquake.</P>
      <P>About 100 people in four groups gathered at the Shanlinhsi Recreational Park in
Nantou County to mark their efforts to renovate the hiking trail between Hsitou
and Alishan -- known as the Hsi-Ah Trail --  which was damaged by the
devastating magnitude 7.3 earthquake that rattled Taiwan Sept. 21, 1999.</P>
      <P>Since the earthquake, which left more than 2,300 people dead, 8,800 injured and
some 10,000 others homeless, the renowned Hsi-Ah Trail was closed to hikers as
many sections of the trail were destroyed by the temblor.</P>
      <P>The 17-member special military squad departed from Alishan early Friday and
hiked along the route that roughly followed the old Hsi-Ah Trail, reaching
Shanlinhsi early Sunday. They trekked a total of 31 km, mostly along the
ridgelines of the mountains between Alishan and Hsitou.</P>
      <P>The captain of the squad, surnamed Chen, said the trek was a "synergy"
operation, as the soldiers completed long-haul march training and fact-finding
for the building of military communications relay stops, as well as enjoying a
trail famous among mountain climbers.</P>

      <P>The Singapore government has praised the cross-Taiwan Strait policies of
President Ma Ying-jeou, the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said in a press
release Saturday following a visit to Singapore by SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung.</P>
      <P>Chiang, who made a three-day visit to Singapore that ended Dec. 12, met
Singapore Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong and Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew and
exchanged  views on cross-strait  relations, cross-strait  development,  the
ruling Kuomintang's cross-strait policies, the results of a November meeting
between Chiang and his Chinese counterpart, Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) President Chen Yunlin, and Asia's regional security
issues.</P>
      <P>According to the SEF statement, the Singapore government and various scholars
said the continued building of mutual trust across the Taiwan Strait and the
promoting of cross-strait economic and cultural exchanges will help Taiwan gain
international space.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait ties began warming up with an earlier meeting between Chiang and
Chen six months ago in Beijing following Ma's May 20 inauguration -- seen as
having a more conciliatory approach toward China.</P>
      <P>A second round of SEF-ARATS talks was held in Taipei Nov. 3-7, in which Chiang
and Chen signed four agreements to allow expanded direct flights, as well as
shipping links and postal services, in addition to the establishment of a food
safety mechanism between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Chen was the highest-ranking Chinese official to have set foot on Taiwan since
the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.</P>
      <P>Lee, a former prime minister, is seen as one of the most influential political
figures in Southeast Asia, while Goh, also a former prime minister, is chairman

    <HEADLINE>Alishan mountain railway to celebrate 97th anniversary</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>One of Taiwan's most famous national treasures, the Alishan Forest Railway, will
celebrate its 97th anniversary Dec. 25 when the railway's operator, Hungtu
Alishan Development Co., reopens the line between Fenchihu and Alishan stations
after spending months repairing the damage caused by landslides during the
typhoon season.</P>
      <P>According to Hungtu Alishan executives, the repair work on the damaged sections
of the narrow-gauge railway was completed Nov. 25, and test runs over the past
two weeks have confirmed that the railway is safe to resume passenger services.</P>
      <P>A ceremony will be held at the Fenchihu train depot Dec. 25 to reopen the line
and to celebrate the 97th anniversary of the railway.</P>
      <P>The railway is said to be one of just three alpine railways remaining in
existence anywhere in the world. The other two are located in northern India,
connecting Himalayan mountains, and in the Andean mountain range of South
America.</P>
      <P>Unlike the national rail system administered by the Taiwan Railway
Administration, the Alishan Forest Railway was originally managed by the
Forestry Bureau under the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture</P>
      <P>Opened in 1912 while Taiwan was under Japanese rule, the main line of the
railway was built to haul timber down the mountain but is now mainly used to
transport the more-than 200,000 tourists who visit Alishan's 2,274 meter peak
every year.</P>
      <P>The scenic railway is 86 km in length. The main line, which is 72 km, runs from
the city of Chiayi in southern Taiwan at an elevation of 30 meters to the final
station of Alishan at 2,216 meters.</P>
      <P>The train stops at 17 stations and the whole journey takes about three hours and
20 minutes.</P>
      <P>The vegetation along the way changes from subtropical  to temperate before
giving way finally to alpine. The line features many switchbacks as it winds its
way up the mountain, crossing 72 bridges and passing through about 47 tunnels.</P>
      <P>In 2007, the railway underwent four months of repair work to remove massive
amounts of fallen rocks from successive landslides during the typhoon season.</P>
      <P>At the time, the government had been operating the train at an annual loss of
about NT$110 million (US$3.35 million) because it wanted to preserve the line
not only for its historic value but as a means to boost local tourism.</P>
      <P>In June this year, Hungtu Alishan, a subsidiary of Hungtu Construction  Co.,
won  a  NT$1.7  billion  (US$56  million) build-operate-transfer (BOT) project
to operate the railway for the next 30 years.</P>
      <P>Hungtu Alishan also won a contract to build a five-star hotel on 2.2 hectares of
state-owned land near Jhaoping Station, the last stop on the main line. The
development company also obtained the right to develop 0.9 hectares of land
surrounding Peimen Station in Chiayi City, for the construction of another
hotel.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taipei city government delegation of officials and animal keepers will depart
Monday for Chengdu in the southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan to arrange
for the delivery of two giant pandas offered by China as a gift to the Taiwanese
people.</P>
      <P>The delegation, to be headed by Yang Hsiao-tung, director of the city's
Department of Information and Tourism, will visit the giant panda habitat  in
the Wolong Nature Reserve  to discuss  the transportation of the two endangered
animals.</P>
      <P>"The arrival day and how the pandas will be transported will not be finalized
until we reach a consensus with our Chinese counterparts on what's best for the
pandas, " Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin told reporters Dec. 11</P>
      <P>Two Taipei Zoo technicians left for the Wolong wildlife sanctuary Dec. 12 to
familiarize themselves with the rare animals.</P>
      <P>China offered Taiwan the two pandas in 2005 when then-opposition Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan made an ice-breaking visit to Beijing. The Chinese
authorities also chose the names Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan for the pandas -- which
together mean "reunion" or "unification" in Chinese -- through an online vote.</P>
      <P>The offer, however, was turned down by the then-ruling Democratic Progressive
Party administration, suspicious that China would claim the shipment of the
pandas as a "domestic transfer" between zoos, which would mean Taiwan would have
admitted it was part of China had it accepted them.</P>
      <P>As giant pandas are a Grade-One endangered wildlife species subject to the
protection of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of
Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) , cross-border transfer of the animal must follow
strict CITES provisions.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture approved the import of the pandas after
President  Ma Ying-jeou,  who adopts a more conciliatory approach toward China,
took office in May and chose Taipei Zoo to house them.</P>
      <P>During a visit to Taipei last month by China's top point man on Taiwan,
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait President Chen Yunlin, both
sides announced that in addition to the two pandas, China will also present
Taiwan 17 dove tree seedlings -- a plant native to China known there as "green
panda, " in appreciation of Taiwan's aid and relief efforts after a devastating
earthquake in Sichuan in May.</P>
      <P>According to an agreement signed Nov. 6 by Chen and his Taiwanese counterpart,
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung, Taiwan will give
Beijing a pair of Formosan sika deer and a pair of Formosan serow in return for
the pandas.</P>
      <P>Introducing the pandas at the pact-signing ceremony, Chen did not mention the
names Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan, which local analysts said might mark an effort
by Beijing  to avoid  offending  local pro-independence activists.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the two pandas will be given new names after their arrival, Hau
said last week that the city government has no plans to do so.</P>
      <P>"At four years of age, the two animals have already reached full maturity. We
should respect their rights and refrain from changing the names by which they
have been called since shortly after their birth," Hau argued.</P>
      <P>Beijing has already issued an export permit for the transfer of the two pandas,
Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Liu Te-hsun said over the weekend, adding
that the animals are listed on the documents as being shipped from "Chengdu,
Sichuan" to "Taipei, Taiwan."</P>
      <P>According to Liu, filling in the export documents in this way is a common
practice when Taiwan imports protected wild herbal species from China. "The
precedent is being followed in the panda case, " he added.</P>
      <P>Although CITES requires identification of the "country of import" and "the
country of origin" on any export permit covering trade or cross-border movement
of Grade-One endangered species, both Taiwan and China refrain from demanding
having their national titles printed on the documents to avoid sovereignty
disputes.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan did not demand strict adherence to the CITES provisions  to
highlight  cross-Taiwan  Strait relations  as a "state-to-state" relationship,
an anonymous analyst said, China also did not use the term "Taipei, China" to
belittle Taiwan or underscore its sovereignty claim.</P>
      <P>"By so doing, the two sides have set yet another good example of shelving
disputes in favor of peaceful development of bilateral ties," the analyst added.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Zoo has created a Web site for Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan at http:
//www.zoo.gov.tw/panda/english/index.htm. Photographs of the two animals can be
seen on the site, which also includes an introduction on the concepts and
methods of animal protection.</P>
      <P>Zoo Director Jason Yeh said recently that the zoo has made enhancements to the
interior of the panda hall and that the keepers have conducted a dry run to make
sure there will be no hitches while they are caring for the two pandas.</P>
      <P>He further said that ensuring the welfare of the animals will be the top
priority when the animals are transported from Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport to the zoo after they arrive in Taiwan later this month.</P>
      <P>He added that the zoo will seek police assistance to try to shorten  the
transport  time from the airport to the zoo to approximately 40 minutes. Police
might be deployed to ensure smooth traffic flow to avoid having the pandas stuck
in traffic and to make the journey as least traumatic for them as possible, he
added.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan will also attend a similar ceremony at Keelung Port in
northern Taiwan, from where four Taiwanese commercial ships will depart for
Xiamen in Fujian Province, Shanghai and Taichang in Jiangsu Province and for
Dalian in Liaoning Province, respectively.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a vessel will put out from Taichung Port -- the third port selected
by the authorities to handle such crossings -- bound for Huangpu in Guangdong
Province.</P>
      <P>At the same time, China is opening 63 ports for cross-strait links from Dec. 15,
based on one of four agreements inked last month in Taipei by the two sides.</P>
      <P>Establishing direct cross-strait air and shipping links has been one of Ma's
major policies since he assumed office in May.</P>
      <P>Executives of Yangming Marine Transport Corp., another of the local shipping
companies involved in the new venture, said the measure will help shippers save
as much as US$60 million per year on costs, as well as greatly reducing journey
times.</P>
      <P>Keelung Harbor Bureau Director-General Hsiao Ding-hsun said Saturday that the
northern Taiwanese port and shipping companies will benefit from the long-
awaited opening of direct cross-strait shipping links.</P>

      <P>The Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutors Office will
hold a meeting Monday to decide whether to appeal former President Chen Shui-
bian's release following his indictment on charges of corruption and money
laundering, State Public Prosecutor-General Chen Tsung-ming said Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Tsung-ming, the prosecutors felt that in principle they should
file an appeal against the Taipei District Court's decision a day earlier to
release the former president without bail.</P>
      <P>He said that with Chen Shui-bian out of detention, some of the witnesses to be
questioned in the second stage of the investigation into his alleged taking of
bribes from the financial sector might be reluctant to testify.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors will make an announcement after reaching a decision at Monday's
meeting, he added.</P>
      <P>The former president had been detained for 32 days since Nov. 12 as prosecutors
prepared their case against him.</P>
      <P>After four months of intensive investigations,  prosecutors indicted him Dec. 12
on charges of embezzlement, bribe-taking and money laundering. He was released
the following day on his own recognizance after the court rejected a request by
the prosecutors to keep him in custody.</P>
      <P>According to the indictment, the former president and his wife together
embezzled  NT$104 million (US$3.12 million)  from the president's special
discretionary fund during his presidency from 2000-2008.</P>
      <P>They also took bribes worth NT$100 million and NT$200 million in connection with
a land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million in kickbacks to help a
contractor win the tender for a government construction project, prosecutors
charged.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors recommended that the former president be given the harshest
possible sentence for his alleged illegalities involving nearly half a billion
new Taiwan dollars.</P>
      <P>They also demanded severe penalties for his wife, son and daughter-in-law for
their "unrepentant attitude" in the course of investigations, while recommending
commuted sentences for 10 other defendants because they had been cooperative and
helpful in the process of the investigations.</P>

      <P>Eight people in a three-generation family who have worked as volunteers in the
northern county of Taoyuan were cited by Minister of the Interior Liao Liou-yi
Sunday for their unselfish services to others.</P>
      <P>The eight people, including 73-year-old Hsiao Ah-chi,  his 71-year-old wife You
Chu, their daughter, their son-in-law, and four of their grandchildren, were
cited by Liao at a ceremony held in the central city of Taichung.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, Liao described the volunteer workers around the country
as unsung heroes in their efforts to help the government serve the people and
make Taiwan a better place to live.</P>
      <P>He noted that it was tremendously hard for the volunteers to be elected a "model
volunteer family, " as very few families in Taiwan meet the criteria to be cited
at the annual event.</P>
      <P>Under the criteria, he went on, each member of the family should have been a
volunteer worker for over three years, at least two of the family members must
currently be volunteers, each of the volunteers should have worked over 1,000
voluntary hours and the total number of voluntary work time of the family must
exceed 3,000 hours.</P>
      <P>Both Hsiao and You have been working as volunteers at agencies under the Taoyuan
county government. Hsiao has been a volunteer worker for six years and six
months, with his voluntary work time totaling 3,114 hours, according to sponsors
of the citation event.</P>
      <P>You has been working even harder than her husband, with her voluntary work time
totaling an astonishing 10,852 hours, mostly at the Taoyuan County Library,
where she works as a cultural volunteer.</P>
      <P>Four of the Taoyuan couple's grandchildren -- the youngest of whom is just eight
years old -- have also been volunteer workers.</P>
      <P>"Volunteer work offers us an opportunity to pursue the pleasure of getting along
with people," said You.</P>

      <P>A call by the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) for the public to contribute ideas
on the best way to maximize the effects in stimulating the ailing econonmy of
the government's consumption vouchers has resulted in many ideas being
submitted, Interior Minister Liao Liou-yi said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Liao made the remarks while attending a ceremony to award volunteer workers in
Taichung City.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has now finalized the issue of the consumption coupons to be
a combination of six coupons with a face value of NT$500 (US$15) and three
coupons with a face-value of NT$200, for a total of nine coupons with a combined
value of NT$3,600.</P>
      <P>In addition to various value combinations, the ideas put forward by members of
the public included stamp- sized coupons and coupons that look like vouchers
issued by department stores, while others suggested having the vouchers on a
single sheet that would be stamped each time it was used.</P>
      <P>Liao did not disclose if anyone had actually won any of the various prizes
offered by the MOI for winning ideas, but he thanked the submitters for their
creativity.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile that day, the Government Information Office (GIO) announced that the
GIO will start a creativity contest Dec. 15 on how to maximize the economy-
stimulating effect of the coupons, with a grand prize of NT$100,000 for the
winner, whose name will be announced at the end of January. It also said there
will be runner-up prizes of NT$30,000 and NT$10,000.</P>
      <P>All the ideas, whether or not they are winners, will be placed into a database
that will be made available for business operators and shop owners, while the
GIO will also set up a Web site for business  operators  to advertise  their
discounts,  sales and promotional events.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shuan will brief the legislature Dec. 16 in an effort to
convince the lawmakers to approve the NT$85.7 special budget for the vouchers

      <P>A folding chair without screws designed by a teacher at Shu-Te University in
Kaohsiung County and his student has won a Red Dot Design Concept Award in the
competition for Germany's 2008 Red Dot Design Awards, considered "the Oscars of
the design world."</P>
      <P>Lecturer Chen Chun-tung and his student Fang Po-hsiung had spent three months
perfecting their design of the "Good-bye Screw" folding chair, which emerged one
of the winners in the furniture category from among 1,900 entries.</P>
      <P>Chen, who has designed 10 different kinds of chairs for an industrial company,
said Monday that it takes only one minute to assemble the folding chair, because
it has only a few components and no screws.</P>
      <P>He added that the company working with him has obtained the right to manufacture
the new product and will consider mass production at an appropriate time.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the chair is made of polypropylene mixed with textile fibers,
and treated with the gas injection technique. This technique can increase the
strength of the main body while reducing the plastic consumption, and results in
a cost reduction for the production.</P>
      <P>The new design has been put on display for one year at the Red Dot's second
museum in Singapore.</P>
      <P>The Red Dot Design Concept Award is regarded as the barometer for future design
directions and trends. It also offers many business opportunities for the award-
winning design ideas by attracting industrialists as potential partners.</P>

      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Honorary Chairman Lien Chan departed for China's
northern port city of Tianjin Sunday to witness the launch of direct shipping
links across the Taiwan Strait from the Chinese side.</P>
      <P>Lien and a 10-member KMT delegation were scheduled to travel via Hong Kong to
Tianjin Sunday, where the group will attend a ceremony the following day to mark
the opening on the Chinese side of direct cross-strait shipping links.</P>
      <P>Commercial vessels from both sides of the strait will begin historic direct
cross-strait voyages Monday, with Taiwan's ports of Kaohsiung, Keelung and
Taichung and 11 Chinese seaports, including Tianjin, Dalian, Qingdao and
Shanghai, being the key players in the initial stages.</P>
      <P>Among the ships scheduled to take part in the inaugural direct sailings Monday
will be two vessels belonging to Evergreen Marine Corp. and Yang Ming Marine
Transport Corp., respectively. One will embark from Kaohsiung bound for Tianjin,
while the other will set sail from Keelung bound for Shanghai.</P>
      <P>The day will also see two Chinese vessels put out from Tianjin and Shanghai,
respectively, to make the direct crossing to ports in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The launch of the direct cross-strait shipping links is one of four agreements
sealed by the two sides Nov. 4 on expanding transport exchanges, postal services
and establishing a food safety mechanism.</P>
      <P>After attending the ceremony in Tianjin, Lien and his delegation, including KMT
Vice Chairman Lin Feng-cheng, will proceed to Shanghai to attend the fourth
forum between  the KMT and its Chinese counterpart, the Communist Party of China
(CPC), that will take place Dec. 20-21 in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung is also expected to attend the forum, marking the

Economic, Trade and Cultural Forum, also known as the KMT-CPC Forum.</P>
      <P>According to KMT Deputy Secretary-General Chang Jung-kung, the forum is aimed at
promoting cross-strait economic, trade and cultural exchanges and cooperation,
as well as the stable development of cross-strait relations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of Chinese tourist arrivals to Taiwan is likely to double to 600 per
day following Monday's opening of direct daily charter flight services between
the two sides, according  to the  results  of research  by the Ministry  of
Transportation and Communication (MOTC).</P>
      <P>As more direct routes will be adopted for the daily cross-Taiwan Strait charter
flights from Dec. 15, passengers will be able to save on both cost and travel
time from that day, the MOTC said.</P>
      <P>The daily charter services will connect Taiwan to 21 Chinese destinations
scattered across China, including Chengdu, Chongqing, Hangzhou, Dalian,
Shenzhen, Tianjin, Kunming, Qingdao, Haikou and Shenyang.</P>
      <P>According to tour operators, the reduced travel time will be the greatest
advantage in the new measures.</P>
      <P>From Monday, a trip on the new Taipei-Shanghai route will take only 90 minutes
-- one hour less than the present route that has to go through the Hong Kong
flight information zone, tour operators said. This will also help reduce the
time of a flight between Taipei and Beijing to two hours and 50 minutes from the
present three hours and 35 minutes.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the number of the two-way charter flights per week will rise
from 36 to 108, bureau officials said. Currently, some 90 percent of the
passengers are Taiwanese businessmen, so seats will need to be added to meet
tourism demand between the two sides, they noted.</P>
      <P>The increased flights and destinations will also help attract a larger number of
Chinese tourists, they contended.</P>
      <P>The MOTC's Tourism Bureau forecast that an average of 600 Chinese tourists will
come to Taiwan for sightseeing per day aboard the direct flights, double the
current daily number of 300.</P>
      <P>Since the direct cross-strait charter flights on weekends have been implemented
from mid-July, a total of 32,973 tourists from China had visited Taiwan as of
early November, an average of some 300 per day, according to bureau statistics.</P>
      <P>Some 55 percent of the total, or 18,184 people, flew into Taiwan aboard weekend
charter flights from five Chinese cities -- Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing,
Guangzhou and Xiamen -- the tallies indicate.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China inked two landmark accords in June in Beijing to allow Chinese
tourists from 13 provinces and cities to visit Taiwan and to establish the
direct weekend charter flights.</P>
      <P>The two sides expanded the scope of the two pacts during talks in Taipei in
November, allowing Chinese residents from more cities and provinces to make
pleasure trips to Taiwan and expanding the weekend charter flights to a daily
service.</P>

      <P>Four mountain climbing groups, including one composed of soldiers from an army
airborne division, gathered in central Taiwan Sunday to mark the restoration of
a flagship hiking trail between Hsitou and Alishan that has been blocked since
the devastating 921 Earthquake.</P>
      <P>About 100 people in four groups gathered at the Shanlinhsi Recreational Park in
Nantou County to mark their efforts to renovate the hiking trail between Hsitou
and Alishan -- known as the Hsi-Ah Trail --  which was damaged by the
devastating magnitude 7.3 earthquake that rattled Taiwan Sept. 21, 1999.</P>
      <P>Since the earthquake, which left more than 2,300 people dead, 8,800 injured and
some 10,000 others homeless, the renowned Hsi-Ah Trail was closed to hikers as
many sections of the trail were destroyed by the temblor.</P>
      <P>The 17-member special military squad departed from Alishan early Friday and
hiked along the route that roughly followed the old Hsi-Ah Trail, reaching
Shanlinhsi early Sunday. They trekked a total of 31 km, mostly along the
ridgelines of the mountains between Alishan and Hsitou.</P>
      <P>The captain of the squad, surnamed Chen, said the trek was a "synergy"
operation, as the soldiers completed long-haul march training and fact-finding
for the building of military communications relay stops, as well as enjoying a
trail famous among mountain climbers.</P>

release Saturday following a visit to Singapore by SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung.</P>
      <P>Chiang, who made a three-day visit to Singapore that ended Dec. 12, met
Singapore Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong and Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew and
exchanged  views on cross-strait  relations, cross-strait  development,  the

between Chiang and his Chinese counterpart, Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) President Chen Yunlin, and Asia's regional security
issues.</P>
      <P>According to the SEF statement, the Singapore government and various scholars
said the continued building of mutual trust across the Taiwan Strait and the
promoting of cross-strait economic and cultural exchanges will help Taiwan gain

      <P>Cross-strait ties began warming up with an earlier meeting between Chiang and
Chen six months ago in Beijing following Ma's May 20 inauguration -- seen as

    <TEXT>
      <P>One of Taiwan's most famous national treasures, the Alishan Forest Railway, will
celebrate its 97th anniversary Dec. 25 when the railway's operator, Hungtu
Alishan Development Co., reopens the line between Fenchihu and Alishan stations
after spending months repairing the damage caused by landslides during the
typhoon season.</P>
      <P>According to Hungtu Alishan executives, the repair work on the damaged sections
of the narrow-gauge railway was completed Nov. 25, and test runs over the past
two weeks have confirmed that the railway is safe to resume passenger services.</P>
      <P>A ceremony will be held at the Fenchihu train depot Dec. 25 to reopen the line
and to celebrate the 97th anniversary of the railway.</P>
      <P>The railway is said to be one of just three alpine railways remaining in
existence anywhere in the world. The other two are located in northern India,
connecting Himalayan mountains, and in the Andean mountain range of South
America.</P>
      <P>Unlike the national rail system administered by the Taiwan Railway
Administration, the Alishan Forest Railway was originally managed by the
Forestry Bureau under the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture</P>
      <P>Opened in 1912 while Taiwan was under Japanese rule, the main line of the
railway was built to haul timber down the mountain but is now mainly used to
transport the more-than 200,000 tourists who visit Alishan's 2,274 meter peak
every year.</P>
      <P>The scenic railway is 86 km in length. The main line, which is 72 km, runs from
the city of Chiayi in southern Taiwan at an elevation of 30 meters to the final
station of Alishan at 2,216 meters.</P>
      <P>The train stops at 17 stations and the whole journey takes about three hours and
20 minutes.</P>
      <P>The vegetation along the way changes from subtropical  to temperate before
giving way finally to alpine. The line features many switchbacks as it winds its
way up the mountain, crossing 72 bridges and passing through about 47 tunnels.</P>
      <P>In 2007, the railway underwent four months of repair work to remove massive
amounts of fallen rocks from successive landslides during the typhoon season.</P>
      <P>At the time, the government had been operating the train at an annual loss of
about NT$110 million (US$3.35 million) because it wanted to preserve the line
not only for its historic value but as a means to boost local tourism.</P>
      <P>In June this year, Hungtu Alishan, a subsidiary of Hungtu Construction  Co.,
won  a  NT$1.7  billion  (US$56  million) build-operate-transfer (BOT) project
to operate the railway for the next 30 years.</P>
      <P>Hungtu Alishan also won a contract to build a five-star hotel on 2.2 hectares of
state-owned land near Jhaoping Station, the last stop on the main line. The
development company also obtained the right to develop 0.9 hectares of land
surrounding Peimen Station in Chiayi City, for the construction of another
hotel.</P>

      <P>Two Taipei Zoo technicians left for the Wolong wildlife sanctuary Dec. 12 to
familiarize themselves with the rare animals.</P>
      <P>China offered Taiwan the two pandas in 2005 when then-opposition Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan made an ice-breaking visit to Beijing. The Chinese
authorities also chose the names Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan for the pandas -- which
together mean "reunion" or "unification" in Chinese -- through an online vote.</P>
      <P>The offer, however, was turned down by the then-ruling Democratic Progressive
Party administration, suspicious that China would claim the shipment of the
pandas as a "domestic transfer" between zoos, which would mean Taiwan would have
admitted it was part of China had it accepted them.</P>
      <P>As giant pandas are a Grade-One endangered wildlife species subject to the
protection of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of
Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) , cross-border transfer of the animal must follow
strict CITES provisions.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture approved the import of the pandas after
President  Ma Ying-jeou,  who adopts a more conciliatory approach toward China,
took office in May and chose Taipei Zoo to house them.</P>
      <P>During a visit to Taipei last month by China's top point man on Taiwan,
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait President Chen Yunlin, both
sides announced that in addition to the two pandas, China will also present
Taiwan 17 dove tree seedlings -- a plant native to China known there as "green
panda, " in appreciation of Taiwan's aid and relief efforts after a devastating
earthquake in Sichuan in May.</P>
      <P>According to an agreement signed Nov. 6 by Chen and his Taiwanese counterpart,
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung, Taiwan will give
Beijing a pair of Formosan sika deer and a pair of Formosan serow in return for
the pandas.</P>
      <P>Introducing the pandas at the pact-signing ceremony, Chen did not mention the
names Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan, which local analysts said might mark an effort
by Beijing  to avoid  offending  local pro-independence activists.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the two pandas will be given new names after their arrival, Hau
said last week that the city government has no plans to do so.</P>
      <P>"At four years of age, the two animals have already reached full maturity. We
should respect their rights and refrain from changing the names by which they
have been called since shortly after their birth," Hau argued.</P>
      <P>Beijing has already issued an export permit for the transfer of the two pandas,
Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Liu Te-hsun said over the weekend, adding
that the animals are listed on the documents as being shipped from "Chengdu,
Sichuan" to "Taipei, Taiwan."</P>
      <P>According to Liu, filling in the export documents in this way is a common
practice when Taiwan imports protected wild herbal species from China. "The
precedent is being followed in the panda case, " he added.</P>
      <P>Although CITES requires identification of the "country of import" and "the
country of origin" on any export permit covering trade or cross-border movement
of Grade-One endangered species, both Taiwan and China refrain from demanding
having their national titles printed on the documents to avoid sovereignty
disputes.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan did not demand strict adherence to the CITES provisions  to
highlight  cross-Taiwan  Strait relations  as a "state-to-state" relationship,
an anonymous analyst said, China also did not use the term "Taipei, China" to
belittle Taiwan or underscore its sovereignty claim.</P>
      <P>"By so doing, the two sides have set yet another good example of shelving
disputes in favor of peaceful development of bilateral ties," the analyst added.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Zoo has created a Web site for Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan at http:
//www.zoo.gov.tw/panda/english/index.htm. Photographs of the two animals can be
seen on the site, which also includes an introduction on the concepts and
methods of animal protection.</P>
      <P>Zoo Director Jason Yeh said recently that the zoo has made enhancements to the
interior of the panda hall and that the keepers have conducted a dry run to make
sure there will be no hitches while they are caring for the two pandas.</P>
      <P>He further said that ensuring the welfare of the animals will be the top
priority when the animals are transported from Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport to the zoo after they arrive in Taiwan later this month.</P>
      <P>He added that the zoo will seek police assistance to try to shorten  the
transport  time from the airport to the zoo to approximately 40 minutes. Police
might be deployed to ensure smooth traffic flow to avoid having the pandas stuck
in traffic and to make the journey as least traumatic for them as possible, he
added.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will preside over a ceremony at Kaohsiung Port in
southern Taiwan Monday to mark the historic inauguration of direct cross-Taiwan
Strait shipping links.</P>
      <P>A vessel belonging to Evergreen Marine Corp. -- Taiwan's largest shipping
company and one of the world's biggest -- will sail from the Taiwan's largest
port to the port of Tianjin in northern China's Hebei Province -- the first-ever
between the two sides in 60 years.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan will also attend a similar ceremony at Keelung Port in
northern Taiwan, from where four Taiwanese commercial ships will depart for
Xiamen in Fujian Province, Shanghai and Taichang in Jiangsu Province and for
Dalian in Liaoning Province, respectively.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a vessel will put out from Taichung Port -- the third port selected
by the authorities to handle such crossings -- bound for Huangpu in Guangdong
Province.</P>
      <P>At the same time, China is opening 63 ports for cross-strait links from Dec. 15,
based on one of four agreements inked last month in Taipei by the two sides.</P>
      <P>Establishing direct cross-strait air and shipping links has been one of Ma's
major policies since he assumed office in May.</P>
      <P>Executives of Yangming Marine Transport Corp., another of the local shipping
companies involved in the new venture, said the measure will help shippers save
as much as US$60 million per year on costs, as well as greatly reducing journey
times.</P>
      <P>Keelung Harbor Bureau Director-General Hsiao Ding-hsun said Saturday that the
northern Taiwanese port and shipping companies will benefit from the long-
awaited opening of direct cross-strait shipping links.</P>

      <P>The Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutors Office will
hold a meeting Monday to decide whether to appeal former President Chen Shui-
bian's release following his indictment on charges of corruption and money
laundering, State Public Prosecutor-General Chen Tsung-ming said Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Tsung-ming, the prosecutors felt that in principle they should
file an appeal against the Taipei District Court's decision a day earlier to
release the former president without bail.</P>
      <P>He said that with Chen Shui-bian out of detention, some of the witnesses to be
questioned in the second stage of the investigation into his alleged taking of
bribes from the financial sector might be reluctant to testify.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors will make an announcement after reaching a decision at Monday's
meeting, he added.</P>
      <P>The former president had been detained for 32 days since Nov. 12 as prosecutors
prepared their case against him.</P>
      <P>After four months of intensive investigations,  prosecutors indicted him Dec. 12
on charges of embezzlement, bribe-taking and money laundering. He was released
the following day on his own recognizance after the court rejected a request by
the prosecutors to keep him in custody.</P>
      <P>According to the indictment, the former president and his wife together
embezzled  NT$104 million (US$3.12 million)  from the president's special
discretionary fund during his presidency from 2000-2008.</P>
      <P>They also took bribes worth NT$100 million and NT$200 million in connection with
a land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million in kickbacks to help a
contractor win the tender for a government construction project, prosecutors
charged.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors recommended that the former president be given the harshest
possible sentence for his alleged illegalities involving nearly half a billion
new Taiwan dollars.</P>
      <P>They also demanded severe penalties for his wife, son and daughter-in-law for
their "unrepentant attitude" in the course of investigations, while recommending
commuted sentences for 10 other defendants because they had been cooperative and
helpful in the process of the investigations.</P>

      <P>Eight people in a three-generation family who have worked as volunteers in the
northern county of Taoyuan were cited by Minister of the Interior Liao Liou-yi
Sunday for their unselfish services to others.</P>
      <P>The eight people, including 73-year-old Hsiao Ah-chi,  his 71-year-old wife You
Chu, their daughter, their son-in-law, and four of their grandchildren, were
cited by Liao at a ceremony held in the central city of Taichung.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, Liao described the volunteer workers around the country
as unsung heroes in their efforts to help the government serve the people and
make Taiwan a better place to live.</P>
      <P>He noted that it was tremendously hard for the volunteers to be elected a "model
volunteer family, " as very few families in Taiwan meet the criteria to be cited
at the annual event.</P>
      <P>Under the criteria, he went on, each member of the family should have been a
volunteer worker for over three years, at least two of the family members must
currently be volunteers, each of the volunteers should have worked over 1,000
voluntary hours and the total number of voluntary work time of the family must
exceed 3,000 hours.</P>
      <P>Both Hsiao and You have been working as volunteers at agencies under the Taoyuan
county government. Hsiao has been a volunteer worker for six years and six
months, with his voluntary work time totaling 3,114 hours, according to sponsors
of the citation event.</P>
      <P>You has been working even harder than her husband, with her voluntary work time
totaling an astonishing 10,852 hours, mostly at the Taoyuan County Library,
where she works as a cultural volunteer.</P>
      <P>Four of the Taoyuan couple's grandchildren -- the youngest of whom is just eight
years old -- have also been volunteer workers.</P>
      <P>"Volunteer work offers us an opportunity to pursue the pleasure of getting along
with people," said You.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A call by the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) for the public to contribute ideas
on the best way to maximize the effects in stimulating the ailing econonmy of
the government's consumption vouchers has resulted in many ideas being
submitted, Interior Minister Liao Liou-yi said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Liao made the remarks while attending a ceremony to award volunteer workers in
Taichung City.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has now finalized the issue of the consumption coupons to be
a combination of six coupons with a face value of NT$500 (US$15) and three
coupons with a face-value of NT$200, for a total of nine coupons with a combined
value of NT$3,600.</P>
      <P>In addition to various value combinations, the ideas put forward by members of
the public included stamp- sized coupons and coupons that look like vouchers
issued by department stores, while others suggested having the vouchers on a
single sheet that would be stamped each time it was used.</P>
      <P>Liao did not disclose if anyone had actually won any of the various prizes
offered by the MOI for winning ideas, but he thanked the submitters for their
creativity.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile that day, the Government Information Office (GIO) announced that the
GIO will start a creativity contest Dec. 15 on how to maximize the economy-
stimulating effect of the coupons, with a grand prize of NT$100,000 for the
winner, whose name will be announced at the end of January. It also said there
will be runner-up prizes of NT$30,000 and NT$10,000.</P>
      <P>All the ideas, whether or not they are winners, will be placed into a database
that will be made available for business operators and shop owners, while the
GIO will also set up a Web site for business  operators  to advertise  their
discounts,  sales and promotional events.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shuan will brief the legislature Dec. 16 in an effort to
convince the lawmakers to approve the NT$85.7 special budget for the vouchers

      <P>A folding chair without screws designed by a teacher at Shu-Te University in
Kaohsiung County and his student has won a Red Dot Design Concept Award in the
competition for Germany's 2008 Red Dot Design Awards, considered "the Oscars of
the design world."</P>
      <P>Lecturer Chen Chun-tung and his student Fang Po-hsiung had spent three months
perfecting their design of the "Good-bye Screw" folding chair, which emerged one
of the winners in the furniture category from among 1,900 entries.</P>
      <P>Chen, who has designed 10 different kinds of chairs for an industrial company,
said Monday that it takes only one minute to assemble the folding chair, because
it has only a few components and no screws.</P>
      <P>He added that the company working with him has obtained the right to manufacture
the new product and will consider mass production at an appropriate time.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the chair is made of polypropylene mixed with textile fibers,
and treated with the gas injection technique. This technique can increase the
strength of the main body while reducing the plastic consumption, and results in
a cost reduction for the production.</P>
      <P>The new design has been put on display for one year at the Red Dot's second

    <HEADLINE>President presides over opening of direct cross-strait shipping links</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Dec. 15 (CNA)
12/15/08  12:49:30
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou traveled to the southern port city of Kaohsiung Monday to
officiate at a ceremony that marked the historic inauguration of direct cross-
Taiwan Strait shipping links.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, Ma said he has mixed feelings about the establishment
of the links as he had published a white paper on direct cross-strait air and
shipping links 16 years ago when he was vice chairman of the Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council and when the two sides were technically at war.</P>
      <P>The president said he is pleased that direct air and shipping transport links
across the Taiwan Strait have been launched only six months and 15 days since
his inauguration, as a result of efforts by the administrations on both sides.</P>
      <P>"The opening of direct air and shipping links means the two sides are no longer
hostile toward each other and are willing to replace confrontation with dialogue
and conflict with reconciliation, " he said.</P>
      <P>The direct cross-strait shipping links officially got underway at 10 a.m.  at
the Kaohsiung  Harbor,  with  the Uni-Adroit,  a full-container ship owned and
operated by Taiwan's Evergreen Marine Corp, setting sail for China's northern
port city of Tianjin.</P>
      <P>The Uni-Adroit, with a capacity of 1,168 TEUs, was scheduled to sail directly
from Kaohsiung to Tianjin's New Port before heading to the northern Chinese
ports Dalian and Qingdao on its way home, according to an Evergreen spokesman.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, four container ships owned and operated by Taiwan's Wan Hai Lines,
Yang Ming Marine Transport Corp., Taiwan Navigation Co. and China's Huarong
Marine Co., respectively, were also scheduled to depart Monday from Taiwan's
northern port of Keelung for various Chinese seaports, including Shanghai and
Dalien.</P>
      <P>Also on Monday, 15 Chinese vessels were scheduled to set sail from six Chinese
seaports, including Tianjin and Shanghai, to make the direct crossing to
Taiwan's Kaohsiung, Keelung and Taichung harbors.</P>
      <P>The launch of direct cross-strait shipping links is one of four agreements
sealed by the two sides of the Taiwan Strait on Nov. 4 to further expand
transportation exchanges, postal services and address food safety issues.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Dismissing the disapproval expressed by some critics of the latest cross-Taiwan
Strait opening, Taiwan's top China policy coordinator said Monday that the
launch of direct shipping and expanded air transport links across the Taiwan
Strait does not mean that Taiwan is now tilting toward China.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said the inauguration of
direct cross-strait shipping links and the launch of expanded cross-strait air
links Monday are by no means symbolic of Taiwan "paying tribute to the Chinese
leaders" as some have alleged.</P>
      <P>Instead, she said, the opening of the links was one of the administration's
policies to create an environment that would be conducive to the Taiwan people
making commercial profits.</P>
      <P>With the opening of direct cross-strait shipping links, she said, Taiwan-based
shipping companies and related businesses would see huge cuts in costs and
transport time, which in turn would help to bolster Taiwan's international
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, she noted that negotiators from both sides have agreed that the
Taiwanese and Chinese vessels plying the routes would fly their respective
national flags while they are in their own country, but the flags would be
removed when they enter the territory of the other side.</P>
      <P>The launch of direct cross-strait shipping links is one of four agreements
sealed by the two sides Nov. 4 on expanding transport exchanges, postal services
and establishing a food safety mechanism.</P>
      <P>The private sector estimates that the establishment of two-way direct transport
links would save Taiwan up to US$90 million per year in direct flights and
shipping costs.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Direct shipping links between Taiwan and mainland China were officially launched
Monday morning with formal ceremonies at Keelung harbor in northern Taiwan and
Kaohsiung harbor in southern Taiwan, at which Premier Liu Chao-shiuan and
President Ma Ying-jeou officiated, respectively.</P>
      <P>I am very happy to see that a new page has been turned in shipping links between
Taiwan and mainland China, " said Liu at the launch ceremony at Keelung Harbor.</P>
      <P>"This is an important step in cross-strait transportation. We have worked for
several years to make this happen, " he said. "I am happy to see this progress,
but I am sad that it took us so long to complete this step."</P>
      <P>With the establishment of direct shipping links, cargo transport between
mainland China and Taiwan will increase, as such links will allow for lower
shipping costs and quicker delivery of goods between the two sides, he said.</P>
      <P>A 20,000-ton cargo ship will save around NT$200,000 per trip from Keelung to any
port in Fujian province he said.</P>
      <P>For passengers, if you board a vessel at 8 p.m. then go to sleep, when you wake
up, you will be in mainland China," said Liu.</P>
      <P>"The service, in a sense, will be better than express delivery, he added.</P>
      <P>He expressed the view that Taiwan products, especially fruit, will be very
popular in mainland China, noting that it will now cost less to transport farm
produce to China because of the shipping links.</P>
      <P>He urged that everyone strive to boost the local economy, noting that the
opening of direct cross-strait shipping links was one President Ma Ying-jeou's
major election promises.</P>
      <P>"Today, fully-loaded cargo vessels are sailing to mainland Chinese ports, which
makes Keelung Harbor a shining star in northern Taiwan, "he said.</P>
      <P>With the launch of the direct shipping links, commercial vessels will ply sea
routes between the two sides, with Kaohsiung, Keelung and Taichung in Taiwan and
11 seaports in China, including Tianjin, Dalian, Qingdao and Shanghai, being the
key ports in the initial stages.</P>
      <P>The "Ming Chun" cargo ship of the Wanhai Lines, "YM Heights" belonging to Yang
Ming Marine Transport Corp., the container vessel "Tao Yuan" belonging to the
Taiwan Navigation Company and the cargo ship "Kang Ping" which belongs to the
Huarong Marine Shipping Co. were all set to sail from Keelung Harbor Monday.</P>
      <P>The "YM Heights" was bound for Shanghai, while the other three were headed for
other ports in mainland China.</P>
      <P>The crews of the four vessels stood on deck after they finished loading the
cargo waiting for the historic formal launching of the links.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, two mainland Chinese vessels were scheduled to embark for Taiwan from
Tianjin and Shanghai, respectively, to make the direct crossing of the Taiwan
Strait to ports in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The launch of the direct cross-strait shipping links was effected under one of
four agreements sealed by the two sides Nov. 4 on expanding transport exchanges

      <P>A total of 2,400 employees were laid off by companies in the Hsinchu Science
Park in the first 11 months of this year, a park administration official said
Monday.</P>
      <P>The figure represents a year-on-year increase of 70 percent when compared to the
one posted for the same period of 2007, but is about the same level as the 2006
figure for the first 11 months -- before the effects of the global financial
meltdown became apparent -- said Tu Chi-hsiang, deputy director-general of the
Hsinchu Science Park Administration.</P>
      <P>Tu called for the management of firms in the park to keep in mind that an
excellent workforce is the bedrock of any business seeking long-term sustainable
development.</P>
      <P>The Hsinchu Science Park, located in northern Taiwan, is known as the country's
"Silicon Valley, " as it was the first science-based industrial park to be

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng expressed hope Monday that Asia-Pacific
countries will voice support for Taiwan's bid for observer status at the World
Health Assembly -- the decision-making arm of the World Health Organization
(WHO) -- to be held next May.</P>
      <P>In his opening remarks at the International Conference on East Asia Regional
Development held in Taipei,  Wang said Taiwan's influence on and contributions
to the world make the country's bids for participation in international
organizations such as the WHO deserving of support from nations in the Asia-
Pacific region.</P>
      <P>In addition, he went on, through the overseas visits he has made in the past, he
has come to realize that strengthening the country's foreign relations is key to
achieving  political and economic stability at home.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the country should make every effort to involve itself in Asia-
Pacific affairs, especially at present, when the region is faced with challenges
and changes, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Apart from the development of friendly relations with regional neighbors, he
pointed out that whether cross-Taiwan Strait links will improve effectively also
plays a pivotal role in Taiwan's continued prosperity.</P>
      <P>In the past, Taiwan's efforts to obtain WHO membership have always been stymied
by China, and while there has so far been no clear indication regarding what its
attitude is likely to be next May, the Beijing authorities have not ruled out
the possibility of negotiations on Taiwan's participation in the world body.</P>
      <P>Wang said that during a landmark visit to Taiwan in early November by Chen
Yunlin, president of China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits, he proposed to Chen that China could withdraw its more-than 1,000
missiles targeting the country and cease to obstruct Taiwan's participation in
international bodies.</P>
      <P>Peaceful cross-strait development, he continued, will in turn ensure stability
in East Asia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chinese spouses welcome direct flights, but want lower airfare</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 15 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese spouses married to Taiwanese people on Monday overwhelmingly welcomed
the launching of daily direct flights between Taiwan and China, expressing hopes
it will make it easier for them to travel back and forth between the two sides.</P>
      <P>I believe it will save time and be more convenient, " said Zeng Yen-mei, who
originated from east China's Jiangxi province, and has been in Taiwan for more
than 10 years.</P>
      <P>In the past, it took her about 10 hours to travel from Taipei to Jiangxi to see
relatives, due to a mandatory stopover in Hong Kong, or Macau. With direct
flights, the travel time has been reduced.</P>
      <P>In addition to Taiwanese investors, the estimated 290,000 Chinese spouses,
mostly wives, in Taiwan are believed to be one of the main beneficiaries of the
new ease of transportation.</P>
      <P>Until recently, many of the spouses could not easily work here until after
living in Taiwan for several years, due to government restrictions. That and the
costly detoured flights made it difficult for them to visit parents and other
family members back in China. Many visit only once a year during Chinese New
Year, or not every year.</P>
      <P>Spouses on Monday, however, said they will not jump at the chance of taking the
direct flights, as airfares are still expensive.</P>
      <P>"I hope that the ticket price would come down to NT$15,000,said Wu Feng-hua, who
came from Sichuan province, adding that the current price is around NT$20,000
for a roundtrip ticket.</P>
      <P>Wu said the resumption of direct daily flights after a nearly 60 year hiatus
following a Chinese civil war makes her more willing to go back to China to
visit her family there. She currently visits no more than once a year.</P>
      <P>In addition to allowing flights to fly directly, the number of destinations  in
China have also been significantly  expanded, including Chengdu in Wu's home
province of Sichuan and nearby Chongqing in southwest China.</P>
      <P>As a result, Wu's journeys home will be significantly shortened.</P>
      <P>As part of landmark agreements signed in early November by the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait, which went into effect Monday, new direct and regular air
services are opened among eight Taiwan cities and 21 of Chinas.</P>
      <P>As the planes no longer need to fly south through Hong Kong's air space, the
flight time between Taipei and Shanghai is cut by an hour, becoming 80 minutes.
It will take only 150 minutes from Taipei to Beijing, making it possible for
businessman and others to travel back and forth between the two sides in one
day.</P>
      <P>It is believed that the reopening of cross-strait air links will help boost
Taiwans tourism, with the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
expecting the number of Chinese tourists coming to Taiwan to rise to about 600 a
day, up from the current 300.</P>
      <P>Lower airfares and more departure points from China could enable more of the
mainland spouses' relatives to visit Taiwan. Other than parents and siblings,
some of the spouses have children from previous marriages whom they long to see.</P>
      <P>The direct flights,  as well as direct shipping and mail deliveries launched
Monday between Taiwan and China are the first to happen since the end of a civil
war in 1949 when the Communist Party seized power on the Chinese mainland and
the Nationalist Party or Kuomintang fled to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Mainland spouses represent the largest group of foreign spouses in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New evidence proves brown dwarfs form like stars</HEADLINE>

12/15/08  18:18:23
(By Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan-U.S. astronomical research project has discovered the first ever direct
evidence that brown dwarfs form in the same way as stars, a finding that may
settle the argument on whether brown dwarfs form like stars or like planets.</P>
      <P>According to Academia Sinica, a brown dwarf is an astronomical object with a
mass larger than a planet but smaller than a star -- generally 15 to 75 times
larger than Jupiter.</P>
      <P>The paper, which will be published in the Dec. 20 issue of the Astrophysical
Journal Letters, stated that a brown dwarf dubbed "ISO- Oph 102" was observed
developing an accretion disk and two outflow jets in opposite directions --  the
unique phenomena of star formation.</P>
      <P>However, it is not clear whether brown dwarfs -- sometimes called "failed stars"
-- form like stars, from the gravitational collapse of gas clouds, or form like
planets, agglomerating rocky material until they grow massive enough to draw in
nearby gas.</P>
      <P>Another surprising aspect of the scientists' findings is that the observation
was made with an older generation telescope,  the Submillimeter Array -- a
collaborative project of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in the United
States and Academia Sinica in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"As brown dwarfs tend to have smaller mass and weaker outflows, we thought only
a next-generation telescope like ALMA could make the observation," said Phan
Bao-ngoc, a visiting scholar at the Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics of
Academia Sinica.</P>
      <P>Compared to the outflow from a typical star, the ISO-Oph 102's outflow contains
1,000 times less mass and the outflow rate is also one-hundredth that of star,
the scientists reported.</P>
      <P>"In all respects, the molecular outflow of ISO-Oph 102 is a scaled-down version
of the outflow process seen in young stars," they concluded.</P>
      <P>ALMA, or the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, is a collaborative project
conducted by Europe, Japan, the United States, and Taiwan. The ALMA employs 66
antennas of various sizes to form the largest ground-based radio telescope so
far at the 5,000-meter-high foothills of the Andes in Chile.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A staunch supporter of former President Chen Shui-bian was booked by police
Monday for snatching the wig off the head of ruling Kuomintang Legislator Chiu
Yi, an outspoken critic of Chen.</P>
      <P>The incident took place when Chiu was emerging from the Control Yuan after
urging the government's supreme watchdog to initiate a probe into the judge who
released Chen Shui-bian on his own recognizance last Saturday.</P>
      <P>The man, who was loitering outside the Control Yuan with a group of men who
claimed to be Chen's "bodyguards, " charged at Chiu and grabbed at his wig
before police could stop him.</P>
      <P>He was overpowered immediately by police, while the lawmaker was driven away by
his aide in a car, minus his hairpiece.</P>
      <P>The man, identified only by his family name of Huang, was booked by police, who
later quoted him as saying that he "accidentally ran into" the lawmaker and that
Chiu lost his wig while fleeing the scene.</P>
      <P>Police said Huang, who hails from Tainan City in southern Taiwan, is a firm
supporter of Chen and that he also had a brush with the law in Tainan in 2006
for heckling protesters who were calling for Chen's ouster.</P>
      <P>According to police, Huang waited for Chiu outside the Control Yuan after
learning from the TV news that the legislator intended to file a complaint
against Judge Chou Chan-chun.</P>
      <P>Chiu said the previous day that Chou's decision to reject a request from
prosecutors to keep the former president in custody was flawed and he urged the
Control Yuan to step in and reverse the ruling, arguing that ex-leaders are more
likely to elude justice than ordinary people and citing the examples of
disgraced Philippines ex-President Ferdinand Marcos and Peru's former President
Alberto Fujimori.</P>
      <P>The judge released Chen after he was formally indicted by prosecutors on charges
of corruption, forgery and money laundering.</P>

      <P>Maritime pilots from both Kaohsiung and Keelung harbors -- Taiwan's two major
seaports -- on Monday welcomed the launch of direct cross-Taiwan Strait shipping
links.</P>
      <P>They believe the opening of direct shipping routes for Taiwanese and Chinese
ships traveling to each other's ports will significantly increase the number of
ships docking at the ports, and benefit harbors in Taiwan, which have seen a
decline in ships in recent years.</P>
      <P>A pilot working at the southern port city of Kaohsiung said business at Taiwan's
largest harbor will definitely soar with the historic inauguration of the direct
cross-Taiwan Strait shipping links Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese and Chinese ships will exchange an even greater number of visits to
seaports from each other's side in days to come with the opening of cross-strait
shipping links that was made possible after Taiwan and China sealed four
agreements Nov. 4 to further expand transportation exchanges, launch postal
services and address food safety issues.</P>
      <P>The pilot, who preferred to speak on condition of anonymity, said the number of
vessels visiting Kaohsiung has suddenly soared with the launch of the cross-
strait shipping links -- a phenomenon that was seldom seen over the past decade
as Kaohsiung Harbor's container handling volume has been on a steady decline,
with the number of container ships from around the world visiting it continuing
to decrease.</P>
      <P>He said he has keenly expected the launch of direct cross-strait shipping links,
believing it will rev up Kaohsiung Harbor's business once and for all and boost
his own incomes.</P>
      <P>A pilot working at the northern port of Keelung said the opening was a shot in
the arm for both the harbor and for Taiwan's pilots, whose incomes have
decreased over the past several years noticeably due to declining shipping
transport business in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The pilot, who was also reluctant to have his name known, said in recent months,
his monthly salary -- mainly depending on the number of vessels he piloted --
has declined by about one-fourth to a tune between NT$300,000 and NT$400,000
(US$12,048), compared to an average of NT$500,000 per month during the 60s and
70s.</P>
      <P>The shipping links officially got underway at 10 a.m. Monday at the Kaohsiung
Harbor, with the Uni-Adroit, a full-container ship owned and operated by
Taiwan's Evergreen Marine Corp, setting sail for China's northern port city of
Tianjin.</P>
      <P>The Uni-Adroit, with a capacity of 1,168 TEUs, was scheduled to sail directly
from Kaohsiung to Tianjin's New Port before heading to the northern Chinese
ports Dalian and Qingdao on its way home, according to an Evergreen spokesman.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, four container ships owned and operated by Taiwan's Wan Hai Lines,
Yang Ming Marine Transport Corp., Taiwan Navigation Co. and China's Huarong
Marine Co., respectively, also departed Monday from Taiwan's northern port of
Keelung for various Chinese seaports, including Shanghai and Dalian.</P>
      <P>Also on Monday, 15 Chinese vessels were scheduled to set sail from six Chinese
seaports, including Tianjin and Shanghai, for Taiwan's Kaohsiung, Keelung and
Taichung harbors.</P>
      <P>A maritime pilot is a mariner who guides ships through dangerous or congested
waters, such as harbors or river mouths. Legally the master remains in command
of the ship. The pilot is a senior adviser only. It is one of the oldest, least
known professions and yet one of the most important in terms of maritime safety.
The economic and environmental risk from today's large cargo ships makes the
role of the pilot essential.</P>
      <P>Normally the pilot joins an incoming ship at sea via pilot boat and climbs a
swaying Jacob's ladder sometimes up 40 feet to the deck of the largest container
and tanker ships. With outgoing vessels, a pilot boat returns the pilot to land
after the ship has successfully negotiated coastal waters.</P>

      <P>The Tainan county government in southern Taiwan has decided to build a science
museum in an industrial park there to create recreational and educational
functions that will be open to the public, a local official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The museum, tentatively named the Life Science Story House, will be located in a
two-story building in the Tree Valley Park, an industrial area designed to also
function as an ecological park, the official said.</P>
      <P>It will host collections and exhibitions on animal science, human life and
history, and will introduce the relationship between the development of science
and human civilization, the official went on.</P>
      <P>The building's roof will be used for birdwatching and stargazing and its
surrounding green land will serve as a concert venue, the official continued,
adding that construction is expected to be completed by the end of next year.</P>
      <P>The Tree Valley Park, which is so named to reflect its ecological image, will be
open to both company personnel who work there and to the general public, the
official said.</P>
      <P>A total of 13 enterprises have invested in the 247-hectare park within the last
year, including Chi Mei Corp., a leading plastics producer, the official noted.</P>
      <P>Tainan Magistrate Su Huan-chih said investment in the park has been particularly
efficient thanks to the county's plan that allows the private sector to take
charge of land development projects without wasting time waiting for the
government's time-consuming land development procedures.</P>
      <P>Su thanked Chi Mei Corp. for providing 20,000 jobs for local people, as well as
planting 100,000 trees in the park, noting that the move has transformed the
area.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government urged to strengthen climate policies</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government was urged by the Taiwan Green Party Monday to strengthen its
climate policies and impose carbon taxes in the wake of a consensus reached at a
summit Friday by European Union leaders on a so-called 20-20-20 package that
aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 compared to the 1990
level, make 20 percent energy savings and bring renewable energy sources up to
20 percent of total energy use.</P>
      <P>Green Party Secretary-General Pan Han-shen criticized the various targets set by
the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou as "too loose, " referring to Ma's
vow on World Environment Day June 5 to maintain Taiwan's greenhouse gas
emissions as 2008 levels, reduce the emissions to 2000 levels by 2025 and halve
the emissions from 2000 levels by 2050.</P>
      <P>Pan was also scathing about the Executive Yuan's passage -- also on World
Environment Day -- of the Sustainable Energy Policy Guidelines, according to
which the government should raise energy efficiency by 2 percent every year
during the coming eight years, and reduce energy intensity by at least 20
percent by 2015 compared to the 2005 level.</P>
      <P>The guidelines also aim to increase the low-carbon energy proportion of the
country's total energy supply to more than 55 percent by 2025.</P>
      <P>Citing Claude Turmes, a Luxembourg Green Party member of the European
parliament, Pan urged the government to take advantage of the current economic
slump to adjust domestic industrial structure, warning that otherwise, energy
consumption in Taiwan might become even greater when the economy is revitalized.</P>
      <P>Turmes said recently that governments of EU countries are "using the economic
downturn as an excuse to water down their climate policies."</P>
      <P>Pan also suggested that the government impose carbon taxes that would make the
heavier polluters pay more.</P>
      <P>An official of the Environmental Protection Administration said that Europe,
with its advanced technology and funds, as well as the higher public perceptions
about the environment, is certainly the most capable and active in terms of
reducing greenhouse  gas emissions.</P>
      <P>But asked if Taiwan's greenhouse gas emission reduction targets are looser than
those of Europe, he said that every country has its own unique background  and
should therefore set up their own individual emission reduction targets.</P>
      <P>"After all, (reducing greenhouse gas emissions) is a `common but differentiated
responsibility, '" he said, adding that in Taiwan's case "at present, we are
still building our capacity."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Air fares for flights to China could be cut by New Year: airline</HEADLINE>

      <P>Fares for daily passenger charter flights across the Taiwan Strait could be
adjusted downwards before the New Year because of supply exceeding demand for
seats at current prices, a local airline official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The TransAsia Airways official noted that it used an Airbus A-321 aircraft with
a capacity of 182 passengers to fly the Taipei-Shanghai route Monday -- the
first flight to leave for China under a new daily cross-Taiwan Strait passenger
charter agreement -- but only 144 passengers were on board.</P>
      <P>The passenger load factor of only about 80 percent on the inaugural flight led
the official to forecast that supply would exceed demand for future flights.</P>
      <P>"Considering the market, a price cut is inevitable and the cuts could come
before the New Year," he said.</P>
      <P>The official anticipated that from now until Chinese New Year, which falls on
Jan. 26, will be a low season for tourism. He said the airline will stand pat
for the time being before deciding on price cuts or seeking strategic
cooperation with other air carriers based on market needs and the economic
situation.</P>
      <P>The official noted that when weekend charter flights between Taiwan and China
were inaugurated in July, most observers believed that the flights would not be
able to meet demand, but the reverse has turned out to be true.</P>
      <P>The daily passenger charters were expected to draw more interest than the
weekend flights because they operated daily and offered shorter flight times to
destinations in central and northern China.</P>
      <P>But despite the shorter flight times and distances, reports said air fares on
the Taipei-Shanghai route had fallen by only NT$1,000, from NT$17,000 and
NT$18,000 to NT$16,000 and NT$17,000, prices some consumers still consider too
high.</P>
      <P>Weekend charter passenger services were inaugurated in July. Monday marked the
beginning of expanded air links, with the number of flights provided rising from
36 to 108 per week, that were finalized in an agreement signed between Taiwan
and China in early November.</P>
      <P>Unlike the weekend flights, which were required to pass through the flight
information region of Hong Kong or Macau, the daily flights to central and
northern China are being allowed to pass through the flight information region
of Japan, resulting in shorter flying times.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Southern counties eyeing tourism opportunities from direct links</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A tourism promotion task force of Kaohsiung City, Kaohsiung County and Pingtung
County in southern Taiwan is preparing to make concerted efforts to lure more
Chinese tourists following the opening Monday of direct transport links between
Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>The task force, led by Kaohsiung city government adviser Lin Fu-nan and composed
of tourism officials and tourism association representatives from the three
administrative regions, is slated to meet Thursday to devise a strategy to lure
more visitors from China.</P>
      <P>Direct daily charter flights, shipping and postal links between Taiwan and China
kicked off Monday -- the first since the People's Republic of China was
established in 1949.</P>
      <P>Under the new links, Taiwan has opened 11 ports to vessels linking up with up to
63 ports in China.</P>
      <P>Earlier Monday, a vessel belonging to Evergreen Marine Corp. set out from the
southern Taiwan port of Kaohsiung, the country's biggest, to the port of Tianjin
in northern China's Hebei province.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou presided over the ceremony held in Kaohsiung marking the
historical launch of the direct shipping links.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Port, once the world's third-largest container port, is hoping that
the direct links well help improve its competitiveness and reverse its declining
container traffic rankings that left it in eighth place in the world in 2007.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung  Harbor  Bureau  Director-General  Hsieh Ming-huei estimated that the
direct shipping links with China will boost the number of TEUs (twenty-foot
equivalent units) the port handles by one million a year.</P>
      <P>At present,  Kaohsiung Port handles about 10 million TEUs annually, leaving it
just behind Rotterdam and Dubai in the world rankings and just ahead of the
fast-growing Chinese ports of Qingdao, Ningbo and Guangzhou.</P>
      <P>The real estate market, particularly commercial property owners, in Kaohsiung
City is also looking for a new lease on life with the establishment of direct
cross-strait shipping links.</P>
      <P>The local land development and construction sector is eagerly hoping that the
links can help bring to Kaohsiung more resources, including talent, technology,
raw materials and investment.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City hopes to replace Hong Kong or Singapore as a business operations
hub and a research and development center in the Asia-Pacific region, said Cheng
Wu-tsong, chairman of the city's construction association.</P>
      <P>Huang Fu-chiao,  chairman  of the Kaohsiung  County Travel Association, said the
direct Taiwan-China transportation links will help Taiwan's tourism and ease
tensions across the strait.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, Kaohsiung County hopes to capitalize on its rich cultural
heritage and ecological  diversity in attracting tourists.</P>
      <P>For instance, he said, Chinese visitors should be interested in the important
cultural and religious sites of the Hakka-style Meinong township and Foguangshan
Temple, as well as the hot spring resort area of Baolai in Liouguei village and
the many fruit orchards scattered across the county.</P>
      <P>Hoteliers in Baolai are keen to embrace Chinese tourists in the hope of
strengthening their businesses, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Dates, guavas, wax apples and lichis cultivated in Kaohsiung County enjoy renown
for their fine quality among Taiwanese consumers and could also prove to be good
draws.</P>
      <P>Despite disappointing arrival numbers to date following an agreement opening
tourism to Taiwan in June, Huang believed that more Chinese tourists will come
to Taiwan following the Lunar New Year holiday in late January 2009.</P>
      <P>In neighboring Pingtung County, many wax apple growers have begun to weigh the
possibility of shipping the fragile fruit to China -- something which was beyond
their imagination in the past -- thanks to the direct shipping links.</P>
      <P>Although the Pingtung County government has been selling locally produced
pineapples, papayas, dates, bananas and lemons to China in recent years, many
local wax apple farmers are hesitant to follow suit out of concerns over greater
difficulties to preserve them.</P>
      <P>Yao Chih-wang, a section chief of the county's agriculture bureau, contended
that the reduced shipping time will definitely help Pingtung export its high-
quality fruit to China, but suggested it would take time for local farmers to
feel the impact of the direct links.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>After nearly six decades, Taiwan and China on Monday resumed daily direct
passenger flights, direct cargo flights and direct shipping links, seen by many
as a step toward ending decades of hostilities and cutting the cost of travel
and trade between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Daily nonstop charter flights, which will fly more direct routes across the
Taiwan Strait, were inaugurated Monday.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) , a flight from
Shenzhen, China, to Taipei landed shortly before 9 a.m. while the first flight
from Taipei to Shanghai, China, departed at 8 a.m.</P>
      <P>In the first week, 16 daily flights to or from Taiwan and 101 cross-strait
flights are scheduled. Eventually, up to 108 flights will be available each week
between the two sides, with flight times on the most popular route -- Taipei-
Shanghai -- shortened by as much as one hour.</P>
      <P>In addition to daily direct air service, direct shipping was also launched for
the first time since the establishment of the People's Republic of China in
1949.</P>
      <P>Ceremonies were held at seaports in China as well as in Taiwan's Keelung,
Taichung and Kaohsiung harbors, to send off commercial vessels on direct routes
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In all, ships will be able to sail between 11 ports in Taiwan and 63 ports in
China, including Tianjin, Dalian, Qingdao and Shanghai, without being required
to transit through a third region.</P>
      <P>Among the ships taking part in the inaugural direct sailings on were vessels
belonging to Evergreen Marine Corp. and Yang Ming Marine Transport Corp.</P>
      <P>Evergreen's vessel embarked from Kaohsiung bound for Tianjin, while Yang Ming's
set sail from Keelung bound for Shanghai. At the same time, two Chinese vessels
left from Tianjin and Shanghai on nonstop voyages to ports in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou traveled to Kaohsiung Monday for the ceremony marking the
historic inauguration of direct cross-Taiwan Strait shipping links.</P>
      <P>"The opening of direct air and shipping links means the two sides are no longer
hostile toward each other and are willing to replace confrontation with dialogue
and conflict with reconciliation, " Ma said.</P>
      <P>The launch of the direct cross-strait shipping links is one of four agreements
sealed by the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) on Nov. 4.</P>
      <P>The others expanded air links from weekend to daily nonstop charter flights, and
established direct postal services and a food safety mechanism.</P>
      <P>The opening up of Taiwan and China's airspace and water to each other will not
only cut travel and shipping times, but also the costs of doing business between
the two key trading partners, which are suffering from the global economic
downturn.</P>
      <P>According to Premier Liu Chao-shuan, ships with 20,000 tons of cargo will save
NT$200,000 per shipment because of the direct links.</P>
      <P>"I am very happy to see that a new page has been turned in shipping links
between Taiwan and mainland China," Liu said at the launch ceremony at Keelung
Harbor.</P>
      <P>"We have worked for several years to make this happen. I am happy to see this
progress, but I am sad that it took us so long to complete this step," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Such direct links were not possible in the past because China refused to
negotiate with former President Chen Shui-bian, whose administration staunchly
supported Taiwan's independence.</P>
      <P>Since being elected as president in March, Ma has invested enormous efforts in
cultivating improving relations with Beijing, openly stating that he opposes
reunification with or independence from China and favors pursuing a policy
focused in economic ties.</P>
      <P>Out of humanitarian concern, the former KMT government started to allow
Taiwanese people to visit their families and relatives in China on Nov. 2, 1987,
opening a limited door for exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In recent years, as the cross-strait exchanges have steadily increased, the
demand for the opening of the "three links" -- direct transportation,
communications and trade links between Taiwan and China -- has been growing,
partly due to increased trade and travel between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Responding to the people's call, the government established the "small three
links" between Taiwan's Kinmen and Matsu and China's Fujian Province on Apr. 5,
2000.</P>

      <P>Fifty drivers of the Taiwan Taxi Co. who each smoked 20 to 30 years before
kicking the habit will serve as ambassadors to promote non-smoking in the coming
two months, the taxi company announced Monday.</P>
      <P>These taxi drivers joined a program to quit smoking offered by Taiwan Adventist
Hospital in Taipei in August 2007 and successfully got rid of their addiction to
nicotine.</P>
      <P>Liao Chia-ching, who smoked at least 20 cigarettes a day for 37 years, recounted
that he was not sure whether he could succeed when he first joined the program
on Aug. 8 last year.</P>
      <P>"I am proud that, with the interim use of nicotine patches, I made it," Liao
said.</P>
      <P>According to Wu Hsien-lin,  a physician in the hospital's Department of Thoracic
Medicine, the taxi drivers in last year's program had an 80 percent success rate
in quitting smoking, the highest ever achieved by the hospital.</P>
      <P>Wu said the taxi drivers will share their experience with passengers, providing
free brochures and compact discs about the hazards of smoking, and invite
smokers to join anti-smoking programs.</P>
      <P>The taxi drivers' "say goodbye to nicotine" campaign is also intended to call
public attention to Taiwan's newly amended Tobacco Hazards Prevention Act, which
will take effect on Jan. 11, 2009.</P>
      <P>Under the act, smoking is banned in indoor public areas, including KTV lounges,
bowling alleys, cybercafes, and passenger waiting rooms, as well as in indoor
working areas with over three people.</P>
      <P>Smoking is also prohibited in outdoor public areas, including train station
platforms,  gymnasiums,  swimming pools,  college campuses, and entertainment

      <P>Flight controllers in Taipei and Shanghai simultaneously announced the
inauguration of a new air route between the two cities at 8: 06 a.m. Monday,
ushering in a new era in air traffic across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Both Taipei Area Control Center Director Chi Liang and his Shanghai counterpart,
Qian Haisheng, expressed their resolve at the inaugural  ceremony  to make every
possible  effort to ensure cross-strait flight safety.</P>
      <P>Almost at the same time, a China Eastern Airlines aircraft took off from
Shanghai en route to Taoyuan in northern Taiwan and a few minutes later, a
TransAsia Airways plane set off on a flight from Taipei to Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Both planes used the flight numbers of the new direct flight route. Radar data
at the Taipei Area Control Center showed that both aircraft reached the new
waypoint "SULEM" at 8:47 a.m., where flight controllers from the two sides
handed off air traffic control responsibilities to their counterparts.</P>
      <P>Despite a 3,000-foot difference in altitude between the two flights, it marked
the first time in six decades that flight controllers from Taiwan and China had
engaged in direct dialogue above the center line of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Flight controllers exchanged greetings and looked forward to cooperating with
each other.</P>
      <P>When direct weekend cross-strait charter flight services opened in July,
aircraft had to pass through the Hong Kong and Jeju Island flight information
regions, and air traffic controllers on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait did
not come in direct contact with each other.</P>
      <P>With the charter flights expanded to daily service, the flight route on all
northbound flights to various Chinese destinations, such as Shanghai, Hengzhou,
Beijing and Dalian, was straightened.</P>
      <P>Carriers will now fly a route that requires the transfer of air traffic control
at waypoint "SULEM."</P>
      <P>The waypoint "SULEM, " located at the intersection of Taiwan and China's flight
information regions (FIRs) , acquired its name last month  in  an agreement
between  Taiwan's  Civil  Aeronautics Administration and its Chinese
counterpart, the Civil Aviation Administration of China.</P>
      <P>From now on, a China-bound plane, after taking off from Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport, will first fly northward along the B576 international
flight route and turn in a northwest direction after reaching the "BERBA"
waypoint sitting on the intersection of Taiwan and Japan's FIRs.</P>
      <P>After reaching the waypoint "OLIVE" in Taiwan's FIR, the flights will turn
westward and Taiwan's flight controllers will hand off air traffic control
responsibilities to their Chinese counterparts when the flight reaches "SULEM."</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Taiwan-bound flights from China will also see transfer of air
traffic control responsibilities at the waypoint "SULEM, "a CAA official said.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese carriers had an average passenger load factor of over 76 percent on
the first day of daily nonstop charter flights between Taiwan and China, higher
than the 67 percent recorded by Chinese airlines, the Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA) reported Monday.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the CAA, flights operated by three Taiwanese
carriers filled 3,753 of the 4,899 seats available from Taiwan to four Chinese
destinations, while six Chinese carriers flew 1,829 passengers, or 67 percent of
the combined 2,722-seat capacity, from China to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The three Taiwanese carriers -- China Airlines, EVA Airways and TransAsia
Airways -- operated 16 two-way charter flights from Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport and Taipei Songshan Airport to Shanghai, Hangzhou, Shenzhen and
Guangzhou in China.</P>
      <P>Six Chinese carriers flew a total of 16 charter flights from Shanghai, Tianjin,
Hangzhou, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen to Taoyuan and Taipei in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Monday's charters were the first nonstop daily flights between Taiwan and China
since 1949, when the People's Republic of China was founded and the Kuomintang
set up a separate government on the island.</P>
      <P>The charters were made possible by a set of accords signed by Taipei and Beijing
in early November, which also paved the way for the launching of direct postal

    <HEADLINE>Keelung expects renewed prosperity from direct shipping with China</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The northern Taiwan port city of Keelung is banking on the newly opened direct
shipping links with 60 ports in China for renewed prosperity, experts in the
container shipping business said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yang Chi-li,  president  of the Keelung Shipping  Agencies Association, said the
direct shipping links will be a shot in the arm for the seaport because they not
only shorten shipping times but also cut operational costs, creating the
prospect for a renewed container shipping boom in the city.</P>
      <P>Yang pointed out that container shipping is the lifeline of the port and the
city.</P>
      <P>Keelung was the world's seventh busiest container port in 1984, but has since
fallen, to 32nd in 2002 and to 45th in 2007.</P>
      <P>"Increased  container handling at Keelung port will create business for other
sectors, including customs clearance companies, shipping agencies, loading and
offloading services, hauling firms, and warehouses," Yang explained.</P>
      <P>Huang Li-kuang, an executive at the corporate planning and management department
of Wan Hai Lines, Ltd., said direct shipping links can save his company NT$160
million (US$4.8 million) a year and cut shipping times in half, and that as a
result, the benefits can be shared with other related sectors.</P>
      <P>Yang Ching-yun, chief of the information division under the Department of
General Affairs of the Keelung City government, said the direct shipping links
are also expected to benefit local commerce and tourism-related industries.</P>
      <P>Under a pact signed in early November, Taiwan has opened 11 ports and China 63
ports to direct cross-Taiwan Strait shipping. The historic change now makes it
unnecessary for vessels to make a brief stop at the Japanese island of Ishigaki.</P>
      <P>According to experts' estimates, it will take about 17 hours to sail directly
between Keelung and Shanghai harbors, about nine hours shorter than before,
while it will take about six hours to sail between Keelung and Fuzhou ports,
saving about 12 hours.</P>
      <P>Located near the northern tip of Taiwan, Keelung port has 57 berths and two
container terminals, one each on its eastern and western banks. Fifteen of the
container berths are equipped with 29 gantry cranes capable of handling 13-18
rows of containers at a time. The port can accommodate vessels of 60,000 dead
weight tons.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's premium agricultural produce will enjoy a competitive edge with the
opening Monday of direct shipping links between Taiwan and China, an executive
with Yunlin's Farmer United Logistics Corp. said.</P>
      <P>Company chairman Lin Chi-chang made the remarks as the first batch of oranges
carried by a container vessel directly to China left Kaohsiung Monday morning
and is expected to arrive at Xiamen at night.</P>
      <P>The 43 tons of liu ding -- Taiwan's orange variety -- is the first shipment
among 1,000 tons of oranges China promised to buy.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that with the inauguration of direct shipping links, the total
shipping time to customers has been cut from an average of one week to two or
three days.</P>
      <P>He said it was really "exciting" that the oranges will arrive on the same day
they leave Taiwan when shipped to Xiamen, the Chinese port closest to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin was also happy that the oranges would be sold at a price of NT$13 per kilo,
higher than the market price.</P>
      <P>Pingtung County wax apple growers are also eyeing Chinese markets now that
direct shipping links have begun.</P>
      <P>Wang Jui-hsiung, a noted grower who gained fame for his "black diamond wax
apple, " said Taiwanese businessmen are keen on exporting them on his behalf.</P>
      <P>He had resisted such interest in the past because wax apples are hard to keep
fresh and spoil easily.</P>
      <P>"Shipping by air was too expensive and shipping by sea required to be
transshipped, cutting into the profits in the past," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Pingtung County over the past three or four years has begun to ship agricultural
produce, mainly wax apples, guavas, pineapples, dates, bananas and lemons to
Xiamen, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Beijing and northeastern China.</P>
      <P>But because of difficulties in keeping the fruit fresh, the volume of exports
remains limited.</P>

      <P>Fifty drivers of the Taiwan Taxi Co. who each smoked 20 to 30 years before
kicking the habit will serve as ambassadors to promote non-smoking in the coming
two months, the taxi company announced Monday.</P>
      <P>These taxi drivers joined a program to quit smoking offered by Taiwan Adventist
Hospital in Taipei in August 2007 and successfully got rid of their addiction to
nicotine.</P>
      <P>Liao Chia-ching, who smoked at least 20 cigarettes a day for 37 years, recounted
that he was not sure whether he could succeed when he first joined the program
on Aug. 8 last year.</P>
      <P>"I am proud that, with the interim use of nicotine patches, I made it," Liao
said.</P>
      <P>According to Wu Hsien-lin,  a physician in the hospital's Department of Thoracic
Medicine, the taxi drivers in last year's program had an 80 percent success rate
in quitting smoking, the highest ever achieved by the hospital.</P>
      <P>Wu said the taxi drivers will share their experience with passengers, providing
free brochures and compact discs about the hazards of smoking, and invite
smokers to join anti-smoking programs.</P>
      <P>The taxi drivers' "say goodbye to nicotine" campaign is also intended to call
public attention to Taiwan's newly amended Tobacco Hazards Prevention Act, which
will take effect on Jan. 11, 2009.</P>
      <P>Under the act, smoking is banned in indoor public areas, including KTV lounges,
bowling alleys, cybercafes, and passenger waiting rooms, as well as in indoor
working areas with over three people.</P>
      <P>Smoking is also prohibited in outdoor public areas, including train station
platforms,  gymnasiums,  swimming pools,  college campuses, and entertainment
areas.</P>
      <P>Those who violate the law can be fined between NT$2,000 and NT$10,000 (US$605).</P>

      <P>Changhua County has inaugurated its first "English village, " aiming to help
students improve their ability to communicate in English in a vivid learning
environment, Changhua County Magistrate Cho Po-yuan said Monday.</P>
      <P>The language learning village at the central county's Minsheng Elementary School
simulates a high speed rail station, with a panel showing arriving and departing
train schedules, ticket booths, and even mock trains deployed in three
classrooms.</P>
      <P>Cho was present at the opening of the village held earlier in the day and led a
group of county government officials in practicing English with students who
were acting as station staffers.</P>
      <P>Students at the village can learn how to deal with tasks related to this
scenario such as buying tickets and also learn how to describe local cultures in
English, Cho said.</P>
      <P>Every student who steps into the village environment is required to communicate
with others in English.</P>
      <P>The county plans to create three other English villages, with each simulating a
different scenario, including a hypermarket at Hsinkang Elementary School, a
fast food restaurant at Hsinmin Elementary School, and an international airport
at Erlin Elementary School, Cho said.</P>
      <P>The four villages will be utilized by all junior high and elementary school

      <P>Flight controllers in Taipei and Shanghai simultaneously announced the
inauguration of a new air route between the two cities at 8: 06 a.m. Monday,
ushering in a new era in air traffic across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Both Taipei Area Control Center Director Chi Liang and his Shanghai counterpart,
Qian Haisheng, expressed their resolve at the inaugural  ceremony  to make every
possible  effort to ensure cross-strait flight safety.</P>
      <P>Almost at the same time, a China Eastern Airlines aircraft took off from
Shanghai en route to Taoyuan in northern Taiwan and a few minutes later, a
TransAsia Airways plane set off on a flight from Taipei to Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Both planes used the flight numbers of the new direct flight route. Radar data
at the Taipei Area Control Center showed that both aircraft reached the new
waypoint "SULEM" at 8:47 a.m., where flight controllers from the two sides
handed off air traffic control responsibilities to their counterparts.</P>
      <P>Despite a 3,000-foot difference in altitude between the two flights, it marked
the first time in six decades that flight controllers from Taiwan and China had
engaged in direct dialogue above the center line of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Flight controllers exchanged greetings and looked forward to cooperating with
each other.</P>
      <P>When direct weekend cross-strait charter flight services opened in July,
aircraft had to pass through the Hong Kong and Jeju Island flight information
regions, and air traffic controllers on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait did
not come in direct contact with each other.</P>
      <P>With the charter flights expanded to daily service, the flight route on all
northbound flights to various Chinese destinations, such as Shanghai, Hengzhou,
Beijing and Dalian, was straightened.</P>
      <P>Carriers will now fly a route that requires the transfer of air traffic control
at waypoint "SULEM."</P>
      <P>The waypoint "SULEM, " located at the intersection of Taiwan and China's flight
information regions (FIRs) , acquired its name last month  in  an agreement
between  Taiwan's  Civil  Aeronautics Administration and its Chinese
counterpart, the Civil Aviation Administration of China.</P>
      <P>From now on, a China-bound plane, after taking off from Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport, will first fly northward along the B576 international
flight route and turn in a northwest direction after reaching the "BERBA"
waypoint sitting on the intersection of Taiwan and Japan's FIRs.</P>
      <P>After reaching the waypoint "OLIVE" in Taiwan's FIR, the flights will turn
westward and Taiwan's flight controllers will hand off air traffic control
responsibilities to their Chinese counterparts when the flight reaches "SULEM."</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Taiwan-bound flights from China will also see transfer of air
traffic control responsibilities at the waypoint "SULEM, "a CAA official said.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese carriers had an average passenger load factor of over 76 percent on
the first day of daily nonstop charter flights between Taiwan and China, higher
than the 67 percent recorded by Chinese airlines, the Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA) reported Monday.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the CAA, flights operated by three Taiwanese
carriers filled 3,753 of the 4,899 seats available from Taiwan to four Chinese
destinations, while six Chinese carriers flew 1,829 passengers, or 67 percent of
the combined 2,722-seat capacity, from China to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The three Taiwanese carriers -- China Airlines, EVA Airways and TransAsia
Airways -- operated 16 two-way charter flights from Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport and Taipei Songshan Airport to Shanghai, Hangzhou, Shenzhen and
Guangzhou in China.</P>
      <P>Six Chinese carriers flew a total of 16 charter flights from Shanghai, Tianjin,
Hangzhou, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen to Taoyuan and Taipei in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Monday's charters were the first nonstop daily flights between Taiwan and China
since 1949, when the People's Republic of China was founded and the Kuomintang
set up a separate government on the island.</P>
      <P>The charters were made possible by a set of accords signed by Taipei and Beijing
in early November, which also paved the way for the launching of direct postal
and shipping links on Monday.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The northern Taiwan port city of Keelung is banking on the newly opened direct
shipping links with 60 ports in China for renewed prosperity, experts in the
container shipping business said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yang Chi-li,  president  of the Keelung Shipping  Agencies Association, said the
direct shipping links will be a shot in the arm for the seaport because they not
only shorten shipping times but also cut operational costs, creating the
prospect for a renewed container shipping boom in the city.</P>
      <P>Yang pointed out that container shipping is the lifeline of the port and the
city.</P>
      <P>Keelung was the world's seventh busiest container port in 1984, but has since
fallen, to 32nd in 2002 and to 45th in 2007.</P>
      <P>"Increased  container handling at Keelung port will create business for other
sectors, including customs clearance companies, shipping agencies, loading and
offloading services, hauling firms, and warehouses," Yang explained.</P>
      <P>Huang Li-kuang, an executive at the corporate planning and management department
of Wan Hai Lines, Ltd., said direct shipping links can save his company NT$160
million (US$4.8 million) a year and cut shipping times in half, and that as a
result, the benefits can be shared with other related sectors.</P>
      <P>Yang Ching-yun, chief of the information division under the Department of
General Affairs of the Keelung City government, said the direct shipping links
are also expected to benefit local commerce and tourism-related industries.</P>
      <P>Under a pact signed in early November, Taiwan has opened 11 ports and China 63
ports to direct cross-Taiwan Strait shipping. The historic change now makes it
unnecessary for vessels to make a brief stop at the Japanese island of Ishigaki.</P>
      <P>According to experts' estimates, it will take about 17 hours to sail directly
between Keelung and Shanghai harbors, about nine hours shorter than before,
while it will take about six hours to sail between Keelung and Fuzhou ports,
saving about 12 hours.</P>
      <P>Located near the northern tip of Taiwan, Keelung port has 57 berths and two
container terminals, one each on its eastern and western banks. Fifteen of the
container berths are equipped with 29 gantry cranes capable of handling 13-18
rows of containers at a time. The port can accommodate vessels of 60,000 dead
weight tons.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's premium agricultural produce will enjoy a competitive edge with the
opening Monday of direct shipping links between Taiwan and China, an executive
with Yunlin's Farmer United Logistics Corp. said.</P>
      <P>Company chairman Lin Chi-chang made the remarks as the first batch of oranges
carried by a container vessel directly to China left Kaohsiung Monday morning
and is expected to arrive at Xiamen at night.</P>
      <P>The 43 tons of liu ding -- Taiwan's orange variety -- is the first shipment
among 1,000 tons of oranges China promised to buy.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that with the inauguration of direct shipping links, the total
shipping time to customers has been cut from an average of one week to two or
three days.</P>
      <P>He said it was really "exciting" that the oranges will arrive on the same day
they leave Taiwan when shipped to Xiamen, the Chinese port closest to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin was also happy that the oranges would be sold at a price of NT$13 per kilo,
higher than the market price.</P>
      <P>Pingtung County wax apple growers are also eyeing Chinese markets now that
direct shipping links have begun.</P>
      <P>Wang Jui-hsiung, a noted grower who gained fame for his "black diamond wax
apple, " said Taiwanese businessmen are keen on exporting them on his behalf.</P>
      <P>He had resisted such interest in the past because wax apples are hard to keep
fresh and spoil easily.</P>
      <P>"Shipping by air was too expensive and shipping by sea required to be
transshipped, cutting into the profits in the past," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Pingtung County over the past three or four years has begun to ship agricultural
produce, mainly wax apples, guavas, pineapples, dates, bananas and lemons to
Xiamen, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Beijing and northeastern China.</P>
      <P>But because of difficulties in keeping the fruit fresh, the volume of exports
remains limited.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of inbound travelers to Taiwan increased significantly with the
launch of daily passenger charter flights between Taiwan and China, reflecting
the greater convenience of the new service, the National Immigration Agency
(NIA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>On the first day of the charter service Monday, a total of 30,372 travelers
entered the country through Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, representing a
rise of 4,293 from the same day last week when there were 26,079 travelers, NIA
statistics showed.</P>
      <P>The number of arrivals and departures totaled 60,591, which was similar to the
average daily traffic, the NIA said.</P>
      <P>There were a total of 18 flights between Taoyuan and China's Shanghai, Beijing,
Tianjin, Hangzhou, Guangzhou and Shenzhen on the first day of the service.</P>
      <P>The daily charter services are an expansion of the weekend charter passenger
services that have been operating between Friday and Monday since July.</P>
      <P>During the first week of the daily passenger services, five Taiwanese carriers
and seven Chinese carriers operating the services will together provide a total
of 101 flights, according to the Civil Aeronautics Administration.</P>
      <P>The routes to be flown during this period will serve 13 Chinese destinations --
Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou,  Xiamen, Hangzhou, Shenzhen, Tianjin,
Chongqing, Chengdu, Fuzhou, Haikou and Dalian.</P>
      <P>The four Taiwanese destinations served will be Taoyuan, Taipei, Kaohsiung and
Taichung.</P>
      <P>Prior to the launch of nonstop charters in July, travelers between Taiwan and
China were required to transit in a third country or territory, usually Hong
Kong.</P>
      <P>The new nonstop flights between Taipei and Shanghai launched Monday take less
than 90 minutes, a major time savings compared to the nearly six hours the same
trip takes when transiting through Hong Kong.</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will form a special task force
to review possible adverse impacts on Taiwan of the launch of direct transport
and postal links across the Taiwan Strait, a DPP legislator said Monday.</P>
      <P>In a further thaw of once stalled relations, Taiwan and China launched daily
direct passenger and cargo flights and direct shipping and postal links Monday.</P>
      <P>Arguing that the new links underscore how quickly ties between Taipei and
Beijing have warmed under "pro-China" President Ma Ying-jeou, DPP legislative
whip Ker Chien-ming accused the Kuomintang administration of failing to consider
the possibly negative impact the new opening will have on Taiwan's sovereignty,
national security and economic well-being.</P>
      <P>According to Ker, the new DPP panel will hold a daily news conference to brief
the public on the impact of the new direct cross-strait links, also known as
"big three links."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  DPP spokesman  Cheng Wen-tsang  said the party headquarters and the
DPP legislative caucus will work together to evaluate the links' potentially
adverse effects on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the KMT administration has only publicized the positive side of
the new links, Cheng said the DPP will inform the public of the links' social
costs.</P>
      <P>Cheng quoted DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen as having said at a party meeting held
earlier in the day that Taiwan could soon become China's economic vassal because
the KMT administration has failed to come up with well-devised complementary
measures before launching the new direct transport links.</P>
      <P>For instance, Cheng said the KMT administration has never evaluated how the "big
three links" may affect Taiwan socially and culturally, such as whether direct
air links will accelerate an exodus of Taiwanese talent to China or help attract
Taiwanese talent to return home.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the DPP will give priority to defending Taiwan's homegrown
industries, job opportunities and competitive edges.</P>

while supplies last. In addition, a 10 percent discount on other items will be
offered until the end of December, Ho said.</P>
      <P>American  visitor  Charles  Shasky said he finds the idea "wonderful," adding
that "it will help attract foreign visitors."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ho said, the museum has also crafted a variety of different
itineraries to suit the particular needs of young people, couples and families.</P>
      <P>For example, she said, young people should visit on Saturday evening to enjoy a
dessert and performance all for less than NT$100 (US$3) , while couples should
walk the valentine trail and enjoy a five-star Christmas dinner near the museum
complex.</P>
      <P>Families can book a guided tour specifically catering to children and a picnic
by a nearby lake.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIT welcomes direct links between Taiwan and China</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), the United States' de facto embassy, has
welcomed the establishment of direct air, shipping and postal links between
Taiwan and China and dismissed concerns such links would draw Taiwan too close
to its cross-Taiwan Strait rival.</P>
      <P>By facilitating the enhancement of cross strait contact, the direct links
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will help regional peace, stability
and prosperity, said AIT spokesman Thomas Mark Hodges Tuesday in welcoming the
development.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China on Monday launched daily nonstop passenger charter flights,
direct cargo flights and direct shipping links, the first time such links have
existed since the People's Republic of China was established in 1949.</P>
      <P>Asked if the U.S. was concerned the links would draw Taiwan too close to China,
Hodges said there was no reason for worry.</P>
      <P>"The U.S. government has long called on Taiwan and the People's Republic of
China (PRC) to find means to engage in dialogue in order to reduce tension
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait,Hodges said.</P>
      <P>We welcome the positive development. There is no need for the U.S. government to
worry about Taiwan and mainland China getting too close.</P>
      <P>Some have speculated that the U.S., which sees Taiwan as a strategic partner in
limiting China's expansion and influence in the region, is concerned that
President Ma Ying-jeou's conciliatory policies toward Beijing are not in its
best interests.</P>
      <P>The U.S. government has repeatedly denied the speculation.</P>

      <P>The United States has corrected an "error" it made in identifying a Kuomintang
(KMT) legislator as an American citizen, after looking further into whether two
KMT lawmakers have dual nationalities, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In an initial report submitted to the ministry on Dec. 5, the U.S. government
apparently said KMT Legislator Kung Wen-chi was an American citizen.</P>
      <P>It recently discovered, however, that it had confused Kung, a male, with a woman
in its database who had the same English name spelling and birth date as the
legislator.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry received the correction from the American Institute in
Taiwan's Washington office Tuesday morning, according to Harry H.J. Tseng, the
deputy director of the MOFA's Department of North American Affairs.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tseng said the investigation into its main target, KMT Legislator Lee
Ching-an, is ongoing and that his ministry expects to receive a "clearer answer"
to its inquiry over whether she holds U.S. citizenship.</P>
      <P>Lee has been hounded by charges that she has dual nationality -- which would be
illegal and force her to abandon the seat she has held since being elected in
1998 -- since a local magazine alleged in June that she held a valid U.S.
passport.</P>
      <P>The ministry received the U.S. government's initial report on the citizenship
status of Taiwan's legislators on Dec. 5, but decided to seek further assistance
from the U.S. on Dec. 10 to clarify some key points in the report that the
ministry found "unclear.</P>
      <P>Speculation quickly arose that the initial U.S. report cited two legislators who
had dual citizenship, with Kung being one of the names most often mentioned.</P>

      <P>The Tainan county government in southern Taiwan plans to upgrade a declining
fishing port by expanding the yacht manufacturing industry and creating
recreational business at the port, a local official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Hsien-ming,  deputy  director-general  of the county's Department of Urban
and Rural Development, said the county government hopes to attract more
investment by yacht manufacturers in the county's Jiangjun Fishing Port.</P>
      <P>There is already a two-hectare yacht manufacturing plant in operation at the
port, and the county government has allocated another 3.6 hectares of land for
possible investments by other yacht making companies, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The 100-hectare port in the county's Jiangjun township was established in 2002
to dock more than 500 fishing vessels, but because of stiff competition from
other fishing ports throughout the county, the number of fishing vessels that
berth there and profits from fishing have dropped in past years, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The local  government  hopes that expansion  of the yacht manufacturing business
at the port will attract yacht lovers and allow for better utilization of the
land, which in turn will help to boost the economy, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Since 2006, the port has been used as a recreational fish market on holidays,
but as business has been below par, the county government now has to try to
increase the fishing business and attract more visitors to the port, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The expansion plan for the port also involves developing a nearby beach, he
added.</P>
      <P>The county government plans to build a resort on a 5.4 hectare tract of land
near the beach and upgrade the water sports facilities there to draw more
tourists, Chen said, adding that the county government is still awaiting central
government approval of the resort project.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan pledged Tuesday to assume political responsibility if
the consumption voucher program does not stimulate at least half of the level of
economic growth anticipated by the government.</P>
      <P>Liu made the pledge  while responding  to questions  from legislators after
delivering a report to the lawmaking body on a special budget plan introduced by
the Cabinet for the voucher program.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet has estimated that the program will help increase the country's
gross domestic product by 0.64 percentage points if all the vouchers are used.</P>
      <P>Liu said, however, that the policy will be considered a failure if the program's
contribution to overall growth lags below 0.32 percentage points, in which case
the Cabinet will assume political responsibility.</P>
      <P>Despite  the pledge,  the premier  cautioned  that it was "unreasonable" to
always demand a certain official to step down for failing to achieve a single
policy.</P>
      <P>Liu said he believes the program will produce better results in Taiwan than in
Japan, given that local businesses have put forth various creative promotional
ideas targeting potential voucher holders even before the vouchers have been
issued.</P>
      <P>He  said  the  vouchers  will  be designed  with  various counterfeit-proof
features and that those who use fake vouchers knowingly will face legal
liability.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet is set to distribute the vouchers to the public Jan. 18 to stimulate
consumption.</P>
      <P>Each Taiwanese citizen with a valid household registration in Taiwan will be
entitled to receive NT$3,600 in vouchers that will have to be exchanged for
goods by Sept. 30, 2009.</P>
      <P>Foreign or Chinese spouses of local citizens who hold legal resident status will

    <HEADLINE>SEF will seek tax relief for Taiwanese businessmen in China</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Deputy Chairman Kao Koong-lian said
Tuesday that the foundation will ask China to consider giving Taiwanese
businessmen there tax relief, as many of them are facing financial difficulties
due to the global economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Kao said he hopes that the government in mainland China will consider decreasing
the investors' burden by lowering the tax levy on them.</P>
      <P>"The economy of the entire world is in recession, " said Kao."There are
different impacts on each and every nation. However, mainland China is not as
seriously affected as other nations."</P>
      <P>Kao said that while he believes Taiwanese businessmen should grasp the
opportunity to invest in mainland China, they are also facing difficulties.</P>
      <P>"The implementation of the Labor Contract Law in mainland China had greatly
increased the operation cost of Taiwan businesses in mainland China," said Kao,
referring to the new law which raises the cost of labor by requiring employers
give workers contracts and insurance.</P>
      <P>The Labor Contract Law came into effect on Jan. 1, 2008, and stipulates that
employment contracts must be put in writing within one month of employment,
employers must fully inform workers of the nature of the job, their working
conditions and compensation. It also limits the ability of employers to use
temporary laborers.</P>
      <P>Kao also noted that China's land use law in cities and towns is also a heavy
burden on Taiwan businessmen and that the SEF hopes that the mainland Chinese
government  will consider allowing Taiwan businessmen to defer this tax payment.</P>
      <P>"The SEF cares about the operation of the Taiwan businessmen in mainland China,
" said Kao."We use all possible means to understand the situation of the Taiwan
businessmen who are operating businesses in mainland China."</P>
      <P>He said he will visit Taiwanese business people in Xiamen on Dec. 20 and will
attend an annual celebration of the Taiwanese business association there.</P>
      <P>SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung will also pay visits to Taiwan business leaders in
Guangdong Province and Jiangsu Province from Jan. 7V11, Kao said.</P>
      <P>"Both Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and I will use our opportunities of visits to
Taiwan businessmen to find out their needs and to help them in any which way we
can," Kao said.</P>
      <P>On the issue of the two mainland Chinese giant pandas coming to Taiwan, Kao
noted that the most likely date for the pandas to arrive is Dec. 23.</P>
      <P>"We have obtained the export permit documents from mainland Chinese
authorities," said Kao. "Now, only the technical details need to be worked out.
These include the type of aircraft to transport the two giant pandas and the
accompanying personnel from mainland China."</P>
      <P>Kao pointed out that the Taipei City government had also sent officials to
accompany the two giant pandas.</P>
      <P>"Everything is ready and waiting, " stressed Kao. "We expect the pandas to be
able to meet the public before the Lunar New Year holiday," Kao said.</P>
      <P>The pandas were officially offered to Taiwan by China as a token of goodwill
during a visit to Taipei last month by China's top negotiator on Taiwan,
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait ( ARATS) President Chen
Yunlin.</P>
      <P>According to an agreement signed during the visit by Chen and his Taiwanese
counterpart Chiang, Taiwan will give Beijing a pair of Formosan sika deer and a
pair of Formosan serow, a goat-like mammal, in return for the pandas.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday the recent opening of direct transport and
postal links between Taiwan and China symbolizes the pursuit of peace by the two
sides, and has nothing to do with the issue of unification versus independence.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, avoiding the use of non-peaceful means to resolve conflicts is
a global trend, and the opening of the links Monday was consistent with such a
trend.</P>
      <P>The greatest significance of the links lies in the narrowing of the distance
across the Taiwan Strait, which enables the two sides to put themselves in each
other's shoes, instead of sticking to their own positions, Ma said.</P>
      <P>This was demonstrated in the recent establishment of air, shipping and postal
agreements between the two sides, which involved a great deal of give-and-take
by either side, he said.</P>
      <P>The president said although the opening of cross-strait links represents the
mainstream opinion in Taiwan, the government will respect other non-mainstream
opinions and improve any flaws in implementing the measures.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during an interview with Hakka Television Service, which
focused on the 20th anniversary of a movement by the Hakka community to fight
for its right to use its mother tongue.</P>
      <P>Ma said the movement was very meaningful because it was an action by the Hakka
people to uphold their rights and cultural heritage and led Taiwan toward a
multi-cultural society.</P>
      <P>On the plan to enact a basic Hakka law, Ma said he believes the law would help
enhance ethnic assimilation but he does not think it should set a fixed quota
for Hakka politicians in elected bodies.</P>
      <P>He said his campaign promise to set up a national Hakka radio station is
temporarily unattainable due to problems involving radio channel distribution,
but that the Council for Hakka Affairs will continue to work on the matter.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Fruit growers in southern Taiwan prefer mini links</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Balking at an assumption that the direct air and shipping links between Taiwan
and China would be a boon to Taiwan's farmers, some fruit growers in southern
Taiwan said they still prefer the mini links over the direct links.</P>
      <P>Huang Cheng-ching, chief delegate of Yuching township's farmers association in
southern Taiwan's Tainan County, said the mini links still serve their best
interest in transporting farm produce to China, despite the long-expected launch
of direct daily charter flights and direct shipping and postal deliveries across
the Taiwan Strait Monday.</P>
      <P>The mini links refer to the shipping links set up between Taiwan's outlying
Kinmen and Matsu islands and the ports of Xiamen and Mawei in China's Fujian
Province since January 2001. They were initiated to offset the lack of such
connections between Taiwan proper and China.</P>
      <P>Currently, most Tainan-grown fruits are transported to Xiamen in Fujian Province
through the existing Kinmen-Xiamen mini links, as it is the most economical way
in terms of both travel time and shipping cost, Huang said.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, Yuching exports some 700 metric tons of fruit to Xiamen
every year.  Each container  costs around NT$60,000 (US$1,820) per each
Kaohsiung-Xiamen trip via Kinmen, while the travel time is about a day and a
half, he explained.</P>
      <P>Huang, however, pointed out that more expensive big containers would conduct the
direct cross-strait shipping service launched Monday, but at a lower frequency
because big ships would need an average of four days to become fully loaded.</P>
      <P>Agricultural officials of southeastern Taiwan's Taitung County also said that
local exporters will still use the Kinmen-Xiamen mini links in a bid to deliver
their custard apples in time to China.</P>
      <P>A trip from Taitung to Xiamen through Kinmen takes around three days and its
customs clearance process is relatively simple, they noted.</P>
      <P>Taitung agricultural authorities had announced that they would transport some
300 metric tons of custard apples to China on Dec. 18, using the newly
established direct cross-strait shipping links. Taitung sold 160 metric tons of
the fruit to China last year.</P>
      <P>Although  a trip via the direct shipping links connecting Kaohsiung  to the
Chinese side takes only two days,  Taitung agricultural officials said, local
exporters decided to opt for the Kinmen-Xiamen  mini links out of concern  over
some technical obstacles, such as a more complex customs clearance at the
Kaohsiung Port.</P>
      <P>Prior to launching the direct shipping links, President Ma Ying-jeou had said
that the links could boost Taiwanese fruit exports to China by reducing travel
time and costs, enabling fresh fruits and other agricultural products to arrive
in China in a timely manner and prolonging their shelf live.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung on Tuesday celebrated the launch of the maiden daily charter flight
destined to Hangzhou in southeastern China, with officials hailing the new route
and hoping it will spur more passenger arrivals in the southern city.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung-Hangzhou flight, operated by Taipei-based TransAsia Airways, took
off from Kaohsiung International Airport at 8 a.m., with 150 passengers on board
the Airbus A-320 aircraft.</P>
      <P>The plane was scheduled to arrive in Hangzhou after a two-hour flight. It was
then to return to Kaohsiung at around 1 p.m. the same day,  carrying 65
passengers,  including 45 Chinese nationals, according to the carrier.</P>
      <P>A ceremony was held at Gate 23 to celebrate the new flight, with Kaohsiung Mayor
Chen Chu, Kaohsiung Association of Travel Agents Chairman Lin Shang-chih,
TransAsia Chairman Chen Che-hsiung, and Kaohsiung International Airport Director
Chao Jen-kang in attendance.</P>
      <P>The mayor said she was happy to see the launch of daily direct cross-strait
charter flights -- an outgrowth of the weekend charter services between Taiwan
and China that had been offered since July.</P>
      <P>She noted, however, that fewer passengers were arriving in Taiwan from China
than traveling to the mainland, an indication that the number of Chinese
visitors was not as high as had been expected when Taiwan opened its doors wider
to tourists from China in July.</P>
      <P>Chen Chu expressed the hope that Chinese authorities will lift all restrictions
on visits by Chinese citizens to Taiwan, including easing the ban on individual
visits and abolishing the rule that citizens from only 13 of China's 31
provinces can travel to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen urged China to allow its people greater freedom to see the island, and
voiced the expectation that the daily nonstop charter flights launched from her
city will attract more Chinese visitors and trade opportunities.</P>
      <P>Besides TransAsia, other two Taiwanese carriers, UNI Airways and China Airlines
(CAL) , will also offer daily direct charter flight services from Kaohsiung to
destinations in China.</P>
      <P>UNI Airways will fly between Kaohsiung and Shenzhen beginning Dec. 19 while CAL
will fly to Shanghai from Dec. 20. The flights will all take off from Kaohsiung
International Airport.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's fishing quota for bigeye tuna in the Pacific Ocean will be cut by 10
percent next year after an Pacific Ocean tuna commission called on 25 of its
members to slash bigeye tuna catches by 30 percent over the next three years,
Taiwan's Fisheries Agency announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The new quota, proposed by the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries
Commission's (WCPFC's) science sub-commission in an effort to maintain the
sustainability of the threatened species, was approved at the WCPFC's annual
meeting in South Korea's Busan Dec. 8-12, according to the agency.</P>
      <P>The sub-commission proposed a similar measure in 2006, at the time calling for a
25 percent reduction in catches, but it was rejected by WCPFC members.</P>
      <P>Under the new measure, members of the WCPFC, including Taiwan and Japan, would
work to reduce their catches of bigeye tuna by 30 percent between 2009 and 2011.</P>
      <P>To comply with the agreement, Taiwan will lower its 2009 fishing quota to 14,269
tons from 15,854 tons this year, said Tsay Tzu-yaw, deputy director-general of
the Fisheries Agency.</P>
      <P>The fishing quotas for 2010 and 2011 will be decided after the effectiveness of
the implementation of the lower quota has been evaluated, he added.</P>
      <P>Given that Taiwan currently has 50 deep sea fishing vessels, each fishing vessel
will have to cut its catch of bigeye tuna by 20-30 tons in 2009 for Taiwan to
meet the goal, Tsay estimated.</P>
      <P>At present, almost all bigeye tuna caught by Taiwan's fishing boats are exported
to Japan at a price of approximately 700-900 Japanese yen per kilogram, Tsay
said.</P>
      <P>One of the ways the commission will monitor the agreement is through a new
satellite-linked vessel monitoring system (VMS).</P>
      <P>Under the measure, all fishing vessels belonging to its members are being asked
to install the system by April 2009 so that the WCPFC will be able to monitor
vessels, including whether they intrude into the territorial waters of other
countries, according to Tsay.</P>
      <P>He added that a Regional Observer Program under the auspices of the WCPFC is
also in place. By 2012, 5 percent of the fishing vessels will need to be manned
by observers to supervise their fishing operations in waters under the
jurisdiction of the WCPFC, Tsay said.</P>

      <P>A total of 3,965 athletes from 81 countries will compete in the 21st Summer
Deaflympics to be hosted by Taipei City, a Taipei Organizing Committee executive
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to Lin Kuo-juei, chief executive officer of the committee, the event
will take place at different venues in Taipei Sept. 5-15 next year, covering 20
events, with judo, karate and taekwondo included.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will enter 164 deaf athletes -- 107 men and 57 women -- to vie for medals
in 16 disciplines, Lin said.</P>
      <P>In order to provide better reception and translation services for the athletes
and officials who will be arriving from around the world, the committee has
recruited 2,801 volunteer staffers who are being trained in international sign
language at Taipei Municipal University of Education and National Taipei
University of Education.</P>
      <P>According to Lu Tzu-yi, the committee's international affairs section chief, the
volunteers are also being coached in international sports event etiquette, as
well as the rules and regulations of the various sports involved.</P>
      <P>The committee will recruit another 50 foreign volunteer staffers who speak
English and who can communicate in sign language, and will also convene a group
of higher-level sign language translators for special translation needs, Lu
said.</P>
      <P>Another committee executive noted that as Deaflympians cannot be guided by
starter's guns, bullhorn commands or whistles, referees or umpires' instructions
will be delivered via light signals, gestures and flags.</P>
      <P>The Deaflympics was sanctioned by the International Olympic Committee and has
been organized by the International Committee of Sports for the Deaf since 1924.</P>
      <P>The event is held every four years, and athletes who qualify for the games have
to have moderate hearing loss of at least 55 decibels in their better ear.
Hearing aids or cochlear implants are not allowed to be used in competition.</P>
      <P>The last Deaflympics was held in Melbourne in 2005, and the next one will be
held in Athens in 2013.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Yacht builders eye Chinese market with expanded bilateral links</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With Taiwan recently opening its doors wider to cross-Taiwan Strait air and
marine transport, local yacht builders are optimistic about their business
development, expecting a surge in growth if the existing restrictions on yacht
traffic between Taiwan and China are relaxed.</P>
      <P>The country's yacht industry began prospering in the 1980s, with an annual
output of around 2,000 boats. This output, seen as large in those days, cannot
compare, however, with the current scale, Taiwan Yacht Industry Association
Chief Executive Director Chang Hsueh-chiao said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Over the years, Chang noted, the sector, which has spared no efforts to stay
abreast of technological progress, has won many U.S. and European orders thanks
to its customer-oriented services. Annual exports have reached NT$20 billion
(US$606.89 million), Chang said, attributing the achievement to the low cost and
high quality of Taiwan-built yachts.</P>
      <P>This year, Taiwan's yacht-building industry has been affected by the global
recession, along with many other manufacturing sectors in the country, and
orders stopped coming in the fourth quarter of the year, Chang said.</P>
      <P>While most local builders are still holding orders for next year, it will be
difficult for them to remain in business after 2009 if the recession continues,
he predicted.</P>
      <P>However, with the opening of direct transport links between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait, some local yacht builders are eyeing the emerging market in
China, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Association Chairman Chen Chao-nan said yachts are safer than the fishing boats
that local people usually charter for recreational sea trips and that Taiwanese
builders are very capable in their construction abilities.</P>
      <P>So long as the government further opens its doors to cross-strait yacht
services, the demand for Taiwan-built yachts will increase, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The long-expected daily cross-strait charter flight services, along with direct
marine transport services, began a day earlier, opening a new chapter in the
history of cross-strait exchanges.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VP: Government to help establish a creative cultural industry</HEADLINE>

(By Luis Yu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew said Tuesday that the government will help establish
a creative cultural industry in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>By creative cultural industry, Siew means an industry which focuses on turning
creative ideas such as on arts, fashion, design, into products or services that
companies can sell and Taiwan can export to other countries.</P>
      <P>"It's good to invest in the creative cultural industry when the economy is bad",
said Siew. "We have to combine bright and creative minds with money. ... It was
what we did when we built the Hsinchu Science Park 30 years ago."</P>
      <P>He was referring to the then government's investment in building Taiwan's high-
technology sector, which has contributed to rapid economic growth for the
island.</P>
      <P>Unlike  the technology  industry,  Siew said,  creating  a creative cultural
industry does not require huge amounts of capital.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks during the 5th Annual Assembly of the Magazine Business
Association of Taipei (MBAT), which took place at Huashan Cultural Park in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>Establishing a creative cultural industry and a digital contents industry is
part of a six-year national development plan called "Challenges 2008", which the
Executive Yuan (Cabinet) has been trying to implement.</P>
      <P>According to the speaker of the MBAT, Wang Jung-wen, the Taiwanese magazine
industry is best suited for the mission, followed by the pop music industry and
the on-line games industry, which have a combined output of NT$85 billion and
unlimited future potential.</P>
      <P>"For this reason, the MBAT has been encouraging its members to actively
participate in related programs, hoping to bring about a bright future for the
industry by improving the business climate, upgrading the standards, and
enhancing the economic strength of the Taiwanese creative cultural industry",
noted Wang.</P>
      <P>Siew said people with bright minds and ideas do not necessarily have the money
that is needed to establish a new industry, and people with money do not
necessarily have creative minds.</P>
      <P>"It is vital to turn great ideas into policies and policies into action", noted
the vice president.</P>
      <P>Siew said Taiwan still has a long way to go before it can succeed in
establishing a creative cultural industry, but that the government will continue
to provide incentives and assistance to those who are willing to participate in
the establishment of such an industry.</P>
      <P>Founded on Dec. 18, 1996, the MBAT is the only association of its kind in
Taiwan. It currently has about 300 members, with a combined strength of more
than 400 magazines.</P>

    <HEADLINE>`Face the law,' DPP lawmaker tells indicted former first lady</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A lawmaker of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Tuesday
that the indicted members of the former first family, especially former first
lady Wu Shu-jen, should "face the law, instead of telling more lies and fooling
around with the feelings" of DPP members.</P>
      <P>Legislator  Chiu Yi-ying,  a former staunch  supporter  of ex-President Chen
Shui-bian and the first family, made the blunt remarks after media reports said
that Chen had criticized former Minister of the Interior Yu Cheng-hsien -- a
defendant in one of the corruption cases for which Chen was indicted -- for
"confessing everything" regarding a corruption case to the prosecutors "after
being held in custody for a couple of days."</P>
      <P>Chiu said Yu did not deserve the indictment. "Had it not been for Wu Shu-jen's
pressure, he would not have risked breaking the law."</P>
      <P>She said Yu had complained to her that all the other defendants in the case were
dividing bribe money among themselves, while he alone received nothing but a
jail term.</P>
      <P>"If they did do anything wrong, no one would believe Yu's confession anyway. The
confession was important to the prosecutors because they had already obtained
other evidence in the case," Chiu said.</P>
      <P>Yu was one of 10 defendants indicted by the Special Investigation Division under
the Supreme Prosecutors Office last week along with four members of the former
first family -- Chen Shui-bian, his wife, son and daughter-in-law -- who are
facing charges of corruption, money laundering and forgery relating to four
cases.</P>
      <P>The corruption charge against Yu had to do with a scandal involving the
construction of the Nankang Exhibition Hall in Taipei in September 2003.</P>
      <P>In the written indictment, Yu was quoted as saying that Wu had instructed him to
pass the name list of a supervisory panel to contractor Kuo Chuan-ching,
president of the Rich Construction Co.</P>
      <P>Kuo, who was also indicted, has confessed that he paid Wu NT$90 million (US$2.73
million)  through her special assistant  Tsai Ming-che, along with NT$10 million
commission to Tsai and NT$1 million each to seven members of the supervisory
panel, in order to secure the NT$3.59 billion construction contract.</P>
      <P>Yu, who was released Nov. 27 on NT$1 million bail after being held in custody
for 43 days, claimed that he merely did a job for Wu and accepted no bribes. Kuo
was also released on NT$1 million bail that same day.</P>
      <P>Tsai was released on NT$3 million bail after he admitted that the bribe money
was wired to a bank account owned by his sister in the United States before
being transferred to a bank account of a member of the former first family.</P>
      <P>In the indictment, the prosecutors sought the "harshest" penalty for the former
president, and "heavy" penalties for the other three members of the former first
family, while recommending to the court that sentences for Yu, Kuo and Tsai be
commuted in consideration of the fact that they were fully cooperative during
the investigation.</P>
      <P>Also indicted were seven university professors who served on the supervisory
panel, all of whom have been released on bail. The prosecutors have asked that
they be given the maximum possible penalties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S scholar urges flexibility on visits by Taiwan's top leaders</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An American expert on Chinese law, who is also known as former mentor of
President Ma Ying-jeou, called Tuesday for China to "show more flexibility" on
the matter of visits to the United States by Taiwanese presidents.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Central News Agency in Taipei, Professor Jerome A.
Cohen, co-director of New York University's U.S.-Asia Law Institute, suggested
that China stop objecting to visits to the U.S. by Taiwan's highest-level
officials, such as the president, vice president and premier, in reciprocation
of Ma's recent efforts to improve cross-Taiwan Strait ties.</P>
      <P>Cohen said he invited Ma, during a meeting earlier in the day, to give a speech
at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York and that he hoped that Beijing
officials would consider not issuing a protest.</P>
      <P>Cohen noted that China is gradually responding to Ma's gestures of goodwill by
indicating, for example, that Taiwan's participation in the World Health
Assembly (WHA) will be negotiable. The next " possible step" for China could be
to "expand its appreciation" for Ma's efforts to foster better cross-strait
relations, he added.</P>
      <P>The president has shown interest in the invitation, Cohen said, adding that both
of them, however, acknowledged that a U.S. visit by Ma would be difficult for
the time being due to China's obstruction and the U.S.' restrictions.</P>
      <P>Cohen is known to have been the mentor of President Ma during the latter's study
at Harvard Law School in the U.S. in the early 1980s.</P>
      <P>In issuing his invitation for Ma to visit New York, Cohen also called for the
U.S. government to amend its current rule against allowing Taiwan leaders to
travel to that country for public purposes, arguing that it deprives American
audiences of their right to information.</P>
      <P>As the cross-strait issue involves U.S. national security, Americans have the
right to learn about the Taiwan situation in face-to-face exchanges with
Taiwan's leaders as a form of freedom of speech, and this has nothing to do with
formal diplomatic protocol, he contended.</P>
      <P>Since the U.S. severed diplomatic relations with the Republic of China (R.O.C.)
in 1979, R.O.C. presidents have been prohibited from conducting official visits
to the U.S. but are allowed to make transit stops there en route to other
destinations.</P>

      <P>The number of babies born in Taiwan with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is
declining, with statistics showing that since 2007 there have been no recorded
births of HIV-infected infants, the Department of Health reported (DOH) Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the DOH statistics, Taiwan recorded five cases of babies born with
HIV in 2005, and four in 2006. As of Nov. 30 this year, the number of children
in Taiwan born with HIV stood at 27, the DOH figures showed.</P>
      <P>The DOH in 2005 implemented a number of measures to stem mother-to-infant HIV
transmission during pregnancy. The measures focused on three major areas --
disease screening, medical treatment and health care.</P>
      <P>As a result, since 2005, 95 babies born to HIV-positive mothers have tested free
of the disease, the DOH said.</P>
      <P>The department estimates that the risk of mother-to-infant HIV transmission
during pregnancy will drop from 45 percent to 2 percent if the mothers adopt
preventive medical care.</P>
      <P>HIV is transmitted to infants mainly at conception, during labor or by breast
feeding. Preventive therapy during these phrases can prevent infection of
babies, DOH officials said.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung city government is working on a plan to entice people to spend
their NT$3,600 consumption vouchers -- to be issued by the central government to
boost the retail market -- in the southern port city next month.</P>
      <P>Liu xin-zheng, director of the city's Economic Affairs Bureau, said the city
government is working with nearly 1,000 stores in 18 of the city's favorite
shopping areas to issue billions of new Taiwan dollars-worth of discount coupons
for consumers who decide to spend their consumption vouchers there.</P>
      <P>Liu pointed out that the 1.5 million people in Kaohsiung, the second-largest
city in Taiwan, will have NT$5.4 billion-worth of consumption vouchers to spend
from Jan. 28.</P>
      <P>He said discount coupon booklets  will be distributed  at department stores,
airports,  train stations and scenic spots frequented by tourists to encourage
people to spend their vouchers in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The stores participating in the program will include all kinds of businesses,
and shoppers who use their consumption vouchers in conjunction with the coupons
will be able to see the value of their vouchers more than double, according to
Liu.</P>
      <P>The central government's NT$85.7 billion (US$2.6 billion) budget plan to fund
the shopping voucher program is aimed at stimulating the slumping retail sector
and boosting the overall economy.</P>
      <P>The legislature adopted a bill in early December, authorizing the government to
issue the NT$3,600 (US$108) in consumption vouchers to each Taiwanese citizen,
foreign spouses of Taiwanese citizens and infants born before the end of March
2009.</P>
      <P>The vouchers are expected to be distributed from Jan. 18 -- a week before the
Lunar New Year holiday. They will remain valid until Sept. 30 and retailers must
claim reimbursement for the vouchers by Oct. 31, 2009.</P>

Dec. 23, a spokesman for EVA Airways -- which will bring the animals from China
-- said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Nieh Kuo-wei said an EVA plane will leave for Chengdu in western China's Sichuan
Province Dec. 22 and return the next day with the pandas, whose arrivals have
been long-awaited in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The pandas will be accompanied by its two Chinese keepers, who will bring with
them 600 kg of the bamboo on which the animals feed and will stay in Taiwan for
two months to help take care of them.</P>
      <P>The spokesman also said EVA Airways is offering 100 people the "privilege of
traveling with the pandas" for just NT$9,900 for the round trip to Chengdu.</P>
      <P>After arriving in Taiwan, the pandas will be put in quarantine until they are

      <P>Chinese  President  Hu  Jintao  presented  the  pandas  to then-Kuomintang

      <P>The Special Investigation Division (SID) under the Supreme Prosecutors Office
filed an appeal Tuesday against the Taipei District Court's decision last week
to release indicted former President Chen Shui-bian, contending that it is
possible that he might abscond through "secret channels."</P>
      <P>Chen was released Dec. 13 upon his own recognizance, despite a request by
prosecutors to keep him in custody, after being detained for 32 days as
prosecutors prepared four cases against him. After four months of
investigations, they indicted him Dec. 12 on charges of embezzlement, bribe-
taking and money laundering.</P>
      <P>In the appeal presented to the Taiwan High Court, the SID prosecutors said they
will soon begin to investigate several other corruption cases involving Chen and
his wife, and that if he is allowed to remain free, some of the witnesses,
including former Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General Ma Yung-cheng,
might not dare tell the truth.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors also said they still need to trace NT$570 million (US$17.29
million) in bribe money and that if Chen is not detained, he could obliterate
the evidence, as he tried to do before he was detained.</P>
      <P>"With NT$570 million stashed abroad, it is hard to say there is absolutely no
possibility that he will abscond," they pointed out.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors noted that in the initial stage of their investigation, Chen had
instructed his former cashier, Chen Chen-hui, former Presidential Office
Director Lin Teh-hsun, Ma and other defendants to give false testimony regarding
the former first family's embezzlement of the president's state affairs fund and
its money laundering activities.</P>
      <P>The presiding judge who ordered the release of the former president apparently
ignored his proclivity to collude with other defendants and witnesses, they
said.</P>
      <P>It was also impractical for the judge to claim that Chen's activities would be
monitored by the bodyguards assigned to protect him, because he could always
instruct them not to follow him around, they added.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors cited cases in Ukraine, Peru and Thailand in which corrupt heads
of state easily sneaked out of their own countries to go into hiding abroad.</P>
      <P>The former president and his wife were indicted for embezzled NT$104 million
(US$3.12 million)  from the president's special discretionary fund during his
presidency from 2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>They also took bribes worth NT$100 million and NT$200 million in connection with
a land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million in kickbacks to help a
contractor win the tender for a government construction project, according to
the indictment.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors recommended that the former president be given the harshest
possible sentence for his alleged illegalities involving nearly half a billion
new Taiwan dollars.</P>
      <P>They also demanded severe penalties for his wife, son and daughter-in-law for
their "unrepentant attitude" in the course of investigations, while recommending
commuted sentences for 10 other defendants because they had been cooperative and
helpful in the process of the investigations.</P>

      <P>The Tainan Science Park has plumped up the coffers of Tainan County in southern
Taiwan with tax revenue since the park began operations in 1999, a local
official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the official of Tainan County's Local Tax Bureau, the house tax
revenues from the science park totalled NT$290 million (US$8.79 million) this
year compared to less than NT$2 million in 1999.</P>
      <P>House tax revenues from throughout the entire county increased from NT$1.78
billion in 1999 to NT$2.39 billion this year, the official said.</P>
      <P>Over the same period, the science park generated NT$40 million in land value tax
for the county, the official added.</P>
      <P>The science park, along with the county's many industrial areas, has also helped
to create job opportunities, the official said, adding that most of the science
park's 50,000 workers are local residents.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the operations of the science park and industrial areas have also
helped to boost development of other industries in the county, the official
said.</P>
      <P>The county's business sales from all its industries increased from NT$812.2
billion in 2002 to NT$1.6 trillion at the end of 2007, the official said.</P>
      <P>However, the actual amount is likely to be higher than the recorded figure, as
the business sales of 65 of the 167 enterprises in mass production in the park
are not registered in the county, the official added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Time not ripe for intermediary bodies to exchange offices: MAC chief</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Dec. 16 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although the long-expected direct air, shipping and postal links between Taiwan
and China were put in place Monday, hurdles remain to be surmounted before the
intermediary bodies of the two sides will be able to exchange offices, Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"The MAC hopes to gradually achieve the goal through increasing two-way
interactions, systematic negotiations and building mutual trust, but will never
exchange Taiwan's national sovereignty for economic benefits," said Lai.</P>
      <P>"In contrast, it will further highlight Taiwan's independent sovereignty from
China and set the stage for the two sides to conduct negotiations on an equal
footing," she said.</P>
      <P>The MAC chairwoman, Taiwan's top China policy planner, made the remarks while
explaining the government's cross-Taiwan Strait policy at a public meeting in
southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait relations entered a new era in which Taiwan and China will not deny
the other side's existence after a historic meeting between Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) President Chen Yunlin in early November in Taipei,
Lai said.</P>
      <P>In a follow-up to their first-ever encounter in June in Beijing, Chiang and Chen
inked four pacts during their second meeting in Taipei, agreeing to establish
direct daily charter flights, open shipping and postal services and set up a
reporting mechanism on food safety control.</P>
      <P>The meeting means that China does not deny Taiwan's existence, which is an
improvement from the past, when the two sides did not recognize each other and
when cross-strait exchanges were restricted, Lai pointed out.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are semi-official bodies authorized by Taipei and Beijing,
respectively, to handle cross-strait interaction in the absence of official
contact between the two sides. The MAC oversees SEF operations.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan-China trade totaled over US$130 billion last year, the government
needs an effective mechanism to help Taiwan's people resolve their problems
arising from two-way dealings and to guarantee fair negotiations between the two
sides, she said.</P>
      <P>Through the systematic SEF-ARATS negotiations, the government is poised to
further strengthen Taiwan's sovereignty in a gradual fashion instead of in a
reckless manner, Lai went on.</P>
      <P>Chiang and Chen are slated to discuss issues relating to joint crime-fighting
efforts, fishery cooperation, cross-strait financial supervision, and the
signing of an accord to protect Taiwanese business interests in China during the
third round of their talks scheduled for next spring, she added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. expert praises independence of Taiwan's prosecutors</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An American law expert said Tuesday that he is reassured by the independence of
Taiwan's prosecution authorities and expressed the hope that the indictment of
former President Chen Shui-bian will serve as an opportunity for the country to
strengthen its judicial system and democratic processes.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Central News Agency, visiting professor Jerome A.
Cohen, co-director of New York University's U.S.-Asia Law Institute, said that
the independence of Taiwan's prosecutors and courts is evidenced by the fact
that they received "pressure from all over, " including from the ruling
Kuomintang and the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), in the probes
into the Chen family cases.</P>
      <P>This level of judicial independence has been one of Taiwan's significant
achievements since the early 1990s, he added. Cohen said that in recent years,
he has thought that "Taiwan's prosecutors are able and honest people who are not
told what to do by the president, or by the Ministry of Justice, or by the
Cabinet."</P>
      <P>However, Cohen said that the indictment of Chen and his family members on
various charges such as corruption and embezzlement is a "personal and political
tragedy," and is also "horrible for the DPP."</P>
      <P>Cohen suggested that whatever the outcome of the cases, Taiwan should "turn a
vice into a virtue" and seize the opportunity to create "something worthwhile, "
such as a better judiciary and democracy.</P>
      <P>It will also be important for Taiwan in the next ten years to deal with problems
regarding criminal justice, he noted.</P>
      <P>In addition, Cohen said although Taiwan "is doing a good job" in democratic
practices, its people still face challenges such as how to strengthen government
institutions and to maintain a responsible two-party political system. "To be a
Taiwan citizen now is exciting, but also a pretty heavy responsibility," he
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Number of babies in Taiwan born with HIV declining</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of babies born in Taiwan with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is
declining, with statistics showing that since 2007 there have been no recorded
births of HIV-infected infants, the Department of Health reported (DOH) Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the DOH statistics, Taiwan recorded five cases of babies born with
HIV in 2005, and four in 2006. As of Nov. 30 this year, the number of children
in Taiwan born with HIV stood at 27, the DOH figures showed.</P>
      <P>The DOH in 2005 implemented a number of measures to stem mother-to-infant HIV
transmission during pregnancy. The measures focused on three major areas --
disease screening, medical treatment and health care.</P>
      <P>As a result, since 2005, 95 babies born to HIV-positive mothers have tested free
of the disease, the DOH said.</P>
      <P>The department estimates that the risk of mother-to-infant HIV transmission
during pregnancy will drop from 45 percent to 2 percent if the mothers adopt
preventive medical care.</P>
      <P>HIV is transmitted to infants mainly at conception, during labor or by breast
feeding. Preventive therapy during these phrases can prevent infection of
babies, DOH officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Kaohsiung hoping to attract shopping voucher spenders with discounts</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government is working on a plan to entice people to spend
their NT$3,600 consumption vouchers -- to be issued by the central government to
boost the retail market -- in the southern port city next month.</P>
      <P>Liu xin-zheng, director of the city's Economic Affairs Bureau, said the city
government is working with nearly 1,000 stores in 18 of the city's favorite
shopping areas to issue billions of new Taiwan dollars-worth of discount coupons
for consumers who decide to spend their consumption vouchers there.</P>
      <P>Liu pointed out that the 1.5 million people in Kaohsiung, the second-largest
city in Taiwan, will have NT$5.4 billion-worth of consumption vouchers to spend
from Jan. 28.</P>
      <P>He said discount coupon booklets  will be distributed  at department stores,
airports,  train stations and scenic spots frequented by tourists to encourage
people to spend their vouchers in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The stores participating in the program will include all kinds of businesses,
and shoppers who use their consumption vouchers in conjunction with the coupons
will be able to see the value of their vouchers more than double, according to
Liu.</P>
      <P>The central government's NT$85.7 billion (US$2.6 billion) budget plan to fund
the shopping voucher program is aimed at stimulating the slumping retail sector
and boosting the overall economy.</P>
      <P>The legislature adopted a bill in early December, authorizing the government to
issue the NT$3,600 (US$108) in consumption vouchers to each Taiwanese citizen,
foreign spouses of Taiwanese citizens and infants born before the end of March
2009.</P>
      <P>The vouchers are expected to be distributed from Jan. 18 -- a week before the
Lunar New Year holiday. They will remain valid until Sept. 30 and retailers must
claim reimbursement for the vouchers by Oct. 31, 2009.</P>

      <P>A pair of giant pandas China promised to give Taiwan in 2005 will finally arrive
Dec. 23, a spokesman for EVA Airways -- which will bring the animals from China
-- said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Nieh Kuo-wei said an EVA plane will leave for Chengdu in western China's Sichuan
Province Dec. 22 and return the next day with the pandas, whose arrivals have
been long-awaited in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The pandas will be accompanied by its two Chinese keepers, who will bring with
them 600 kg of the bamboo on which the animals feed and will stay in Taiwan for
two months to help take care of them.</P>
      <P>The spokesman also said EVA Airways is offering 100 people the "privilege of
traveling with the pandas" for just NT$9,900 for the round trip to Chengdu.</P>
      <P>After arriving in Taiwan, the pandas will be put in quarantine until they are
put on display at the Taipei Zoo for the first time on Lunar New Year's Eve --
Jan. 25.</P>
      <P>Chinese  President  Hu  Jintao  presented  the  pandas  to then-Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan in 2005 during an ice-breaking trip Lien made to Beijing, but
the delivery was blocked by political bickering between Beijing and Taipei as
long as Taiwan was under the rule of the now-opposition Democratic Progressive
Party.</P>
      <P>However, the political climate between the two sides has thawed since President
Ma Ying-jeou took office in May this year, thanks to Ma's more conciliatory
approach toward China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Prosecutors file appeal against ex-president's release</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Special Investigation Division (SID) under the Supreme Prosecutors Office
filed an appeal Tuesday against the Taipei District Court's decision last week
to release indicted former President Chen Shui-bian, contending that it is
possible that he might abscond through "secret channels."</P>
      <P>Chen was released Dec. 13 upon his own recognizance, despite a request by
prosecutors to keep him in custody, after being detained for 32 days as
prosecutors prepared four cases against him. After four months of
investigations, they indicted him Dec. 12 on charges of embezzlement, bribe-
taking and money laundering.</P>
      <P>In the appeal presented to the Taiwan High Court, the SID prosecutors said they
will soon begin to investigate several other corruption cases involving Chen and
his wife, and that if he is allowed to remain free, some of the witnesses,
including former Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General Ma Yung-cheng,
might not dare tell the truth.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors also said they still need to trace NT$570 million (US$17.29
million) in bribe money and that if Chen is not detained, he could obliterate
the evidence, as he tried to do before he was detained.</P>
      <P>"With NT$570 million stashed abroad, it is hard to say there is absolutely no
possibility that he will abscond," they pointed out.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors noted that in the initial stage of their investigation, Chen had
instructed his former cashier, Chen Chen-hui, former Presidential Office
Director Lin Teh-hsun, Ma and other defendants to give false testimony regarding
the former first family's embezzlement of the president's state affairs fund and
its money laundering activities.</P>
      <P>The presiding judge who ordered the release of the former president apparently
ignored his proclivity to collude with other defendants and witnesses, they
said.</P>
      <P>It was also impractical for the judge to claim that Chen's activities would be
monitored by the bodyguards assigned to protect him, because he could always
instruct them not to follow him around, they added.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors cited cases in Ukraine, Peru and Thailand in which corrupt heads
of state easily sneaked out of their own countries to go into hiding abroad.</P>
      <P>The former president and his wife were indicted for embezzled NT$104 million
(US$3.12 million)  from the president's special discretionary fund during his
presidency from 2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>They also took bribes worth NT$100 million and NT$200 million in connection with
a land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million in kickbacks to help a
contractor win the tender for a government construction project, according to
the indictment.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors recommended that the former president be given the harshest
possible sentence for his alleged illegalities involving nearly half a billion
new Taiwan dollars.</P>
      <P>They also demanded severe penalties for his wife, son and daughter-in-law for
their "unrepentant attitude" in the course of investigations, while recommending
commuted sentences for 10 other defendants because they had been cooperative and
helpful in the process of the investigations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tainan County sees increased tax revenue from science park</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Tainan Science Park has plumped up the coffers of Tainan County in southern
Taiwan with tax revenue since the park began operations in 1999, a local
official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the official of Tainan County's Local Tax Bureau, the house tax
revenues from the science park totalled NT$290 million (US$8.79 million) this
year compared to less than NT$2 million in 1999.</P>
      <P>House tax revenues from throughout the entire county increased from NT$1.78
billion in 1999 to NT$2.39 billion this year, the official said.</P>
      <P>Over the same period, the science park generated NT$40 million in land value tax
for the county, the official added.</P>
      <P>The science park, along with the county's many industrial areas, has also helped
to create job opportunities, the official said, adding that most of the science
park's 50,000 workers are local residents.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the operations of the science park and industrial areas have also
helped to boost development of other industries in the county, the official
said.</P>
      <P>The county's business sales from all its industries increased from NT$812.2
billion in 2002 to NT$1.6 trillion at the end of 2007, the official said.</P>
      <P>However, the actual amount is likely to be higher than the recorded figure, as
the business sales of 65 of the 167 enterprises in mass production in the park
are not registered in the county, the official added.</P>

      <P>The number of babies born in Taiwan with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is
declining, with statistics showing that since 2007 there have been no recorded
births of HIV-infected infants, the Department of Health reported (DOH) Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the DOH statistics, Taiwan recorded five cases of babies born with
HIV in 2005, and four in 2006. As of Nov. 30 this year, the number of children
in Taiwan born with HIV stood at 27, the DOH figures showed.</P>
      <P>The DOH in 2005 implemented a number of measures to stem mother-to-infant HIV
transmission during pregnancy. The measures focused on three major areas --
disease screening, medical treatment and health care.</P>
      <P>As a result, since 2005, 95 babies born to HIV-positive mothers have tested free
of the disease, the DOH said.</P>
      <P>The department estimates that the risk of mother-to-infant HIV transmission
during pregnancy will drop from 45 percent to 2 percent if the mothers adopt
preventive medical care.</P>
      <P>HIV is transmitted to infants mainly at conception, during labor or by breast
feeding. Preventive therapy during these phrases can prevent infection of
babies, DOH officials said.</P>

      <P>A pair of giant pandas China promised to give Taiwan in 2005 will finally arrive
Dec. 23, a spokesman for EVA Airways -- which will bring the animals from China
-- said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Nieh Kuo-wei said an EVA plane will leave for Chengdu in western China's Sichuan
Province Dec. 22 and return the next day with the pandas, whose arrivals have
been long-awaited in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The pandas will be accompanied by its two Chinese keepers, who will bring with
them 600 kg of the bamboo on which the animals feed and will stay in Taiwan for
two months to help take care of them.</P>
      <P>The spokesman also said EVA Airways is offering 100 people the "privilege of
traveling with the pandas" for just NT$9,900 for the round trip to Chengdu.</P>
      <P>After arriving in Taiwan, the pandas will be put in quarantine until they are
put on display at the Taipei Zoo for the first time on Lunar New Year's Eve --
Jan. 25.</P>
      <P>Chinese  President  Hu  Jintao  presented  the  pandas  to then-Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan in 2005 during an ice-breaking trip Lien made to Beijing, but

    <HEADLINE>Prosecutors file appeal against ex-president's release</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Special Investigation Division (SID) under the Supreme Prosecutors Office
filed an appeal Tuesday against the Taipei District Court's decision last week
to release indicted former President Chen Shui-bian, contending that it is
possible that he might abscond through "secret channels."</P>
      <P>Chen was released Dec. 13 upon his own recognizance, despite a request by
prosecutors to keep him in custody, after being detained for 32 days as
prosecutors prepared four cases against him. After four months of
investigations, they indicted him Dec. 12 on charges of embezzlement, bribe-
taking and money laundering.</P>
      <P>In the appeal presented to the Taiwan High Court, the SID prosecutors said they
will soon begin to investigate several other corruption cases involving Chen and
his wife, and that if he is allowed to remain free, some of the witnesses,
including former Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General Ma Yung-cheng,
might not dare tell the truth.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors also said they still need to trace NT$570 million (US$17.29
million) in bribe money and that if Chen is not detained, he could obliterate
the evidence, as he tried to do before he was detained.</P>
      <P>"With NT$570 million stashed abroad, it is hard to say there is absolutely no
possibility that he will abscond," they pointed out.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors noted that in the initial stage of their investigation, Chen had
instructed his former cashier, Chen Chen-hui, former Presidential Office
Director Lin Teh-hsun, Ma and other defendants to give false testimony regarding
the former first family's embezzlement of the president's state affairs fund and
its money laundering activities.</P>
      <P>The presiding judge who ordered the release of the former president apparently
ignored his proclivity to collude with other defendants and witnesses, they
said.</P>
      <P>It was also impractical for the judge to claim that Chen's activities would be
monitored by the bodyguards assigned to protect him, because he could always
instruct them not to follow him around, they added.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors cited cases in Ukraine, Peru and Thailand in which corrupt heads
of state easily sneaked out of their own countries to go into hiding abroad.</P>
      <P>The former president and his wife were indicted for embezzled NT$104 million
(US$3.12 million)  from the president's special discretionary fund during his
presidency from 2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>They also took bribes worth NT$100 million and NT$200 million in connection with
a land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million in kickbacks to help a
contractor win the tender for a government construction project, according to
the indictment.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors recommended that the former president be given the harshest
possible sentence for his alleged illegalities involving nearly half a billion
new Taiwan dollars.</P>
      <P>They also demanded severe penalties for his wife, son and daughter-in-law for
their "unrepentant attitude" in the course of investigations, while recommending
commuted sentences for 10 other defendants because they had been cooperative and
helpful in the process of the investigations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Time not ripe for intermediary bodies to exchange offices: MAC chief</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Dec. 16 (CNA)
12/17/08  09:49:52
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although the long-expected direct air, shipping and postal links between Taiwan
and China were put in place Monday, hurdles remain to be surmounted before the
intermediary bodies of the two sides will be able to exchange offices, Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"The MAC hopes to gradually achieve the goal through increasing two-way
interactions, systematic negotiations and building mutual trust, but will never
exchange Taiwan's national sovereignty for economic benefits," said Lai.</P>
      <P>"In contrast, it will further highlight Taiwan's independent sovereignty from
China and set the stage for the two sides to conduct negotiations on an equal
footing," she said.</P>
      <P>The MAC chairwoman, Taiwan's top China policy planner, made the remarks while
explaining the government's cross-Taiwan Strait policy at a public meeting in
southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait relations entered a new era in which Taiwan and China will not deny
the other side's existence after a historic meeting between Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) President Chen Yunlin in early November in Taipei,
Lai said.</P>
      <P>In a follow-up to their first-ever encounter in June in Beijing, Chiang and Chen
inked four pacts during their second meeting in Taipei, agreeing to establish
direct daily charter flights, open shipping and postal services and set up a
reporting mechanism on food safety control.</P>
      <P>The meeting means that China does not deny Taiwan's existence, which is an
improvement from the past, when the two sides did not recognize each other and
when cross-strait exchanges were restricted, Lai pointed out.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are semi-official bodies authorized by Taipei and Beijing,
respectively, to handle cross-strait interaction in the absence of official
contact between the two sides. The MAC oversees SEF operations.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan-China trade totaled over US$130 billion last year, the government
needs an effective mechanism to help Taiwan's people resolve their problems
arising from two-way dealings and to guarantee fair negotiations between the two
sides, she said.</P>
      <P>Through the systematic SEF-ARATS negotiations, the government is poised to
further strengthen Taiwan's sovereignty in a gradual fashion instead of in a
reckless manner, Lai went on.</P>
      <P>Chiang and Chen are slated to discuss issues relating to joint crime-fighting
efforts, fishery cooperation, cross-strait financial supervision, and the
signing of an accord to protect Taiwanese business interests in China during the
third round of their talks scheduled for next spring, she added.</P>

(By Jian Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An American law expert said Tuesday that he is reassured by the independence of
Taiwan's prosecution authorities and expressed the hope that the indictment of
former President Chen Shui-bian will serve as an opportunity for the country to
strengthen its judicial system and democratic processes.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Central News Agency, visiting professor Jerome A.
Cohen, co-director of New York University's U.S.-Asia Law Institute, said that
the independence of Taiwan's prosecutors and courts is evidenced by the fact
that they received "pressure from all over, " including from the ruling
Kuomintang and the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), in the probes
into the Chen family cases.</P>
      <P>This level of judicial independence has been one of Taiwan's significant
achievements since the early 1990s, he added. Cohen said that in recent years,
he has thought that "Taiwan's prosecutors are able and honest people who are not
told what to do by the president, or by the Ministry of Justice, or by the
Cabinet."</P>
      <P>However, Cohen said that the indictment of Chen and his family members on
various charges such as corruption and embezzlement is a "personal and political
tragedy," and is also "horrible for the DPP."</P>
      <P>Cohen suggested that whatever the outcome of the cases, Taiwan should "turn a
vice into a virtue" and seize the opportunity to create "something worthwhile, "
such as a better judiciary and democracy.</P>
      <P>It will also be important for Taiwan in the next ten years to deal with problems
regarding criminal justice, he noted.</P>
      <P>In addition, Cohen said although Taiwan "is doing a good job" in democratic
practices, its people still face challenges such as how to strengthen government
institutions and to maintain a responsible two-party political system. "To be a
Taiwan citizen now is exciting, but also a pretty heavy responsibility," he
said.</P>

12/17/08  14:24:57

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Control Yuan censured the Department of Health (DOH) Wednesday for its
"inattentive management" of tainted dragon fruit imported from Vietnam in
October and threatened to impeach health officials if a repeat of the situation
occurred.</P>
      <P>Control Yuan members Cheng Jen-hung and Wu Feng-shan found that the DOH
neglected its duty by not establishing a mechanism to track and inspect local
fruit importers who sold tainted dragon fruit before pesticide test results were
available.</P>
      <P>Such negligence posed risks to consumers' health, the Control Yuan asserted.</P>
      <P>If similar incidents happen again in the future, we will not rule out the
possibility of impeaching DOH officials,Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The case involved more than 18,300 kilograms of dragon fruit arrived  from
Vietnam in early October.  According  to normal procedures, the DOH allowed the
importer to take possession of the fruit in exchange for a pledge it would not
sell the fruit before results of safety tests were available.</P>
      <P>Perishable goods are customarily released to local importers before final
approval is given so that they can be stored in a proper environment. The
government contends it lacks such facilities at the country's seaports and
airports.</P>
      <P>In the case of the imported dragon fruit, however, when the Bureau of Standards,
Metrology and Inspection informed the DOH a few days later that the fruit
contained excessive pesticide residues, the importer had already illegally sold
the shipment in eight counties islandwide.</P>
      <P>Cheng accused the DOH of not making sufficient efforts to establish a system
that can check, track and control foods they have let into the country prior to
their being approved.</P>
      <P>This lax control of food safety at its source, Cheng said, has resulted in a
16.7 percent rate of illegal sales from 2006 to November this year.</P>
      <P>Cheng also said the DOH has not established clear standards and test methods for
laboratories to follow, causing a delay in judging whether foods can be sold or
not.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan decision also criticized the DOH for a lack of measures and
stiff penalties to prevent illegal sales.</P>
      <P>At present, importers who sell foods before receiving approval are fined
NT$60,000 (US$1,834) and banned for six months from taking delivery of imported
goods before test results are available, penalties that Cheng described
aspointless.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan's Wu further described the dragon fruit case as onlythe tip of
iceberg,pointing out that Taiwan's budget for food safety, which is only one-
fourth that of Japan and one-fourteenth that of the United States, is "seriously
deficienct.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's main body responsible for monitoring the conduct of public officials
and civil servants, the Control Yuan resumed operations in August this year
after more than three years of paralysis.</P>

      <P>Local consumers are expected to be more practical in making purchasing decisions
in 2009 as they seek stability during the economic downturn, according to a
consumer trend report released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The report published by Eastern Online, a lifestyle and consumer market research
consultant, found that money remains at the top of local consumers' most-wanted
list, mentioned by 62.3 percent of the survey's respondents.</P>
      <P>Health and a stable life are the second and third top priorities, cited by 48.3
percent and 34.8 percent of respondents, respectively.</P>
      <P>The survey results further revealed five trends among Taiwan's consumers, led by
a more rational use of money owing to a decline in purchasing power.</P>
      <P>The survey found that the ratio of consumers who lack a clear idea of where
their money has been spent has dropped from 53.6 percent in 2007 to 32.7 percent
in 2008, while the ratio of those who put their money in education or retirement
funds has risen from 72.7 percent in 2007 to 79.4 percent in 2008.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the ratio of consumers investing in high-risk, high-return
instruments has decreased from 40.9 percent in 2007 to 30.7 percent in 2008.</P>
      <P>The second trend revealed is that the demand for fashion and quality remains
high, but not at the expense of practicality.</P>
      <P>The results indicated that 63 percent of respondents in the 20-64 age group
"would spend more for products with special style, " about the same as in 2007.</P>
      <P>However, the group of consumers who "would consider buying fashionable products
that are a bit impractical" contracted from 47.7 percent in 2007 to 33.9 percent
in 2008.</P>
      <P>Another trend identified by the survey is that consumers are less worried about
being left behind by new technologies.</P>
      <P>While 70 percent of respondents agree that mobile phones, e-mail and MSN are
important means of communications and 60.3 percent often use the Internet to
search for information, the ratio of those who are often worried about not being
up on technological developments has dropped from 59.1 percent in 2004 to 51.9
percent in 2008.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the report found that Taiwan's consumers are attaching increasing
importance to a healthy diet and paying more attention to environmental
protection.</P>
      <P>More than 84 percent of respondents said they check the list of ingredients and
dates of expiry when buying foods, and 91.9 percent said cleanliness is their
first consideration in deciding on a place to eat out.</P>
      <P>Ninety percent of respondents believe they have a responsibility to protect the
earth, and 86.5 percent are concerned that excessive consumption will lead to
the depletion of the planet's resources.</P>
      <P>The report was based on a survey of 2,000 domestic consumers aged 13-64. It had
a margin of error of 2.19 percent.</P>

tung, the city's Department of Information and Tourism, speaking by phone from
China where he is preparing for the transfer.</P>
      <P>They will arrive at around  2 p.m.  at Taiwan  Taoyuan International Airport and
are expected to reach their new home at the Taipei City Zoo by nightfall,Yang
added.</P>
      <P>He cautioned, however, that the planned schedule could be affected by a number
of factors, including the pandas' health, traffic conditions in Sichuan,  and
weather conditions at the international airport in Chengdu, Sichuan's capital.</P>
      <P>"We cannot be too optimistic about conditions on the road from the China Panda-
protection  Research  Center  in Ya'an to the international airport in Chengdu
and the weather at the airport. That's why we can't be too certain about Dec. 23
as the timing for the pandas' arrival in Taiwan,Yang said.</P>
      <P>Even if the pandas arrive here next week, they will be kept in quarantine for at
least one month before they can be exposed to the public. Zoo officials hope the
pandas can make their debut around the Lunar New Year, which falls on Jan. 26.</P>
      <P>China offered Taiwan the two pandas in 2005 when then-opposition Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan made an ice-breaking visit to Beijing.</P>
      <P>The Chinese authorities named them Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan -- which together
mean "reunion" or "unification" in Chinese -- through an online vote.</P>
      <P>The offer was turned down, however, by the then-ruling Democratic Progressive
Party administration, which objected to China's treatment of the panda transfer
as a "domestic transfer" between zoos because it implied that Taiwan was part of
China.</P>
      <P>As giant pandas are an endangered wildlife species subject to the protection of
the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and
Flora (CITES) , cross-border transfers of the animal must follow strict CITES
guidelines.</P>
      <P>According to the guidelines, the two parties must supply export and import
permits confirming that all conditions for the transfer have been met, implying
that transaction is between two countries.</P>
      <P>In contrast with the previous DPP administration, the government of President Ma
Ying-jeou  has agreed to skirt the issue by identifying the importer as " Taiwan
Taipei" and accepting "Chengdu" as the origin of export.</P>
      <P>According to an agreement signed Nov. 6 by Taiwan and China, Taiwan will give
Beijing a pair of Formosan sika deer and a pair of Formosan serow in return for
the pandas.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Labor associations demanded Wednesday that the Cabinet-level Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA) investigate unpaid leave programs that the groups charge have been
imposed by employers without the full consent of their workers.</P>
      <P>Taiwan International  Family Association  representative  Li Dan-feng said
during a protest in front of the CLA building that several members of her
association have been asked to take more than 10 days off without pay per month,
costing them more than NT$10,000 (US$306) in monthly wages and seriously
impacting their lives.</P>
      <P>Moreover, these employees are almost forced into agreeing (to the unpaid leave
terms) . They signed the agreement to be able to at least keep their jobs,Li
said.</P>
      <P>According to the CLA's Department of Labor Standards, employers who suspend
their operations or reduce production are required to pay employees in
accordance with the original employment contract.</P>
      <P>If employers want to institute an unpaid leave program, the terms must be
negotiated with their employees before any plan can take effect.</P>
      <P>CLA Minister Wang Ju-hsuan also announced Tuesday that employers must not pay
full-time employees a monthly salary less than the minimum wage of NT$17,280,
regardless of any unpaid leave scheme, to guarantee their rights.</P>
      <P>Despite the existence of these regulations, Lai Hsiang-ling, spokeswoman of the
"Raging Citizens Act Now" association, criticized the CLA's weakness in
protecting laborers' right to work, a charge supported by 50 protesters who
smashed bowls to convey that their livelihoods are at risk.</P>
      <P>She urged the CLA to investigate whether there are companies that unilaterally
announced unpaid leave programs without negotiating terms with their employees,
and whether those workers are being paid below the minimum wage.</P>
      <P>In response, CLA Deputy Minister Pan Shih-wei told reporters that the Labor
Inspection Office under the CLA will strengthen its regular checks on workers'
conditions.</P>
      <P>The labor associations also demanded that enterprises violating CLA regulations
on unpaid leave be barred from benefiting from the government's financial relief
measures.</P>
      <P>Due to the global economic downturn, many of Taiwan's leading companies,
including chipmakers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and United
Microelectronics Corporation, have implemented unpaid leave programs to reduce
personnel costs.</P>

      <P>A new concept in "vertical gardens" based on newly developed non-woven fabrics
made its debut Wednesday, introduced by the Yunlin branch of the non-profit
Taiwan Textile Research Institute (TTRI).</P>
      <P>Vertical gardens are nothing new in the world of horticulture, but the
technology using composite non-woven and cloth fabrics as a base on which plants
and flowers can grow is a new twist, said Huang Po-hsiung, deputy director of
the Product Development Department of the TTRI's Yunlin branch.</P>
      <P>The know-how and application of non-woven vertical gardens can help private
houses and public buildings build gardens in an easy, inexpensive and
environmentally friendly way, said Huang.</P>
      <P>If well cultivated, the gardens could also be used as natural coolers  of the
environment  with their strong  heat-repellent properties, Huang added.</P>
      <P>The gardens were introduced at a workshop held at the TTRI's Yunlin branch,
where other new innovative products developed by TTRI researchers were also

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several people who have been dubbed "the glory of Taiwan" by building successful
careers without acquiring tertiary education shared their life stories at a
forum held Tuesday at National Chung Cheng University in the southern county of
Chiayi.</P>
      <P>University officials said the forum and an accompanying Web site invited young
people who have won prestigious awards and acclaim in the international arena to
tell how they turned their interests into a "world number one" skill.</P>
      <P>Since 2006, the number of local people in their 20s emerging as world champions
in various international competitions has been rising, according to the
officials.</P>
      <P>Not until those people -- who were originally considered by some local people as
not being part of mainstream society -- began to shine in the world, did these
same people realize that there are different paths to success, the officials
added.</P>
      <P>Many people, however, are unaware of how those who had difficulty adapting to
the formal education system overcame their financial hardships as well as mental
suffering before they were able to attain their ultimate achievements.</P>
      <P>For example, balloon artist Chen Yi-wei, who was forced to drop out of
university in his second year because of poor grades stemming from his devotion
to art, has not only won championships in various balloon art competitions in
Japan and the United States, but also operates a booming balloon art design
consultancy that opened in 2007.</P>
      <P>Chen said that when he decided to devote his life to balloon sculptures a few
years ago, he found that the education system did provide sufficient
professional information and learning materials for him. Thus, he worked out a
solution by searching for information on the Internet, which enabled him to
develop his craft.</P>
      <P>Several international bartender competition winners who also experienced
difficulty with regular class work also shared their stories.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Mei-mei,  a coach who has trained  many world-class bartenders, said given
that Taiwan's education system does not provide educational opportunities for
students with special talents, many excellent bartenders would not be able to
shine on the international stage without the efforts of a group of enthusiastic
coaches willing to cultivate talent.</P>
      <P>Speaking of her frustration, Hsieh complained that the country has not set up a
complete system for training bartenders in international  competitions  and for
handling contestants' visa applications, adding that the lack of government
support makes the contestants' road to victory very bumpy.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Biologists at Academia Sinica have spotted "speciation" genes in budding yeasts
and have observed for the first time the mechanisms related to these genes,
according to a paper published in Dec. 12 issue of the peer-reviewed journal
Cell.</P>
      <P>Biologists have long observed that animals of different species cannot reproduce
with each other, and that even if different species do produce offspring, the
resulting hybrids are sterile.</P>
      <P>These facts have induced evolutionary biologists to hypothesize the existence of
speciation genes, a type of evolutionary divider that inhibits inter-species
reproduction.</P>
      <P>Since then, only a handful of speciation genes have been identified and most of
their molecular mechanisms are still unclear, according to Academia Sinica.</P>
      <P>However, researchers at Academia Sinica's Institute of Molecular Biology have
not only identified a pair of speciation genes in yeast, but have also come to
the realization that if the genes are passed down from different species, they
will be unable to interact with each other, leading to hybrid sterility.</P>
      <P>Leu Jun-yi -- an assistant research fellow at the institute who is leading the
project -- said they selected saccharomyces bayanus and saccharomyces
cerevisiae, which are closely related to each other in evolutionary terms, as
their experiment subjects.</P>
      <P>Although the two species do produce offspring, Leu said, the pair of speciation
genes --  Aep2 protein in nucleus and OLI1 in mitochondrion -- failed to
activate reproduction functions because one came from s. bayanus and the other
came from s. cerevisiae.</P>
      <P>"Only when both Aep2 and OLI1 come from the same species will the subsequent
mechanisms function properly," said Leu.</P>
      <P>Explaining why such a divider would exist, Leu suggested that it could be to
maintain novel adaptations during the evolutionary process.</P>
      <P>Leu elaborated by pointing out that although s. bayanus and s. cerevisiae are
closely related in evolutionary terms, one has adopted to aerobic respiration,
while the other uses anaerobic respiration. If the two species were allowed to
merge through reproduction, one of the respiration methods would disappear, said
Leu.</P>

      <P>An increasing number of children from low-income families are in need of
financial aid to continue their education, according to the findings of a survey
released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted in November on 1,234 children from poor families, showed
that 63.8 percent of the children said that they do not think they have a chance
to go on to higher education, said Wang Ming-jen, executive director of the
Taiwan Fund for Children and Families (TFCF), which conducted the survey.</P>
      <P>Survey findings also showed that many of the children were not doing well in
school, Wang told a news conference in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The TFCF survey found that 2 percent of elementary school children and 14.8
percent of junior high school children from low-income families were falling
behind in their academic studies.</P>
      <P>The survey findings suggest there is an alarming trend of increase in children
from low-income families not performing to their potential in their academic
studies, the group said.</P>
      <P>This will lead to low self-esteem for the children,Wang told reporters.</P>
      <P>The global economic crisis will only make the financial situation of the low-
income families worse, according to Wang. Companies in recent days have
announced layoffs, unpaid leave and salary freezes.</P>
      <P>This means that the children from these families will be even more depleted in
education resources,said Wang.</P>
      <P>In addition to the TFCF survey, Wang also quoted figures from the Ministry of
Interior indicating that Taiwan now has over 90,000 low-income households, a
10-year record high.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, many of these low-income families are not spending any money
on after-school tutorial education for their children.</P>
      <P>This is to the disadvantage of the children,said Wang.</P>
      <P>Low-income families are those with a monthly income of less than NT$10,000
(US$303).</P>
      <P>TFCF is a non-governmental organization that dedicates itself to helping needy
children and their families with welfare and benefits.</P>
      <P>Wang said her group is helping about 42,000 children from families of modest
means.</P>
      <P>I would like to call on the community to reach out and help those children in
need by making donations, said Wang, adding that the groups donation hotline is
0800-001-100.</P>

raised in a poultry farm in Tainan County were confirmed by a government
laboratory to have died from the H5N2 bird flu virus last month, but the Council
of Agriculture (COA) tried to conceal the information so as not to mar the
launch of direct daily air and regular shipping and postal links on Dec. 15.</P>
      <P>Chen voiced grave concern that Taiwan will be exposed to great risk if the COA
fails to fulfill its duty now that direct transport links across the Taiwan
Strait have been established.</P>
      <P>As bird flu has also broken out in Hong Kong and China recently, the COA must
quickly detect the origin of the H5N2 virus to help protect public health, Chen
said. She also demanded that COA Minister Chen Wu-hsiung step down if the
council is found to be accountable for any wrongdoing.</P>
      <P>Answering questions at the Legislative Yuan Economics Committee later that same
day, Chen Wu-hsiung again denied that large numbers of chickens have died in
Tainan County in recent months.</P>
      <P>He also rejected allegations that the COA has attempted to hide information
about a possible bird flu epidemic in southern Taiwan, stressing  that the
council will publish the results  of its investigation once it is complete.</P>
      <P>In response to media reports that bird flu had broken out in Tainan and
Kaohsiung counties, COA officials said in an urgent news conference Wednesday
morning that a joint investigation by the COA and the Tainan county authorities
has ruled out any Tainan cases.</P>
      <P>However, the officials admitted that in Luchu township in neighboring Kaohsiung
County, some 400 chickens at a poultry farm had died in late October and that
some others were found in November, although they noted that only around 3
percent of the chickens had died, a fatality rate that is within the normal
range for chicken farms and far lower than the average mortality rate caused by
the H5N2 virus.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the chickens did not develop signs of respiratory disease
-- a key symptom of an H5N2 epidemic -- animal health officials decided to cull
all the remaining 18,000 chickens in an effort to prevent any negative
consequences.</P>
      <P>The COA officials denied that the COA had tried to keep Kaohsiung's situation
secret, saying that a panel of 23 experts had still not completed an
investigation into the deaths and that the delay had nothing to do with the
opening of direct cross-Taiwan Strait transport links.</P>
      <P>Lin Ting, deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control under the
Department of Health, also pointed out at a legislative committee meeting that
day that there is no evidence the H5N2 virus can make the species jump to
humans.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's Alishan tea to get anti-forgery label to fight fakes</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17 (CNA)
12/17/08  20:03:49

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chiayi county government in southern Taiwan announced Wednesday that it has
developed an anti-forgery label for its most popular agricultural product, the
Alishan mountain oolong tea.</P>
      <P>The tea has been popular among tourists, particularly those from China who have
been coming to the mountain in larger numbers after non-stop, regular charter
flights between Taiwan and China were launched in July,  said Lien Chung-yung,
the county official responsible of agricultural affairs.</P>
      <P>However, the tea's popularity has led to forgeries which are made of substandard
tea leaves, and the substandard products are hurting the reputation of the
genuine goods, Lien said.</P>
      <P>To protect Alishan tea's fame and sales, the county government invented the
special label which can be found on the tea package. With a Q-tip and some
water, Lien said, consumers can determine whether they are purchasing the real
Alishan tea. If the label, which is blue turns pink, that means the product is
genuine.</P>
      <P>The anti-forgery  label can also help consumers trace the producer, the official
added.</P>
      <P>Alishan mountain tea is produced in the Alishan mountain area at an altitude of
at least 1,000 meters above sea level. At that altitude, tea farms are often
surrounded by mist and moist clouds in the early morning and in the evening. The
cool weather makes the area perfect for growing tea.</P>
      <P>The county, through which the Tropic of Cancer runs, has 2,300 hectares of tea
farms, which can generate an annual production value of more than NT$2 billion
(US$61.3 million), according to the county government.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan opened its doors to more mainland Chinese tourists in July, the
Alishan mountain tea has become a must-buy product, which almost every Chinese
visitor will purchase for his or her family or friends in China as gifts, Lien
said.</P>

      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) announced Wednesday that it will review its
foreign worker policies in the short term, in an effort to safeguard job
opportunities for Taiwanese workers and to ensure protection of their rights in
the current difficult economic environment.</P>
      <P>In a statement released Wednesday, the CLA indicated that its current policy on
foreign worker recruitment is based on the nation's unemployment rate, the labor
shortage rate and the demands of domestic industrial development as a whole.</P>
      <P>The CLA said that with the unemployment rate continuing to climb, it is closely
observing the national employment situation and will give priority to Taiwanese
workers' right to employment and good labor conditions, according to the
statement.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, the CLA said, it will review in the short term the number of
foreign workers recruited to Taiwan and their qualifications, enhance monitoring
of the proportion of national to foreign workers in enterprises, and control
massive job cuts, in the hope of stabilizing the employment market for national
workers.</P>
      <P>The CLA reiterated that the current policy of admitting foreign workers must not
impact negatively on labor conditions and job opportunities for Taiwan
nationals.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level agency also stated that it will look at the current procedures
for the recruitment and management of foreign workers, promote employment
services and provide vocational training for Taiwanese  workers in order to help
nationals  tide over the unemployment crisis.</P>
      <P>According to the CLA, there were 365,000 foreign workers in Taiwan as of the end
of March this year, representing 3.5 percent of Taiwan's working population.
Among these foreign workers, 198,000 were industrial workers and the rest were
caregivers.</P>
      <P>Most of Taiwan's foreign workers come from Southeast Asian countries, such as
Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam, to undertake so-called "3D"
jobs -- dangerous, dirty and difficult.</P>

Taiwan, joint development of new herbal drugs, and mutual cooperation in tapping
the world herbal medicine market.</P>
      <P>Yiin said the government in Taipei will continue to "build more bridges" and

      <P>Despite the economic slowdown, tourists, mainly Taiwanese travelers, had made
over 21 million visits to Tainan County as of the end of October, an increase of
nearly 30 percent from the year-earlier level, tourism officials of the southern
Taiwan county reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>County tourism officials attributed the noticeable growth in the number of
visitors from across the country to a more convenient transportation network,
including the high speed rail system, which began operations last year.</P>
      <P>Although most city and county governments in Taiwan are keen to lure more
Chinese tourists, particularly after direct charter flight services opened
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in July this year, the officials
admitted that the number of Chinese visitors to Tainan County remains low.</P>
      <P>Most of the Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan would simply skip Tainan County or
stay only for a few hours, they said.</P>
      <P>"So far, Chinese tourist arrivals have not created brisk business in the
southern county," the officials noted.</P>
      <P>In 2007, local and foreign tourists made some 16.59 million visits to Tainan
County, an increase of 6.1 percent compared to the 2006 figure of 15.63 million,
county statistics showed.</P>
      <P>Apart from touring Tainan's historical sites, visitors can enjoy the county's
hot springs and pursue ecological activities, such as bird watching, the
officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan remains free of H5N1; suspected H5N2 case still being checked</HEADLINE>

      <P>There have been no infections of the virulent H5N1 avian flu virus in Taiwan to
date, a senior official with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the
Cabinet-level Department of Health said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>There  are also  no confirmed  cases  of an outbreak  of low-pathogenic H5N2
avian flu virus among poultry in Taiwan, CDC Deputy Director Lin Ting said,
adding that there is no evidence that the H5N2 can jump species to infect
humans.</P>
      <P>As of Tuesday, the CDC had received reports of eight suspected cases of H5N1
infections in humans, among which two people had visited China, one had visited
Vietnam and five had been in close contact with poultry, Lin said.</P>
      <P>"Examination  results showed that five cases were seasonal influenza virus
infections and the remaining three tested negative for any flu viruses, " Lin
said, adding that none of suspected cases were H5N1 infections.</P>
      <P>Quoting data released by the World Health Organization (WHO), Lin said more than
60 percent of confirmed human H5N1 cases have had close contact with poultry.</P>
      <P>He advised local people to avoid contact with wild birds or chickens when they
travel to countries or areas where H5N1 outbreaks among humans or animals have
been reported, particularly Hong Kong, China's Jiangsu province, Indonesia,
Egypt and Cambodia.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin said an outbreak of low-pathogenic H5N2 avian flu is not uncommon
among poultry but that the infection usually does not have a grave impact on
animals. Even if the virus mutates to a high-pathogenic strain, it would only
affect poultry, he said.</P>
      <P>To date, Lin said, only a few Japanese officials working in animal quarantine
jobs have tested positive for weak H5N2 antibodies after slaughtering chickens
infected with the virus. "None of the workers have developed the disease, which
indicates that H5N2 is unlikely to infect humans," he added.</P>

      <P>The air carrier that is scheduled to transport a gift of two giant pandas from
China to Taiwan abandoned a plan Wednesday to invite passengers to travel aboard
the same flight with the animals.</P>
      <P>Eva Airways, which will fly to Chengdu, Sichuan province, Dec. 22 and bring them
back to Taiwan the next day, announced Tuesday that it was making seats
available for 100 people on the flight to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, the airline abruptly withdrew the offer Wednesday after it drew flak
from animal conservationists.</P>
      <P>The conservationists argued that pandas are shy animals and that they should be
disturbed as little as possible during the transportation process. In response,
EVA Air said it "decided to accept the suggestion of the experts."</P>
      <P>Eva officials said those travel agents that have accepted reservations will

      <P>China first offered the pandas as a gift in 2005, but the offer was rejected by

      <P>Dismissing local newspaper reports about an attempt to cover up a possible
outbreak of bird flu in southern Taiwan, a government official said Wednesday
that there is no H5N2 avian flu outbreak in Taiwan and that the government is
still tracking the cause of the deaths among chickens at a local poultry farm.</P>
      <P>"There have been no concrete signs of bird flu in Taiwan, except for an incident
in late October at a poultry farm in Luchu township in Kaohsiung County, " said
Huang Kuo-ching, deputy director of the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health
Inspection and Quarantine under the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA),
during an animal disease prevention meeting in Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, COA officials are still double checking agents obtained from
the poultry farm in order to determine the cause of the deaths among the
chickens in Luchu and will publish the findings upon completion of the
examinations.</P>
      <P>The area adjacent to the poultry farm has also been closely monitored, and
nothing unusual has been detected, he noted.</P>
      <P>Close to 400 chickens were found dead at the Luchu poultry farm in late October,
giving rise to speculations that the deaths may have been caused by an outbreak
of avian flu.</P>
      <P>COA officials initiated an investigation into the cause of the chicken deaths
and the preliminary findings showed that the birds had been infected with low-
pathogenic H5N2 bird flu virus -- a species that is not known to jump to infect
humans, Huang said.</P>
      <P>As the fatality rate among chickens at the poultry farm was below 3 percent,
which is far lower than the average mortality rate in cases of the low-
pathogenic H5N2 virus, the COA is hesitant to categorize it as an epidemic,
Huang explained, adding that the council had never tried to cover up any bird
flu outbreak.</P>
      <P>All the remaining 18,000 chickens at the farm were culled in an effort to keep
the situation under control, he added.</P>
      <P>Later Wednesday, Japan announced that it will immediately halt poultry meat
imports from Taiwan on a temporary basis.</P>
      <P>Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced on its

      <P>The Taiwan High Court ordered the Taipei District Court Wednesday to reconsider
its earlier decision to release former President Chen Shui-bian without bail
pending trial on corruption and money laundering charges.</P>
      <P>The high court gave the order after the Supreme Prosecutors Office's Special
Investigation Division (SID) filed an appeal Tuesday against Chen's release
early last Saturday.</P>
      <P>In the appeal presented to the Taiwan High Court, the prosecutors said they will
soon begin to investigate several other corruption cases allegedly involving
Chen and his wife, and that if he is allowed to remain free, some of the
witnesses, including three of his former close aides, might not dare to tell the
truth.</P>
      <P>High court spokesman Wen Yao-yuan echoed the SID prosecutors' concerns,  saying
that the possibility of Chen colluding with witnesses and co-defendants in the
cases to tamper with or destroy evidence before the trial cannot be excluded.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Wen said, the district court should reconsider the case
and return a new ruling.</P>
      <P>In response, Taipei District Court spokesman Huang Chun-ming said that as the
SID prosecutors stated in their appeal that they hoped the high court itself
would return a new ruling, the district court had sent all relevant files and
documents to the high court.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, we have to wait until all those documents are sent back to the
district court to hand down a new ruling," Huang said.</P>
      <P>If all goes well, he added, the district court will open a hearing on the appeal
Thursday afternoon at the earliest.</P>
      <P>Chen was released Dec.13 upon his own recognizance, despite a request by
prosecutors to keep him in custody, after he had been detained for 32 days as
prosecutors prepared four cases against him. After four months of
investigations, he and 13 other people were indicted Dec. 12 on charges of
embezzlement, bribe-taking and money laundering.</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife were indicted for embezzling NT$104 million (US$3.12 million)
from a special Presidential Office discretionary fund during his presidency from
2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>They were also charged with accepting bribes worth NT$100 million and NT$200
million in connection with a land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million
in kickbacks to help a contractor win the tender for a government construction
project, according to the indictment.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors recommended that the former president be given the harshest
possible sentence for his alleged crimes involving nearly half a billion new
Taiwan dollars.</P>
      <P>They also demanded severe penalties for his wife, son and daughter-in-law for
their "unrepentant attitude" in the course of the investigations, and
recommended commuted sentences for 10 other defendants whom prosecutors said had
been cooperative and helpful in the process of the investigations.</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) expects indicted former
President Chen Shui-bian to reflect on the morality issues pertaining to himself
and his family, DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with reporters following a meeting of the DPP's Central Standing
Committee, Cheng said that DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen had made the appeal to
the former president in a letter to the editor of a local newspaper.</P>
      <P>In the letter published in the Chinese-language China Times Wednesday, Tsai
said, "We expect him to set an example for the society. He must reflect upon the
morality issues pertaining to himself and his family, and face the law bravely."</P>
      <P>Cheng noted that the DPP chairwoman had already apologized to the Taiwan people
on behalf of the DPP over the corruption and money laundering scandals
implicating the former president and his family.</P>
      <P>Cheng  said Tsai's  apology  represented  the party's  own introspection, as the
former president was a part of the DPP although he and his wife withdrew from
the party in August after admitting that they had wired large sums of money
abroad.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the former president also needs to engage in introspection, Cheng
said, "We do have expectations."</P>
      <P>The DPP's call on Chen and his family to face the law came a day after DPP
Legislator Chiu Yi-ying, a former staunch supporter of the ex-president, urged
the four indicted members of the former first family, especially former first
lady Wu Shu-jen, to "face the law, instead of telling more lies and fooling
around with the feelings of the DPP members."</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife were indicted last week on charges of embezzlement, bribe-
taking, money laundering and forgery in four cases.</P>
      <P>According to the Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutor's
Office, Chen and his wife embezzled NT$104 million (US$3.12 million) from a
special Presidential Office discretionary fund during his presidency from 2000
to 2008.</P>
      <P>They also took bribes worth NT$100 million and NT$200 million in connection with
a land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million in kickbacks to help a
contractor win the tender for a government construction project, according to
the indictment.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors recommended that the former president be given the harshest
possible sentence for his alleged crimes involving nearly half a billion new
Taiwan dollars.</P>
      <P>They also demanded severe penalties for his wife, son and daughter-in-law for
their "unrepentant attitude" in the course of investigations, and recommending
commuted sentences for 10 other defendants whom prosecutors said had been

      <P>Chen was released Dec. 13 upon his own recognizance shortly after the
indictment, despite a request by prosecutors to keep him in custody, after he
had been detained for 32 days as prosecutors prepared their cases against him.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors have filed an appeal with the Taiwan High Court against Chen's
release, contending that, as they still need to investigate several other
corruption cases involving Chen and his wife, some of the witnesses might not
dare to tell the truth if he is allowed to remain free.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors also said they still need to trace NT$570 million (US$17.29
million) in bribe money, and that if Chen is not in custody, he could erase the
evidence, as he tried to do before he was detained.</P>

nearly 30 percent from the year-earlier level, tourism officials of the southern
Taiwan county reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>County tourism officials attributed the noticeable growth in the number of
visitors from across the country to a more convenient transportation network,
including the high speed rail system, which began operations last year.</P>
      <P>Although most city and county governments in Taiwan are keen to lure more
Chinese tourists, particularly after direct charter flight services opened
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in July this year, the officials
admitted that the number of Chinese visitors to Tainan County remains low.</P>
      <P>Most of the Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan would simply skip Tainan County or
stay only for a few hours, they said.</P>
      <P>"So far, Chinese tourist arrivals have not created brisk business in the
southern county," the officials noted.</P>
      <P>In 2007, local and foreign tourists made some 16.59 million visits to Tainan
County, an increase of 6.1 percent compared to the 2006 figure of 15.63 million,
county statistics showed.</P>
      <P>Apart from touring Tainan's historical sites, visitors can enjoy the county's
hot springs and pursue ecological activities, such as bird watching, the
officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan remains free of H5N1; suspected H5N2 case still being checked</HEADLINE>

      <P>There have been no infections of the virulent H5N1 avian flu virus in Taiwan to
date, a senior official with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the
Cabinet-level Department of Health said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>There  are also  no confirmed  cases  of an outbreak  of low-pathogenic H5N2
avian flu virus among poultry in Taiwan, CDC Deputy Director Lin Ting said,
adding that there is no evidence that the H5N2 can jump species to infect
humans.</P>
      <P>As of Tuesday, the CDC had received reports of eight suspected cases of H5N1
infections in humans, among which two people had visited China, one had visited
Vietnam and five had been in close contact with poultry, Lin said.</P>
      <P>"Examination  results showed that five cases were seasonal influenza virus
infections and the remaining three tested negative for any flu viruses, " Lin
said, adding that none of suspected cases were H5N1 infections.</P>
      <P>Quoting data released by the World Health Organization (WHO), Lin said more than
60 percent of confirmed human H5N1 cases have had close contact with poultry.</P>
      <P>He advised local people to avoid contact with wild birds or chickens when they
travel to countries or areas where H5N1 outbreaks among humans or animals have
been reported, particularly Hong Kong, China's Jiangsu province, Indonesia,
Egypt and Cambodia.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin said an outbreak of low-pathogenic H5N2 avian flu is not uncommon
among poultry but that the infection usually does not have a grave impact on
animals. Even if the virus mutates to a high-pathogenic strain, it would only
affect poultry, he said.</P>
      <P>To date, Lin said, only a few Japanese officials working in animal quarantine
jobs have tested positive for weak H5N2 antibodies after slaughtering chickens
infected with the virus. "None of the workers have developed the disease, which
indicates that H5N2 is unlikely to infect humans," he added.</P>

      <P>The air carrier that is scheduled to transport a gift of two giant pandas from
China to Taiwan abandoned a plan Wednesday to invite passengers to travel aboard
the same flight with the animals.</P>
      <P>Eva Airways, which will fly to Chengdu, Sichuan province, Dec. 22 and bring them

available for 100 people on the flight to Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The conservationists argued that pandas are shy animals and that they should be

      <P>Dismissing local newspaper reports about an attempt to cover up a possible
outbreak of bird flu in southern Taiwan, a government official said Wednesday
that there is no H5N2 avian flu outbreak in Taiwan and that the government is
still tracking the cause of the deaths among chickens at a local poultry farm.</P>
      <P>"There have been no concrete signs of bird flu in Taiwan, except for an incident
in late October at a poultry farm in Luchu township in Kaohsiung County, " said
Huang Kuo-ching, deputy director of the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health
Inspection and Quarantine under the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA),
during an animal disease prevention meeting in Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, COA officials are still double checking agents obtained from
the poultry farm in order to determine the cause of the deaths among the
chickens in Luchu and will publish the findings upon completion of the
examinations.</P>
      <P>The area adjacent to the poultry farm has also been closely monitored, and
nothing unusual has been detected, he noted.</P>
      <P>Close to 400 chickens were found dead at the Luchu poultry farm in late October,
giving rise to speculations that the deaths may have been caused by an outbreak
of avian flu.</P>
      <P>COA officials initiated an investigation into the cause of the chicken deaths
and the preliminary findings showed that the birds had been infected with low-
pathogenic H5N2 bird flu virus -- a species that is not known to jump to infect
humans, Huang said.</P>
      <P>As the fatality rate among chickens at the poultry farm was below 3 percent,
which is far lower than the average mortality rate in cases of the low-
pathogenic H5N2 virus, the COA is hesitant to categorize it as an epidemic,
Huang explained, adding that the council had never tried to cover up any bird
flu outbreak.</P>
      <P>All the remaining 18,000 chickens at the farm were culled in an effort to keep
the situation under control, he added.</P>
      <P>Later Wednesday, Japan announced that it will immediately halt poultry meat
imports from Taiwan on a temporary basis.</P>
      <P>Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced on its

      <P>The Taiwan High Court ordered the Taipei District Court Wednesday to reconsider
its earlier decision to release former President Chen Shui-bian without bail
pending trial on corruption and money laundering charges.</P>
      <P>The high court gave the order after the Supreme Prosecutors Office's Special
Investigation Division (SID) filed an appeal Tuesday against Chen's release
early last Saturday.</P>
      <P>In the appeal presented to the Taiwan High Court, the prosecutors said they will
soon begin to investigate several other corruption cases allegedly involving
Chen and his wife, and that if he is allowed to remain free, some of the
witnesses, including three of his former close aides, might not dare to tell the
truth.</P>
      <P>High court spokesman Wen Yao-yuan echoed the SID prosecutors' concerns,  saying
that the possibility of Chen colluding with witnesses and co-defendants in the
cases to tamper with or destroy evidence before the trial cannot be excluded.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Wen said, the district court should reconsider the case
and return a new ruling.</P>
      <P>In response, Taipei District Court spokesman Huang Chun-ming said that as the
SID prosecutors stated in their appeal that they hoped the high court itself
would return a new ruling, the district court had sent all relevant files and
documents to the high court.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, we have to wait until all those documents are sent back to the
district court to hand down a new ruling," Huang said.</P>
      <P>If all goes well, he added, the district court will open a hearing on the appeal
Thursday afternoon at the earliest.</P>
      <P>Chen was released Dec.13 upon his own recognizance, despite a request by
prosecutors to keep him in custody, after he had been detained for 32 days as
prosecutors prepared four cases against him. After four months of
investigations, he and 13 other people were indicted Dec. 12 on charges of
embezzlement, bribe-taking and money laundering.</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife were indicted for embezzling NT$104 million (US$3.12 million)
from a special Presidential Office discretionary fund during his presidency from
2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>They were also charged with accepting bribes worth NT$100 million and NT$200
million in connection with a land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million
in kickbacks to help a contractor win the tender for a government construction
project, according to the indictment.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors recommended that the former president be given the harshest
possible sentence for his alleged crimes involving nearly half a billion new
Taiwan dollars.</P>
      <P>They also demanded severe penalties for his wife, son and daughter-in-law for
their "unrepentant attitude" in the course of the investigations, and
recommended commuted sentences for 10 other defendants whom prosecutors said had
been cooperative and helpful in the process of the investigations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) expects indicted former
President Chen Shui-bian to reflect on the morality issues pertaining to himself
and his family, DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with reporters following a meeting of the DPP's Central Standing
Committee, Cheng said that DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen had made the appeal to
the former president in a letter to the editor of a local newspaper.</P>
      <P>In the letter published in the Chinese-language China Times Wednesday, Tsai
said, "We expect him to set an example for the society. He must reflect upon the
morality issues pertaining to himself and his family, and face the law bravely."</P>
      <P>Cheng noted that the DPP chairwoman had already apologized to the Taiwan people
on behalf of the DPP over the corruption and money laundering scandals
implicating the former president and his family.</P>
      <P>Cheng  said Tsai's  apology  represented  the party's  own introspection, as the
former president was a part of the DPP although he and his wife withdrew from
the party in August after admitting that they had wired large sums of money
abroad.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the former president also needs to engage in introspection, Cheng
said, "We do have expectations."</P>
      <P>The DPP's call on Chen and his family to face the law came a day after DPP
Legislator Chiu Yi-ying, a former staunch supporter of the ex-president, urged
the four indicted members of the former first family, especially former first
lady Wu Shu-jen, to "face the law, instead of telling more lies and fooling
around with the feelings of the DPP members."</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife were indicted last week on charges of embezzlement, bribe-
taking, money laundering and forgery in four cases.</P>
      <P>According to the Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutor's
Office, Chen and his wife embezzled NT$104 million (US$3.12 million) from a
special Presidential Office discretionary fund during his presidency from 2000
to 2008.</P>
      <P>They also took bribes worth NT$100 million and NT$200 million in connection with
a land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million in kickbacks to help a
contractor win the tender for a government construction project, according to
the indictment.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors recommended that the former president be given the harshest
possible sentence for his alleged crimes involving nearly half a billion new
Taiwan dollars.</P>
      <P>They also demanded severe penalties for his wife, son and daughter-in-law for
their "unrepentant attitude" in the course of investigations, and recommending
commuted sentences for 10 other defendants whom prosecutors said had been

      <P>Chen was released Dec. 13 upon his own recognizance shortly after the
indictment, despite a request by prosecutors to keep him in custody, after he
had been detained for 32 days as prosecutors prepared their cases against him.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors have filed an appeal with the Taiwan High Court against Chen's
release, contending that, as they still need to investigate several other
corruption cases involving Chen and his wife, some of the witnesses might not
dare to tell the truth if he is allowed to remain free.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors also said they still need to trace NT$570 million (US$17.29
million) in bribe money, and that if Chen is not in custody, he could erase the
evidence, as he tried to do before he was detained.</P>

prosecutors to keep him in custody, after he had been detained for 32 days as

investigations, he and 13 other people were indicted Dec. 12 on charges of
embezzlement, bribe-taking and money laundering.</P>

      <P>They were also charged with accepting bribes worth NT$100 million and NT$200
million in connection with a land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million
in kickbacks to help a contractor win the tender for a government construction
project, according to the indictment.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors recommended that the former president be given the harshest
possible sentence for his alleged crimes involving nearly half a billion new
Taiwan dollars.</P>
      <P>They also demanded severe penalties for his wife, son and daughter-in-law for

    <HEADLINE>DPP urges former president to reflect on his morality issues</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 17 (CNA)
12/18/08  10:51:34

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) expects indicted former
President Chen Shui-bian to reflect on the morality issues pertaining to himself
and his family, DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with reporters following a meeting of the DPP's Central Standing
Committee, Cheng said that DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen had made the appeal to
the former president in a letter to the editor of a local newspaper.</P>
      <P>In the letter published in the Chinese-language China Times Wednesday, Tsai
said, "We expect him to set an example for the society. He must reflect upon the
morality issues pertaining to himself and his family, and face the law bravely."</P>
      <P>Cheng noted that the DPP chairwoman had already apologized to the Taiwan people
on behalf of the DPP over the corruption and money laundering scandals
implicating the former president and his family.</P>
      <P>Cheng  said Tsai's  apology  represented  the party's  own introspection, as the
former president was a part of the DPP although he and his wife withdrew from
the party in August after admitting that they had wired large sums of money
abroad.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the former president also needs to engage in introspection, Cheng
said, "We do have expectations."</P>
      <P>The DPP's call on Chen and his family to face the law came a day after DPP
Legislator Chiu Yi-ying, a former staunch supporter of the ex-president, urged
the four indicted members of the former first family, especially former first
lady Wu Shu-jen, to "face the law, instead of telling more lies and fooling
around with the feelings of the DPP members."</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife were indicted last week on charges of embezzlement, bribe-
taking, money laundering and forgery in four cases.</P>
      <P>According to the Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutor's
Office, Chen and his wife embezzled NT$104 million (US$3.12 million) from a
special Presidential Office discretionary fund during his presidency from 2000
to 2008.</P>
      <P>They also took bribes worth NT$100 million and NT$200 million in connection with
a land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million in kickbacks to help a
contractor win the tender for a government construction project, according to
the indictment.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors recommended that the former president be given the harshest
possible sentence for his alleged crimes involving nearly half a billion new
Taiwan dollars.</P>
      <P>They also demanded severe penalties for his wife, son and daughter-in-law for
their "unrepentant attitude" in the course of investigations, and recommending
commuted sentences for 10 other defendants whom prosecutors said had been
cooperative and helpful in the process of the investigations.</P>
      <P>Chen was released Dec. 13 upon his own recognizance shortly after the
indictment, despite a request by prosecutors to keep him in custody, after he
had been detained for 32 days as prosecutors prepared their cases against him.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors have filed an appeal with the Taiwan High Court against Chen's
release, contending that, as they still need to investigate several other
corruption cases involving Chen and his wife, some of the witnesses might not
dare to tell the truth if he is allowed to remain free.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors also said they still need to trace NT$570 million (US$17.29
million) in bribe money, and that if Chen is not in custody, he could erase the
evidence, as he tried to do before he was detained.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A suspected outbreak of bird flu reported recently in southern Taiwan has caused
the local poultry industry tens of million of New Taiwan dollars in losses, the
Council of Agriculture (COA) estimated Thursday.</P>
      <P>COA Minister Chen Wu-hsiung reiterated that Taiwan should be considered free of
bird flu unless a second test of the suspected case turns up positive.</P>
      <P>The council has asked Taiwan's representative office in Japan help communicate
with Japanese authorities following their decision to suspend poultry meat
imports from Taiwan over the incident, Chen said.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, the COA reported that approximately 400 chickens were found dead
at a poultry farm in Luchu township, Kaohsiung County in late October and that
preliminary findings showed the birds had been infected with low-pathogenic H5N2
bird flu virus -- a strain that is not known to jump to humans.</P>
      <P>A reexamination is still under way to determine the cause of the deaths. All the
remaining 18,000 chickens at the farm were culled as a precautionary measure,
according to the COA.</P>
      <P>The COA disclosed the information in an attempt to clarify a media report that
accused the COA of trying to cover up a bird flu outbreak.</P>
      <P>Japan announced later that day that it will halt poultry meat imports from
Taiwan on a temporary basis to prevent the H5N2 bird flu virus from entering the
country.</P>
      <P>Hsu Tien-lai, head of the COA's Animal Husbandry Department, said Thursday that
even if the second test ruled out a bird flu infection, Japanese authorities
will not resume the imports immediately but will first conduct an evaluation,
which can take several months.</P>
      <P>COA statistics show that the poultry meat and egg exports from Taiwan to Japan
are valued at around US$28 million per year.</P>
      <P>In the first 11 months of this year, Taiwan exported to Japan 4,733 tons of duck
meat worth US$22.86 million, 1,758 tons of chicken meat worth US$2.19 million,
and 639 tons of eggs worth US$2.48 million, according to the COA.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei Zoo simulates opening of panda house</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei Zoo conducted a simulation exercise Thursday morning to see whether
its panda house could accommodate the expected influx of visitors after two
giant pandas from China are delivered to Taiwan on Dec. 23.</P>
      <P>According to zoo authorities, the panda house was opened for an hour Thursday
morning for the simulation activity.</P>
      <P>Taipei City government spokesperson  and the Department of Information and
Tourism Commissioner Yang Hsiao-tung, who joined the activity, said the gift of
the two pandas from China will take just under three hours to be delivered to
the Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The animals, named Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan, will be taken from</P>
      <P>their home at the China Panda-protection Research Center in</P>
      <P>Ya'an to the international airport in Chengdu where they will be</P>
      <P>put on board an EVA Air flight at around 2 p.m., Dec. 23,</P>
      <P>according to Yang.</P>
      <P>Immediately after their arrival at Taiwan's Taoyuan International airport, the
two pandas will be taken directly to their new home at the Taipei Zoo under
police escort, he added.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese authorities are scheduled to hold a farewell ceremony for the
pandas before they leave China, he said.</P>
      <P>Eva Air had originally offered 100 seats to passengers on the flight to Taiwan
carrying the pandas, but it aborted the plan on Wednesday on animal rights
concerns.</P>
      <P>After discussions with animal protection experts from mainland China, EVA Air
called off the plan to have 100 tourists travel on the same flight with the
animals, Yang said, stressing that "this was not a Taipei City government
decision."</P>
      <P>The animal protection experts contended that as pandas are very shy animals they
should endure as little disturbance as possible on the flight from China to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether the panda house would be open to the public during
the Lunar New Year holidays, Yang said this would depend on the health of the
two animals.</P>
      <P>However, he added, the fact that the Taipei Zoo has been able to secure the
right to house the rare pandas is a reflection of the recognition it has gained
for its animal protection and environmental conservation efforts.</P>
      <P>"I am very confident that these two pandas will receive the best possible care
at the zoo," said Yang.</P>
      <P>While the pandas will be housed at the zoo immediately after they are delivered
to Taiwan, they will remain in quarantine for at least a month before public
viewing will be allowed. Zoo officials hope the pandas can make their public
debut in Taiwan around the Lunar New Year, which falls on Jan. 26.</P>
      <P>China offered the two pandas as gift to Taiwan in 2005 during an ice-breaking
visit to Beijing by then opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>The names Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan, which together mean "reunion" or
"unification" in Chinese, were selected by the Chinese authorities by means of
an online poll.</P>

      <P>A cancer patient died after a fire broke out at the National Taiwan University
Hospital while he was undergoing surgery, the hospital said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The patient, a man suffering from esophageal cancer, was one of two patients
being operated on when a fire broke out around 7:22 p.m. Wednesday in the
operating room on the 4th floor of the hospital's new building, according to the
hospital.</P>
      <P>The automatic sprinkler system was activated after the fire started, but smoke
continued to belch out in the surgical rooms where 11 surgeons and nurses were
performing surgeries on the patient and another patient suffering from heart
disease.</P>
      <P>Both patients were under general anaesthesia.</P>
      <P>The cancer patient was rushed to the intensive care ward of the hospital and
urgently fitted with an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) device, which
is similiar to a heart-lung machine, but he died at 0:05 a.m. Thursday, the
hospital said.</P>
      <P>The 11 medical professionals as well as the other patient suffered various
degrees of smoke inhalation. The medical staff as well as the heart patient were
in stable situation after receiving treatment, the hospital said.</P>
      <P>The hospital evacuated 800 patients and urgently arranged 23 patients who had to
rely on respirators to be transferred to other hospitals.</P>
      <P>The fire was put out at 9:10 p.m.</P>
      <P>It was the first serious fire that occurred at the hospital's new building since
it was inaugurated in September 1991.</P>
      <P>Police are investigating the cause of the blaze.</P>
      <P>The hospital resumed between 60 percent to 70 percent of its scheduled surgeries
Thursday. A health examination service which was suspended Thursday will also be
resumed Friday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Direct cross-strait links aimed at boosting private sector: premier</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's policy of establishing direct air, shipping and postal links
between Taiwan and China is aimed at benefiting the local private sector,
Premier Liu Chao-shuan said during an Executive Yuan meeting Thursday.</P>
      <P>I hope that all businesses in the private sector will reap the advantages and
benefits of the direct links between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, " said
Liu. "I also hope that all government agencies will be able to meet the needs of
the people and answer their questions on this issue."</P>
      <P>Noting that the establishment of direct air transportation, shipping links and
postal exchanges between Taiwan and China was implemented on Dec. 15, Liu said
this was achieved by the current administration under the principle of doing
what is best for the people.</P>
      <P>"In the past, direct links were discussed but were not realized," said Liu,
adding that President Ma Ying-jeou has fulfilled his election promise on this
issue.</P>
      <P>Given the significantly lower costs and shorter time to transport cargo and
passengers now between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan's economy is
expected to get a shot in the arm from the new links, the premier said.</P>
      <P>"The government should grasp this opportunity to do what is best for the private
sector so that businessmen and ordinary citizens would be able to take advantage
of the new openings," he suggested.</P>
      <P>The private sector estimates that the establishment of two-way direct cross-
strait transport links would save Taiwan up to US$90 million per year in travel
and shipping costs.</P>
      <P>Because the investment  environment  in mainland China has undergone drastic
changes in recent years, particularly in the areas of environmental protection
and labor and tax laws, operation costs for Taiwan businessmen in China have
increased, according to Liu.</P>
      <P>Therefore, we would also like to use the direct cross-strait transportation and
shipping links to lure Taiwan businessmen in the China to invest at home," he
said.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, the premier said, he has directed all government agencies to
evaluate the current situation and propose new plans to enhance Taiwan's
competitiveness so as to maximize the benefits of the direct cross-strait links.</P>
      <P>Liu said while the benefits of the exchanges between the two sides will increase
exponentially, it can also be expected that some problems will emerge.</P>
      <P>"I am asking the Mainland Affairs Council to look at the possible issues that
could arise," he said.</P>
      <P>Liu said that he hopes that the establishment of regular dialogue between the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and its mainland counterpart, the Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), will lead to the peaceful and
fruitful development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>The launch of direct cross-strait shipping links is one of four agreements
sealed by the two sides Nov. 4 to expand transport exchanges, postal services
and establish a food safety mechanism.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has won six gold medals in an international high school student science
competition in South Korea, with each of its six participants bringing home
gold, an official of the Ministry of Education said late Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The six award-winning students are Tung Yu-hung, Chao Ling-ya, and Huang Po-wei
from northern Taiwan, Chen Yu-hsiang and Hsu Tzu-min from central Taiwan, and Wu
Kuan-jung from southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The students were selected this summer and received coaching at National  Taiwan
Normal University  (NTNU)  in Taipei City in preparation for the competition.</P>
      <P>The 2008 International Junior Science Olympiad, held from Dec. 6-15, drew 253
students from 43 countries.</P>
      <P>The competition is held annually for students under the age of 16 to test their
knowledge in physics, chemistry, and biology.</P>
      <P>The competition is held in three areas -- an examination in pure physics,
chemistry and biology; a theoretical segment; and a practical segment that
combines the three subjects.</P>
      <P>Lo Pei-hua, a science coach and an associate researcher at NTNU's Science
Education Center, said in Taipei that Tung, a junior high school student from
Taipei Fuhsing Private School, had the top score in the theoretical tests, which
won him the Best Theory prize.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan and South Korea teams were the only two that had the distinction of
all their members winning gold, although overall South Korea's scores were
slightly higher than Taiwan's, Lo said.</P>
      <P>While the Taiwan students were coached to ensure that they all attained the
required level of proficiency in science, they had to rely on their own ability
to achieve success in the competition, and they sacrificed many of their other
interests to do so, Lo said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan won five golds and one silver in each of the first three years of the
contest, and took six golds in last year's competition, which it hosted, the
education official added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Scholar urges government to prepare Taiwan for immigrant issues</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  18 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>In a conference held Thursday to mark International Migrants day, a scholar
warned that the government should consider and better prepare the country for
issues regarding to immigrants, especially a second wave of immigrants - their
dependents, including elderly parents and children.</P>
      <P>Dependent migrants will become the biggest challenge on the migrant population
issue in the future, Ko Chyong-fang, researcher of the Institute of European and
American Studies at the Academia Sinica, told a conference.</P>
      <P>The conference, which focused on immigration trends worldwide, was organized by
the National Immigration Agency (NIA) under the Ministry of the Interior to mark
International Migrants Day, which falls on Dec. 18 each year.</P>
      <P>Ko said foreign spouses married to Taiwanese residents here will eventually
bring to Taiwan his or her family members from their original countries.</P>
      <P>Up to now, Taiwan's laws have made it difficult for the island's largest group
of immigrants - those from mainland China - to sponsor their family members from
China here, but the government recently announced it plans to lift restrictions
to make Taiwan's immigration rules on par with developed countries, such as the
United States, where family unification is considered an immigration priority.</P>
      <P>If an amendment to the law is passed by Taiwan's legislature, mainland spouses
will be able to sponsor children under 12 from a previous marriage to come to
Taiwan, without having to waiting the prohibitive 13 years as they do now.</P>
      <P>Ko said that receiving immigrants who hold dependent visas is becoming a global
trend of human rights, urging the government to look into the issue.</P>
      <P>To reduce social problems due to inter-cultural or inter-racial marriages, Ko
suggested that the government also enhance gender rights education and improve
the mechanism of interviewing foreign spouses.  Other than mainland women,
Southeast Asian women from Vietnam and other countries, are also marrying
Taiwanese men in large numbers. Many of them arrive without an understanding of
the local language or culture.</P>
      <P>Ko stressed that Taiwanese residents should fully understand the new
immigrantsoriginal cultures and histories, in order to avoid conflicts.</P>
      <P>Difference (between us and new immigrants) is not a problem of right and wrong
or superior and inferior,Ko said. The divorce rate in marriages involving
Taiwanese and foreign spouses is considered by some government officials and
scholars to be high, although the divorce rate in marriages between Taiwanese
people is also high.</P>
      <P>In terms of education and counselling for new immigrants, Ko said awell-
organized system of learning Mandarin should be established and that local
authorities need to set up cross-border marriage service centers.</P>
      <P>The United Nations designated the International Migrants Day in 2000 to raise
awareness of the world's 200 million migrants' contribution to social and
economic development.</P>
      <P>According to the NIA, the number of new immigrants in Taiwan has reached
410,000, including 270,000 from China and the rest coming mostly from Southeast
Asia.</P>
      <P>If foreign workers and other white-collar migrants are included, the number
would be more than 900,000. There are around 365,000 blue collar foreign
laborers in Taiwan, many of whom work in the manufacturing,  household
services,  caretaker and construction sectors. Some of them fall victim to high
fees charged by recruitment agencies and other abuses.</P>
      <P>Along with the conference, two exhibitions displaying immigrants' cultures, also
organized by the NIA, will be staged over the weekend at the Taichung train
station in central Taiwan's Taichung city and at the Central Park metro station
in the southern port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>In Taipei, a fair will be held at the Huashan Cultural and Creative Industry
Center Saturday, to allow people a chance to appreciate new immigrants' dances,
music and foods.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The live-fire Hankuang war games will now be held every two years instead of
annually, Defense Minister Chen Chao-min said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a meeting at the Legislative Yuan Foreign Affairs and National
Defense Committee, Chen said that the 25th Hankuang war games, which were
scheduled for 2009, will held in 2010 instead.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the annual schedule does not allow enough time to work out the
kinks in the computerized warfare simulation, live-fire military drills and
other demonstrations that are part of the Hankuang war games.</P>
      <P>"Since I assumed the post of defense minister in May, I've found that the
problems have been piling up without being effectively tackled," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He added that this prompted him to reschedule the frequency of the military
exercises, which are intended to solidify the military's joint warfare plan
among the branches of the armed forces and sharpen their defense and combat
readiness.</P>
      <P>When asked by ruling Kuomintang Legislator Lin Yu-fang whether the computer-
simulated war games, code-named "Yu Shan," will continue to be held annually  as
they were under the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party administration
from 2000-2008, Chen said that the National Security Council (NSC) was in charge
of the "Yu Shan" war games and it would be up to the NSC to determine whether or
not the exercises should continue annually.</P>
      <P>The "Yu Shan" simulation was aimed at countering a possible invasion by Chinese
armed forces.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, effective from 2009, the regular troop training cycle will be changed
from one year to 18 months, according to Chiu Kuo-cheng, deputy chief of General
Staff for Operations and Planning, Ministry of National Defense, who was also at
the interpellation session.</P>

      <P>The shopping vouchers that will be issued by the government to stimulate
consumption will be ready for distribution to the public Jan. 18, with more than
23.18 million people eligible to receive them, the Ministry of the Interior said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Under the program, all Taiwanese citizens -- with the exception of those living
abroad without  an identity  card,  household registration or residency rights
-- and their foreign spouses will be eligible to each receive NT$3,600 in
vouchers.</P>
      <P>The restriction, however, does not apply to diplomatic officials and their
dependents  whose household registrations  have been invalidated because they
have lived overseas for long periods of time.</P>
      <P>Children born by the end of March 2009 who are registered as citizens of the
Republic of China will also be eligible to receive the vouchers.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of the Interior Chien Tai-land told a news conference that the
vouchers can be picked up in person at designated distribution centers that will
operate from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Jan. 18, or a proxy can be assigned to collect
the vouchers on the behalf of the principal recipient.</P>
      <P>Those who are not able to turn up Jan 18. can pick up the vouchers at designated
stations between Feb. 7 and April 30, Chien said, adding that those who fail to
claim the vouchers by the deadline will automatically waive their right to
obtain them.</P>
      <P>In the event of the death of an eligible recipient before the vouchers are
obtained, his or her legal heirs can get the vouchers instead, Chien said.</P>
      <P>According to the government's plan, the deadline for exchanging the vouchers for
goods or services is Sept. 30, 2009.</P>
      <P>Each set will consist of six vouchers valued at NT$500, and three at NT$200.
Users will not be issued change from a purchase that is less than the face value
of the voucher used.</P>
      <P>Also on Thursday, the Government Information Office unveiled samples of the
vouchers, which have various security features to prevent counterfeit.</P>
      <P>For example,  the vouchers were printed using the gravure technology and a
color-shifting ink that changes from copper to green, said Chou Chung-hsing,
director of the Technical Research and Development Office at the Central
Engraving and Printing Plant.</P>
      <P>Other features include invisible characters, a watermark in the shape of a plum
blossom and invisible fluorescent fibers, Chou said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's southern city of Kaohsiung has launched a test run of two hybrid buses
that use both hydrogen and fuel, in an attempt to determine whether the hybrid
technology can help reduce fuel cost, city government officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>As the first city in Taiwan to test the hybrid bus, Wang Kwo- tsai -- director-
general of the city's transportation bureau -- noted that if the six-month test
run produces satisfactory results, all of the city's 440 public buses will use
the hybrid system.</P>
      <P>Wang said that after using the hybrid technology developed by a Taiwan-based
manufacturer, Epoch Energy Technology Corp., each bus will use much less fuel
and emit much less carbon dioxide.</P>
      <P>The technology uses a catalyst to break down water into hydrogen and oxide.
While the hydrogen is used to power the car, the oxide is used to amplify the
combustion effect, according to the Web site of the company which produced the
technology.</P>
      <P>For each bus, 2,500 liters of diesel fuel can be saved every year --
representing a NT$50,000 (US$1,540) reduction in annual fuel cost, while carbon
emissions will be 6.7 tons less per bus per year, according to the city
government.</P>
      <P>Switching all buses to hybrid fuel will help the city reduce its annual fuel
cost by NT$22 million and total carbon emissions by 2, 948 tons, according to
Wang.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Poultry farmers complain of impact of unconfirmed bird flu reports</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Japan's decision to halt poultry imports from Taiwan following a news report
about a suspected bird flu outbreak on the island has sparked widespread
discontent among Taiwan's poultry farmers, who demanded Thursday that the
government swiftly resolve the problem.</P>
      <P>Poultry  farmers,  particularly  those in southern  Taiwan, complained that
their livelihood will be impacted and lashed out at what they called
irresponsible media reports.</P>
      <P>The problem was sparked Wednesday when the Liberty Times reported that a large
number of chickens at a poultry farm in Tainan County were confirmed by a
government laboratory to have died from the H5N2 bird flu virus last month. The
report alleged that the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) sought to
cover up the matter so as not to mar the launch of direct air, shipping and
postal links between Taiwan and mainland China on Monday.</P>
      <P>The COA denied the report. Huang Kuo-ching, deputy director of the COA's Bureau
of Animal  and Plant Health Inspection  and Quarantine, said Wednesday that
there is no H5N2 avian flu outbreak in Taiwan, except for an incident in late
October at a poultry farm in Luchu township, Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>As the fatality rate among chickens at the farm was below 3 percent, which is
far lower than the average mortality rate in cases of the low-pathogenic H5N2
virus, the COA was hesitant to categorize it as an epidemic, Huang explained,
adding that the council did not try to cover up any bird flu outbreak.</P>
      <P>All the remaining 18,000 chickens at the farm were culled in an effort to
prevent a spread, Huang said, adding that the situation was under control and
that nothing unusual has been detected so far.</P>
      <P>Despite the COA's explanation, Japan announced later Wednesday that it was
immediately halting poultry meat imports from Taiwan on a temporary basis to
prevent the H5N2 bird flu virus from entering its territory.</P>
      <P>Tang Jung-sheng, chairman of the Kaohsiung County chicken-raising association,
said Thursday that such unconfirmed reports will hurt the domestic industry,
particularly at the current time of economic recession when consumers are paring
back spending and buying less chicken.</P>
      <P>Representatives of industry associations across the country will call a meeting
Thursday in central Taiwan's Changhua County to discuss countermeasures in the
face of the latest development, said Tang.</P>
      <P>An executive  at the Taiwan's largest frozen poultry meat exporting company said
the Liberty Times report has dealt a heavy blow to Taiwan's frozen duck meat
exports to Japan. One of his company's duck meat containers shipped to Japan has
been destroyed there, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's frozen chicken meat exports are uncompetitive in the international
market, but the company's duck meat exports are popular in Japan and are sold in
the quality-conscious Japanese market at a similar price level as U.S. beef, he
said.</P>
      <P>Duck farmers urged the COA to quickly provide a clear explanation to Japan to
help farmers reduce possible losses.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-chu, a duck raiser in Fongyuan township in Changhua County in central
Taiwan said he felt very distressed after learning of the news, since most of
his ducks are exported to Japan at a very stable price.</P>
      <P>"Poultry farmers suffer a lot of monetary losses every time there are such news
report," Chen complained.   "I lost some NT$2 million (U$60,000) in just one
month last time when there was a similar false report," he said.</P>
      <P>The value of Taiwan's poultry meat exports to Japan totals around US$23 million
per year, with frozen duck meat as the bulk.</P>
      <P>In 2007, Japan imported 5,128 tons of poultry meat and 148 tons of chicken eggs
from Taiwan, Japanese government statistics showed.</P>
      <P>The COA is still trying to track the cause of the deaths among the dead
chickens, and will publish the findings upon completion of tests, the COA's
Huang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the impact of the Japan's newest measure is relatively small in the
rest of the country where the poultry industry is not prominent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>First review of draft FDA act approved by legislative committees</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two legislative committees jointly approved a draft  law Thursday  to set up the
Taiwan  Food and Drug Administration (TFDA) , paving the way for its submission
to the Legislative Yuan for further discussion.</P>
      <P>At the meeting, which was attended by members of the Health, Environment and
Labor Committee and the Judiciary and Organic Laws and Statutes Committee, the
TFDA Organic Law was approved with several modifications, including a clause
added to set up a review committee to ensure the effectiveness and safety of
food and drug products.</P>
      <P>Under the organic law approved by the Cabinet in late November, four offices and
bureaus presently under the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) will be
integrated to form the TFDA, with a staff of 505 people.</P>
      <P>The four bureaus are the Bureau of Food Safety, the Bureau of Pharmaceutical
Affairs, the Bureau of Food and Drug Analysis and the National Bureau of
Controlled Drugs.</P>
      <P>DOH Minister Yeh Ching-chuan said the new institution will help strengthen
control at source, speed up procedures at customs and enhance consumer safety.</P>
      <P>He added that the DOH has been censured twice by the Control Yuan recently --
once because of its inept handling of the recent scandal of melamine-tainted
milk powder imported from China and again because of its handling of a case in
which dragon fruit imported from Vietnam was found to be contaminated by
pesticide residue -- an indication that improvements need to be made in border
controls.</P>
      <P>"Three management centers will be set up in northern, central and southern
Taiwan, respectively, in order to enhance border controls and testing at
seaports and airports," said Yeh.</P>
      <P>At present, border controls and testing is under the purview of the Bureau of
Standards, Metrology and Inspection under the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>In addition, food and drinks businesses will be included under the TFDA's
management, Yeh noted.</P>
      <P>The TFDA is also expected to be tasked with helping to develop Taiwan's bio-
medicine.</P>
      <P>Legislators at the meeting also suggested that the DOH should enforce more
controls on Chinese products, especially with the implementation of direct
flights and shipping links that began earlier in the week.</P>
      <P>Chang Hsien-yao,  a ruling Kuomintang  legislator who also presented his own
version of the draft law, proposed that in addition to border controls, the TFDA
should further undertake offshore controls on imported goods in regions deemed
to be high-risk.</P>
      <P>The process of the TFDA's establishment was expedited after the melamine scandal
of September in which milk powder, creamers and some other milk products
imported from China were found to contain melamine, a toxic industrial compound
that can cause kidney stones and in extreme cases, renal failure.</P>
      <P>The incident, which sparked panic among consumers, helped raise awareness among
the public and the government of the necessity of better food safety measures.</P>

      <P>School children in southern Taiwan's Yunlin County will be treated to orange
juice twice a week from Thursday as part of the county government's efforts to
promote the locally produced fruit amid a glut in supply.</P>
      <P>Yunlin County Magistrate Su Chih-fen led teachers and students of Nanyang
Elementary School to drink a cup of orange juice in the school's sports field,
in a gesture endorsing a campaign launched by the county government to encourage
the public to consume more home grown oranges.</P>
      <P>The agricultural-based Yunlin County in southwestern Taiwan is one of the
country's major orange production areas. It has been suffering from a severe
price drop in Taiwan's market due to excessive supply and insufficient demand.</P>
      <P>Starting Thursday, some 80,000 students at local primary and junior high schools
will be able to enjoy a cup of orange juice twice a week during lunch, after a
decision was made in a meeting between county officials and school principals
earlier this week.</P>
      <P>Su thanked the school authorities for agreeing to take part in the promotion
campaign and hailed it as a great help to farmers. As many as one ton of oranges
can be consumed during one lunch by students at the Nanyang and Beikang
elementary schools alone, Su noted.</P>
      <P>Some 3,500 hectares of farmland in Yunlin are reserved for cultivating oranges
-- and the land can yield more than 80,000 metric tons of the fruit this year.</P>
      <P>The amount of oranges produced is apparently more than the domestic market can
consume, as more growers have dedicated more land to cultivating the fruit in
recent years.</P>
      <P>Apart from elementary and middle schools, the Yunlin county government is also
cooperating with restaurantes and supermarkets across the country to sell its
oranges.</P>
      <P>Last week, the Yunlin county government launched an "Orange Day" activity from
Dec. 15 - Jan. 25, a period during which Taiwanese consumers can buy fine-
quality Yunlin oranges at 120 specially designated venues across the country.</P>
      <P>Yunlin authorities have also managed to sell the produce to overseas markets,
including China, Southeast Asia, Europe and the United States.</P>
      <P>Last month, China ordered 1,200 metric tons of Taiwanese oranges at above market
prices of NT$13 (US$0.4) per kilogram as a goodwill gesture during its top
negotiator Chen Yunlin's visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The first batch of the order was shipped to China on board a Taiwanese  vessel
on Monday when direct shipping  links were inaugurated.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan hopes to sign a financial memorandum of understanding (MOU) with China
covering the banking, securities and insurance sectors in the next round of
cross-strait talks, an official of the nation's top financial regulatory body
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lee Jih-chu, vice chairwoman of the Financial Supervisory Commission, noted that
the talks on the signing of an MOU on banking and securities have been going
smoothly.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that China requires the signing of an MOU before foreign, including
Taiwanese, financial institutions can engage in financial operations in China,
but the requirement only covers the banking and securities sectors, without
including the insurance sector.</P>
      <P>Despite Taiwan and China not having signed such an MOU, two Taiwanese insurance
companies - Cathay Life Insurance and Taiwan Life Insurance - have begun
insurance operations in China, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The MOU is expected to provide protection for Taiwanese companies operating in
China.</P>
      <P>Under Chinese law, foreign insurance institutions with at least US$5 billion
assets and 30 years of experience in the insurance sector and have set up
representative offices in China for at least two years can apply to set up
branches and engage in insurance operations.</P>
      <P>Currently four Taiwanese insurance companies meet the above requirement, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>Under the circumstances, Taiwanese insurance companies that enter China will be
big companies, and the FSC will definitely want to have access to information on
their operations in China, she added.</P>
      <P>"If an MOU is not signed between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, then the
FSC will be unable to regulate Taiwan's insurance companies operating in China,"
she added.</P>
      <P>Lee said that it has reached initial consensus with Beijing-based China
Insurance Regulatory Commission on covering the insurance sector in the MOU to
be signed between the two sides.</P>
      <P>But as the part on insurance sector is not as urgent as the banking and
securities sectors, Lee said she is not sure whether an MOU will eventually
cover this part.</P>
      <P>The FSC was established on July 1, 2004 to promote an integrated financial
supervision. The primary objectives of the commission are to consolidate the
supervision of the banking, securities and insurance sectors, and to act as a
single regulator for all of these industries.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China's COSCO Group, owner and operator of one of the largest container ships in
the world, is eyeing Kaohsiung  Harbor  as a transshipment  center to bolster
its transshipping and logistics services.</P>
      <P>The 10,000-TEU (20-foot equivalent unit) COSCO Oceania anchored at Kaohsiung
Harbor Wednesday after the historic inauguration of direct cross-Taiwan Strait
shipping links Monday, unloading around 50 containers and loading some 900
containers before heading for Hong Kong en route to Europe.</P>
      <P>The COSCO Oceania, the largest container ship in Asia and one of the largest in
the world, embarked from the Chinese port of Tianjin Monday and arrived at
Kaohsiung 55 hours later to become the first Chinese ship from Tianjin to visit
a Taiwanese port via direct shipping links since 1949.</P>
      <P>COSCO Group Chairman Wei Jiafu, who flew into Taiwan Monday to witness the
inauguration of the direct links, attended a cocktail reception at Kaohsiung
Harbor Thursday and said in an address that the COSCO Group is having an even
bigger container ship built -- a 13,500-TEU vessel to be named the "COSCO
Kaohsiung" -- which will ply its global routes with Kaohsiung  Harbor  as one of
its key transshipping points.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the reception, Kaohsiung Harbor Administration Director-General
Hsieh Ming-hui said the harbor's history will be rewritten when the COSCO
Kaohsiung makes its maiden voyage to Kaohsiung Harbor in 2010.</P>
      <P>Businessman Lee Wei-ying, who operates an export company and a customs brokerage
house in Kaohsiung, said Chinese commercial ships mostly carry out their
transshipment business via seaports in South Korea and Japan, but said Kaohsiung
will be a hot spot for them now that direct cross-strait shipping links have
been launched as they will want to capitalize on Kaohsiung's geographic
convenience and excellent harbor facilities.</P>
      <P>After a hiatus of nearly six decades, Taiwan and China resumed daily direct
passenger flights, direct cargo flights and direct shipping links Dec. 15, seen
by many as a step toward ending decades of hostility and cutting the cost of
travel and trade between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Ceremonies were held at seaports in China, as well as at Taiwan's Keelung,
Taichung and Kaohsiung harbors, to send off the first commercial vessels plying
the direct cross-strait routes.</P>
      <P>Ships will now be able to sail between 11 ports in Taiwan and 63 ports in China,

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to step up interactions with international NGOs: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 18 (CNA)
12/18/08  20:51:38

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that it will encourage
international  non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to set up offices in
Taiwan, as part its efforts to strengthen contacts and cooperation between such
groups and their Taiwanese counterparts.</P>
      <P>David Wu, vice chairman of the ministrys NGO Affairs Committee, told a media
gathering that Taiwan will modify relevant regulations to encourage more global
NGOs to be located here.</P>
      <P>Wu said it is his hope that the loosening of restrictions, including taxation
and length-of-stay rules for those working for the NGOs will enable Taiwan to
attract such organizations to set up their headquarters, regional branches or
secretariats here.</P>
      <P>"We wish to establish alliances with international non-profit organizations, "
said Wu, speaking at a gathering the ministry organized Thursday to tell
reporters about the results of Taiwan's participation in international NGO
affairs.</P>
      <P>Wu said Taiwan's NGOs are playing an ever- increasing role in the areas of human
rights, politics,  environmental protection and education.</P>
      <P>"We hope  to further  that  with their  participation  in international
affairs," he said.</P>
      <P>Wu said Taiwan will model itself after countries such as Thailand, where a large
number of international NGOs have operations, to formulate favorable laws
specifically targeting the groups.</P>
      <P>He did not elaborate on which groups Taiwan is trying to attract, but Taiwan has
long yearned for greater inclusion of the island in the activities of
international health, humanitarian, and other groups.</P>
      <P>One of the hopes of President Ma Ying-jeou in pursuing his policy of building
warmer ties with China is to convince China it is not against Beijing's interest
to give Taiwan more international space to operate, including in global non-
governmental groups.</P>
      <P>Beijing is opposed to Taiwan joining groups normally reserved for countries,
including the United Nation and World Health Organization. It is unclear whether
China will put up obstacles to Taiwan's desire for greater participation in non-
governmental groups.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu said that his committee invited the heads of 13 prominent
international NGOs to visit Taiwan in the past two months alone, including a
current visit by World Alliance for Citizen Participation Secretary General
Ingrid Narasimhan, to promote mutual understandings and facilitate cooperation.</P>
      <P>Wu said the ministry will at the same time provide assistance to Taiwanese NGOs
in their bids to host international conferences next year, build alliances with
global NGOs, as well as set up websites to share information.</P>
      <P>The ministry has already helped Taiwanese NGOs take part in international
conferences or activities, with finances provided to over 650 of them, Wu added.</P>
      <P>From just January to November, the MOFA assisted Taiwan's various NGOs to
participate in 2,028 international NGO events, Wu said.</P>
      <P>In the preface of a book released at the media gathering Thursday, Foreign
Minister Francisco H. L. Ou said that Taiwanese NGOs have come to play a vital
role in the past years in domestic public affairs, including human rights,
environment, public health, and humanitarian relief.</P>
      <P>Many of them, Ou said, have also reached out to those in need around the world
bearing theirLove from Taiwan" signs, which can be seen in many countries
suffering from natural disasters.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Ou said, the goal of Taiwan's NGOs to "Plant roots in Taiwan and
reach out globallyis no longer a dream, but has gradually become a reality.</P>
      <P>In 2000, the ministry established its NGO International Affairs Committee to
assist Taiwan's NGOs with elevating their profile on the international stage.</P>
      <P>The goal of the Committee is to serve as a liaison for various NGO international
affairs and to coordinate and integrate relevant resources  for  governmental
and civic  groups'  international participation.</P>

      <P>More people are expected to benefit from a temporary job creation program
sponsored by the government, with over 70 new plans added to the existing
project, the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD)
reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>The expansion is expected to help some 69,000 jobless workers find employment
under the program, an increase from the original estimate of about 56,000
people, CEPD officials said.</P>
      <P>To date, as many as 31,000 workers have found jobs through the six-month program
instigated by the Executive Yuan in November, the officials went on.</P>
      <P>With the additional plans to be added, the program's length will also be
prolonged until the end of next October, they added.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan approved funding of NT$10 billion (US$303 million) Oct.
31 to create the temporary jobs and help people in need as part of the
government's efforts to improve the slipping economy and growing unemployment

    <HEADLINE>Novel method of chaotic communication proposed by physicists</HEADLINE>

      <P>Two Taiwanese physicists have invented a new method of chaotic communication
that has proved better than the conventional ones in terms of fending off
intrusions and external noise, academic sources reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>The duo, both of whom are research fellows at Academia Sinica's Institute of
Physics, uses the message carriers themselves as binary codes rather than hiding
the message in the carrier, to achieve higher transmission security, according
to a press release from Taiwan's top research institute.</P>
      <P>On the receiver side, according to the press release, the user can analyze the
code-embedded carriers to decrypt the message by using temporal transfer
entropy, a new technology developed by Hu Chin- kun and Hung Yao-chen.</P>
      <P>Hu explained  that chaotic communications  usually  involve interweaving a weak
message into a strong chaotic carrier -- protecting the message with the help of
the carrier's randomness and disorderliness.</P>
      <P>However, the method has become antiquated since the realization of time-series
analysis, Hu continued, adding that the development necessitates a more secure
communication method, such as nonlinear encryption.</P>
      <P>In addition to use in communications, Hu went on, temporal transfer entropy can
also be applied to many different scientific fields, such as neurophysiology,
economics and climatology.</P>
      <P>Their research paper on the topic -- titled Chaotic Communication via Temporal
Transfer Entropy -- has been published in the Dec. 12 issue of Physical Review
Letters, a leading international physics journal.</P>

      <P>Taipei City will work toward further developing itself into an "intelligent
fiber city, " with wireless e-services to include tourism and transport
facilities, Mayor Hau Lung-bin announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hau made the remarks during a seminar organized by the Mount Jade Science and
Technology Association of Taiwan, saying that an overall plan for digital
construction and application of digital technology will "make the city full of
immense possibilities."</P>
      <P>The new e- services under discussion, he went on, will include guides on the
city's cycle paths and tourist attractions and notification of bus timetables,
as well as information on car parking -- an expansion from the city's current
offerings via wireless applications.</P>
      <P>The mayor cited the 1999 free hotline provided by the city government  as an
example,  saying  that  through  synchronous computer-based processes, the
government is able to respond to reports such as malfunctioning streetlamps or
illegal parking with "on-the-spot limited-time solutions."</P>
      <P>The city has also adopted digital technology in its disaster response system and
public security network, Hau added, while stressing that e-services, in
categories such as e-Government, e-Community and e-Life, will help increase
administrative efficiency and facilitate more prompt assistance to the city's
residents</P>
      <P>He said Taipei's efforts to establish itself into an "intelligent fiber city"
have gained global recognition and have been chosen as the model for the
wireless and broadband city at the World Expo to be held in Shanghai in 2010.</P>
      <P>According to the organizer, Taipei won top prize for the Intelligent Community
Awards in 2006 and was also certified as the world's largest Wi-Fi network city

    <HEADLINE>President appeals to businesses to refrain from `excessive' layoffs</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou appealed to the business and industrial sectors Thursday
to refrain from making "excessive" numbers of employees redundant.</P>
      <P>"Employees will work themselves to the bone for their companies if they are
retained in this wave of global economic crisis, which is triggering a spate of
layoffs," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Addressing a ceremony marking the establishment of the Taiwan Electrical
Commercial Association, Ma quoted the results of business research as indicating
that it costs a company more to hire a new employee after making an existing one
redundant.</P>
      <P>Ma reiterated that in the face of the economic downturn, his administration is
doing its utmost to help banking institutions pull their weight in the hope that
the banks will in turn help businesses, while businesses should therefore offer
opportunities for their employees.</P>
      <P>He added that to improve employment, the administration has planned to make some
110,000 jobs available before next October and will create around 200,000 job
openings in the ensuing four years.</P>
      <P>"I hope the business sector will invest more and that the private sector will
consume more, as the government has pulled out all the stops and used all the
resources at its disposal to rev up the economy," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Citing the north-central county of Miaoli and the central city of Taichung as
examples, Ma said the national electrical commercial association could emulate
these cities by capitalizing on the free shopping vouchers that the government
is set to distribute nationwide next month in a bid to boost consumption.</P>
      <P>The Miaoli county government will invest NT$10 million to capitalize on the
shopping voucher program. It has said that for each NT$5,000 spent that includes
the NT$3,600-worth of vouchers, shoppers in Miaoli will be entitled to a ticket
for lucky draws. Prizes up for grabs will be 10 luxury cars, 100 TFT-LED TV
sets, scores of refrigerators and many other hi-tech health and entertainment
gear.</P>
      <P>The Taichung city government has offered similar incentives to lure spenders to
the city, with its top prize being an upscale downtown apartment.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An army CH-47SD helicopter crashed into a ditch in a mountainous training
battleground near Cishan township in the southern county of Kaohsiung Thursday,
injuring five officers aboard, a Defense Ministry statement confirmed later that
day.</P>
      <P>Five airborne transport battalion officers were aboard the twin-turbine, tandem-
rotor transport rotorcraft that took off from the Army Aviation and Special
Forces Command (AASFC) 's Gueiren base in neighboring Tainan County at 10 a.m.
for a routine training flight.</P>
      <P>Only two of the injured officers, identified as Chen Chien-yu, a technician, and
Wang Huang-kun, a non-commissioned officer, remained in Kaohsiung Military
General Hospital for treatment of their injuries, including bone fractures and
lacerations, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The other three -- pilot Maj.Wu Cheng-wang, co-pilot Maj.Lin Si-yi and Lt.Col.
Shen Hsiao-hsing, an inspector, -- returned to the Gueiren base after treatment,
the statement said.</P>
      <P>Initial investigations show that the helicopter crashed into a ditch on the east
wing of the training battlefield, located south of Jhongliao mountain in Cishan,
the statement said.</P>
      <P>The chopper's two propellers were broken and the turbines and fuselage were
seriously damaged. As the crash site is in a remote mountainous region, the
Kaohsiung county fire department had to seek military assistance to get to the
area.</P>
      <P>According to Col. Huang Kuo-ming, commander of the Aviation and Special Forces
Command's flight training division, the mountainous training battlefield has
been in service for more than 10 years.</P>
      <P>The pilot of the ill-fated plane recalled that the helicopter landed at the
battleground without incident, but he discovered that the No. 2 engine seemed to
lose power for about 30 seconds when the helicopter took off again and had
reached an altitude of 50 feet, whereupon he lost control and the aircraft
crashed.</P>
      <P>The AASFC currently has another eight helicopters of the same type. They were
all imported in 1998 from the United States. The Defense Ministry statement said
they will all be grounded pending investigations into the cause of the crash.</P>
      <P>The CH-47SD, the latest version of the Chinook, features several new or improved
components and systems that enhance capabilities while reducing operating and
support costs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLA receives growing complaints about unpaid leave</HEADLINE>

12/18/08  22:24:09

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said Thursday that it has received a sharp
increase in the number of complaints about unpaid leave amid the economic
downturn.</P>
      <P>The CLA said it used to receive around 10 complaints a day, but noted that the
number has ballooned to between 40 and 50 per day over the past month, with most
of the complaints involving the issue of unpaid leave.</P>
      <P>The main complaint is that unpaid leave is tantamount to a wage cut, leaving
workers worried that the next step could be a layoff.</P>
      <P>But one complaint has stood out among the deluge of other complaints, CLA
officials said, adding that it came from workers for a solar battery
manufacturer who complained that the company has recently frequently asked them
to work overtime and for long hours. Although the employer pays them for the
overtime, the workers said the additional workload is too tiring and asked the
CLA to visit the company for an inspection.</P>
      <P>"In fact, the staff of several high-tech companies complained to the CLA a few
months ago that their companies had been asking them to work overtime in
violation of the law," a labor official said.</P>
      <P>However, the rapid change in the economic situation over the past two months has
seen the situation "turn in the opposite direction, " he added.</P>
      <P>With orders received dropping sharply, there is now no overtime, and working
hours have been greatly reduced.</P>
      <P>Labor groups estimate that more than 20 high-tech companies have implemented
unpaid leave and have asked the CLA to take the initiative to learn more about
the situation.</P>
      <P>The official said that if unpaid leave is implemented without prior coordination
between management and labor, employers can be fined up to NT$60,000 (US$1,880).</P>
      <P>He also clarified a recent CLA decision that if enterprises impose unpaid leave,
the pay should not be lower than the minimum monthly wage of NT$17,280.</P>
      <P>"Unpaid leave cannot be decided by the employers unilaterally but should be the
result of prior communication with the workforce, " the official said.</P>
      <P>According to Youth Labor Union 95, a labor group, most high-tech manufacturers
have asked staff to take one day of unpaid leave per week, although the worst
scenario is unlimited unpaid leave, with workers asked to return to their posts
only if orders are received.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's first college of photonics, located in the southern county of Tainan,
will start operations next year as a cradle for industry personnel, a local
official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The college, set up in the Tainan branch of National Chiao Tung University
(NCTU), is in the county's Gueiren township, close to the Taiwan High Speed
Rail's Tainan Station.</P>
      <P>NCTU's main campus is in Hsinchu City in northern Taiwan, where it already has a
department of photonics consisting of one department and two graduate
institutes.</P>
      <P>The university's college-level Tainan branch, construction of which began in
2005, will have a total of five graduate institutes within five years to
cultivate photonics talent for the county, which also houses the Tainan Science
Park and many other industrial areas.</P>
      <P>Three already-built graduate institutes will start enrolling students next year
in photonics engineering, lighting and energy, and biomedical photonics
technology, the official said.</P>
      <P>NCTU wants the branch to become one of the world's top institutes in terms of
developing photonics personnel and hopes to set up a lab to develop core
technology for relevant industries, according to an NCTU executive.</P>
      <P>The executive pointed out that Taiwan will have about 106,600 job vacancies in
technology industries in the coming three years, including 35,800 in the
semiconductor sector and 17,000 in the image display  sector,  with  other
vacancies  in digital  content, biotechnology and communications.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that academic training at the college will help students better
prepare for future job opportunities, as those who have masters or doctoral

      <P>The Taipei District Court rejected Thursday a request by prosecutors to detain
former President Chen Shui-bian again.</P>
      <P>In its second ruling in six days on the issue, the panel of three judges at the
court stood by its decision last Saturday to free Chen on his own recognizance,
a ruling that prosecutors are likely to see as detrimental to their
investigation into other criminal activities in which Chen is allegedly
involved.</P>
      <P>The district court handed down the ruling after the Taiwan High Court Wednesday
allowed an appeal by prosecutors from the Special Investigation Division under
the Supreme Prosecutors Office for the court to review its earlier decision to
free Chen.</P>
      <P>In the appeal presented to the Taiwan High Court Tuesday, the prosecutors noted
that they will soon begin to investigate several other corruption cases
allegedly involving Chen and his wife.</P>
      <P>If Chen is allowed to remain free, the prosecutors argued, some of the
witnesses, including three of his former close aides, might not dare to tell the
truth.</P>
      <P>In its previous ruling Dec. 13, the court ordered that Chen, who was detained
Nov. 12, be released without bail following his indictment, along with 13 other
people, on charges of embezzlement, corruption and money laundering.</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife are accused of siphoning off NT$104 million (US$3.12 million)
from a special Presidential Office discretionary fund during his presidency from
2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>They are also charged with accepting bribes worth NT$100 million and NT$200
million in connection with a land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million
in kickbacks to help a contractor win the tender for a government construction
project, according to the indictment.</P>

      <P>According  to the statement,  customs  officers  discovered suspicious
substances when they X-rayed eight cases of articles that were shipped from the
southern Chinese city of Guangzhou via a China Southern Airlines cargo charter
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The articles were declared on the flight manifesto as hair decorations, but the
ketamine -- a third-grade contraband drug -- was found concealed in the cases.</P>
      <P>The Aviation Police Bureau formed a special team to investigate the case and

the smuggling.</P>
      <P>Police said the woman, identified only by her family name of Gong, denied being

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to step up interactions with international NGOs: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 18 (CNA)
12/18/08  20:51:38
(By Jian Chen and Andrew Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that it will encourage
international  non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to set up offices in
Taiwan, as part its efforts to strengthen contacts and cooperation between such
groups and their Taiwanese counterparts.</P>
      <P>David Wu, vice chairman of the ministrys NGO Affairs Committee, told a media
gathering that Taiwan will modify relevant regulations to encourage more global
NGOs to be located here.</P>
      <P>Wu said it is his hope that the loosening of restrictions, including taxation
and length-of-stay rules for those working for the NGOs will enable Taiwan to
attract such organizations to set up their headquarters, regional branches or
secretariats here.</P>
      <P>"We wish to establish alliances with international non-profit organizations, "
said Wu, speaking at a gathering the ministry organized Thursday to tell
reporters about the results of Taiwan's participation in international NGO
affairs.</P>
      <P>Wu said Taiwan's NGOs are playing an ever- increasing role in the areas of human
rights, politics,  environmental protection and education.</P>
      <P>"We hope  to further  that  with their  participation  in international
affairs," he said.</P>
      <P>Wu said Taiwan will model itself after countries such as Thailand, where a large
number of international NGOs have operations, to formulate favorable laws
specifically targeting the groups.</P>
      <P>He did not elaborate on which groups Taiwan is trying to attract, but Taiwan has
long yearned for greater inclusion of the island in the activities of
international health, humanitarian, and other groups.</P>
      <P>One of the hopes of President Ma Ying-jeou in pursuing his policy of building
warmer ties with China is to convince China it is not against Beijing's interest
to give Taiwan more international space to operate, including in global non-
governmental groups.</P>
      <P>Beijing is opposed to Taiwan joining groups normally reserved for countries,
including the United Nation and World Health Organization. It is unclear whether
China will put up obstacles to Taiwan's desire for greater participation in non-
governmental groups.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu said that his committee invited the heads of 13 prominent
international NGOs to visit Taiwan in the past two months alone, including a
current visit by World Alliance for Citizen Participation Secretary General
Ingrid Narasimhan, to promote mutual understandings and facilitate cooperation.</P>
      <P>Wu said the ministry will at the same time provide assistance to Taiwanese NGOs
in their bids to host international conferences next year, build alliances with
global NGOs, as well as set up websites to share information.</P>
      <P>The ministry has already helped Taiwanese NGOs take part in international
conferences or activities, with finances provided to over 650 of them, Wu added.</P>
      <P>From just January to November, the MOFA assisted Taiwan's various NGOs to
participate in 2,028 international NGO events, Wu said.</P>
      <P>In the preface of a book released at the media gathering Thursday, Foreign
Minister Francisco H. L. Ou said that Taiwanese NGOs have come to play a vital
role in the past years in domestic public affairs, including human rights,
environment, public health, and humanitarian relief.</P>
      <P>Many of them, Ou said, have also reached out to those in need around the world
bearing theirLove from Taiwan" signs, which can be seen in many countries
suffering from natural disasters.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Ou said, the goal of Taiwan's NGOs to "Plant roots in Taiwan and
reach out globallyis no longer a dream, but has gradually become a reality.</P>
      <P>In 2000, the ministry established its NGO International Affairs Committee to
assist Taiwan's NGOs with elevating their profile on the international stage.</P>
      <P>The goal of the Committee is to serve as a liaison for various NGO international
affairs and to coordinate and integrate relevant resources  for  governmental
and civic  groups'  international participation.</P>

      <P>More people are expected to benefit from a temporary job creation program
sponsored by the government, with over 70 new plans added to the existing
project, the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD)
reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>The expansion is expected to help some 69,000 jobless workers find employment
under the program, an increase from the original estimate of about 56,000
people, CEPD officials said.</P>
      <P>To date, as many as 31,000 workers have found jobs through the six-month program
instigated by the Executive Yuan in November, the officials went on.</P>
      <P>With the additional plans to be added, the program's length will also be
prolonged until the end of next October, they added.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan approved funding of NT$10 billion (US$303 million) Oct.
31 to create the temporary jobs and help people in need as part of the
government's efforts to improve the slipping economy and growing unemployment
rate.</P>
      <P>The short-term jobs offered in the program are mainly in the public sector,

    <HEADLINE>Novel method of chaotic communication proposed by physicists</HEADLINE>

      <P>Two Taiwanese physicists have invented a new method of chaotic communication
that has proved better than the conventional ones in terms of fending off
intrusions and external noise, academic sources reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>The duo, both of whom are research fellows at Academia Sinica's Institute of
Physics, uses the message carriers themselves as binary codes rather than hiding
the message in the carrier, to achieve higher transmission security, according
to a press release from Taiwan's top research institute.</P>
      <P>On the receiver side, according to the press release, the user can analyze the
code-embedded carriers to decrypt the message by using temporal transfer
entropy, a new technology developed by Hu Chin- kun and Hung Yao-chen.</P>
      <P>Hu explained  that chaotic communications  usually  involve interweaving a weak
message into a strong chaotic carrier -- protecting the message with the help of
the carrier's randomness and disorderliness.</P>
      <P>However, the method has become antiquated since the realization of time-series
analysis, Hu continued, adding that the development necessitates a more secure
communication method, such as nonlinear encryption.</P>
      <P>In addition to use in communications, Hu went on, temporal transfer entropy can
also be applied to many different scientific fields, such as neurophysiology,
economics and climatology.</P>
      <P>Their research paper on the topic -- titled Chaotic Communication via Temporal
Transfer Entropy -- has been published in the Dec. 12 issue of Physical Review
Letters, a leading international physics journal.</P>

      <P>Taipei City will work toward further developing itself into an "intelligent
fiber city, " with wireless e-services to include tourism and transport
facilities, Mayor Hau Lung-bin announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hau made the remarks during a seminar organized by the Mount Jade Science and
Technology Association of Taiwan, saying that an overall plan for digital
construction and application of digital technology will "make the city full of
immense possibilities."</P>
      <P>The new e- services under discussion, he went on, will include guides on the
city's cycle paths and tourist attractions and notification of bus timetables,
as well as information on car parking -- an expansion from the city's current
offerings via wireless applications.</P>
      <P>The mayor cited the 1999 free hotline provided by the city government  as an
example,  saying  that  through  synchronous computer-based processes, the
government is able to respond to reports such as malfunctioning streetlamps or
illegal parking with "on-the-spot limited-time solutions."</P>
      <P>The city has also adopted digital technology in its disaster response system and
public security network, Hau added, while stressing that e-services, in
categories such as e-Government, e-Community and e-Life, will help increase
administrative efficiency and facilitate more prompt assistance to the city's
residents</P>
      <P>He said Taipei's efforts to establish itself into an "intelligent fiber city"
have gained global recognition and have been chosen as the model for the
wireless and broadband city at the World Expo to be held in Shanghai in 2010.</P>
      <P>According to the organizer, Taipei won top prize for the Intelligent Community

    <HEADLINE>President appeals to businesses to refrain from `excessive' layoffs</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  18 (CNA)
12/18/08  21:55:22
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou appealed to the business and industrial sectors Thursday
to refrain from making "excessive" numbers of employees redundant.</P>
      <P>"Employees will work themselves to the bone for their companies if they are
retained in this wave of global economic crisis, which is triggering a spate of
layoffs," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Addressing a ceremony marking the establishment of the Taiwan Electrical
Commercial Association, Ma quoted the results of business research as indicating
that it costs a company more to hire a new employee after making an existing one
redundant.</P>
      <P>Ma reiterated that in the face of the economic downturn, his administration is
doing its utmost to help banking institutions pull their weight in the hope that
the banks will in turn help businesses, while businesses should therefore offer
opportunities for their employees.</P>
      <P>He added that to improve employment, the administration has planned to make some
110,000 jobs available before next October and will create around 200,000 job
openings in the ensuing four years.</P>
      <P>"I hope the business sector will invest more and that the private sector will
consume more, as the government has pulled out all the stops and used all the
resources at its disposal to rev up the economy," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Citing the north-central county of Miaoli and the central city of Taichung as
examples, Ma said the national electrical commercial association could emulate
these cities by capitalizing on the free shopping vouchers that the government
is set to distribute nationwide next month in a bid to boost consumption.</P>
      <P>The Miaoli county government will invest NT$10 million to capitalize on the
shopping voucher program. It has said that for each NT$5,000 spent that includes
the NT$3,600-worth of vouchers, shoppers in Miaoli will be entitled to a ticket
for lucky draws. Prizes up for grabs will be 10 luxury cars, 100 TFT-LED TV
sets, scores of refrigerators and many other hi-tech health and entertainment
gear.</P>
      <P>The Taichung city government has offered similar incentives to lure spenders to
the city, with its top prize being an upscale downtown apartment.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An army CH-47SD helicopter crashed into a ditch in a mountainous training
battleground near Cishan township in the southern county of Kaohsiung Thursday,
injuring five officers aboard, a Defense Ministry statement confirmed later that
day.</P>
      <P>Five airborne transport battalion officers were aboard the twin-turbine, tandem-
rotor transport rotorcraft that took off from the Army Aviation and Special
Forces Command (AASFC) 's Gueiren base in neighboring Tainan County at 10 a.m.
for a routine training flight.</P>
      <P>Only two of the injured officers, identified as Chen Chien-yu, a technician, and
Wang Huang-kun, a non-commissioned officer, remained in Kaohsiung Military
General Hospital for treatment of their injuries, including bone fractures and
lacerations, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The other three -- pilot Maj.Wu Cheng-wang, co-pilot Maj.Lin Si-yi and Lt.Col.
Shen Hsiao-hsing, an inspector, -- returned to the Gueiren base after treatment,
the statement said.</P>
      <P>Initial investigations show that the helicopter crashed into a ditch on the east
wing of the training battlefield, located south of Jhongliao mountain in Cishan,
the statement said.</P>
      <P>The chopper's two propellers were broken and the turbines and fuselage were
seriously damaged. As the crash site is in a remote mountainous region, the
Kaohsiung county fire department had to seek military assistance to get to the
area.</P>
      <P>According to Col. Huang Kuo-ming, commander of the Aviation and Special Forces
Command's flight training division, the mountainous training battlefield has
been in service for more than 10 years.</P>
      <P>The pilot of the ill-fated plane recalled that the helicopter landed at the
battleground without incident, but he discovered that the No. 2 engine seemed to
lose power for about 30 seconds when the helicopter took off again and had
reached an altitude of 50 feet, whereupon he lost control and the aircraft
crashed.</P>
      <P>The AASFC currently has another eight helicopters of the same type. They were
all imported in 1998 from the United States. The Defense Ministry statement said
they will all be grounded pending investigations into the cause of the crash.</P>
      <P>The CH-47SD, the latest version of the Chinook, features several new or improved
components and systems that enhance capabilities while reducing operating and
support costs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLA receives growing complaints about unpaid leave</HEADLINE>

12/18/08  22:24:09

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said Thursday that it has received a sharp
increase in the number of complaints about unpaid leave amid the economic
downturn.</P>
      <P>The CLA said it used to receive around 10 complaints a day, but noted that the
number has ballooned to between 40 and 50 per day over the past month, with most
of the complaints involving the issue of unpaid leave.</P>
      <P>The main complaint is that unpaid leave is tantamount to a wage cut, leaving
workers worried that the next step could be a layoff.</P>
      <P>But one complaint has stood out among the deluge of other complaints, CLA
officials said, adding that it came from workers for a solar battery
manufacturer who complained that the company has recently frequently asked them
to work overtime and for long hours. Although the employer pays them for the
overtime, the workers said the additional workload is too tiring and asked the
CLA to visit the company for an inspection.</P>
      <P>"In fact, the staff of several high-tech companies complained to the CLA a few
months ago that their companies had been asking them to work overtime in
violation of the law," a labor official said.</P>
      <P>However, the rapid change in the economic situation over the past two months has
seen the situation "turn in the opposite direction, " he added.</P>
      <P>With orders received dropping sharply, there is now no overtime, and working
hours have been greatly reduced.</P>
      <P>Labor groups estimate that more than 20 high-tech companies have implemented
unpaid leave and have asked the CLA to take the initiative to learn more about
the situation.</P>
      <P>The official said that if unpaid leave is implemented without prior coordination
between management and labor, employers can be fined up to NT$60,000 (US$1,880).</P>
      <P>He also clarified a recent CLA decision that if enterprises impose unpaid leave,
the pay should not be lower than the minimum monthly wage of NT$17,280.</P>
      <P>"Unpaid leave cannot be decided by the employers unilaterally but should be the
result of prior communication with the workforce, " the official said.</P>
      <P>According to Youth Labor Union 95, a labor group, most high-tech manufacturers
have asked staff to take one day of unpaid leave per week, although the worst
scenario is unlimited unpaid leave, with workers asked to return to their posts
only if orders are received.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's first college of photonics, located in the southern county of Tainan,
will start operations next year as a cradle for industry personnel, a local
official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The college, set up in the Tainan branch of National Chiao Tung University
(NCTU), is in the county's Gueiren township, close to the Taiwan High Speed
Rail's Tainan Station.</P>
      <P>NCTU's main campus is in Hsinchu City in northern Taiwan, where it already has a
department of photonics consisting of one department and two graduate
institutes.</P>
      <P>The university's college-level Tainan branch, construction of which began in
2005, will have a total of five graduate institutes within five years to
cultivate photonics talent for the county, which also houses the Tainan Science
Park and many other industrial areas.</P>
      <P>Three already-built graduate institutes will start enrolling students next year
in photonics engineering, lighting and energy, and biomedical photonics
technology, the official said.</P>
      <P>NCTU wants the branch to become one of the world's top institutes in terms of
developing photonics personnel and hopes to set up a lab to develop core
technology for relevant industries, according to an NCTU executive.</P>
      <P>The executive pointed out that Taiwan will have about 106,600 job vacancies in
technology industries in the coming three years, including 35,800 in the
semiconductor sector and 17,000 in the image display  sector,  with  other
vacancies  in digital  content, biotechnology and communications.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that academic training at the college will help students better
prepare for future job opportunities, as those who have masters or doctoral
degrees are much more likely to fill these vacancies.</P>

      <P>The Taipei District Court rejected Thursday a request by prosecutors to detain
former President Chen Shui-bian again.</P>
      <P>In its second ruling in six days on the issue, the panel of three judges at the
court stood by its decision last Saturday to free Chen on his own recognizance,
a ruling that prosecutors are likely to see as detrimental to their
investigation into other criminal activities in which Chen is allegedly
involved.</P>
      <P>The district court handed down the ruling after the Taiwan High Court Wednesday
allowed an appeal by prosecutors from the Special Investigation Division under
the Supreme Prosecutors Office for the court to review its earlier decision to
free Chen.</P>
      <P>In the appeal presented to the Taiwan High Court Tuesday, the prosecutors noted
that they will soon begin to investigate several other corruption cases
allegedly involving Chen and his wife.</P>
      <P>If Chen is allowed to remain free, the prosecutors argued, some of the
witnesses, including three of his former close aides, might not dare to tell the
truth.</P>
      <P>In its previous ruling Dec. 13, the court ordered that Chen, who was detained
Nov. 12, be released without bail following his indictment, along with 13 other
people, on charges of embezzlement, corruption and money laundering.</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife are accused of siphoning off NT$104 million (US$3.12 million)
from a special Presidential Office discretionary fund during his presidency from
2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>They are also charged with accepting bribes worth NT$100 million and NT$200
million in connection with a land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million
in kickbacks to help a contractor win the tender for a government construction
project, according to the indictment.</P>

      <P>According  to the statement,  customs  officers  discovered suspicious
substances when they X-rayed eight cases of articles that were shipped from the
southern Chinese city of Guangzhou via a China Southern Airlines cargo charter
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The articles were declared on the flight manifesto as hair decorations, but the
ketamine -- a third-grade contraband drug -- was found concealed in the cases.</P>
      <P>The Aviation Police Bureau formed a special team to investigate the case and

the smuggling.</P>
      <P>Police said the woman, identified only by her family name of Gong, denied being

(NCTU), is in the county's Gueiren township, close to the Taiwan High Speed
Rail's Tainan Station.</P>
      <P>NCTU's main campus is in Hsinchu City in northern Taiwan, where it already has a
department of photonics consisting of one department and two graduate
institutes.</P>
      <P>The university's college-level Tainan branch, construction of which began in
2005, will have a total of five graduate institutes within five years to
cultivate photonics talent for the county, which also houses the Tainan Science
Park and many other industrial areas.</P>
      <P>Three already-built graduate institutes will start enrolling students next year
in photonics engineering, lighting and energy, and biomedical photonics
technology, the official said.</P>
      <P>NCTU wants the branch to become one of the world's top institutes in terms of
developing photonics personnel and hopes to set up a lab to develop core
technology for relevant industries, according to an NCTU executive.</P>
      <P>The executive pointed out that Taiwan will have about 106,600 job vacancies in
technology industries in the coming three years, including 35,800 in the
semiconductor sector and 17,000 in the image display  sector,  with  other
vacancies  in digital  content, biotechnology and communications.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that academic training at the college will help students better
prepare for future job opportunities, as those who have masters or doctoral
degrees are much more likely to fill these vacancies.</P>

      <P>The Taipei District Court rejected Thursday a request by prosecutors to detain
former President Chen Shui-bian again.</P>
      <P>In its second ruling in six days on the issue, the panel of three judges at the
court stood by its decision last Saturday to free Chen on his own recognizance,
a ruling that prosecutors are likely to see as detrimental to their
investigation into other criminal activities in which Chen is allegedly
involved.</P>
      <P>The district court handed down the ruling after the Taiwan High Court Wednesday
allowed an appeal by prosecutors from the Special Investigation Division under
the Supreme Prosecutors Office for the court to review its earlier decision to
free Chen.</P>
      <P>In the appeal presented to the Taiwan High Court Tuesday, the prosecutors noted
that they will soon begin to investigate several other corruption cases
allegedly involving Chen and his wife.</P>
      <P>If Chen is allowed to remain free, the prosecutors argued, some of the
witnesses, including three of his former close aides, might not dare to tell the
truth.</P>
      <P>In its previous ruling Dec. 13, the court ordered that Chen, who was detained
Nov. 12, be released without bail following his indictment, along with 13 other
people, on charges of embezzlement, corruption and money laundering.</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife are accused of siphoning off NT$104 million (US$3.12 million)
from a special Presidential Office discretionary fund during his presidency from
2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>They are also charged with accepting bribes worth NT$100 million and NT$200
million in connection with a land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million
in kickbacks to help a contractor win the tender for a government construction
project, according to the indictment.</P>

      <P>Aviation police have seized an express delivery containing 30 kg of ketamine
that was smuggled aboard a direct all-cargo charter flight across the Taiwan
Strait, the Aviation Police Bureau said in a statement Thursday.</P>
      <P>According  to the statement,  customs  officers  discovered suspicious
substances when they X-rayed eight cases of articles that were shipped from the
southern Chinese city of Guangzhou via a China Southern Airlines cargo charter
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The articles were declared on the flight manifesto as hair decorations, but the
ketamine -- a third-grade contraband drug -- was found concealed in the cases.</P>
      <P>The Aviation Police Bureau formed a special team to investigate the case and
based on the address on the shipment, traced a man in Changhua City in central
Taiwan and arrested his wife, a Chinese citizen suspected of being involved in
the smuggling.</P>
      <P>Police said the woman, identified only by her family name of Gong, denied being
aware of the drugs in the parcel, but police said they suspect she was lying
because she informed a man in China of her arrest via cell phone while
supposedly retaining the services of a lawyer during police questioning.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Expanded links not expected to boost southern economy immediately</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  19 (CNA)
12/19/08  15:06:31

    <TEXT>
      <P>Pingtung Magistrate Tsao Chi-hung said Friday that he does not see the launch of
direct air and sea links across the Taiwan Strait Dec. 15 producing positive
results overnight for business in Taiwan's southernmost county.</P>
      <P>Tsao said that although it is undeniable that the long-expected launch of cross-
strait direct daily charter flights, direct shipping and postal deliveries will
be a boon to Taiwan's agricultural and tourism sectors in the long run, the
results will not be immediately apparent.</P>
      <P>Taking his county's fruit exports to China as an example, Tsao said that despite
the convenience and time efficiency that the expanded direct links offer, fruit
exports from Pingtung County are not expected to instantly grow by leaps and
bounds.</P>
      <P>Tsao attributed his feelings mainly to the fact that fruit constitutes only a
very small portion of the typical Chinese diet, adding that it is unwise to
assume the Chinese will start consuming as much fruit as the Taiwanese do.</P>
      <P>He said Pingtung County had originally expected that the opening of direct air
and sea links would bring about an increased number of Chinese tourists, who in
turn would purchase fruit and other agricultural products from the county.</P>
      <P>"This idea also did not live up to our expectations instantly, " Tsao noted.</P>
      <P>Echoing Tsao's opinion, Tsai Shun-teh, chairman of the Taiwan Wax Apple
Development Association, noted that Taiwan has exported fresh, top-quality wax
apples -- also known as bell fruit -- to China for the past several years, but
all to upscale markets in Beijing or Shanghai.</P>
      <P>The Dec. 15 launch of direct air and sea links will quicken deliveries by about
one day, which will help prolong the fruit's shelf live in China and ensure
quality, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>The expanded links, however, are not expected to help Pingtung's bell fruit
growers to increase their top-shelf shipments to China because Chinese buyers of
such expensive fruit are not likely to increase  their purchases  simply because
of the opening  of cross-strait links, Tsai continued.</P>
      <P>"Only when we begin exporting medium-quality bell fruit to China in large
quantities will Pingtung's growers begin reap noticeably increased rewards, but
that day in still distant," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Bell fruit are a flagship agricultural product of Pingtung County, with sales to
markets in Taiwan and abroad increasing year on year.</P>
      <P>At present, most Taiwan-grown fruit is transported to China's southeastern port
city of Xiamen through the Taiwan-held islands of Kinmen and Matsu, a channel
considered as the most economical way in terms of both travel time and shipping
cost.</P>

      <P>Nearly half of Taiwan's Internet users are online shoppers, with the value of
their total purchases estimated at more than NT$85 billion (US$2.62 billion)
over the past year, according to the results of an annual survey on the
country's digital divide released Friday.</P>
      <P>The survey conducted by the Research, Development and Evaluation Commission
(RDEC) found that 49.5 percent of Internet users have made online purchases.</P>
      <P>Seventy-one  percent  of  the  online  shoppers  mentioned "convenience" as
their motivation for making online purchases, with the five most popular
products listed as clothing and accessories; books; hotel reservations and
flights, train and bus tickets; household items; and home electronics.</P>
      <P>The results revealed that on average, each online shopper spent NT$13,565 over
the past year.</P>
      <P>The survey was carried out between July 20 and Sept. 3 among 16,131 people via
telephone. It had a margin of error of 0.8 percentage points.</P>
      <P>Based on the results, the RDEC estimated that there are 13.71 million Internet
users aged 12 and older in Taiwan, up 700,000 from last year, with the increase
most obvious among the older segment of the population.</P>
      <P>The results show that 64.2 percent of those in the 41-50 age group are Internet
users, compared with 58.6 percent last year, while the rate of Internet use
among the 51-60 age group has risen from 35.5 percent to 40.5 percent.</P>
      <P>The results also show that web2.0 technology is popular among Internet users
under 30, especially those aged 15-20.</P>
      <P>Among users in this age group, 57.7 percent often visit their own blogs or those
of others, and that 35.1 percent do so occasionally.</P>
      <P>More than 60 percent of Internet users aged under 20 have set up their own
personal blogs, and young users are especially active in raising questions and
expressing their opinions on the Internet, according to the results.</P>
      <P>On the regional divide in terms of digitization, Hsinchu City, Taipei City and
Taichung City -- where more than 70 percent of residents have used the Internet
-- have been rated as the country's three most digitized cities.</P>
      <P>However, the rate of Internet use is lower than 60 percent among residents in
Pingtung County, Penghu County and Chiayi County, where farming is the dominant
economic activity and where there is a relatively large elderly population.</P>
      <P>The survey also discovered an obvious gender divide in terms of computer and
Internet access among those aged 50 and older, with the rate of computer and
Internet use among women lagging behind that of men by 7 percentage points to 10
percentage points.</P>

      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung said the consensus that will be
reached at the upcoming cross-Taiwan Strait Economic, Trade and Cultural Forum
will benefit both Taiwan and China, if implemented.</P>
      <P>Wu left for Shanghai Friday morning to participate in the Dec. 20-21 forum,
which will focus on establishing a mechanism for economic exchanges and
expanding cooperation in the financial and service sectors.</P>
      <P>I will make every effort so that the consensus of the forum will be to Taiwan's
advantage, said Wu before boarding the plane to Shanghai.Given the global
economic crisis, this forum is of great significance and importance to both
sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The trip marks the first time that a KMT chairman is attending the fourth such
forum between the KMT and the Communist Party of China as head of Taiwan's
ruling party.</P>
      <P>Wu, who is being accompanied by by government officials from the Council of
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) and the Financial Supervisory
Comission, said 140 people will participate in the conference.</P>
      <P>He predicted that by the end of the two-day meeting, the KMT and the CPC will
reach a common agenda on issues ranging from the establishment of a mechanism
for economic exchanges and the expansion of cooperation in the financial and
service sectors, to the promotion of cross-strait investments and cultural
exchanges.</P>
      <P>Wu said the "common agenda" will carry more weight this year because both the
CPC and the KMT are ruling parties this year.</P>
      <P>"The greatest difference between this forum and the previous one in April of
2007, is that in 2007, the KMT was Taiwan's opposition party, " Wu said.</P>
      <P>"The KMT could talk about issues and future policies but did not have the power
to implement them. Now, the KMT is the ruling party in Taiwan and therefore, has
the power to implement policies."</P>
      <P>Wu emphasized, however, that the KMT-CPC dialogue would not replace the official
communication channel between China and Taiwan established through the Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) and its counterpart in China, the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>"The KMT-CPC Forum is a platform for exchanging views. It is non-official, and
non-decision making. Although government officials are participating, its
purpose is to provide realistic solutions to issues," Wu said.</P>
      <P>KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan and KMT Vice Chairman Lin Feng-cheng, who are
already in China to celebrate the launch of direct shipping links between the
two countries, will proceed to Shanghai to attend the forum.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan on Friday passed the final reading of an amendment to the
Law on the Control of Communicable Diseases, which allows the establishment of a
national vaccine fund in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The fund, which is expected to be operational by 2009, will help improve health
care and public health in Taiwan, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under
the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) said in a statement.</P>
      <P>With the approved bill, the DOH will have a stable fund to use to pay for its
procurement of vaccines and will be able to ensure a stable supply of
inoculations.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the vaccine fund "will create more financial sources for
the purchase of vaccines, " said Lin Ying, the CDC's deputy director-general.</P>
      <P>Currently, financial support for vaccines come only from the government, and it
is not easy to increase the budget, Lin said.</P>
      <P>But in the near future after the national vaccine fund is set up, when the World
Health Organization suggests new vaccines to be listed as regular vaccines,
Taiwan will be able to keep pace with other countries in the area of
inoculation, Lin noted.</P>
      <P>Revenue for the vaccine fund will be drawn from government budgets, the health
and welfare charges on tobacco, as well as earnings from the pubic welfare
lottery and donations. But donors are not allowed to specify which vaccines
should be purchased from the fund.</P>
      <P>Decisions on what items to purchase will be made by a committee, which will also
evaluate the priority of vaccines to be purchased.</P>
      <P>Although the vaccine fund has yet to be created, Lin said that the budget to buy
vaccines next year has already been increased from NT$400 million to NT$528
million, with two more vaccines listed as regular vaccines: new three-in-one
vaccines for around 255,000 first grade students and streptococcus pneumoniae
vaccines for children under five years old, a high risk group for the disease.</P>

desire to keep Chen behind bars pending the trial.</P>
      <P>We have to give high confirmation to the judge for his morale courage,said DPP
Legislator Chiu Yi-ying.We also hope that Chen's case will proceed smoothly
without any interference.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Lee Chun-yee, however, criticized judges' request to the former
president to not threaten the witnesses involved in the case.</P>
      <P>This is an incredible assumption, said Lee.Former president Chen is not a rascal
nor gangster. It is impossible for him to do such a thing as threatening the
witnesses.</P>
      <P>Judges made the request to Chen due to arguments by the prosecutors that Chen,
if allowed to remain free while prosecutors' investigations are ongoing, will
try to influence the witnesses involved in the case.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors had argued that some of the witnesses and defendants, including
three of Chen's former close aides, might not dare to tell the truth unless Chen
was behind bars.</P>
      <P>As to the allegations from the prosecutors, Lee said thatthe prosecutors are
trying to make up strange and far-fetched reasons to persuade the judge to place
Chen back into custody.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court had rejected on Thursday a request by prosecutors to
detain Chen again.</P>
      <P>This was the second ruling in six days on the same case. The panel of three
judges at the court stood by its decision last Saturday to free Chen on his own
recognizance, a ruling that prosecutors are likely to see as detrimental to
their investigation into other criminal activities in which Chen is allegedly
involved.</P>
      <P>In its previous ruling on Dec. 13, the court had ordered that Chen, who was
first detained on Nov. 12, be released without bail following his indictment,
along with 13 other people, on charges of embezzlement, corruption and money
laundering.</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife are accused of siphoning off NT$104 million (US$3.12 million)
from a special Presidential Office discretionary fund during his presidency from
2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>They are also charged with accepting bribes worth NT$100 million and NT$200
million in connection with a land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million
in kickbacks to help a contractor win the tender for a government construction
project, according to the indictment.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese pharmaceutical company has signed a letter of intent (LOI) with a
Chinese company on forming a strategic alliance to ensure an adequate and steady
supply of Chinese herbal medicine to Taiwan's market, company officials said
Friday.</P>
      <P>The agreement was reached between Taipei City-based Scientific Pharmaceutical
Elite Company and Guangdong Kangmei Pharmaceutical Holding Co. at the closing in
Taipei City Thursday evening of a two-day cross-Taiwan Strait forum on
cooperation in herbal medicine and technical exchanges.</P>
      <P>The signing of the LOI was important to Taiwan as 90 percent of the country's
herbal medicine are imported from China. The quality of herbal medicine imported
from China, however, is uneven.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that the agreement will ensure not only the quantity but also the
quality that Taiwan needs.</P>
      <P>The agreement is expected to achieve three goals -- increase China's supplies of
herbal medicine to Taiwan, enable the companies to jointly develop new herbal
drugs, and allow the two companies mutual reciprocity in tapping the world
herbal medicine market.</P>
      <P>The Taipei company is one of the largest drug companies in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Two other agreements were also inked between the two companies: one on exchanges
and cooperation to develop the Chinese herbal medicine industry and the other on
joint research and development of Chinese herbal medicine.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has urged government officials to get to the bottom of
what causes people to take their own lives, as the number of people committing
suicide in Taiwan remains high.</P>
      <P>At a meeting with Taiwan LifeLine International President Lee Cheng-hsiung at
the Presidential Office Thursday, Ma said many factors cause mental disturbances
in a modern society.</P>
      <P>To help people overcome these various mental health problems, former President
Lee Teng-hui established a telephone hot line "1995" in the country's 23 cities
and counties during his term in office, a program that has saved many lives in
recent years, Ma said.</P>
      <P>An average of more than 110,000 calls are made to the hot line in search of help
annually, with the number of calls exceeding 120,000 last year, Ma said.</P>
      <P>The importance of the hot line is evident, given that suicide has been among the
top ten causes of death for the past 10 years, the president added.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health reported earlier this year that Taiwan's suicide
mortality rate dropped to 17.2 people out of every 100,000 in 2007, but it still
remained higher than the world average of 15 per 100,000 people.</P>
      <P>Also, more than 2,000 people have taken their own lives in Taiwan every year
since 1997, growing every year to a peak of 4,406 in 2006 before falling to
3,933 in 2007.</P>
      <P>Of the suicide deaths, there has been a big increase among the 25-45 age group,
Ma noted, citing statistics. He said people in the age bracket are supposed to
be full of vitality and represent the hope and future of the country, and them
giving up their lives represents a major loss to society.</P>
      <P>Attributing the increasing rate of suicide to the current adverse economic,
social and political situation, Ma urged the public to help address the problems
with love, patience and tolerance, while promising that the government will do
its utmost to help those with mental problems overcome their issues.</P>

      <P>Political appointees, military servicemen and senior executives of state-owned
enterprises will soon be allowed to visit China for business purposes or
sightseeing, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Friday.</P>
      <P>Liu made the announcement at a luncheon with reporters after being asked about
complaints by senior executives of state-owned companies that the restrictions
on visiting China have hurt their ability to drum up business.</P>
      <P>The premier said that the Ministry of the Interior and the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) -- a Cabinet-level body in charge of China policy planning -- have
reached a consensus on amending relevant regulations  to make it easier for
senior officials, state-owned enterprise executives and military servicemen to
take business or pleasure trips to China.</P>
      <P>At present, the three groups are only allowed to visit China on invitations from
international organizations, MAC Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun said later in the
day.</P>
      <P>In the future, the MAC official said, restrictions on the purposes of their
trips to China will be relaxed, but the details still have to be worked out.</P>
      <P>Liu Te-shun indicated,  however,  that a number of deputy ministerial-level
officials have already traveled to China on official business.</P>
      <P>In August this year, Minister of Education Cheng Jei-cheng and Minister-without-
Portfolio Ovid J. L. Tzeng also traveled to Beijing to attend the opening of the
2008 Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>But the MAC official acknowledged that the number of instances of ministerial-
level officials visiting China remained limited.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Chih-kung,  deputy  director-general  of the National Immigration Agency,
said the agency is working on a raft of amendments to the regulations governing
China-bound visits by civil servants and those with special status.</P>
      <P>"Liberalization is our guiding principle, " Hsieh said, adding that the package
will be referred to the Executive Yuan for approval when it is finalized.</P>
      <P>The once-icy relations across the Taiwan Strait have warmed since the May 20
inauguration of President Ma Ying-jeou, who has adopted a conciliatory approach
toward China.</P>
      <P>In the latest symbol of improved ties, direct air, shipping and postal links
took effect Dec. 15 to facilitate trade and civilian exchanges between Taiwan
and China.</P>
      <P>Relaxing restrictions on visits to China by government personnel is a matter of
course, government sources said.</P>

      <P>A crewman was killed and three others were poisoned Friday in an accident on a
Panama-registered cargo vessel sailing off the coast of Taiwan's northern county
of Hsinchu, rescue authorities said.</P>
      <P>According to the National Airborne Service Corps (NASC), the four victims --

transporting fuel coke.</P>

      <P>Terry Gou, one of the wealthiest people in Taiwan, signed a formal agreement on
Friday to donate NT$15 billion (US$461.2 million) to establish a hospital for
cancer patients and to conduct biomedical engineering research.</P>
      <P>Gou, who heads Hon Hai Precision Co. - one of the world's largest contract
electronics manufacturers, made the donation in his capacity as founder of the
Yonglin Foundation, a non-profit organization established by Gou and his late
wife Serena Lin in 2000 to conduct educational and charity missions.</P>
      <P>The money will go to National Taiwan University, which plans to build a
biomedical science park that can accommodate the planned 500-bed cancer
hospital, as well as a proton center for cancer treatment and a preventive
medicine center.</P>
      <P>Gou's wife died of breast cancer in 2005 and his younger brother died from
leukemia this July.</P>
      <P>Gou said he had never changed his mind about making the donation to NTU since he
first indicated he would do it in Sept. 4, 2007.</P>
      <P>As long as the planned cancer hospital achieves top world standards, his
donations to the hospital will only increase, Gou said.</P>
      <P>Charges by the hospital will be fair and affordable, he added.</P>
      <P>Gou said humbly that his donation is only "a small drop of water in a big pond."
Once the NTU cancer hospital becomes the world's top-notch cancer hospital, it
is expected to contribute to a structural change of Taiwan's medical resources
in a direction that boosts Taiwan's research in the prevention and control of
cancer diseases, and the development of the country's biomedical industry, he
added.</P>
      <P>NTU President Lee Si-chen accepted the donation on behalf of the university and
expressed his gratitude for the donation.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that the planned cancer hospital will be a separate hospital
from the university's National Taiwan University Hospital, although the two will
be overseen by the university management.</P>
      <P>In September 2007 when Gou signed a memorandum of understanding to make the
donation, he mentioned that the hospital will be a non-profit and public
interest medical care facility, and that the Yonglin Foundation will play a
major role in stem cell implant research and preventive medicine.</P>

      <P>Animal rescue vehicles fitted with flashing yellow lights hit the road Friday,
and an animal protection group urged the public to give them priority road
rights.</P>
      <P>The Life Caring and Animal Rescue Organization Taiwan introduced the new green
vehicles at a press conference and hoped they would help rescue animals that
would not have been reached quickly enough in the past to save.</P>
      <P>Though the animal protection group has rescued many stray dogs and cats over the
past four years, it has complained that due to legal restrictions that did not
allow animal rescue vehicles to have warning lights and road rights, they often
reached animals past the prime treatment period.</P>
      <P>After concerted efforts by animal protection groups, the Council of Agriculture
and the Ministry of Transportation and Communications approved regulations
governing animal rescue vehicles' special equipment and logo.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Councilman Chen Chien-ming touted the new regulations as "a major
step toward a more humane spirit."</P>
      <P>The vehicle will not only make rescue operations more efficient, but will also
protect the safety of rescue personnel, he said.</P>
      <P>He urged the public to join the dog and cat rescue mission and more importantly,
to give priority road rights when they see the green vehicles.</P>
      <P>The association, which relies solely on private donations, said money received
should be used for saving animals rather than to pay for the traffic tickets and
ambulance repair costs it amassed that will now be averted with the new
vehicles.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Renowned Taiwanese film director Hou Hsiao-hsien shaved his head Friday to
protest against the government's dismantling of aborigines' houses in Sansia
township, Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Hou shaved his head in a sit-in demonstration staged in front of the Taipei
Guest House aimed at attracting the media's attention to the demolition that has
left dozens of indigenous people homeless.</P>
      <P>Scores of indigenous people mainly from the Amis Tribe, whose houses in the
Sanying aboriginal community in Sansia had been dismantled by the Taipei county
government, also participated in the demonstration.</P>
      <P>Local indigenous people had been forced to relocate eight times over the past 30
years, according to Hou.</P>
      <P>"It's regretful that these people -- whose ancestors had lived on the Taipei
Basin at times earlier than the Chinese Han people and any of the first Western
immigrants in Taiwan had arrived -- have now been deprived of their basic rights
to residence, " Hou said.</P>
      <P>However, Chu Ching-yi, director of the Taipei county bureau of aboriginal
affairs, explained later that the indigenous community in Sansia was built
against the law on the flood plain of a river. Every time a typhoon approaches,
the county government must evacuate the residents for the sake of their safety.</P>
      <P>The indigenous dwellers' request for permission to "stay on where they live now"
violates the Water Act, Chu said.</P>
      <P>"Although the county government wants to take care of their wish, it cannot act
to violate the law," Chu said.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau, the illegal community under the Sanying Bridge consists
of around 23 households, with a total of 40-50 people, who mostly work as
carpenters.</P>
      <P>The best solution is to relocate them, according to the bureau.</P>
      <P>The county government said it has built a new residential area for the Sansia
indigenous people just 200 meters from where the illegal dwellings were
destroyed and that many indigenous residents had already moved into the
community.</P>
      <P>But Chiang Yi-hao, a consultant to the Sanying Community Self-Help Group, said
some of the Sanying Community dwellers could not move into the new residential
area because of household registration problems.</P>
      <P>Even if they manage to move in, Chiang added, they feel insecure about not
having a permanent home because they have to pay rent and they are allowed to
live there for only two years.</P>
      <P>Director Hou called for the government to show some respect to indigenous
people, particularly toward their way of living.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chiang urged the Taipei county government to first resume water and
electricity supplies to the community and to ask community members about their
needs before continuing with the demolitions.</P>
      <P>Chiang said all the aboriginal residents want is a piece of land for them to
build their homes to live in permanently, a humble desire that the Taipei county
government seemed to have paid a deaf ear to so far.</P>
      <P>Chiang called for President Ma Ying-jeou to "treat these people as people."</P>
      <P>Controversies surrounding the community had drawn criticism from Taiwanese
society and legislators after county government officials and policemen in March
forcibly tore down some of the houses that were illegally built near the area's
Dahan River several years ago.</P>
      <P>The county government said it demolished those illegal houses for water
conservation and river management purposes, but Chiang said a factory was built
there after some of the illegal houses were torn down.</P>
      <P>According to Chiang,  the county officials had disregarded protests from the
remaining tribe members and will continue their forcible demolition next week.</P>
      <P>A press statement issued by the county government late Friday said many of the
current residents in the Sanying community have moved there over the past year,
rather than being the originally documented dwellers.</P>
      <P>In consideration of their livelihoods, the statement added, demolition of
illegal structures there scheduled for next Tuesday will be postponed
indefinitely, and no such work will be carried out before the Lunar New Year,
which falls on Jan.26.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act to be reviewed by legislature next week</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of the Environmental Protection Administration on Friday pushed for
passage of landmark legislation on managing greenhouse gas emissions that he
said would serve as an important legal basis for Taiwan in adapting to climate
change.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan is expected to review the draft Greenhouse Gas Reduction
Act next week, which if approved would set up a system to control greenhouse gas
emissions and the trade in carbon credits to help reach government emission
reduction targets.</P>
      <P>EPA chief Shen Shu-hung publicly backed the bill after briefing President Ma
Ying-jeou on the year's achievements and key future environmental policy
challenges.</P>
      <P>According to the EPA, after hearing Shen's report, Ma said that in addition to
the current priority  of encouraging  domestic industries to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions, the Ministry of Economic Affairs should encourage large-scale
enterprises to acquire carbon credits abroad and figure carbon dioxide reduction
costs into industrial development costs as a whole.</P>
      <P>The GGRA draft was mapped out by the Cabinet-level EPA in 2006 to establish a
domestic legal framework to manage greenhouse gas emissions in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Legislators began to review the draft bill in committee earlier this year but
have yet to reach consensus on a number of clauses, including whether to put a
schedule of carbon reduction targets in the act.</P>
      <P>Once a political figure declares (his target), he has the duty to make efforts
to achieve it, " said Shen when asked about whether the target should be
included.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the carbon reduction targets have already been announced by the
president and was noted in the Sustainable Energy Policy Guidelines approved by
the Cabinet in June.</P>
      <P>In accordance to Ma's promises and the Guidelines, the government vowed to
maintain Taiwan's total greenhouse gas emissions at 2008 levels during 2016 and
2020, reduce the emissions to 2000 levels by 2025, halve the emissions from 2000
levels by 2050, and increase the low-carbon energy proportion of the country's
total energy supply to more than 55 percent by 2025.</P>
      <P>In order to promote voluntary emission reductions among private companies, the
EPA set up a national Greenhouse Gas Registry in 2007 to allow  enterprises  to
voluntarily  report  their  emission inventories.</P>
      <P>To date, 136 enterprises have registered their greenhouse gas emission data,
Shen said.</P>
      <P>At present, three "carbon-reduction" draft laws are all pending in the
Legislative Yuan for review, including the GGRA, the Statute on the Development
of Renewable Energy and the Energy Management Law.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Renowned Canadian environmental musician Matthew Lien hopes that his sunrise
concert on Alishan Jan. 1 will concentrate the attention of more local residents
on environmental issues.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Central News Agency on Friday, Lien said that with the
concert being held in an area where some precious animals and rare plants are
found, it will offerthe best wayfor the audience tothink about the natural
environment and cultures that we live with in this world.</P>
      <P>Though most people are currently caught up in the global economic downturn,
Lien stressed it was even more important to focus investment and government
attention on environmental degradation, as it is "far more serious and will have
far greater impact than our economy.</P>
      <P>That way, he went on, we could really do a lot to save, protect and revive our
ecology in the world.</P>
      <P>Lien said he finds the concertvery specialbecause it will take place as the sun
rises, which he felt was "much more meaningful" than most year-end performances
that begin late on New Year's Eve to usher in the new year.</P>
      <P>"The idea of opening a new year during a time when our Earth actually begins to
warm up and rolls into the sun at the first moment of light is a timeless event,
he said, adding that this is what people have been celebrating over many
generations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chung Fu-song, head of the Alishan National Scenic Area
Administration, one of the concert's organizers, also said at a press conference
earlier in the day that Lien's music will sit well with Alishan's beautiful
ecology andprovide a spiritual feastto the event participants.</P>
      <P>Alishan, one of Taiwan's most popular mountain resorts, will be the scene of two
concerts to ring in the new year. The first concert on Dec. 31, to be held at
the Alishan Tourist Service Center, features a band, singers and the Hamowana
Dancing Group of the indigenous Tsou Tribe.</P>
      <P>The second concert will take place in the early morning of Jan. 1 at the Jhushan
Helicopter Apron -- a favorite spot for tourists to watch the sunrise on Alishan
-- as the first gleam of sunlight of 2009 can be seen from there.</P>
      <P>The Jan. 1 concert will feature performances by Lien, who will play from 7: 20
a.m. to 8: 20 a.m. that day, as well as the Ten Drum Art Percussion Ensemble.</P>
      <P>According to the organizer, there will be an increase of train service to
coincide with the event, while those hoping to stay on the mountain the night
before are advised to book rooms in advance.</P>

      <P>A forest fire on Hsuehshan, also known as Snow Mountain, was put out Friday
afternoon, but not before four hectares of firs and arrow bamboo trees burned to
the ground.</P>
      <P>The fire on the 3,886-meter mountain in northern Taiwan was ignited Thursday
afternoon when a six-member mountain-climbing group raised a fire to alert a
rescue helicopter of the exact location of a injured climber, who fractured a
bone in a fall near a mountain lodge.</P>
      <P>While the injured climber surnamed Wu was taken by helicopter to a hospital in
Chiayi for treatment, the fire quickly spread.</P>
      <P>Local firefighters rushed to the scene, but hampered by a lack of water and the
mountainous winding terrain, they called on the Ministry of the Interior to send
a helicopter to help combat the blaze.</P>
      <P>A helicopter loaded with 26.4 tons of water flew two missions to the mountain
and sprayed the blaze from the air. The fire came under control Friday at noon
and was fully extinguished at 4: 51 p.m., but some rangers stayed on the scene
to prevent it from reigniting.</P>
      <P>Forestry Bureau officials said they will ask for compensation for the damage
done to the forest. Shei-Pa National Park police have also questioned members of
the mountain climbing team.</P>
      <P>For the safety of visitors, Shei-Pa National Park also announced that most of
the mountain trails will be temporarily closed to hikers.</P>

      <P>A senior official in charge of Taiwan's energy development said Friday the
legislature is expected to pass the draft Renewable Energy Development Bill at
its third reading before the current legislative session ends Jan. 13.</P>
      <P>Wang Yunn-Ming, deputy director of the Bureau of Energy under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs, said that the bill would authorize the government to provide
incentives to invest in power facilities and promote the use of renewable energy
up to a total installed capacity of 6.5 million kilowatts.</P>
      <P>The measure would guarantee a return on investment and strengthen the
willingness to invest in power generation using renewable energy. It would
establish mechanisms for the linking of renewable-energy generating facilities
to the power industry and for a guaranteed price for their electricity.</P>
      <P>Under the proposed law, large public construction projects in the future must
use solar energy to meet a stipulated percentage of their total energy
consumption.</P>
      <P>According to a Bureau of Energy estimate, once the Renewable Energy Development
bill becomes law, Taiwan's annual solar energy output could be increased from
2.8 million kilowatts in 2007 to 8.45 million kilowatts by 2025, accounting for
8 percent of Taiwan's total electricity generation capacity.</P>

      <P>A by-election will be held March 14 in Miaoli County's first electoral district
to fill the seat vacated by Lee I-tin, whose election was formally invalidated
because of vote-buying, the Central Election Commission (CEC) announced Friday.</P>
      <P>The proposal to hold the legislative by-election on the second Saturday of March
2009 was unanimously approved at a meeting of CEC commissioners, a CEC statement
said.</P>
      <P>According to the CEC schedule, an election gazette will be issued Jan. 5, and
hopefuls are eligible to register their candidacy from Jan. 12-16.</P>
      <P>Qualified candidates will draw lots Feb. 18 to determine the order in which
their names will appear on the ballots and can present their platforms in
officially organized campaign forums from March 4-13.</P>
      <P>CEC officials said the Miaoli County government originally suggested that the
by-election be held March 7, but with six national civil service exams taking
place that day, CEC commissioners decided to hold the by-election a week later
on March 14.</P>
      <P>Lee, of the ruling Kuomintang, was elected as a first-term lawmaker on Jan. 12
earlier this year but lost the seat Dec. 10 when the Taiwan High Court's
Taichung branch rejected his appeal against a May 28 Miaoli District Court
ruling, which had annulled his election on vote-buying charges.</P>
      <P>Lee was the first member of the current legislature to lose a seat. The loss is
not expected to have much impact on the lawmaking body, where the KMT and its
allies hold nearly three-fourths of seats.</P>
      <P>Lee, a former secretary-general of the Miaoli County Farmers' Association,
garnered 64,817 votes in the Jan. 12 election to 46,905 votes for two-term
legislator  Tu Wen-ching of the Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Tu filed a civil suit seeking the invalidation of Lee's election.</P>
      <P>The court verdict said Lee made 16 visits to temples in Yuanli and Jhunan -- two
of the eight townships in one of Miaoli's County's two electoral districts --
between June and October last year.</P>
      <P>During that time he made donations and solicited support, via his campaign
aides, for his election bid.</P>
      <P>Because Lee had not been previously known to make donations to temples and had
only done so during the election campaign, the court ruled they were designed to
improperly influence voter behavior.</P>
      <P>The high court had the final say on the case.</P>
      <P>As Lee's remaining term in office exceeded one year, the CEC must hold a by-
election in the county's first electoral district within three months from the
day it receives the relevant court verdict under the existing Public Officials
Election and Recall Law.</P>

      <P>EVA Airways, which has been commissioned to fly a pair of pandas from the
southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan to Taiwan Dec. 23, promised Friday it
will do its best to ensure a quiet and stable flight for the two rare animals.</P>
      <P>EVA Air spokesman Nieh Kuo-wei said the company has sent an advance team to
Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, to go over technical details regarding
the charter flight from Shuangliu Airport to Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport.</P>

the pandas," Nieh said, adding that the plane will not take off until the
optimal moment to ensure a stable flight for the animals.</P>
      <P>In the 180-cubic meter main cargo cabin, the temperature will be first set at 12
degrees Celsius and gradually raised to 18-20 C, the level most suitable for
pandas.</P>
      <P>During the flight, only animal caretakers, conservationists and veterinarians
will be allowed to stay with them in the cabin, Nieh said.</P>
      <P>Taipei Zoo has prepared  a penthouse-sized  outdoor garden decorated with ferns

to welcome the two pandas, named Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan.</P>
      <P>The pandas, whose names together mean "reunion," are set to reach this zoo
compound Dec.23 as a goodwill gift from China, which claims sovereignty over

up to a total installed capacity of 6.5 million kilowatts.</P>
      <P>The measure would guarantee a return on investment and strengthen the
willingness to invest in power generation using renewable energy. It would
establish mechanisms for the linking of renewable-energy generating facilities
to the power industry and for a guaranteed price for their electricity.</P>
      <P>Under the proposed law, large public construction projects in the future must
use solar energy to meet a stipulated percentage of their total energy
consumption.</P>
      <P>According to a Bureau of Energy estimate, once the Renewable Energy Development
bill becomes law, Taiwan's annual solar energy output could be increased from
2.8 million kilowatts in 2007 to 8.45 million kilowatts by 2025, accounting for
8 percent of Taiwan's total electricity generation capacity.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Musician hopes to draw attention to environment at Alishan concert</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Renowned Canadian environmental musician Matthew Lien hopes that his sunrise
concert on Alishan Jan. 1 will concentrate the attention of more local residents
on environmental issues.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Central News Agency on Friday, Lien said that with the
concert being held in an area where some precious animals and rare plants are
found, it will offer"the best way"for the audience to"think about the natural
environment and cultures that we live with in this world."</P>
      <P>Though most people are currently caught up in the global economic downturn,
Lien stressed it was even more important to focus investment and government
attention on environmental degradation, as it is "far more serious and will have
far greater impact than our economy."</P>
      <P>That way, he went on, "we could really do a lot to save, protect and revive our
ecology in the world."</P>
      <P>Lien said he finds the concert"very special"because it will take place as the
sun rises, which he felt was "much more meaningful" than most year-end
performances that begin late on New Year's Eve to usher in the new year.</P>
      <P>"The idea of opening a new year during a time when our Earth actually begins to
warm up and rolls into the sun at the first moment of light is a timeless event,
"he said, adding that this is what people have been celebrating over many
generations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chung Fu-song, head of the Alishan National Scenic Area
Administration, one of the concert's organizers, also said at a press conference
earlier in the day that Lien's music will sit well with Alishan's beautiful
ecology and"provide a spiritual feast"to the event participants.</P>
      <P>Alishan, one of Taiwan's most popular mountain resorts, will be the scene of two
concerts to ring in the new year. The first concert on Dec. 31, to be held at
the Alishan Tourist Service Center, features a band, singers and the Hamowana
Dancing Group of the indigenous Tsou Tribe.</P>
      <P>The second concert will take place in the early morning of Jan. 1 at the Jhushan
Helicopter Apron -- a favorite spot for tourists to watch the sunrise on Alishan
-- as the first gleam of sunlight of 2009 can be seen from there.</P>
      <P>The Jan. 1 concert will feature performances by Lien, who will play from 7: 20
a.m. to 8: 20 a.m. that day, as well as the Ten Drum Art Percussion Ensemble.</P>
      <P>According to the organizer, there will be an increase of train service to
coincide with the event, while those hoping to stay on the mountain the night
before are advised to book rooms in advance.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A forest fire on Hsuehshan, also known as Snow Mountain, was put out Friday
afternoon, but not before four hectares of firs and arrow bamboo trees burned to
the ground.</P>
      <P>The fire on the 3,886-meter mountain in northern Taiwan was ignited Thursday
afternoon when a six-member mountain-climbing group raised a fire to alert a
rescue helicopter of the exact location of a injured climber, who fractured a
bone in a fall near a mountain lodge.</P>
      <P>While the injured climber surnamed Wu was taken by helicopter to a hospital in
Chiayi for treatment, the fire quickly spread.</P>
      <P>Local firefighters rushed to the scene, but hampered by a lack of water and the
mountainous winding terrain, they called on the Ministry of the Interior to send
a helicopter to help combat the blaze.</P>
      <P>A helicopter loaded with 26.4 tons of water flew two missions to the mountain
and sprayed the blaze from the air. The fire came under control Friday at noon
and was fully extinguished at 4: 51 p.m., but some rangers stayed on the scene
to prevent it from reigniting.</P>
      <P>Forestry Bureau officials said they will ask for compensation for the damage
done to the forest. Shei-Pa National Park police have also questioned members of
the mountain climbing team.</P>
      <P>For the safety of visitors, Shei-Pa National Park also announced that most of
the mountain trails will be temporarily closed to hikers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Fishing gear businesses thrive as unemployed take solace in angling</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/20/08  13:57:45</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's experienced recreational fishermen have long enjoyed outings on the
island's picturesque coasts and river estuaries, able to catch plenty of fish in
peace while enjoying the great outdoors.</P>
      <P>Not any more.</P>
      <P>The global economic downturn has swollen the ranks of Taiwan's unemployed
desperate for inexpensive ways to pass their expanded leisure time, leading to
an explosion of anglers at major fishing spots around the island and a sharp
increase in sales at fishing tackle stores.</P>
      <P>The prime fishing areas on Taiwan's northern coastline are now often jammed with
anglers, leading to complaints among the old hands that they are finding it
increasingly difficult to find space to enjoy their favorite pastime.</P>
      <P>Hsiaolee,  an enthusiastic angler who has been fishing at Keelung's Badouzih
fishing port for more than 10 years, says the area has never been more
congested.</P>
      <P>"Maybe it's because of the dramatic increase in the number of unemployed," he
sighs.</P>
      <P>Hsiaolee says that in the past, whenever he received information from weather
reports or other anglers that shoals of fish were passing through, he would only
have to leave home early in the morning to get a prime spot around Badouzih.</P>
      <P>"But these days, I have to brave the early morning chill and leave home well
before dawn. Even then, I often can't find a spot at a coastal fishing site, far
less an ideal one, " he grumbles.</P>
      <P>The increase in the number of fishermen can also be seen at nearby Bisha fishing
port, located just to the east of Keelung City.</P>
      <P>A-chang, a ruddy-faced fish vendor at the port who fishes both as a hobby and
sometimes as a way to supplement his income, says the number of coastal anglers
has increased substantially in the past few months, with many of them novices.</P>
      <P>He's found a positive side, however, to the phenomenon.</P>
      <P>"In recent months, I have from time to time experienced the joy of helping some
of these novice anglers catch their first fish, " he says. "It's a feeling
second to none in the angling world."</P>
      <P>Among his new fishing buddies is Bill Ting, a middle-aged textile mechanic who
lost his job two months ago. Ting says he finds angling to be a really good way
for unemployed people to kill time and try their luck.</P>
      <P>"The experience of throwing a line from shore in the cool autumn air is
comfortable and even therapeutic," Ting smiles.</P>
      <P>A fishing greenhorn, Ting says he felt a "love and respect" for the first fish
he caught last week with the assistance of A-chang -- so much so that he
released it back into the sea.</P>
      <P>"I don't care whether I catch a fish or not. I just like the feeling of sitting
on the shore and watching the clear water shimmering under rays of sunlight in
the gentle breeze or at dusk, " he adds.</P>
      <P>Not all anglers are as lyrical as Ting, but many talk about their great joy and
sense of achievement in catching a fish, while others say they like the sense of
a shared passion and chatting with fellow anglers.</P>
      <P>Lin Chia-han, a computer hardware engineer at Taiwan's high-tech heartland, the
Hsinchu Science Park, says he has long been passionate about fishing and that
the Fongshan stream in Jhubei City near the northern Taiwan science park is one
of his favorite haunts.</P>
      <P>"In the past, the number of anglers would usually be in the single digits on
weekdays, but now they turn up in hordes and pack both sides of the river, "
says Lin, forced to take unpaid leave by his employer, a memory chip vendor.</P>
      <P>While many newcomers are on unpaid leave, others are new retirees who accepted
early retirement buyouts from employers looking to trim their payrolls.</P>
      <P>Lin says he takes comfort in their company. "Even though most of us are new
acquaintances, we have similar career backgrounds and can easily make small talk
or share our views on topics of common interest," he says.</P>
      <P>According to the latest government statistics, the unemployment rate surged to a
five-year high of 4.37 percent for October, with 35,000 laid off during the
month due to downsizing or company closures. More than 470,000 people were out
of work around the country.</P>
      <P>The growing number of anglers has helped the fishing tackle business emerge as a
rare bright spot in the generally gloomy local retail sector.</P>
      <P>While industry-wide sales figures are hard to come by, anecdotal evidence
indicates revenues have grown considerably at fishing gear outlets around the
country.</P>
      <P>Chiu Ching-tung, the owner of a fishing tackle shop in the northeastern coastal
town of Suao in Yilan County, says the area has seen a noticeable rise in the
number of anglers in the area, though partly because winter is the peak fishing
season.</P>
      <P>"While old customers remain the mainstay of my clientele, there have also been
many fresh faces, " says Chiu, who estimated that his turnover has grown 20
percent to 30 percent in the past couple of months alone.</P>
      <P>At the other end of the country, meanwhile, Lin Ming-hua, the proprietor of a
tackle shop in the southern port city of Kaohsiung, echoes Chiu's estimates,
also saying that his business has risen by around 30 percent in recent months.</P>
      <P>"In addition to old patrons, I am also serving many newcomers, including those
from neighboring cities and counties or even from central and northern Taiwan,"
Lin says.</P>
      <P>First-timers, he observes, tend to purchase cheap fishing rods costing only a
few hundred new Taiwan dollars, but often spend a lot on bait and flavored bait
enhancers.</P>
      <P>Lin, himself an avid angler, says that nearly all riverbanks and harbor estuary
embankments in the city are now all packed with anglers even on weekdays.</P>
      <P>"This is a phenomenon I have never seen before," he adds.</P>
      <P>Even Taiwan's political figures have taken solace in fishing.</P>
      <P>Hualien County Magistrate Hsieh Shen-san, a self-admitted avid fisherman, went
fishing in his rural home in the eastern county to heal his wounds after losing
a tight battle for Taipei County magistrate in 1997.</P>
      <P>"Fishing is good exercise that can help cultivate the essential qualities of
mental well-being such as concentration and serenity, " Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>His political career regained momentum by winning the Hualien County magistrate
by-election in August 2003 and re-election in 2005, but there has been a
downside to this professional resurgence.</P>
      <P>"Nowadays, I don't have any time to go fishing," he laments.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ship repair demand expected to jump on opening of shipping links</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's leading shipbuilder CSBC Corp. unveiled a plan Saturday to expand its
ship repair services to meet a possible rise in repair demand following the
recent opening of direct shipping links with China.</P>
      <P>CSBC Corp. Chairman Cheng Wen-lon noted that revenue from ship repairs currently
contribute to 5 percent of the company's total revenues, but the segment is
expected to get a significant boost thanks to the launch of direct cross-Taiwan
Strait shipping.</P>
      <P>In particular, the lack of any large shipbuilding or ship repair facilities
along the Chinese coast between Shanghai and Guangzhou means the business would
be even more lucrative, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Targeting this new business opportunity, the company is planning to set up
floating docks in coastal areas to strengthen its ship repair capacity, he said.</P>
      <P>This year, the company, which completed its privatization Dec. 18, is expected
to post profits amounting to NT$6 billion, before deductions for the retirement
pension reserve fund. Its profits will be the highest recorded in the 35 years
since the company was established, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The company is holding shipbuilding orders amounting to a total of NT$120
billion, which will keep its production lines busy for the next three and a half
years, he said.</P>
      <P>He said that in the future, the privatized CSBC Corp. will work to enhance its
international competitiveness, upgrade its production efficiency and strengthen
cost control to further improve its performance.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, CSBC Vice President Wang Ko-hsuan noted that the global shipbuilding
industry has suffered becuase of the worldwide recession, with orders for more
than 240 bulk carriers and 27 container vessels having been canceled around the
world.</P>
      <P>However, the CSBS has not faced such problems because its main clients are all
top reputable ship owners, such as Taiwan-based Yang Ming Marine Transport Corp.
and Wan Hai Lines and Japan-based Marubeni Corp, Wang said.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou appealed to elementary school children and their parents
Saturday to make full use of the shopping vouchers they will receive from the

      <P>Speaking at a celebration hosted by the Affiliated Experimental Elementary
School of Taiwan Municipal University of Education (TMUE) in Taipei, Ma appealed
to the gathering to help his administration in its efforts to boost the
country's flagging economy.</P>
      <P>Harking back to his days as a pupil at the elementary school and his
participation in student council elections, Ma said that was when he learned
that the "government must listen to the people so as to have their support."</P>
      <P>The president, who walked to the venue from his home, was welcomed on arrival by
students performing a lion dance.</P>
      <P>"I recall that my elementary school days were the happiest times in my life, "
Ma told them, adding that it was there he learned to interact with others.</P>
      <P>He wrote the characters "Love at elementary school, " in Chinese calligraphy in

each Taiwan citizen on Jan. 18 next year, the president said, "please, all
school children and parents, make full use of the coupons to help Taiwan's

      <P>The central government has allocated NT$85.7 billion (US$2.6 billion) to fund

      <P>The legendary Sadaharu Oh, the Japanese home-run king of baseball, on Saturday
canceled his plans to visit Taiwan, due to the death of his older brother.</P>
      <P>Oh was scheduled to arrive in Taiwan Saturday evening, but called off the trip

      <P>The Taiwan carrier Mandarin Airlines embarked on its first direct flight from
Kaohsiung to Shanghai Saturday morning with 310 passengers, including Taiwanese
business people, on board.</P>
      <P>The newly established air route, which was launched as result of an agreement
between Taiwan and China on direct links, cuts travel time between the two
cities by almost half.</P>
      <P>The Mandarin Airlines flight on the new route from Kaohsiung International
Airport to Shanghai Pudong Airport takes two hours, departing at 7: 30 a.m.,
while the return leg takes two hours and 10 minutes, departing Shanghai at 10:
50 a.m.</P>
      <P>A Taiwanese businesswoman surnamed Lin, who was taking the maiden flight on the
route with three of her family members, said it will be very convenient for her
as she operates a business in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>"I wish these direct links between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait were in
place a long time ago, " she said. "This will shorten my travel time
considerably."</P>
      <P>Another passenger surnamed Chang said that although he spends most of his time
in Shanghai, he needs to return to Taiwan at least once every two months as he
is in the real estate business. The new route would cut his total travel time by
almost half, he said, explaining that it usually takes him five to six hours to
get from his office in Shanghai to his home in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>"I am so glad these direct links between Taiwan and mainland China are available
now," said Chang. "I hope all the airlines will increase their number of direct
cross-strait flights, once the government regulations permit them to do so."</P>
      <P>A total of 17 tour groups were also on the Mandarin Airlines flight, which was
doused by celebratory jets of water on the tarmac just before take-off.</P>
      <P>Daily cross-strait charter flights between Taiwan and China were launched Dec.
15 on the basis of a set of accords signed between the two sides in early
November, which also paved the way for the establishment of direct postal and
shipping links.</P>
      <P>On the first day of the direct daily flights, three Taiwanese carriers on the
routes filled 3,753 of the 4,899 seats available from Taiwan to four Chinese
destinations, while six Chinese carriers flew 1,829 passengers, or 67 percent of
the total 2,722-seat capacity, from China to Taiwan, according to Civil
Aeronautics Administration statistics.</P>
      <P>Other Taiwanese airlines, such as China Airlines, EVA Airways and TransAsia
Airways, are operating 16 two-way daily charter flights from Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport and Taipei Songshan Airport to Shanghai, Hangzhou,
Shenzhen and Guangzhou in China.</P>

      <P>Civic groups in Taiwan urged Beijing authorities Saturday to release Liu Xiaobo,
a prominent Chinese dissident writer and human rights activist who has been in
police custody since Dec. 8, and to cease harassment of other Chinese
signatories to a charter drafted by Liu to appeal for greater freedoms in China.</P>
      <P>The groups voiced the demands at a press conference, calling on China to respect
freedom of speech and embrace the terms of Liu's "Charter '08", which they said
"will be beneficial to China's democratic development and the welfare of its
citizens."</P>
      <P>They also urged President Ma Ying-jeou and opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen to openly support Chinese dissidents,
bringing to bear Taiwan's stature as a beacon of human rights and civic freedoms
in East Asia.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan cannot focus just on economic and animal exchanges with China and ignore
its role in promoting human rights, democracy and freedom in China, " said CEO
of Deng Liberty Foundation Yang Chang-chen.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai Chi-hsun, secretary-general of the Taiwan Association For
Human Rights, since the civic groups learned of Liu's detention they have set up
a Web site where people can go to sign online petitions.</P>
      <P>Charter 08, crafted by Liu and endorsed by over 300 prominent Chinese citizens,
was conceived in the spirit of Charter 77, which was signed by more than 200
Czech and Slovak intellectuals from 1977 to 1992 to push for human and civil
rights in what was then Czechoslovakia.</P>
      <P>Liu, along with another Chinese scholar Zhang Zuhua, was taken away by Chinese
police Dec. 8, two days before the 60th anniversary of the United Nations'
adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Charter 08 was announced
on Dec. 10.</P>
      <P>According to Zhang, who was later released, he and Liu were detained on
suspicion of gathering signatures for the charter, which appealed for reforms
and greater respect for human rights in China.</P>
      <P>The United States government issued a statement Dec.  11, expressing concern
over the reports of Liu's detention and calling on the Chinese government to
release him.</P>

      <P>The government will make sure Taiwan's dignity and sovereign status are not
undermined when it lifts its restrictions on visits to China by senior officials
and military personnel, Minister of the Interior Liao Liou-yi said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Liao said he believes the liberalization policy will meet the public's
expectations and that a related plan has been presented to the Cabinet for
review.</P>
      <P>The minister, however, declined to elaborate on the details of the plan.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan first indicated on Friday that the Cabinet  is working
toward  the goal of lifting  the travel restrictions, which apply to civil
servants at grade 11 or higher, political appointees, top executives of state-
owned enterprises and military personnel.</P>
      <P>According to officials at the Ministry of the Interior, the liberalization plan
would allow all civil servants at grade 11 or higher to travel to China for the
purposes of sightseeing and visiting relatives.</P>
      <P>While political appointees are currently only allowed to visit China for
international conferences or activities, the restriction would be relaxed to
allow them to take part in activities related to their work, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Military personnel, security personnel, officials posted overseas and personnel
engaging in the research and development of secret technologies, would be
allowed to visit China on official business, to visit sick relatives or to
attend the funeral of close relatives, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, they added, the MOI is also planning to ease the restrictions on
visits to Taiwan by Chinese officials.</P>
      <P>Chinese officials are currently permitted to visit Taiwan only in a private
capacity and if they are invited by a school or civil organization in Taiwan.
However, in the future they would be allowed to come to Taiwan in an official
capacity at the invitation of the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation, the
MOI officials said.</P>

were caused by the low-pathogenic H5N2 bird flu virus.</P>
      <P>The COA reiterated, however, that the H5N2 virus is, so far, not known to jump
to humans.</P>
      <P>COA Minister Chen Wu-hsiung told a news conference that his agency has been
undertaking disinfection measures and monitoring wild and migratory birds.</P>
      <P>The COA said it is still investigating the source of the infection.</P>

      <P>Taiwan should do more to reduce accidental deaths among children, as the number
of local children who die in accidents remains high, Vice President Vincent Siew
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at an award ceremony for a painting contest that featured themes of
promoting children's safety, Siew said that up to 450 local children under age
14 died in accidents last year.</P>
      <P>"The figure translated into more than one accidental death per day among local
children, " Siew lamented, adding that the ratio was too high to be overlooked.</P>
      <P>With an ever-declining birth rate, Siew said, Taiwan's population is aging. "And
children are not only the pillar of the country but also the source of family
happiness," Siew said.</P>
      <P>There is still ample room for the government and the private sector to work
together to provide a safer living environment for children, he added.</P>
      <P>For its part, Siew said, the government should formulate a sound policy and
detailed measures to protect children's safety. In the process, he said, civic
groups should also come together to promote the cause of ensuring children's
safety.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan needs competitive edge to benefit fully from links: experts</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 20 (CNA)
12/20/08  21:14:43
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While most Taiwan businesses appear to be pleased with the opening of direct
transport, trade and postal links between Taiwan and China, some people are
urging that if Taiwan wants to take full advantage of the links, it should move
swiftly to sharpen its competitiveness and improve its investment environment.</P>
      <P>The head of a Taiwanese businessmen association in Beijing, Lin Ching-fa,
described the "major three links" between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait as
a "good thing."</P>
      <P>However, Lin said, the Taiwan economy will not benefit from the opening unless
the country has a sound plan to maximize the effects of the direct links and
integrates its resources to more effectively reach international markets.</P>
      <P>For example, Lin said, the harbors he has visited in mainland China are mostly
capable of accommodating big cruise ships. By comparison, Taiwan's harbors,
including the largest Kaohsiung Harbor in southern Taiwan, will have to be
expanded if they are to host bigger ships and if Taiwan is to serve as a major
transshipment hub in the region, he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's seaports should be transformed into tariff-free harbors so that they
can keep pace with the changes in cross-strait relations and attract the
expected increase in business opportunities, Lin suggested.</P>
      <P>To Taiwanese businessmen, the expanded direct links represent channels for
"inflows of persons, goods and money," Lin added, urging the government to help
local enterprises to acquire a competitive edge in the new cross-strait
environment as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Chang Wu-yueh, dean of the Graduate Institute of China Studies at the Taipei-
based Tamkang University,  said Taiwan's ability to maximize the advantages of
the new marine and air transport links is dependent on its competitive edge, its
support for the global development projects of local enterprises, and its
efficiency in forging  links with the international  market through the new
cross-strait economic openings.</P>
      <P>Expanded  direct cross-strait  charter flight services were launched Dec. 15,
with carriers from both sides providing passenger service every day of the week
instead of on weekends only. The number of flights have been increased from 36
to 108 per week and the carriers are now permitted to fly directly to
destinations in northern China without having to detour through Hong Kong air
space.</P>
      <P>Also,  with the opening of direct shipping links, vessels operating on cross-
strait shipping routes are allowed to sail across the Taiwan Strait without
having to detour to Japan's Ishigaki port. The number of ports in Taiwan and
China open to cross-strait shipping services has also been increased to 74.</P>
      <P>In his analysis of the benefits of the expanded direct transport links, Chang
said that politically they have established a foundation for peace in the
strait.</P>
      <P>In terms of the economy,  the links will boost bilateral cross-strait trade,
which has reached US$130.2 billion a year, he said. In the short term, the links
will be beneficial to airline and shipping companies, traders, fruit shippers
and passengers traveling between the two sides, he added.</P>
      <P>In the long term, other industries, such as those in the tourism sector, will
profit as a result of the direct air links, especially if more Chinese tourists
come to Taiwan for sightseeing as a result, Chang forecast.</P>
      <P>Chang said that in general Taiwan's ability to take full advantage of the links
is dependent of whether or not it can effect fast and convenient passenger and
cargo service between the two sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>He further forecast that positive interaction between the two sides will attract
investments to Taiwan from around the globe.</P>
      <P>However, he warned, wider opening for personnel exchanges could lead to a flight
of Taiwanese talent to mainland China if Taiwan does not improve and upgrade its
investment and industrial environment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Avian flu virus caused chicken deaths in southern Taiwan: COA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 20 (CNA)
12/20/08  21:43:59
(By Emmanuelle Tzeng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) confirmed Saturday that the recent chicken
deaths on a poultry farm in southern Taiwan were caused by the low-pathogenic
H5N2 bird flu virus, but stressed that the virus is not the same as the high-
pathogenic H5N1 strain in China.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level COA reiterated that the H5N2 virus is so far not known to be
communicable to humans and gave the assurance that domestic poultry products are
still safe for consumption.</P>
      <P>COA Minister Chen Wu-hsiung told a press conference that his agency will step up
its monitoring of wild and migratory birds and will continue for at least three
months its disinfection of 76 poultry farms within a radius of three kilometers
of the farm in Luchu township in Kaohsiung County where 400 chickens were found
dead in late October.</P>
      <P>Local authorities  have also been instructed to strengthen epidemic prevention
and control measures, the COA said.</P>
      <P>The source  of the avian  flu infection  is still  being investigated, according
to Sung Hwa-tsung, director general of the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health
Inspection and Quarantine under the COA.</P>
      <P>Earlier this week, Japan suspended imports of poultry from Taiwan although it
had not yet been confirmed that the chickens had died from the H5N2 avian flu
virus. According to COA statistics, poultry meat and egg exports from Taiwan to
Japan are valued at around US$28 million per year.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the government will provide a series of special subsidies to help
industries that may suffer as a result of the avian flu outbreak.</P>
      <P>The subsidies will include raising the maximum value of loans to farmers from
NT$20 million to NT$30 million and those to related agricultural industries from
NT$30 million to NT$40 million, and lowering the annual interest rate on such
loans to 1.5 percent, he added.</P>
      <P>The COA said it will also activate a mechanism to stabilize the price of poultry
meat, if there is a price drop.</P>
      <P>Addressing concerns about the COA's delay in publicizing the results of its
findings, Lee Shu-hwae, deputy director general of the Animal Health Research
Institute under the COA, said that under standard operating procedure, it
requires 19 to 40 days to obtain the most precise and accurate test results.</P>

      <P>China should open its infrastructure construction  projects to Taiwanese bidders
as part of mutual cooperation  efforts to cope with the current global economic
recession,  the head of Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang (KMT) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung made the appeal at the opening session of the fourth
Cross-Strait Economic, Trade and Cultural Forum, co-organized by the KMT and the
Communist Party of China (CPC).</P>
      <P>Wu said he looks forward to China's opening of its immense public infrastructure
construction market to Taiwanese bidders.</P>
      <P>In the next two years, China will pump 4 trillion yuan (about US$586 billion)
into its economy to help spur domestic demand and sustain overall growth amid
the lingering global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>"Hopefully, Taiwanese bidders will be given access to China's public works
construction projects," Wu said, adding that Taiwan will also be willing to open
its market to Chinese contractors.</P>
      <P>By so doing, Wu said, the two sides will be able to mutually invest and learn
from each other's experience in project management and the development of new
engineering technologies.</P>
      <P>Wu further expressed hopes that the two sides will explore a feasible mode for
mutual cooperation in the financial field, and in particular devise measures to
help a large number of Taiwan-owned businesses in China obtain working capital
or bank loans to keep their companies afloat in the midst of the current
worldwide economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Promotional efforts should also be intensified to galvanize more Chinese
citizens into making pleasure trips to Taiwan now that direct cross-strait
charter flights have been expanded to a daily service from the weekends-only
formula, Wu added.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, KMT honorary Chairman Lien Chan said the two
sides should forge a viable mechanism for normalizing their trade and economic
relations, since China has become Taiwan's most important trade partner and
largest export market.</P>
      <P>"It's strategically significant for our two sides to thrash out a comprehensive
mechanism for normal trade and economic exchanges and cooperation across the
Taiwan Strait," Lien explained, adding that he hopes the ongoing two-day KMT-CPC
forum can come up with concrete proposals in this regard.</P>
      <P>Five Taiwan government officials, including Shan Chi, vice chairman of the
Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development, are attending the
party-to-party forum in a private capacity.</P>
      <P>Shan delivered a speech on Taiwan's general economic situation and prospects for
cross-strait economic cooperation, making him the first senior Taiwan government
official ever to speak in the KMT-CPC forum.</P>
      <P>In his address, Shan suggested that the two sides explore the feasibility of

      <P>Certain restrictions or conditions will remain in place when the current
regulations are revised to make it easier for senior officials and military
personnel to visit China, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Liu was responding to criticism that the planned lifting of restrictions on
visits to China by senior officials and servicemen could put national security
at risk.</P>
      <P>Opposition  Taiwan Solidarity Union Chairman Huang Kun-huei suggested earlier in
the day that civil servants in charge of tasks related with classified
intelligence should not be allowed to visit China.</P>
      <P>In response, Liu said relevant government agencies are still working on a legal
amendment package which, while paving the way for senior civil servants,
political appointees, top executives of state-owned enterprises and military
personnel to visit China for business purposes or pleasure trips, will retain
certain restrictions on such travel.</P>
      <P>The premier first indicated Friday that the Cabinet is working toward the goal
of lifting the travel restrictions, which apply to civil servants at grade 11 or
higher, political appointees, top executives of state-owned enterprises and
military personnel.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Liao Liou-yi said Saturday that the government will make sure
Taiwan's dignity and sovereign status are not undermined when it lifts its
restrictions on visits to China by senior officials and military personnel.</P>

      <P>China should open its infrastructure construction  projects to Taiwanese bidders
as part of mutual cooperation  efforts to cope with the current global economic
recession,  the head of Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang (KMT) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung made the appeal at the opening session of the fourth
Cross-Strait Economic, Trade and Cultural Forum, co-organized by the KMT and the
Communist Party of China (CPC).</P>
      <P>Wu said he looks forward to China's opening of its immense public infrastructure
construction market to Taiwanese bidders.</P>
      <P>In the next two years, China will pump 4 trillion yuan (about US$586 billion)
into its economy to help spur domestic demand and sustain overall growth amid
the lingering global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>"Hopefully, Taiwanese bidders will be given access to China's public works
construction projects," Wu said, adding that Taiwan will also be willing to open
its market to Chinese contractors.</P>
      <P>By so doing, Wu said, the two sides will be able to mutually invest and learn
from each other's experience in project management and the development of new
engineering technologies.</P>
      <P>Wu further expressed hopes that the two sides will explore a feasible mode for
mutual cooperation in the financial field, and in particular devise measures to
help a large number of Taiwan-owned businesses in China obtain working capital
or bank loans to keep their companies afloat in the midst of the current
worldwide economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Promotional efforts should also be intensified to galvanize more Chinese
citizens into making pleasure trips to Taiwan now that direct cross-strait
charter flights have been expanded to a daily service from the weekends-only
formula, Wu added.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, KMT honorary Chairman Lien Chan said the two
sides should forge a viable mechanism for normalizing their trade and economic
relations, since China has become Taiwan's most important trade partner and
largest export market.</P>
      <P>"It's strategically significant for our two sides to thrash out a comprehensive
mechanism for normal trade and economic exchanges and cooperation across the
Taiwan Strait," Lien explained, adding that he hopes the ongoing two-day KMT-CPC
forum can come up with concrete proposals in this regard.</P>
      <P>Five Taiwan government officials, including Shan Chi, vice chairman of the
Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development, are attending the
party-to-party forum in a private capacity.</P>
      <P>Shan delivered a speech on Taiwan's general economic situation and prospects for
cross-strait economic cooperation, making him the first senior Taiwan government
official ever to speak in the KMT-CPC forum.</P>
      <P>In his address, Shan suggested that the two sides explore the feasibility of
taking part in each other's economic stimulus projects to accelerate recovery of
their economies.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday that in light of the rising unemployment in
Taiwan, it would be difficult at this time for the government to increase the
foreign labor force.</P>
      <P>"The society will not forgive" the government for such a move, Ma said in
response to a request from local enterprises to allow the import of larger
numbers of foreign workers.</P>
      <P>In a meeting between the president and more than 100 company owners and
representatives at the Taiwan Industrial Park in the northern county of Taoyuan,
some businessmen complained that local workers appear reluctant to take certain
types of jobs and they asked Ma to consider allowing the recruitment of larger
numbers of foreign labor.</P>
      <P>In response, Ma said that he knows local companies are facing tough challenges
in maintaining their business in the current economic environment which is being
impacted by the global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>However, the president said, he has instructed the Council of Labor Affairs
(CLA) to contact those companies that have asked for a larger foreign work force
and to try to supply them with local workers.</P>
      <P>The CLA announced a few days ago, amid calls for the government to help local
people gain employment, that it will conduct an overall review to Taiwan's
foreign laborer policy to safeguard job opportunities for Taiwanese.</P>

      <P>CNA staff writer</P>
      <P>Spanish tenor Jose Carreras thrilled a packed audience of over 50,000 at the
Miaoli County Stadium on a warm November evening this year, in the kind of show
that is rarely seen in the predominantly agricultural county in north-central
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In an innovative show of generosity, the Miaoli county government gave out
40,000 free tickets for the show, but more than 50,000 people showed up on the
night.</P>
      <P>Although the organizers opened the side gate of the stadium to let in some of
the disappointed hopefuls half an hour after the concert began, there were still
some 10,000 people left sitting on a riverbank near the stadium who had to make
do with listening to a live broadcast of the internationally renowned maestro's
performance.</P>
      <P>Despite causing traffic jams in the normally serene hilly city, the
unprecedented concert raised the self-esteem of Miaoli folks, who felt
privileged and respected by the county government as a result of the concert.</P>
      <P>The county government spent NT$20 million (US$597,000) to line up the concert --
a move initiated by Magistrate Liu Cheng-hung, who once said that it makes his
heart ache to see Miaoli County, long considered a "cultural desert, " left out
each time a major cultural event has taken place in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The rare concert, open to all, also helped attract many visitors from further
afield than Miaoli who spent money in the county, which Liu had anticipated.</P>
      <P>Liu, a six-term Kuomintang legislator, in 2005 became the first non-Hakka
magistrate in the history of Miaoli County -- a major Hakka area in Taiwan with
a Hakka population of 70 percent.</P>
      <P>"Hakka" literally means "guest people." Roughly 27 percent of Taiwan's
population  consider themselves  descendants  of Hakka ancestors, believed to
have emigrated from the Yellow River area some 1,000 years ago to southern China
to escape war and famine and who thereafter  moved to Taiwan and represent a
sizeable diaspora elsewhere in the world.</P>
      <P>The happy times didn't stop with Carreras. Miaoli residents were entertained
Dec. 3-5 by another globally famous group -- the Irish River Dance -- with
tickets available to the locals at giveaway prices, also partially financed by
the county government.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, when the motion picture 1895, a Hakka-language epic portraying one of
the biggest battles in the history of Taiwan, was released in early November,
Liu's office treated Miaoli residents to free screenings.</P>
      <P>Not a dry eye in the house as the movie, based on a novel by one of Taiwan's
best-known Hakka writers, Li Chiao, brings to life Hakka militia resistance to
Japanese troops after Qing Dynasty China was defeated in the First Sino-Japanese
War (1894-95) and ceded Taiwan to Tokyo under the Treaty of Shimonoseki.</P>
      <P>During those days of cultural entertainment, reservations for rooms in hotels,
hostels and guest houses scattered around Miaoli County were all booked, shops
and restaurants were packed, and business operators were smiling from ear to ear
at their good fortune.</P>
      <P>The treats were actually feedback to the Miaoli folks, paid for out of prize
money that Liu and his administration won from the central government in an
investment inducement competition.</P>
      <P>Miaoli County won first prize -- a handsome NT$100 million -- in the Level B
investment inducement competition for successfully inducing several
manufacturing companies to relocate some of their investments to Miaoli,
traditionally an agricultural area and a relative backwater in terms of business
and industry.</P>
      <P>Liu personally gave briefings during the competition on how the county succeeded
in persuading  leading  hi-tech manufacturing companies, including the Hon Hai
Group -- the world's largest contract  maker of consumer  electronics  by
revenue --  into establishing factories in Miaoli to take advantage of the
area's inexpensive land, labor force and all relevant costs, an endeavor Liu
said has in turn infused new life and energy into the county's economy.</P>
      <P>In order to rev up the county's slumping economy, Liu has pulled out all the
stops, including moves to take full advantage when the Executive Yuan
distributes free shopping vouchers nationwide in January to spur spending and
bolster economic growth.</P>
      <P>Liu, the shrewd and industrious son of a farmer who became head of farmers'
associations in the Miaoli area at a very young age before climbing the
political ladder to become a legislator and then magistrate, has decided to
invest NT$10 million to generate business on the back of the shopping vouchers.</P>
      <P>His office announced recently that every person who spends NT$5,000 in the
county, including the NT$3,600 shopping vouchers that each Taiwan citizen will
receive from Jan. 18, will be entered in a lucky draw, with prizes including 10
luxury cars, 100 TFT-LED televisions,  refrigerators  and many other hi-tech
health and entertainment gear.</P>
      <P>Liu reckons that if all 560,000 Miaoli residents spend their shopping vouchers
in the county, business worth over NT$2.8 billion will be generated in a span of
nine months, which in turn will create over NT$70 million in tax revenues for
the county coffers. The vouchers will remain valid from Jan. 18 until Sept. 30
next year.</P>
      <P>Liu, who has been learning the Hakka dialect since being elected magistrate and
who has even sat Cabinet-sponsored Hakka language tests in order to bridge the
conversation gap with his constituents, is not all business, however.</P>
      <P>With the remaining funds that his administration won in the investment
inducement competition, he was instrumental in helping care for youths from
destitute families or those who were marked for special discipline because of
behavioral problems.</P>
      <P>After finding out from social workers that many young people in the county have
never gone on a leisure outing with their parents because of poverty or other
reasons, Liu decided to give each such youth -- around 3,300 -- NT$1,500 so that
they could go out with their parents or guardians to spend some "quality time,"
even just once.</P>
      <P>Liu, who has never ceased striving over the past three years to improve the
county's development,  told CNA that his greatest aspiration is to turn Miaoli
into a city suitable for investment, good for living and attractive for tourists
by the time he finishes his two four-year stints in 2013.</P>
      <P>He echoed the motto that his predecessor, Hsieh Chin-ting, passed on to him when
he was sworn in three years ago that as a magistrate, he will "leave morality to
the offspring, development to the county and only my name to myself."</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF pushes for increased number of cross-strait charter flights</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's intermediary Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)  has been working to
secure an agreement on increasing the number of direct cross-Taiwan Strait
charter flights to 168 per week during the upcoming Lunar New Year holidays from
the current 108, according an SEF official.</P>
      <P>SEF Vice Chairman Kao Koong-lian  was quoted by the Hong Kong-based daily Wen
Wei Po as saying Saturday that the SEF is currently negotiating with the
relevant Chinese authorities to increase the number of charters over the Chinese
New Year to accommodate the many Taiwanese businesspeople and their dependents
who usually return to Taiwan at that time.</P>
      <P>Kao was quoted as telling the 20-odd heads of Taiwanese business associations
around China during a meeting in the southern Chinese city of Xiamen that "there
might be good news in this regard before the 2009 Chinese New Year's Day," which
falls on Jan. 26.</P>
      <P>Kao, who doubles as secretary-general of the quasi-official SEF, made the
remarks after a Wuhan-based Taiwanese businessman Yu Ming-chin stated at the
meeting that the current 108 cross-strait flights per week can only accommodate
around 1.5 million Taiwanese travelers a year.</P>
      <P>"That is inadequate by far to meet actual demand, as Taiwanese make roughly 6
million visits to and from China each year, " said Yu, who is a vice chairman of
the Association of Taiwanese Invested Enterprises on the Mainland.</P>
      <P>"About 70 percent of the Taiwanese who frequently visit China will not be able
to enjoy the convenience of traveling via the existing cross-strait charter
flights," Yu claimed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to the Wen Wei Po report, Kao said that following his own
visits to China to listen to the needs and problems of Taiwanese businesspeople
there, SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung will also meet with Taiwanese business
leaders in Guangdong Province and Jiangsu Province from Jan. 7-11.</P>
      <P>Issues expected to be discussed during the meetings between Chiang and the
Taiwanese business leaders include fund constraints, ways of extending loans to
Taiwanese businesses, and the problems they have been facing as result of higher
taxes and overhead costs since China's implementation of new labor contract and
land use laws.</P>
      <P>According to Kao, Chiang and the SEF officials will also discuss the reduction
of customs tariffs with their Chinese counterparts, a move that may eventually
lead to developing the two sides of the Taiwan Strait as free trade zones, the
Wen Wei Po reported.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) on Sunday encouraged people facing sudden
financial difficulties and other problems due to the current economic recession
to phone the "1957 national welfare hotline" for help.</P>
      <P>The central government, in collaboration with local governments, set up the
hotline in November 2006 to provide timely help to people with dire problems.
The service offers on-site visits, emergency relief, employment assistance and
legal counseling.</P>
      <P>So far this year, an average of 1,000-1,990 calls per month were made to the
hotline, with most callers seeking emergency relief, unemployment support, and
medical treatment aid, according to the ministry.</P>
      <P>Many people have successfully overcome their difficulties with the help of the
service provided via the hotline, the MOI said.</P>
      <P>The ministry cited the example of a man surnamed Hsiung in Taoyuan County, who
was granted urgent financial subsidies at first and later landed a job with the
help of the local government's employment center after he made a call earlier in
the year to the hotline seeking assistance.</P>
      <P>At the time, Hsiung had suffered a number of blows in quick succession and was
reeling from the death of his wife, the loss of his job and his financial
inability to look after his young child, according to the MOI.</P>
      <P>Usually, there is a spike in the number of calls just before the Chinese New
Year, the MOI said, noting that 1,991 calls were recorded in January, the
highest number for the year so far.</P>
      <P>The ministry anticipates that more and more people will be seeking urgent help,
in light of the increasing number of businesses that are failing and the rising
unemployment in the country due to the economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it said, it is urging people with problems to call the hotline to
obtain help.</P>

      <P>The second round of applications for a government-sponsored housing subsidy that
will help cover rental and interest payments has now been opened, the
Construction and Planning Agency announced Sunday, urging eligible families to
apply at their local household registry office.</P>
      <P>Under the program, the government will offer a subsidy of up to NT$3,000 per
month for one year to eligible families to help them cover their rent, the
agency under the Ministry of the Interior said.</P>
      <P>The government will also subsidize the interest payments by new home buyers on
loans of up to NT$2.2 million with a 20-year repayment period. Borrowers of
house repair loans of up to NT$800,000 with an 15-year repayment period are also
elegible to apply for subsidies to help pay the interest, according to the
agency.</P>
      <P>Applications for the rental subsidy will expire Dec. 31 this year, while
applications for government-subsidized home loans will expire Feb. 25, 2009, the
agency said.</P>
      <P>The agency first announced the program earlier in the year, calling for
applications, which closed on Aug. 15.</P>
      <P>In the second application phase, there are 8,000 openings for rental subsidies,
25,445 for home loan subsidies, and 3,720 for home improvement loan subsidies,
according to the agency.</P>
      <P>Under the program, the preferential interest rate on loans to eligible
households is 1.617 percent, and on those to disadvantaged families 1.042
percent. The country's central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate by
three-quarters of a percentage point earlier in the month, the agency noted.</P>
      <P>This home purchase  loan scheme  will be administered  in conjunction with
another preferential home loan program launched on Sept. 22, under which the
government will allocate an additional NT$200 billion until Sept. 21, 2010 to
grant each qualified household in Taipei City a maximum loan of NT$3.5 million
at a preferential interest rate, the agency added.</P>
      <P>For eligible households outside Taipei City, the maximum figure for such loans
is NT$3 million.</P>
      <P>Families with an annual combined income of less than NT$970,000 and who do not
own a home can apply for a home purchase loan or a housing rental subsidy, while
those who own a house that is more than 10 years old can apply for a house
improvement loan, according to the agency.</P>

      <P>China's top official in charge of Taiwan affairs announced 10 measures Sunday to
boost business and trade exchanges with Taiwan and increase financial assistance
to Taiwanese businesspeople operating on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Wang Yi, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council,  said
Chinese  banking institutions,  including  China Development Bank, Bank of China
and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, will be authorized to increase
their loans and credit services, to a maximum of 130 billion Chinese yuan
(US$18.99 billion), to China-based Taiwanese enterprises over the next three
years to help them tide over the difficulties they face in the global economic
downturn.</P>
      <P>Wang made the announcement at the fourth joint Cross-Strait Economic, Trade and
Cultural Forum held by Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang and the Communist Party of
China (CPC). The forum opened in Shanghai Saturday and closed Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the Chinese authorities will help China-based Taiwanese
enterprises to upgrade or restructure so as to sharpen their competitiveness.</P>
      <P>China will push for increased bilateral investment across the Taiwan Strait and
will help boost cooperation among industrial manufacturing sectors on both sides
to make them more competitive in the international market, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese TFT-LED TV manufacturers will increase purchases of display
panels from Taiwanese makers, with the shopping list to total US$2 billion in
the initial stage, Wang said.</P>
      <P>China will also expand agricultural cooperation with Taiwan, Wang said, adding
that three Chinese provinces -- Jiangsu, Guangdong and Yunnan -- will make
tracts of land available exclusively for Taiwanese farmers to develop farms in
China.</P>
      <P>China and Taiwan should expedite  negotiations  on affairs pertaining to customs
clearance and quarantine procedures so as to speed up Taiwan's sale of seafood
and other fresh grocery products to Chinese markets, Wang suggested.</P>
      <P>China will also allow Taiwanese lawyers to practice in China once they comply
with certain conditions set by the Chinese government, he added.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung and KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan led a party

      <P>Smoking is also banned, under the law, in outdoor public areas, including train
station platforms, gymnasiums,  swimming pools, college campuses, and
entertainment areas.</P>
      <P>Violators will risk fines of between NT$2,000 and NT$10,000 (US$605).</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Secretary-General Lin Hsi-shan pointed out that under the new
law the legislature is not permitted to designate a smoking area within the
building and that legislators who wish to smoke will have to do so outside the
building.</P>
      <P>Lee Hung-chun, a legislator of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) who has been a smoker
since he was a student more than 30 years ago, said it may be time now for him
to quit the habit because of the inconvenience of finding a place to smoke.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Tsai Chin-lung, who has already kicked his 30-year habit,
encouraged his colleagues to follow his example and quit smoking.</P>
      <P>"If they really cannot kick the habit, they must be more observant of the new
law than the ordinary public," he said.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Shuai Hua-ming said he will respect other people's right to
refuse to inhale second-hand smoke, and that when he feels like smoking, he will
go outside the building.</P>
      <P>Legislator Ker Chien-ming, the chain-smoking legislative caucus convener of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , said he still has reservations
about whether it might be difficult to comply with the law, but added that he
will do his best.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Pan Meng-an said jokingly that he will probably go into
depression because of the new law, but he added, "I am afraid that I may have to
quit smoking."</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Tien Chiu-chin, who has campaigned hard against smoking, said
that smoking has become such a serious public hazard that it is necessary to
maintain a smoke-free work environment.</P>
      <P>She quoted an estimate by the Cabinet-level Department of Health which shows
that smoking-induced diseases have cost the Bureau of National Insurance an
extra NT$30 billion (US$922.58 million) a year in terms of medical expenses.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cross-strait trade cooperation not yet on agenda: SEF chair</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said Sunday that economic
and trade cooperation agreements will not be part of his third meeting with
President of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS)
Chen Yunlin.</P>
      <P>"However, although economic and trade cooperation will not be discussed in our
next meeting, we do hope that our governments will raise this issue at an
appropriate time," Chiang said at a conference held to discuss Taiwan's future.</P>
      <P>His remarks came one day after the honorary chairman of Taiwan's ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) Lien Chan said at a joint forum of the KMT and the Communist
Party of China (CPC) in Shanghai that establishing amechanism for economic and
trade cooperation would be of strategic value to both sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Lien said the two sides should forge a viable mechanism for normalizing their
trade and economic relations, since China has become Taiwan's most important
trade partner and largest export market.</P>
      <P>"Lien made those comments because President Ma Ying-jeou promised in his
election campaign to raise the issue of economic and trade cooperation between
Taiwan and China, " Chiang said. "This is very important to the future
development of cross-strait ties."</P>
      <P>Chiang said that Taiwan could find itself at a disadvantage in the region as it
is not a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and in
light of an agreement among ASEAN and the plus three nations -- China, Japan and
South Korea -- to end trade tariffs.</P>
      <P>Therefore, economic and trade cooperation with mainland China will be crucial to
Taiwan's future economic development, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>The SEF chairman said his third meeting with Chen next year will focus on mutual
investment, food safety, tax issues, intellectual property rights and crime
fighting.</P>
      <P>"However, we will discuss economic and trade cooperation with mainland China in
the near future," he added.</P>
      <P>In their second meeting Nov. 3-7 in Taiwan, Chen and Chiang sealed four
agreements on expanded direct cross-strait air services, direct shipping and
postal links, and a communication channel on food safety issues. Their historic
first meeting was held six months earlier in Beijing.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang and the opposition Democratic Progressive Party have each
decided to cut their year-end bonuses to their staff, as both parties are
feeling the squeeze of the global economic downturn.</P>
      <P>However, the administrations of the two parties gave the assurance that despite
the challenging financial environment, their workers will receive bonuses,
albeit smaller ones, because they have worked hard during the year.</P>
      <P>"No matter how tough the economic situation, we will take care of our staff,"
said Lin Yung-rey, a KMT administrative official. "We will tighten our belts and
withstand these tough economic times."</P>
      <P>Lin said that the KMT will pay an average of half a month's salary to all staff
members, which will amount to least NT$10,000 (US$303) each.</P>
      <P>"No matter what, the KMT will not lay off staff or cut salaries," he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that in the past, when the economy was good, the KMT paid year-end
bonuses of around one to one and a half months' salary, he said that with a
current staff of 900, it will cost the party a lot to pay even the reduced
bonuses this year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the DPP has decided to give an across-the-board bonus of NT$10,000 to
its staff, according to the party's chief communications officer Cheng Wen-
tsang.</P>
      <P>The DPP, in the past, gave its staff one month to one and a half months' salary
in bonuses when the economy was stronger," Cheng recalled.</P>
      <P>However this year, because of the economic situation, the 102 staff members of
the party will each receive a fixed amount of NT$10,000, he added.</P>
      <P>Cheng commended the staff of the opposition party for their</P>
      <P>work in the past year, adding that the DPP will host a traditional Lunar year-
end party for its workers and that DPP Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen will pay for it
from her own pocket. The KMT will hold its end-of-year party for its staff on
Jan. 21, 2009.</P>

      <P>Law-enforcement agents in southern Taiwan have seized 40 kilograms of marijuana
that was smuggled into the country from Latin America via China, the southern

disclosed Sunday.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the unit said that its investigators and police officers from

      <P>Hualien County is slated to hold its first Pacific International Tourism
Festival Dec. 26 to Jan. 2009 at its Meiluen Brewery, in the hope of attracting
more visitors from around the world, an event organizer said Monday.</P>
      <P>In the face of the global economic recession, Taiwan has been working hard to
attract foreign tourists by highlighting its special features and cultural
characteristics,  according to Kuomintang Legislator Fu Kun-chi of Hualien.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, Hualien County plans to launch the festival with a focus on
luring foreign tourists to view the first sunrise of 2009 from the coastal
county overlooking the Pacific Ocean, Fu said.</P>
      <P>The festival will target tourists from China, Europe and North America who plan
to ring in the Chinese New Year in Asia, urging them to make Hualien their
destination instead of Thailand or the Philippines, Fu said.</P>
      <P>By staging the festival, the county hopes to sell itself as aworld-famous
landmark on the Western Pacific Coast, Fu added.</P>
      <P>Activities during the 10-day festival will include a large scale pop concert
that will feature  nearly  100 local performers, international concerts, light
aircraft shows, and several exhibitions of defense weapon systems, motorcycles,
art works and aboriginal handicraft.</P>
      <P>The event organizers will also hold a lucky draw, with 200 tickets for Taipei-

      <P>The number of charter flights between Taiwan and China is likely to be increased
from the current 108 per week to 168 during the Lunar New Year holiday, which
begins Jan. 25, Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Deputy Chairman Kao
Koong-lian said in Shanghai Sunday.</P>
      <P>Kao, who also serves as the SEF's secretary-general, is in Shanghai to attend
the fourth Cross-Straits Economic, Trade and Cultural Forum as part of the
Taiwan delegation.</P>
      <P>He told Taiwanese businessmen in Shanghai that the SEF, aware that tickets for
cross-strait flights during the Lunar New Year holiday have been sold out, is
trying to negotiate with its Chinese counterpart -- the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) -- to increase the number of flights
to 168 per week.</P>
      <P>Lee Lung-wen, director-general of Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration
(CAA), appeared optimistic about the proposal, saying that the agreement on
direct flights across the Taiwan Strait, signed in Taipei in early November,
allows for flexibility in terms of the number of flights.</P>

companies can adjust their flight schedules in time.</P>

      <P>Certain restrictions or conditions will remain in place when the current
regulations are revised to make it easier for senior officials and military
personnel to visit China, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Liu was responding to criticism that the planned lifting of restrictions on
visits to China by senior officials and servicemen could put national security
at risk.</P>
      <P>Opposition  Taiwan Solidarity Union Chairman Huang Kun-huei suggested earlier in
the day that civil servants in charge of tasks related with classified
intelligence should not be allowed to visit China.</P>
      <P>In response, Liu said relevant government agencies are still working on a legal
amendment package which, while paving the way for senior civil servants,
political appointees, top executives of state-owned enterprises and military
personnel to visit China for business purposes or pleasure trips, will retain
certain restrictions on such travel.</P>
      <P>The premier first indicated Friday that the Cabinet is working toward the goal
of lifting the travel restrictions, which apply to civil servants at grade 11 or
higher, political appointees, top executives of state-owned enterprises and
military personnel.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Liao Liou-yi said Saturday that the government will make sure

      <P>China should open its infrastructure construction  projects to Taiwanese bidders
as part of mutual cooperation  efforts to cope with the current global economic
recession,  the head of Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang (KMT) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung made the appeal at the opening session of the fourth
Cross-Strait Economic, Trade and Cultural Forum, co-organized by the KMT and the
Communist Party of China (CPC).</P>
      <P>Wu said he looks forward to China's opening of its immense public infrastructure
construction market to Taiwanese bidders.</P>
      <P>In the next two years, China will pump 4 trillion yuan (about US$586 billion)
into its economy to help spur domestic demand and sustain overall growth amid
the lingering global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>"Hopefully, Taiwanese bidders will be given access to China's public works
construction projects," Wu said, adding that Taiwan will also be willing to open
its market to Chinese contractors.</P>
      <P>By so doing, Wu said, the two sides will be able to mutually invest and learn
from each other's experience in project management and the development of new
engineering technologies.</P>
      <P>Wu further expressed hopes that the two sides will explore a feasible mode for
mutual cooperation in the financial field, and in particular devise measures to
help a large number of Taiwan-owned businesses in China obtain working capital
or bank loans to keep their companies afloat in the midst of the current
worldwide economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Promotional efforts should also be intensified to galvanize more Chinese
citizens into making pleasure trips to Taiwan now that direct cross-strait
charter flights have been expanded to a daily service from the weekends-only
formula, Wu added.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, KMT honorary Chairman Lien Chan said the two
sides should forge a viable mechanism for normalizing their trade and economic
relations, since China has become Taiwan's most important trade partner and
largest export market.</P>
      <P>"It's strategically significant for our two sides to thrash out a comprehensive
mechanism for normal trade and economic exchanges and cooperation across the
Taiwan Strait," Lien explained, adding that he hopes the ongoing two-day KMT-CPC
forum can come up with concrete proposals in this regard.</P>
      <P>Five Taiwan government officials, including Shan Chi, vice chairman of the
Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development, are attending the
party-to-party forum in a private capacity.</P>
      <P>Shan delivered a speech on Taiwan's general economic situation and prospects for
cross-strait economic cooperation, making him the first senior Taiwan government
official ever to speak in the KMT-CPC forum.</P>
      <P>In his address, Shan suggested that the two sides explore the feasibility of
taking part in each other's economic stimulus projects to accelerate recovery of
their economies.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday that in light of the rising unemployment in

      <P>CNA staff writer</P>
      <P>Spanish tenor Jose Carreras thrilled a packed audience of over 50,000 at the
Miaoli County Stadium on a warm November evening this year, in the kind of show
that is rarely seen in the predominantly agricultural county in north-central
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In an innovative show of generosity, the Miaoli county government gave out
40,000 free tickets for the show, but more than 50,000 people showed up on the
night.</P>
      <P>Although the organizers opened the side gate of the stadium to let in some of
the disappointed hopefuls half an hour after the concert began, there were still
some 10,000 people left sitting on a riverbank near the stadium who had to make
do with listening to a live broadcast of the internationally renowned maestro's
performance.</P>
      <P>Despite causing traffic jams in the normally serene hilly city, the
unprecedented concert raised the self-esteem of Miaoli folks, who felt
privileged and respected by the county government as a result of the concert.</P>
      <P>The county government spent NT$20 million (US$597,000) to line up the concert --
a move initiated by Magistrate Liu Cheng-hung, who once said that it makes his
heart ache to see Miaoli County, long considered a "cultural desert, " left out
each time a major cultural event has taken place in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The rare concert, open to all, also helped attract many visitors from further
afield than Miaoli who spent money in the county, which Liu had anticipated.</P>
      <P>Liu, a six-term Kuomintang legislator, in 2005 became the first non-Hakka
magistrate in the history of Miaoli County -- a major Hakka area in Taiwan with
a Hakka population of 70 percent.</P>
      <P>"Hakka" literally means "guest people." Roughly 27 percent of Taiwan's
population  consider themselves  descendants  of Hakka ancestors, believed to
have emigrated from the Yellow River area some 1,000 years ago to southern China
to escape war and famine and who thereafter  moved to Taiwan and represent a
sizeable diaspora elsewhere in the world.</P>
      <P>The happy times didn't stop with Carreras. Miaoli residents were entertained
Dec. 3-5 by another globally famous group -- the Irish River Dance -- with
tickets available to the locals at giveaway prices, also partially financed by
the county government.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, when the motion picture 1895, a Hakka-language epic portraying one of
the biggest battles in the history of Taiwan, was released in early November,
Liu's office treated Miaoli residents to free screenings.</P>
      <P>Not a dry eye in the house as the movie, based on a novel by one of Taiwan's
best-known Hakka writers, Li Chiao, brings to life Hakka militia resistance to
Japanese troops after Qing Dynasty China was defeated in the First Sino-Japanese
War (1894-95) and ceded Taiwan to Tokyo under the Treaty of Shimonoseki.</P>
      <P>During those days of cultural entertainment, reservations for rooms in hotels,
hostels and guest houses scattered around Miaoli County were all booked, shops
and restaurants were packed, and business operators were smiling from ear to ear
at their good fortune.</P>
      <P>The treats were actually feedback to the Miaoli folks, paid for out of prize
money that Liu and his administration won from the central government in an
investment inducement competition.</P>
      <P>Miaoli County won first prize -- a handsome NT$100 million -- in the Level B
investment inducement competition for successfully inducing several
manufacturing companies to relocate some of their investments to Miaoli,
traditionally an agricultural area and a relative backwater in terms of business
and industry.</P>
      <P>Liu personally gave briefings during the competition on how the county succeeded
in persuading  leading  hi-tech manufacturing companies, including the Hon Hai
Group -- the world's largest contract  maker of consumer  electronics  by
revenue --  into establishing factories in Miaoli to take advantage of the
area's inexpensive land, labor force and all relevant costs, an endeavor Liu
said has in turn infused new life and energy into the county's economy.</P>
      <P>In order to rev up the county's slumping economy, Liu has pulled out all the
stops, including moves to take full advantage when the Executive Yuan
distributes free shopping vouchers nationwide in January to spur spending and
bolster economic growth.</P>
      <P>Liu, the shrewd and industrious son of a farmer who became head of farmers'
associations in the Miaoli area at a very young age before climbing the
political ladder to become a legislator and then magistrate, has decided to
invest NT$10 million to generate business on the back of the shopping vouchers.</P>
      <P>His office announced recently that every person who spends NT$5,000 in the
county, including the NT$3,600 shopping vouchers that each Taiwan citizen will
receive from Jan. 18, will be entered in a lucky draw, with prizes including 10
luxury cars, 100 TFT-LED televisions,  refrigerators  and many other hi-tech
health and entertainment gear.</P>
      <P>Liu reckons that if all 560,000 Miaoli residents spend their shopping vouchers
in the county, business worth over NT$2.8 billion will be generated in a span of
nine months, which in turn will create over NT$70 million in tax revenues for
the county coffers. The vouchers will remain valid from Jan. 18 until Sept. 30
next year.</P>
      <P>Liu, who has been learning the Hakka dialect since being elected magistrate and
who has even sat Cabinet-sponsored Hakka language tests in order to bridge the
conversation gap with his constituents, is not all business, however.</P>
      <P>With the remaining funds that his administration won in the investment
inducement competition, he was instrumental in helping care for youths from
destitute families or those who were marked for special discipline because of
behavioral problems.</P>
      <P>After finding out from social workers that many young people in the county have
never gone on a leisure outing with their parents because of poverty or other
reasons, Liu decided to give each such youth -- around 3,300 -- NT$1,500 so that
they could go out with their parents or guardians to spend some "quality time,"
even just once.</P>
      <P>Liu, who has never ceased striving over the past three years to improve the
county's development,  told CNA that his greatest aspiration is to turn Miaoli
into a city suitable for investment, good for living and attractive for tourists
by the time he finishes his two four-year stints in 2013.</P>
      <P>He echoed the motto that his predecessor, Hsieh Chin-ting, passed on to him when
he was sworn in three years ago that as a magistrate, he will "leave morality to
the offspring, development to the county and only my name to myself."</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF pushes for increased number of cross-strait charter flights</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's intermediary Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)  has been working to
secure an agreement on increasing the number of direct cross-Taiwan Strait
charter flights to 168 per week during the upcoming Lunar New Year holidays from
the current 108, according an SEF official.</P>
      <P>SEF Vice Chairman Kao Koong-lian  was quoted by the Hong Kong-based daily Wen
Wei Po as saying Saturday that the SEF is currently negotiating with the
relevant Chinese authorities to increase the number of charters over the Chinese
New Year to accommodate the many Taiwanese businesspeople and their dependents
who usually return to Taiwan at that time.</P>
      <P>Kao was quoted as telling the 20-odd heads of Taiwanese business associations
around China during a meeting in the southern Chinese city of Xiamen that "there
might be good news in this regard before the 2009 Chinese New Year's Day," which
falls on Jan. 26.</P>
      <P>Kao, who doubles as secretary-general of the quasi-official SEF, made the
remarks after a Wuhan-based Taiwanese businessman Yu Ming-chin stated at the
meeting that the current 108 cross-strait flights per week can only accommodate
around 1.5 million Taiwanese travelers a year.</P>
      <P>"That is inadequate by far to meet actual demand, as Taiwanese make roughly 6
million visits to and from China each year, " said Yu, who is a vice chairman of
the Association of Taiwanese Invested Enterprises on the Mainland.</P>
      <P>"About 70 percent of the Taiwanese who frequently visit China will not be able
to enjoy the convenience of traveling via the existing cross-strait charter
flights," Yu claimed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to the Wen Wei Po report, Kao said that following his own
visits to China to listen to the needs and problems of Taiwanese businesspeople
there, SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung will also meet with Taiwanese business
leaders in Guangdong Province and Jiangsu Province from Jan. 7-11.</P>
      <P>Issues expected to be discussed during the meetings between Chiang and the
Taiwanese business leaders include fund constraints, ways of extending loans to
Taiwanese businesses, and the problems they have been facing as result of higher
taxes and overhead costs since China's implementation of new labor contract and
land use laws.</P>
      <P>According to Kao, Chiang and the SEF officials will also discuss the reduction
of customs tariffs with their Chinese counterparts, a move that may eventually
lead to developing the two sides of the Taiwan Strait as free trade zones, the
Wen Wei Po reported.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) on Sunday encouraged people facing sudden
financial difficulties and other problems due to the current economic recession
to phone the "1957 national welfare hotline" for help.</P>
      <P>The central government, in collaboration with local governments, set up the
hotline in November 2006 to provide timely help to people with dire problems.
The service offers on-site visits, emergency relief, employment assistance and
legal counseling.</P>
      <P>So far this year, an average of 1,000-1,990 calls per month were made to the
hotline, with most callers seeking emergency relief, unemployment support, and
medical treatment aid, according to the ministry.</P>
      <P>Many people have successfully overcome their difficulties with the help of the
service provided via the hotline, the MOI said.</P>
      <P>The ministry cited the example of a man surnamed Hsiung in Taoyuan County, who
was granted urgent financial subsidies at first and later landed a job with the
help of the local government's employment center after he made a call earlier in
the year to the hotline seeking assistance.</P>
      <P>At the time, Hsiung had suffered a number of blows in quick succession and was
reeling from the death of his wife, the loss of his job and his financial
inability to look after his young child, according to the MOI.</P>
      <P>Usually, there is a spike in the number of calls just before the Chinese New
Year, the MOI said, noting that 1,991 calls were recorded in January, the
highest number for the year so far.</P>
      <P>The ministry anticipates that more and more people will be seeking urgent help,
in light of the increasing number of businesses that are failing and the rising
unemployment in the country due to the economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it said, it is urging people with problems to call the hotline to
obtain help.</P>

      <P>The second round of applications for a government-sponsored housing subsidy that
will help cover rental and interest payments has now been opened, the
Construction and Planning Agency announced Sunday, urging eligible families to
apply at their local household registry office.</P>
      <P>Under the program, the government will offer a subsidy of up to NT$3,000 per
month for one year to eligible families to help them cover their rent, the
agency under the Ministry of the Interior said.</P>
      <P>The government will also subsidize the interest payments by new home buyers on
loans of up to NT$2.2 million with a 20-year repayment period. Borrowers of
house repair loans of up to NT$800,000 with an 15-year repayment period are also
elegible to apply for subsidies to help pay the interest, according to the
agency.</P>
      <P>Applications for the rental subsidy will expire Dec. 31 this year, while
applications for government-subsidized home loans will expire Feb. 25, 2009, the
agency said.</P>
      <P>The agency first announced the program earlier in the year, calling for
applications, which closed on Aug. 15.</P>
      <P>In the second application phase, there are 8,000 openings for rental subsidies,
25,445 for home loan subsidies, and 3,720 for home improvement loan subsidies,
according to the agency.</P>
      <P>Under the program, the preferential interest rate on loans to eligible
households is 1.617 percent, and on those to disadvantaged families 1.042
percent. The country's central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate by
three-quarters of a percentage point earlier in the month, the agency noted.</P>
      <P>This home purchase  loan scheme  will be administered  in conjunction with
another preferential home loan program launched on Sept. 22, under which the
government will allocate an additional NT$200 billion until Sept. 21, 2010 to
grant each qualified household in Taipei City a maximum loan of NT$3.5 million
at a preferential interest rate, the agency added.</P>
      <P>For eligible households outside Taipei City, the maximum figure for such loans
is NT$3 million.</P>
      <P>Families with an annual combined income of less than NT$970,000 and who do not
own a home can apply for a home purchase loan or a housing rental subsidy, while
those who own a house that is more than 10 years old can apply for a house
improvement loan, according to the agency.</P>

      <P>China's top official in charge of Taiwan affairs announced 10 measures Sunday to
boost business and trade exchanges with Taiwan and increase financial assistance
to Taiwanese businesspeople operating on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Wang Yi, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council,  said
Chinese  banking institutions,  including  China Development Bank, Bank of China
and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, will be authorized to increase
their loans and credit services, to a maximum of 130 billion Chinese yuan
(US$18.99 billion), to China-based Taiwanese enterprises over the next three
years to help them tide over the difficulties they face in the global economic
downturn.</P>
      <P>Wang made the announcement at the fourth joint Cross-Strait Economic, Trade and
Cultural Forum held by Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang and the Communist Party of
China (CPC). The forum opened in Shanghai Saturday and closed Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the Chinese authorities will help China-based Taiwanese
enterprises to upgrade or restructure so as to sharpen their competitiveness.</P>
      <P>China will push for increased bilateral investment across the Taiwan Strait and
will help boost cooperation among industrial manufacturing sectors on both sides
to make them more competitive in the international market, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese TFT-LED TV manufacturers will increase purchases of display
panels from Taiwanese makers, with the shopping list to total US$2 billion in
the initial stage, Wang said.</P>
      <P>China will also expand agricultural cooperation with Taiwan, Wang said, adding
that three Chinese provinces -- Jiangsu, Guangdong and Yunnan -- will make
tracts of land available exclusively for Taiwanese farmers to develop farms in
China.</P>
      <P>China and Taiwan should expedite  negotiations  on affairs pertaining to customs
clearance and quarantine procedures so as to speed up Taiwan's sale of seafood
and other fresh grocery products to Chinese markets, Wang suggested.</P>
      <P>China will also allow Taiwanese lawyers to practice in China once they comply
with certain conditions set by the Chinese government, he added.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung and KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan led a party
delegation at the forum. Five Taiwan government officials, including San Gee,
vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and
Development, also attended the party-to-party forum in a private capacity.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Smoking lawmakers to adjust to smoke-free work environment</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Inveterate smokers in the legislature are preparing to adjust to a smoke-free
work environment from Jan. 11, when Taiwan's newly amended Tobacco Hazards
Prevention Act becomes effective.</P>
      <P>Asked on Friday to comment on the change dictated by law, Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said the legislature will do everything in accordance with
the law, and that from Jan. 11, none of the legislators, their constituents or
staff will be allowed to smoke on the premises of the legislature.</P>
      <P>Under the amended Tobacco Hazards Prevention Act, smoking is banned in all
indoor workplaces staffed by three or more employees.</P>
      <P>The law also prohibits smoking in other public indoor areas, such as KTV
lounges, bowling alleys, cybercafes, and passenger waiting rooms.</P>
      <P>Smoking is also banned, under the law, in outdoor public areas, including train
station platforms, gymnasiums,  swimming pools, college campuses, and
entertainment areas.</P>
      <P>Violators will risk fines of between NT$2,000 and NT$10,000 (US$605).</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Secretary-General Lin Hsi-shan pointed out that under the new
law the legislature is not permitted to designate a smoking area within the
building and that legislators who wish to smoke will have to do so outside the
building.</P>
      <P>Lee Hung-chun, a legislator of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) who has been a smoker
since he was a student more than 30 years ago, said it may be time now for him
to quit the habit because of the inconvenience of finding a place to smoke.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Tsai Chin-lung, who has already kicked his 30-year habit,
encouraged his colleagues to follow his example and quit smoking.</P>
      <P>"If they really cannot kick the habit, they must be more observant of the new
law than the ordinary public," he said.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Shuai Hua-ming said he will respect other people's right to
refuse to inhale second-hand smoke, and that when he feels like smoking, he will
go outside the building.</P>
      <P>Legislator Ker Chien-ming, the chain-smoking legislative caucus convener of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , said he still has reservations
about whether it might be difficult to comply with the law, but added that he
will do his best.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Pan Meng-an said jokingly that he will probably go into
depression because of the new law, but he added, "I am afraid that I may have to
quit smoking."</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Tien Chiu-chin, who has campaigned hard against smoking, said
that smoking has become such a serious public hazard that it is necessary to
maintain a smoke-free work environment.</P>
      <P>She quoted an estimate by the Cabinet-level Department of Health which shows
that smoking-induced diseases have cost the Bureau of National Insurance an
extra NT$30 billion (US$922.58 million) a year in terms of medical expenses.</P>

      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said Sunday that economic
and trade cooperation agreements will not be part of his third meeting with
President of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS)
Chen Yunlin.</P>
      <P>"However, although economic and trade cooperation will not be discussed in our
next meeting, we do hope that our governments will raise this issue at an
appropriate time," Chiang said at a conference held to discuss Taiwan's future.</P>
      <P>His remarks came one day after the honorary chairman of Taiwan's ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) Lien Chan said at a joint forum of the KMT and the Communist
Party of China (CPC) in Shanghai that establishing amechanism for economic and
trade cooperation would be of strategic value to both sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Lien said the two sides should forge a viable mechanism for normalizing their
trade and economic relations, since China has become Taiwan's most important
trade partner and largest export market.</P>
      <P>"Lien made those comments because President Ma Ying-jeou promised in his
election campaign to raise the issue of economic and trade cooperation between
Taiwan and China, " Chiang said. "This is very important to the future
development of cross-strait ties."</P>
      <P>Chiang said that Taiwan could find itself at a disadvantage in the region as it
is not a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and in
light of an agreement among ASEAN and the plus three nations -- China, Japan and
South Korea -- to end trade tariffs.</P>
      <P>Therefore, economic and trade cooperation with mainland China will be crucial to
Taiwan's future economic development, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>The SEF chairman said his third meeting with Chen next year will focus on mutual
investment, food safety, tax issues, intellectual property rights and crime
fighting.</P>
      <P>"However, we will discuss economic and trade cooperation with mainland China in
the near future," he added.</P>
      <P>In their second meeting Nov. 3-7 in Taiwan, Chen and Chiang sealed four
agreements on expanded direct cross-strait air services, direct shipping and
postal links, and a communication channel on food safety issues. Their historic
first meeting was held six months earlier in Beijing.</P>

      <P>The ruling Kuomintang and the opposition Democratic Progressive Party have each
decided to cut their year-end bonuses to their staff, as both parties are
feeling the squeeze of the global economic downturn.</P>
      <P>However, the administrations of the two parties gave the assurance that despite
the challenging financial environment, their workers will receive bonuses,
albeit smaller ones, because they have worked hard during the year.</P>
      <P>"No matter how tough the economic situation, we will take care of our staff,"
said Lin Yung-rey, a KMT administrative official. "We will tighten our belts and
withstand these tough economic times."</P>
      <P>Lin said that the KMT will pay an average of half a month's salary to all staff
members, which will amount to least NT$10,000 (US$303) each.</P>
      <P>"No matter what, the KMT will not lay off staff or cut salaries," he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that in the past, when the economy was good, the KMT paid year-end
bonuses of around one to one and a half months' salary, he said that with a
current staff of 900, it will cost the party a lot to pay even the reduced
bonuses this year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the DPP has decided to give an across-the-board bonus of NT$10,000 to
its staff, according to the party's chief communications officer Cheng Wen-
tsang.</P>
      <P>The DPP, in the past, gave its staff one month to one and a half months' salary
in bonuses when the economy was stronger," Cheng recalled.</P>
      <P>However this year, because of the economic situation, the 102 staff members of
the party will each receive a fixed amount of NT$10,000, he added.</P>
      <P>Cheng commended the staff of the opposition party for their</P>
      <P>work in the past year, adding that the DPP will host a traditional Lunar year-
end party for its workers and that DPP Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen will pay for it
from her own pocket. The KMT will hold its end-of-year party for its staff on
Jan. 21, 2009.</P>

      <P>Hualien County is slated to hold its first Pacific International Tourism
Festival Dec. 26 to Jan. 2009 at its Meiluen Brewery, in the hope of attracting
more visitors from around the world, an event organizer said Monday.</P>
      <P>In the face of the global economic recession, Taiwan has been working hard to
attract foreign tourists by highlighting its special features and cultural
characteristics,  according to Kuomintang Legislator Fu Kun-chi of Hualien.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, Hualien County plans to launch the festival with a focus on
luring foreign tourists to view the first sunrise of 2009 from the coastal
county overlooking the Pacific Ocean, Fu said.</P>
      <P>The festival will target tourists from China, Europe and North America who plan
to ring in the Chinese New Year in Asia, urging them to make Hualien their
destination instead of Thailand or the Philippines, Fu said.</P>
      <P>By staging the festival, the county hopes to sell itself as aworld-famous

      <P>Activities during the 10-day festival will include a large scale pop concert
that will feature  nearly  100 local performers, international concerts, light

      <P>The number of charter flights between Taiwan and China is likely to be increased
from the current 108 per week to 168 during the Lunar New Year holiday, which
begins Jan. 25, Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Deputy Chairman Kao
Koong-lian said in Shanghai Sunday.</P>
      <P>Kao, who also serves as the SEF's secretary-general, is in Shanghai to attend
the fourth Cross-Straits Economic, Trade and Cultural Forum as part of the
Taiwan delegation.</P>
      <P>He told Taiwanese businessmen in Shanghai that the SEF, aware that tickets for
cross-strait flights during the Lunar New Year holiday have been sold out, is
trying to negotiate with its Chinese counterpart -- the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) -- to increase the number of flights
to 168 per week.</P>
      <P>Lee Lung-wen, director-general of Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration
(CAA), appeared optimistic about the proposal, saying that the agreement on
direct flights across the Taiwan Strait, signed in Taipei in early November,
allows for flexibility in terms of the number of flights.</P>
      <P>Lee said there is still enough time to thrash out the issue so that the airline
companies can adjust their flight schedules in time.</P>
      <P>However, ARATS Deputy Secretary-general Li Ya-fei declined to comment on the
issue, saying only that he needs to look into the matter.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Experts discuss possibility of building cross-strait expressway</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 22 (CNA)
12/22/08  13:52:44
(By Luis Yu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After the long-expected direct air, shipping and postal links between Taiwan and
China were put in place last week, academics and experts from both sides
gathered Monday to discuss the possibility of building a physical structure to
link Taipei to Beijing.</P>
      <P>The formal opening of a two-day academic conference to discuss the feasibility
of constructing a cross-Taiwan Strait expressway was attended by representatives
from both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation Chiang Pin-kung said at the opening
that the exchange of ideas and expertise on the design for such a route has the
same "historical significance" as the improvement of cross-strait relations
which was facilitated by his meeting in November with his counterpart Chen
Yunlin of China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>"The construction of a Taiwan Strait expressway will further narrow the cultural
and economic gap between the two sides", said Chiang, adding that "it is the
common desire of the people of both Taiwan and China to see the realization of
such a historic project."</P>
      <P>The idea of a physical route to link Taipei and Beijing has been in the works in
China for years. The project was included in an expressway network plan
announced by China in 2005 to build 85,000 kilometers of expressways over a
30-year period at an estimated cost of 2 trillion yuan (about US$240 billion),
including one from Beijing to Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chiang said that a Beijing-Taipei expressway would further facilitate the
transportation of Taiwanese products to China, Russia and Eastern Europe.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Strait Crossing Route Academic Conference has been held twice a year
for the past 12 years in China, with the participation of experts from Taiwan
and China, but this is the first time that it is being held in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The conference will discuss basic aspects of the proposed Taiwan Strait
expressway, including design philosophy, concept, and basic requirements.</P>
      <P>Such a route would involve the construction of infrastructure such as undersea
tunnels and bridges. It would also require studies on weather,  seawater  depth,
marine  sediments  and seafloor characteristics -- topics that will be discussed
at the conference in order to contribute to the preliminary planning and design
stages of the proposed project.</P>
      <P>According to Hsai Yang-fang, a professor at the University of North Carolina,
Charlotte, the term "Taiwan Strait Tunnel" was first coined in the summer of
1948 in Taipei by thousands of anti-civil war students who were marching to
demand the coexistence of all Chinese people.</P>
      <P>Since the Kuomintang (KMT) returned to power in May, President Ma Ying-jeou's
administration has been working to melt the ice between the two sides of the
strait and forge links with China, particularly on the economic front.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are quasi-official organizations responsible for handling
cross-strait engagements in the absence of official relations between the two
sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>In their second round of their talks held in Taipei Nov. 3-7, Chiang and Chen
signed four agreements to allow direct flights, shipping links, postal services
and the establishment of a food safety mechanism between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Chen was the highest-ranking Chinese official to have set foot on Taiwan since
the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Peace accord, greater international space remain top goals: KMT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Shanghai,  Dec.  22  (CNA)
12/22/08  14:11:23
(By Chang Ming-kun and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wu Poh-hsiung, chairman of Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang (KMT) , said Sunday that
securing a peace accord with China and seeking greater international space for
Taiwan remain the party's  top goals and this will not change  under  any
circumstances.</P>
      <P>The two goals were included in a five-point statement issued jointly in 2005 by
Chinese President Hu Jintao and then KMT Chairman Lien Chan after their historic
meeting in Beijing on April 29 that year, Wu said at a news conference prior to
his departure for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu and a KMT delegation have been in Shanghai to attend the fourth joint Cross-
Strait Economic, Trade and Cultural Forum held by the KMT and the Communist
Party of China (CPC) in Shanghai Saturday and Sunday.</P>
      <P>In response to reporters' questions on whether he had exchanged views with the
CPC officials at forum about the prospects of Taiwan's attendance at the World
Health Assembly (WHA) as an observer in May 2009, Wu said the forum was focused
on economic and business matters, therefore the WHA and other political issues
were not raised.</P>
      <P>However, he said, Taiwan's goals of seeking greater maneuvering space in the
international community and securing a peace accord with Beijing remain the two
top priorities of the KMT as the ruling party.</P>
      <P>"The peace accord, nevertheless, is a more challenging goal for the time being,"
Wu admitted.</P>
      <P>With both sides facing challenges amid a global economic downturn the forum
decided to temporarily shelve controversial issues and seek consensus on
negotiable matters, he said.</P>
      <P>"It takes time and patience for both sides to address their political
differences," he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu said, he will report to President Ma Ying-jeou and Premier Liu
Chao-shiuan Monday evening on the conclusions of the forum and the suggestions
that were made by the KMT and CPC on the development of cross-strait relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Group encourages unemployed women to work as babysitters</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 22 (CNA)

(By Y.L. Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Peng Wan-ru Foundation, an organization that helps local women to enter the
labor force,  encouraged unemployed women of middle age and older to seek
positions as babysitters for newborns and as caregivers for new mothers.</P>
      <P>Liu Yu-hsiu, director of the foundation, said Sunday at a party for 300
babysitters and family caregivers that the demand for home caregivers remains
high despite the current economic recession.</P>
      <P>The foundation has been providing training courses on babysitting and postpartum
health care for five years, but not many women have joined the program, Liu
said.</P>
      <P>She added that some mothers would offer around NT$42,000 per month to hire a
babysitter that can look after their newborns and help the women themselves
during the post-delivery recuperation period. This would cost such families much
less than if they have to pay NT$150,000 per month for similar services provided
by some nursing centers, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Noting that babysitting and home care services are less affected by the economic
slowdown, Liu called on women who want to work in this area to join the
foundation's professional training program to gain the skills required by their
potential employers.</P>
      <P>At a time when all sectors have being hit by the overall economic slump, an
increasing number of people have been contacting the foundation to explore job
opportunities, according to Wang Hui-chu, chief executive of the foundation.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the foundation decided to enroll more babysitting trainees in their
40s and 50s so that middle-aged women can re-enter the workplace and earn a
stable living by caring for babies and new mothers, according to Wang.</P>
      <P>Describing the job as a physically demanding, Wang said that caregivers need to
help postpartum women bind or bandage their bellies after birth, give them
massages, and help to bathe them.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the job requires tender and compassionate care and good communication
skills, Wang added.</P>
      <P>Trainees can acquire all the necessary knowledge, skills and techniques  in the
six-week training  programs offered by the foundation, according to Wang.</P>
      <P>At the party, a babysitter known as Li-hsue, said that she began working in that
field four years ago after she was forced out of her job of more than 10 years
as an accountant.</P>
      <P>According to Li-hsiu, she has worked for about 40 families in the last four
years and has gained a sense of accomplishment from providing professional
services to those families.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Legislature not yet decided on tobacco tax increase rate</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22 (CNA)
12/22/08  17:17:48
(By Emmanuelle Tzeng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Legislative Yuan committee on Monday initially  approved a draft amendment  to
the Tobacco Hazards Prevention Act, but set aside a controversial article on the
increase of the health tax on tobacco products for further discussion by
political party caucuses.</P>
      <P>The legislature's  Health,  Environment and Labor Committee approved amendments
to raise the "health and welfare surcharge" on tobacco products and remove the
ceiling on such increases.</P>
      <P>The draft amendment also aims to use the revenues from the health tax to
subsidize medical treatment for the disadvantaged, including the indigent, those
with rare diseases, and those living in areas where medical resources are
inadequate.</P>
      <P>Although the legislators in the committee all agreed that the surcharge should
be increased, they failed to reach consensus on the percentage by which it
should raised.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health's (DOH) proposal was to raise the
surcharge from the current NT$10 (US$0.31) to NT$20, a hike that most of the
legislators supported. But Chang Sho-wen, a 37-year-old Kuomintang legislator
who has been smoking for 20 years, insisted that the tax should be increased to
NT$40.</P>
      <P>The purpose of raising the surcharge is to reduce the number of smokers in the
country," he said, adding that, in view of that goal, an increase of NT$10 seems
to be insignificant.</P>
      <P>He further suggested that the revenue from the tax should be used in the
prevention of cancer and other diseases related to smoking.</P>
      <P>However, DOH Minister Yeh Ching-chuan contended it would be "difficult" to raise
the surcharge on tobacco to NT$40. There is "a gap between the ideal and
reality," he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan spends about NT$45 billion annually on health insurance to cover medical
treatment of diseases related to smoking, according to the DOH.</P>
      <P>In its review of the bill, the committee suggested that the DOH and the Ministry
of Finance implement on a one-year trial basis a tobacco certification system in
order to reduce the smuggling of cigarettes.</P>
      <P>The Tobacco Hazards Prevention Act, which will go into effect on Jan. 11 next
year, bans smoking in schools, medical and financial institutions, government
units, restaurants, transport stations and shopping centers.</P>
      <P>According  to the World  Health  Organization,  non-smoking environments and
high tobacco prices are the two most effective means of reducing tobacco use
among young people. A 1999 World Bank report stated that when the price of
tobacco is raised by 10 percent, consumption decreases by 4 percent to 8
percent, and even by as much as 10 percent among youngsters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Pandas to arrive at Taipei Zoo Dec. 23: Taipei City</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22 (CNA)
12/22/08  17:42:52

    <TEXT>
      <P>A pair of giant pandas China promised to give Taiwan in 2005 will finally arrive
at Taipei Zoo Dec. 23, a Taipei city government official confirmed Monday.</P>
      <P>Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan, whose names together mean "reunion, " should arrive at
the zoo before 7 p.m, according to zoo officials, who added that the zoo has
prepared an outdoor enclosure decorated with ferns and a footbridge, a sleeping
area with all-season air conditioning and imported bamboo to welcome the two
pandas.</P>
      <P>Estimating that the pandas will consume up to 80 kilograms of bamboo shoots
every day, the zoo will allocate NT$1.02 million (US$31,000) for bamboo expenses
per year.</P>
      <P>Upon their arrival, the pandas will be kept in quarantine for at least one month
before they are introduced to the public, with zoo officials hopeful that the
animals can make their debut around the Lunar New Year, which falls on Jan. 26
next year.</P>
      <P>EVA Airways, which has been commissioned to fly the pandas from the southwestern
Chinese province of Sichuan to Taiwan, has already sent an advance team to
Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, to go over technical details regarding
the charter flight from Shuangliu Airport to Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport.</P>
      <P>"Every arrangement will be made in the best interests of the pandas," said EVA
Air spokesman Nieh Kuo-wei.</P>
      <P>Chinese President Hu Jintao first offered the pandas to Taiwan as a gift of
friendship in May 2005 when then-opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan
made an ice-breaking visit to Beijing.</P>
      <P>However, the delivery was blocked by political bickering between Beijing and
Taipei during Taiwan's time under the rule of the now-opposition Democratic
Progressive Party,  which objected to China's treatment of the panda transfer as
a "domestic transfer" between zoos because it implies that Taiwan is part of
China.</P>
      <P>As giant pandas are an endangered species subject to the protection of the
Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora
(CITES), cross-border transfers of the animal must follow strict CITES
guidelines.</P>
      <P>According to the guidelines, the two parties must supply export and import
permits confirming that all conditions for the transfer have been met. This
implies that the transaction is between two countries.</P>
      <P>However, the issue was resolved under the governance of the China-leaning
administration of President Ma Ying-jeou when both sides decided to sidestep the
country name issue by agreeing to identify the importer as "Taiwan Taipei" and
accepting "Chengdu" as the origin of export.</P>
      <P>The two sides signed a formal agreement Nov. 6 on exchanges of indigenous rare
fauna and flora species to symbolize their amity and determination to cooperate
in wildlife conservation.</P>
      <P>According to the Taipei city government, the pandas are expected to attract 6
million domestic and overseas visitors to the zoo each year. More than 5 million
people visit the zoo each year to see its koalas, another of the zoo's flagship
denizens.</P>

      <P>The conclusions that were reached and the suggestions made in a just-concluded
forum between the ruling Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China (CPC) will
provide only "directions" for policy makers, the head of the intermediary
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Monday.</P>
      <P>"Solid negotiations on concrete matters and issues across the Taiwan Strait will
still have to rely on the quasi-official SEF and its Beijing counterpart, the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS)," said SEF Chairman
Chiang Pin-kung.</P>
      <P>The fourth joint Cross-Strait Economic, Trade and Cultural Forum held by the KMT
and CPC in Shanghai over the weekend made nine suggestions, including that the
number of charter flights between Taiwan and China be increased from the current
108 per week to 168 during the Lunar New Year holiday, which begins Jan. 25 this
year.</P>
      <P>During the forum, Wang Yi, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of China's
State  Council,  also  said that Chinese  banking institutions, including the
China Development Bank, the Bank of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank
of China, will be authorized to increase the size of the loans and credit
services they are allowed to offer to China-based Taiwanese enterprises to help
tide them over the difficulties they face amidst the global economic downturn.</P>
      <P>These loans could top 130 billion Chinese yuan (US$18.99 billion) over a span of
three years, Wang said.</P>
      <P>In response to the remarks by China's top official in charge of Taiwan affairs,
Chiang said he will pay closer attention to the loan promise and will make
follow-up suggestions after he visits China next month to meet Taiwanese
businessmen operating there.</P>
      <P>He added that after two rounds of SEF-ARATS meetings -- in June and November
this year, respectively -- the third one will be mainly devoted to technical
matters to help facilitate implementation of the policies and measures that were
recommended in the previous two meetings.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, the issue of signing a financial memorandum of
understanding (MOU) with China covering the banking, securities and insurance
sectors is expected to be discussed in the third round of talks, the date of
which has yet to be determined.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, SEF Deputy Chairman Kao Koong-lian said that day that it would be
unrealistic to attach too many expectations to the conclusions reached at the
forum.</P>
      <P>Upon the conclusion of the forum, China's top official in charge of Taiwan
affairs Wang Yi announced 10 measures to boost business and trade exchanges with
Taiwan and increase financial assistance to Taiwanese businessmen operating in
China.</P>
      <P>In addition to the loan promise, the measures include a promise that Chinese
TFT-LED TV manufacturers will increase purchases of display panels from
Taiwanese makers, with the shopping list to total US$2 billion in the initial
stage.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Wang's promises, Kao said they reflect that China is extending
increased goodwill to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he went on, the crucial element is whether and when those promises
will be delivered and carried out.</P>
      <P>Kao noted that the Chinese authorities promised some time ago that they would
make some 50 billion yuan available out of two Chinese state funds to be loaned
to Taiwanese businessmen to help facilitate their China operations.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, none of these businessmen were able to secure the loans
because the threshold set by the Chinese was too high.</P>
      <P>Kao said the Chinese authorities must first lower the threshold for such
"incentives" if they want to provide help to allow Taiwanese businessmen in
China to ride out the global financial meltdown.</P>

Friday between Taipei and the Cambodian city of Siem Reap, the gateway to the
world renowned temple complex of Angkor Wat.</P>
      <P>Joe Chu, the airline's sales manager, said that the new service will fill a gap
in market demand left by the previous airline that flew the route. It will also
save travel time to the famous Cambodian tourist attraction, which is listed as
a world heritage site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO).</P>
      <P>Far Eastern Air Transport,  which in cooperation with the Cambodia-based Angkor
Airways used to provide regularly scheduled flights on the route, canceled the
service in May due to financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>Chu said that TransAsia Airways, which will be the only airline serving the
route, will fly 15 charters a month, serving only tour groups and travelers that
join foreign independent travel (FTI) packages offered by the travel agencies.</P>
      <P>The initial response to the charter scheme, which will continue for at least for

      <P>A special EVA Airways flight arrived at the Chengdu  Shuangliu  International
Airport in Sichuan Province, southwestern China Monday in preparation for
delivering a pair of celebrity giant pandas to Taiwan the following day.</P>
      <P>The pandas, named Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan, are a gift from the Chinese
government to Taiwan as a symbol of good will and friendship.</P>
      <P>The EVA Airways charter plane took off Monday morning from Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport for Sichuan on a special flight to pick up the animals.</P>
      <P>On board was a group of 76 people who were slated to welcome the rare animals.
The group included animal keepers from the Taipei City Zoo, where the pandas
will be housed, and Taipei City officials headed by Yang Hsiao-tung, director of
the city's Department of Information and Tourism.</P>
      <P>Before boarding, Yang said that an advance mission from Taiwan had completed all
arrangements in Sichuan last week for the shipment of the animals. He further
said that after being apprised of the weather and the pandas' condition, he
expects that they will be brought to Taipei without a hitch.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Zoo Director Jason Yeh, also a member of the welcoming delegation,
said Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin asked him to take good care of the pandas and
bring them to Taipei safely.</P>
      <P>To this end, the zoo assigned an executive official responsible for animal
affairs and three experts in animal preservation to the welcoming team, he said.</P>
      <P>The newly expanded direct air links between Taiwan and China, which have
considerably cut the travel time between the two sides, will also help to make
the shipment smoother, Yeh said. Immediately afer the animals arrive at the
Taoyuan airport in Taiwan, they will be transported to the city zoo in an air
conditioned vehicle, he added.</P>
      <P>The EVA Airways "panda flight" is scheduled to take off from the Chengdu airport
at 2 p.m. Tuesday and arrive in Taiwan at around 5 p.m. the same day. A group
from China, comprised of panda keepers and other personnel, will be traveling
with the animals, while the flight will also transport 17 dove tree seedlings --
also a gift from China -- and 480 kg of China-grown bamboo and other food for
Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan.</P>
      <P>The crew on the special flight is comprised of experienced pilots and flight
attendants, headed by EVA Vice Chairman Hsieh Chih-chien.</P>

      <P>Around 22 percent of Taiwan's office workers have part time jobs, with 56
percent of them being driven to do such jobs because of the economic downturn,
according to results of a poll released Monday.</P>
      <P>Of the part-time job holders, 12.28 percent also have full-time jobs in addition
to their part-time work; while 9.64 percent have no other jobs, the poll
conducted by the 1111 job bank found.</P>
      <P>The study also showed that office workers and others with temporary jobs can
earn an extra NT$16,021 (US$327) per month on average from their part-time
employment.</P>
      <P>According to the job bank, an increasing number of people are starting small
businesses, returning to school for skills training or working part-time because
they are having problems finding full-time work.</P>
      <P>A higher percentage of workers of both genders aged over 41 years have part-time
jobs, compared to their counterparts aged below 40 -- reflecting a rising
jobless rate among middle-aged office workers, a job bank executive said.</P>
      <P>In addition, he pointed out, a larger percentage of women than men have
temporary work as more and more housewives hope to share their family's
financial burden amid growing financial difficulties in the current economic
recession.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the number of job application forms filled out on the job bank's
website increased by 43.39 percent in November, compared to the same month last
year.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the Cabinet-level Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) , in the first three quarters of this
year, Taiwanese workers' permanent salaries rose by 1.02 percent year-on-year on
average -- the lowest level in three years.</P>
      <P>Their real income recorded a negative 2.95 percent growth -- the largest
decrease since 1980, after taking into consideration the consumer price index,
the DGBAS statistics showed.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the number of Taiwan's jobless workers would further rise
to around 500,000 in November, affecting more than 1 million people, including
the jobless person and his or her family members. This is up from 476,000
unemployed people in October, which recorded a jobless rate of 4.37 percent.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's jobless rate stood at 3.84 percent in May, according to DGBAS
statistics.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that close to 47 percent of the office workers surveyed do
not moonlight because they have not found suitable part-time jobs, while some 33
percent cited a lack of time or their irregular work schedule as the reasons why
they do not hold part-time jobs.</P>
      <P>About 16 percent of the survey respondents voiced concern over their heavy
workload, the questionnaire discovered.</P>

      <P>More than 10 local garment stores have suffered combined losses of NT$50 million
(US$1.51 million) as a result of remittance fraud committed by a Chinese
brokerage firm known to them as Guangda Co., the Criminal Investigation Bureau
(CIB) said in a news release Monday.</P>
      <P>The stores, as well as various other Taiwanese importers, are vulnerable to this
type of remittance fraud due to the lack of direct remittance services between
Taiwan and China, CIB officials noted.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, many store owners have expressed strong hopes that
with the Dec. 15 implementation of direct transport and postal links between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait, it is now time to consider direct remittance
services so that importers can avoid being exploited  by middlemen  or becoming
targets for fraudsters.</P>
      <P>A store on the renowned Wufenpu business circle in Taipei's Sungshan district,
owned by a woman identified by her surname Wang, has been importing garments
from China for over 10 years. Wang recently began to use Guangda Co. as her
remittance broker, thinking she would be able to make savings on service
charges.</P>
      <P>She received a phone call one day from a person claiming to be Guangda's
accountant, who asked her to wire her payment to a different  bank account.
After remitting NT$1 million to the designated account, the company of course
vanished.</P>
      <P>The CIB said a garment store in Taichung County lost NT$400,000 in a similar
manner, while another in Taichung City lost NT$460,000.</P>
      <P>Further investigation by the CIB led to the discovery that Guangda Co. staff
called more than 10 garment stores in Taiwan at about the same time in early
December, asking them to wire their payments into a designated bank account.</P>
      <P>After raking some NT$50 million from the Taiwanese buyers, Guangda Co. dropped
under the radar, taking its clients' money with it, according to the CIB.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Representatives of employers and workers on Monday expressed hopes that a
planned increase in labor insurance premium rate, which is scheduled to go into
effect next year, can be postponed for one year, in order to avoid additional
pressure on management and employees under the current economic downturn.</P>
      <P>The representatives expressed their opinions at a public hearing held in the
Legislative Yuan. In attendance were legislators, representatives of workers'
unions and employers from around the island, as well as officials from the
Council of Labor Affairs.</P>
      <P>We suggested that the government postpone the implementation of the new premium
rate, or prepare a special budget to help employers and workers afford the
increase in premiums, said Lu Fu-tsai, a member of the Taipei-based Chinese
National Association of Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>The CLA should postpone the insurance premium increase for one year in order not
to create another financial burden for both laborers and employers, said Huang
Ying-hua, a representative of a workers' union from Taoyuan County in northern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to an amendment to the Labor Insurance Act approved in July, the
premium rate is supposed to be raised from the current 6.5 percent to 7.5
percent from January 1 next year.</P>
      <P>Pan Shih-wei, CLA deputy minister, told the employers and employees'
representatives that changing the labor insurance premium rate is a question of
amending the act, adding that the CLA supported all that is beneficial to
workers.</P>
      <P>Pan, however, did not say what the CLA would do to address the groups' demand.</P>
      <P>Employers and workers, meanwhile, disagreed on whether Taiwan should allow more
foreign workers or reduce the number of such workers during these economic
times.</P>
      <P>Huang stressed that the government should suspend introduction of foreign
workers in the manufacturing and construction industries and that enterprises
should not renew contracts with foreign workers already working in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also noted that a fund must be set up immediately to help laborers file
lawsuits against employers and protect their rights.</P>
      <P>Pan reiterated that the CLA vowed to undertake strict checks on the proportion
of national workers and foreign workers in factories and will not allow
employers to hire more foreign workers without legitimate reasons.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, when an enterprise plans to lay off Taiwanese workers, the
employer should ask if these workers are willing to undertake foreign
workersjob, which is usually more arduous.</P>
      <P>If Taiwanese workers agree,  the CLA plans to cancel the enterprises quota of
foreign workers, so as to protect local workersright to work.</P>
      <P>A plan regarding imposing a stricter policy on hiring foreign workers will be
presented soon, Pan added.</P>
      <P>Ho Yu,  who represents the Chinese National Federation of Industries, said
however that quotas of foreign workers should not be canceled, especially for
the so-called "3K" industries, which means "dirty,  dangerous  and  difficult",
in case  of an economic revitalization in the future.</P>
      <P>The Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics under the Executive
Yuan reported Monday that the latest unemployment rate has soared to 4.64
percent in November, an increase of 0.27 percent over October.</P>
      <P>The total number of jobless people increased to 507,000.</P>
      <P>The average unemployment rate from January to November this year is 4.06
percent, 0.14 percent higher compared to the same period last year, according to

      <P>Taiwan's workers faced an increasingly gloomy economic environment in November
as the unemployment rate rose to 4.64 percent,  from 4.37  percent  a month
earlier,  the Directorate-General of the Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS) announced Monday.</P>
      <P>The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 4.62 percent, or 0.33 percentage
points higher than in October.</P>
      <P>Taiwan had 507,000 jobless in November, with 202,000 of them having lost their
jobs through downsizing or company closures, a six-year high for the month,
according to DGBAS official Huang Jiann-jong.</P>
      <P>Particularly worrisome, Huang said, is that the number of laid-off workers
increased by 71,000 -- more than a third of the existing total -- during the
past three months.</P>
      <P>In addition, the number of jobless in the 45 to 64 age bracket averaged 86,000
from January to November, 14.94 percent higher than for the same period last
year. That represented the highest growth rate of unemployed among all age
brackets.</P>
      <P>Huang suggested that the sharp rise in jobless middle-aged workers required
attention, as the trend could impact families and society as a whole.</P>
      <P>Also worth noting, Huang said, is that the average unemployment rate during
January and November for workers with a bachelor's degree or higher reached 4.73
percent, the highest number among all educational levels.</P>
      <P>With the inclusion of November's numbers, unemployment in the first 11 months of
the year averaged 4.06 percent, or 0.14 percentage points higher than the same
period last year.</P>

      <P>The opening of daily nonstop charter flights between Taiwan and China has
effectively cut cross-Taiwan Strait travel times and costs, but it may also be
luring away local residents from traveling within the country, business sources
said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to industry insiders, many small hotels and inns in the Kending
National Park area in southern Taiwan's Hengchun Peninsula are facing sluggish
advanced bookings -- the worst in history.</P>
      <P>Rooms at local hotels were almost fully booked as the new year approached last
year, sources said, and hotel operators had hoped that the upcoming four-day
extended holiday from Jan. 1 to Jan. 4 would generate even stronger momentum for
their businesses.</P>
      <P>But those hopes have yet to be realized.</P>
      <P>Chung Tien-hui, who runs an inn in Kending targeting retail clients, said
potential occupancy rates for the coming holiday at most of the hotels and bed
and breakfast inns in the area remain "low" -- about 20 percent or 30 percent --
even though New Year's Day is only nine days away.</P>
      <P>Chung acknowledged that the recession has played a role in the area's poor
advance bookings but also suggested that the nonstop daily charters to China
inaugurated Dec. 15 deserved a share of the blame.</P>
      <P>The new service has made China-bound travel even more affordable and convenient,
to the point where a weekend in Shanghai might cost less than a few days in
Kending.</P>
      <P>A five-day tour from Taiwan to Hangzhou in China's Zhejiang province, for
instance, can cost as little as NT$5,000 (US$155), less than a two-day trip from
other parts of Taiwan to Kending -- one of the country's most popular tourism
destinations.</P>
      <P>Many small hotels and homestays are now trying to fight back, offering 20
percent discounts on accommodation.</P>
      <P>They also remain concerned  that if the sluggish economic environment persists,
they will also fare poorly during the coming Lunar New Year holiday -- one of
the peak periods for domestic travel when hotels can usually charge premiums for
rooms.</P>
      <P>The Lunar New Year's Day falls on Jan. 26, 2009.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei nightlife scene remains lively despite economic downturn</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Most of Taiwan's economy is facing a serious revenue slump, but Taipei's
nightlife scene has apparently remained as popular and lively as ever, according
to the management of various nightclubs in the city.</P>
      <P>We have not seen the economic downturn have an impact on our business as it has
others, " remarked Moon Feng, supervisor of the Department of Marketing and
Promotion of Room 18, one of the hottest places in Taipei for night-fun seekers.</P>
      <P>She told the Central News Agency that the club's number of patrons have remained
on an equal footing with turnout in past years, averaging 1,500 every open
night.</P>
      <P>Other indicators  such as frequency of visits and nightly expenditures on food
and drink have also stayed steady, she said, and Christmas may be even stronger
than in years past.</P>
      <P>With the pub's 25 private rooms completely booked and various promotions being
offered to coincide with the holiday theme, we are confident that more than
2,000 people will attend our event, Feng said.</P>
      <P>People probably want even more to seize the opportunity of a holiday to have fun
and be merry when the economy is not doing so well,she suggested, explaining her
club's success.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Joanna Su, marketing manager of LOOP Production, which ownsLuxy,
another club worshiped by party animals in downtown Taipei, said her club had
also been relatively immune to the impact of the sluggish economy.</P>
      <P>The club's advanced sales for its Christmas Eve festivities have been strong,
she said, with pre-sold tickets to its three ballrooms nearly all gone.</P>
      <P>With free drinks offered to guests before 11 p.m. as well as the planned
appearance of a popular singer on Taiwan's music scene, Su hoped the club's draw
on Wednesday night would also exceed 2,000.</P>
      <P>Taipei-basedPrimotold CNA that not only has the club not suffered from more
thrifty consumer spending behavior as a result of the weak economy, it has
actually thrived.</P>
      <P>According to Primo's project planner, Manson Yu, the club, which caters to
upscale customers such as celebrities and entrepreneurs, saw business double in
the past month compared to February when it opened.</P>
      <P>With privacy a major concern for most of his patrons, Yu suggested thatexquisite
attention to serviceplays a pivotal role in pursuing their trust and gaining
their loyalty.</P>
      <P>For example, each new club employee must sign aprivacy clause" that forbids them
to leak out the identities of club guests. At the same time, Primo has 20
security guards covering an area of less than 660 square meters.</P>
      <P>The club has also cultivated repeat business, Yu said, through its membership
system.</P>
      <P>"We know what a customer's favorite drink is, and we will also offer to throw
him or her a birthday party when that special day arrives,Yu said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has entered a period of low interest rates, low wages and low confidence,
a job market expert warned Monday.</P>
      <P>Ryan Wu, chief operating officer of Internet-based 1111 Job Bank, said the
November jobless figures released by the Directorate-General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics earlier Monday might have underestimated the
seriousness of Taiwan's unemployment problem because the "hidden unemployed"
were not reflected in the statistics.</P>
      <P>DGBAS figures  showed that 507,700  people in Taiwan were unemployed in
November, representing a rise of 31,000 people, or 4.64 percent, over October --
the highest single-month increase ever recorded.</P>
      <P>The unemployed total included 202,000 people who became jobless because their
companies either downsized or ceased operations.</P>
      <P>Wu pointed out that many part-time workers who were paid less than NT$10,000 per
month -- lower than the lowest unemployment benefit of NT$10,368 paid by the
Bureau of Labor Insurance -- were not counted as unemployed.</P>
      <P>He said the official jobless figures might have underestimated Taiwan's
unemployment situation because underemployed  part-time workers constituted a
main part of the hidden unemployed group.</P>
      <P>Wu also said that a domino effect has already appeared in Taiwan, with many
companies reducing their workforces, further aggravating the unemployment
situation.</P>

      <P>The administration of President Ma Ying-jeou has earned the trust of many of
Taiwan's citizens, who believe it will reduce official corruption and improve
the level of public  sector  integrity  in  the  future,  a  Transparency
International-Taiwan survey has found.</P>
      <P>According to the results of the group's 2008 survey on clean governance,
released by the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) Monday, more than 58 percent of
respondents had faith the government would be less corrupt in the coming years.</P>
      <P>The results marked the first time that more than half of the respondents to the
annual survey voiced confidence in the ability of Taiwan's government to deal
with corruption in the public sector.</P>
      <P>MOJ officials speculated that the result may have been caused by the people's
wish for the new government to be different from the previous administration led
by former President Chen Shui-bian, who has been indicted on embezzlement and
money laundering charges.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by Transparency International-Taiwan July 4-8, with
randomly chosen adults aged above 20 being interviewed by telephone.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,626 valid samples were collected, and the survey had a margin of
error of plus/minus 2.4 percentage points.</P>
      <P>Under a 1-10 rating system for the degree of incorruptibility of public
servants, with 10 representing the best score, civil servants and elected
officials scored an average of 5 this year, slightly higher than the 4.88
recorded at the same time last year.</P>
      <P>The public servants responsible for river gravel management were seen as the
least trustworthy, receiving the lowest score of 3.7 points, trailing just
behind officials in charge of government procurement and public construction
projects, who received an average score of 3.98.</P>
      <P>Legislators finished third from the bottom with a score of 4.04, the survey
found.</P>
      <P>Local elected officials all received low scores, with county and city councilors
averaging 4.15, and elected township representatives averaging 4.36.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, medical personnel at public hospitals received the
highest score of 6.08, followed by common public servants at 5.8, and government
employees in charge of land administration at 5.75.</P>
      <P>With no category of government personnel scoring a 7 or better, TI-Taiwan
suggested that the government  expand anti-corruption efforts to further gain
the people's trust.</P>
      <P>The organization also urged that public officials be made subject to a proposed
law that would make it illegal for officials to have assets from sources they
cannot identify.</P>
      <P>The survey results will be presented to the central government's anti-corruption
commission, the MOJ said.</P>

      <P>More workers in Taiwan -- especially those in the photonics, semiconductor and
computer manufacturing industries -- were forced by their employers to take
unpaid leave in November, according to official statistics released Monday.</P>
      <P>The statistics, compiled by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics, showed that as a result of the unpaid leave practice, 741,000 people
worked less than 35 hours per week in November, an increase of 205,000 over
October's total of 536,000.</P>
      <P>DGBAS official Huang Chien-chung said the mandatory unpaid leave plans being
implemented by the high-tech sector are expected to increase in intensity and
lead to a further decline in the nation's already negative growth in wages.</P>
      <P>Previous statistics from the DGBAS showed that Taiwan recorded nominal wage
growth of minus 0.27 in October -- the third negative monthly growth rate in a
row.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, labor rights groups expressed concern that the unpaid leave practice
might affect workers' future pensions and other benefits. They called on the
Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) to intervene on behalf of the
employed.</P>
      <P>CLA officials explained that irrespective of how long an unpaid leave may be,
the monthly wage should not be lower than the minimum NT$17,280 required by law.</P>
      <P>They added that the unpaid leave practice should not affect any severance
payments and pension plans.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Prosecutors will again appeal ex-president's release</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Prosecutors will again appeal the Taipei District Court's decision to release
former President Chen Shui-bian on his own recognizance, a Supreme Prosecutors
Office (SPO) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Yun-nan,  director of the SPO's Special Investigation Division (SID) , said
that SID prosecutors decided to renew their request for Chen's detention after
studying the Dec. 18 Taiwan District Court ruling that upheld its earlier
decision to free Chen without bail.</P>
      <P>"Prosecutors have come to such a decision as they think judges have not
presented sufficent and fully convincing reasons to back up their ruling," Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Because the SID team handling the corruption and money laundering case against
the ex-president did not receive the court verdict until Monday evening, team
members have yet to draft their petition, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He indicated, however, that prosecutors will definitely file their appeal before
the deadline in one week's time.</P>
      <P>As to whether prosecutors will ask the high court to hand down a ruling on their
request instead of sending the case back to the district court for a new
hearing, Chen said the SID team will study the issue and address it in detail in
the petition.</P>
      <P>Asked whether prosecutors are likely to request that the former president be
detained on suspicions of his involvement in other criminal cases, Chen said the
SID team has no such plans at the moment.</P>
      <P>Last Thursday, the district court rejected the request to detain the former
president on the grounds that prosecutors failed to prove that Chen Shui-bian
might flee Taiwan, intimidate witnesses or co-defendants into going back on
their previous testimony, or collude with others to tamper with evidence.</P>
      <P>It was the district court's second ruling in six days on the issue.</P>
      <P>The district court handed down the ruling after the Taiwan High Court Wednesday
upheld an appeal by prosecutors asking for the case to be reheard.</P>
      <P>In its appeal to the Taiwan High Court Dec. 16, the prosecutors also noted that
they would soon begin to investigate several other corruption cases allegedly
involving Chen and his wife.</P>
      <P>If Chen is allowed to remain free, the prosecutors argued, some of the
witnesses, including three of his former close aides, might not dare to tell the
truth.</P>
      <P>In its earlier ruling Dec. 13, the court ordered that Chen, who was detained
Nov. 12, be released without bail following his indictment, along with 13 other
people, on charges of embezzlement, corruption and money laundering.</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife are accused of siphoning off NT$104 million (US$3.12 million)
from a special Presidential Office discretionary fund during his presidency from
2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>They are also charged with accepting bribes worth NT$100 million and NT$200
million in connection with a land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million
in kickbacks to help a contractor win the tender for a government construction
project, according to the indictment.</P>

      <P>Around 22 percent of Taiwan's office workers have part time jobs, with 56
percent of them being driven to do such jobs because of the economic downturn,
according to results of a poll released Monday.</P>
      <P>Of the part-time job holders, 12.28 percent also have full-time jobs in addition
to their part-time work; while 9.64 percent have no other jobs, the poll
conducted by the 1111 job bank found.</P>
      <P>The study also showed that office workers and others with temporary jobs can
earn an extra NT$16,021 (US$327) per month on average from their part-time
employment.</P>
      <P>According to the job bank, an increasing number of people are starting small
businesses, returning to school for skills training or working part-time because
they are having problems finding full-time work.</P>
      <P>A higher percentage of workers of both genders aged over 41 years have part-time
jobs, compared to their counterparts aged below 40 -- reflecting a rising
jobless rate among middle-aged office workers, a job bank executive said.</P>
      <P>In addition, he pointed out, a larger percentage of women than men have
temporary work as more and more housewives hope to share their family's
financial burden amid growing financial difficulties in the current economic
recession.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the number of job application forms filled out on the job bank's
website increased by 43.39 percent in November, compared to the same month last
year.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the Cabinet-level Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) , in the first three quarters of this
year, Taiwanese workers' permanent salaries rose by 1.02 percent year-on-year on
average -- the lowest level in three years.</P>
      <P>Their real income recorded a negative 2.95 percent growth -- the largest
decrease since 1980, after taking into consideration the consumer price index,
the DGBAS statistics showed.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the number of Taiwan's jobless workers would further rise
to around 500,000 in November, affecting more than 1 million people, including
the jobless person and his or her family members. This is up from 476,000
unemployed people in October, which recorded a jobless rate of 4.37 percent.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's jobless rate stood at 3.84 percent in May, according to DGBAS
statistics.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that close to 47 percent of the office workers surveyed do
not moonlight because they have not found suitable part-time jobs, while some 33
percent cited a lack of time or their irregular work schedule as the reasons why
they do not hold part-time jobs.</P>
      <P>About 16 percent of the survey respondents voiced concern over their heavy
workload, the questionnaire discovered.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 10 local garment stores have suffered combined losses of NT$50 million
(US$1.51 million) as a result of remittance fraud committed by a Chinese
brokerage firm known to them as Guangda Co., the Criminal Investigation Bureau
(CIB) said in a news release Monday.</P>
      <P>The stores, as well as various other Taiwanese importers, are vulnerable to this
type of remittance fraud due to the lack of direct remittance services between
Taiwan and China, CIB officials noted.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, many store owners have expressed strong hopes that
with the Dec. 15 implementation of direct transport and postal links between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait, it is now time to consider direct remittance
services so that importers can avoid being exploited  by middlemen  or becoming
targets for fraudsters.</P>
      <P>A store on the renowned Wufenpu business circle in Taipei's Sungshan district,
owned by a woman identified by her surname Wang, has been importing garments
from China for over 10 years. Wang recently began to use Guangda Co. as her
remittance broker, thinking she would be able to make savings on service
charges.</P>
      <P>She received a phone call one day from a person claiming to be Guangda's
accountant, who asked her to wire her payment to a different  bank account.
After remitting NT$1 million to the designated account, the company of course
vanished.</P>
      <P>The CIB said a garment store in Taichung County lost NT$400,000 in a similar
manner, while another in Taichung City lost NT$460,000.</P>
      <P>Further investigation by the CIB led to the discovery that Guangda Co. staff
called more than 10 garment stores in Taiwan at about the same time in early
December, asking them to wire their payments into a designated bank account.</P>
      <P>After raking some NT$50 million from the Taiwanese buyers, Guangda Co. dropped
under the radar, taking its clients' money with it, according to the CIB.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Employers and workers ask suspension of labor premium rate increase</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 22 (CNA)
12/22/08  20:03:07

    <TEXT>
      <P>Representatives of employers and workers on Monday expressed hopes that a
planned increase in labor insurance premium rate, which is scheduled to go into
effect next year, can be postponed for one year, in order to avoid additional
pressure on management and employees under the current economic downturn.</P>
      <P>The representatives expressed their opinions at a public hearing held in the
Legislative Yuan. In attendance were legislators, representatives of workers'
unions and employers from around the island, as well as officials from the
Council of Labor Affairs.</P>
      <P>We suggested that the government postpone the implementation of the new premium
rate, or prepare a special budget to help employers and workers afford the
increase in premiums, said Lu Fu-tsai, a member of the Taipei-based Chinese
National Association of Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>The CLA should postpone the insurance premium increase for one year in order not
to create another financial burden for both laborers and employers, said Huang
Ying-hua, a representative of a workers' union from Taoyuan County in northern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to an amendment to the Labor Insurance Act approved in July, the
premium rate is supposed to be raised from the current 6.5 percent to 7.5
percent from January 1 next year.</P>
      <P>Pan Shih-wei, CLA deputy minister, told the employers and employees'
representatives that changing the labor insurance premium rate is a question of
amending the act, adding that the CLA supported all that is beneficial to
workers.</P>
      <P>Pan, however, did not say what the CLA would do to address the groups' demand.</P>
      <P>Employers and workers, meanwhile, disagreed on whether Taiwan should allow more
foreign workers or reduce the number of such workers during these economic
times.</P>
      <P>Huang stressed that the government should suspend introduction of foreign
workers in the manufacturing and construction industries and that enterprises
should not renew contracts with foreign workers already working in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also noted that a fund must be set up immediately to help laborers file
lawsuits against employers and protect their rights.</P>
      <P>Pan reiterated that the CLA vowed to undertake strict checks on the proportion
of national workers and foreign workers in factories and will not allow
employers to hire more foreign workers without legitimate reasons.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, when an enterprise plans to lay off Taiwanese workers, the
employer should ask if these workers are willing to undertake foreign
workersjob, which is usually more arduous.</P>
      <P>If Taiwanese workers agree,  the CLA plans to cancel the enterprises quota of
foreign workers, so as to protect local workersright to work.</P>
      <P>A plan regarding imposing a stricter policy on hiring foreign workers will be
presented soon, Pan added.</P>
      <P>Ho Yu,  who represents the Chinese National Federation of Industries, said
however that quotas of foreign workers should not be canceled, especially for
the so-called "3K" industries, which means "dirty,  dangerous  and  difficult",
in case  of an economic revitalization in the future.</P>
      <P>The Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics under the Executive
Yuan reported Monday that the latest unemployment rate has soared to 4.64
percent in November, an increase of 0.27 percent over October.</P>
      <P>The total number of jobless people increased to 507,000.</P>
      <P>The average unemployment rate from January to November this year is 4.06
percent, 0.14 percent higher compared to the same period last year, according to
the agency.</P>

      <P>Taiwan had 507,000 jobless in November, with 202,000 of them having lost their
jobs through downsizing or company closures, a six-year high for the month,
according to DGBAS official Huang Jiann-jong.</P>
      <P>Particularly worrisome, Huang said, is that the number of laid-off workers
increased by 71,000 -- more than a third of the existing total -- during the
past three months.</P>
      <P>In addition, the number of jobless in the 45 to 64 age bracket averaged 86,000
from January to November, 14.94 percent higher than for the same period last
year. That represented the highest growth rate of unemployed among all age
brackets.</P>
      <P>Huang suggested that the sharp rise in jobless middle-aged workers required
attention, as the trend could impact families and society as a whole.</P>
      <P>Also worth noting, Huang said, is that the average unemployment rate during
January and November for workers with a bachelor's degree or higher reached 4.73
percent, the highest number among all educational levels.</P>
      <P>With the inclusion of November's numbers, unemployment in the first 11 months of
the year averaged 4.06 percent, or 0.14 percentage points higher than the same
period last year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opening of daily nonstop charter flights between Taiwan and China has
effectively cut cross-Taiwan Strait travel times and costs, but it may also be
luring away local residents from traveling within the country, business sources
said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to industry insiders, many small hotels and inns in the Kending
National Park area in southern Taiwan's Hengchun Peninsula are facing sluggish
advanced bookings -- the worst in history.</P>
      <P>Rooms at local hotels were almost fully booked as the new year approached last
year, sources said, and hotel operators had hoped that the upcoming four-day
extended holiday from Jan. 1 to Jan. 4 would generate even stronger momentum for
their businesses.</P>
      <P>But those hopes have yet to be realized.</P>
      <P>Chung Tien-hui, who runs an inn in Kending targeting retail clients, said
potential occupancy rates for the coming holiday at most of the hotels and bed
and breakfast inns in the area remain "low" -- about 20 percent or 30 percent --
even though New Year's Day is only nine days away.</P>
      <P>Chung acknowledged that the recession has played a role in the area's poor
advance bookings but also suggested that the nonstop daily charters to China
inaugurated Dec. 15 deserved a share of the blame.</P>
      <P>The new service has made China-bound travel even more affordable and convenient,
to the point where a weekend in Shanghai might cost less than a few days in
Kending.</P>
      <P>A five-day tour from Taiwan to Hangzhou in China's Zhejiang province, for
instance, can cost as little as NT$5,000 (US$155), less than a two-day trip from
other parts of Taiwan to Kending -- one of the country's most popular tourism
destinations.</P>
      <P>Many small hotels and homestays are now trying to fight back, offering 20
percent discounts on accommodation.</P>
      <P>They also remain concerned  that if the sluggish economic environment persists,
they will also fare poorly during the coming Lunar New Year holiday -- one of
the peak periods for domestic travel when hotels can usually charge premiums for
rooms.</P>
      <P>The Lunar New Year's Day falls on Jan. 26, 2009.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Most of Taiwan's economy is facing a serious revenue slump, but Taipei's
nightlife scene has apparently remained as popular and lively as ever, according
to the management of various nightclubs in the city.</P>
      <P>We have not seen the economic downturn have an impact on our business as it has
others, " remarked Moon Feng, supervisor of the Department of Marketing and
Promotion of Room 18, one of the hottest places in Taipei for night-fun seekers.</P>
      <P>She told the Central News Agency that the club's number of patrons have remained
on an equal footing with turnout in past years, averaging 1,500 every open
night.</P>
      <P>Other indicators  such as frequency of visits and nightly expenditures on food
and drink have also stayed steady, she said, and Christmas may be even stronger
than in years past.</P>
      <P>With the pub's 25 private rooms completely booked and various promotions being
offered to coincide with the holiday theme, we are confident that more than
2,000 people will attend our event, Feng said.</P>
      <P>People probably want even more to seize the opportunity of a holiday to have fun
and be merry when the economy is not doing so well,she suggested, explaining her
club's success.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Joanna Su, marketing manager of LOOP Production, which ownsLuxy,
another club worshiped by party animals in downtown Taipei, said her club had
also been relatively immune to the impact of the sluggish economy.</P>
      <P>The club's advanced sales for its Christmas Eve festivities have been strong,
she said, with pre-sold tickets to its three ballrooms nearly all gone.</P>
      <P>With free drinks offered to guests before 11 p.m. as well as the planned
appearance of a popular singer on Taiwan's music scene, Su hoped the club's draw
on Wednesday night would also exceed 2,000.</P>
      <P>Taipei-basedPrimotold CNA that not only has the club not suffered from more
thrifty consumer spending behavior as a result of the weak economy, it has
actually thrived.</P>
      <P>According to Primo's project planner, Manson Yu, the club, which caters to
upscale customers such as celebrities and entrepreneurs, saw business double in
the past month compared to February when it opened.</P>
      <P>With privacy a major concern for most of his patrons, Yu suggested thatexquisite
attention to serviceplays a pivotal role in pursuing their trust and gaining
their loyalty.</P>
      <P>For example, each new club employee must sign aprivacy clause" that forbids them
to leak out the identities of club guests. At the same time, Primo has 20
security guards covering an area of less than 660 square meters.</P>
      <P>The club has also cultivated repeat business, Yu said, through its membership
system.</P>
      <P>"We know what a customer's favorite drink is, and we will also offer to throw
him or her a birthday party when that special day arrives,Yu said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has entered a period of low interest rates, low wages and low confidence,
a job market expert warned Monday.</P>
      <P>Ryan Wu, chief operating officer of Internet-based 1111 Job Bank, said the
November jobless figures released by the Directorate-General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics earlier Monday might have underestimated the
seriousness of Taiwan's unemployment problem because the "hidden unemployed"
were not reflected in the statistics.</P>
      <P>DGBAS figures  showed that 507,700  people in Taiwan were unemployed in
November, representing a rise of 31,000 people, or 4.64 percent, over October --
the highest single-month increase ever recorded.</P>
      <P>The unemployed total included 202,000 people who became jobless because their
companies either downsized or ceased operations.</P>
      <P>Wu pointed out that many part-time workers who were paid less than NT$10,000 per
month -- lower than the lowest unemployment benefit of NT$10,368 paid by the
Bureau of Labor Insurance -- were not counted as unemployed.</P>
      <P>He said the official jobless figures might have underestimated Taiwan's
unemployment situation because underemployed  part-time workers constituted a
main part of the hidden unemployed group.</P>
      <P>Wu also said that a domino effect has already appeared in Taiwan, with many
companies reducing their workforces, further aggravating the unemployment
situation.</P>

      <P>The administration of President Ma Ying-jeou has earned the trust of many of
Taiwan's citizens, who believe it will reduce official corruption and improve
the level of public  sector  integrity  in  the  future,  a  Transparency
International-Taiwan survey has found.</P>
      <P>According to the results of the group's 2008 survey on clean governance,
released by the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) Monday, more than 58 percent of
respondents had faith the government would be less corrupt in the coming years.</P>
      <P>The results marked the first time that more than half of the respondents to the
annual survey voiced confidence in the ability of Taiwan's government to deal
with corruption in the public sector.</P>
      <P>MOJ officials speculated that the result may have been caused by the people's
wish for the new government to be different from the previous administration led
by former President Chen Shui-bian, who has been indicted on embezzlement and
money laundering charges.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by Transparency International-Taiwan July 4-8, with
randomly chosen adults aged above 20 being interviewed by telephone.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,626 valid samples were collected, and the survey had a margin of

      <P>The public servants responsible for river gravel management were seen as the

      <P>Legislators finished third from the bottom with a score of 4.04, the survey

      <P>According to the survey, medical personnel at public hospitals received the

      <P>More workers in Taiwan -- especially those in the photonics, semiconductor and
computer manufacturing industries -- were forced by their employers to take
unpaid leave in November, according to official statistics released Monday.</P>
      <P>The statistics, compiled by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics, showed that as a result of the unpaid leave practice, 741,000 people
worked less than 35 hours per week in November, an increase of 205,000 over
October's total of 536,000.</P>
      <P>DGBAS official Huang Chien-chung said the mandatory unpaid leave plans being
implemented by the high-tech sector are expected to increase in intensity and
lead to a further decline in the nation's already negative growth in wages.</P>
      <P>Previous statistics from the DGBAS showed that Taiwan recorded nominal wage
growth of minus 0.27 in October -- the third negative monthly growth rate in a
row.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, labor rights groups expressed concern that the unpaid leave practice
might affect workers' future pensions and other benefits. They called on the
Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) to intervene on behalf of the
employed.</P>
      <P>CLA officials explained that irrespective of how long an unpaid leave may be,
the monthly wage should not be lower than the minimum NT$17,280 required by law.</P>
      <P>They added that the unpaid leave practice should not affect any severance
payments and pension plans.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Prosecutors will again appeal ex-president's release</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Prosecutors will again appeal the Taipei District Court's decision to release
former President Chen Shui-bian on his own recognizance, a Supreme Prosecutors
Office (SPO) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Yun-nan,  director of the SPO's Special Investigation Division (SID) , said
that SID prosecutors decided to renew their request for Chen's detention after
studying the Dec. 18 Taiwan District Court ruling that upheld its earlier
decision to free Chen without bail.</P>
      <P>"Prosecutors have come to such a decision as they think judges have not
presented sufficent and fully convincing reasons to back up their ruling," Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Because the SID team handling the corruption and money laundering case against
the ex-president did not receive the court verdict until Monday evening, team
members have yet to draft their petition, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He indicated, however, that prosecutors will definitely file their appeal before
the deadline in one week's time.</P>
      <P>As to whether prosecutors will ask the high court to hand down a ruling on their
request instead of sending the case back to the district court for a new
hearing, Chen said the SID team will study the issue and address it in detail in
the petition.</P>
      <P>Asked whether prosecutors are likely to request that the former president be
detained on suspicions of his involvement in other criminal cases, Chen said the
SID team has no such plans at the moment.</P>
      <P>Last Thursday, the district court rejected the request to detain the former
president on the grounds that prosecutors failed to prove that Chen Shui-bian
might flee Taiwan, intimidate witnesses or co-defendants into going back on
their previous testimony, or collude with others to tamper with evidence.</P>
      <P>It was the district court's second ruling in six days on the issue.</P>
      <P>The district court handed down the ruling after the Taiwan High Court Wednesday
upheld an appeal by prosecutors asking for the case to be reheard.</P>
      <P>In its appeal to the Taiwan High Court Dec. 16, the prosecutors also noted that
they would soon begin to investigate several other corruption cases allegedly
involving Chen and his wife.</P>
      <P>If Chen is allowed to remain free, the prosecutors argued, some of the
witnesses, including three of his former close aides, might not dare to tell the
truth.</P>
      <P>In its earlier ruling Dec. 13, the court ordered that Chen, who was detained
Nov. 12, be released without bail following his indictment, along with 13 other
people, on charges of embezzlement, corruption and money laundering.</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife are accused of siphoning off NT$104 million (US$3.12 million)
from a special Presidential Office discretionary fund during his presidency from
2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>They are also charged with accepting bribes worth NT$100 million and NT$200
million in connection with a land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million
in kickbacks to help a contractor win the tender for a government construction
project, according to the indictment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Unpaid leave affects 741,000 workers in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

      <P>More workers in Taiwan -- especially those in the photonics, semiconductor and
computer manufacturing industries -- were forced by their employers to take
unpaid leave in November, according to official statistics released Monday.</P>
      <P>The statistics, compiled by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics, showed that as a result of the unpaid leave practice, 741,000 people
worked less than 35 hours per week in November, an increase of 205,000 over
October's total of 536,000.</P>
      <P>DGBAS official Huang Chien-chung said the mandatory unpaid leave plans being
implemented by the high-tech sector are expected to increase in intensity and
lead to a further decline in the nation's already negative growth in wages.</P>
      <P>Previous statistics from the DGBAS showed that Taiwan recorded nominal wage
growth of minus 0.27 in October -- the third negative monthly growth rate in a
row.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, labor rights groups expressed concern that the unpaid leave practice
might affect workers' future pensions and other benefits. They called on the
Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) to intervene on behalf of the
employed.</P>
      <P>CLA officials explained that irrespective of how long an unpaid leave may be,
the monthly wage should not be lower than the minimum NT$17,280 required by law.</P>
      <P>They added that the unpaid leave practice should not affect any severance
payments and pension plans.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Prosecutors will again appeal ex-president's release</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  22 (CNA)
12/23/08  10:34:34

    <TEXT>
      <P>Prosecutors will again appeal the Taipei District Court's decision to release
former President Chen Shui-bian on his own recognizance, a Supreme Prosecutors
Office (SPO) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Yun-nan,  director of the SPO's Special Investigation Division (SID) , said
that SID prosecutors decided to renew their request for Chen's detention after
studying the Dec. 18 Taiwan District Court ruling that upheld its earlier
decision to free Chen without bail.</P>
      <P>"Prosecutors have come to such a decision as they think judges have not
presented sufficent and fully convincing reasons to back up their ruling," Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Because the SID team handling the corruption and money laundering case against
the ex-president did not receive the court verdict until Monday evening, team
members have yet to draft their petition, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He indicated, however, that prosecutors will definitely file their appeal before
the deadline in one week's time.</P>
      <P>As to whether prosecutors will ask the high court to hand down a ruling on their
request instead of sending the case back to the district court for a new
hearing, Chen said the SID team will study the issue and address it in detail in
the petition.</P>
      <P>Asked whether prosecutors are likely to request that the former president be
detained on suspicions of his involvement in other criminal cases, Chen said the
SID team has no such plans at the moment.</P>
      <P>Last Thursday, the district court rejected the request to detain the former
president on the grounds that prosecutors failed to prove that Chen Shui-bian
might flee Taiwan, intimidate witnesses or co-defendants into going back on
their previous testimony, or collude with others to tamper with evidence.</P>
      <P>It was the district court's second ruling in six days on the issue.</P>
      <P>The district court handed down the ruling after the Taiwan High Court Wednesday
upheld an appeal by prosecutors asking for the case to be reheard.</P>
      <P>In its appeal to the Taiwan High Court Dec. 16, the prosecutors also noted that
they would soon begin to investigate several other corruption cases allegedly
involving Chen and his wife.</P>
      <P>If Chen is allowed to remain free, the prosecutors argued, some of the
witnesses, including three of his former close aides, might not dare to tell the
truth.</P>
      <P>In its earlier ruling Dec. 13, the court ordered that Chen, who was detained
Nov. 12, be released without bail following his indictment, along with 13 other
people, on charges of embezzlement, corruption and money laundering.</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife are accused of siphoning off NT$104 million (US$3.12 million)
from a special Presidential Office discretionary fund during his presidency from
2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>They are also charged with accepting bribes worth NT$100 million and NT$200
million in connection with a land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million
in kickbacks to help a contractor win the tender for a government construction
project, according to the indictment.</P>

      <P>The "This Year in Baseball Awards" lack the prestige of their official
counterparts like the Cy Young and Most Valuable Player awards that define
excellence in U.S Major League Baseball.</P>
      <P>Chosen by fans rather than the Baseball Writers' Association of America, they
amount to a post-season popularity contest that keep people interested in the
game.</P>
      <P>Yet for Taiwan's Kuo Hong-chih, who last week won the This Year in Baseball
Award for best setup man, simply appearing in enough games at the major league
level to be even considered for the honor is nothing short of amazing and a
testament to Kuo's persistence.</P>
      <P>Signed by the Los Angeles Dodgers for US$1.25 million as a teenager in 1999, he
blew out his elbow in his first professional game in 2000 and has faced
considerable roadblocks since.</P>
      <P>He missed the entire 2003 and 2004 season from his second Tommy John surgery and
has been unable to remain healthy at the major league level since he first
pitched for the major league club in 2005.</P>
      <P>As recently as 2007, Kuo had rotator cuff problems and elbow surgery, leaving
his career in jeopardy, according to MLB.com.</P>
      <P>Long nurtured as a starter by the Dodgers, the club has been reluctant to use
him as a reliever because it felt his surgically repaired left arm was not
suited to the quick warm-up routines of pitchers coming out of the bullpen.</P>
      <P>But after three poor starts to start the 2008 season, in which he yielded six
earned runs in 10 2/3 innings, Kuo was moved to the bullpen.</P>
      <P>He began as an uncelebrated middle reliever, but claimed the setup role midway
through the season when closer Takashi Saito was injured in July and was nearly
unhittable after that.</P>
      <P>Though Kuo still showed signs of physical frailty, sitting out most of September
with a sore biceps,  he nonetheless posted impressive numbers.</P>
      <P>He went 5-2 with a 1.69 ERA in relief, the best in the league, and struck out 86
in 69 1/3 innings of work. Most impressive was the 42 games he pitched in
(including the three starts), nearly doubling his 45 appearances in his first
three major league seasons.</P>
      <P>Those numbers, and the legions of Taiwanese fans who closely follow U.S.
baseball, helped him garner 30.3 percent of the 1.2 million votes cast to win
the setup man award, beating out Grant Balfour (19.2 percent) of the Tampa Bay
Rays and Carlos Marmol (17.2 percent) of the Chicago Cubs.</P>
      <P>With Saito not tendered a contract for the 2009 season, Kuo will compete with
Jonathan Broxton for the Dodgers' closer role, a much different role than he may
have envisioned years ago but now accepts.</P>
      <P>"I think I'm better suited to being a reliever because I don't have a big
assortment of pitches," Kuo told local media. "But I may need another two to
three years to be ready as a closer."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Barack Obama administration is not likely to pick a fight with China by
establishing closer formal commercial ties with Taiwan, given Washington's many
common interests with Beijing, a former assistant United States trade
representative said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Charles Freeman, an expert on U.S-China relations, said signing a U.S.-Taiwan
Free Trade Agreement or U.S.  support of Taiwan's participation in the P4 group
of countries -- consisting of New Zealand, Singapore, Chile, and Brunei -- could
easily "upset China."</P>
      <P>"Any move by the U.S to support Taiwan's participation in organizations such as
the P4 will require Beijing's approval, " Freeman  said  in  Washington  during
a videoconference  with representatives of Taiwan's Office of Trade Negotiations
to discuss the new U.S. administration's approach to trade, China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Freeman said, however,  that the Obama administration will continue to urge
China to be a responsible stakeholder and will also try to pressure it into
expanding domestic consumption in its export-driven economy and appreciating its
currency.</P>
      <P>Noting that Obama as a senator supported legislation to name China  as  a
currency  manipulator,  Freeman  said  Treasury Secretary-designate Timothy
Geither, who speaks Cantonese and lived in China where his father worked on aid
projects, will be in charge of continuing the Strategic Economic Dialogue (SED)
and monitoring the currency manipulation issue.</P>
      <P>"It is very likely that Geithner will work harder than (U.S. Treasury Secretary)
Henry Paulson to get the EU, Japan and others to work with the U.S. in the
International Monetary Fund and other multilateral settings against China's
currency interventions, " Freeman said.</P>
      <P>Asked about the Obama administrations's action plan for a US-P4 agreement,
Freeman said there will not be much political cost for the USTR negotiators to
play an active role in the talks, as the agreement is still being negotiated.</P>
      <P>"Indeed there may be some political support because the P4 promises to give the
U.S additional opportunities in markets which China has increasingly dominated,"
Freeman noted, adding that markets in the Asia-Pacific region have been growing
on their own and therefore deserved the attention of U.S trade policy.</P>
      <P>Freeman currently holds the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Zoo hopes to use panda fever to promote wildlife preservation goals</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The arrival of giant pandas in Taiwan has triggered debate on the legitimacy of
exchanging endangered species between countries but the director of the Taipei
City Zoo said international exchanges were necessary to sustain the existence of
endangered species.</P>
      <P>To preserve a diversity of life forms, efforts must be made to educate the
public that a species is on the brink of extinction and inspire people to
protect and take care of species that share the planet with humans, Jason Yeh
contended.</P>
      <P>The zoo manager acknowledged that in the field of biological conservation, the
so-called "flagship species" such as the giant panda not only help generate
long-term benefits for the endangered species itself but also raise public
awareness of the need to protect all animals facing extinction.</P>
      <P>By guiding people to love and care for pandas, people may begin caring for other
species and pay attention to the deterioration of the animals' natural habitats,
which are being destroyed by human acivity.</P>
      <P>"This is the most important task" of the zoo in putting an animal on public
display, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Since China announced in 2005 it would offer a pair of giant pandas to Taiwan as
a gift of good will and friendship, the Taipei City Zoo has been planning and
building a modern panda house that it hopes will reflect the zoo's role in
educating the public and biological and ecological conservation.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that since 2005, the zoo has sent 17 veterinarians and animal keepers
to Beijing, Xian, Shanghai and Hong Kong as well as San Diego and Washington in
the United States, and Chiang Mai in Thailand to see how other captive
facilities have managed pandas.</P>
      <P>They have also spent time at the giant panda habitat in the Wolong Nature
Reserve in Sichuan, southwestern China, to gain knowledge and skills in breeding
and attending the shy and sensitive animals.</P>
      <P>To provide a living environment most suitable for pandas, Taipei City Zoo
experts and staff have also thoroughly researched the "sunglasses-wearing"
animal, including where they live, what they eat, how they breed and raise their
offspring, how to acquire food for the animal, and managing breeding, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the zoo has invited domestic and foreign experts in biological,
veterinary and livestock sciences to join a special team responsible for taking
care of the new tenants during their permanent stay in Taipei, he added.</P>
      <P>One problem the zoo has prepared for is feeding the pair of celebrities, having
planted a six-hectare bamboo forest that will provide at least five different
kinds of fresh bamboo to the giant pandas.</P>
      <P>In addition, Yeh said, the zoo has begun planting at least 10 different kinds of
bamboo, which will can be harvested in about a year.</P>
      <P>Yeh reiterated that introducing pandas into Taiwan is not to create a circus
show or for commercial gain.</P>
      <P>"All the efforts the zoo has made over the past several years to acquire
knowledge in caring and breeding the nearly-extinct animal reflect its devotion
to wildlife preservation," he said.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Zoo has created a complete databank on its Web site concerning the
giant panda that offers detailed information on the endangered species plight,
including the threats it faces and its vulnerability to climate change, human
hunting and the destruction of its natural habitat.</P>
      <P>The zoo hopes the import of pandas will open the doors for Taiwan to join in
international research and cooperation on all aspects of wildlife conservation,
including ethnic genetics, Yeh said.</P>

      <P>III Acting President Ke Jyh-sheng noted that the center's priority is to help
domestic IT manufacturers  produce Moblin 2.0-compatible laptops, nettops, and
other mobile internet devices.</P>
      <P>Moblin, an open-source project led by Intel, aims to develop a Linux-based
software platform for mobile internet devices and other new categories of

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hundreds of workers from around Taiwan gathered Tuesday outside the Council of
Labor Affairs (CLA) building, demanding that the agency safeguard laborers'
right to work by investigating illegal unpaid leave practices and tightening
foreign worker policies.</P>
      <P>Although Tuesday was a work day, many of the protesters from Taipei, Taoyuan,
and Hsinchu in northern Taiwan and Tainan and Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan, who
attended the protest were on unpaid leave.</P>
      <P>"Under the pressure of mass layoffs, the CLA is supposed to be on the side of
workers, but it remains mute, said Mao Chen-fei, president of a labor group from
Taoyuan County, in urging the Cabinet-level agency to take a firmer stance on
the issue.</P>
      <P>The CLA announced last week that all unpaid leave plans must result from
negotiations between employers and employees, and that employers must not pay
workers less than the minimum wage.</P>
      <P>The labor groups estimated, however, that about 500,000 people have been forced
to take unpaid days off without their consent.</P>
      <P>They said that many large-scale enterprises, including Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company and United Microelectronics Corporation, have unilaterally
announced unpaid leave programs and cutbacks in personnel, violating the CLA
guidelines and negatively impacting workers' lives.</P>
      <P>The groups accused Tainan City-based Efun Technology Company of having some of
its employees work only one day per week, and not paying them the minimum wage,
while some other workers had their monthly wage reduced by 10 percent.</P>
      <P>The protesters also stressed that unpaid leave must not affect labor insurance,
health insurance and retirement pension payments, which are calculated on the
basis of workersaverage monthly wage.</P>
      <P>The labor groups also wanted the CLA to implement rules barring enterprises from
dismissing workers or forcing workers to take upaid leave unless they were
posting losses, out of fear that some companies  might replace local employees
with cheaper foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>To safeguard their right to work, the protesters demanded that the CLA suspend
the introduction of foreign workers and strengthen checks on labor conditions
and the ratio of domestic to foreign workers at local enterprises.</P>
      <P>A fund used to help workers survive their economic plight, such as loans, should
also be established right away, they added.</P>
      <P>At present, there are around 380,000 foreign workers in Taiwan, mostly from
Southeast Asian countries, working in the construction and manufacturing
industries or as caretakers.</P>
      <P>The angry workers, of all different ages, attempted to break into the CLA
building at 12: 05 p.m. in a bid to get CLA Minister Wang Ju-hsuan to answer
their demands, but they were stopped by police.</P>
      <P>Wang did not respond to the workers' requests. Instead, CLA senior counselor Lin
Jenn-yeu,  reiterated that the government stressed in a press release that
companies were forbidden to give workers on unpaid leave less than the minimum
wage of NT$17,280 (US$523.5).</P>
      <P>He promised that the CLA will also undertake checks on labor conditions to see
if companies are respecting the CLA's guidelines.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that a mechanism will be set up for workers to file complaints
regarding illegal unpaid leave practices.</P>
      <P>As for the introduction of foreign workers, Lin only said that the CLA is
undertaking a stricter policy on foreign workers that it will continue to
review.</P>
      <P>Unsatisfied with Lin's answers, the workers broke several glasses to symbolize
the frailty of their rights to work.</P>
      <P>If the government does not provide satisfactory answers to their demands in the
near future, the labor associations asserted that they will mobilize more
workers to protest in front of the Office of the President before the Chinese
New Year, which falls on January 26 next year.</P>
      <P>Many enterprises have ordered their workers to take unpaid days off recently to
reduce personnel costs. The Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics also reported Monday that 741,000 people worked less than 35 hours
per week in November, affected by unpaid leave shemes.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS reported Monday that unemployment had climbed to 4.64 percent in
November, with around a total of 507,000 jobless people in Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese starter Wang Chien-ming agreed Monday to a one-year US$5 million
contract with the New York Yankees, avoiding another contentious arbitration
hearing.</P>
      <P>Still two seasons away from having the opportunity to declare for free agency,
Wang's return to the Yankees was a foregone conclusion.</P>
      <P>The only question was how much the club was willing to pay him after a season
that ended for the 28-year-old right-hander in mid-June when he injured his
Lisfranc joint and tore a tendon in his right foot running the bases in a game
against the Houston Astros.</P>
      <P>In the end, the Yankees' offer represented a US$1 million raise, and it was
accepted by Wang and his agent to avoid a repeat of the two sides' acrimonious
arbitration hearing held before the 2008 season.</P>
      <P>At the time, the Yankees offered Wang a one-year US$4 million deal, while the
Taiwanese pitcher's agents demanded US$4.6 million.</P>
      <P>Wang was stung by the adversarial nature of the proceedings, in which the club
pointed to the Taiwanese pitcher's failings. In the end, the arbitrator sided
with the Yankees.</P>
      <P>Aborting its youth movement after a disappointing 2008 season, the first in
which the Yankees did not reach the playoffs since 1994, New York has made the
biggest splash in free agency of any team, signing veteran starters C.C.
Sabathia and A.J. Burnett.</P>
      <P>The presence of the two veterans should take some of the pressure off of Wang,
who despite having won 19 games in both 2006 and 2007 seemed uncomfortable in
his role as the ace of the staff.</P>
      <P>Wang went 8-2 in 2008 with a 4.07 ERA prior to being injured.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chinese pandas to meet Taiwanese visitors on Jan. 25</HEADLINE>

      <P>Arriving in Taiwan Tuesday, two Chinese pandas, Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan, will
live under excellent care in their new home at the Taipei Zoo, where they will
formally meet their curious visitors in Taiwan on Jan. 25 - just in time for
Chinese New Year.</P>
      <P>The zoo's new display facility is a three-storey building claiming a "six-star"
rating, which was constructed with a NT$310 million (US$9.37 million)
sponsorship by the Shin Kong Group.</P>
      <P>There is an international conference hall on the top floor and a visitor center
on the second floor.</P>
      <P>At the ground floor of the facility are two air-conditioned showrooms  measuring
245 square meters and 210 square meters, respectively, which are enough to house
two pairs of pandas.</P>
      <P>According to zoo spokesman Chao Ming-chieh, during summer, the temperature of
the showrooms will be maintained at between 18-22 degrees Celsius, with the
humidity kept at 60-70 percent.</P>
      <P>"The giant pandas have originated from a place where the average temperature
records  no higher than 25 degrees Celsius.  The air-conditioning will help
prevent an uncomfortable situation such as panting during summer time," Chao
said.</P>
      <P>During winter time, the rooms will be left naturally ventilated, he said.</P>
      <P>The pandas' new home will also include an outdoor display area simulating the
pandas' natural habitat. It is formed by a wide grassy ground, tall trees, rocks
and a waterfall to provide the animals with a place for various activities.</P>
      <P>A store room is set aside especially to deposit fresh bamboos -- the main food
of the pandas. It is spacious enough to keep 560 kilograms of the plants to meet
one week's demand by the animals. The room's temperature will be maintained at
4-7 degree Celsius and installed with a water spray system to keep the bamboos
fresh.</P>
      <P>A separate room is designed for the preparation of other supplementary food,
such as corn and bamboo cakes, fruit and vegetables.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, there is a den designed as a place for mating, delivery or nursing.</P>
      <P>The biggest expectation of the pandas is that they will reproduce in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>To ensure successful breeding of the pandas in Taiwan, Tuan Tuan was matched
with Yuan Yuan through DNA analysis to determine they are not close to each
other genetically.</P>
      <P>Tuan Tuan the male panda was born Sept. 1, 2004 to father Ling Ling and mother
Hua Mei, and was registered number 588 worldwide.</P>
      <P>Yuan Yuan the female panda was born Aug. 30, 2004 was born to father Lin Lin and
mother Lei Lei, and registered number 587.</P>
      <P>According to zoologists, giant pandas living in the wild usually reach sexual
maturity between the ages of six and seven, while those in captivity can reach
sexual maturity two to three years earlier because they are provided with better
nutrition.</P>
      <P>Yuan Yuan began to show signs of puberty in the spring this year, and Tuan Tuan
is expected to become sexually mature by 2010, Taipei Zoo officials said.</P>
      <P>The mating season of giant pandas runs between March and May, but the estrous
cycle of the female panda lasts only three days. The fact that the male panda's
penis is very short further increases the difficulty of mating.</P>
      <P>Chao said the zoo will monitor the hormonal changes of the pandas through urine
tests and observe other signs, such as their scream, behavior and appetite to
judge if they are ready for mating.</P>
      <P>The zoo is also planning to show Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan videos of mating pandas
to try to arouse their interest in mating.</P>
      <P>If a natural fertilization is unsuccessful, the zoo will consider artificial
insemination, Chao said.</P>
      <P>In the future, when the children of Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan reach productive
age, they will not mate with each other but will be matched with other pandas in
China, said Taipei Zoo Director Jason Yeh.</P>
      <P>Setting a precedent, the zoo will assign keepers to take care of the pair on a
rotational basis to ensure their safety and prepare for any emergencies, Yeh
said.</P>
      <P>The zoo estimated that the care of the pair of pandas will cost NT$38 million
per year, including NT$1.02 million on the purchase of fresh bamboos as food for
the animals.</P>
      <P>In addition to individual and corporate sponsorship, the sales of related theme
products will also provide a source of funding, Yeh said.</P>

      <P>Din Tai Fung, a world famous dumpling house based in Taipei, reported Monday
that its profits so far this year have declined by almost 30 percent compared
with the same period last year and that it has suspended its plans to open
branches in the Philippines and Thailand, as a result of the economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Din Tai Fing, a innocuous-looking shop located in Taipei City's Yungkang
commercial circle,  specializes in small steamed pork dumplings, called
"hsiaolungpao," but its chicken soup and vegetable and meat dumplings are also
favorites among visitors from all over the world.</P>
      <P>The restaurant not only attracts many international tourists every year eager to
sample its "hsialungpao, " it is also a popular gourmet eatery among numerous
local people.</P>
      <P>It is particularly popular among Japanese tourists, including celebrities. When
Japanese pop singer Ayumi Hamasaki was in Taiwan to hold a concert at Taipei
Arena last year, she invited one of the restaurant's chefs to make the famous
dumplings on the spot before the start of the show.</P>
      <P>Another Japanese singer Kosuke Atari, who was one of the stars in the Taiwan-
made box office hit Cape No. 7, also talked about his obsession with Din Tai
Fung's dumplings, during a promotional event for the film earlier in the year.</P>
      <P>Din Tai Fung was rated as one of the top 10 gourmet restaurants in the world by
the New York Times in 1993 and has established branches in many foreign
countries.</P>
      <P>It also embarked on a "soft power diplomacy" effort last year, dispatching its
chefs to Britain and France to demonstrate their renowned culinary skills.</P>
      <P>Over the years, the long lines of customers waiting outside the dumpling house
to be served became a common sight, but with the whole world reeling in the
current economic storm, the lines have been getting shorter.</P>
      <P>"The number of customers has actually dwindled," said Hu Huei-yi, chief of the
restaurant's public-relations section. "Usually, the restaurant is full of
customers all the time, but now there's a noticeable difference between peak and
off-peak periods."</P>
      <P>Although Din Tai Fung registered a drop in profits due to the adverse economic
conditions, it is still a profitable enterprise, according to Hu.</P>
      <P>Hu attributed the profit drop mainly to a decline in the number of local
customers, adding that statistics have shown no apparent decrease in the number
of tourists from other countries to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>She said the restaurant's economic resilience is due to its successful
diversification of service, which now includes home delivery and take-out, and
its participation in food fairs and exhibitions.</P>

      <P>The joint forums held by the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and its Chinese
counterpart, the Communist Party of China, will continue in the years ahead
until a peace accord is reached between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, a
whip of the KMT legislative casus said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chang Sho-wen, secretary-general of the KMT caucus, told reporters
that the fourth forum between the KMT and the CPC held in Shanghai Dec. 20-21
was "very constructive," and that there is no need to stop the meetings now.</P>
      <P>"Had it not been for the forums, there would not have been the opening of the
direct transport and postal links between Taiwan and China, and nor would Taiwan
have received the two giant pandas -- Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan -- from China
today," Chang said.</P>
      <P>He commended the contributions made by KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan and KMT
Chair Wu Poh-hsiung in this regard.</P>
      <P>Lien and Wu both attended the fourth KMT-CPC forum in Shanghai, which focused on
cross-strait economic, trade and cultural exchanges.</P>
      <P>Chang said that they deserve credit for working out deals that are beneficial to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The KMT lawmaker also addressed concerns expressed by some critics that the
forums signify party supremacy over the government.</P>
      <P>"The forum is a party-to-party apparatus. There is no question of the
administration keeping a low profile in the contacts," he said, adding that
after the conclusion of the meetings, the KMT always presents a full report to
the president on what was achieved.</P>
      <P>The party-to-party dialogue between the KMT and the CPC began in April 2005 when
then KMT leader Lien made a historic visit to China and met with Chinese
Communist Party Secretary General Hu Jintao -- the first contact between the two
parties in 60 years.</P>
      <P>After the ice-breaking visit, the two parties held a forum on economic and trade
affairs in Beijing in April 2006, a second forum on agricultural cooperation at
Boao in Hainan province in October 2006, and the Cross-Strait Youth Forum in
Beijing in December the same year.</P>

      <P>Manufacturing sector businesses in Taiwan appear more pessimistic on economic
growth in November than in the previous month, according to an economic outlook
survey released Tuesday by the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER).</P>
      <P>The survey results show that the number of respondents in the manufacturing and
services sectors predicting better economic growth in November than in October
fell by 6 percentage points, while those predicting poorer growth increased by
10.4 percentage points.</P>
      <P>In their predictions for the business climate in the coming six months, 67.1
percent of the respondents expressed pessimism, up from the 64.8 percent in
October.</P>
      <P>Those forecasting a better future increased from 4.3 percent to 5.8 percent,
while those predicting an unchanged economic climate fell from 30.9 percent to
27.1 percent.</P>
      <P>TIER Macroeconomic Forecasting Center Director Chen Miao pointed out that the
pessimistic atmosphere was mainly caused by the global economic slowdown, which
brought down demand and affected consumption around the world.</P>
      <P>According to the TIER survey, under the institute's calculation model, the
November business climate index in the manufacturing industry stood at 78.24
points in November, representing a drop of 9.56 points from the previous month's
87.8 points and marking the lowest level since 1979, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The November business climate index in the services industry stood at 89.56
points -- a drop of 4.87 points from the 94.43 recorded in October, the results
show.</P>
      <P>The survey also shows that the manufacturing businesses who said the economy
will worsen in November while forecasting that the economy will deteriorate even
more in the coming six months include electronics manufacturers, retail and
wholesale traders, banking and insurance operators and textile and ready-to-wear
garment makers.</P>

      <P>Nothing unusual has been detected in areas adjacent to a Kaohsiung County
poultry farm that was stricken by the H5N2 bird flu virus, and the public should
not be afraid to eat cooked chicken or eggs, local officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Yeh Kun-song, chief of the animal disease prevention institute in Kaohsiung
County, southern Taiwan, said the low-pathogenic H5N2 virus is not communicable
to humans, and the public can eat chicken without fear of contracting the virus.</P>
      <P>Starting Dec. 23, blood samples of chickens at the 76 poultry farms within a
radius of three kilometers of the infected poultry farm in Luchu township  will
be tested each month by county authorities for avian flu, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  protective fences have been erected around the township's poultry
farms in an effort to prevent the intrusion of migratory birds that may be
carrying the virus.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City officials said that people can also feel free to eat their
homegrown chickens, stressing that there is no record of the high-pathogenic
bird flu viruses in Taiwan and the low-pathogenic H5N2 strain is not known to
jump from birds to humans.</P>
      <P>In a bid to prevent an outbreak or the spread of bird flu, municipal authorities
are monitoring birds at bird shops and ports and collecting samples for testing,
Economic Affairs Bureau officials said.</P>
      <P>In late October, close to 400 chickens died at the Luchu poultry farm of what
was later confirmed to be the H5N2 avian flu virus.</P>
      <P>Following the confirmation last week by the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture
(COA), the poultry farmer agreed to cull his remaining 18,000 chickens and the
farm has suspended operations.</P>
      <P>COA Minister Chen Wu-hsiung confirmed a day earlier that there have been no
other cases of bird flu in Taiwan since late October and he urged the public not
to panic over speculations of an outbreak.</P>
      <P>In line with the central government's bird flu prevention efforts, the Taipei
county government announced Monday that all 98 samples collected from birds
within the county had tested negative.</P>
      <P>County authorities have demanded that local poultry owners disinfect their farms
during the period Jan.9-15 next year to prevent any possible outbreak of bird
flu in the winter, which is the high season for flu.</P>
      <P>On the offshore county of Kinmen, plant and animal disease prevention officials
disinfected local poultry farms Monday -- the latest round of such operations --
in the wake of the outbreaks of bird flu in China and Taiwan proper in recent
months. China's outbreaks were caused by the high-pathogenic H5N1 virus,
different from the H5N2 strain that affected the Luchu poultry farm.</P>
      <P>Kinmen animal disease prevention bureau chief Chuang Chien-kung said that during
the first 11 months of this year, 374 samples collected on 21 local poultry
farms and 90 samples from other birds had all tested negative for the virus.
This indicates that Kinmen is free from bird flu, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the county has stepped  up patrols  along its coastlines, in
collaboration with the Coast Guard Administration, to prevent the introduction
of bird flu via contraband products.</P>
      <P>According to Chuan, the Kinmen authorities carried out 190 rounds of
disinfection from the beginning of the year to Nov. 20, in view of its proximity
to China.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen county government said it will step up the frequency of its
disinfection programs, depending on the bird flu situation in China.</P>
      <P>Kinmen Island is located in the Taiwan Strait and lies closer to China's Fujian
province than to Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>Kinmen maintains direct ferry links with several Fujian ports via what are
commonly known as the mini links.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has been rated as "above acceptable" with an average score of 67.9 out of
a possible 100 for the overall international living environment by white-collar
foreign workers living in the country, according to the results of a government
survey released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking in a press conference, Sung Yu-hsieh, deputy minister of the Cabinet-
level Research, Development and Evaluation Commission (RDEC) , said the survey
will help the government better understand foreigners' living experience in
Taiwan and serve as a reference for the establishment and implementation of
future policies and measures.</P>
      <P>According to Lin Chi-fan, a professor from Shih Hsin University, which was
commissioned by the RDEC to conduct the survey, Taiwan received the highest
scores in the categories of friendly attitudes toward foreigners, which received
87 points, and social cohesion, with 82.2 points.</P>
      <P>He noted that the scores serve as indicators that most Taiwanese treat
foreigners living in the country well.</P>
      <P>The scores  were  compiled  on a five-rank  system:  very satisfactory,
satisfactory, acceptable, dissatisfactory, and very dissatisfactory, Lin
explained, adding that both of the highest figures cross the satisfactory level.</P>
      <P>The other areas evaluated, listed in order of the highest scores to the lowest,
are government performance,  service facilities provided for foreigners,
bilingual signage, bilingual websites and emergency assistance information, Lin
went on.</P>
      <P>In the area of government performance, the airport and customs garnered the
highest score of 75.8, while foreign worker employment consultation received the
lowest score of 63.8, barely passing the acceptable level, according to the
survey.</P>
      <P>Lin said that in terms of bilingual signage, most of the respondents complained
about the lack of bilingual markings on product packaging, or the covering up of
English labels on some imported items with Chinese labeling.</P>
      <P>As for emergency assistance information, he said the low scores result from the
lack of English communication abilities of the staff working in places such as
police stations and fire departments.</P>
      <P>Sung said that as part of the government's efforts to provide foreigners with
easier access to its information, a Web site portal for the English versions of
every government agency has been set up at english.www.gov.tw.</P>
      <P>He advised foreigners to call 0800-024-111 -- a 24-hour hotline -- to assist
them in solving problems including medical treatment, visas, housing,
employment, taxation and insurance in Chinese, English and Japanese.</P>
      <P>He said the international hotline service, which he described as the first of
its kind in the country, has gained a good reputation among the foreigners who
have used it, but he admitted that over 50 percent of the survey respondents
were unaware that the service even exists.</P>
      <P>Sung concluded  that Taiwan  overall  provides  a friendly environment for
foreigners but still has a great deal of room for improvement, especially in
terms of bilingual facilities and English communication abilities.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted Aug. 8-Sept. 16, received a total of 1,088 effective
responses, with a margin of error of 3 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China links will help Taiwan build pivotal regional role: MAC</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opening of daily flight services as well as direct shipping and postal links
across the Taiwan Strait will help Taiwan reinforce its pivotal role in the
region, but the government will never exchange Taiwan's independent sovereignty
for economic gains, a government official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Fu Dong-cheng, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC), said Taiwan's economic situation has remained stable since the Dec. 15
inauguration of direct links with China.</P>
      <P>The changing cross-strait relations will serve as a new start in Taiwan's
ambition to become a financial center and a transportation hub in the Asia-
Pacific region, he added.</P>
      <P>Over the past 10 years, he said, Taiwan has slid to the bottom among the four
Asian dragons due to its lack of normalized trade and economic ties. This
situation developed because there were no direct air transportation or shipping
networks between the two sides of the strait, he added.</P>
      <P>The MAC vice chairman  made the remarks at a seminar on cross-strait exchanges
in Tainan City, southern Taiwan that was held as part of efforts by President Ma
Ying-jeou's administration to explain its China policy.</P>
      <P>Since he came to office in May, Ma has been moving to make good on his pledge to
build better and closer ties with China, in part to reinvigorate Taiwan's
economy, but many people in southern Taiwan fear that his policies will
compromise Taiwan's interests.</P>
      <P>However, Fu said that although improved cross-strait ties will help Taiwan
regain momentum to boost its economic clout and strategic importance, the
government will not forswear Taiwan's national sovereignty for economic gains in
its dealings with China.</P>
      <P>"The government will definitely prioritize the interests of the Taiwan people in
its dealings with China," he stressed.</P>
      <P>From now on, co-prosperity and reconciliation will replace confrontation between
the two sides, he said.</P>
      <P>However, Fu added, it will take some time for Taiwan to benefit from the
positive effects of the direct cross-strait links.</P>
      <P>Turning to the forthcoming third round of bilateral talks between Taiwan's
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and China's Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , he said joint efforts  relating  to crime-fighting,
food  safety,  financial supervision and currency exchange settlement, and the
protection of Taiwan business interests in China will be discussed.</P>
      <P>Developing mutually beneficial economic ties is the centerpiece of the current
Taiwan-China relationship until such time as the two sides can move to talk
about political issues, he said.</P>
      <P>The MAC oversees the operations of the semi-official SEF, which is responsible
for handling cross-strait contacts and negotiations through two-way dealings
with the ARATS.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President wants investigators out of shadow of former head's scandal</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou encouraged members of the Bureau of Investigation under
the Ministry of Justice Tuesday to emerge from the shadow cast by their former
boss being sentenced to 10 years in prison for his role in helping the former
first family with its money laundering activities.</P>
      <P>Ma made the exhortation to boost the morale of the investigators at a ceremony
marking the end of a training program for 73 new bureau recruits after noting
that the former bureau head's misconduct had dealt a severe blow to their esprit
de corps.</P>
      <P>Former Investigation Bureau Director-General Yeh Sheng-mao was charged with
concealing  government  documents  and of leaking confidential information
related to money laundering activities by former President Chen Shui-bian, his
wife, son and daughter-in-law. He has been held in custody since Oct. 6.</P>
      <P>Urging all investigators to be clear about their duties, Ma said that "you
should be loyal to the nation, the people and the Constitution rather than the
president, the minister (of the justice department), the prosecutor-general, or
other superiors."</P>
      <P>He told the new recruits to maintain a sense of righteousness and integrity in
their work and to avoid succumbing to corruption.</P>
      <P>"If any one of you finds that members of my family have engaged in any
irregularities, you should report them to prosecutors, not to me," Ma said.</P>
      <P>In January this year, the Investigation Bureau received a report from the
international anti-money laundering organization Egmont Group regarding
suspicions raised by a Cayman Islands' financial intelligence unit about the
former first family laundering money through an account created under the name
of Chen's daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching at the Merrill Lynch Bank in Geneva,
Switzerland.</P>
      <P>Based on the report, the bureau's Anti-Money Laundering Center on Jan. 29
compiled a file intended for delivery to the Supreme Prosecutors Office. Yeh
later requested that the file be handed over to him, saying that he would pass
it to State Public Prosecutor General Chen Tsung-ming in person.</P>
      <P>However, instead of giving the file to Chen Tsung-ming or ordering an
investigation into the suspected money laundering, Yeh leaked its contents to
Chen Shui-bian -- the chief suspect who should have been the target of the
investigation -- during a visit to the former president's official residence in
late January.</P>

    <HEADLINE>The wait is over - the pandas have finally arrived</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 23 (CNA)
12/23/08  22:35:02
(By Luis Yu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The long-anticipated arrival of a pair of giant pandas from China has finally
come as Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan, landed at Taoyuan International Airport aboard
a EVA Airways charter flight and were whisked away by police motorcade to the
Taipei City Zoo, their new home, Tuesday evening.</P>
      <P>The pair of endangered animals arrived in Taoyuan International Airport at 5: 04
p.m. after a three-hour flight from Chengdu in Sichuan province, southwestern
China.</P>
      <P>Shortly after landing, the pandas were transported to the Taipei City Zoo in an
air-conditioned vehicle, traffic-free, escorted by a police motorcade and
jumping all red lights.</P>
      <P>They settled into their new home at the zoo around 7:45 p.m.</P>
      <P>With a month of quarantine ahead for Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan, the new residents
of Taipei City are expected to go on display on Jan. 25, just in time for the
Chinese New Year holidays.</P>
      <P>Yang Hsiao-tung,  director of Taipei City's Department  of Information and
Tourism, told reporters that the pandas slept through almost the entire flight.</P>
      <P>"The pandas behaved very well during the trip", said Yang, adding that their
well-being was monitored by experts every minute of the way.</P>
      <P>The pandas' arrival, however, is not without controversy. While supporters,
including the government administration of President Ma Ying-jeou, see the
pandas as a step towards easing tensions between China and Taiwan, opponents,
including the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), criticized Taiwan's
welcoming of the animals as buying into Beijing's ploy to win over the hearts
and minds of Taiwanese people and eventually reunify with the island.</P>
      <P>Since 1957, Beijing has used pandas as goodwill ambassadors, giving them to
countries, such as the United States, with which it wants to form good
relations.</P>
      <P>In the case of Taiwan, Beijing is giving the pandas without charging fees, which
it normally charges receiving countries. Not by accident, China gave the pandas
names that mean "reunite" or "reunion" if said together in Chinese, symbolizing
Beijing's hopes to eventually reunite with Taiwan, which has been ruled
separately since the end of a bloody civil war in 1949.</P>
      <P>Some opposition lawmakers have vowed to not only boycott the pandas, but not
allow their family members to see them. Another was seen on TV suggesting that
Taiwan give a pair of monkeys native to the island to China and name them "Tai
Tai" and "Du Du" - which said together in Chinese means "Taiwan independence."</P>
      <P>Regardless of how the Taiwanese public will see the pandas, Taipei's city
government is hoping the animals will boost visitors at the zoo, with Mayor Hau
Lung-bin saying recently that he expects six million visitors at the zoo a year
as a result of the pandas.</P>
      <P>The zoo has prepared an outdoor enclosure decorated with ferns and a footbridge,
a sleeping area with all-season air conditioning and bamboo to welcome the two
pandas.</P>
      <P>Constructed with a NT$310 million sponsorship by the Shin Kong Group, the zoo's
new display facility is considered by many experts as a three-storey, "six-star"
mansion.</P>
      <P>Taipei's zoo is pulling out all the stops to make the pandas feel at home and
hopes the pair will eventually reproduce.</P>
      <P>A storage room is set aside especially to deposit fresh bamboo -- which is the
staple food for the pandas in their natural habitat. It is large enough to keep
560 kilograms of bamboo shoots to meet one week's demand by the animals. The
room's temperature will be maintained between 4 to 7 degrees Celsius, and to
satisfy the pandas' picky appetite, a water spray system was installed to keep
the bamboos fresh.</P>
      <P>Along with the two Chinese giant pandas, some 30 dove tree seedlings, China's
rare plant species, were also given to Taiwan as a token of peace.</P>
      <P>The exotic plants were allowed entry after testing negative to soil residues and
infectious insects. The plants will be nurtured in a greenhouse at the Fushan
Botanical Garden in northeastern Taiwan's Yilan County until they are mature
enough to be transplanted, after which they will be moved to another location.</P>
      <P>Chinese President Hu Jintao first offered the pandas to Taiwan as a gift of
friendship in May 2005 when then-opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan
made an ice-breaking visit to Beijing.</P>
      <P>However, the gift was blocked by political bickering between Beijing and Taipei
during Taiwan's time under the rule of the now-opposition DPP, which objected to
China's treatment of the panda transfer as a "domestic transfer" between zoos
because it implies that Taiwan is part of China.</P>
      <P>As giant pandas are an endangered species subject to the protection of the
Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora
(CITIES) , cross-border transfers of the animals must follow strict CITIES
guidelines.</P>
      <P>According to the guidelines, the two parties must supply export and import
permits confirming that all conditions for the transfer have been met. This
implies that the transaction is between two countries.</P>
      <P>However, the issue was resolved under the governance of the administration of
President Ma, which favors improving ties with China. Both sides decided to
sidestep the issue of country name by agreeing to identify the importer as
"Taiwan Taipei" and accepting "Chengdu" as the origin of export.</P>
      <P>During a landmark visit to Taiwan in November by top Chinese negotiator on
Taiwan affairs, Chen Yunlin, the two sides signed a formal agreement on
exchanges of indigenous rare fauna and flora species to symbolize their amity
and determination to cooperate in wildlife conservation.</P>
      <P>The pandas' arrival are the latest steps by the two sides to improve relations.
On Dec. 15, direct daily flights, direct shipping and direct postal links across
the Taiwan Strait were launched and over the weekend, China's banks pledged to
give US$19 billion in loans to Taiwanese businesses in China to help them cope
with the economic downturn.</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) condemned Chinese hackers
Tuesday for breaking into its Web site for a third time.</P>
      <P>Liao Chih-chien, deputy director of the DPP's Information and Culture
Department, confirmed that the Web site had been taken offline after staff found
that the DPP's party flag on the site had been replaced by China's national
flag.</P>
      <P>The Chinese hackers also posted the words "protesting the release" of former
President Chen Shui-bian. Chen was recently released from detention on his own
recognizance by the Taipei District Court after prosecutors indicted him and his
wife on charges of embezzlement, bribe-taking and money laundering.</P>
      <P>According to Liao, IT engineers would need one full day to check whether
important information on the site has been lost, and he added that it was not
expected to be back up until Wednesday.</P>
      <P>It is the third time Chinese hackers have broken into the DPP's Web site. The
previous two break-ins occurred in June 2004 when Chen Shui-bian was DPP
chairman and again later during the chairmanship of Yu Shyi-kun.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's status not belittled in pandas' delivery: MAC</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's sovereign status remains intact and was by no means belittled in the
delivery of two giant pandas to Taiwan from China, the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) said Tuesday in a statement.</P>
      <P>The council, which coordinates and plans Taiwan's policy toward China, issued
the statement after the Secretariat of the Convention of International Trade in
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) said earlier this week that
the transfer of pandas from China to Taiwan was in the category of
internal/domestic trade and consequently need not be reported to the
organization.</P>
      <P>Noting that CITES is a United Nations-affiliated international organization, the
MAC said that there is no way the transfer could alter the U.N.'s perception of
Taiwan's political status.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is not a CITES signatory, it is not obligated to report to the CITES
Secretariat its acceptance of the two pandas, the MAC said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, it added that Taiwan has consistently followed the strict CITES
provisions regarding imports of endangered animal and plant species, including
the giant pandas.</P>
      <P>In the process, the Bureau of Foreign Trade under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs first issued an import permit for the pair of pandas offered by China as
a gift of goodwill and friendship. With the import permit in hand, the Taipei
City Zoo then applied to the relevant Chinese agencies for an export permit.
China's endangered species export-import management office then issued export
documents for customs declaration.</P>
      <P>According to the MAC, the delivery of the pandas followed the mode of a country-
to-country transfer. If it was an internal/domestic transfer, no customs
declaration would be needed, the MAC added.</P>
      <P>After a long wait, the pair of rare animals -- Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan --
finally arrived in Taiwan Tuesday to settle in Taipei Zoo in a further sign of
rapidly warming ties between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

      <P>Manufacturing sector businesses in Taiwan appear more pessimistic on economic
growth in November than in the previous month, according to an economic outlook
survey released Tuesday by the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER).</P>
      <P>The survey results show that the number of respondents in the manufacturing and
services sectors predicting better economic growth in November than in October
fell by 6 percentage points, while those predicting poorer growth increased by
10.4 percentage points.</P>
      <P>In their predictions for the business climate in the coming six months, 67.1
percent of the respondents expressed pessimism, up from the 64.8 percent in
October.</P>
      <P>Those forecasting a better future increased from 4.3 percent to 5.8 percent,
while those predicting an unchanged economic climate fell from 30.9 percent to
27.1 percent.</P>
      <P>TIER Macroeconomic Forecasting Center Director Chen Miao pointed out that the
pessimistic atmosphere was mainly caused by the global economic slowdown, which
brought down demand and affected consumption around the world.</P>
      <P>According to the TIER survey, under the institute's calculation model, the
November business climate index in the manufacturing industry stood at 78.24
points in November, representing a drop of 9.56 points from the previous month's
87.8 points and marking the lowest level since 1979, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The November business climate index in the services industry stood at 89.56
points -- a drop of 4.87 points from the 94.43 recorded in October, the results
show.</P>
      <P>The survey also shows that the manufacturing businesses who said the economy
will worsen in November while forecasting that the economy will deteriorate even
more in the coming six months include electronics manufacturers, retail and
wholesale traders, banking and insurance operators and textile and ready-to-wear
garment makers.</P>
      <P>Only the manufacturers  of bicycles and bicycle parts and components said the
economy improved in November and predicted that it will get even better in the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nothing unusual has been detected in areas adjacent to a Kaohsiung County
poultry farm that was stricken by the H5N2 bird flu virus, and the public should
not be afraid to eat cooked chicken or eggs, local officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Yeh Kun-song, chief of the animal disease prevention institute in Kaohsiung
County, southern Taiwan, said the low-pathogenic H5N2 virus is not communicable
to humans, and the public can eat chicken without fear of contracting the virus.</P>
      <P>Starting Dec. 23, blood samples of chickens at the 76 poultry farms within a
radius of three kilometers of the infected poultry farm in Luchu township  will
be tested each month by county authorities for avian flu, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  protective fences have been erected around the township's poultry
farms in an effort to prevent the intrusion of migratory birds that may be
carrying the virus.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City officials said that people can also feel free to eat their
homegrown chickens, stressing that there is no record of the high-pathogenic
bird flu viruses in Taiwan and the low-pathogenic H5N2 strain is not known to
jump from birds to humans.</P>
      <P>In a bid to prevent an outbreak or the spread of bird flu, municipal authorities
are monitoring birds at bird shops and ports and collecting samples for testing,
Economic Affairs Bureau officials said.</P>
      <P>In late October, close to 400 chickens died at the Luchu poultry farm of what
was later confirmed to be the H5N2 avian flu virus.</P>
      <P>Following the confirmation last week by the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture
(COA), the poultry farmer agreed to cull his remaining 18,000 chickens and the
farm has suspended operations.</P>
      <P>COA Minister Chen Wu-hsiung confirmed a day earlier that there have been no
other cases of bird flu in Taiwan since late October and he urged the public not
to panic over speculations of an outbreak.</P>
      <P>In line with the central government's bird flu prevention efforts, the Taipei
county government announced Monday that all 98 samples collected from birds
within the county had tested negative.</P>
      <P>County authorities have demanded that local poultry owners disinfect their farms
during the period Jan.9-15 next year to prevent any possible outbreak of bird
flu in the winter, which is the high season for flu.</P>
      <P>On the offshore county of Kinmen, plant and animal disease prevention officials
disinfected local poultry farms Monday -- the latest round of such operations --
in the wake of the outbreaks of bird flu in China and Taiwan proper in recent
months. China's outbreaks were caused by the high-pathogenic H5N1 virus,
different from the H5N2 strain that affected the Luchu poultry farm.</P>
      <P>Kinmen animal disease prevention bureau chief Chuang Chien-kung said that during
the first 11 months of this year, 374 samples collected on 21 local poultry
farms and 90 samples from other birds had all tested negative for the virus.
This indicates that Kinmen is free from bird flu, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the county has stepped  up patrols  along its coastlines, in
collaboration with the Coast Guard Administration, to prevent the introduction
of bird flu via contraband products.</P>
      <P>According to Chuan, the Kinmen authorities carried out 190 rounds of
disinfection from the beginning of the year to Nov. 20, in view of its proximity
to China.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen county government said it will step up the frequency of its
disinfection programs, depending on the bird flu situation in China.</P>
      <P>Kinmen Island is located in the Taiwan Strait and lies closer to China's Fujian
province than to Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>Kinmen maintains direct ferry links with several Fujian ports via what are
commonly known as the mini links.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan graded `above acceptable' for living environment: poll</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 23 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has been rated as "above acceptable" with an average score of 67.9 out of
a possible 100 for the overall international living environment by white-collar
foreign workers living in the country, according to the results of a government
survey released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking in a press conference, Sung Yu-hsieh, deputy minister of the Cabinet-
level Research, Development and Evaluation Commission (RDEC) , said the survey
will help the government better understand foreigners' living experience in
Taiwan and serve as a reference for the establishment and implementation of
future policies and measures.</P>
      <P>According to Lin Chi-fan, a professor from Shih Hsin University, which was
commissioned by the RDEC to conduct the survey, Taiwan received the highest
scores in the categories of friendly attitudes toward foreigners, which received
87 points, and social cohesion, with 82.2 points.</P>
      <P>He noted that the scores serve as indicators that most Taiwanese treat
foreigners living in the country well.</P>
      <P>The scores  were  compiled  on a five-rank  system:  very satisfactory,
satisfactory, acceptable, dissatisfactory, and very dissatisfactory, Lin
explained, adding that both of the highest figures cross the satisfactory level.</P>
      <P>The other areas evaluated, listed in order of the highest scores to the lowest,
are government performance,  service facilities provided for foreigners,
bilingual signage, bilingual websites and emergency assistance information, Lin
went on.</P>
      <P>In the area of government performance, the airport and customs garnered the
highest score of 75.8, while foreign worker employment consultation received the
lowest score of 63.8, barely passing the acceptable level, according to the
survey.</P>
      <P>Lin said that in terms of bilingual signage, most of the respondents complained
about the lack of bilingual markings on product packaging, or the covering up of
English labels on some imported items with Chinese labeling.</P>
      <P>As for emergency assistance information, he said the low scores result from the
lack of English communication abilities of the staff working in places such as
police stations and fire departments.</P>
      <P>Sung said that as part of the government's efforts to provide foreigners with
easier access to its information, a Web site portal for the English versions of
every government agency has been set up at english.www.gov.tw.</P>
      <P>He advised foreigners to call 0800-024-111 -- a 24-hour hotline -- to assist
them in solving problems including medical treatment, visas, housing,
employment, taxation and insurance in Chinese, English and Japanese.</P>
      <P>He said the international hotline service, which he described as the first of
its kind in the country, has gained a good reputation among the foreigners who
have used it, but he admitted that over 50 percent of the survey respondents
were unaware that the service even exists.</P>
      <P>Sung concluded  that Taiwan  overall  provides  a friendly environment for
foreigners but still has a great deal of room for improvement, especially in
terms of bilingual facilities and English communication abilities.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted Aug. 8-Sept. 16, received a total of 1,088 effective
responses, with a margin of error of 3 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China links will help Taiwan build pivotal regional role: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  23 (CNA)

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opening of daily flight services as well as direct shipping and postal links
across the Taiwan Strait will help Taiwan reinforce its pivotal role in the
region, but the government will never exchange Taiwan's independent sovereignty
for economic gains, a government official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Fu Dong-cheng, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC), said Taiwan's economic situation has remained stable since the Dec. 15
inauguration of direct links with China.</P>
      <P>The changing cross-strait relations will serve as a new start in Taiwan's
ambition to become a financial center and a transportation hub in the Asia-
Pacific region, he added.</P>
      <P>Over the past 10 years, he said, Taiwan has slid to the bottom among the four
Asian dragons due to its lack of normalized trade and economic ties. This
situation developed because there were no direct air transportation or shipping
networks between the two sides of the strait, he added.</P>
      <P>The MAC vice chairman  made the remarks at a seminar on cross-strait exchanges
in Tainan City, southern Taiwan that was held as part of efforts by President Ma
Ying-jeou's administration to explain its China policy.</P>
      <P>Since he came to office in May, Ma has been moving to make good on his pledge to
build better and closer ties with China, in part to reinvigorate Taiwan's
economy, but many people in southern Taiwan fear that his policies will
compromise Taiwan's interests.</P>
      <P>However, Fu said that although improved cross-strait ties will help Taiwan
regain momentum to boost its economic clout and strategic importance, the
government will not forswear Taiwan's national sovereignty for economic gains in
its dealings with China.</P>
      <P>"The government will definitely prioritize the interests of the Taiwan people in
its dealings with China," he stressed.</P>
      <P>From now on, co-prosperity and reconciliation will replace confrontation between
the two sides, he said.</P>
      <P>However, Fu added, it will take some time for Taiwan to benefit from the
positive effects of the direct cross-strait links.</P>
      <P>Turning to the forthcoming third round of bilateral talks between Taiwan's
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and China's Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , he said joint efforts  relating  to crime-fighting,
food  safety,  financial supervision and currency exchange settlement, and the
protection of Taiwan business interests in China will be discussed.</P>
      <P>Developing mutually beneficial economic ties is the centerpiece of the current
Taiwan-China relationship until such time as the two sides can move to talk
about political issues, he said.</P>
      <P>The MAC oversees the operations of the semi-official SEF, which is responsible
for handling cross-strait contacts and negotiations through two-way dealings
with the ARATS.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President wants investigators out of shadow of former head's scandal</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 23 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou encouraged members of the Bureau of Investigation under
the Ministry of Justice Tuesday to emerge from the shadow cast by their former
boss being sentenced to 10 years in prison for his role in helping the former
first family with its money laundering activities.</P>
      <P>Ma made the exhortation to boost the morale of the investigators at a ceremony
marking the end of a training program for 73 new bureau recruits after noting
that the former bureau head's misconduct had dealt a severe blow to their esprit
de corps.</P>
      <P>Former Investigation Bureau Director-General Yeh Sheng-mao was charged with
concealing  government  documents  and of leaking confidential information
related to money laundering activities by former President Chen Shui-bian, his
wife, son and daughter-in-law. He has been held in custody since Oct. 6.</P>
      <P>Urging all investigators to be clear about their duties, Ma said that "you
should be loyal to the nation, the people and the Constitution rather than the
president, the minister (of the justice department), the prosecutor-general, or
other superiors."</P>
      <P>He told the new recruits to maintain a sense of righteousness and integrity in
their work and to avoid succumbing to corruption.</P>
      <P>"If any one of you finds that members of my family have engaged in any
irregularities, you should report them to prosecutors, not to me," Ma said.</P>
      <P>In January this year, the Investigation Bureau received a report from the
international anti-money laundering organization Egmont Group regarding
suspicions raised by a Cayman Islands' financial intelligence unit about the
former first family laundering money through an account created under the name
of Chen's daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching at the Merrill Lynch Bank in Geneva,
Switzerland.</P>
      <P>Based on the report, the bureau's Anti-Money Laundering Center on Jan. 29
compiled a file intended for delivery to the Supreme Prosecutors Office. Yeh
later requested that the file be handed over to him, saying that he would pass
it to State Public Prosecutor General Chen Tsung-ming in person.</P>
      <P>However, instead of giving the file to Chen Tsung-ming or ordering an
investigation into the suspected money laundering, Yeh leaked its contents to
Chen Shui-bian -- the chief suspect who should have been the target of the
investigation -- during a visit to the former president's official residence in
late January.</P>

    <HEADLINE>The wait is over - the pandas have finally arrived</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 23 (CNA)
12/23/08  22:35:02
(By Luis Yu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The long-anticipated arrival of a pair of giant pandas from China has finally
come as Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan, landed at Taoyuan International Airport aboard
a EVA Airways charter flight and were whisked away by police motorcade to the
Taipei City Zoo, their new home, Tuesday evening.</P>
      <P>The pair of endangered animals arrived in Taoyuan International Airport at 5: 04
p.m. after a three-hour flight from Chengdu in Sichuan province, southwestern
China.</P>
      <P>Shortly after landing, the pandas were transported to the Taipei City Zoo in an
air-conditioned vehicle, traffic-free, escorted by a police motorcade and
jumping all red lights.</P>
      <P>They settled into their new home at the zoo around 7:45 p.m.</P>
      <P>With a month of quarantine ahead for Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan, the new residents
of Taipei City are expected to go on display on Jan. 25, just in time for the
Chinese New Year holidays.</P>
      <P>Yang Hsiao-tung,  director of Taipei City's Department  of Information and
Tourism, told reporters that the pandas slept through almost the entire flight.</P>
      <P>"The pandas behaved very well during the trip", said Yang, adding that their
well-being was monitored by experts every minute of the way.</P>
      <P>The pandas' arrival, however, is not without controversy. While supporters,
including the government administration of President Ma Ying-jeou, see the
pandas as a step towards easing tensions between China and Taiwan, opponents,
including the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), criticized Taiwan's
welcoming of the animals as buying into Beijing's ploy to win over the hearts
and minds of Taiwanese people and eventually reunify with the island.</P>
      <P>Since 1957, Beijing has used pandas as goodwill ambassadors, giving them to
countries, such as the United States, with which it wants to form good
relations.</P>
      <P>In the case of Taiwan, Beijing is giving the pandas without charging fees, which
it normally charges receiving countries. Not by accident, China gave the pandas
names that mean "reunite" or "reunion" if said together in Chinese, symbolizing
Beijing's hopes to eventually reunite with Taiwan, which has been ruled
separately since the end of a bloody civil war in 1949.</P>
      <P>Some opposition lawmakers have vowed to not only boycott the pandas, but not
allow their family members to see them. Another was seen on TV suggesting that
Taiwan give a pair of monkeys native to the island to China and name them "Tai
Tai" and "Du Du" - which said together in Chinese means "Taiwan independence."</P>
      <P>Regardless of how the Taiwanese public will see the pandas, Taipei's city
government is hoping the animals will boost visitors at the zoo, with Mayor Hau
Lung-bin saying recently that he expects six million visitors at the zoo a year
as a result of the pandas.</P>
      <P>The zoo has prepared an outdoor enclosure decorated with ferns and a footbridge,
a sleeping area with all-season air conditioning and bamboo to welcome the two
pandas.</P>
      <P>Constructed with a NT$310 million sponsorship by the Shin Kong Group, the zoo's
new display facility is considered by many experts as a three-storey, "six-star"
mansion.</P>
      <P>Taipei's zoo is pulling out all the stops to make the pandas feel at home and
hopes the pair will eventually reproduce.</P>
      <P>A storage room is set aside especially to deposit fresh bamboo -- which is the
staple food for the pandas in their natural habitat. It is large enough to keep
560 kilograms of bamboo shoots to meet one week's demand by the animals. The
room's temperature will be maintained between 4 to 7 degrees Celsius, and to
satisfy the pandas' picky appetite, a water spray system was installed to keep
the bamboos fresh.</P>
      <P>Along with the two Chinese giant pandas, some 30 dove tree seedlings, China's
rare plant species, were also given to Taiwan as a token of peace.</P>
      <P>The exotic plants were allowed entry after testing negative to soil residues and
infectious insects. The plants will be nurtured in a greenhouse at the Fushan
Botanical Garden in northeastern Taiwan's Yilan County until they are mature
enough to be transplanted, after which they will be moved to another location.</P>
      <P>Chinese President Hu Jintao first offered the pandas to Taiwan as a gift of
friendship in May 2005 when then-opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan
made an ice-breaking visit to Beijing.</P>
      <P>However, the gift was blocked by political bickering between Beijing and Taipei
during Taiwan's time under the rule of the now-opposition DPP, which objected to
China's treatment of the panda transfer as a "domestic transfer" between zoos
because it implies that Taiwan is part of China.</P>
      <P>As giant pandas are an endangered species subject to the protection of the
Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora
(CITIES) , cross-border transfers of the animals must follow strict CITIES
guidelines.</P>
      <P>According to the guidelines, the two parties must supply export and import
permits confirming that all conditions for the transfer have been met. This
implies that the transaction is between two countries.</P>
      <P>However, the issue was resolved under the governance of the administration of
President Ma, which favors improving ties with China. Both sides decided to
sidestep the issue of country name by agreeing to identify the importer as
"Taiwan Taipei" and accepting "Chengdu" as the origin of export.</P>
      <P>During a landmark visit to Taiwan in November by top Chinese negotiator on
Taiwan affairs, Chen Yunlin, the two sides signed a formal agreement on
exchanges of indigenous rare fauna and flora species to symbolize their amity
and determination to cooperate in wildlife conservation.</P>
      <P>The pandas' arrival are the latest steps by the two sides to improve relations.
On Dec. 15, direct daily flights, direct shipping and direct postal links across
the Taiwan Strait were launched and over the weekend, China's banks pledged to
give US$19 billion in loans to Taiwanese businesses in China to help them cope
with the economic downturn.</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) condemned Chinese hackers
Tuesday for breaking into its Web site for a third time.</P>
      <P>Liao Chih-chien, deputy director of the DPP's Information and Culture
Department, confirmed that the Web site had been taken offline after staff found
that the DPP's party flag on the site had been replaced by China's national
flag.</P>
      <P>The Chinese hackers also posted the words "protesting the release" of former
President Chen Shui-bian. Chen was recently released from detention on his own
recognizance by the Taipei District Court after prosecutors indicted him and his
wife on charges of embezzlement, bribe-taking and money laundering.</P>
      <P>According to Liao, IT engineers would need one full day to check whether
important information on the site has been lost, and he added that it was not
expected to be back up until Wednesday.</P>
      <P>It is the third time Chinese hackers have broken into the DPP's Web site. The
previous two break-ins occurred in June 2004 when Chen Shui-bian was DPP
chairman and again later during the chairmanship of Yu Shyi-kun.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's status not belittled in pandas' delivery: MAC</HEADLINE>

12/23/08  23:50:56

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's sovereign status remains intact and was by no means belittled in the
delivery of two giant pandas to Taiwan from China, the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) said Tuesday in a statement.</P>
      <P>The council, which coordinates and plans Taiwan's policy toward China, issued
the statement after the Secretariat of the Convention of International Trade in
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) said earlier this week that
the transfer of pandas from China to Taiwan was in the category of
internal/domestic trade and consequently need not be reported to the
organization.</P>
      <P>Noting that CITES is a United Nations-affiliated international organization, the
MAC said that there is no way the transfer could alter the U.N.'s perception of
Taiwan's political status.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is not a CITES signatory, it is not obligated to report to the CITES
Secretariat its acceptance of the two pandas, the MAC said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, it added that Taiwan has consistently followed the strict CITES
provisions regarding imports of endangered animal and plant species, including
the giant pandas.</P>
      <P>In the process, the Bureau of Foreign Trade under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs first issued an import permit for the pair of pandas offered by China as
a gift of goodwill and friendship. With the import permit in hand, the Taipei
City Zoo then applied to the relevant Chinese agencies for an export permit.
China's endangered species export-import management office then issued export
documents for customs declaration.</P>
      <P>According to the MAC, the delivery of the pandas followed the mode of a country-
to-country transfer. If it was an internal/domestic transfer, no customs
declaration would be needed, the MAC added.</P>
      <P>After a long wait, the pair of rare animals -- Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan --
finally arrived in Taiwan Tuesday to settle in Taipei Zoo in a further sign of
rapidly warming ties between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan graded `above acceptable' for living environment: poll</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has been rated as "above acceptable" with an average score of 67.9 out of
a possible 100 for the overall international living environment by white-collar
foreign workers living in the country, according to the results of a government
survey released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking in a press conference, Sung Yu-hsieh, deputy minister of the Cabinet-
level Research, Development and Evaluation Commission (RDEC) , said the survey
will help the government better understand foreigners' living experience in
Taiwan and serve as a reference for the establishment and implementation of
future policies and measures.</P>
      <P>According to Lin Chi-fan, a professor from Shih Hsin University, which was
commissioned by the RDEC to conduct the survey, Taiwan received the highest
scores in the categories of friendly attitudes toward foreigners, which received
87 points, and social cohesion, with 82.2 points.</P>
      <P>He noted that the scores serve as indicators that most Taiwanese treat
foreigners living in the country well.</P>
      <P>The scores  were  compiled  on a five-rank  system:  very satisfactory,
satisfactory, acceptable, dissatisfactory, and very dissatisfactory, Lin
explained, adding that both of the highest figures cross the satisfactory level.</P>
      <P>The other areas evaluated, listed in order of the highest scores to the lowest,
are government performance,  service facilities provided for foreigners,
bilingual signage, bilingual websites and emergency assistance information, Lin
went on.</P>
      <P>In the area of government performance, the airport and customs garnered the
highest score of 75.8, while foreign worker employment consultation received the
lowest score of 63.8, barely passing the acceptable level, according to the
survey.</P>
      <P>Lin said that in terms of bilingual signage, most of the respondents complained
about the lack of bilingual markings on product packaging, or the covering up of
English labels on some imported items with Chinese labeling.</P>
      <P>As for emergency assistance information, he said the low scores result from the
lack of English communication abilities of the staff working in places such as
police stations and fire departments.</P>
      <P>Sung said that as part of the government's efforts to provide foreigners with
easier access to its information, a Web site portal for the English versions of
every government agency has been set up at english.www.gov.tw.</P>
      <P>He advised foreigners to call 0800-024-111 -- a 24-hour hotline -- to assist
them in solving problems including medical treatment, visas, housing,
employment, taxation and insurance in Chinese, English and Japanese.</P>
      <P>He said the international hotline service, which he described as the first of
its kind in the country, has gained a good reputation among the foreigners who
have used it, but he admitted that over 50 percent of the survey respondents
were unaware that the service even exists.</P>
      <P>Sung concluded  that Taiwan  overall  provides  a friendly environment for
foreigners but still has a great deal of room for improvement, especially in
terms of bilingual facilities and English communication abilities.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted Aug. 8-Sept. 16, received a total of 1,088 effective
responses, with a margin of error of 3 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>The wait is over - the pandas have finally arrived</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 23 (CNA)
12/24/08  10:31:30
(By Luis Yu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The long-anticipated arrival of a pair of giant pandas from China has finally
come as Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan, landed at Taoyuan International Airport aboard
a EVA Airways charter flight and were whisked away by police motorcade to the
Taipei City Zoo, their new home, Tuesday evening.</P>
      <P>The pair of endangered animals arrived in Taoyuan International Airport at 5: 04
p.m. after a three-hour flight from Chengdu in Sichuan province, southwestern
China.</P>
      <P>Shortly after landing, the pandas were transported to the Taipei City Zoo in an
air-conditioned vehicle, traffic-free, escorted by a police motorcade and
jumping all red lights.</P>
      <P>They settled into their new home at the zoo around 7:45 p.m.</P>
      <P>With a month of quarantine ahead for Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan, the new residents
of Taipei City are expected to go on display on Jan. 25, just in time for the
Chinese New Year holidays.</P>
      <P>Yang Hsiao-tung,  director of Taipei City's Department  of Information and
Tourism, told reporters that the pandas slept through almost the entire flight.</P>
      <P>"The pandas behaved very well during the trip", said Yang, adding that their
well-being was monitored by experts every minute of the way.</P>
      <P>The pandas' arrival, however, is not without controversy. While supporters,
including the government administration of President Ma Ying-jeou, see the
pandas as a step towards easing tensions between China and Taiwan, opponents,
including the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), criticized Taiwan's
welcoming of the animals as buying into Beijing's ploy to win over the hearts
and minds of Taiwanese people and eventually reunify with the island.</P>
      <P>Since 1957, Beijing has used pandas as goodwill ambassadors, giving them to
countries, such as the United States, with which it wants to form good
relations.</P>
      <P>In the case of Taiwan, Beijing is giving the pandas without charging fees, which
it normally charges receiving countries. Not by accident, China gave the pandas
names that mean "reunite" or "reunion" if said together in Chinese, symbolizing
Beijing's hopes to eventually reunite with Taiwan, which has been ruled
separately since the end of a bloody civil war in 1949.</P>
      <P>Some opposition lawmakers have vowed to not only boycott the pandas, but not
allow their family members to see them. Another was seen on TV suggesting that
Taiwan give a pair of monkeys native to the island to China and name them "Tai
Tai" and "Du Du" - which said together in Chinese means "Taiwan independence."</P>
      <P>Regardless of how the Taiwanese public will see the pandas, Taipei's city
government is hoping the animals will boost visitors at the zoo, with Mayor Hau
Lung-bin saying recently that he expects six million visitors at the zoo a year
as a result of the pandas.</P>
      <P>The zoo has prepared an outdoor enclosure decorated with ferns and a footbridge,
a sleeping area with all-season air conditioning and bamboo to welcome the two
pandas.</P>
      <P>Constructed with a NT$310 million sponsorship by the Shin Kong Group, the zoo's
new display facility is considered by many experts as a three-storey, "six-star"
mansion.</P>
      <P>Taipei's zoo is pulling out all the stops to make the pandas feel at home and
hopes the pair will eventually reproduce.</P>
      <P>A storage room is set aside especially to deposit fresh bamboo -- which is the
staple food for the pandas in their natural habitat. It is large enough to keep
560 kilograms of bamboo shoots to meet one week's demand by the animals. The
room's temperature will be maintained between 4 to 7 degrees Celsius, and to
satisfy the pandas' picky appetite, a water spray system was installed to keep
the bamboos fresh.</P>
      <P>Along with the two Chinese giant pandas, some 30 dove tree seedlings, China's
rare plant species, were also given to Taiwan as a token of peace.</P>
      <P>The exotic plants were allowed entry after testing negative to soil residues and
infectious insects. The plants will be nurtured in a greenhouse at the Fushan
Botanical Garden in northeastern Taiwan's Yilan County until they are mature
enough to be transplanted, after which they will be moved to another location.</P>
      <P>Chinese President Hu Jintao first offered the pandas to Taiwan as a gift of
friendship in May 2005 when then-opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan
made an ice-breaking visit to Beijing.</P>
      <P>However, the gift was blocked by political bickering between Beijing and Taipei
during Taiwan's time under the rule of the now-opposition DPP, which objected to
China's treatment of the panda transfer as a "domestic transfer" between zoos
because it implies that Taiwan is part of China.</P>
      <P>As giant pandas are an endangered species subject to the protection of the
Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora
(CITIES) , cross-border transfers of the animals must follow strict CITIES
guidelines.</P>
      <P>According to the guidelines, the two parties must supply export and import
permits confirming that all conditions for the transfer have been met. This
implies that the transaction is between two countries.</P>
      <P>However, the issue was resolved under the governance of the administration of
President Ma, which favors improving ties with China. Both sides decided to
sidestep the issue of country name by agreeing to identify the importer as
"Taiwan Taipei" and accepting "Chengdu" as the origin of export.</P>
      <P>During a landmark visit to Taiwan in November by top Chinese negotiator on
Taiwan affairs, Chen Yunlin, the two sides signed a formal agreement on
exchanges of indigenous rare fauna and flora species to symbolize their amity
and determination to cooperate in wildlife conservation.</P>
      <P>The pandas' arrival are the latest steps by the two sides to improve relations.
On Dec. 15, direct daily flights, direct shipping and direct postal links across
the Taiwan Strait were launched and over the weekend, China's banks pledged to
give US$19 billion in loans to Taiwanese businesses in China to help them cope
with the economic downturn.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's status not belittled in pandas' delivery: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec.23 (CNA)
12/24/08  10:32:09
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's sovereign status remains intact and was by no means belittled in the
delivery of two giant pandas to Taiwan from China, the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) said Tuesday in a statement.</P>
      <P>The council, which coordinates and plans Taiwan's policy toward China, issued
the statement after the Secretariat of the Convention of International Trade in
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) said earlier this week that
the transfer of pandas from China to Taiwan was in the category of
internal/domestic trade and consequently need not be reported to the
organization.</P>
      <P>Noting that CITES is a United Nations-affiliated international organization, the
MAC said that there is no way the transfer could alter the U.N.'s perception of
Taiwan's political status.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is not a CITES signatory, it is not obligated to report to the CITES
Secretariat its acceptance of the two pandas, the MAC said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, it added that Taiwan has consistently followed the strict CITES
provisions regarding imports of endangered animal and plant species, including
the giant pandas.</P>
      <P>In the process, the Bureau of Foreign Trade under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs first issued an import permit for the pair of pandas offered by China as
a gift of goodwill and friendship. With the import permit in hand, the Taipei
City Zoo then applied to the relevant Chinese agencies for an export permit.
China's endangered species export-import management office then issued export
documents for customs declaration.</P>
      <P>According to the MAC, the delivery of the pandas followed the mode of a country-
to-country transfer. If it was an internal/domestic transfer, no customs
declaration would be needed, the MAC added.</P>
      <P>After a long wait, the pair of rare animals -- Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan --
finally arrived in Taiwan Tuesday to settle in Taipei Zoo in a further sign of
rapidly warming ties between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Opposition lawmakers seek 'Taiwanese' nicknames for Chinese pandas</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of opposition legislators invited the public Wednesday to think up some
"Taiwanese" nicknames for the pair of giant pandas presented by China, which
bear names the lawmakers contend are suggestive of Beijing's efforts to suppress
Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Submissions and voting for the new names are being accepted on the personal blog
of Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Twu Shiing-jer, and results of
the vote will be announced Dec. 31.</P>
      <P>Among the names that have received the most support so far are "Chih-ming, Chun-
chiao, " "one China, one Taiwan, and "Wang-yao, Wang-shih."</P>
      <P>The pandas that arrived at the Taipei Zoo Tuesday are called Tuan Tuan and Yuan
Yuan, which together mean "reunion, " a term which implies the unification of
Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>The group of lawmakers from the pro-independence DPP, including Twu, Kuan Bi-
ling, Chen Ting-fei and Chen Chi-yu, noted that pandas are always a "political
tool" of the Chinese communists and asked the public to be aware of what the
animals'  presence in Taiwan represented.</P>
      <P>"The DPP isn't trying to make things difficult for these two pandas. But when
Taiwan's people are visiting the pandas (at the zoo), they should not be
ignorant of the hidden meaning behind them," Kuan said.</P>
      <P>Kuan pointed out that the use of pandas by the Chinese communists as a tool to
build rapport with other countries began as early as the late 1950s when a pair
of pandas were given to the now-defunct Soviet Union.</P>
      <P>Besides giving five pandas to North Korea in the 1960s, Beijing further
presented the rare animals to the United States, Japan, France, the United
Kingdom, Germany, Mexico and Spain between 1972 and 1978, she noted.</P>
      <P>The export of pandas had been interrupted for more than 20 years when China gave
a pair of the animals to Hong Kong in 1999 to celebrate the second anniversary
of the handover of the former British colony to China.</P>
      <P>Another pair of pandas were presented to Hong Kong in 2007 to mark the 10th
anniversary of the handover, Kuan said.</P>
      <P>Now, she claimed, the acceptance of the gift by the Kuomintang (KMT)
administration is a prelude to Taiwan's unification with China and to the end of
the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The two pandas were offered to Taiwan in 2005 after a visit to China by then-KMT
Chairman Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>The offer, however, was rejected by the Council of Agriculture (COA) under the
then DPP administration on the grounds that Taiwan did not have adequate
conditions to raise the animals.</P>
      <P>The COA approved the Taipei Zoo's application to house the animals in August
2008, three months after the inauguration of President Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT.</P>

      <P>The first Pacific International Tourism Festival, one of the largest tourism
events to be held in Taiwan, hopes to attract visitors from around the globe to
Hualien County instead of other popular Southeast Asian tourist spots, an event
organizer said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang Legislator Fu Kun-chi, who represents the eastern county and is
helping organize the event, said Hualien's abundant natural beauty and the
opportunity to witness the first sunrise of 2009 from the county's Pacific Ocean
shores will be the festival's main selling points.</P>
      <P>The event will target tourists from China, Europe and North America who plan to
ring in the New Year in Asia, urging them to make Hualien their destination
instead of Thailand or the Philippines, Fu said.</P>
      <P>During the festival, slated to kick off Dec. 26 at the Meiluen Brewery and run
until Jan. 4, 2009, 189 stalls will be set up on the two sides of the road
leading to the brewery to improve the fortunes of local businesses, Fu added.</P>
      <P>One of the festival's highlights will be its opening ceremony on Dec. 27, which
will be jazzed up by a pop concert and a fireworks display and attended by
Premier Liu Chao-shiuan.</P>
      <P>Hakka music, indigenous dance and performances by local pop stars and
international entertainers will also liven up the 10-day event. Visitors will
also be able to enjoy light aircraft shows and military displays.</P>
      <P>Several exhibitions will also be staged to showcase Taiwan's top 100 premium
products, alternative energy products, weapons systems, motorbikes, works of art
and indigenous handicrafts.</P>
      <P>Fu said that at a time when Taiwan is reeling from the global economic downturn,
tourism remains one sector that can still inject vitality into the country's
economy, which is why the Cabinet decided to sponsor the 10-day festival by
drawing on the resources of many government agencies.</P>

      <P>The Taipei Zoo is working toward the goal of opening its new panda house to the
public in a month's time, an official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>However, it remains uncertain if the public will be able to visit the panda
house on Chinese New Year's Eve on Jan. 25 because the zoo is usually closed for
the holiday,  said zoo spokesman  Chin Shih-chien.</P>
      <P>A gift from China of a pair of giant pandas, named Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan, was
delivered to the zoo Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan's regulations, imported animals must remain in quarantine
for a minimum period of 30 days, during which they will be observed for any
infectious diseases or parasites.</P>
      <P>Chin said that during that period, animal quarantine officials will examine the
pandas every day, and the process is expected to be completed Jan. 23 once the
animals are determined to be in good health.</P>
      <P>Otherwise, the quarantine period could be extended, he said.</P>
      <P>After being given quarantine clearance, the pandas will have to be immunized
against canine distemper and rabies -- the two diseases most likely to infect
pandas -- before they could be put on public display at the zoo, Chin said.</P>

helping online businesses resist the global economic downturn.</P>

      <P>While this represents only about 1 percent of all consumption in Taiwan, it is
an important niche that seems to be recession-proof.</P>
      <P>"Home girls, " like Cindy, contribute heavily to this total. As soon as she gets
off work, Cindy jumps on a bus to get home before rush hour.</P>
      <P>Once at home, she immediately switches on her computer to access PTT, the
biggest bulletin board system in Taiwan, because she needs to place her order
for a pair of shoes together with other online shoppers before a 7 p.m.
deadline.</P>
      <P>"What else can be more important than this? " Cindy told the Central News
Agency, explaining that by joining with others to order 30 pairs of shoes from
one vendor, she can buy a pair she has long coveted for NT$1,500, 30 percent
less than normal.</P>
      <P>Cindy also often browses another mass order Web site called "ihergo, " meaning
"I love group purchases, " because "one can find almost everything there, "
including egg rolls made by inmates at Tainan Prison that she once bought.</P>
      <P>Buying goods online, she says, is no different from going out and shopping at
brick and mortar outlets, and it gives her the freedom to follow her own
inclinations.</P>
      <P>In order to make online shopping even more convenient, Cindy even bought a card
reader so she can use an online ATM system to pay for her purchases.</P>
      <P>In her early 20s and having just started a job, Cindy said she has been "living
on the Internet" since college, and fully qualifies to be described as a "home
girl."</P>
      <P>Some 30 percent to 40 percent of her spending is done on the Internet, and many
of her friends also live like this.</P>
      <P>As every weekend approaches, she stocks up on supplies so that she can spend her
off days at home, listening to music, watching movies and television series and
shopping online.</P>
      <P>Different from Cindy, who spends most of her income on clothing and accessories,
"home boy" Eric, prefers buying high-end 3C products and bicycle parts online.</P>
      <P>Their "shopping spirit, " so to speak, is on a par.</P>
      <P>According to Eric, there are many online bicycle boutiques that not only serve
the needs of amateurs but also professionals.</P>
      <P>The owner of several mountain and foldable bicycles and skilled at modifying
them, Eric told the CNA that one can find almost everything in online
professional bicycle stores -- from parts such as stems, handlebars, pedals to
accessories such as headlights, bike racks, bicycle pumps, and jerseys.</P>
      <P>Eric says e-commerce is highly appealing because you can find detailed product
descriptions, specify delivery location and time, return products during trial
periods, and pay online without any problem.</P>
      <P>"More importantly, online products are 'always' cheaper than brick and mortars,"
Eric said.</P>
      <P>Like Cindy, Eric stocks up on food for the weekend at a supermarket so that he
can spend even more time online looking for cheap deals.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the number of people like Cindy and Eric, who satisfy their daily
needs through e-commerce, is increasing. It is because of these "home girls" and
"home boys" that the online purchasing market is growing vigorously despite a
severe slump in overall retail sales.</P>
      <P>Song Ju-ping, senior public relations manager of Yahoo! Kimo Online Shopping
Mall, told the CNA that the e-commerce platform offers all kinds of discounts on
a daily basis that effectively attract repeat business and boost revenues, even
in a weak economy.</P>
      <P>According to Song, the e-commerce market has grown steadily, citing as proof an
underwear company that opened its Internet platform in mid-2008 and recorded
online sales of NT$12 million in October, more than it had ever sold in a month
at any retail outlet.</P>
      <P>Yahoo! Kimo Shopping Mall itself set sales records of 2000 boxes of toilet paper
in 28 minutes, over 4000 bottles of make-up removal oil in one hour, 200 laptops
and 180 motorcycles in a day, all after the global financial tsunami swept
Taiwan in October, Song said.</P>
      <P>Song said the timeless nature of online shopping has been a key factor in
expanding the business. For Yahoo! Kimo Shopping Mall, for instance, 9 p.m. to 2
a.m. is the peak sales period, with around 30 percent of sales occurring during
this time slot.</P>
      <P>"Compared to retail stores, one absolute advantage of online shopping is the
flexibility of transaction time," she said.</P>
      <P>Regardless of whether browsing an online auction or online shopping mall or
placing a bid or an order, the development of online shopping has only
entrenched the trend of "home boys" and "home girls" to stay at home, as well as
changed the shopping behavior of an increasing number of consumers.</P>
      <P>Despite the sluggish  economy,  many expect that with the e-commerce market
growing more mature, its share of Taiwan's retail spending will only continue to
expand.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Local universities offer free online courses for lifelong learning</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of local universities formed an alliance Wednesday to provide the public
with free online access to some of their formal course materials in the hope
that more people will make use of the country's higher education resources.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the inaugural meeting of the Taiwan OpenCourseWare Consortium
(TOCWC), Wu Chung-yu, president of the National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) ,
said the joint effort will help break space and time barriers to knowledge
exchange and communication.</P>
      <P>It will also create favorable conditions for lifelong learning as well as
helping self-educators in their pursuit of learning, he went on.</P>
      <P>According to Pai Chi-kaung, director-general of NCTU's Open Education Office, as
most OCW programs available online are in foreign languages, the setup of
Taiwan's own Web portal will enrich online Chinese educational resources.</P>
      <P>Students in China curious about how university classes are taught in Taiwan can
also gain an understanding via the online materials, she added.</P>
      <P>Pai said that her school currently offers over 40 online courses in calculus,
physics and chemistry, with outlines,  handouts, assignments and exams for the
courses all available on the Web site, "just like those you would get if you
attended classes in person." She also noted that video clips are available for
some of the courses.</P>
      <P>The other 15 universities that have joined the association, she continued, are
expected to offer a minimum of 10 courses over a two-year period from next
semester in their own competitive fields.</P>
      <P>Noting that the new service does not require registration, Pai added that as a
general rule, no degrees or certifications are awarded and the courses are
purely for people who are interested in the subjects and would like to educate
themselves.</P>
      <P>However, she said NCTU has made it an exception that if high school graduates
who apply to enter the school can pass the September exam on the subject they
have been self-learning when their freshman semester begins, they will be
eligible to apply for advanced credit standing.</P>
      <P>She also noted that TOCWC-allied schools have also agreed on the terms on which
their published online materials can be extracted, revised and redistributed, so
long as it is for non-commercial purposes and the author or reference is stated
along with the works.</P>
      <P>The OCW scheme, now viewed by more than 1 million visitors per month, was
launched by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the United States
in 2002, followed by Japan and Vietnam, according to Wu.</P>
      <P>According to MIT statistics, as of the end of 2007, the Web site hit-rate of its
database in Asia reached 21 percent, next only to 41 percent by North American
users.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan was ranked third in the world in 2004 in terms of most Web
hits on the MIT's OCW courses, Pai said.</P>

      <P>Construction of the Taoyuan International Baseball Stadium began Wednesday at a
site near the Taiwan High Speed Rail's Taoyuan Station, with its completion
scheduled for the end of 2009.</P>
      <P>Taoyuan County Magistrate Eric Liluan Chu presided over the groundbreaking
ceremony for the NT$836.3 million (US$25.31 million) project.</P>
      <P>Chu said the stadium, built to meet international standards, will be the best
baseball stadium in Taiwan,  and that after its completion, Taoyuan County will
be able to host national and international baseball tournaments.</P>
      <P>Baseball is the most popular sport in Taiwan. In the northern county of Taoyuan
alone, there are 106 amateur baseball teams. This is why the county government
pushed for central government funding to build an international baseball
stadium, according to Chu.</P>
      <P>The stadium, to be built on a 9.7-hectare site, will have 12,000 infield seats,
with room for future construction of outfield stands.</P>
      <P>Adjacent  to the stadium will be other sports facilities, including a practice
field for baseball and softball, a soccer field, eight basketball courts, three
tennis courts, two rollerblading rinks, a sports park for parents and their
children, and bicycle trails.</P>

      <P>The Hsinchu Biomedical Science Park will be fully operational  by 2013,
following a modification  to the development strategy earlier this year, science
park administration officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Randy Tzong-Ming Yen, director-general of the Hsinchu Science Park
Administration, said that from now on, most of that area of the park will be
devoted to a national medical center that focuses on clinical research and
translational medicine.</P>
      <P>Yen said he hopes the center will bridge the gap between clinical practice and
biomedical  research to boost Taiwan's biomedical industry.</P>
      <P>The Hsinchu Biomedical Science Park, a section of the Hsinchu Science Park
system, was planned by the Executive Yuan in 2003 and expected to be completed
by 2009. However, the park's development strategy was changed from fostering a
medical center to soliciting private companies by the previous Democratic
Progressive Party administration.</P>
      <P>The new Kuomintang administration, however, decided to return to the original
plan and began the development of the medical center after it came to power in
May.</P>
      <P>Construction of the medical center will take at least four to five years, which
means the park will not be fully operational until after 2013.</P>
      <P>To date, the government has spent some NT$10 billion to acquire the land and
build the facilities. The medical center will require an injection of up to
NT$10 billion, according to Yen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Negotiations with China must start from strong position: president</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday Taiwan will not negotiate with China in
fear but must instead start such negotiations from a position of strength.</P>
      <P>"We should not be lax in combat preparedness, and effective deterrence is our
basic strategy. We want to stop war but will not be afraid of war, and we will
prepare for war but refrain from provoking war, " Ma said while reviewing a
live-fire military exercise in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time that Ma was presiding over a live-fire training drill
since his inauguration May 20.</P>
      <P>At the suggestion of the military, Ma wore a bullet-proof vest and helmet for
safety reasons. In 2006, an anti-tank missile malfunctioned and exploded on a
beach just 200 meters away from an observation stand from which then-President
Chen Shui-bian was reviewing the annual Hankuang training exercise.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,686 officers and enlisted men were mobilized to take part in
Wednesday's live-fire exercise, code-named Lienyung, at the Baolishan military
base in southern Taiwan's Pingtung County.</P>
      <P>The drill was designed to hone the joint defense capabilities of various
branches of the military in the event of an invasion by an enemy force and to
verify the effectiveness of joint forces combat command and coordination.</P>
      <P>In the exercise, marines demonstrated their amphibious combat skills, traveling
from one field to another to lend support in thwarting invading forces, with the
assistance of naval, air and army airborne units.</P>
      <P>AAV-7 amphibious assault vehicles, which are in active service in the U.S.
military, made their debut in the land-based segment of the war games, carrying
marines to beachhead landings.</P>
      <P>The drill began with F-16 jet fighters scrambling to carry out a mock bombing
mission and Jiyang-class frigates joining the attack later. OH-58D Kiowa
reconnaissance helicopters and AH-IW attack helicopters from the Army Aviation
and Special Force Command then launched a counterattack on presumed invading
enemy forces.</P>
      <P>Army artillery brigades also launched beach attack on invading mock enemies,
which was followed by a mopping-up operations by the marines.</P>
      <P>The small-scale Lienyung drill capped the military's live-fire training
exercises for the year.</P>
      <P>Ma said at the conclusion of the exercise that it embodied the results of the
military's long-term training and combat preparedness.</P>
      <P>The smooth operation of the exercise indicates that the military has not been
slacking off in combat preparedness because of the recent improvement in
relations across the Taiwan Strait, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Even though a glimmer of hope has appeared on the horizon for cross-strait
peace, Ma continued, the goal of building up an elite force to deter invasion
remains valid and alive.</P>
      <P>Unlike the often much-hyped large-scale military exercises staged under the
previous administration, the Lienyung drill was pragmatic and practical, Ma
said, adding that the drill will help the local people to understand that the
military has continued to upgrade its combat tactics and strategies despite the
warming of cross-strait ties.</P>

      <P>The founder of a local charity dedicated to caring for people in a vegetative
state denied Wednesday that he used donations to his organization to buy land
for himself.</P>
      <P>Cao Ching, founder of the Genesis Social Welfare Foundation, admitted that he
did buy a lot of land in Miaoli County under his own name with foundation funds,
but claimed he did so only to sidestep legal limitations.</P>
      <P>According to Cao, the land consists of 19 plots, including one of two farm
fields that according to the law cannot be sold to any legal entity such as his
foundation.</P>
      <P>In order to acquire the land for Genesis, Cao said he bought it and entrusted
its ownership to his foundation, thereby stripping himself of the right to
dispose of it.</P>
      <P>He said he had explained this to the Next Weekly, a local tabloid, but could not
stop it from publishing a story earlier that day accusing him of
misappropriating the foundation's funds.</P>
      <P>Cao said the Genesis Foundation owns about 200 buildings and four pieces of land
around the island, with a combined market value of NT$2.4 billion (US$72.66
million.).</P>
      <P>All of the real estate and buildings have been used by the foundation as nursing
houses for people in a vegetative state or as service centers for street people
and elderly people who live alone, he went on.</P>
      <P>He said the foundation provides accommodation for 360 people in a vegetative
state, using both its own properties as well as an additional 26 rented
properties.</P>
      <P>At the same time, it also provides home delivery and home care services for
another 618 people in their own homes.</P>
      <P>Among its annual outlay of about NT$1 billion, Cao went on, about NT$100 million
comes from government grants with the rest coming from private donations,
including NT$100 million from lottery prizes for uniform invoices collected from
the public.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's central government will not allow local authorities to open offices in
China in the short term, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Liu Te-
shun said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The central government will not permit individual city or county authorities to
open offices on their own in China in the near future due to guidelines in its
cross-Taiwan Strait policy and Taiwan's overall national interests, Liu
stressed.</P>
      <P>"There is no legal basis for this and the existing Statute Governing the
Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area prohibits
local governments from doing so, " Liu told reporters.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the stipulation of the statute's Article 33, individuals,
institutional persons, groups or other organizations from Taiwan are banned from
setting up "any form of cooperative ties" with administrative  or political
organizations of any Chinese district, Liu emphasized.</P>
      <P>"This also includes opening or exchanging offices between similar groups of both
sides," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Individual local governments must not handle their own affairs with China
unilaterally, and negotiations on issues that might infringe upon the central
government authorities must be settled by the MAC or the semi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) , Liu said.</P>
      <P>The MAC vice chairman's statement came at a time when some local city and county
governments in Taiwan are reportedly planning to establish offices in China, in
different ways and through different channels, to facilitate increased two-way
exchanges.</P>
      <P>For instance, Nantou and Yunlin counties in central Taiwan are planing to open
offices in China or set up a mainland affairs department in the local
government, respectively, in their bid to sell agricultural and farm produce to
China and to court more Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Through the network set up between local farmer associations on both sides of
the strait, Nantou is working to set up a service center in Zhejiang Province
where returning Chinese tourists can pick up items they buy in Taiwan instead of
having to carrying them on board airplanes.</P>
      <P>The agriculture-based Yunlin County is meanwhile eyeing the huge Chinese market
for its fresh vegetables and fruits. Some 1,200 metric tons of Yunlin oranges
purchased by China in early November at above local market price were delivered
to China last week.</P>

      <P>World-renowned Chinese pianist Lang Lang will perform at the National Concert
Hall in Taipei Dec. 26, organizers of the show announced Wednesday at a press
conference.</P>
      <P>Blending traditions from the West and the Far East through his music, the young
piano maestro will delight piano-lovers all over Taiwan with his readings of the
classical works of Schubert, Bartok and Chopin.</P>
      <P>"Being so close to the holiday season, it is more like a late Christmas recital
for me," 26-year-old Lang said.</P>
      <P>Heralded as the "hottest artist on the classical music planet, " Lang has played
sold-out recitals and concerts in every major city in the world and is the first
Chinese pianist to be engaged by the Berlin Philharmonic, the Vienna
Philharmonic and various top American orchestras.</P>
      <P>Asked his opinion about being chosen by People Magazine as one of the top 10
sexiest men alive, he responded that he only feels sexy when he is playing the
piano.</P>
      <P>"The rhythm of the notes makes my blood pressure high, " said Lang.</P>
      <P>In August 2008, over 2 billion people -- almost a third of the world's
population -- watched Lang's performance at the opening ceremony of the Beijing
Olympics, where he was seen as a symbol of the youth and future of China.</P>
      <P>"I would like to spend my spare time doing charity work and convincing people
that music can change the world, " Lang said, adding that he is serving as an
international goodwill ambassador to the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF).</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, to fulfill his commitment to society, the Lang Lang International
Music Foundation was established in 2008 with the purpose of expanding young
audiences and inspiring future generations of musicians through its outreach
programs.</P>
      <P>"Growing up in China, I am living proof that music can change the world, " said
Lang, adding that "there are more than 40 million people learning piano in China
today compared to zero a few decades ago."</P>
      <P>Lang also serves on the Weill Music Institute Advisory Committee as part of
Carnegie Hall's educational program and is the youngest member of Carnegie
Hall's Artistic Advisory Board.</P>
      <P>"I am very anxious to contribute to the development of classical music in the
information era we are living in, " said Lang. "I want to share my experience
with more young  people  through  my participation in educational programs," he
went on.</P>
      <P>Despite  his young age,  Lang has performed  for numerous international
dignitaries, including former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, U.S. President
George Bush, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, Chinese President Hu Jintao and
President Horst Koehler of Germany, as well as former Russian Prime Minister
Vladmir Putin and French President Nicolas Sarkozy.</P>
      <P>He began playing at the age of 3 and by the age of 5 had won the Shenyang
competition and given his first public recital. Entering Beijing's Central Music
Conservatory aged 9, he won first prize at the Tchaikovsky International Young
Musicians Competition and played the complete 24 Chopin Etudes at the Beijing
Concert Hall at age 13.</P>
      <P>Lang's break into stardom came at 17, when he was called upon for a dramatic
last-minute substitution at the "Gala of the Century, " playing the Tchaikovsky
concerto with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.</P>
      <P>He has recently been added as one of the 250 Young Global Leaders picked by the

      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lee Ching-an, who is alleged to be an
American citizen, said Wednesday that the report of Washington's probe on Taiwan
lawmakers' U.S. citizenship is not final, but the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party  (DPP)  said the report  confirmed  that  Lee has dual
nationalities.</P>
      <P>Lee said in a news conference that the U.S. State Department is still
investigating whether she holds U.S. citizenship and that the report from the
American Institute in Taiwan's (AIT) Washington office is not the final result
of the investigation.</P>
      <P>She said even though her name was mentioned in the report, the report also said
that the U.S. government's review of whether Taiwanese lawmakers hold U.S.
citizenship is based on the records of the U.S. State Department, which may not
have the most up to date status of one's citizenship, meaning the report should
not be viewed as giving the final word on the issue.</P>
      <P>"People should not quote the report out of context and should let the
Legislative Yuan handle the case when the final result comes out," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, Lee became the focus of attention in a controversy about
lawmakers having foreign citizenship after a local tabloid magazine revealed
that she allegedly possesses a U.S. passport. However, Lee repeatedly argued
that she had lost her U.S. citizenship after she was sworn in as a Taipei city
councilor in 1994.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan's relevant stipulations, any lawmaker, if found to possess
foreign nationality, will be stripped of his or her duties at the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) was commissioned by the legislature
to facilitate the probe on the citizenship status of Taiwan's legislators,  but
was criticized by the DPP for not publicizing the results.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan decided Tuesday to classify the AIT's report as
confidential  and give it to individual  legislators.  The legislature's plenary
session will determine later how to deal with the report.</P>
      <P>After reviewing the report, DPP caucus whip Lai Ching-te said earlier Wednesday
in a news conference that according to the U.S. State Department, Lee still
holds a valid U.S. passport and therefore indeed possesses American citizenship.</P>
      <P>He urged Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng to immediately strip Lee of her
legislative position, and retrieve all salary she has gained since she was
elected as a public servant and subject her to criminal liability.</P>
      <P>Lai also singled out another KMT legislator Lee Ming-hsing, who failed to
renounce his foreign citizenship before his swearing-in in February, asking Wang
to revoke his position as well.</P>
      <P>Considering the DPP caucus reported Lee's case to the Taipei District
Prosecutors Office in March and that Lee has been under investigation, the
prosecutor's office said Wednesday that it had requested the MOFA to provide a
related report from Washington and will clarify whether Lee violated any law
after reviewing it.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Greenhouse gas reduction bill stalled in legislative committee</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 24 (CNA)
12/24/08  21:16:32
(By Emmanuelle Tzeng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators in the Health, Environment and Labor Committee failed to reach
consensus Wednesday in their review of a greenhouse gas reduction bill, which if
passed, would represent a milestone in Taiwan's environmental protection
efforts.</P>
      <P>The legislators disagreed on several clauses in the bill, including those on
carbon trade mechanisms and carbon emissions reduction targets.</P>
      <P>The committee will continue its review of the draft bill Thursday.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Tien Chiu-chen said at the
meeting that the legislation requires a "carrot and stick "approach that would
include provisions for carbon trading as well as greenhouse gas reduction
targets.</P>
      <P>In the Executive Yuan's version of the bill, however, carbon emission targets
are not stipulated.</P>
      <P>Legislator Huang Sue-ying, also of the DPP, suggested that an emission reduction
schedule should be included in the bill. She presented her own version of the
draft bill, in which short-, mid- and long-term targets are set to reduce
Taiwan's greenhouse gas emissions to 2000 levels by 2050.</P>
      <P>In response, Shen Shu-hung,  minister of the Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA), said that his agency does not favor putting an emissions
reduction schedule into the act, as the government  has already made promises
regarding greenhouse gas reduction and that some flexibility will be required in
future international negotiations.</P>
      <P>"Even if we put the targets into the act, they would only be declarative and
there would be no penalties for violations, " said the Cabinet-level EPA head.
The targets set in the government's version of the bill are tighter than those
in Huang's version, he added.</P>
      <P>President  Ma Ying-jeou  has vowed to hold Taiwan's total greenhouse gas
emissions at 2008 levels from 2016 to 2020, reduce the emissions to 2000 levels
by 2025, and halve them from 2000 levels by 2050. The targets are also noted in
the Sustainable Energy Policy Guidelines approved by the Cabinet in June.</P>
      <P>Environmentalists  protesting  outside the Legislative  Yuan Wednesday backed
the opinions of the opposition legislators, calling the bill a "blank cartridge"
in terms of emissions reduction and urging that the carbon trading proposal be
minutely detailed in the act to prevent big businesses from using the mechanism
as a profit-making tool.</P>
      <P>Some legislators have expressed worries that carbon trading would allow some
companies to produce high levels of emissions in Taiwan while planting trees
abroad to obtain carbon credits.</P>
      <P>Pan Han-shen, secretary-general of the Green Party Taiwan, criticized the draft
bill proposed by the Cabinet as lacking emission reduction targets and
ineffective in terms of emissions control.</P>
      <P>Noting that carbon dioxide emission is a global problem, Shen said that a carbon
offset program should be given priority in Taiwan and that carbon trading is a
vital part of a solution that would favor both the environment and the economy.</P>
      <P>The bill was drafted by the EPA in 2006 to establish a domestic legal framework
to manage greenhouse gas emissions in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Legislators began to review the draft in committee in April this year but failed
to agree on a number of clauses.</P>
      <P>If approved, the new act is expected provide the legal framework for the
establishment of a system to control greenhouse gas emissions and for trade in
carbon credits to help attain the government's emission reduction targets.</P>
      <P>In 2007, The EPA set up a national greenhouse gas registry to allow enterprises
to voluntarily report their emission inventories, in a bid to encourage
voluntary emission reduction among private companies.</P>
      <P>According to the EPA, 136 enterprises have registered their greenhouse gas
emission data to date.</P>
      <P>According to Shen, greenhouse gas emissions in Taiwan totalled 280 million tons
in 2007, a decrease of 3 million tons from 2006. He forecast  that the decrease
this year would be even bigger, considering the government's carbon-reduction
and energy-saving policies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT lawyer accuses court judge of dereliction of duty</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 24 (CNA)
12/24/08  21:54:09
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A lawmaker of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) filed a plea with the Control Yuan --
Taiwan's highest watchdog body -- Wednesday, accusing a court judge of
dereliction of duty and urging members of the Control Yuan to institute an
investigation into the judge's conduct.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chiu Yi, who has earned fame for exposing corruption in the past,
said in the plea that Chou Chan-chun, a Taipei District Court judge, "misused
his judicial power" by freeing former President Chen Shui-bian on his own
recognizance, even though the charges against Chen -- a chief defendant in four
corruption and money laundering cases -- could carry a 30-year prison sentence.</P>
      <P>Chiu pointed out that from 2006 to 2008, Chou has handled 37 cases in which the
defendants requested bail. "Chou Chan-chun has only allowed two defendants to be
released on bail, and there is no record showing that he has ever released
anyone without bail," Chiu said.</P>
      <P>Chiu said the decision to free the former president without bail was
"inconsistent" with the judge's previous rulings.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Chiu added, Chou is known to have canvassed for Chen in the lead-up
to the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections and was a member of an association
in support of Chen for president.</P>
      <P>According to Chiu, Chou is also known to have said on private occasions that if
he had been the presiding judge in the trial of the case involving President Ma
Ying-jeou's use of his special allowance during his tenure as Taipei mayor, he
would have sentenced Ma to 10 years in prison without even bothering to look at
the written indictment.</P>
      <P>In a ruling in April, the Taiwan High Court found Ma not guilty of misusing his
special allowance during his two four-year terms as Taipei mayor.</P>
      <P>Chiu concluded in his plea that Chou has apparently exceeded his limits as a
judge, and that based on Article 18 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Chou's "bias"
in executing his duty has made it necessary that he be removed from the panel of
judges trying the corruption and money laundering cases in which the former
president and three members of his family are defendants.</P>
      <P>Chen, his wife, son and daughter-in-law have been indicted on charges of
embezzlement, bribe-taking and money laundering.</P>
      <P>According to the Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutor's
Office, Chen and his wife embezzled NT$104 million (US$3.12 million) from a
special Presidential Office discretionary fund during his presidency from 2000
to 2008.</P>
      <P>They also took bribes worth NT$100 million and NT$200 million in connection with
a land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million in kickbacks to help a
contractor win the tender for a government construction project, according to
the indictment.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors have recommended that the former president be given the harshest
possible sentence for his alleged crimes involving nearly half a billion new
Taiwan dollars.</P>
      <P>They also demanded severe penalties for his wife, son and daughter-in-law in
light of their "unrepentant attitude" in the course of the investigations, and
recommended commuted sentences for 10 other defendants whom prosecutors said had
been cooperative and helpful in the process of the investigations.</P>
      <P>Chou, the presiding judge, and two other justices on his panel ruled on Dec. 13
that Chen should be freed on his own recognizance after being detained for 32
days while the prosecutors prepared their cases against him.</P>
      <P>However, the prosecutors appealed in the Taiwan High Court against Chen's
release. The high court sent the case back to the Taipei District Court for
reconsideration, but in a ruling on Dec. 18, Chou and the two other judges on
the panel upheld their previous decision, although they added a warning that
Chen should not intimidate or collude with the other defendants and witnesses in
the four cases.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's localities seeking to increase presence in China</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite a ban on local governments opening representative offices in China,
local authorities are studying feasible ways to handle growing exchanges across
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun said that
the central government will not permit local governments to open offices in
China at the present time, due to Taiwan's cross-Taiwan Strait policy, which
forbids such a practice, and considerations about overall national interests.</P>
      <P>According to Article 33 of the Statute Governing the Relations Between the
People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, Taiwanese individuals, groups
or other organizations are banned from setting up "any form of cooperative ties"
with administrative or political organizations of any Chinese district, Liu
said.</P>
      <P>Individual local governments must not handle their own affairs with China
unilaterally, and negotiations on issues that might infringe upon the central
government's authority must be settled by the MAC or the semi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) , Liu said.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless,  local governments are seeking to establish a presence in China
through different approaches, such as through farmers' associations or by
forming special task forces to deal with increased two-way activities.</P>
      <P>For instance,  Taiwan's offshore Kinmen County,  which has maintained direct
ferry services with the ports of Xiamen and Mawei in China's Fujian province
since 2001 and with Quanzhou in Fujian a few years later, has already created a
mainland affairs section under its transportation and tourism bureau in 2004.</P>
      <P>Kinmen authorities are hoping to open an office in Xiamen, which lies opposite
Kinmen across the Taiwan Strait, to deal with frequent exchanges between the two
sides.</P>
      <P>Relations between Taiwan and China have significantly improved after President
Ma Ying-jeou came to power in May. He sees improving ties with China as a key to
breathing life into Taiwan's economy and easing tensions between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Many local governments, while initially wary of being bombarded by an influx of
Chinese imports, are now seizing the opportunity to boost trade and tourism with
China.</P>
      <P>In central Taiwan, Nantou County is seeking to establish offices in China
through local farmers' associations, with coastal China's Zhejiang Province
being its first target, Nantou County Deputy Magistrate Chen Chih-ching said.</P>
      <P>Two years ago, Nantou and Zhejiang began negotiating setting up sisterhood ties
between Sun Moon Lake in Nantou and West Lake in Hangzhou. Authorities from both
sides are slated to jointly sponsor a "twin lakes" forum in February or March in
Taiwan to pave the way for clinching the sisterhood agreement, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Chungtai Buddhist Temple in Taiwan's Puli township -- the largest
of its kind in Southeast Asia -- is also a major attraction in Nantou and a
must-see spot for Chinese tourists thanks to its sisterhood ties with Linying
Temple in Hangzhou.</P>
      <P>Currently, Nantou-Zhejiang exchanges mainly focus on agriculture, tourism and
religion, Chen said. Through trade fairs in Zhejiang, Nantou County has sold
agricultural products worth US$7 million this year, and has signed a contract
worth NT$50 million (US$1.55 million), Chen said.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by the prospects for potential business opportunities between the two
sides, a Zhejiang delegation has visited Nantou County recently, and the two
sides are considering signing accords on agricultural cooperation, he said.</P>
      <P>Nantou County hopes to open an office in Zhejiang that will serve as a pickup
center of speciality items purchased by Chinese visitors in Nantou.</P>
      <P>Once such a facility is set up in Zhejiang, Chinese tourists from the province
can have their items on hand as soon as they return home, without having to take
them onboard airplanes - a measure which Chen said would be helpful to
attracting more Zhejiang tourists to Nantou.</P>
      <P>Nantou authorities hope to open such a service center in Zhejiang through the
network maintained between farmers associations on both sides. Meanwhile in
northern Taiwan, Taoyuan County has also already set up a unit in February 2007
to deal with foreign affairs, including those relating to China.</P>
      <P>Agriculture-based Yunlin County in central-southern Taiwan is assessing the
possibility of setting up a mainland affairs bureau to help promote sales of its
agricultural goods to China.</P>
      <P>In southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung City, China affairs are handled by the city's
economic affairs bureau, while neighboring Kaohsiung County is planning to
create a section in its civil affairs bureau aimed at handling foreign affairs,
including those concerning China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Hualien, Miaoli, Chiayi and Pingtung counties, although not projecting
to set up a permanent unit for that purpose at present, said that they will
consider doing so in the future, if cross-strait exchanges further increase.</P>

      <P>A 74-year-old American Catholic priest, Robert Crawford, was granted honorary
citizenship of Nantou County Wednesday, in recognition of his decades of work to
provide care and services for mentally and physically challenged people in the
central county.</P>
      <P>Nantou County Magistrate Lee Chao-ching presented the honorary citizenship
certificate to Crawford at the county hall, citing the priest's devotion to
equipping disabled young people with basic living skills.</P>
      <P>Crawford first came to Taiwan in 1961 as a missionary, and since then has been
devoting his efforts to social welfare work on the island.</P>
      <P>In 1988, Crawford joined efforts to establish an educational center in Changhua
County, central Taiwan for people with mental disabilities, and in 1992 founded
a similar facility in Puli township, Nantou County.</P>
      <P>In 2004, the priest established a training center for persons with multiple
disabilities at the Holy Rosary Church in Nantou's Chushan township. He started
a day care service, basic living skills training and home education for mentally
and physically challenged youth over the age of 15.</P>
      <P>Crawford, also known by the Chinese name Yu Jen-teh, said his efforts to
establish and operate educational facilities for people with mental disabilities
was inspired by his own brother who suffers from Down Syndrome.</P>
      <P>As special education programs in Taiwan cater mainly to teenagers and children,
Crawford said, he founded the Rosary training center to help those who are older
but cannot manage their daily routines.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Responding to the concerns expressed by some members of the U.S Congress over
the human rights trend in Taiwan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Wednesday that Taiwan has always respected the rights and freedoms of its
citizens, and in no way violated their human rights during a recent visit by a
Chinese official.</P>
      <P>The statement by MOFA spokesman Henry Chen was made in response to a letter sent
to U.S. President George W. Bush Tuesday by 14 members of the U.S. Congress,
asking him to keep a watchful eye on the current human rights situation in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The U.S congressmen also urged Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou to respect the
people's rights and freedom, adding that in accordance with Article II of the
Taiwan Relations Act, the United States aims to preserve and improve the human
rights condition of all Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>In their letter to Bush, the members of Congress mentioned the violent  clashes
in early November  between  the police  and pro-independence protesters who were
demonstrating over a visit to Taipei by China's top cross-strait negotiator Chen
Yunlin.</P>
      <P>The letter stated that President Ma's administration limited the freedom of its
citizens when the police violently arrested protesters who brandished the
Republic of China's national flag, and when people who were wearing anti-China
or pro-independence clothing were detained. The U.S government should therefore
monitor the current situation in Taiwan, it suggested.</P>
      <P>"We will look into the matter," said Henry Chen, adding that the government had
a responsibility to protect the visiting Chinese delegation against any kind of
violence.</P>
      <P>"The international community has welcomed closer bilateral ties between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait," said the MOFA spokesman, adding that most nations
understand that improvement in the relations between Taiwan and China can
contribute to peace and stability in the region.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Alternative route may replace planned Suao-Hualien freeway</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister  of Transportation  and Communications Mao Chi-kuo said Wednesday that
his ministry was considering using an alternative mountain route to replace the
planned  and  controversial  Suao-Hualien  freeway,   which environmentalists
have opposed.</P>
      <P>Mao told reporters at a weekly briefing held by the Cabinet that the original
plan to build a Suao-Hualien freeway has been suspended, and that another plan
is being considered to build an expressway along the mountains on Taiwan's east
coast between Suao in Yilan County and Chongde in Hualien County.</P>
      <P>He said the new plan is expected to be completed in the second half of 2009
before the new mountain route is subjected to an evaluation on its possible
effects on local environments.</P>
      <P>Mao added that he had no idea yet about the price tag of the alternative route,
but added that the funding will come from the budget of the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications.</P>
      <P>He also said that the government plans to turn eastern Taiwan into a "paradise
for cyclists" in two to three years, with plans to build bike trails, set up
rental shops, and provide repair services, so that it will become more
convenient for people to observe the beautiful sceneries along Taiwan's eastern
corridor.</P>
      <P>The original 86-kilometer four-lane Suao-Hualien freeway project, mapped out in
1994, was approved by the Cabinet in 1998. The proposed freeway, with 40 km of
tunnels and 37 km of bridges, would be part of a planned 259-km freeway linking
Suao to Taitung in southeastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Construction was to begin in 2003 and be completed in eight years at a cost of
NT$93 billion, but was halted because of strong opposition from some local
groups who voiced environmental concerns.</P>
      <P>Supporters for the project have contended that mountainous Hualien County, which
is relatively underdeveloped compared with counties to its west, needs a freeway
to stimulate the local economy.</P>
      <P>Opponents, however, argued that the freeway would ruin the beauty and ecological
environment of one of the most scenic parts of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The debate over whether to build the freeway has continued, with both the
central and local governments unable to resolve the issue. Environmental
activists continued their opposition although project planners tried to allay
their concerns by changing the route of the freeway to minimize the impact on
the local ecology.</P>
      <P>Hualien County is linked to Suao by an 87-km provincial highway expanded in the
1980s. The highway is often blocked by landslides during the typhoon and rainy
seasons. The county is also served by a railway between Hualien and Taipei, but
passengers often complain that tickets are hard to get.</P>

      <P>The former director-general of the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau
(MJIB), Yeh Sheng-mao, who has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for
withholding information about ex-President  Chen  Shui-bian's  alleged
involvement  in money laundering, was released on NT$5 million (US$151,515) bail
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court granted Yeh bail after holding its first hearing on Yeh's
appeal against the Taipei District Court's harsh prison sentence for him.</P>
      <P>Reasons on why the court decided to grant Yeh bail was not immediately
revealed.  Yeh's lawyer told reporters that Yeh's continued detention after
being sentenced in the trial of first instance would have violated the due
process of law, as Yeh was appealing the ruling.</P>
      <P>Despite his release, Yeh is required to report any change in his residence and
is barred from leaving the country.</P>
      <P>Yeh was indicted Aug. 28 for concealing and not investigating information  on
overseas bank accounts allegedly  held by the ex-president's family members in
the Caymen Islands in the Caribbean.</P>
      <P>The information was provided to the Investigation Bureau by international anti-
money laundering association Egmont Group on Jan. 28, but went missing after
being submitted to Yeh.</P>
      <P>At the third hearing in his trial, the district court ordered Yeh's detention on
the grounds that Yeh, by passing the information to Chen, might have "unduly
profited others, " a felony which gave the court the power to detain potential
offenders at its discretion.</P>
      <P>The district court did not grant Yeh bail even after handing down its sentence
on Dec. 4 in view of the severity of the offenses with which Yeh was charged.</P>
      <P>The court found Yeh guilty of corruption, concealing a government file and of
leaking confidential information, for which he was given a prison sentence of
eight and a half years.</P>
      <P>In the second  case,  Yeh was also convicted  of leaking confidential
information, for which he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.</P>
      <P>The two sentences combine into a jail term of 10 years, the verdict stated.</P>
      <P>At the center of the money-laundering case was a report delivered to the MJIB in
January by the international anti-money laundering organization Egmont Group, in
which the Cayman Islands' financial intelligence unit raised the suspicion that
the former first family was laundering money through an account created under
the name of Chen's daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching at the Merrill Lynch Bank in
Geneva, Switzerland.</P>
      <P>Based on the report, the bureau's Anti-Money Laundering Center on Jan. 29
compiled a file intended for delivery to the Supreme Prosecutors Office. Yeh
later requested that the file be handed over to him, saying that he would pass
it to State Public Prosecutor General Chen Tsung-ming in person.</P>
      <P>However, instead of giving the file to Chen Tsung-ming, Yeh leaked its contents
to Chen Shui-bian during a visit to the former president's official residence
between Jan. 31 and Feb. 1, according to the court's findings.</P>
      <P>The district court said in its verdict that Yeh's actions had undermined the
independence of Taiwan's justice institutions and caused "immeasurable damage"
to the country's image.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Prosecutors to appeal ex-president's release Thursday</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Prosecutors are ready to again appeal the Taipei District Court's decision to
release former President Chen Shui-bian on his own recognizance, Supreme
Prosecutors Office (SPO) sources said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors with the SPO's Special Investigation Division (SID) have finalized
preparations of all documents needed for the appeal, the sources said, adding
that barring unexpected developments, the appeal will be filed Thursday
afternoon at the earliest.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, the SID team handling the corruption and money
laundering case against the ex-president will ask the Taiwan High Court to hand
down a ruling on its request to have Chen detained again instead of sending the
case back to the district court for a new hearing as it did in the past.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 18, the Taipei District Court rejected prosecutors appeal and upheld its
earlier decision to free Chen without bail.</P>
      <P>In its Dec.13 ruling, the court ordered that Chen, who was detained Nov. 12, be
released without bail following his indictment, along with 13 other people, on
charges of embezzlement, corruption and money laundering.</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife are accused of siphoning off NT$104 million (US$3.12 million)
from a special Presidential Office discretionary fund during his presidency from
2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>They are also charged with accepting bribes worth NT$100 million and NT$200
million in connection with a land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million
in kickbacks to help a contractor win the tender for a government construction
project, according to the indictment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Greenhouse gas reduction bill stalled in legislative committee</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 24 (CNA)
12/24/08  21:16:32
(By Emmanuelle Tzeng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators in the Health, Environment and Labor Committee failed to reach
consensus Wednesday in their review of a greenhouse gas reduction bill, which if
passed, would represent a milestone in Taiwan's environmental protection
efforts.</P>
      <P>The legislators disagreed on several clauses in the bill, including those on
carbon trade mechanisms and carbon emissions reduction targets.</P>
      <P>The committee will continue its review of the draft bill Thursday.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Tien Chiu-chen said at the
meeting that the legislation requires a "carrot and stick "approach that would
include provisions for carbon trading as well as greenhouse gas reduction
targets.</P>
      <P>In the Executive Yuan's version of the bill, however, carbon emission targets
are not stipulated.</P>
      <P>Legislator Huang Sue-ying, also of the DPP, suggested that an emission reduction
schedule should be included in the bill. She presented her own version of the
draft bill, in which short-, mid- and long-term targets are set to reduce
Taiwan's greenhouse gas emissions to 2000 levels by 2050.</P>
      <P>In response, Shen Shu-hung,  minister of the Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA), said that his agency does not favor putting an emissions
reduction schedule into the act, as the government  has already made promises
regarding greenhouse gas reduction and that some flexibility will be required in
future international negotiations.</P>
      <P>"Even if we put the targets into the act, they would only be declarative and
there would be no penalties for violations, " said the Cabinet-level EPA head.
The targets set in the government's version of the bill are tighter than those
in Huang's version, he added.</P>
      <P>President  Ma Ying-jeou  has vowed to hold Taiwan's total greenhouse gas
emissions at 2008 levels from 2016 to 2020, reduce the emissions to 2000 levels
by 2025, and halve them from 2000 levels by 2050. The targets are also noted in
the Sustainable Energy Policy Guidelines approved by the Cabinet in June.</P>
      <P>Environmentalists  protesting  outside the Legislative  Yuan Wednesday backed
the opinions of the opposition legislators, calling the bill a "blank cartridge"
in terms of emissions reduction and urging that the carbon trading proposal be
minutely detailed in the act to prevent big businesses from using the mechanism
as a profit-making tool.</P>
      <P>Some legislators have expressed worries that carbon trading would allow some
companies to produce high levels of emissions in Taiwan while planting trees
abroad to obtain carbon credits.</P>
      <P>Pan Han-shen, secretary-general of the Green Party Taiwan, criticized the draft
bill proposed by the Cabinet as lacking emission reduction targets and
ineffective in terms of emissions control.</P>
      <P>Noting that carbon dioxide emission is a global problem, Shen said that a carbon
offset program should be given priority in Taiwan and that carbon trading is a
vital part of a solution that would favor both the environment and the economy.</P>
      <P>The bill was drafted by the EPA in 2006 to establish a domestic legal framework
to manage greenhouse gas emissions in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Legislators began to review the draft in committee in April this year but failed
to agree on a number of clauses.</P>
      <P>If approved, the new act is expected provide the legal framework for the
establishment of a system to control greenhouse gas emissions and for trade in
carbon credits to help attain the government's emission reduction targets.</P>
      <P>In 2007, The EPA set up a national greenhouse gas registry to allow enterprises
to voluntarily report their emission inventories, in a bid to encourage
voluntary emission reduction among private companies.</P>
      <P>According to the EPA, 136 enterprises have registered their greenhouse gas
emission data to date.</P>
      <P>According to Shen, greenhouse gas emissions in Taiwan totalled 280 million tons
in 2007, a decrease of 3 million tons from 2006. He forecast  that the decrease
this year would be even bigger, considering the government's carbon-reduction
and energy-saving policies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT lawyer accuses court judge of dereliction of duty</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 24 (CNA)
12/24/08  21:54:09
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A lawmaker of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) filed a plea with the Control Yuan --
Taiwan's highest watchdog body -- Wednesday, accusing a court judge of
dereliction of duty and urging members of the Control Yuan to institute an
investigation into the judge's conduct.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chiu Yi, who has earned fame for exposing corruption in the past,
said in the plea that Chou Chan-chun, a Taipei District Court judge, "misused
his judicial power" by freeing former President Chen Shui-bian on his own
recognizance, even though the charges against Chen -- a chief defendant in four
corruption and money laundering cases -- could carry a 30-year prison sentence.</P>
      <P>Chiu pointed out that from 2006 to 2008, Chou has handled 37 cases in which the
defendants requested bail. "Chou Chan-chun has only allowed two defendants to be
released on bail, and there is no record showing that he has ever released
anyone without bail," Chiu said.</P>
      <P>Chiu said the decision to free the former president without bail was
"inconsistent" with the judge's previous rulings.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Chiu added, Chou is known to have canvassed for Chen in the lead-up
to the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections and was a member of an association
in support of Chen for president.</P>
      <P>According to Chiu, Chou is also known to have said on private occasions that if
he had been the presiding judge in the trial of the case involving President Ma
Ying-jeou's use of his special allowance during his tenure as Taipei mayor, he
would have sentenced Ma to 10 years in prison without even bothering to look at
the written indictment.</P>
      <P>In a ruling in April, the Taiwan High Court found Ma not guilty of misusing his
special allowance during his two four-year terms as Taipei mayor.</P>
      <P>Chiu concluded in his plea that Chou has apparently exceeded his limits as a
judge, and that based on Article 18 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Chou's "bias"
in executing his duty has made it necessary that he be removed from the panel of
judges trying the corruption and money laundering cases in which the former
president and three members of his family are defendants.</P>
      <P>Chen, his wife, son and daughter-in-law have been indicted on charges of
embezzlement, bribe-taking and money laundering.</P>
      <P>According to the Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutor's
Office, Chen and his wife embezzled NT$104 million (US$3.12 million) from a
special Presidential Office discretionary fund during his presidency from 2000
to 2008.</P>
      <P>They also took bribes worth NT$100 million and NT$200 million in connection with
a land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million in kickbacks to help a
contractor win the tender for a government construction project, according to
the indictment.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors have recommended that the former president be given the harshest
possible sentence for his alleged crimes involving nearly half a billion new
Taiwan dollars.</P>
      <P>They also demanded severe penalties for his wife, son and daughter-in-law in
light of their "unrepentant attitude" in the course of the investigations, and
recommended commuted sentences for 10 other defendants whom prosecutors said had
been cooperative and helpful in the process of the investigations.</P>
      <P>Chou, the presiding judge, and two other justices on his panel ruled on Dec. 13
that Chen should be freed on his own recognizance after being detained for 32
days while the prosecutors prepared their cases against him.</P>
      <P>However, the prosecutors appealed in the Taiwan High Court against Chen's
release. The high court sent the case back to the Taipei District Court for
reconsideration, but in a ruling on Dec. 18, Chou and the two other judges on
the panel upheld their previous decision, although they added a warning that
Chen should not intimidate or collude with the other defendants and witnesses in
the four cases.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's localities seeking to increase presence in China</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 24 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite a ban on local governments opening representative offices in China,
local authorities are studying feasible ways to handle growing exchanges across
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun said that
the central government will not permit local governments to open offices in
China at the present time, due to Taiwan's cross-Taiwan Strait policy, which
forbids such a practice, and considerations about overall national interests.</P>
      <P>According to Article 33 of the Statute Governing the Relations Between the
People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, Taiwanese individuals, groups
or other organizations are banned from setting up "any form of cooperative ties"
with administrative or political organizations of any Chinese district, Liu
said.</P>
      <P>Individual local governments must not handle their own affairs with China
unilaterally, and negotiations on issues that might infringe upon the central
government's authority must be settled by the MAC or the semi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) , Liu said.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless,  local governments are seeking to establish a presence in China
through different approaches, such as through farmers' associations or by
forming special task forces to deal with increased two-way activities.</P>
      <P>For instance,  Taiwan's offshore Kinmen County,  which has maintained direct
ferry services with the ports of Xiamen and Mawei in China's Fujian province
since 2001 and with Quanzhou in Fujian a few years later, has already created a
mainland affairs section under its transportation and tourism bureau in 2004.</P>
      <P>Kinmen authorities are hoping to open an office in Xiamen, which lies opposite
Kinmen across the Taiwan Strait, to deal with frequent exchanges between the two
sides.</P>
      <P>Relations between Taiwan and China have significantly improved after President
Ma Ying-jeou came to power in May. He sees improving ties with China as a key to
breathing life into Taiwan's economy and easing tensions between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Many local governments, while initially wary of being bombarded by an influx of
Chinese imports, are now seizing the opportunity to boost trade and tourism with
China.</P>
      <P>In central Taiwan, Nantou County is seeking to establish offices in China
through local farmers' associations, with coastal China's Zhejiang Province
being its first target, Nantou County Deputy Magistrate Chen Chih-ching said.</P>
      <P>Two years ago, Nantou and Zhejiang began negotiating setting up sisterhood ties
between Sun Moon Lake in Nantou and West Lake in Hangzhou. Authorities from both
sides are slated to jointly sponsor a "twin lakes" forum in February or March in
Taiwan to pave the way for clinching the sisterhood agreement, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Chungtai Buddhist Temple in Taiwan's Puli township -- the largest
of its kind in Southeast Asia -- is also a major attraction in Nantou and a
must-see spot for Chinese tourists thanks to its sisterhood ties with Linying
Temple in Hangzhou.</P>
      <P>Currently, Nantou-Zhejiang exchanges mainly focus on agriculture, tourism and
religion, Chen said. Through trade fairs in Zhejiang, Nantou County has sold
agricultural products worth US$7 million this year, and has signed a contract
worth NT$50 million (US$1.55 million), Chen said.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by the prospects for potential business opportunities between the two
sides, a Zhejiang delegation has visited Nantou County recently, and the two
sides are considering signing accords on agricultural cooperation, he said.</P>
      <P>Nantou County hopes to open an office in Zhejiang that will serve as a pickup
center of speciality items purchased by Chinese visitors in Nantou.</P>
      <P>Once such a facility is set up in Zhejiang, Chinese tourists from the province
can have their items on hand as soon as they return home, without having to take
them onboard airplanes - a measure which Chen said would be helpful to
attracting more Zhejiang tourists to Nantou.</P>
      <P>Nantou authorities hope to open such a service center in Zhejiang through the
network maintained between farmers associations on both sides. Meanwhile in
northern Taiwan, Taoyuan County has also already set up a unit in February 2007
to deal with foreign affairs, including those relating to China.</P>
      <P>Agriculture-based Yunlin County in central-southern Taiwan is assessing the
possibility of setting up a mainland affairs bureau to help promote sales of its
agricultural goods to China.</P>
      <P>In southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung City, China affairs are handled by the city's
economic affairs bureau, while neighboring Kaohsiung County is planning to
create a section in its civil affairs bureau aimed at handling foreign affairs,
including those concerning China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Hualien, Miaoli, Chiayi and Pingtung counties, although not projecting
to set up a permanent unit for that purpose at present, said that they will
consider doing so in the future, if cross-strait exchanges further increase.</P>

      <P>A 74-year-old American Catholic priest, Robert Crawford, was granted honorary
citizenship of Nantou County Wednesday, in recognition of his decades of work to
provide care and services for mentally and physically challenged people in the
central county.</P>
      <P>Nantou County Magistrate Lee Chao-ching presented the honorary citizenship
certificate to Crawford at the county hall, citing the priest's devotion to
equipping disabled young people with basic living skills.</P>
      <P>Crawford first came to Taiwan in 1961 as a missionary, and since then has been
devoting his efforts to social welfare work on the island.</P>
      <P>In 1988, Crawford joined efforts to establish an educational center in Changhua
County, central Taiwan for people with mental disabilities, and in 1992 founded
a similar facility in Puli township, Nantou County.</P>
      <P>In 2004, the priest established a training center for persons with multiple
disabilities at the Holy Rosary Church in Nantou's Chushan township. He started
a day care service, basic living skills training and home education for mentally
and physically challenged youth over the age of 15.</P>
      <P>Crawford, also known by the Chinese name Yu Jen-teh, said his efforts to
establish and operate educational facilities for people with mental disabilities
was inspired by his own brother who suffers from Down Syndrome.</P>
      <P>As special education programs in Taiwan cater mainly to teenagers and children,
Crawford said, he founded the Rosary training center to help those who are older
but cannot manage their daily routines.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan respects its citizens' rights, freedoms: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  24 (CNA)
12/24/08  22:41:30
(by Luis Yu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Responding to the concerns expressed by some members of the U.S Congress over
the human rights trend in Taiwan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Wednesday that Taiwan has always respected the rights and freedoms of its
citizens, and in no way violated their human rights during a recent visit by a
Chinese official.</P>
      <P>The statement by MOFA spokesman Henry Chen was made in response to a letter sent
to U.S. President George W. Bush Tuesday by 14 members of the U.S. Congress,
asking him to keep a watchful eye on the current human rights situation in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The U.S congressmen also urged Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou to respect the
people's rights and freedom, adding that in accordance with Article II of the
Taiwan Relations Act, the United States aims to preserve and improve the human
rights condition of all Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>In their letter to Bush, the members of Congress mentioned the violent  clashes
in early November  between  the police  and pro-independence protesters who were
demonstrating over a visit to Taipei by China's top cross-strait negotiator Chen
Yunlin.</P>
      <P>The letter stated that President Ma's administration limited the freedom of its
citizens when the police violently arrested protesters who brandished the
Republic of China's national flag, and when people who were wearing anti-China
or pro-independence clothing were detained. The U.S government should therefore
monitor the current situation in Taiwan, it suggested.</P>
      <P>"We will look into the matter," said Henry Chen, adding that the government had
a responsibility to protect the visiting Chinese delegation against any kind of
violence.</P>
      <P>"The international community has welcomed closer bilateral ties between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait," said the MOFA spokesman, adding that most nations
understand that improvement in the relations between Taiwan and China can
contribute to peace and stability in the region.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Alternative route may replace planned Suao-Hualien freeway</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.   24   (CNA)
12/24/08  23:08:14
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister  of Transportation  and Communications Mao Chi-kuo said Wednesday that
his ministry was considering using an alternative mountain route to replace the
planned  and  controversial  Suao-Hualien  freeway,   which environmentalists
have opposed.</P>
      <P>Mao told reporters at a weekly briefing held by the Cabinet that the original
plan to build a Suao-Hualien freeway has been suspended, and that another plan
is being considered to build an expressway along the mountains on Taiwan's east
coast between Suao in Yilan County and Chongde in Hualien County.</P>
      <P>He said the new plan is expected to be completed in the second half of 2009
before the new mountain route is subjected to an evaluation on its possible
effects on local environments.</P>
      <P>Mao added that he had no idea yet about the price tag of the alternative route,
but added that the funding will come from the budget of the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications.</P>
      <P>He also said that the government plans to turn eastern Taiwan into a "paradise
for cyclists" in two to three years, with plans to build bike trails, set up
rental shops, and provide repair services, so that it will become more
convenient for people to observe the beautiful sceneries along Taiwan's eastern
corridor.</P>
      <P>The original 86-kilometer four-lane Suao-Hualien freeway project, mapped out in
1994, was approved by the Cabinet in 1998. The proposed freeway, with 40 km of
tunnels and 37 km of bridges, would be part of a planned 259-km freeway linking
Suao to Taitung in southeastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Construction was to begin in 2003 and be completed in eight years at a cost of
NT$93 billion, but was halted because of strong opposition from some local
groups who voiced environmental concerns.</P>
      <P>Supporters for the project have contended that mountainous Hualien County, which
is relatively underdeveloped compared with counties to its west, needs a freeway
to stimulate the local economy.</P>
      <P>Opponents, however, argued that the freeway would ruin the beauty and ecological
environment of one of the most scenic parts of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The debate over whether to build the freeway has continued, with both the
central and local governments unable to resolve the issue. Environmental
activists continued their opposition although project planners tried to allay
their concerns by changing the route of the freeway to minimize the impact on
the local ecology.</P>
      <P>Hualien County is linked to Suao by an 87-km provincial highway expanded in the

      <P>A blood donation drive was launched Wednesday around the country, with a cycling
event held in Taipei City a day earlier to help promote the one-month campaign,
Taiwan Blood Services Foundation Chairman Kuo-Sin Lin said that day.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the cycling event was aimed at persuading the public to donate
blood, as people are unwilling to go out and give blood in cold weather.</P>
      <P>The campaign is being organized by six blood donation centers in northern
Taiwan's Taipei and Hsinchu, central Taiwan's Taichung, southern Taiwan's Tainan
and Kaohsiung and eastern Taiwan's Hualien.</P>
      <P>Lin suggested that would-be donors should take good care of their health, as
only healthy donors are allowed to donate.</P>
      <P>According to the foundation's statistics, 1,099,942 people have donated blood to
date this year, with students making up the lion's share of 22.69 percent,
followed by people from the industrial sector, accounting for 19 percent.</P>
      <P>Held as part of the cycling event was a ceremony in which 10 people were
presented with prizes for designing slogans aimed at exhorting the public to

    <TEXT>
      <P>The former director-general of the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau
(MJIB), Yeh Sheng-mao, who has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for
withholding information about ex-President  Chen  Shui-bian's  alleged
involvement  in money laundering, was released on NT$5 million (US$151,515) bail
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court granted Yeh bail after holding its first hearing on Yeh's
appeal against the Taipei District Court's harsh prison sentence for him.</P>
      <P>Reasons on why the court decided to grant Yeh bail was not immediately
revealed.  Yeh's lawyer told reporters that Yeh's continued detention after
being sentenced in the trial of first instance would have violated the due
process of law, as Yeh was appealing the ruling.</P>
      <P>Despite his release, Yeh is required to report any change in his residence and
is barred from leaving the country.</P>
      <P>Yeh was indicted Aug. 28 for concealing and not investigating information  on
overseas bank accounts allegedly  held by the ex-president's family members in
the Caymen Islands in the Caribbean.</P>
      <P>The information was provided to the Investigation Bureau by international anti-
money laundering association Egmont Group on Jan. 28, but went missing after
being submitted to Yeh.</P>
      <P>At the third hearing in his trial, the district court ordered Yeh's detention on
the grounds that Yeh, by passing the information to Chen, might have "unduly
profited others, " a felony which gave the court the power to detain potential
offenders at its discretion.</P>
      <P>The district court did not grant Yeh bail even after handing down its sentence
on Dec. 4 in view of the severity of the offenses with which Yeh was charged.</P>
      <P>The court found Yeh guilty of corruption, concealing a government file and of
leaking confidential information, for which he was given a prison sentence of
eight and a half years.</P>
      <P>In the second  case,  Yeh was also convicted  of leaking confidential
information, for which he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.</P>
      <P>The two sentences combine into a jail term of 10 years, the verdict stated.</P>
      <P>At the center of the money-laundering case was a report delivered to the MJIB in
January by the international anti-money laundering organization Egmont Group, in
which the Cayman Islands' financial intelligence unit raised the suspicion that
the former first family was laundering money through an account created under
the name of Chen's daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching at the Merrill Lynch Bank in
Geneva, Switzerland.</P>
      <P>Based on the report, the bureau's Anti-Money Laundering Center on Jan. 29
compiled a file intended for delivery to the Supreme Prosecutors Office. Yeh
later requested that the file be handed over to him, saying that he would pass
it to State Public Prosecutor General Chen Tsung-ming in person.</P>
      <P>However, instead of giving the file to Chen Tsung-ming, Yeh leaked its contents
to Chen Shui-bian during a visit to the former president's official residence
between Jan. 31 and Feb. 1, according to the court's findings.</P>
      <P>The district court said in its verdict that Yeh's actions had undermined the
independence of Taiwan's justice institutions and caused "immeasurable damage"
to the country's image.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Prosecutors are ready to again appeal the Taipei District Court's decision to
release former President Chen Shui-bian on his own recognizance, Supreme
Prosecutors Office (SPO) sources said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors with the SPO's Special Investigation Division (SID) have finalized
preparations of all documents needed for the appeal, the sources said, adding
that barring unexpected developments, the appeal will be filed Thursday
afternoon at the earliest.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, the SID team handling the corruption and money
laundering case against the ex-president will ask the Taiwan High Court to hand
down a ruling on its request to have Chen detained again instead of sending the
case back to the district court for a new hearing as it did in the past.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 18, the Taipei District Court rejected prosecutors appeal and upheld its
earlier decision to free Chen without bail.</P>
      <P>In its Dec.13 ruling, the court ordered that Chen, who was detained Nov. 12, be
released without bail following his indictment, along with 13 other people, on
charges of embezzlement, corruption and money laundering.</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife are accused of siphoning off NT$104 million (US$3.12 million)
from a special Presidential Office discretionary fund during his presidency from
2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>They are also charged with accepting bribes worth NT$100 million and NT$200
million in connection with a land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million
in kickbacks to help a contractor win the tender for a government construction
project, according to the indictment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's localities seeking to increase presence in China</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 24 (CNA)
12/25/08  12:32:41
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite a ban on local governments opening representative offices in China,
local authorities are studying feasible ways to handle growing exchanges across
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun said that
the central government will not permit local governments to open offices in
China at the present time, due to Taiwan's cross-Taiwan Strait policy, which
forbids such a practice, and considerations about overall national interests.</P>
      <P>According to Article 33 of the Statute Governing the Relations Between the
People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, Taiwanese individuals, groups
or other organizations are banned from setting up "any form of cooperative ties"
with administrative or political organizations of any Chinese district, Liu
said.</P>
      <P>Individual local governments must not handle their own affairs with China
unilaterally, and negotiations on issues that might infringe upon the central
government's authority must be settled by the MAC or the semi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) , Liu said.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless,  local governments are seeking to establish a presence in China
through different approaches, such as through farmers' associations or by
forming special task forces to deal with increased two-way activities.</P>
      <P>For instance,  Taiwan's offshore Kinmen County,  which has maintained direct
ferry services with the ports of Xiamen and Mawei in China's Fujian province
since 2001 and with Quanzhou in Fujian a few years later, has already created a
mainland affairs section under its transportation and tourism bureau in 2004.</P>
      <P>Kinmen authorities are hoping to open an office in Xiamen, which lies opposite
Kinmen across the Taiwan Strait, to deal with frequent exchanges between the two
sides.</P>
      <P>Relations between Taiwan and China have significantly improved after President
Ma Ying-jeou came to power in May. He sees improving ties with China as a key to
breathing life into Taiwan's economy and easing tensions between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Many local governments, while initially wary of being bombarded by an influx of
Chinese imports, are now seizing the opportunity to boost trade and tourism with
China.</P>
      <P>In central Taiwan, Nantou County is seeking to establish offices in China
through local farmers' associations, with coastal China's Zhejiang Province
being its first target, Nantou County Deputy Magistrate Chen Chih-ching said.</P>
      <P>Two years ago, Nantou and Zhejiang began negotiating setting up sisterhood ties
between Sun Moon Lake in Nantou and West Lake in Hangzhou. Authorities from both
sides are slated to jointly sponsor a "twin lakes" forum in February or March in
Taiwan to pave the way for clinching the sisterhood agreement, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Chungtai Buddhist Temple in Taiwan's Puli township -- the largest
of its kind in Southeast Asia -- is also a major attraction in Nantou and a
must-see spot for Chinese tourists thanks to its sisterhood ties with Linying
Temple in Hangzhou.</P>
      <P>Currently, Nantou-Zhejiang exchanges mainly focus on agriculture, tourism and
religion, Chen said. Through trade fairs in Zhejiang, Nantou County has sold
agricultural products worth US$7 million this year, and has signed a contract
worth NT$50 million (US$1.55 million), Chen said.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by the prospects for potential business opportunities between the two
sides, a Zhejiang delegation has visited Nantou County recently, and the two
sides are considering signing accords on agricultural cooperation, he said.</P>
      <P>Nantou County hopes to open an office in Zhejiang that will serve as a pickup
center of speciality items purchased by Chinese visitors in Nantou.</P>
      <P>Once such a facility is set up in Zhejiang, Chinese tourists from the province
can have their items on hand as soon as they return home, without having to take
them onboard airplanes - a measure which Chen said would be helpful to
attracting more Zhejiang tourists to Nantou.</P>
      <P>Nantou authorities hope to open such a service center in Zhejiang through the
network maintained between farmers associations on both sides. Meanwhile in
northern Taiwan, Taoyuan County has also already set up a unit in February 2007
to deal with foreign affairs, including those relating to China.</P>
      <P>Agriculture-based Yunlin County in central-southern Taiwan is assessing the
possibility of setting up a mainland affairs bureau to help promote sales of its
agricultural goods to China.</P>
      <P>In southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung City, China affairs are handled by the city's
economic affairs bureau, while neighboring Kaohsiung County is planning to
create a section in its civil affairs bureau aimed at handling foreign affairs,
including those concerning China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Hualien, Miaoli, Chiayi and Pingtung counties, although not projecting
to set up a permanent unit for that purpose at present, said that they will
consider doing so in the future, if cross-strait exchanges further increase.</P>

      <P>A 74-year-old American Catholic priest, Robert Crawford, was granted honorary
citizenship of Nantou County Wednesday, in recognition of his decades of work to
provide care and services for mentally and physically challenged people in the
central county.</P>
      <P>Nantou County Magistrate Lee Chao-ching presented the honorary citizenship
certificate to Crawford at the county hall, citing the priest's devotion to
equipping disabled young people with basic living skills.</P>
      <P>Crawford first came to Taiwan in 1961 as a missionary, and since then has been
devoting his efforts to social welfare work on the island.</P>
      <P>In 1988, Crawford joined efforts to establish an educational center in Changhua
County, central Taiwan for people with mental disabilities, and in 1992 founded
a similar facility in Puli township, Nantou County.</P>
      <P>In 2004, the priest established a training center for persons with multiple
disabilities at the Holy Rosary Church in Nantou's Chushan township. He started
a day care service, basic living skills training and home education for mentally
and physically challenged youth over the age of 15.</P>
      <P>Crawford, also known by the Chinese name Yu Jen-teh, said his efforts to
establish and operate educational facilities for people with mental disabilities
was inspired by his own brother who suffers from Down Syndrome.</P>
      <P>As special education programs in Taiwan cater mainly to teenagers and children,
Crawford said, he founded the Rosary training center to help those who are older
but cannot manage their daily routines.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan respects its citizens' rights, freedoms: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  24 (CNA)
12/25/08  12:33:13
(by Luis Yu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Responding to the concerns expressed by some members of the U.S Congress over
the human rights trend in Taiwan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Wednesday that Taiwan has always respected the rights and freedoms of its
citizens, and in no way violated their human rights during a recent visit by a
Chinese official.</P>
      <P>The statement by MOFA spokesman Henry Chen was made in response to a letter sent
to U.S. President George W. Bush Tuesday by 14 members of the U.S. Congress,
asking him to keep a watchful eye on the current human rights situation in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The U.S congressmen also urged Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou to respect the
people's rights and freedom, adding that in accordance with Article II of the
Taiwan Relations Act, the United States aims to preserve and improve the human
rights condition of all Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>In their letter to Bush, the members of Congress mentioned the violent  clashes
in early November  between  the police  and pro-independence protesters who were
demonstrating over a visit to Taipei by China's top cross-strait negotiator Chen
Yunlin.</P>
      <P>The letter stated that President Ma's administration limited the freedom of its
citizens when the police violently arrested protesters who brandished the
Republic of China's national flag, and when people who were wearing anti-China
or pro-independence clothing were detained. The U.S government should therefore
monitor the current situation in Taiwan, it suggested.</P>
      <P>"We will look into the matter," said Henry Chen, adding that the government had
a responsibility to protect the visiting Chinese delegation against any kind of
violence.</P>
      <P>"The international community has welcomed closer bilateral ties between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait," said the MOFA spokesman, adding that most nations
understand that improvement in the relations between Taiwan and China can
contribute to peace and stability in the region.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Alternative route may replace planned Suao-Hualien freeway</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.   24   (CNA)

(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister  of Transportation  and Communications Mao Chi-kuo said Wednesday that
his ministry was considering using an alternative mountain route to replace the
planned  and  controversial  Suao-Hualien  freeway,   which environmentalists
have opposed.</P>
      <P>Mao told reporters at a weekly briefing held by the Cabinet that the original
plan to build a Suao-Hualien freeway has been suspended, and that another plan
is being considered to build an expressway along the mountains on Taiwan's east
coast between Suao in Yilan County and Chongde in Hualien County.</P>
      <P>He said the new plan is expected to be completed in the second half of 2009
before the new mountain route is subjected to an evaluation on its possible
effects on local environments.</P>
      <P>Mao added that he had no idea yet about the price tag of the alternative route,
but added that the funding will come from the budget of the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications.</P>
      <P>He also said that the government plans to turn eastern Taiwan into a "paradise
for cyclists" in two to three years, with plans to build bike trails, set up
rental shops, and provide repair services, so that it will become more
convenient for people to observe the beautiful sceneries along Taiwan's eastern
corridor.</P>
      <P>The original 86-kilometer four-lane Suao-Hualien freeway project, mapped out in
1994, was approved by the Cabinet in 1998. The proposed freeway, with 40 km of
tunnels and 37 km of bridges, would be part of a planned 259-km freeway linking
Suao to Taitung in southeastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Construction was to begin in 2003 and be completed in eight years at a cost of
NT$93 billion, but was halted because of strong opposition from some local
groups who voiced environmental concerns.</P>
      <P>Supporters for the project have contended that mountainous Hualien County, which
is relatively underdeveloped compared with counties to its west, needs a freeway
to stimulate the local economy.</P>
      <P>Opponents, however, argued that the freeway would ruin the beauty and ecological
environment of one of the most scenic parts of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The debate over whether to build the freeway has continued, with both the
central and local governments unable to resolve the issue. Environmental
activists continued their opposition although project planners tried to allay
their concerns by changing the route of the freeway to minimize the impact on
the local ecology.</P>
      <P>Hualien County is linked to Suao by an 87-km provincial highway expanded in the
1980s. The highway is often blocked by landslides during the typhoon and rainy
seasons. The county is also served by a railway between Hualien and Taipei, but
passengers often complain that tickets are hard to get.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Environmentalists oppose alternative Suao-Hualien roadway</HEADLINE>

      <P>Environmentalists expressed opposition Thursday to the government's plan to
build a mountainside roadway linking Suao and Hualien in eastern Taiwan, arguing
that it would be as damaging to the environment as the abandoned Suao-Hualien
freeway project.</P>
      <P>Pan Han-sheng, secretary-general of Green Party Taiwan, called the plan "old
wine in a new bottle" because it would follow a route that is almost the same as
the one planned in the scrapped freeway project.</P>
      <P>Pan argued that the new project's possible impact on the environment would not
be any less serious just because it is called by a different name.</P>
      <P>The government had originally designed a freeway between Suao and Hualien to
replace the existing winding roadway that cuts through coastal mountains and is
often blocked by landslides during heavy rains.</P>
      <P>The freeway project, which would have required extensive drilling of tunnels,
sparked great controversy due to its potential impact on the surrounding
ecosystem and was strongly opposed by environmental groups.</P>
      <P>It was ultimately rejected by an environmental impact assessment panel under the
Environmental Protection Administration in April 2008.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, Minister of Transportation and Communications Mao Chi-kuo said the
government is planning to build a mountainside alternative to the existing
coastal Suhua Highway.</P>
      <P>The project planning is expected to be completed in the second half of next
year, after which an environmental impact assessment will be conducted, Mao
said.</P>
      <P>Mao said the new roadway, likely to begin from Suao in Yilan County and end in
Chongde in Hualien County, will probably be an expressway rather than a freeway.</P>
      <P>Also Thursday, Huang Chi-pin, secretary-general of the Hualien County
Government, said the residents of Hualien are expecting a roadway on which they
can travel safely, and it does not matter what it is called.</P>
      <P>Huang said he hopes the project will begin as soon as possible to serve the
wellbeing of local residents.</P>

      <P>The 2009 New Years Day flag-raising ceremony will, for the first time, take the
form of a festival with folk arts performances and a sports carnival to attract
more people to celebrate the new year, one of the organizers said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Looking back on 2008, it might seem that there were ups and downs, but I hope
that everyone can set aside their differences and gather in front of the
Presidential Office on Jan. 1 to welcome a brighter new year, " said Lo Ching-
ping, chairman of the China Youth Career Development Association (CYCDA), at a
news conference.</P>
      <P>In contrast to previous years when people who attended the flag-raising ceremony
would disperse soon after it ended, this time everyone will be invited to stay
on and enjoy various fun events and performances, Lo said.</P>
      <P>According to Lo, the New Year flag-raising ceremony is scheduled to be held at
the Presidential Office plaza at 6: 30 a.m. on Jan. 1 and 46-year-old Taipei
Jingmei Girls High School Choir will lead the singing of the national anthem.</P>
      <P>From 8 a.m. to 2 p.m., the plaza will be turned into a carnival venue  for  folk
arts  performances  that  will  include  a leather-silhouette show, paper-
cutting, a 400-member lion dance, diabolo and rope skipping, as well as sports
events such as paint ball, bungy jumping and rock climbing, Lo added.</P>
      <P>Commissioned by the Presidential Office, Lo said, the 2009 New Years Day Flag
Raising Ceremony and the folk performance and sports carnival will be co-hosted
by the CYCDA, the Sports Affairs Council of the Executive Yuan, the Taipei-based
Chinese National Association of Industry and Commerce, the General Chamber of
Commerce of the Republic of China, and the Chinese National Federation of
Industries, with assistance from the defense and interior ministries.</P>
      <P>Traffic controls will be instituted on the roads around the Presidential Office
plaza Jan. 1 to facilitate the flag-raising ceremony on New Years Day, according
to CYCDA Deputy Secretary-General Lin Shui-rei, who also spoke at the news
conference.</P>
      <P>The traffic controls will be effective from Wednesday at midnight to 7: 30 a.m.
Thursday on Bo Ai Road, Hengyang Road, Xiangyang Road, Zhongshan South Road,

    <HEADLINE>Cross-strait ties have entered era of peace and prosperity: SEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  25 (CNA)
12/25/08  17:49:21

    <TEXT>
      <P>After almost six decades of political standoff, relations between Taiwan and
China have entered a stage of peace and prosperity, Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) Chairman, Chiang Pin-kung, said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chiang made the remarks during his keynote speech at an academic conference
concerning the significance of the two recent talks between Chiang and his
Chinese counterpart -- Chen Yunlin, president of the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS). The talks were the first between SEF and
ARATS in nearly 10 years.</P>
      <P>Chiang said that the cross-strait ties can be divided into two separate periods.</P>
      <P>"The first period fell between 1949 and 1987 when the two sides remained in a
political and military standoff ready to go to war at any moment and when Taiwan
developed its economy and China fortified its political structure," said Chiang.</P>
      <P>According to Chiang, the second period of Taiwan-China ties emerged between 1988
and 2007, when the two sides cooperated economically but competed politically.</P>
      <P>"During that period of time, China became a Taiwanese investors' paradise and
Taiwan's biggest comercial partner," said Chiang.</P>
      <P>The historical visit of ARATS President Chen to Taiwan in November marked the
third period in bilateral relations, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>"The signing of the four cooperation pacts, especially those concerning the
expansion of direct weekend charter flights between the two sides into a daily
service, and the launching of direct shipping and postal links marked a
historical moment and a new era in the Taiwan-China bilateral ties, "noted
Chiang.</P>
      <P>In relation to the agenda of the next round of dialogues, Chiang said that both
sides will give priority to the issues concerning joint efforts to combat crime,
inspection and quarantine of plants and animals, financial and industrial
cooperation, investment and intellectual property protection, fishery and
cultural and educational cooperation.</P>
      <P>"Our ultimate goal is to ink a comprehensive economic cooperation agreement
(CECA) with China," said Chiang, adding that such an agreement could avoid the
marginalization of Taiwan in the international community.</P>
      <P>Asked about the signing of a cross-strait peace agreement, Chiang said that in
order to achieve such a goal, the two side must first establish a mechanism of
mutual military trust and a framework of peaceful development.</P>
      <P>Chiang and Chen held landmark talks in Beijing in June this year, reaching
agreements on opening Taiwan wider to Chinese tourists and on launching direct
weekend charter flights between the two sides.</P>
      <P>In the second round of talks in November, the two sides signed accords on direct
shipping and postal links and daily passenger flights, as well as setting up a
food safety reporting mechanism.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, since being elected as president in March, has invested
enormous efforts in improving relations with Beijing, openly stating that he
will not pursue reunification nor independence during his term, favoring instead
the pursuit of a policy focused on economic ties, so as to revive Taiwan's
lagging economy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Gov't preparing to launch project to bolster Taiwan's exports</HEADLINE>

      <P>The administration will soon put forth a new project to help bolster Taiwan's
exports in the face of the global economic downturn, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Under the new "Zheng He" project -- named after a Ming Dynasty Chinese explorer
-- the administration will assist Taiwan's suppliers and manufacturers to churn
out more goods for exports, with the country's entire export trade being
targeted to turn from negative to positive growth, to top NT$500 billion
(US$15.15 billion) in 2009, Liu said during a regular Executive Yuan meeting.</P>
      <P>"It is hoped that the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) makes concerted
efforts under the banner of the new 'Zheng He' project to help Taiwanese
companies as a whole reach the target of receiving export orders worth over
NT$540 billion for 2009," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Mainland China and markets in emerging economies will be the main targets of the
"Zheng He" project, Liu added.</P>
      <P>Under the project, the government will invest NT$5.58 billion between 2009 and
2010 to improve Taiwan's environment for the export trade, including increasing
loans to exporters and providing export insurance, according to Huang Chih-peng,
director-general of the MOEA's Bureau of Foreign Trade.</P>
      <P>As part of the project, the MOEA will allocate NT$1 billion between 2009 and
2010 to help Taiwanese companies to increase exports of foodstuffs and processed
food products to China, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Huang added that the MOEA will also spend NT$1.8 billion between early 2009 and
2012 to assist Taiwanese companies to crack the markets of India, Russia,
Brazil, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and countries in the Middle East.</P>
      <P>Zheng He was a ranking official of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) , who led a
giant fleet of Chinese junk ships to Southeast Asia, from where the Ming vessels
are believed to have reached the west coast of Africa. He was instrumental in
building China into one of the maritime super powers in the world between the
14th and 17th centuries.</P>
      <P>Also on Thursday, Premier Liu urged relevant Cabinet agencies to be nimble in
carrying out the economic stimulus programs that the administration has laid out
in order to create more jobs to tackle Taiwan's rising unemployment problem.</P>
      <P>Taiwan had 507,000 jobless people in November, representing an unemployment rate
of 4.62 percent, with 202,000 of them having lost their jobs through downsizing
or company closures.</P>
      <P>The 4.62 percent jobless rate was a six-year high for the month, according to
the Directorate General of the Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>At the meeting Thursday, the premier said that Taiwan's recent accession to the
World Trade Organization's (WTO's) Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) will
help create huge and numerous trade opportunities  for Taiwanese companies as
the accession  gives Taiwanese companies open access to public contracts in the
40 other economies which have signed the GPA, including the United States, Japan
and the European Union.</P>
      <P>The WTO Committee on Government Procurement formally approved on Dec. 9 the
accession of Taiwan to the GPA -- under the name of Separate Customs Territory
of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>The accession, however,  will need formal approval by the Legislative Yuan to
make the WTO initiative legally effective, Liu said, adding that relevant
Cabinet agencies should waste no time to increase communications with
legislators so as to facilitate the formal accession.</P>

    <HEADLINE>20 percent of companies not offering year-end bonuses: poll</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A record high of nearly 20 percent of Taiwan companies will not be paying year-
end bonuses to their workers this year, and those that plan to do so will offer
an average 1.08 months' salary, according to the results of an online survey
released Thursday.</P>
      <P>The 1.08-month bonus offer is a drop of 0.53 months from the 2007 average,
according to the results of the survey conducted by the 104 job bank.</P>
      <P>The companies that will not offer year-end bonuses this year are mostly
businesses in the mass communications, transportation and warehousing,
construction and real-estate, tourism and leisure, and service sectors, the
survey found. Close to 30 percent of the firms in each of these sectors will not
pay any year-end bonuses to their employees this year.</P>
      <P>Among those enterprises that plan to give year-end bonuses to their workers, the
financial insurance sector is offering the biggest pay of 1.93 months' salary on
average, despite the economic slump, the survey indicated. However, even in that
sector the year-end bonus payment will be lower compared to last year's
2.6-month average.</P>
      <P>The hi-tech sector, though seriously hurt by the financial crisis, will pay
bonuses of 1.15 months' salary on average -- the second-highest among all
sectors, the survey found.</P>
      <P>In third place is the construction and real-estate sector, which will offer an
average of 1.11 months' salary to its workers, followed by the retail  sector
with bonuses  of 1.05 months  and the manufacturing sector with 1.04 months'
pay.</P>
      <P>Apart from paying year-end bonuses, it is also customary for companies in Taiwan
to hold a lavish banquet for their workers at the end of the year.</P>
      <P>However, while some 48 percent of the enterprises polled said they will maintain
the tradition, 21.4 percent indicated that they will not be doing so.</P>
      <P>About 24 percent said they will hold lucky draws and give cash gifts at the
parties for their workers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 40 percent of Taiwan businesses have decided not to increase wages in
the coming year, while around 8.8 percent said they are planning salary cuts for
"some workers," according to the survey.</P>
      <P>About 6 percent said they will cut salaries to all their employees in 2009 -- up
by 5.1 percentage points over the 2008 level.</P>
      <P>Most of the firms said they will slash salaries by some 10 percent, while 28.1
percent said the cut will be between 6 percent and 10 percent, and 41.3 percent
of the companies said it will be lower than 5 percent.</P>
      <P>Only 3.7 percent of the companies said they will increase the salaries of all of
their staff members, down by 15 percentage points from last year, according to
the survey.</P>
      <P>Around 49 percent of the businesses said they will adjust their workers'
salaries "depending on their performance."</P>
      <P>Some 31 percent said they will cut salaries based on the workers' positions --
meaning that middle and high ranking personnel should be braced for pay
reductions next year, as the companies battle with operation difficulties in an
economic recession.</P>
      <P>With profits shrinking as a result of the economic crisis, 65.5 percent of the
businesses said they thought their workers' morale has been affected, with 25
percent of the firms offering guarantees to protect their staffs' work rights,
the survey found.</P>

      <P>Officials of the Kaohsiung-based center explained that after receiving the
accreditation, the center's InfoCom Security Testing Laboratory will be able to
validate all cryptographic modules before they are exported to the United
States, reducing the time and cost of having them tested in the States.</P>
      <P>A cryptographic module is a security device that controls access to sensitive
data, secured service, or restricted areas. Common products include the digital
signature recognition module for e- commerce or online banking service, and the
fingerprint reader for household and office access monitoring.</P>
      <P>Officials said that TTC is the first institute in Taiwan and in Asia to be
accredited by NVLAP, a laboratory accreditation program run by the U.S. National
Institute of Standards and Technology.</P>
      <P>Once a product is verified by the center, they said, it will automatically be

      <P>Taiwan's Cabinet revised regulations governing China visits by government
employees Thursday, greatly relaxing travel restrictions on high-ranking
officials.</P>
      <P>Also amended were regulations concerning Taiwan visits by Chinese professionals
to ease the restrictions for Chinese government officials.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said the liberalization policy will facilitate the
exchanges between the two sides and help Taiwan's civil servants gain an in-
depth understanding of the situation in China, thus contributing positively to
establishing healthy relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Liu pledged that the government will make sure not to undermine Taiwan's
security when promoting the policy.</P>
      <P>The revised regulations will take effect on the date of their proclamation by
the Ministry of the Interior (MOI).</P>
      <P>They will allow police officers at rank 3 or higher and career civil servants at
grade 11 or higher who have no access to state secrets to visit China for any
purposes, including official business and pleasure, after obtaining permission
from a screening committee under the MOI, said Deputy Minister of the Interior
Lin Join-sane.</P>
      <P>For political appointees, local government chiefs and ordinary civil servants
with access to state secrets, they can visit China for any purpose other than
pleasure, after obtaining permission from the MOI's screening committee, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>Political appointees are currently only allowed to visit China for international
conferences or activities, and local government chiefs can only do so to take
part in conferences related to their work.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin said, the China travel ban on officials engaging in "special
services with access to state secrets" will remain to uphold national security
and interests, meaning that they are strictly  forbidden  from visiting  China
unless given special permission.</P>
      <P>These officials include personnel posted overseas, personnel engaging in the
research and development of defense or secret technologies, as well as staff of
the National Security Bureau, the Ministry  of National  Defense  and  the
Ministry  of Justice Investigation Bureau.</P>
      <P>For civil servants at grade 10 or lower, they will be able to visit China after
gaining the approval of the agencies they serve and will no longer be required
to apply for permission with the MOI, Lin said.</P>
      <P>On visits to Taiwan by Chinese officials, the revised regulations will allow
them to come to Taiwan for exchange activities at the invitation of a local
authority, a central government agency or the semi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Chinese officials are currently permitted to visit Taiwan only in a private
capacity and if they are invited by a school or civil organization in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Foreign aid to be transparent, professional, sustainable: MOFA</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that the principles of
transparency and professionalism, along with the global goal of sustainable
development, will be the pillars of its foreign aid policy, which will be laid
out in a white paper to be released in January.</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-bin, director-general of the MOFA's Department of Economic  and Trade
Affairs,  said at a press briefing  that transparency and professionalism  are
pivotal to enhancing the effectiveness of Taiwan's overseas aid.</P>
      <P>The ministry has therefore slashed its annual budget for secret diplomacy to
NT$3.8 billion (US$115.15 million) for next year, down by NT$2 billion from the
previous fiscal year, he said. This decision is also in line with the
Legislative Yuan's request to gradually reduce the amount of non-transparent
diplomatic funds, he added.</P>
      <P>In addition, Shih said, the government will help Taiwan's diplomatic allies to
achieve sustainable development through the transfer of Taiwan's expertise in
various fields, as part of its efforts to help realize the United Nations'
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).</P>
      <P>For instance,  techniques  passed on by Taiwan's  overseas agricultural teams
could help relieve extreme hunger and poverty in some areas of countries that
have diplomatic ties with Taiwan, he said. Also, the dispatch of mobile medical
missions would also assist those allies that are fighting against infectious
diseases and help to reduce infant mortality rates, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Shih said, Taiwan will also strengthen cooperation with relevant
international financial institutions, such as the Asian Development Bank, the
Central American Bank for Economic Integration, and the Inter-American
Development Bank.</P>
      <P>He made particular mention of possible cooperation schemes with Australia and
New Zealand to implement aid programs in the South Pacific region, adding that
the government will cooperate with relevant domestic non-governmental
organizations and the private sector to help with its aid programs.</P>

      <P>Taiwan spent NT$331.4 billion (US$10 billion) on research and development in
2007, accounting for 2.62</P>
      <P>percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for the year, a National
Science Council (NSC) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Citing results of the National Science and Technology Survey conducted by the
NSC, the council's Deputy Minister Chen Cheng-hong said the spending marked a
continuous increase for the past five years.</P>
      <P>Still, Taiwan's spending on R&amp;D fell behind its major competitor in the
high-tech field -- South Korea, whose R&amp;D spending accounted for 3.23
percent of its GDP last year.</P>
      <P>The results  also showed that Taiwanese  private  sectors' investment in
research and development increased every year since 2003. It accounted for more
than 70 percent of the national level for 2007, while the government's
investment did not increase by much, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan had 6,128 patent applications approved in the United States in
2007, dropping one notch to rank fifth place in the world and trailing behind
South Korea for the first time, according to Chen, who was also quoting the
survey results. Taiwan ranked fourth place in 2006.  In terms of the Science
Citation Index - an index of how often scientific papers from various countries
are cited, Taiwan ranked 15th in the world, up two notches from the level a year
earlier. Each research paper was cited 3.05 times, up from 2.92 times in 2006,
Chen said. Meanwhile, Taiwan ranked the ninth in terms of the number of research
papers covered in the Engineering Index, up two notches from the previous year,
Chen said. The index is a comprehensive bibliographic  database of engineering
research literature.</P>

      <P>Seedlings of the official city tree of China's southeastern city of Nanjing,
cedrus deodara, are expected to be planted in Taipei County sometime next year,
a county government source said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Paperwork pertaining to quarantine and exports of the seedlings is currently in
the pipeline in Nanjing City for the shipment of several thousand seedlings of
the conifer, as well as other trees, to Taipei County -- the largest and most
populous administrative district in Taiwan -- said Chen Yuan-chuan, a division
chief of the Taipei County Bureau of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,000 seedlings of cedrus deodara, 3,000 willow seedlings and 100
plum seedlings that the Nanjing city government promised to Taipei County are
expected to be delivered once Nanjing city  officials  complete  the  quarantine
paperwork  and the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture approves the imports,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>Taipei Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei visited Nanjing in July to promote two-way
tourism and cultural exchanges, during which he signed a memorandum of
understanding with Nanjing Mayor Jiang Hongkun and the city's Communist Party
leader Zhu Shanlu aimed at enhancing bilateral exchanges and cooperation.</P>
      <P>A botanist and a Nanjing city government official visited Taiwan recently to
probe the feasibility of the donation and gain a better understanding of the
suitability of Taipei County to grow the seedlings, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>After consulting with the botanist, the county government decided to first
cultivate the seedlings at a nursery in the county's Sansia township and to
eventually transplant the trees at Bitan, in Taipei City's southern outskirts.</P>

      <P>The offshore Kinmen County urged the central government Thursday to allow it to
open an office in Xiamen in China's Fujian Province, so as to better serve
Taiwanese people, especially those traveling between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Lin Chen-chia, director of the county's tourism bureau, suggested the central
government in Taipei face up to the fast-growing direct ferry services
maintained between Kinmen and Xiamen since January 2001 -- popularly known as
the "mini three links" which are also put in place between Taiwan-held Matsu
Island and Fujian's Mawei port.</P>
      <P>The number of passengers using the Kinmen-Xiamen mini links reached nearly one
million this year, an astounding jump from the 21,500 in the first year the
links were opened, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Kinmen authorities are particularly keen on opening an office to serve Kinmen
people in Xiamen given that more than 20,000 county residents are residing
there, he said.</P>
      <P>Now that direct air, shipping and postal links have also been put in place
between Taiwan proper and China this month, Lin suggested the central government
retool its current policy which bans city and county authorities from setting up
offices in China.</P>
      <P>Doing so will help boost exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Several cities and counties in Taiwan have expressed an interest in setting up
representative offices in China. Lin proposed the central government first allow
Kinmen County and Lienchiang County of Matsu Island to do so, due to their
proximities to China.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Wednesday that Taiwan's
local governments are prohibited from opening offices in China because there is
no legal basis for such a practice.</P>
      <P>A ban on local governments opening offices in China has pushed some cities and
counties to create special units or form task forces to deal with issues arising
from growing cross-strait activities. Some local authorities are also
considering setting up de facto representative offices in China through farmers'
associations or other trade or tourism-related groups.</P>

      <P>The government's policy of promoting "green" technology has helped generate
economic benefits of over NT$6 billion (about US$182 million) so far this year,
according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Industrial Development Bureau
(IDB).</P>
      <P>IDB officials noted Thursday that the government will integrate more resources
to provide private manufacturers with more improved technologies in the areas of
cleaner production process and eco- friendly waste treatment.</P>
      <P>Officials said the government will also assist private companies in earning eco-
friendly accreditations from the U.S., European countries, and other nations,
which will enhance their abilities to enter the overseas markets.</P>
      <P>According  to the bureau,  a subproject  of Eco-Technology Assistance and
Promotion has conducted 298 rounds of consultations, helping industrial players
save cost and increase production.</P>
      <P>The total monetary benefits resulting from the consultations have reached nearly
NT$4.3 billion so far this year, according to the bureau.</P>
      <P>And the technologies of microbe-based defatting procedures, composite chelating
agents, and other three inventions have also helped generate economic benefits
of NT$1.5 billion this year, the bureau said.</P>

      <P>The year "2009" and the English wording "Taiwan" embedded in huge hearts will be
lit up during the New Year's Eve fireworks display on the facade of Taipei 101,
one of the highest skyscrapers in the world, an official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Steven Kuo Su, deputy director-general of the Tourism Bureau, announced this
year's design at a news conference, adding that the Tourism Bureau, the Ministry
of Economic Affairs and Chunghwa Telecom Co., Ltd. together won the bid for the
right to stage the display.</P>
      <P>"The spectacular fireworks display at Taipei 101 has become one of the best ways
to promote tourism and raise Taiwan's international profile," said Kuo.</P>
      <P>He noted that last year, 75 television networks in 26 countries broadcast
footage of the New Year's Eve fireworks over Taipei 101, creating media
publicity that he estimated as being worth more than NT$100 million (US$3.03
million).</P>
      <P>Chen Chun-liang, designer of this year's lighting, said at the news conference
that the word "Taiwan" embedded in four hearts will be displayed on the facade
of Taipei 101, symbolizing "embracing Taiwan with great love."</P>
      <P>Appearing in green, red, blue and yellow, Chen said the four hearts also
represent sustainability,  happiness,  openness and friendliness, adding that
the various colors mean that everyone should tolerate each other's differences
to welcome in 2009.</P>
      <P>Liu Si-lin, head of the Tourism Bureau's international affairs section, said
that the NT$21 million lighting show will be lit for an hour when the clock
strikes midnight Dec. 31, and from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m.  Jan. 1-15.</P>
      <P>Last year's fireworks -- also sponsored by the Tourism Bureau -- lasted 188
seconds and was highlighted by the appearance of "2008" and the word "Taiwan"
illuminated on the building's facade after the fireworks ended.</P>

      <P>Two mobile medical missions Taiwan sent to Guatemala and Haiti, respectively, to
help deal with the aftermath of natural disasters in those allied countries
"caused sensation, " the International Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF)
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>As the mission to Guatemala reached out to several "very remote rural
settlements to which even the country's own medical staff would not go, " it was
very much welcomed by the local residents, ICDF Secretary-General Chen Lien-gene
told a press conference.</P>
      <P>He said the 10-member mission,  consisting  of physicians, surgeons, pharmacists
and nurses from the Taipei Medical University Hospital, visited eight towns in
the provinces of Izabal and Chiquimula during its two-week stay in the Central
American country.</P>
      <P>The mission provided much-needed medical assistance and supplies, benefiting
around 3,000 people, in the wake of widespread flooding and landslides caused by
a week of incessant rain in October, Chen went on.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan's first mobile medical mission to Haiti also provided
medical care to around 2,650 people who suffered from recent disasters in the
capital, Port-au-Prince, Chen added.</P>
      <P>A series of devastating storms killed nearly 800 Haitians and left hundreds
injured in the August-September  period,  while approximately 500 students and
teachers perished when a school in Port-au-Prince collapsed in November.</P>
      <P>Chen disclosed that including these two medical missions, the ICDF has
dispatched 18 missions, comprising 165 medical staff, to 13 countries this year,
helping around 30,000 people.</P>
      <P>The ICDF is tasked by the government with providing technical assistance,
investment and loans, international human resources and humanitarian aid to
countries in need, whether or not they have diplomatic relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ICDF sent its first mobile medical mission to northern India in December

      <P>Free public bus rides will be available from Jan. 1 for all registered residents
of the offshore Penghu County, the Penghu county government announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>Penghu Magistrate Wang Chien-fa encouraged residents to use the free buses
instead of using their cars or motorbikes, to help reduce carbon dioxide
emissions.</P>
      <P>The county  government  recently  allocated  NT$20  million (US$606,060)  to
support the initiative  after several  county councilors proposed that the
county government should provide its residents with better social welfare
programs and help promote environmental protection awareness, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Students on Penghu have been allowed to ride the public buses free of charge
from Dec. 1.</P>
      <P>Penghu is one of the very few counties in the country to provide its residents
with free buses.</P>
      <P>The outlying island of Kinmen was the first county to do so eight years ago
after the Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Inc. -- the island's cash cow -- regularly paid
huge amounts of taxes to the county government, which in turn spent the money on
improving welfare programs for the people there.</P>
      <P>The number of registered Kinmen residents stands at about 80,000, but only
around 40,000 to 50,000 people regularly reside there.</P>

      <P>More than two-thirds of respondents to a recent opinion poll believe the
government's recent launching of daily flight services, direct shipping and
postal links with China is beneficial  to  local  residents  and  will  raise
Taiwan's competitiveness, pollsters said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The results of the survey, however, showed lingering distrust by alarge number
of Taiwanese people toward the Chinese government.</P>
      <P>The survey was supervised by the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
and conducted by the China Credit Information Service between Dec. 19 and Dec.21
with a margin of error of 3 percent. The 1,068 eligible respondents were
composed of Taiwanese adults aged 20-69 accessible through telephone interviews.</P>
      <P>The survey took place after the launching of daily flight services and direct
shipping and postal links between Taiwan and China on Dec.  15 --  the first
time in 60 years that the transportation links were allowed between the two
sides.</P>
      <P>Asked about the improvement in bilateral relations between Taiwan and China,
48.2 percent of the respondents regarded the Chinese government as being
friendly towards Taiwan, but 49.2 percent believed the opposite.</P>
      <P>And while they favor improved ties with China, a vast majority of Taiwanese
people did not favor unification with China, with the survey showing that 91.8
percent of the respondents preferred to maintain  the status quo when asked what
they thought  about independence from or reunification with China.</P>
      <P>"Sixty-one point seven percent of the citizens believe that the agreements
signed with China will have a very positive effect on the economy of Taiwan, "
said Fu Dong- cheng, vice chairman of the MAC during a weekly routine press
conference.</P>
      <P>Fu said that the survey also showed that 54.8 percent of Taiwanese people
believe direct shipping and daily flight services across the Taiwan Strait can
attract more foreign investors to the island.</P>
      <P>Eighty-one percent of the respondents said they would take the daily charter
flight services if they visit China.  Meanwhile, more than 60 percent of the
participants believed cross-Strait relations have improved since last year and
are confident that President Ma Ying-jeou's administration has done a good job
in maintaining peace and stability in the region.</P>
      <P>"The MAC is glad to see that Taiwanese people have felt a conciliatory trend in
cross-Strait relations, and believe that such a trend will serve the foundation
of a peaceful development in the region," said Fu.</P>
      <P>Since the Kuomintang (KMT) returned to power in May, Ma's administration has
been working to melt the ice between the two sides of the strait and forge links
with China, particularly in the economic front.</P>
      <P>In their second round of talks held in Taipei from Nov. 3-7, Taiwan's Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung, and his counterpart Chen
Yunlin of China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) ,
signed four agreements to allow daily direct flights, direct shipping links and
direct postal deliveries, as well as the establishment of a food safety
mechanism between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Chen was the highest-ranking Chinese official to set foot on Taiwan since the
end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. The MAC supervises the operations of the
SEF. The SEF and the ARATS are quasi-official organizations responsible for
handling cross-Strait engagements in the absence of official government-to-
government relations between the two sides of the strait.</P>

      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lee Ching-an announced Thursday that she will
temporarily step down from office and stop receiving her salary until the U.S.
authorities release a "final outcome" of their investigation into her U.S.
citizenship status.</P>
      <P>The decision was made "to prevent any further waste in social resources" as a
result of the controversy, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee claimed that a report on her dual citizenship -- strictly forbidden for
public office-holders -- delivered recently by the American Institute in Taiwan
(AIT) to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on her case is "not final" and urged
the public to wait for the end result before censuring her.</P>
      <P>She was referring to a letter released to the media a day earlier by legislators
from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , in which the U.S. State
Department says Lee "has previously been documented as a U.S. citizen with a
U.S. passport and that no subsequent loss of U.S. citizenship has been
documented."</P>
      <P>Lee's qualification as a legislator has been challenged since it was reported
early this year that she has never officially renounced her U.S. citizenship
even though she has been in public office in Taiwan since 1994.</P>
      <P>The Nationality Act forbids Republic of China nationals with foreign citizenship
from assuming public office and requires those with foreign citizenship to be
removed from their posts.</P>
      <P>Lee admitted that she obtained U.S. citizenship in 1991, but argued that she
lost her status as a U.S. citizen "legally" when she was sworn in as a Taipei
city councilor in 1994, citing U.S. law which lists serving in a foreign
government as one of the legal conditions for the loss of nationality.</P>
      <P>Under pressure from the DPP, the Legislative Yuan requested the MOFA in May to
help verify with foreign governments whether any of the sitting legislators hold
foreign citizenship.</P>
      <P>A reply by the U.S. was received by the MOFA in early December and the letter
was distributed as a classified document to each legislator Wednesday.</P>
      <P>While saying there is no record of loss of U.S. citizenship by Lee, the letter
also states that "U.S. citizens who hold the nationality of a foreign country
and who accept employment with the government of that country that requires an
oath, affirmation or declaration of allegiance may have committed an
expatriating act if they do so with the intent to relinquish their U.S.
nationality."</P>
      <P>"While the Department (of State) has not made any determination regarding loss
of nationality for the individual named above, it could do so based on evidence
that he or she committed a potentially expatriating act with the intention of
relinquishing U.S. nationality. Any such determination would be retroactive to
the date of the expatriating act," the letter reads.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on Lee's claim that the U.S. reply means that her case is still
under review by the U.S. government, a U.S. State Department official told a CNA
correspondent in Washington, D.C. Wednesday that "we cannot comment on the
individual citizenship of any one person."</P>
      <P>However, the official from the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, also said "we now consider this issue closed."</P>
      <P>Also Thursday, the DPP argued that the U.S. reply clearly indicates that Lee
holds U.S. citizenship and demanded that the Legislative Yuan act immediately to
strip her of her legislative post.</P>
      <P>Lee should also surrender salary totaling NT$110 million that she has received
from public office since 1994, according to Lai Ching-te, a whip of the DPP
legislative caucus.</P>

      <P>According to Wang, the CLA is deeply concerned that more workers will lose their
jobs after the Lunar New Year, which falls on January 26 next year.</P>
      <P>"I believe  that the program will help increase  workers' competitive edges and
help stabilize the employment market, " the CLA minister said.</P>
      <P>Private companies participating in the program are required to open courses for
their workers on unpaid leave, while the CLA will offer a subsidy of NT$100
(about US$3) for every hour of training, she said.</P>
      <P>Eligible workers should take at least 24 hours of training per month and will
receive subsidies up to NT$10,000 per month for a maximum period of six months,
she went on.</P>
      <P>Companies are not allowed to dismiss their workers who take part in the program,
Wang added.</P>
      <P>The CLA has estimated that the program will subsidize about 5,600 companies, 600
of which are large enterprises employing over 200 people. It has predicted that
some 168,000 workers will benefit from the measure.</P>
      <P>The program will require a budget totaling NT$15.97 billion in 2009, according
to CLA estimates.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that he supports the inclusion of the
historical truth of comfort women during World War II in textbooks, as it is
part of Taiwan's history.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks at a meeting with eight former Taiwanese comfort women -- a
euphemism for women who were coerced or abducted by the Japanese military and
forced to provide sexual services to its servicemen.</P>
      <P>The eight survivors of Japan's sex-slave system visited Ma in the company of
Kevin Liao, chairman of the Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation, which has long
been striving for justice for the former comfort women.</P>
      <P>The former comfort women, including 92-year-old Wu Hsiou-mei and Chen Tao, aged
87, appealed to Ma that the truth about comfort women be formally included in
history education.</P>
      <P>Ma said he supports their appeal, as accounts of the former Taiwanese comfort
women are also part of Taiwan's history and the mistakes of history should not
be forgotten.</P>
      <P>Ma said the issue of the comfort women is not a racial one but a human rights
issue that also involves other Asian countries overrun by the Japanese. He vowed
to help the victims demand an apology and compensation from the Japanese
government.</P>
      <P>Ma said he has developed deep affection for some of former Taiwanese comfort
women since he started striving for justice for them in 1997, and he added that
he will continue caring about them and providing them with assistance.</P>
      <P>During World War II, the Japanese army kidnapped or coerced at least 400,000
women in China, Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia and the Philippines to satisfy its
soldiers' sexual needs.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the estimated number of victims varies from 1,200 to 2,000, but only
58 have been confirmed by the foundation. Now with an average age of 85, there
are only 20 still alive.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Opening to Chinese performers will be beneficial: GIO</HEADLINE>

      <P>Allowing Chinese entertainers to come to Taiwan to act in TV dramas will
increase jobs opportunities for locals rather than decrease them, Government
Information Office (GIO) Minister Vanessa Yea-ping Shih predicted Thursday.</P>
      <P>Shih made the remarks one day after announcing that the GIO is mapping out a
draft proposal to allow Chinese performers and technicians to work in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The proposed plan to allow a certain number of Chinese actors and technicians
to work on local TV films will not affect the work rights of local performers
and technicians. Instead, it will increase job opportunities," she said.</P>
      <P>She explained that Taiwan has in the past banned Chinese performers and workers
in cross-strait joint-venture TV dramas, resulting in the job opportunities
generated, such as set design or extras, all going to China.</P>
      <P>She also said that the opening will also help upgrade the development of
Taiwan's TV and film industries, saying that if the films are shot in Taiwan,
then it will help promote Taiwanese culture.</P>
      <P>But lawmakers from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party were unconvinced
by Shih's explanation.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Yu Tian said the opening will seriously impact Taiwan's
entertainment circles, especially since many middle-aged and elderly performers
are facing difficulty finding work.</P>
      <P>Yu, an entertainer-turned-lawmaker, suggested that the GIO hold public hearings
and work out complementary measures.</P>
      <P>Two other DPP lawmakers,  Kuan Bi-ling and Chen Ting-fei, questioned whether the
opening to Chinese entertainers is a precursor to Taiwan's opening to Chinese
laborers.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, although President Ma Ying-jeou has said he will not open the
country to Chinese laborers, Chinese entertainers are in fact Chinese laborers.</P>
      <P>"The opening to Chinese entertainers is a water-testing move and if the policy
is adopted, then Chinese laborers will follow, " Chen claimed.</P>
      <P>Shih said the government will first allow Chinese TV actors to enter Taiwan to
work, followed by singers, subject to coordination with the Ministry of
Education and the Immigration Agency, and subject to approval by the Mainland
Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>Opening to Chinese movie actors will require public hearings and will take a
longer time, Shih added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Prosecutors appeal again on ex-president's release</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Prosecutors launched a new bid Thursday to detain former President Chen Shui-
bian ahead of his trial on a raft of corruption charges.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors with the Special Investigation Division (SID) under the Supreme
Prosecutors Office launched the bid by re-appealing to the Taiwan High Court
against the Taipei District Court's Dec. 18 decision to release Chen on his own
recognizance.</P>
      <P>It marked the second time the district court had rejected prosecutors' request
that Chen continue to be detained after he was indicted Dec. 12 on charges of
embezzling government funds and laundering money.</P>
      <P>In their Thursday appeal for Chen's detention, prosecutors said they believe
Chen might flee Taiwan and conspire with witnesses to tamper with or destroy
evidence if he remains free.</P>
      <P>Although National Security Bureau (NSB) personnel are obliged to escort Chen all
day long to protect him, the prosecutors argued that such an escort is not
compulsory and that Chen can easily dodge them.</P>
      <P>For instance, prosecutors argued, Chen answered SID subpoenas July 24 and Aug.
15 in the company of staff members of his office instead of NSB bodyguards.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors asked the Taiwan High Court to hand down a ruling on their
appeal instead of sending the case back to the district court as it did when it
dealt with their previous appeal.</P>
      <P>The high court was expected to make a decision on the appeal the following day.</P>
      <P>In its Dec. 13 ruling, the court ordered that Chen, who was taken into custody
by prosecutors Nov. 12, be released without bail following his indictment along
with 13 other people on charges of embezzlement, corruption and money
laundering. He is Taiwan's first former president to face criminal prosecution.</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife are accused of siphoning off NT$104 million (US$3.12 million)
from a special Presidential Office discretionary fund during his presidency from
2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>They are also charged with accepting bribes worth NT$100 million and NT$200
million in connection with a land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million
in kickbacks to help a contractor win the tender for a government construction
project, according to the indictment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Consumers' Foundation demands probe into high commodity prices</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government should look into why domestic commodity prices have not dropped
significantly to reflect an average 50 percent fall in prices of major raw
materials and grain on the world market, the Consumers' Foundation said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wu Chia-cheng, secretary-general of the Consumers' Foundation, quoted Chicago
Mercantile Exchange data as showing that international prices for soybeans and
wheat have plunged by 48 percent and 56 percent, respectively, from their peaks
recorded earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, Wu said, domestic prices for relevant products, including cooking
oil, flour and bread, have so far not reflected such dramatic falls in
international raw material prices.</P>
      <P>In his view, Wu said, domestic cooking oil prices should be lowered by up to 56
percent and bread prices should be cut by 30 percent.</P>
      <P>Wu urged the Fair Trade Commission and the Executive Yuan's special task force
on commodity price stabilization to launch a thorough probe into the issue and
work out feasible countermeasures.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Cabinet revised regulations governing China visits by government
employees Thursday, greatly relaxing travel restrictions on high-ranking
officials.</P>
      <P>Also amended were regulations concerning Taiwan visits by Chinese professionals
to ease the restrictions for Chinese government officials.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said the liberalization policy will facilitate the
exchanges between the two sides and help Taiwan's civil servants gain an in-
depth understanding of the situation in China, thus contributing positively to
establishing healthy relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Liu pledged that the government will make sure not to undermine Taiwan's
security when promoting the policy.</P>
      <P>The revised regulations will take effect on the date of their proclamation by
the Ministry of the Interior (MOI).</P>
      <P>They will allow police officers at rank 3 or higher and career civil servants at
grade 11 or higher who have no access to state secrets to visit China for any
purposes, including official business and pleasure, after obtaining permission
from a screening committee under the MOI, said Deputy Minister of the Interior
Lin Join-sane.</P>
      <P>For political appointees, local government chiefs and ordinary civil servants
with access to state secrets, they can visit China for any purpose other than
pleasure, after obtaining permission from the MOI's screening committee, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>Political appointees are currently only allowed to visit China for international
conferences or activities, and local government chiefs can only do so to take
part in conferences related to their work.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin said, the China travel ban on officials engaging in "special
services with access to state secrets" will remain to uphold national security
and interests, meaning that they are strictly  forbidden  from visiting  China
unless given special permission.</P>
      <P>These officials include personnel posted overseas, personnel engaging in the
research and development of defense or secret technologies, as well as staff of
the National Security Bureau, the Ministry  of National  Defense  and  the
Ministry  of Justice Investigation Bureau.</P>
      <P>For civil servants at grade 10 or lower, they will be able to visit China after
gaining the approval of the agencies they serve and will no longer be required
to apply for permission with the MOI, Lin said.</P>
      <P>On visits to Taiwan by Chinese officials, the revised regulations will allow
them to come to Taiwan for exchange activities at the invitation of a local
authority, a central government agency or the semi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Chinese officials are currently permitted to visit Taiwan only in a private
capacity and if they are invited by a school or civil organization in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Foreign aid to be transparent, professional, sustainable: MOFA</HEADLINE>

(by Jian Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that the principles of
transparency and professionalism, along with the global goal of sustainable
development, will be the pillars of its foreign aid policy, which will be laid
out in a white paper to be released in January.</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-bin, director-general of the MOFA's Department of Economic  and Trade
Affairs,  said at a press briefing  that transparency and professionalism  are
pivotal to enhancing the effectiveness of Taiwan's overseas aid.</P>
      <P>The ministry has therefore slashed its annual budget for secret diplomacy to
NT$3.8 billion (US$115.15 million) for next year, down by NT$2 billion from the
previous fiscal year, he said. This decision is also in line with the
Legislative Yuan's request to gradually reduce the amount of non-transparent
diplomatic funds, he added.</P>
      <P>In addition, Shih said, the government will help Taiwan's diplomatic allies to
achieve sustainable development through the transfer of Taiwan's expertise in
various fields, as part of its efforts to help realize the United Nations'
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).</P>
      <P>For instance,  techniques  passed on by Taiwan's  overseas agricultural teams
could help relieve extreme hunger and poverty in some areas of countries that
have diplomatic ties with Taiwan, he said. Also, the dispatch of mobile medical
missions would also assist those allies that are fighting against infectious
diseases and help to reduce infant mortality rates, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Shih said, Taiwan will also strengthen cooperation with relevant
international financial institutions, such as the Asian Development Bank, the
Central American Bank for Economic Integration, and the Inter-American
Development Bank.</P>
      <P>He made particular mention of possible cooperation schemes with Australia and
New Zealand to implement aid programs in the South Pacific region, adding that
the government will cooperate with relevant domestic non-governmental
organizations and the private sector to help with its aid programs.</P>

      <P>Taiwan spent NT$331.4 billion (US$10 billion) on research and development in
2007, accounting for 2.62</P>
      <P>percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for the year, a National
Science Council (NSC) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Citing results of the National Science and Technology Survey conducted by the
NSC, the council's Deputy Minister Chen Cheng-hong said the spending marked a
continuous increase for the past five years.</P>
      <P>Still, Taiwan's spending on R&amp;D fell behind its major competitor in the
high-tech field -- South Korea, whose R&amp;D spending accounted for 3.23
percent of its GDP last year.</P>
      <P>The results  also showed that Taiwanese  private  sectors' investment in
research and development increased every year since 2003. It accounted for more
than 70 percent of the national level for 2007, while the government's
investment did not increase by much, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan had 6,128 patent applications approved in the United States in
2007, dropping one notch to rank fifth place in the world and trailing behind
South Korea for the first time, according to Chen, who was also quoting the
survey results. Taiwan ranked fourth place in 2006.  In terms of the Science
Citation Index - an index of how often scientific papers from various countries
are cited, Taiwan ranked 15th in the world, up two notches from the level a year
earlier. Each research paper was cited 3.05 times, up from 2.92 times in 2006,
Chen said. Meanwhile, Taiwan ranked the ninth in terms of the number of research
papers covered in the Engineering Index, up two notches from the previous year,
Chen said. The index is a comprehensive bibliographic  database of engineering

      <P>Seedlings of the official city tree of China's southeastern city of Nanjing,
cedrus deodara, are expected to be planted in Taipei County sometime next year,
a county government source said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Paperwork pertaining to quarantine and exports of the seedlings is currently in
the pipeline in Nanjing City for the shipment of several thousand seedlings of
the conifer, as well as other trees, to Taipei County -- the largest and most
populous administrative district in Taiwan -- said Chen Yuan-chuan, a division
chief of the Taipei County Bureau of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,000 seedlings of cedrus deodara, 3,000 willow seedlings and 100
plum seedlings that the Nanjing city government promised to Taipei County are
expected to be delivered once Nanjing city  officials  complete  the  quarantine
paperwork  and the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture approves the imports,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>Taipei Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei visited Nanjing in July to promote two-way
tourism and cultural exchanges, during which he signed a memorandum of
understanding with Nanjing Mayor Jiang Hongkun and the city's Communist Party
leader Zhu Shanlu aimed at enhancing bilateral exchanges and cooperation.</P>
      <P>A botanist and a Nanjing city government official visited Taiwan recently to
probe the feasibility of the donation and gain a better understanding of the
suitability of Taipei County to grow the seedlings, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>After consulting with the botanist, the county government decided to first
cultivate the seedlings at a nursery in the county's Sansia township and to
eventually transplant the trees at Bitan, in Taipei City's southern outskirts.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The offshore Kinmen County urged the central government Thursday to allow it to
open an office in Xiamen in China's Fujian Province, so as to better serve
Taiwanese people, especially those traveling between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Lin Chen-chia, director of the county's tourism bureau, suggested the central
government in Taipei face up to the fast-growing direct ferry services
maintained between Kinmen and Xiamen since January 2001 -- popularly known as
the "mini three links" which are also put in place between Taiwan-held Matsu
Island and Fujian's Mawei port.</P>
      <P>The number of passengers using the Kinmen-Xiamen mini links reached nearly one
million this year, an astounding jump from the 21,500 in the first year the
links were opened, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Kinmen authorities are particularly keen on opening an office to serve Kinmen
people in Xiamen given that more than 20,000 county residents are residing
there, he said.</P>
      <P>Now that direct air, shipping and postal links have also been put in place
between Taiwan proper and China this month, Lin suggested the central government
retool its current policy which bans city and county authorities from setting up
offices in China.</P>
      <P>Doing so will help boost exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Several cities and counties in Taiwan have expressed an interest in setting up
representative offices in China. Lin proposed the central government first allow
Kinmen County and Lienchiang County of Matsu Island to do so, due to their
proximities to China.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Wednesday that Taiwan's
local governments are prohibited from opening offices in China because there is
no legal basis for such a practice.</P>
      <P>A ban on local governments opening offices in China has pushed some cities and
counties to create special units or form task forces to deal with issues arising
from growing cross-strait activities. Some local authorities are also
considering setting up de facto representative offices in China through farmers'
associations or other trade or tourism-related groups.</P>

      <P>The government's policy of promoting "green" technology has helped generate
economic benefits of over NT$6 billion (about US$182 million) so far this year,
according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Industrial Development Bureau
(IDB).</P>
      <P>IDB officials noted Thursday that the government will integrate more resources

      <P>The year "2009" and the English wording "Taiwan" embedded in huge hearts will be
lit up during the New Year's Eve fireworks display on the facade of Taipei 101,
one of the highest skyscrapers in the world, an official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Steven Kuo Su, deputy director-general of the Tourism Bureau, announced this
year's design at a news conference, adding that the Tourism Bureau, the Ministry
of Economic Affairs and Chunghwa Telecom Co., Ltd. together won the bid for the
right to stage the display.</P>
      <P>"The spectacular fireworks display at Taipei 101 has become one of the best ways
to promote tourism and raise Taiwan's international profile," said Kuo.</P>
      <P>He noted that last year, 75 television networks in 26 countries broadcast

that the word "Taiwan" embedded in four hearts will be displayed on the facade
of Taipei 101, symbolizing "embracing Taiwan with great love."</P>
      <P>Appearing in green, red, blue and yellow, Chen said the four hearts also
represent sustainability,  happiness,  openness and friendliness, adding that
the various colors mean that everyone should tolerate each other's differences
to welcome in 2009.</P>

      <P>Two mobile medical missions Taiwan sent to Guatemala and Haiti, respectively, to
help deal with the aftermath of natural disasters in those allied countries
"caused sensation, " the International Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF)
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>As the mission to Guatemala reached out to several "very remote rural
settlements to which even the country's own medical staff would not go, " it was
very much welcomed by the local residents, ICDF Secretary-General Chen Lien-gene
told a press conference.</P>
      <P>He said the 10-member mission,  consisting  of physicians, surgeons, pharmacists
and nurses from the Taipei Medical University Hospital, visited eight towns in
the provinces of Izabal and Chiquimula during its two-week stay in the Central

      <P>The mission provided much-needed medical assistance and supplies, benefiting
around 3,000 people, in the wake of widespread flooding and landslides caused by
a week of incessant rain in October, Chen went on.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan's first mobile medical mission to Haiti also provided
medical care to around 2,650 people who suffered from recent disasters in the
capital, Port-au-Prince, Chen added.</P>
      <P>A series of devastating storms killed nearly 800 Haitians and left hundreds
injured in the August-September  period,  while approximately 500 students and
teachers perished when a school in Port-au-Prince collapsed in November.</P>
      <P>Chen disclosed that including these two medical missions, the ICDF has
dispatched 18 missions, comprising 165 medical staff, to 13 countries this year,
helping around 30,000 people.</P>
      <P>The ICDF is tasked by the government with providing technical assistance,
investment and loans, international human resources and humanitarian aid to
countries in need, whether or not they have diplomatic relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ICDF sent its first mobile medical mission to northern India in December
2005 and as of the end of 2007, had dispatched a total of 32 medical teams
overseas.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Free public bus rides to be launched on Penghu</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  25 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Free public bus rides will be available from Jan. 1 for all registered residents
of the offshore Penghu County, the Penghu county government announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>Penghu Magistrate Wang Chien-fa encouraged residents to use the free buses
instead of using their cars or motorbikes, to help reduce carbon dioxide
emissions.</P>
      <P>The county  government  recently  allocated  NT$20  million (US$606,060)  to
support the initiative  after several  county councilors proposed that the
county government should provide its residents with better social welfare
programs and help promote environmental protection awareness, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Students on Penghu have been allowed to ride the public buses free of charge
from Dec. 1.</P>
      <P>Penghu is one of the very few counties in the country to provide its residents
with free buses.</P>
      <P>The outlying island of Kinmen was the first county to do so eight years ago
after the Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Inc. -- the island's cash cow -- regularly paid
huge amounts of taxes to the county government, which in turn spent the money on
improving welfare programs for the people there.</P>
      <P>The number of registered Kinmen residents stands at about 80,000, but only
around 40,000 to 50,000 people regularly reside there.</P>
      <P>Penghu's population stands at around 91,000, but the number of those who
regularly use public buses is no more than 50,000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Majority of Taiwanese welcome China links, but suspect China: poll</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  25 (CNA)
12/25/08  21:29:01
(By Luis Yu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than two-thirds of respondents to a recent opinion poll believe the
government's recent launching of daily flight services, direct shipping and
postal links with China is beneficial  to  local  residents  and  will  raise
Taiwan's competitiveness, pollsters said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The results of the survey, however, showed lingering distrust by alarge number
of Taiwanese people toward the Chinese government.</P>
      <P>The survey was supervised by the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
and conducted by the China Credit Information Service between Dec. 19 and Dec.21
with a margin of error of 3 percent. The 1,068 eligible respondents were
composed of Taiwanese adults aged 20-69 accessible through telephone interviews.</P>
      <P>The survey took place after the launching of daily flight services and direct
shipping and postal links between Taiwan and China on Dec.  15 --  the first
time in 60 years that the transportation links were allowed between the two
sides.</P>
      <P>Asked about the improvement in bilateral relations between Taiwan and China,
48.2 percent of the respondents regarded the Chinese government as being
friendly towards Taiwan, but 49.2 percent believed the opposite.</P>
      <P>And while they favor improved ties with China, a vast majority of Taiwanese
people did not favor unification with China, with the survey showing that 91.8
percent of the respondents preferred to maintain  the status quo when asked what
they thought  about independence from or reunification with China.</P>
      <P>"Sixty-one point seven percent of the citizens believe that the agreements
signed with China will have a very positive effect on the economy of Taiwan, "
said Fu Dong- cheng, vice chairman of the MAC during a weekly routine press
conference.</P>
      <P>Fu said that the survey also showed that 54.8 percent of Taiwanese people
believe direct shipping and daily flight services across the Taiwan Strait can
attract more foreign investors to the island.</P>
      <P>Eighty-one percent of the respondents said they would take the daily charter
flight services if they visit China.  Meanwhile, more than 60 percent of the
participants believed cross-Strait relations have improved since last year and
are confident that President Ma Ying-jeou's administration has done a good job
in maintaining peace and stability in the region.</P>
      <P>"The MAC is glad to see that Taiwanese people have felt a conciliatory trend in
cross-Strait relations, and believe that such a trend will serve the foundation
of a peaceful development in the region," said Fu.</P>
      <P>Since the Kuomintang (KMT) returned to power in May, Ma's administration has
been working to melt the ice between the two sides of the strait and forge links
with China, particularly in the economic front.</P>
      <P>In their second round of talks held in Taipei from Nov. 3-7, Taiwan's Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung, and his counterpart Chen
Yunlin of China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) ,
signed four agreements to allow daily direct flights, direct shipping links and
direct postal deliveries, as well as the establishment of a food safety
mechanism between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Chen was the highest-ranking Chinese official to set foot on Taiwan since the
end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. The MAC supervises the operations of the
SEF. The SEF and the ARATS are quasi-official organizations responsible for
handling cross-Strait engagements in the absence of official government-to-
government relations between the two sides of the strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT lawmaker takes voluntary suspension over citizenship dispute</HEADLINE>

      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lee Ching-an announced Thursday that she will
temporarily step down from office and stop receiving her salary until the U.S.
authorities release a "final outcome" of their investigation into her U.S.
citizenship status.</P>
      <P>The decision was made "to prevent any further waste in social resources" as a
result of the controversy, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee claimed that a report on her dual citizenship -- strictly forbidden for
public office-holders -- delivered recently by the American Institute in Taiwan
(AIT) to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on her case is "not final" and urged
the public to wait for the end result before censuring her.</P>
      <P>She was referring to a letter released to the media a day earlier by legislators
from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , in which the U.S. State
Department says Lee "has previously been documented as a U.S. citizen with a
U.S. passport and that no subsequent loss of U.S. citizenship has been
documented."</P>
      <P>Lee's qualification as a legislator has been challenged since it was reported
early this year that she has never officially renounced her U.S. citizenship
even though she has been in public office in Taiwan since 1994.</P>
      <P>The Nationality Act forbids Republic of China nationals with foreign citizenship
from assuming public office and requires those with foreign citizenship to be
removed from their posts.</P>
      <P>Lee admitted that she obtained U.S. citizenship in 1991, but argued that she
lost her status as a U.S. citizen "legally" when she was sworn in as a Taipei
city councilor in 1994, citing U.S. law which lists serving in a foreign
government as one of the legal conditions for the loss of nationality.</P>
      <P>Under pressure from the DPP, the Legislative Yuan requested the MOFA in May to
help verify with foreign governments whether any of the sitting legislators hold
foreign citizenship.</P>
      <P>A reply by the U.S. was received by the MOFA in early December and the letter
was distributed as a classified document to each legislator Wednesday.</P>
      <P>While saying there is no record of loss of U.S. citizenship by Lee, the letter
also states that "U.S. citizens who hold the nationality of a foreign country
and who accept employment with the government of that country that requires an
oath, affirmation or declaration of allegiance may have committed an
expatriating act if they do so with the intent to relinquish their U.S.
nationality."</P>
      <P>"While the Department (of State) has not made any determination regarding loss
of nationality for the individual named above, it could do so based on evidence
that he or she committed a potentially expatriating act with the intention of
relinquishing U.S. nationality. Any such determination would be retroactive to
the date of the expatriating act," the letter reads.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on Lee's claim that the U.S. reply means that her case is still
under review by the U.S. government, a U.S. State Department official told a CNA
correspondent in Washington, D.C. Wednesday that "we cannot comment on the
individual citizenship of any one person."</P>
      <P>However, the official from the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, also said "we now consider this issue closed."</P>
      <P>Also Thursday, the DPP argued that the U.S. reply clearly indicates that Lee
holds U.S. citizenship and demanded that the Legislative Yuan act immediately to
strip her of her legislative post.</P>
      <P>Lee should also surrender salary totaling NT$110 million that she has received
from public office since 1994, according to Lai Ching-te, a whip of the DPP
legislative caucus.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In a bid to help workers forced to take unpaid leave amid the current economic
recession, those who take part in an on-the-job  training program will be
subsidized by the government, Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Minister Wang Ju-
hsuan announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>The program is slated to kick off in February and will provide participating
workers with extra monetary  assistance  and an opportunity to sharpen their
professional skills while forced to take their unpaid leave, Wang said, adding
that Premier Liu Chao-shiuan has promised to back up the plan.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the CLA is deeply concerned that more workers will lose their
jobs after the Lunar New Year, which falls on January 26 next year.</P>
      <P>"I believe  that the program will help increase  workers' competitive edges and
help stabilize the employment market, " the CLA minister said.</P>
      <P>Private companies participating in the program are required to open courses for
their workers on unpaid leave, while the CLA will offer a subsidy of NT$100
(about US$3) for every hour of training, she said.</P>
      <P>Eligible workers should take at least 24 hours of training per month and will
receive subsidies up to NT$10,000 per month for a maximum period of six months,
she went on.</P>
      <P>Companies are not allowed to dismiss their workers who take part in the program,
Wang added.</P>
      <P>The CLA has estimated that the program will subsidize about 5,600 companies, 600
of which are large enterprises employing over 200 people. It has predicted that
some 168,000 workers will benefit from the measure.</P>
      <P>The program will require a budget totaling NT$15.97 billion in 2009, according
to CLA estimates.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that he supports the inclusion of the
historical truth of comfort women during World War II in textbooks, as it is
part of Taiwan's history.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks at a meeting with eight former Taiwanese comfort women -- a
euphemism for women who were coerced or abducted by the Japanese military and
forced to provide sexual services to its servicemen.</P>
      <P>The eight survivors of Japan's sex-slave system visited Ma in the company of
Kevin Liao, chairman of the Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation, which has long
been striving for justice for the former comfort women.</P>
      <P>The former comfort women, including 92-year-old Wu Hsiou-mei and Chen Tao, aged
87, appealed to Ma that the truth about comfort women be formally included in
history education.</P>
      <P>Ma said he supports their appeal, as accounts of the former Taiwanese comfort
women are also part of Taiwan's history and the mistakes of history should not
be forgotten.</P>
      <P>Ma said the issue of the comfort women is not a racial one but a human rights
issue that also involves other Asian countries overrun by the Japanese. He vowed
to help the victims demand an apology and compensation from the Japanese
government.</P>
      <P>Ma said he has developed deep affection for some of former Taiwanese comfort
women since he started striving for justice for them in 1997, and he added that
he will continue caring about them and providing them with assistance.</P>
      <P>During World War II, the Japanese army kidnapped or coerced at least 400,000
women in China, Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia and the Philippines to satisfy its
soldiers' sexual needs.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the estimated number of victims varies from 1,200 to 2,000, but only
58 have been confirmed by the foundation. Now with an average age of 85, there
are only 20 still alive.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Opening to Chinese performers will be beneficial: GIO</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Allowing Chinese entertainers to come to Taiwan to act in TV dramas will
increase jobs opportunities for locals rather than decrease them, Government
Information Office (GIO) Minister Vanessa Yea-ping Shih predicted Thursday.</P>
      <P>Shih made the remarks one day after announcing that the GIO is mapping out a
draft proposal to allow Chinese performers and technicians to work in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The proposed plan to allow a certain number of Chinese actors and technicians
to work on local TV films will not affect the work rights of local performers
and technicians. Instead, it will increase job opportunities," she said.</P>
      <P>She explained that Taiwan has in the past banned Chinese performers and workers
in cross-strait joint-venture TV dramas, resulting in the job opportunities
generated, such as set design or extras, all going to China.</P>
      <P>She also said that the opening will also help upgrade the development of
Taiwan's TV and film industries, saying that if the films are shot in Taiwan,
then it will help promote Taiwanese culture.</P>
      <P>But lawmakers from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party were unconvinced
by Shih's explanation.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Yu Tian said the opening will seriously impact Taiwan's
entertainment circles, especially since many middle-aged and elderly performers
are facing difficulty finding work.</P>
      <P>Yu, an entertainer-turned-lawmaker, suggested that the GIO hold public hearings
and work out complementary measures.</P>
      <P>Two other DPP lawmakers,  Kuan Bi-ling and Chen Ting-fei, questioned whether the
opening to Chinese entertainers is a precursor to Taiwan's opening to Chinese
laborers.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, although President Ma Ying-jeou has said he will not open the
country to Chinese laborers, Chinese entertainers are in fact Chinese laborers.</P>
      <P>"The opening to Chinese entertainers is a water-testing move and if the policy
is adopted, then Chinese laborers will follow, " Chen claimed.</P>
      <P>Shih said the government will first allow Chinese TV actors to enter Taiwan to
work, followed by singers, subject to coordination with the Ministry of
Education and the Immigration Agency, and subject to approval by the Mainland
Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>Opening to Chinese movie actors will require public hearings and will take a
longer time, Shih added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Prosecutors launched a new bid Thursday to detain former President Chen Shui-
bian ahead of his trial on a raft of corruption charges.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors with the Special Investigation Division (SID) under the Supreme
Prosecutors Office launched the bid by re-appealing to the Taiwan High Court
against the Taipei District Court's Dec. 18 decision to release Chen on his own
recognizance.</P>
      <P>It marked the second time the district court had rejected prosecutors' request
that Chen continue to be detained after he was indicted Dec. 12 on charges of
embezzling government funds and laundering money.</P>
      <P>In their Thursday appeal for Chen's detention, prosecutors said they believe
Chen might flee Taiwan and conspire with witnesses to tamper with or destroy
evidence if he remains free.</P>
      <P>Although National Security Bureau (NSB) personnel are obliged to escort Chen all
day long to protect him, the prosecutors argued that such an escort is not
compulsory and that Chen can easily dodge them.</P>
      <P>For instance, prosecutors argued, Chen answered SID subpoenas July 24 and Aug.
15 in the company of staff members of his office instead of NSB bodyguards.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors asked the Taiwan High Court to hand down a ruling on their
appeal instead of sending the case back to the district court as it did when it
dealt with their previous appeal.</P>
      <P>The high court was expected to make a decision on the appeal the following day.</P>
      <P>In its Dec. 13 ruling, the court ordered that Chen, who was taken into custody
by prosecutors Nov. 12, be released without bail following his indictment along
with 13 other people on charges of embezzlement, corruption and money
laundering. He is Taiwan's first former president to face criminal prosecution.</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife are accused of siphoning off NT$104 million (US$3.12 million)
from a special Presidential Office discretionary fund during his presidency from
2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>They are also charged with accepting bribes worth NT$100 million and NT$200
million in connection with a land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million
in kickbacks to help a contractor win the tender for a government construction
project, according to the indictment.</P>

      <P>The government should look into why domestic commodity prices have not dropped
significantly to reflect an average 50 percent fall in prices of major raw
materials and grain on the world market, the Consumers' Foundation said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wu Chia-cheng, secretary-general of the Consumers' Foundation, quoted Chicago
Mercantile Exchange data as showing that international prices for soybeans and
wheat have plunged by 48 percent and 56 percent, respectively, from their peaks
recorded earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, Wu said, domestic prices for relevant products, including cooking
oil, flour and bread, have so far not reflected such dramatic falls in
international raw material prices.</P>
      <P>In his view, Wu said, domestic cooking oil prices should be lowered by up to 56
percent and bread prices should be cut by 30 percent.</P>
      <P>Wu urged the Fair Trade Commission and the Executive Yuan's special task force
on commodity price stabilization to launch a thorough probe into the issue and
work out feasible countermeasures.</P>

managing affairs related to the "mini three links."

Confucius' lesson of the day: "A gentleman never competes in anything he does,
except perhaps in archery. But even then, when he wins he courteously makes his
bow before he advances to take his place among the winners; and, when he has
lost, he walks down and drinks his cup of forfeit. Thus, even in this case of
competition, he shows himself to be a gentleman."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In a bid to help workers forced to take unpaid leave amid the current economic
recession, those who take part in an on-the-job  training program will be
subsidized by the government, Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Minister Wang Ju-
hsuan announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>The program is slated to kick off in February and will provide participating
workers with extra monetary  assistance  and an opportunity to sharpen their
professional skills while forced to take their unpaid leave, Wang said, adding
that Premier Liu Chao-shiuan has promised to back up the plan.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the CLA is deeply concerned that more workers will lose their
jobs after the Lunar New Year, which falls on January 26 next year.</P>
      <P>"I believe  that the program will help increase  workers' competitive edges and
help stabilize the employment market, " the CLA minister said.</P>
      <P>Private companies participating in the program are required to open courses for
their workers on unpaid leave, while the CLA will offer a subsidy of NT$100
(about US$3) for every hour of training, she said.</P>
      <P>Eligible workers should take at least 24 hours of training per month and will
receive subsidies up to NT$10,000 per month for a maximum period of six months,
she went on.</P>
      <P>Companies are not allowed to dismiss their workers who take part in the program,
Wang added.</P>
      <P>The CLA has estimated that the program will subsidize about 5,600 companies, 600
of which are large enterprises employing over 200 people. It has predicted that
some 168,000 workers will benefit from the measure.</P>
      <P>The program will require a budget totaling NT$15.97 billion in 2009, according
to CLA estimates.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that he supports the inclusion of the
historical truth of comfort women during World War II in textbooks, as it is
part of Taiwan's history.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks at a meeting with eight former Taiwanese comfort women -- a
euphemism for women who were coerced or abducted by the Japanese military and
forced to provide sexual services to its servicemen.</P>
      <P>The eight survivors of Japan's sex-slave system visited Ma in the company of
Kevin Liao, chairman of the Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation, which has long
been striving for justice for the former comfort women.</P>
      <P>The former comfort women, including 92-year-old Wu Hsiou-mei and Chen Tao, aged
87, appealed to Ma that the truth about comfort women be formally included in
history education.</P>
      <P>Ma said he supports their appeal, as accounts of the former Taiwanese comfort
women are also part of Taiwan's history and the mistakes of history should not
be forgotten.</P>
      <P>Ma said the issue of the comfort women is not a racial one but a human rights
issue that also involves other Asian countries overrun by the Japanese. He vowed
to help the victims demand an apology and compensation from the Japanese
government.</P>
      <P>Ma said he has developed deep affection for some of former Taiwanese comfort
women since he started striving for justice for them in 1997, and he added that
he will continue caring about them and providing them with assistance.</P>
      <P>During World War II, the Japanese army kidnapped or coerced at least 400,000
women in China, Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia and the Philippines to satisfy its
soldiers' sexual needs.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the estimated number of victims varies from 1,200 to 2,000, but only
58 have been confirmed by the foundation. Now with an average age of 85, there

    <TEXT>
      <P>Prosecutors launched a new bid Thursday to detain former President Chen Shui-
bian ahead of his trial on a raft of corruption charges.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors with the Special Investigation Division (SID) under the Supreme
Prosecutors Office launched the bid by re-appealing to the Taiwan High Court
against the Taipei District Court's Dec. 18 decision to release Chen on his own
recognizance.</P>
      <P>It marked the second time the district court had rejected prosecutors' request
that Chen continue to be detained after he was indicted Dec. 12 on charges of
embezzling government funds and laundering money.</P>
      <P>In their Thursday appeal for Chen's detention, prosecutors said they believe
Chen might flee Taiwan and conspire with witnesses to tamper with or destroy
evidence if he remains free.</P>
      <P>Although National Security Bureau (NSB) personnel are obliged to escort Chen all
day long to protect him, the prosecutors argued that such an escort is not
compulsory and that Chen can easily dodge them.</P>
      <P>For instance, prosecutors argued, Chen answered SID subpoenas July 24 and Aug.
15 in the company of staff members of his office instead of NSB bodyguards.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors asked the Taiwan High Court to hand down a ruling on their
appeal instead of sending the case back to the district court as it did when it
dealt with their previous appeal.</P>
      <P>The high court was expected to make a decision on the appeal the following day.</P>
      <P>In its Dec. 13 ruling, the court ordered that Chen, who was taken into custody
by prosecutors Nov. 12, be released without bail following his indictment along
with 13 other people on charges of embezzlement, corruption and money
laundering. He is Taiwan's first former president to face criminal prosecution.</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife are accused of siphoning off NT$104 million (US$3.12 million)
from a special Presidential Office discretionary fund during his presidency from
2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>They are also charged with accepting bribes worth NT$100 million and NT$200
million in connection with a land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million
in kickbacks to help a contractor win the tender for a government construction
project, according to the indictment.</P>

      <P>Allowing Chinese entertainers to come to Taiwan to act in TV dramas will
increase jobs opportunities for locals rather than decrease them, Government
Information Office (GIO) Minister Vanessa Yea-ping Shih predicted Thursday.</P>
      <P>Shih made the remarks one day after announcing that the GIO is mapping out a
draft proposal to allow Chinese performers and technicians to work in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The proposed plan to allow a certain number of Chinese actors and technicians
to work on local TV films will not affect the work rights of local performers
and technicians. Instead, it will increase job opportunities," she said.</P>
      <P>She explained that Taiwan has in the past banned Chinese performers and workers
in cross-strait joint-venture TV dramas, resulting in the job opportunities
generated, such as set design or extras, all going to China.</P>
      <P>She also said that the opening will also help upgrade the development of
Taiwan's TV and film industries, saying that if the films are shot in Taiwan,
then it will help promote Taiwanese culture.</P>
      <P>But lawmakers from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party were unconvinced
by Shih's explanation.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Yu Tian said the opening will seriously impact Taiwan's
entertainment circles, especially since many middle-aged and elderly performers
are facing difficulty finding work.</P>
      <P>Yu, an entertainer-turned-lawmaker, suggested that the GIO hold public hearings
and work out complementary measures.</P>
      <P>Two other DPP lawmakers,  Kuan Bi-ling and Chen Ting-fei, questioned whether the
opening to Chinese entertainers is a precursor to Taiwan's opening to Chinese
laborers.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, although President Ma Ying-jeou has said he will not open the
country to Chinese laborers, Chinese entertainers are in fact Chinese laborers.</P>
      <P>"The opening to Chinese entertainers is a water-testing move and if the policy
is adopted, then Chinese laborers will follow, " Chen claimed.</P>
      <P>Shih said the government will first allow Chinese TV actors to enter Taiwan to
work, followed by singers, subject to coordination with the Ministry of
Education and the Immigration Agency, and subject to approval by the Mainland
Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>Opening to Chinese movie actors will require public hearings and will take a
longer time, Shih added.</P>

      <P>The government should look into why domestic commodity prices have not dropped
significantly to reflect an average 50 percent fall in prices of major raw
materials and grain on the world market, the Consumers' Foundation said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wu Chia-cheng, secretary-general of the Consumers' Foundation, quoted Chicago
Mercantile Exchange data as showing that international prices for soybeans and
wheat have plunged by 48 percent and 56 percent, respectively, from their peaks
recorded earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, Wu said, domestic prices for relevant products, including cooking
oil, flour and bread, have so far not reflected such dramatic falls in
international raw material prices.</P>
      <P>In his view, Wu said, domestic cooking oil prices should be lowered by up to 56
percent and bread prices should be cut by 30 percent.</P>
      <P>Wu urged the Fair Trade Commission and the Executive Yuan's special task force

    <HEADLINE>Build Kinmen into an 'academic island': Taiwanese literati</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 26 (CNA)
12/26/08  13:58:00

    <TEXT>
      <P>Renowned Taiwan-raised modern Chinese poet Cheng Chou-yu called for concerted
efforts Thursday to build the outlying island of Kinmen into an "academic
island" to attract students from both Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Speaking at an academic forum held in Kinmen, Cheng, who teaches at the National
Kinmen Institute of Technology's (NKIT's) General Education Center and Graduate
Institute of Culture and History of South Fujian, urged the Ministry of
Education to help NKIT upgrade into a university that can serve as a bedrock for
developing the former frontline bastion into an oasis of academia.</P>
      <P>Cheng also called for the central government to open Taiwan's doors, including
NKIT, to Chinese students, saying that there are too many young men and women in
China who cannot enter tertiary education institutes because there are too few
such institutes there, while Taiwan's institutes, mostly privately run, have too
many vacancies.</P>
      <P>The poet added that after NKIT is upgraded to a university, he hopes that a
college of general education can be established under the university so that
students from Taiwan and China can travel to Kinmen to receive general education
there for at least a year.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the forum, Control Yuan member Chou Yang-shan, a former
legislator and university professor,  urged Taiwan-based universities to branch
out to Kinmen, in anticipation that Kinmen is poised to become an academic
bridge between China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>NKIT President Lee Chin-chen said that following repeated calls by Kinmen
Magistrate Lee Chu-feng, the Ministry of Education had recently approved the
institute's application to upgrade.</P>
      <P>He said that of NKIT's current 2,200 students, 85 percent are from Taiwan, each
of whom is entitled to receive NT$14,000 (US$424) per person per year as tuition
and transport subsidies.</P>
      <P>"We have allocated a much higher budget -- to the tune of NT$130 million -- for
2009 to induce more students from Taiwan and China to study at NKIT," Lee added.</P>
      <P>Zhuang Zongming, a professor at Xiamen University who doubles as an assistant to
the university's president, said at the forum that the just-launched direct air
and sea links across the Taiwan Strait has opened a new era for both sides.</P>
      <P>"Kinmen and Xiamen, which are located across a narrow channel of water like two
neighboring doors, are now being provided with unlimited  opportunities  for
cultural,  education and business exchanges," Zhuang said.</P>
      <P>Zhuang said that at present, Chinese colleges and universities treat Taiwanese
students the same as local ones, granting them lower tuition charges and
dormitory benefits. He added that "Taiwan can do the same as well."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, writer Lung Ying-tai, a chair professor at the University of Hong
Kong, called for President Ma Ying-jeou to deliver on his campaign promise to
develop Taiwan into an "exporter of Hoklo culture."</P>
      <P>"The Hoklo language, or Taiwanese, which derives from southern Fujian Province,
should not be restricted to being just an ethnic or political tongue, it should
be part of Taiwan's 'soft strength, '" Lung said at the forum.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan should pull out all the stops, including making use of the media, to
develop itself into a Hoklo culture exporter, as there is a market of 50 million
Hoklo-speaking people around the world, " Lung said.</P>
      <P>Hoklo commonly refers to those Taiwanese people who claim Han Chinese ancestry
from the southern part of Fujian Province. It has a large diaspora in Malaysia,
China's Guangdong Province, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Singapore, Burma,
Thailand and Indonesia, where they are usually referred to as Hokkien, meaning
Fujian in the Minnan language.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the Hoklos are the largest ethnic group. Most trace their paternal
ancestry to men who migrated to Taiwan from Fujian in the 17th and 18th
centuries.</P>
      <P>Because about 70 percent of the population in Taiwan are Hoklo, Taiwanese is
often used interchangeably to describe Hoklo.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT legislator urged to prove loss of U.S. citizenship by Jan. 31</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan will see whether ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lee
Ching-an can produce a document certifying the loss of her U.S. citizenship by
Jan. 31 before taking any action against her, Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Wang also said that the legislature is expecting the U.S. authorities to clarify
if Lee lost her U.S. citizenship as early as 1994 when she was first elected to
public office in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks in response to calls by opposition legislators that the
legislature should act immediately to remove Lee from her post, claiming that
she holds U.S. citizenship.</P>
      <P>Lee, who was sworn in to her fourth legislative term Feb. 1, was discovered in
March to have never formally renounced her U.S. citizenship.</P>
      <P>Dual citizenship is strictly forbidden for public office-holders in Taiwan,  and
the Nationality Act requires those with dual nationality renounce their foreign
citizenship before assuming public office and to obtain a certificate testifying
to the loss of citizenship within one year of their inauguration.</P>
      <P>Lee admitted that she obtained U.S. citizenship in 1991, but argued that she
legally lost her status as a U.S. citizen when she was sworn in as a Taipei city
councilor in 1994, citing U.S. law, which lists serving in a foreign government
as one of the legal conditions for possible loss of nationality.</P>
      <P>Replying to Taiwan's inquiry on the citizenship status of sitting legislators,
the U.S. State Department said in a recent letter to the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) that Lee "has previously been documented as a U.S. citizen with a
U.S. passport and that no subsequent loss of U.S. citizenship has been
documented."</P>
      <P>The State Department, however, also says that U.S. citizens serving in a foreign
government "may have committed an expatriating act if they do so with the intent
to relinquish their U.S. nationality."</P>
      <P>"While the Department (of State) has not made any determination regarding loss
of nationality for the individual named above, it could do so based on evidence
that he or she committed a potentially expatriating act with the intention of
relinquishing U.S. nationality. Any such determination would be retroactive to
the date of the expatriating act," the letter reads.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the MOFA thinks the reply means Lee's U.S. citizenship status
is not "ultimately determinative" and has requested that the U.S. side make a
further investigation for a more specific answer.</P>
      <P>A State Department official stated clearly Wednesday that the U.S. government
considers the case closed, but the Legislative Yuan nevertheless passed a
resolution Friday to ask the MOFA to request that the U.S. authorities further
investigate Lee's citizenship status.</P>
      <P>The resolution was adopted without the support of the minority Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) ,  which believes the State Department letter confirms
Lee's status as a U.S. citizen and that there is no excuse for any further delay
in handling the case.</P>
      <P>Kuan Bi-ling, a whip of the DPP legislative caucus, demanded that the Central
Election Commission nullify Lee's four elections as legislator.</P>
      <P>Kuan further demanded that the Ministry of the Interior impose an overseas
travel ban on Lee and that the Ministry of Justice order a provisional seizure
of her assets, adding that if they fail to do so, the DPP will file a complaint
with the relevant authorities against the three agencies.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, former DPP Legislator Chiang Chao-yi, who is an accountant, said
Lee's salaries from public office in Taiwan are taxable income in the United
States and estimated that the tax owed by Lee has exceeded NT$10 million,
including interest.</P>
      <P>In addition to asking for her removal from the legislative post, the DPP is
demanding that Lee surrender salary totaling NT$110 million that she has
received from her public office jobs since 1994.</P>
      <P>In the face of mounting pressure for her to leave, Lee announced Thursday that
she would temporarily step down from office and stop receiving her salary until
the U.S. authorities release a "final outcome" of their investigation into her
U.S. citizenship status.</P>

      <P>Aid programs that Taiwan has launched in two of its diplomatic allies have been
recognized by the World Trade Organization (WTO) as "successful cases of Aid for
Trade, " a non-profit foundation said Friday.</P>
      <P>A program launched in Guatemala to help that nation export papayas and another
launched in Panama to help produce and export safe vegetables and fruit were
cited in a workshop sponsored by the WTO and other global organizations in
October, said Chen Lien-chun, secretary-general of the International Cooperation
and Development Fund (ICDF) under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>The workshop was sponsored by the WTO's Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary
Measures (SPS) , the Standards and Trade Development Facility (STDF) and the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).</P>
      <P>The papaya export program, initiated by a Taiwanese agrotech mission in
Guatemala, is an integrated operation ranging from planting papayas and
quarantine checks to packaging and export promotion, while the safe vegetables
and fruit program, initiated by Taiwan's agrotech mission in Panama, is an
operation that uses technology developed by the mission to detect pesticide and
chemical residues in locally produced vegetables and fruit before the produce is
put on the market, Chen said.</P>
      <P>This technology has also helped Panamanian farmers to export their produce, Chen
went on.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Aid for Trade initiative was first espoused at a WTO
ministerial-level meeting held in Hong Kong in 2005 to give financial aid -- via
multilateral mechanisms such as the WTO and the World Bank -- to help developing
or least-developed countries expand business opportunities and trade prospects.</P>
      <P>Aid for Trade has gradually become the mainstay of official development aid
(ODA) programs worldwide in recent years, and the Aid for Trade programs  that
Taiwan has launched  have also been incorporated into the ODA system as a core
aid strategy, Chen added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's legislature on Friday approved the funding bill for a shopping voucher
program that the government hopes will stimulate consumption and give a lift to
the slumping retail sector.</P>
      <P>The special budget bill passed Friday authorized NT$85.65 billion (US$2.58
billion) for the program, slightly less than the NT$85.702 billion requested by
the government, and permitted the plan to be fully financed by government-issued
debt.</P>
      <P>In approving the bill, the Legislative Yuan left authorities enough time to
print and prepare NT$3,600 in consumption vouchers for all citizens by the
targeted distribution date of Jan. 18, 2009.</P>
      <P>Though the government had most of its requested budget approved, lawmakers cut
proposed spending on the operation of an information platform, bank processing
fees to cash the vouchers, and the cost of contracting state-run Chunghwa Post
Co. to distribute the vouchers.</P>
      <P>The bill included a number of resolutions related to the program, including one
that required that any publicity for the program be free of politically charged
language, advertising, hints, or images.</P>
      <P>Another resolution allowed diplomatic officials posted overseas and their
dependents with Republic of China citizenship to be eligible to receive the
vouchers. They were not originally included the plan because they do not have
household registrations in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The bill also required that college and university students from middle- and
low-income families be hired to help distribute the vouchers.</P>
      <P>Under regulations governing the program approved Dec. 5, all Taiwanese citizens
born before the end of March 2009 who hold valid household registrations are
eligible to receive NT$3,600 in vouchers. They must be used by Sept. 30, 2009.</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of the Interior, the vouchers will be distributed the
same way ballots are handed to eligible voters in national elections. The
vouchers can be picked up in person at designated distribution centers around
the country on Jan. 18 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.</P>
      <P>Those unable to collect their vouchers that day can pick them up at designated
post offices between Feb. 7 and April 30.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAITRA to set up new offices in China to assist Taiwanese companies</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) will set up four new
offices in China to help Taiwanese companies based there shift their focus from
exports to China's domestic market, TAITRA's chairman said Friday.</P>
      <P>Wang Chih-kang,  who became chairman  of the foreign-trade promoting body in
July, announced at a year-end news conference that the agency will add branches
in Guangzhou, Nanjing, Dalian and Wuhan.</P>
      <P>TAITRA already has offices in Beijing, Shanghai,  Qingdao, Chengdu, and Xiamen.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan's exports battered by the global economic downturn, Wang said his
agency's two main missions for the coming year will be to help Taiwanese
companies tap into China's domestic demand and shift Taiwan's target markets
from Europe and the United States to emerging markets, such as Russia, the
Middle East and Central and South America.</P>
      <P>"TAITRA has only one goal and that is to expand exports, " Wang said. "Expanding
domestic demand is important, but expanding foreign demand is even more
important, especially the market in China."</P>
      <P>Wang noted that Taiwan recorded a trade surplus of US$13 billion in the first 11
months of 2008 despite the weak global economy, but warned that surplus had
fallen 48 percent from the same period a year earlier.</P>
      <P>"This is a scary number that worries us very much," he said.</P>
      <P>Although they represent only a small portion of Taiwan's overall trade, emerging
markets such as Russia, Central and South America, and Islamic countries are
full of potential, Wang said, and will be key targets of TAITRA's trade-
promotion efforts.</P>
      <P>Wang cited as a source of his optimism the growth in exports to these emerging
markets from July to November, when the worldwide financial tsunami hit the
hardest.</P>
      <P>Total exports to the markets totaled US$360 million during the period, with
shipments to Brazil and Saudi Arabia growing by 91.93 and 84.01 percent,
respectively, year-on-year.</P>
      <P>"This indeed greatly boosted our confidence, " Wang said, adding that TAITRA has
already deployed staff in these countries to handle related business.</P>
      <P>Founded in 1970 to help promote foreign trade, TAITRA is a non- profit trade
promotion organization in Taiwan jointly sponsored by the government,  industry
associations,  and several commercial organizations.</P>

      <P>A Sichuan Airlines flight, carrying 87 passengers, landed at Taipei Songshan
Airport from Chengdu Friday afternoon, the first direct nonstop passenger
charter from Sichuan to Taiwan since air links between Taiwan and China were
expanded on Dec. 15.</P>
      <P>The Sichuan Airlines  flight,  an Airbus A320 single-aisle jetliner, was piloted
by Captain Chang Lu-chen, a native Taiwanese who formerly worked for Taiwan's
TransAsia Airways, according to the Chengdu-based carrier.</P>
      <P>The inaugural A320 flight was dubbed "Gan En,  " meaning "gratitude, " and had
characters reading "Sichuan's people thank Taiwan compatriots for their
unselfish aid following the May 12 earthquake" painted on the body of the
aircraft.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's people donated huge sums of money to help Sichuan respond to and
recover from the devastating magnitude 8.0 earthquake that struck the province
in mid-May.</P>
      <P>Most of the flight attendants were dressed in attire worn by China's indigenous
peoples. Two others donned giant panda cartoon dresses, in recognition of the
pair of pandas that arrived in Taipei from Sichuan Dec. 23 as tokens of China's
friendship.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the menu on the flight included twice-cooked pork, the most popular
Sichuan dish, and san-bei chicken, one of the most representative Taiwanese

      <P>The Taipei City Government and several enterprises donated tickets Friday to
underprivileged children and art students to see the world renowned Cirque du
Soleil, which will perform in Taiwan for the first time early next year.</P>
      <P>Before main the event, the entertainment company will perform the show "Alegria"
on January 13, mainly for about 800 underprivileged people.</P>
      <P>"In these times of economic hardship, the donation of tickets is truly an
encouragement (to underprivileged children)," said Yang Jen-feng, who
represented the United Daily News Group, the main organizer of the Taipei tour
by the Canadian company. Among other sponsors, the Taipei City Government
donated 520 tickets to children from orphanages and halfway houses.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based Chinatrust Charity Foundation also invited 60 children, who
have long-term sponsorship, to see the show.</P>
      <P>A financial institution, the ING Group, donated 50 tickets for online auction
and the proceeds will be used to pay for underprivileged children to attend the
show.</P>
      <P>Also, Far Eastern Group, one of the sponsors of Cirque du Soleil's tour of
Taipei, will invite around 100 dance and theater students from low-income
households to attend the performance.</P>
      <P>The Quebec-based Cirque du Soleil is scheduled to perform its classic show
"Alegria " -- Spanish for 'joy' -- in January and February next year in Taipei.
The company's shows usually feature acrobatics and dazzling costumes that are
the hallmark of top notch circus performances, but also incorporate a wide
element of theater.</P>

      <P>Taiwan Beer, the leading beer brand in Taiwan, will be marketed in China next
year, the Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corp. (TTLC) said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to TTLC Chairman Wei Po-tao, Chinese authorities have completed
screening of Taiwan Beer's application for trademark registration and will
announce its official approval of the trademark on Feb. 6.</P>
      <P>Wei predicted that the new market will help increase the beer's total sales by
10 percent, or NT$3 billion, next year.</P>
      <P>As of the end of November 2008, Taiwan Beer had seized an 81 percent share of
Taiwan's beer market, with its revenue expected to reach NT$26 billion for the
year, Wei said.</P>
      <P>TTLC President Hsu An-hsuan said that in the initial stage, Taiwan Beer's
marketing in China will focus on canned products exported directly from Taiwan
and will target consumers in the southern provinces of Fujian and Guangdong,
whose food preferences are similar to those of Taiwanese consumers.</P>
      <P>In the future, the company will develop various beer flavors to cater to the
preferences of local consumers in southern China, central China and northern
China, and will outsource the production to Chinese manufacturers or establish
partnership with them, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>According to the TTLC, the beer will have the same packaging in China as it does
in Taiwan, except that simplified Chinese characters will be used on the labels.</P>

      <P>Three social welfare foundations that usually organize a year-end dinner for the
homeless and other underprivileged people, said Friday that in light the
hardships brought on by the current economic slump, they will increase the
number of table places to 12,000.</P>
      <P>Wu Wan-lan, who heads the department of social resources and public relations of
the Zenan Homeless Social Welfare Foundation, told the Central News Agency that
the foundations plan to provide 1,200 tables at the year-end dinner, which means
it will be almost twice as large as the last one.</P>
      <P>The dinner is usually held at the end of the lunar year, which falls early in
the new year of the Western calendar.</P>
      <P>The Zenan foundation, along with the Huashan Social Welfare Foundation and the
Genesis Social Welfare Foundation, in February 2008 provided 808 tables at which
they seated the needy, the homeless, elderly people who live alone, and people
from low-income households, in a festive atmosphere.</P>
      <P>Due to the increasingly high unemployment rate and general economic downturn, it
is likely that more people will be needing the free dinner that is expected to
be hosted Jan. 24 next year, the day before the Chinese New Year's eve, Wu said.</P>
      <P>She further noted that the number of people who go to the foundation's centers
around the island for free lunches and dinners every day has increased by 20
percent compared to the same period last year.</P>
      <P>"All the new faces are middle-aged and even younger people, " Wu said. "They
have lost their jobs and cannot find another one at the moment."</P>
      <P>Half of those who go to the centers for free meals are jobless, while the rest
are disabled and elderly people, she added.</P>
      <P>The number of needy people in Taiwan is rapidly increasing, she said, citing the
foundation's statistics that showed it provided meals, counselling and
employment services to about 200,000 people at its centers islandwide in 2006,
while from January to October this year the figure was 420,000.</P>
      <P>Wu said that although 60 percent of the funds for the year-end meal has already
been donated by individuals and groups, she is urging people to donate their
shopping vouchers or other resources, such as winter clothes and sleeping bags,
which are indispensable to homeless people in winter.</P>
      <P>The government is launching an 85.6-billion project to distribute shopping
vouchers to all Taiwan citizens on January 18 next year, in the hope of
stimulating consumption and boosting economic growth. Taiwan citizens and their
foreign spouses will each receive NT$3,600 (US$109) worth of vouchers.</P>
      <P>People who wish to make donations to the charity foundation can call (02)

      <P>A dozen indigenous children from the Atayal tribe were invited Friday to attend
a general education course at National Tsing Hua University in Hsinchu City,  an
experience educators hoped will inspire them to become university students.</P>
      <P>Organized by Tsing Hua University professors Huang Yi-nung and Wang Chun-hsiu
and entering its third year, the charity project is part of their general
education course called "crossing boundaries and exploring, " which aims to
encourage children to take action and pursue their dreams.</P>
      <P>The course consists of a first assignment, a mid-term exam and a final. The
first assignment is a "field trip of life, " in which students have to interview
one of their family members and tell their story based on an old picture.</P>
      <P>The mid-term requires students to pursue a small personal dream, such as
climbing the tallest mountain in Taiwan or talking to a foreigner in English for
two hours.</P>
      <P>The final exam asks a group of five to eight students to accomplish a common
dream, and experiencing life as university students for a day on Friday was one
of the group's dreams.</P>
      <P>Compressing university life into a one-day activity, the Atayal children first
registered and received their student ID and then were joined by university
students to tour the campus, dorms and library, and attend general education
courses and extra-curricular activities.</P>
      <P>At the end of the day, the children received a certificate for their efforts.</P>
      <P>"The children's joy and sense of humor affected our university students and they
actually learned from each other," Wang said.</P>
      <P>He added that this is just a start because an adoption mechanism is being mapped
out for university students to play a role in encouraging indigenous children to

      <P>The monitoring score for Taiwan's economic indicators in November dropped one
point from the previous month to 11 -- the lowest score in nearly seven years,
according to a report released by the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) Friday.</P>
      <P>A blue light continued to flash for the third consecutive month, indicating the
economy is mired in a recession.</P>
      <P>The CEPD uses five colors to measure domestic economic health, with "red"
indicating serious overheating, "yellow-red" for slight overheating, "green" for
steady growth, "yellow-blue" for a slowdown and "blue" for recession.</P>
      <P>The composite index of leading indicators -- a barometer for the economy's
outlook in the coming three months -- fell by 0.8 percent from the previous
month to 110.3.</P>
      <P>Hung Jui-bin, director-general of the CEPD's Economic Research Department,
attributed the worsening results to continuing slumps in external trade,
consumption and financial activities.</P>
      <P>With leading indicators in many industrial  countries also falling, and exports
slumping dramatically, domestic consumption slowing and unemployment rising,
Taiwan will have a hard time extracting itself from the recession in the near

situation, stood at 92.1 in November, down 5.8 percent from the previous month,

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Consultative  Committee of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
said recently that China should, as soon as possible, dismantle its missiles
that are pointed at Taiwan and stop boycotting Taiwan's participation in
international organizations.</P>
      <P>The 169th consultative committee meeting of the MAC on Wednesday agreed that,
alongside the recent closer economic ties forged with China, the Taiwan
government should also find ways to fight for Taiwan's dignity and international
space.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should also urge China to take the initiative to show its willingness to
further improve the bilateral relations between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait, the committee suggested.</P>
      <P>The committee members said that China should understand very well feelings of
the Taiwanese people, and in the interest of further promoting positive
interaction between the two sides, should remove its missiles that are aimed at
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Reports have put the number of ballistic missiles deployed along China's east
coast and targeting Taiwan at more than 1,000.</P>
      <P>Turning to the recent launch of direct air and shipping links between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait, some members of the committee said that the links
should not be seen as a panacea for Taiwan's economic woes.</P>
      <P>In touting the recent economic cooperative efforts between the</P>
      <P>two sides, the Taiwan government should emphasize that they are part of the
process of normalizing bilateral cross-strait ties, the committee members
advised.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ruling party Kuomintang (KMT) and the main opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) should find ways to resolve their differences and reach
some agreement on cross-strait policy, as meaningless debates and accusations
between the two parties will neither win the public's support nor serve the best
interests of Taiwan, the majority of committee members said.</P>
      <P>The committee members urged the MAC not to be swayed by any particular party of
interest group, as its role is to serve as a platform for communication and
negotiations on cross-strait matters.</P>
      <P>However, the MAC also has a role to promote and strengthen interaction between
the ruling and opposition parties in order to be able to design proper and
unbiased policies in the future, the committee said.</P>
      <P>As for the just-concluded forum between the KMT and the Communist Party of China
(PCP), the committee members said that was held in a period of transition and
that the future necessity of a such a forum should be discussed among the ruling
and opposition parties and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).</P>
      <P>NGOs and academics could also be part of a non-official communication channel
between the two sides of the strait, the committee suggested.</P>

      <P>A lawmaker of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) surrendered her party rights Friday,
pending clarification of her dual citizenship issue.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Ching-an informed the KMT in a written notice that effective
immediately, she has temporarily given up her party rights and will refrain from
taking part in any activities of the KMT legislative caucus until the dispute
over her dual citizenship issue is resolved.</P>
      <P>The KMT's head office later confirmed it had received the notice and had agreed
to her decision. It urged the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to contact the U.S.
government to clarify the issue as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In a separate notice to the legislature, Lee said that with immediate  effect,
she will not accept any salary  from the legislature.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng indicated earlier in the day that the
legislature will wait until Jan. 31 to see whether Lee can produce a document
certifying the loss of her U.S. citizenship, before considering the next move.</P>
      <P>Wang said the legislature was expecting U.S. authorities to clarify whether Lee
had lost her U.S. citizenship as early as 1994 when she was first elected to
public office in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The dual citizenship issue surfaced in March with reports that Lee, sworn in to
her fourth legislative term Feb. 1, had never formally renounced her U.S.
citizenship.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Nationality Act requires all public office holders with dual
nationality to renounce their foreign citizenship. Within one year of being
sworn in, they must submit a certificate certifying the loss of their foreign
citizenship, the act stipulates.</P>
      <P>Lee, who obtained U.S. citizenship in 1991, contended that she legally lost her
status as a U.S. citizen when she was first sworn in as a Taipei city councilor
in 1994. She cited U.S. law, which lists serving in a foreign government as one
of the legal conditions for losing U.S. nationality.</P>
      <P>Replying to Taiwan's inquiry on the citizenship status of sitting legislators,
the U.S. State Department said in a recent letter to the foreign ministry that
Lee "has previously been documented as a U.S. citizen with a U.S. passport and
that no subsequent loss of U.S. citizenship has been documented."</P>
      <P>The State Department, however, also said that U.S. citizens serving in a foreign
government "may have committed an expatriating act if they do so with the intent
to relinquish their U.S. nationality."</P>
      <P>"While the Department (of State) has not made any determination regarding loss
of nationality for the individual named above, it could do so based on evidence
that he or she committed a potentially expatriating  act  with  the intention
of relinquishing  U.S. nationality. Any such determination would be retroactive
to the date of the expatriating act," the letter reads.</P>
      <P>Although a State Department official said the U.S. government now considers the
case closed, the Taipei government still sees Lee's U.S. citizenship status as
not "ultimately determinative" and is requesting that the U.S. give a clear-cut
answer.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's economic planning authorities announced Friday that it supports
allowing casinos as part of leisure resorts on the country's outlying islands,
including Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu.</P>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) made the announcement
at its year-end news conference, with CEPD Vice Chairman Huang Wan-hsiang
assessing that the new industry will create approximately 5,000 jobs, and
15,000-25,000 indirect employment opportunities.</P>
      <P>The long debate on whether or not to allow the development of the gambling
business in Taiwan concluded Friday, with the government agreeing that gambling
facilities will be allowed, but only if they are part of a comprehensive leisure
resort.</P>
      <P>According to a government survey conducted in July, 44 percent of the population
support the idea of lifting the ban on casinos while 36 percent oppose it.</P>
      <P>Among the proponents, 44 percent said gambling facilities should be established
only on the outlying islands, while 9 percent said they should also be allowed
on Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>Among the residents on the outlying islands who were polled, 47 percent
expressed support for the proposal, while 36 percent were opposed to it. Among
those in support of the idea, 45 percent said casinos should be allowed on the
outlying islands.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials concluded that the majority of residents on Taiwan proper and on
the outlying islands agree that the islets should be opened to the gambling
business.</P>
      <P>At the press conference, CEPD Chairman Chen Tain-jy said that as soon as
gambling is legalized in the country, the administration will allow casinos to
be established first on the outlying islands.</P>
      <P>An amendment to lift the ban on gambling businesses on the outlying islands is
in a long line of bills backed up in the legislature.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A leading prosecutor of the Special Investigation Division under the Supreme
Prosecutors Office confirmed Friday that his office is looking into allegations
of money laundering by former President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Chen Yun-nan, the chief of the division, said the case has been referred to
prosecutor Lin Che-hui for investigation, in collaboration with other
prosecutors from the division.</P>
      <P>Chen, whose division was catapulted into the limelight when it indicted ex-
President Chen Shui-bian on money-laundering, forgery and corruption charges
Dec. 12, also confirmed news reports that the most recent probe resulted from
information provided by Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>In testimony given Sept. 5 to the Taipei Prosecutors Office in its investigation
of former Investigation Bureau Chief Yeh Sheng-mao, Chen Shui-bian reportedly
claimed that his predecessor Lee had engaged in money laundering while in
office.</P>
      <P>Chen Shiu-bian said Lee has used the bank accounts of at least four bodyguards
to launder US$56 million.</P>
      <P>As Lee is a former head of state, the information was referred to the Special
Investigation Division which is responsible for investigations involving senior
officials.</P>
      <P>Yeh was sentenced to 10 years in prison by the Taipei District Court on Dec. 4
for warning Chen Shui-bian that his alleged money laundering via overseas banks
had come to the attention of the international anti-money laundering enterprise,
the Egmont Group.</P>
      <P>However,  one of Chen Shui-bian's attorneys said that the prosecutors were
investigating Lee on their own initiative rather than on a tip-off by Chen Shui-
bian.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile  Lin Chih-chia,  secretary-general  of the Taiwan Solidarity Union of
which Lee is the spiritual leader, said Chen Shui-bian is trying to distract
public attention from his own offenses and is using the allegations against Lee
as a red herring.</P>
      <P>Lin urged the prosecutors to clear Lee's reputation as soon as possible by
conducting a thorough investigation into the allegations.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's agricultural authorities plan to revitalize 60,000 hectares of fallow
farmland in 2009 to increase food production, a senior agriculture official
disclosed Friday.</P>
      <P>Yu Sheng-feng, deputy director-general of the Agriculture and Food Agency under
the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture, said the plan to revitalize the fallow
land has been submitted to the Cabinet for consideration.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan currently has 220,000 hectares of farmland lying idle, Yu
said his agency hopes to allow food crops to be grown on 60,000 hectares of that
land.</P>
      <P>The plan would allow subsidies of NT$50,000 per hectare each year for the owner
of the farmland -- higher than the NT$45,000 paid by the government to the
owners not to farm the land. Of the NT$50,000 subsidy, NT$40,000 will be paid by
the government, while the remaining NT$10,000 will come from the tenant farmers,
according to Yu.</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture has been working on a program to increase Taiwan's
rice farming by 20,000 hectares in order to raise the national rice reserves
from 300,000 metric tons in 2008 to 400,000 metric tons in 2009.</P>

      <P>The monitoring score for Taiwan's economic indicators in November dropped one
point from the previous month to 11 -- the lowest score in nearly seven years,
according to a report released by the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) Friday.</P>
      <P>A blue light continued to flash for the third consecutive month, indicating the
economy is mired in a recession.</P>
      <P>The CEPD uses five colors to measure domestic economic health, with "red"
indicating serious overheating, "yellow-red" for slight overheating, "green" for
steady growth, "yellow-blue" for a slowdown and "blue" for recession.</P>
      <P>The composite index of leading indicators -- a barometer for the economy's
outlook in the coming three months -- fell by 0.8 percent from the previous
month to 110.3.</P>
      <P>Hung Jui-bin, director-general of the CEPD's Economic Research Department,
attributed the worsening results to continuing slumps in external trade,
consumption and financial activities.</P>
      <P>With leading indicators in many industrial  countries also falling, and exports
slumping dramatically, domestic consumption slowing and unemployment rising,
Taiwan will have a hard time extracting itself from the recession in the near
future, Huang warned.</P>
      <P>The index of coincident indicators, which represents the current economic
situation, stood at 92.1 in November, down 5.8 percent from the previous month,

    <HEADLINE>China should dismantle missiles pointed at Taiwan: MAC committee</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.   26  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Consultative  Committee of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
said recently that China should, as soon as possible, dismantle its missiles
that are pointed at Taiwan and stop boycotting Taiwan's participation in
international organizations.</P>
      <P>The 169th consultative committee meeting of the MAC on Wednesday agreed that,
alongside the recent closer economic ties forged with China, the Taiwan
government should also find ways to fight for Taiwan's dignity and international
space.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should also urge China to take the initiative to show its willingness to
further improve the bilateral relations between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait, the committee suggested.</P>
      <P>The committee members said that China should understand very well feelings of
the Taiwanese people, and in the interest of further promoting positive
interaction between the two sides, should remove its missiles that are aimed at
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Reports have put the number of ballistic missiles deployed along China's east
coast and targeting Taiwan at more than 1,000.</P>
      <P>Turning to the recent launch of direct air and shipping links between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait, some members of the committee said that the links
should not be seen as a panacea for Taiwan's economic woes.</P>
      <P>In touting the recent economic cooperative efforts between the</P>
      <P>two sides, the Taiwan government should emphasize that they are part of the
process of normalizing bilateral cross-strait ties, the committee members
advised.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ruling party Kuomintang (KMT) and the main opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) should find ways to resolve their differences and reach
some agreement on cross-strait policy, as meaningless debates and accusations
between the two parties will neither win the public's support nor serve the best
interests of Taiwan, the majority of committee members said.</P>
      <P>The committee members urged the MAC not to be swayed by any particular party of
interest group, as its role is to serve as a platform for communication and
negotiations on cross-strait matters.</P>
      <P>However, the MAC also has a role to promote and strengthen interaction between
the ruling and opposition parties in order to be able to design proper and
unbiased policies in the future, the committee said.</P>
      <P>As for the just-concluded forum between the KMT and the Communist Party of China
(PCP), the committee members said that was held in a period of transition and
that the future necessity of a such a forum should be discussed among the ruling
and opposition parties and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).</P>
      <P>NGOs and academics could also be part of a non-official communication channel
between the two sides of the strait, the committee suggested.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A lawmaker of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) surrendered her party rights Friday,
pending clarification of her dual citizenship issue.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Ching-an informed the KMT in a written notice that effective
immediately, she has temporarily given up her party rights and will refrain from
taking part in any activities of the KMT legislative caucus until the dispute
over her dual citizenship issue is resolved.</P>
      <P>The KMT's head office later confirmed it had received the notice and had agreed
to her decision. It urged the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to contact the U.S.
government to clarify the issue as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In a separate notice to the legislature, Lee said that with immediate  effect,
she will not accept any salary  from the legislature.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng indicated earlier in the day that the
legislature will wait until Jan. 31 to see whether Lee can produce a document
certifying the loss of her U.S. citizenship, before considering the next move.</P>
      <P>Wang said the legislature was expecting U.S. authorities to clarify whether Lee
had lost her U.S. citizenship as early as 1994 when she was first elected to
public office in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The dual citizenship issue surfaced in March with reports that Lee, sworn in to
her fourth legislative term Feb. 1, had never formally renounced her U.S.
citizenship.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Nationality Act requires all public office holders with dual
nationality to renounce their foreign citizenship. Within one year of being
sworn in, they must submit a certificate certifying the loss of their foreign
citizenship, the act stipulates.</P>
      <P>Lee, who obtained U.S. citizenship in 1991, contended that she legally lost her
status as a U.S. citizen when she was first sworn in as a Taipei city councilor
in 1994. She cited U.S. law, which lists serving in a foreign government as one
of the legal conditions for losing U.S. nationality.</P>
      <P>Replying to Taiwan's inquiry on the citizenship status of sitting legislators,
the U.S. State Department said in a recent letter to the foreign ministry that
Lee "has previously been documented as a U.S. citizen with a U.S. passport and
that no subsequent loss of U.S. citizenship has been documented."</P>
      <P>The State Department, however, also said that U.S. citizens serving in a foreign
government "may have committed an expatriating act if they do so with the intent
to relinquish their U.S. nationality."</P>
      <P>"While the Department (of State) has not made any determination regarding loss
of nationality for the individual named above, it could do so based on evidence
that he or she committed a potentially expatriating  act  with  the intention
of relinquishing  U.S. nationality. Any such determination would be retroactive
to the date of the expatriating act," the letter reads.</P>
      <P>Although a State Department official said the U.S. government now considers the
case closed, the Taipei government still sees Lee's U.S. citizenship status as
not "ultimately determinative" and is requesting that the U.S. give a clear-cut

      <P>Taiwan's economic planning authorities announced Friday that it supports
allowing casinos as part of leisure resorts on the country's outlying islands,
including Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu.</P>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) made the announcement
at its year-end news conference, with CEPD Vice Chairman Huang Wan-hsiang
assessing that the new industry will create approximately 5,000 jobs, and
15,000-25,000 indirect employment opportunities.</P>
      <P>The long debate on whether or not to allow the development of the gambling
business in Taiwan concluded Friday, with the government agreeing that gambling
facilities will be allowed, but only if they are part of a comprehensive leisure
resort.</P>
      <P>According to a government survey conducted in July, 44 percent of the population
support the idea of lifting the ban on casinos while 36 percent oppose it.</P>
      <P>Among the proponents, 44 percent said gambling facilities should be established
only on the outlying islands, while 9 percent said they should also be allowed
on Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>Among the residents on the outlying islands who were polled, 47 percent
expressed support for the proposal, while 36 percent were opposed to it. Among
those in support of the idea, 45 percent said casinos should be allowed on the
outlying islands.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials concluded that the majority of residents on Taiwan proper and on
the outlying islands agree that the islets should be opened to the gambling
business.</P>
      <P>At the press conference, CEPD Chairman Chen Tain-jy said that as soon as
gambling is legalized in the country, the administration will allow casinos to
be established first on the outlying islands.</P>
      <P>An amendment to lift the ban on gambling businesses on the outlying islands is
in a long line of bills backed up in the legislature.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's agricultural authorities plan to revitalize 60,000 hectares of fallow
farmland in 2009 to increase food production, a senior agriculture official
disclosed Friday.</P>
      <P>Yu Sheng-feng, deputy director-general of the Agriculture and Food Agency under
the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture, said the plan to revitalize the fallow
land has been submitted to the Cabinet for consideration.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan currently has 220,000 hectares of farmland lying idle, Yu
said his agency hopes to allow food crops to be grown on 60,000 hectares of that
land.</P>
      <P>The plan would allow subsidies of NT$50,000 per hectare each year for the owner
of the farmland -- higher than the NT$45,000 paid by the government to the
owners not to farm the land. Of the NT$50,000 subsidy, NT$40,000 will be paid by
the government, while the remaining NT$10,000 will come from the tenant farmers,
according to Yu.</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture has been working on a program to increase Taiwan's
rice farming by 20,000 hectares in order to raise the national rice reserves
from 300,000 metric tons in 2008 to 400,000 metric tons in 2009.</P>

      <P>A fish farming group in the southern county of Tainan received two
certifications for the quality of its tilapia, Tainan Magistrate Su Huan-chih
announced Saturday.</P>
      <P>The group, consisting of 11 fish farmers with a combined aquaculture area of
50.06 hectares, received ISO 22000 certification for food safety management from
Australia and the Taiwan Good Agricultural Practice from Taiwan, Su said.</P>
      <P>Su said the group went through strict process and standards in controlling and
improving its tilapia farming in order to get the two certifications.</P>
      <P>Group leader Chen Lien-yi, who is also the president of the county's Nan Ying
Aquaculture Association, said the aquaculturists worked very hard to get the
certifications.</P>
      <P>Su said the group will need to make continuous efforts to make sure the
certifications are renewed every year, and he added that it is also working on
obtaining GlobalGAP, a certification necessary for exporting Taiwanese tilapia
to the European Union.</P>
      <P>He expressed hope that the two certifications will help increase the tilapia
selling price in both local and foreign markets, and said the county government
will help the aquaculturists with marketing to create a niche market for safe
and healthy Taiwanese tilapia that are a cut above cheaper tilapia sold by other
countries.</P>
      <P>The county has about 2,260 hectares given over to tilapia, with annual
production of 26,317 tons worth NT$791.6 million (US$23.9 million).</P>

      <P>Taiwan will cooperate with Michelin -- the French publisher of the acclaimed Le
Guide Michelin -- to publish a guidebook for Taiwan in both French and English,
a Government Information Office (GIO) official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Manfred Peng, director of the GIO's Department of International Information,
revealed that tourism, pop music and gourmet cuisine in Taiwan will be the major
themes in the government's publicity plan for 2009.</P>
      <P>Sealing a contract with Michelin to promote tourism in Taiwan will be the GIO's
first task in 2009, Peng went on, noting that it is the Michelin Guide's
international approach and professionalism that persuaded the office to
cooperate with the publisher.</P>
      <P>Addressing the GIO's publicity policy, Peng stated that unlike the previous
Democratic  Progressive  Party government,  which concentrated on publicizing
Taiwan's political situation and its bids for membership of international

      <P>The pair of giant pandas that arrived at the Taipei Zoo from China early this
week is expected to get used to their new environment in a couple of weeks,
despite a slight drop in their weights, an official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to Lin Hua-ching, head of the zoo's conservation center, Tuan Tuan --
the male panda -- is more active at night than Yuan Yuan, his female companion.</P>
      <P>Although they are eating more compared with when they just arrived, the animals'
weights have dropped by nearly four kilograms, he said.</P>
      <P>He attributed the weight loss to an increase in physical activity as a result of
their exploring the new environment and a decrease in appetite because of
nervousness  and anxiety toward their new surroundings. The situation should not
be a cause for concern as long as the weight loss remains within a normal range
and the pandas remain energetic, he added.</P>
      <P>In a bid to lessen the animals' anxiety, the zoo has included in their diet
fresh bamboo from their original habitat in China's Sichuan Province, Lin said.</P>
      <P>However, the zoo will not import any more of the bamboo from Sichuan because the
pandas are adapting well to Taiwanese bamboo, he went on.</P>
      <P>The pandas, which were delivered to the zoo Dec. 23, are a gift from China.</P>
      <P>The zoo has said it is working toward the goal of opening its new panda house to
the public in a month's time, as the animals are required to stay in quarantine
for a minimum of 30 days after their arrival.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has recently donated 200 metric tons of rice to Kiribati in a bid to help
relieve a food shortage in the Pacific nation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The rice, which was handed over to the Kiribati government on Christmas Eve, is
intended for distribution to hospitals, clinics and public boarding schools,
MOFA officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials quoted Republic of China Ambassador to Kiribati Chen Shih-liang as
saying that the rice arrived just in time for Christmas and demonstrates
Taiwan's care and friendship for the people of Kiribati.</P>
      <P>In the future, Taiwan agricultural missions will continue to promote farming,
stockraising and aquaculture in Kiribati to help resolve the country's food
shortage, the officials said.</P>
      <P>According to the MOFA, few crops are grown in Kiribati because the country is
comprised mainly of coral atolls, and the people there rely heavily on imported
rice.</P>
      <P>As a result, soaring global food prices earlier this year have seriously

      <P>The Baroque-style Taipei Guest House, a century-old national historical
landmark, will open to the public from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Jan. 1 to coincide with
various government-held New Year celebrations, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) announced Saturday.</P>
      <P>Visitors are required to present identification documents in order to be allowed
entry and advised to show up before 3: 30 p.m., when the latest admissions will
be allowed, according to the announcement.</P>
      <P>As part of efforts to protect the historical compound, the ministry warned that
photography will be prohibited and that certain areas will be off-limits to
visitors.</P>
      <P>Traffic controls in the surrounding area will be imposed, as the nearby
Presidential Office will also be opened to the public on that day, the ministry
added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in order to meet growing visitor demand, the MOFA also announced that
it will open the guest house once per month starting January -- double the 2008
opening times -- and estimated that the move will attract approximately 60,000
visitors throughout next year.</P>
      <P>Cultural and public welfare groups, as well as architecture departments of
universities will also be permitted to visit the compound after submitting
applications to the ministry, the MOFA went on.</P>
      <P>Members of the public will no longer be required to make reservations to visit,
the ministry said, adding that visitors will, however, need to provide
identification documents and submit to security checks.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Guest House, designed by Japanese architects and completed in 1901,
used to serve as the residence of the governor-general during the Japanese
occupation.</P>
      <P>Its name was changed to its current one in 1950 and it is now used to receive

      <P>The government should take notice of the risks involved  in cross-Taiwan  Strait
economic and financial cooperation and map out precautionary measures to deal
with adverse circumstances, economic scholars and former government officials
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Stock Exchange former Chairman Wu Rong-i, Financial Supervisory
Commission former Chairman Shih Chun-chi, Mega Holdings former General Manager
Tung Rei-bin, National Central University Professor Chiu Chun-jung and Chen Po-
chih, chairman of the Taiwan Thinktank -- a pro-independence non-government
think tank -- made the remarks at a symposium held in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The symposium,  titled "Honey or Knife?  The Effects  and Consequences  of
Cross-Taiwan  Strait  Economic  and  Financial Cooperation" was the first of
four sessions of the Taiwan Thinktank Forum.</P>
      <P>Chen said that as all policies have their pros and cons, one should  conduct
risk  assessment  and  take  precautions  or countermeasures to minimize the
harm such policies might cause. However, he claimed, the government has only
focused on the benefits of economic and financial cooperation with China while
neglecting the potential risks and possible consequences that might occur in the
long term.</P>
      <P>"If someone wants to eat honey on a knife, at least you have to let them know
that he might get hurt," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that 40 percent of Taiwan's total exports are China-bound and that
shipments to China suffered a dramatic 38 percent drop in November, Chen said
this has significantly impacted the country's economy. "It is like putting all
your eggs in one basket," he said.</P>
      <P>Noting that a financial memorandum of understanding  (MOU) covering the banking
and securities sectors might be inked during the next round of cross-strait
talks, Shih said Taiwanese banks will not stand on an equal footing with their
Chinese counterparts in terms of market opportunities because the scales of
Chinese banks are much bigger than Taiwanese ones.</P>
      <P>He cautioned that the signing of such an MOU will be in China's favor because
according to Chinese regulations, only about 10 Taiwanese banks will be able to
meet the thresholds for setting up branches and will not be allowed to accept
renminbi deposits for three years after their establishment, placing severe
restrictions on their profitability.</P>

      <P>The southern county of Tainan has performed well in terms of environmental
protection, as its resource recycling rate continues to increase while its
river-cleaning efforts have helped cut pollution, a local official said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chiang Shih-min, director-general of the county's Bureau of Environmental
Protection, said the county's recycling rate increased from 10.6 percent in 2004
to 11.22 percent in 2007, with this year's figure predicted to reach 30 percent.</P>
      <P>In 2007, the county's resource recycling created NT$26.8 million (US$81,126) of
revenue and saved NT$29.85 million in incineration expenses, creating a total
economic benefit of more than NT$56 million, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>According to another official of the same department, the county has reduced the
polluted reaches of the Erren River from 4.91 km to 3. 53 km by carrying out a
series of pollution control and prevention projects.</P>
      <P>Tainan Magistrate Su Huan-chih designated 2007 as the county's river-cleaning
year to focus on these efforts, the official noted.</P>
      <P>The projects included setting up a river patrol of 190 volunteers to gather
evidence on river pollutions and increasing the frequency of government
inspections on river polluters.</P>
      <P>The county has also established an electronic river pollution map and a

      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming voiced his support Friday for state-
run businesses expanding their overseas markets after the country's oil refiner
-- CPC Corp., Taiwan -- signed four cooperation agreements on oil exploration
with its Chinese counterpart earlier that day.</P>
      <P>Yiin said the government-run companies' moves to explore trade opportunities in
foreign countries,  including China, will win government support as long as they
hold the core technologies and invest according to regulations.</P>
      <P>In addition to CPC, Taiwan Sugar Corp. has also registered its trademark in
China in preparation for making inroads into that vast market with its
population of over 1.3 billion people.</P>
      <P>Earlier that day, CPC Chairman Wenent Pan and Fu Chengyu, general manager of the
Beijing-based China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC) signed agreements that
include a letter of intent for closer cooperation in oil exploration, market
expansion, technical exchanges and personnel training.</P>
      <P>The two enterprises also agreed to extend a contract on joint exploration in the
Tainan Basin in the Taiwan Strait and the Chaozhou-Shantou Basin off the coast
of southern China's Guangdong Province until Dec. 31, 2010, as well as agreeing
on a joint study of the Nanjihtao Basin near the midline of the strait and a
transfer of a 30 percent stake of CNOOC's onshore Block 9 in Kenya to CPC.</P>
      <P>The CPC-CNOOC cooperation in oil exploration began in 1998 with the start of a
joint venture  in the Tainan  Basin and the Chaozhou-Shantou Basin and continued
with the establishment of their first joint well in the strait in 2002.</P>
      <P>According to CPC, it also refined crude oil under contract from CNOOC -- China's
largest offshore oil and gas producer -- in the early 2000s.</P>
      <P>China has a greater demand for diesel than for other oil products, while Taiwan
has a bigger demand for gasoline, so that CNOOC's payment for CPC refining --
paid in the form of gasoline -- was a win-win situation, CPC said.</P>
      <P>The cooperation ended after international crude oil prices began surging and
domestic demand for CPC products increased, according to CPC.</P>
      <P>However, the company stressed that it will boost cooperation with CNOOC in the
future on business that is mutually beneficial.</P>

      <P>Huang made the remarks at the 2008 Taiwan Cultural and Creative Industry Summit,

in Taiwan, which the CCA is willing to provide assistance with," she added.</P>
      <P>In a recent discussion about the beauty of Taiwan with noted theater director
Stan Lai, movie director Hou Hsiao-hsien and Lin Hwai-min, founder of Cloud Gate

      <P>The official said the county started providing clean needles in June 2007 and
was the first local government to adopt the measure to stop addicts from sharing
needles, which is a common way for the AIDS virus to spread.</P>
      <P>According to Tainan Deputy Magistrate Yen Chun-tzuo, the county government
provided about 520,000 clean needles from last June to this May, 28 percent of

      <P>Taiwan's strength is being sapped not only by corrupt politicians but also by
their supporters, former President Lee Teng-hui said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the annual meeting of the Chiayi chapter of the Friends of Lee Teng-
hui Association in central Taiwan, Lee suggested that political power transfer,
which is normal in any democracy, has only brought one disaster after another to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Without mentioning the name of his successor, Chen Shui-bian, Lee said the
country's power transfer of 2000 only "provided someone with the opportunity to
take bribes and launder money."</P>
      <P>"It is a pity that  one man was able  to mess  up the administration's
governance so badly," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Chen, who was swept to power in the 2000 presidential election was indicted Dec.
12, seven months after his second four-year term ended, on charges of money
laundering and corruption.</P>
      <P>"What is even more pitiful is that some people continue to support the corrupt
politician in defiance of his approaching court trial, " Lee went on.</P>
      <P>"The  country  is seriously  afflicted  by this  pervasive corruption," he said.</P>
      <P>Lee himself is under investigation for alleged money laundering, thanks to a
tip-off provided by Chen to prosecutors.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the country only jumped out of the frying pan and into the
fire when another power shift took place in 2008, putting the Kuomintang  back
into power with Ma Ying-jeou as president.</P>
      <P>"Justice  and human rights  have regressed  under the new administration in the
last year," Lee claimed, citing as examples the way protesters were roughed up
by police during a visit to Taiwan in November by a Chinese envoy, and claiming
that students who staged a sit-in to press their demands for changes to rules
governing assemblies and marches were violently driven away by police.</P>
      <P>"And Ma's administration is at a total loss about what to do in the face of the
economic slowdown caused by international financial crisis," he continued.</P>
      <P>He predicted that the government's plan to hand out shopping vouchers to the
public in an attempt to boost consumption will bring only temporary relief, as
the root causes of the current crisis remain unaddressed.</P>
      <P>"Instead, the government should boost both public and private investment and
increase exports," Lee said.</P>

      <P>The chairwoman of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) revealed
Saturday that the party will convene a national affairs conference next year to
outline new guidelines and attempt to integrate the country's opposition
parties.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ing-wen made the announcement during talks with DPP members in the central
county of Taichung. She also said the party will continue movements in the
Legislative Yuan and on the streets to convey what she described as "the
people's" discontent with the ruling Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Tsai accused President Ma Ying-jeou of leaning toward China at the expense of
Taiwan's national sovereignty and claimed that people are worried that the Ma
government is retreating from defense and diplomatic frontlines to please
communist China.</P>
      <P>Talking about the country's economic problems, Tsai said the ruling party has
appeared reluctant to help local small- and medium-sized enterprises ride out
the recession caused by the global financial meltdown.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the ruling party's incompetence is the reason for the
worsening domestic recession.</P>
      <P>The DPP lost power to the KMT in the March 20 presidential election after
governing the country for eight years between 2000 and 2008.</P>
      <P>Its defeat was attributed to a series of corruption scandals involving top-

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has yet to make a final decision on the redrawing of the
nation's administrative borders, a spokesman for the Presidential Office said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Wang Yu-chi said the president heard a briefing by the Ministry of the Interior
Friday and that "the matter is still under assessment."</P>
      <P>He denied that the possible redrawing is to cater to a plan to merge Taichung
city and county into a single administrative district, which the Cabinet said
earlier could be completed by 2010.</P>
      <P>Wang was responding to reports by the United Daily News that in a bid to upgrade
Taiwan's international competitiveness, Ma had decided to redraw the nation's
administrative borders to include three metropolitan areas and 15 counties from
the present 23 cities and counties and two special municipalities after a
meeting with relevant government agencies Friday.</P>
      <P>The three metropolises will revolve around the cities of Taipei, Taichung and
Kaohsiung, according to the reports. Taipei will be a merger of Taipei City,
Taipei County and Keelung City, while Taichung city and county will be merged
and Kaohsiung City will be merged with Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>The 15 counties will be Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Miaoli, Changhua, Nantou, Yunlin,
Chiayi (a merger of the present city and county) , Tainan (a merger of the
present city and county) , Pingtung, Yilan, Hualien, Taitung, Penghu, Kinmen and
Lienchiang, the reports also said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei said the same day that if the goal of
three metropolises and 15 counties is implemented, his county will be willing to
work with the policy.</P>
      <P>But he also said the central government should coordinate with the local
governments to clearly define their respective rights and responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Tainan Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair, who has harbored the hope of merging his city with
Tainan County and having it upgraded to a municipality, expressed disappointment
Saturday about the possible redrawing.</P>
      <P>Attending a cerebration for the 110th anniversary of the founding of National
University of Tainan, Hsu said the city, a cultural capital, plays a major role
in Taiwan's history and that "if its status is downgraded, the government will
be a sinner in the nation's history."</P>
      <P>But Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who attended the same event, said
Hsu's remarks were over the top and that the conditions under which the city and

      <P>Tainan County in southern Taiwan is continuing to provide clean hypodermic
needles at street vending machines and convenience stores for drug addicts in an
effort to curb the spread of AIDS, a local health official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The official said the county started providing clean needles in June 2007 and
was the first local government to adopt the measure to stop addicts from sharing
needles, which is a common way for the AIDS virus to spread.</P>
      <P>According to Tainan Deputy Magistrate Yen Chun-tzuo, the county government
provided about 520,000 clean needles from last June to this May, 28 percent of
which were recycled after use.</P>
      <P>Tainan Magistrate Su Huan-chih said providing clean needles is only part of the
county's efforts to combat drug addiction and AIDS infection.</P>
      <P>The county also offers methadone replacement therapy at local health centers to
heroin addicts with the aim of reducing heroin addiction, Su said.</P>
      <P>Methadone is synthetic form of opiate given to heroin addicts to reduce
withdrawal symptoms when coming off heroin.</P>
      <P>The health official said the county started offering the therapy in 2006 and has
benefited more 220,000 people in the county, with three hospitals and five
therapy centers providing the drugs.</P>
      <P>The county's efforts have taken it to second place in terms of last year's
national drug prevention performance, the official added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's strength is being sapped not only by corrupt politicians but also by
their supporters, former President Lee Teng-hui said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the annual meeting of the Chiayi chapter of the Friends of Lee Teng-
hui Association in central Taiwan, Lee suggested that political power transfer,
which is normal in any democracy, has only brought one disaster after another to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Without mentioning the name of his successor, Chen Shui-bian, Lee said the
country's power transfer of 2000 only "provided someone with the opportunity to
take bribes and launder money."</P>
      <P>"It is a pity that  one man was able  to mess  up the administration's
governance so badly," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Chen, who was swept to power in the 2000 presidential election was indicted Dec.
12, seven months after his second four-year term ended, on charges of money
laundering and corruption.</P>
      <P>"What is even more pitiful is that some people continue to support the corrupt
politician in defiance of his approaching court trial, " Lee went on.</P>
      <P>"The  country  is seriously  afflicted  by this  pervasive corruption," he said.</P>
      <P>Lee himself is under investigation for alleged money laundering, thanks to a
tip-off provided by Chen to prosecutors.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the country only jumped out of the frying pan and into the
fire when another power shift took place in 2008, putting the Kuomintang  back
into power with Ma Ying-jeou as president.</P>
      <P>"Justice  and human rights  have regressed  under the new administration in the
last year," Lee claimed, citing as examples the way protesters were roughed up
by police during a visit to Taiwan in November by a Chinese envoy, and claiming
that students who staged a sit-in to press their demands for changes to rules
governing assemblies and marches were violently driven away by police.</P>
      <P>"And Ma's administration is at a total loss about what to do in the face of the
economic slowdown caused by international financial crisis," he continued.</P>
      <P>He predicted that the government's plan to hand out shopping vouchers to the
public in an attempt to boost consumption will bring only temporary relief, as
the root causes of the current crisis remain unaddressed.</P>
      <P>"Instead, the government should boost both public and private investment and
increase exports," Lee said.</P>

      <P>Three individuals or groups received the Peace Taiwan Awards Saturday for their
efforts to promote the concepts of fairness and justice and to narrow the gaps
observed in various areas in Taiwan or worldwide, according to the Taiwan
Grassroots Alliance for Peace (TGAP), which organized the awards.</P>
      <P>Speaking  at  the  award-presentation  ceremony,  alliance Director-General Chen
Chien-fu said the winning individual and groups serve as good examples of the
country's grassroots "peaceful force" to deal with conflict in fields such as
class, regions and human rights.</P>
      <P>Carol Chang,  president of the Macedonia-based Taiwan News International and
also author of many Balkan-related books published in Taiwan, garnered the award
in the individual category for her "long-term care for global underprivileged
refugees as well as the rights of war correspondents," according to the TGAP.</P>
      <P>Chang said she will continue to write reports on the issues if her work "will
make the world a better place."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taitung-based Austronesian Community College, a lifelong learning
institution on Taiwan's east coast, was credited in the group category for
launching various programs to revive the area's diverse aboriginal cultures and
transform the natives' traditional practices into tourist attractions, the TGAP
said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the youth award was given to the Lo Sheng Living Community for
their attempts to prevent the Lo Sheng Sanatorium -- the country's only
government-run leprosy institution -- from being dismantled to make way for
development and their efforts to protect what they described as the basic human
rights of the elderly patients who have lived in the sanatorium for almost their

      <P>The Taiwan High Court ordered the Taipei District Court Sunday to reconsider its
Dec. 18 decision to release former President Chen Shui-bian pending trial on
corruption and money laundering charges.</P>
      <P>The high court gave the order after the Supreme Prosecutors Office's Special
Investigation Division filed an appeal Thursday against the Taiwan District
Court's decision to release Chen.</P>
      <P>The court said the reasons behind the district court's decision to reject
prosecutors' request to detain Chen are flawed and inconsistent with the
public's experience and thereby should be replaced by an appropriate ruling made
by the district court itself.</P>
      <P>In the appeal presented to the Taiwan High Court, the prosecutors said they will
soon begin to investigate several other corruption cases allegedly involving
Chen and his wife, and that if he is allowed to remain free, some of the
witnesses, including three of his former close aides, might not dare to tell the
truth.</P>
      <P>It was the second time the Special Investigation Division had succeeded in
having the Taiwan High Court to threw out the Taipei District Court's decision
in the case. Chen and his wife Wu shu-chen were indicted for embezzling NT$104
million (us$3.12 million) from a special presidential office discretionary fund
during his presidency from 2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>They were also charged with accepting bribes worth NT$100 million and NT$200
million in connection with a land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million
in kickbacks to help a contractor win the tender for a government construction
project, according to the indictment.</P>
      <P>The district court rejected the Special Investigation Division's request to
detain Chen on Dec. 13, but that ruling was overthrown on Dec. 17 by the Taiwan
High Court which ordered the district court to reconsider the issue as requested
by the Special Investigation Division.</P>
      <P>However, the Taipei District Court upheld its decision in its second ruling on
Dec. 18 which led to the Special Investigation Division's second appeal on
Thursday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cross-strait postal remittance service to begin in mid-February</HEADLINE>

      <P>Two-way postal remittance services between Taiwan and China will begin in mid-
February after the Lunar New Year holiday, with Citibank New York serving as the
intermediary bank, Chunghwa Post Co. officials said Sunday.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for Chunghwa Post noted that one of four agreements signed Nov. 4 in
Taipei between Taiwan's semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation and its
Chinese counterpart -- the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
-- allows Taiwan and China to begin direct mail and postal remittance services.</P>
      <P>The direct cross-Taiwan Strait mail service began Dec. 15, and the direct postal
remittance service was originally scheduled to begin after the Lunar New Year
holiday.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, Chunghwa Post decided that because the estimated
volume of direct remittances in the initial stage will not be large, it will be
most cost-effective to use the services of Citibank.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  post offices have provided  services for outward remittances bound for
China through Citibank New York since 1991, but have not accepted inward
remittances from China.</P>
      <P>From around mid-February, the postal remittance service between the two sides
will work in both directions, with Citibank New York continuing to be the
intermediary.</P>
      <P>The spokesman continued that the Postal Savings Bank of China will join the Bank
of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China as a newcomer among the
Chinese banks at which remittances can be paid.</P>
      <P>All remittance transactions will be made in American dollars, with each transfer
limited to US$30,000. The service charge in Taiwan will be NT$500 for each wire
transfer and NT$400 for each mail transfer.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by Chunghwa Post show that between 1991 and 2007, the
average annual remittances from Taiwan to China amounted to NT$1.46 billion
(US$44.36 million).</P>

      <P>Four Deaflympics gold medal winners will be featured on a poster promoting the
21st Summer Deaflympics slated to be held in Taipei in 2009, a Taipei organizing
committee executive said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The four are tennis player Ho Chiu-mei, table tennis gold medalists Wen Chih-
hsuan and Yang Jung-tsung, and Tseng Shu-ning, a gold winner for swimming and
world record holder in the 50 meters freestyle at the 2005 event, according to
Yang Chao-kai.</P>
      <P>They were among the Taiwanese Deaflympics athletes who won nine gold, four
silver and three bronze medals at the 2005 Deaflympics in Melbourne, Australia,
Yang added.</P>
      <P>The committee invited the athletes to pose for the poster shoot in an attempt to
give the public a better understanding of the 2009 Deaflympics and drum up
interest for the event, Yang went on, adding that the posters will be
distributed around the country.</P>
      <P>The poster was the latest publicity effort following an earlier launch of an
advertisement featuring movie star Jackie Chan that was highlighted on outdoor
billboards at several Taipei MRT stations and at the Taipei Arena, and was put
online and aired on TV, Yang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taxi operators feeling economic pinch call for license controls</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/28/08  17:18:54</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"The economy is so bad, I quite often roam around looking for passengers but do
not get a single one for a whole morning, " laments Ho Chin-chuang, a taxi
driver of eight years who was queuing up in front of a hospital in Taipei
earlier in the month.</P>
      <P>Ho, in conjunction with a number of local taxi operators whose businesses have
been decimated by the economic downturn, recently issued a call for the
government to impose a quota on the number of taxis operating in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At present, the number of registered taxi drivers in Taiwan is estimated at more
than 90,000, of which more than 31,000 are operating in Taipei City with its
population of about 2.63 million people, which translates into a ratio of
residents to taxis of about 85:1, according to official statistics. The figures
also do not take into account the numerous unlicensed cabs.</P>
      <P>But with the low threshold for entry to the taxi industry, many people laid off
in the financial storm have turned to driving taxis, so that the true number is
likely to be larger than estimated.</P>
      <P>The taxi business has already gone down since the city's mass rapid transit
(MRT) system began operations 12 years ago, along with improvements to the
country's public transport networks.</P>
      <P>According to a Taipei City report, local taxi drivers in 2007 worked an average
of 10.4 hours per day, during which their cars were left empty for an average of
3.5 hours. They worked about 27-28 days per month, but only earned an average of
NT$1,754 (US$53) per day before deducting daily gasoline costs of about NT$617.</P>
      <P>The situation is even worse this year as the economic crisis has hit almost
everybody, leading to fewer people using cabs, said Chen Yuan-min,  secretary-
general  of the Taipei City Transportation Federation, which represents more
than 1,000 taxi companies and 20,000 taxi drivers in the city.</P>
      <P>Owing to the excessive number of taxis and a dramatic fall in passenger numbers,
about 70 percent of the taxis cruising Taipei City streets are empty, Chen said.</P>
      <P>"As a result, many cabbies have been forced to extend their working hours to 12
hours per day, earning a meager NT$2,000 per day before deducting other costs,
said Chen.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the government should map out measures to bring the number of
registered taxi licenses down from the present 90,000 to around 35,000 by 2013,
when the third stage of the Taipei MRT is completed, which he estimated could
help drive the rate of unoccupied taxis in the city down from 70 percent to 35
percent.</P>
      <P>He also expressed support for a proposal issued by taxi operators that the
government buy back operation licenses that are not being leased or used and
have those who are interested in becoming taxi drivers bid for the licenses.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's taxi business is made up of three major groupings: taxi companies,
which lease cars or operating certificates to drivers with vocation
certificates; taxi cooperatives, each of which comprises at least 20 individual
taxi drivers, with each paying NT$600-NT$800 in monthly dues; and individual
taxi drivers who operate with their own operating certificates.</P>
      <P>Acting on the suggestion of an advisory committee, the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications' (MOTC's) Directorate General of Highways has
suspended issuing new taxi license plates to taxi companies and taxi
cooperatives, while only granting licenses to so-called "excellent taxi drivers,
" referring to those who have been members of a taxi company or cooperative as a
taxi driver for six years with a good record, according to agency officials.</P>
      <P>The number of new licenses issued to those individual taxi drivers is around
1,000 per year, the officials added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang Mu-han, chief of the Transportation Corporation and Management
Division of the MOTC's Institute of Transportation, said that even if the
government were to agree to buy back taxi licenses, it would not solve the
industry's problems but would cause many employees in the sector to lose their
jobs, while also increasing the number of illegal cabbies.</P>
      <P>He added that creating demand for taxi services could be another option to help
the industry, citing as an example a new carpool pilot program being implemented
in Taipei City and around various high speed rail stations that is seen as a
good way to attract passengers.</P>
      <P>In contrast to the official concerns about the plight of taxi drivers, however,
customers are taking a much dimmer view of the issue. Wang Mei-yu, who takes a
cab only once in a while, questioned why despite the fact that taxis were
allowed to increase fares when oil prices were high, fares have not now been
adjusted back down to normal levels at a time when oil prices have plummeted to
a new low.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan gets world's highest full-score success rate in math exam</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 28 (CNA)
12/28/08  17:50:25
(By Jian Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan enjoyed the highest full-score rate in the world in the recent American
Mathematics Contest 8 (AMC8) , with 124 of the country's junior high school
students attaining full marks among the 9,100 registrants, the 99 Cultural and
Educational Foundation announced at a press conference Sunday.</P>
      <P>Although the United States generated the most full-mark students, Taiwan ranked
first in terms of the ratio of students within the top 5 percent,  according to
the foundation, which deals with AMC8 registrations in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Foundation CEO Yan Chi-Lin said, however, that in contrast to the U.S. -- where
all junior high students are required to take the exam -- in Taiwan it is an
elective test, which he said suggests that some degree of prior selection is
exercised.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he noted, the good local results should not be viewed as a general
reflection of the abilities of the country's students.</P>
      <P>Yan said an analysis of the test results show that Taiwanese students generally
perform more poorly on questions that involve longer descriptions or require
more complex thinking than others that can be worked out simply by calculating.</P>
      <P>As AMC centers on the development of logical thinking, the foundation's Chairman
Ho Yan-ming expressed hope that the exam can serve as inspiration for
improvement in Taiwan's math education, which places most of the emphasis on
calculation skills.</P>
      <P>Chang Fu-Kuo, president of the Tainan-based Ying-Hai High School in southern
Taiwan, which produced the most full-score students in the country, echoed Ho's
statement,  saying that "mathematical ability is not just all about solving
questions."</P>
      <P>He said his school has designed a course based on the AMC spirit, which trains
students in logical thinking in the process of dealing with math questions
instead of simply pursuing answers.</P>
      <P>In addition, the foundation noted that the number of Taiwan's full-mark
students, which made up 30 percent of the 412 students who received perfect
scores worldwide, also broke the country's own record, up from the 2006 figure
of 121.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, eight elementary students also achieved perfect scores in the upper-
level exam, which also broke the country's record, the foundation added.</P>
      <P>The AMC8 was held in November, with a worldwide participation of 155,000.</P>

      <P>A charity auction of artworks by 52 local artists will begin Monday and run
through Jan. 16 at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall's art gallery to help the
Taipei-based Chou Ta-kuan Cultural and Educational Foundation raise operating
funds, foundation staff members said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Among the 52 artists who have donated works for the auction are renowned
painters such as Au Ho-nien and Lee Chi-mao.</P>
      <P>Au is an outstanding third-generation painter of the Lingnan School, a master
who depicts all subjects and is known for his ability to combine poetry,
calligraphy and painting, while Lee is well-known for combining Western skills
with his Chinese painting techniques in watercolor and ink works.</P>
      <P>Other donating artists include Lee Hsiu-fang, Lien Sheng-yen, Chang Ko-chi, Hsu
Hai-chin, Pai Tsung-jen, Liu Ping-heng, Chou Cheng and Sun Chia-chin.</P>
      <P>The National Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Management Office launched the auction by
seeking help from the artists after its executives learned that the foundation
had exhausted its funds and was badly in need of new donations.</P>
      <P>The Chou Ta-kuan Foundation was down to just NT$565 (US$17) in October,
prompting its members to take to the streets to seek donations from the public
for its Melody of Hope Awards and Scholarships.</P>
      <P>The foundation was established in 1997 by the parents of Chou Ta-kuan -- a young
poet who died of cancer at the age of 10 -- to commemorate his deep love for
life and his unwavering spirit in fighting his cancer.</P>
      <P>It has sponsored various activities and programs, including presenting the Chou
Ta-kuan Love for Life Awards each year to select individuals from around the
world. The 2008 awards were presented in September to 26 people, including eight

    <HEADLINE>Formosan black bears spotted near mountain trail in Yushan park</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Formosan black bears, an ursine subspecies indigenous to Taiwan, have recently
been spotted on lower-altitude mountain trails in the Yushan National Park in
southern Taiwan, park rangers said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Formosan black bears, or Selenarctos thibetanus formosanus, used to be widely
distributed in forests throughout Taiwan, but the expansion of human settlement
and land development has gradually forced the animals to retreat deeper and
deeper into the mountains to avoid humans.</P>
      <P>In recent years, Yushan National Park Administration (YNPA) officials said only
people who often frequent forests at high elevations can have much chance of
spotting a bear.</P>
      <P>However, some rangers said they found black bear pawprints last month around a
mountain hut in the Yushan park at a medium elevation where mountain climbers
like to camp out. Early this month, park rangers also spotted fresh claw
scratches made by the animals on tree trunks along a mountain trail between
Dongpu and Guangao in Nantou County's Sinyi township.</P>
      <P>"Reports from rangers show that a trend is taking shape with Formosan black
bears venturing into mountainous regions frequented by humans," said a YNPA
official.</P>
      <P>As to why the bears are appearing in lower-altitude forests again, the official
said they could be attracted by the smell of food left by mountain climbers.</P>
      <P>In addition, the official went on, the number of other species such as barking
deer and goats along mountain trails has increased in recent years, which could
also have drawn the bears down from the heights.</P>
      <P>With the chances of encountering Formosan black bears increasing, the official
reminded mountain climbers to remain calm and composed if they happen to come
across any of the animals.</P>
      <P>"While Formosan black bears can be ferocious and dangerous, they will usually
not attack unless they are threatened, hurt or feel that their cubs are in
danger, " the official said, adding that the best thing to do in the event of an
encounter is to stay calm, try not to provoke the animal, and leave the vicinity
as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The official further said that Formosan black bears, although strong, sturdy and
skilled at mountain climbing, are less agile and slower than other carnivores.
He also advised mountain climbers to refrain from climbing trees or feigning
death should they come across a bear.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ties with China do not jeopardize Taiwan's sovereignty: president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 28 (CNA)
12/28/08  19:43:01

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday that the closer economic ties with China have
in no way jeopardized Taiwan's sovereignty or dignity and that the government's
recent launch of daily direct cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights, and direct
shipping and postal links with China, is beneficial to Taiwanese citizens and
will raise Taiwan's competitiveness in the region.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during a speech he gave at a workshop for senior officials
on programs related to China.</P>
      <P>"My administration has always aimed to serve the best interests of Taiwan," Ma
said, adding that four accords signed in November are all economic issues of
major concern to Taiwan and are absolutely irrelevant to the delicate
sovereignty issue.</P>
      <P>The results of recent opinion polls show that the majority of the public favor
the launch of the direct links with China, as more than two-thirds of the
respondents believe the agreements signed with China will have a very positive
effect on the economy, said Ma.</P>
      <P>Using the panda issue as an example, Ma said that despite the fact that the
Secretariat of the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species of
Wild and Fauna and Flora (CITES) said earlier this month that the transfer of
pandas from China to Taiwan was in the category of internal/domestic trade, the
delivery of the animals followed the mode of a country-to-country transfer and
has in no way belittled Taiwan's status, adding that if it was an
internal/domestic transfer, no customs declaration would have been needed.</P>
      <P>As giant pandas are an endangered species subject to the protection of the
CITES, cross-border transfers of the animals must follow strict CITES
guidelines. According to the guidelines, the two parties must supply export and
import permits confirming that all conditions for the transfer have been met.
This implies that the transaction is between two countries.</P>
      <P>"The logic behind it is simple, " said Ma. "No-one is required to present a
passport or customs declaration when traveling within the borders of a country."</P>
      <P>Turning to a just-concluded forum between the ruling Kuomintang (KMT)  and the
Communist  Party  of China,  Ma said Taiwan's quasi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) and its Chinese counterpart -- the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) -- cannot replace all the the functions of
Non-Government Organizations (NGOs).</P>
      <P>"We need all the help we can get, " said Ma adding that in the near future, the
SEF and the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) will not be able to
handle the daily increasing matters between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing that there are more than 60 channels of communication between the
United States and China, Ma noted that NGOs and academics are a vital part of
the non-official communication channels between the two sides of the strait that
can contribute significantly to the improvement of cross-strait ties and
cooperation.</P>
      <P>Ma also said the various government agencies should strengthen communications
among themselves in order to better serve the interests of the public in the
planning of future negotiations with China,  as the new era in cross-strait
ties  requires  the participation of the entire government system.</P>
      <P>"The pacts with China represent an opportunity to boost Taiwan's economy but
should not be regarded as a panacea for Taiwan's economic woes, " said Ma,
adding that the government should always hope for the best but prepare for the
worst.</P>
      <P>Urging both Taiwan and China to show their willingness to further improve
bilateral relations, Ma said Taiwan should find ways to increase positive
interaction with China, as the development of two-way ties is a vital priority.</P>
      <P>Since the KMT returned to power in May, Ma's administration has been working to
melt the ice between the two sides of the strait and to forge links with China,
particularly on the economic front.</P>
      <P>In their second round of talks held in Taipei from Nov. 3-7, SEF Chairman Chiang
Pin-kung,  and his Chinese counterpart,  ARATS President Chen Yunlin, signed
four agreements to allow daily direct cross-strait flights,  direct shipping
links and direct postal services, as well as the establishment of a food safety
mechanism between the two sides.</P>
      <P>According to the MAC, which charts the country's China policies and oversees the
SEF, the agenda for the next cross-strait dialogue will include cross-strait
cooperation in the areas of combating crime, strengthening food safety, the
inspection and quarantine of agriculture produce, and on investment, financial,
fishery, cultural and educational cooperation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday that the delivery of two giant pandas to
Taiwan from China was not an internal/domestic transfer as described by a United
Nations agency, as the animals went through customs and into quarantine when
they arrived in the country.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a workshop for government officials on Chinese affairs, Ma said that
since China issued an export permit for the pandas stating the importer  as
"Taiwan Taipei" and accepting "Chengdu" as the origin of export which was later
accepted by Taiwanese  customs,  it  clearly  followed  the  mode  of  a
country-to-country delivery.</P>
      <P>In addition, a correction letter was sent Saturday to the secretariat of the
U.N.-affiliated Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild
Fauna and Flora (CITES), which referred to the panda transfer as an
internal/domestic transfer, according to the Forestry Bureau under the Cabinet-
level Council of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials said the letter was designed to clarify Taiwan's standpoint on
the issue as total adherence to the strict CITES provisions regarding imports of
endangered animal and plant species, regardless of the fact that Taiwan is not a
CITES signatory.</P>
      <P>The officials further explained that the export permit issued by the Chinese
authorities followed the form of the certificates used in previous transfers of
Chinese endangered fauna and flora to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The procedures, the officials went on,  complied with the standards stipulated
by CITES between signatory and non-signatory countries.</P>
      <P>Critics have argued that the pandas, offered by China as a gift of goodwill and
friendship and now settling into their new quarters at the Taipei Zoo, are a
sign of China's belittlement of Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>The debate became even more heated when opposition Democratic Progressive  Party
(DPP)  legislators  pointed  out that CITES categorizes the transfer as
internal/domestic trade which therefore did not need to be reported to the
organization.</P>

      <P>A traffic route between Jiantan Station on the Taipei Mass Rapid Transit
system's Red Line and Chinese Culture University on Yangmingshan in suburban
Taipei has been selected for the implementation of a carpool trial for taxis
that will begin Dec. 31, a Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC)
official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The MOTC initiated the program in a bid to solve the problem of an oversupply of
taxis by cutting the ratio of taxis running without passengers, boosting
cabbies' incomes, decreasing the use of private vehicles and cutting carbon
emissions, according to the official.</P>
      <P>The route was picked from among eight possible routes because of the heavy
traffic volume on it, the official said, adding that a Taipei City-based taxi
fleet has been granted the right to operate the carpool service.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,500 passengers are expected to take taxis on the route per day,
which can be translated into an estimated NT$30 million in revenue per year for
taxi operators, according to Lin Huei-ling, deputy chief executive of the taxi
fleet.</P>
      <P>Under the preliminary plan, passengers would be charged a flat taxi fare between
the two destinations and can enter or leave the taxi at any point along the

    <TEXT>Re CEP0014, the headline should read: "MOTC to launch pioneer taxi-sharing
scheme Dec. 31." A corrected full version follows: MOTC to launch pioneer taxi-
sharing scheme Dec.31

Taipei, Dec. 28 (CNA) A traffic route between Jiantan Station on the Taipei Mass
Rapid Transit system's Red Line and Chinese Culture University on Yangmingshan
in suburban Taipei has been selected for the implementation of a carpool trial
for taxis that will begin Dec. 31, a Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) official said Sunday.

The MOTC initiated the program in a bid to solve the problem of an oversupply of
taxis by cutting the ratio of taxis running without passengers, boosting
cabbies' incomes, decreasing the use of private vehicles and cutting carbon
emissions, according to the official.

The route was picked from among eight possible routes because of the heavy
traffic volume on it, the official said, adding that a Taipei City-based taxi
fleet has been granted the right to operate the carpool service.

A total of 1,500 passengers are expected to take taxis on the route per day,
which can be translated into an estimated NT$30 million in revenue per year for
taxi operators, according to Lin Huei-ling, deputy chief executive of the taxi
fleet.

Under the preliminary plan, passengers would be charged a flat taxi fare between
the two destinations and can enter or leave the taxi at any point along the
route, the MOTC official said.

However, passengers will be charged different rates if different numbers of
passengers take the taxi together. The rate for the carpool will differ from the
ordinary one, which charges passengers by the number of kilometers traveled, the
official added.

For example, according to the existing taxi fare of between NT$250 to NT$260,
each passenger will be charged NT$125 for a one-way trip if two passengers share
a taxi, while each passenger will pay NT$85 if three share a taxi and NT$65 if
there are four passengers, the official explained.

The MOTC also plans to expand the carpool service to those traveling between
Jiantan Station and Chutzuhu, as well as other scenic spots on Yangmingshan,
with a flat fare of NT$115, to coincide with the Yangmingshan Flower Festival
between February and March and the calla lily season from May to June.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>MAC reaffirms equality in direct cross-strait shipping services</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan-owned but foreign-registered ships are entitled to operate direct
shipping services across the Taiwan Strait on an equal basis, Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lai was responding to media reports that the 20 Taiwan-owned, foreign-registered
vessels would all be barred from entering Chinese ports from the beginning of
next year, which critics said would eventually lead to China's monopoly of
cross-strait gravel shipping services and even its dominance of Taiwan's gravel
market.</P>
      <P>According to the bilateral agreement signed Nov.4 on the launch of direct
shipping links, Lai said, the two sides agree that all those ships can ply
direct cross-strait routes on an equal basis so long as they had been operating
gravel shipping business before the Dec.15 inauguration of direct shipping
links.</P>
      <P>"Equal participation is the guiding principle in dealing with issues regarding
direct cross-strait shipping services, " Lai said, adding that if there is any
problem or discrimination in relevant operations, the government will address it
through negotiations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  MAC Vice Chairman Fu Dong-cheng  said the two intermediary bodies --
Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and China's Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) -- clearly outlined the "equal participation"
principle for direct shipping service operations when they signed direct
shipping links accord.</P>
      <P>"The equal participation principle applies to all vessels that had been involved
in indirect cross-strait  shipping services, including gravel shipment, before
the opening of direct shipping links," Fu reiterated.</P>
      <P>On a reported incident in which a Taiwanese gravel ship was barred from entering
China's Huangpu port last week even though it had a certificate issued by
Taiwan's Taichung Harbor Bureau, Fu said he had gained a better understanding of
China's stance through a communication channel.</P>
      <P>According to Fu, China has offered two formulas for Taiwanese vessels to apply
for permissions to enter its ports. The first way is to file an online
application for each voyage and the other is to apply for a long-term permit.
Vessels that had operated indirect cross-strait shipping services in the past
can apply for long-term entry permits through their shipping agents.</P>
      <P>Quoting Chinese sources, Fu said, Chinese authorities have so far not yet
received any application from Taiwanese shipowners. Fu said the MAC has asked
the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) to look into the
situation.</P>
      <P>Fu further said some differences still exist between the two sides' shipping
regulations. Among others, China would not allow entry of commercial vessels
older than 33 years. As gravel shipping charges are usually very low, shipping
companies tend to use old vessels.</P>
      <P>"We'll ask the MOTC to study whether China's 'age' limit is reasonable, " Fu
said, adding that if necessary, the two sides will negotiate a solution through
two non-governmental intermediary bodies -- Taiwan's Taiwan Strait Shipping
Association and China's Association for Shipping Across the Taiwan Strait.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan High Court ordered the Taipei District Court Sunday to reconsider its
Dec. 18 decision to release former President Chen Shui-bian pending trial on
corruption and money laundering charges.</P>
      <P>The high court gave the order after the Supreme Prosecutors Office's Special
Investigation Division filed an appeal Thursday against the Taiwan District
Court's decision to release Chen.</P>
      <P>The court said the reasons behind the district court's decision to reject
prosecutors' request to detain Chen are flawed and inconsistent with the
public's experience and thereby should be replaced by an appropriate ruling made
by the district court itself.</P>
      <P>In the appeal presented to the Taiwan High Court, the prosecutors said they will
soon begin to investigate several other corruption cases allegedly involving
Chen and his wife, and that if he is allowed to remain free, some of the
witnesses, including three of his former close aides, might not dare to tell the
truth.</P>
      <P>It was the second time the Special Investigation Division had succeeded in
having the Taiwan High Court to threw out the Taipei District Court's decision
in the case. Chen and his wife Wu shu-chen were indicted for embezzling NT$104
million (us$3.12 million) from a special presidential office discretionary fund
during his presidency from 2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>They were also charged with accepting bribes worth NT$100 million and NT$200
million in connection with a land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million
in kickbacks to help a contractor win the tender for a government construction
project, according to the indictment.</P>
      <P>The district court rejected the Special Investigation Division's request to
detain Chen on Dec. 13, but that ruling was overthrown on Dec. 17 by the Taiwan
High Court which ordered the district court to reconsider the issue as requested
by the Special Investigation Division.</P>
      <P>However, the Taipei District Court upheld its decision in its second ruling on
Dec. 18 which led to the Special Investigation Division's second appeal on
Thursday.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two-way postal remittance services between Taiwan and China will begin in mid-
February after the Lunar New Year holiday, with Citibank New York serving as the
intermediary bank, Chunghwa Post Co. officials said Sunday.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for Chunghwa Post noted that one of four agreements signed Nov. 4 in
Taipei between Taiwan's semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation and its
Chinese counterpart -- the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
-- allows Taiwan and China to begin direct mail and postal remittance services.</P>
      <P>The direct cross-Taiwan Strait mail service began Dec. 15, and the direct postal
remittance service was originally scheduled to begin after the Lunar New Year
holiday.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, Chunghwa Post decided that because the estimated
volume of direct remittances in the initial stage will not be large, it will be
most cost-effective to use the services of Citibank.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  post offices have provided  services for outward remittances bound for
China through Citibank New York since 1991, but have not accepted inward
remittances from China.</P>
      <P>From around mid-February, the postal remittance service between the two sides
will work in both directions, with Citibank New York continuing to be the
intermediary.</P>
      <P>The spokesman continued that the Postal Savings Bank of China will join the Bank
of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China as a newcomer among the
Chinese banks at which remittances can be paid.</P>
      <P>All remittance transactions will be made in American dollars, with each transfer
limited to US$30,000. The service charge in Taiwan will be NT$500 for each wire
transfer and NT$400 for each mail transfer.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by Chunghwa Post show that between 1991 and 2007, the
average annual remittances from Taiwan to China amounted to NT$1.46 billion
(US$44.36 million).</P>

      <P>The four are tennis player Ho Chiu-mei, table tennis gold medalists Wen Chih-

world record holder in the 50 meters freestyle at the 2005 event, according to

      <P>They were among the Taiwanese Deaflympics athletes who won nine gold, four
silver and three bronze medals at the 2005 Deaflympics in Melbourne, Australia,
Yang added.</P>
      <P>The committee invited the athletes to pose for the poster shoot in an attempt to
give the public a better understanding of the 2009 Deaflympics and drum up

      <P>The poster was the latest publicity effort following an earlier launch of an
advertisement featuring movie star Jackie Chan that was highlighted on outdoor

    <HEADLINE>Taxi operators feeling economic pinch call for license controls</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/28/08  17:18:54</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"The economy is so bad, I quite often roam around looking for passengers but do
not get a single one for a whole morning, " laments Ho Chin-chuang, a taxi
driver of eight years who was queuing up in front of a hospital in Taipei
earlier in the month.</P>
      <P>Ho, in conjunction with a number of local taxi operators whose businesses have
been decimated by the economic downturn, recently issued a call for the
government to impose a quota on the number of taxis operating in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At present, the number of registered taxi drivers in Taiwan is estimated at more
than 90,000, of which more than 31,000 are operating in Taipei City with its
population of about 2.63 million people, which translates into a ratio of
residents to taxis of about 85:1, according to official statistics. The figures
also do not take into account the numerous unlicensed cabs.</P>
      <P>But with the low threshold for entry to the taxi industry, many people laid off
in the financial storm have turned to driving taxis, so that the true number is
likely to be larger than estimated.</P>
      <P>The taxi business has already gone down since the city's mass rapid transit
(MRT) system began operations 12 years ago, along with improvements to the
country's public transport networks.</P>
      <P>According to a Taipei City report, local taxi drivers in 2007 worked an average
of 10.4 hours per day, during which their cars were left empty for an average of
3.5 hours. They worked about 27-28 days per month, but only earned an average of
NT$1,754 (US$53) per day before deducting daily gasoline costs of about NT$617.</P>
      <P>The situation is even worse this year as the economic crisis has hit almost
everybody, leading to fewer people using cabs, said Chen Yuan-min,  secretary-
general  of the Taipei City Transportation Federation, which represents more
than 1,000 taxi companies and 20,000 taxi drivers in the city.</P>
      <P>Owing to the excessive number of taxis and a dramatic fall in passenger numbers,
about 70 percent of the taxis cruising Taipei City streets are empty, Chen said.</P>
      <P>"As a result, many cabbies have been forced to extend their working hours to 12
hours per day, earning a meager NT$2,000 per day before deducting other costs,
said Chen.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the government should map out measures to bring the number of
registered taxi licenses down from the present 90,000 to around 35,000 by 2013,
when the third stage of the Taipei MRT is completed, which he estimated could
help drive the rate of unoccupied taxis in the city down from 70 percent to 35
percent.</P>
      <P>He also expressed support for a proposal issued by taxi operators that the
government buy back operation licenses that are not being leased or used and
have those who are interested in becoming taxi drivers bid for the licenses.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's taxi business is made up of three major groupings: taxi companies,
which lease cars or operating certificates to drivers with vocation
certificates; taxi cooperatives, each of which comprises at least 20 individual
taxi drivers, with each paying NT$600-NT$800 in monthly dues; and individual
taxi drivers who operate with their own operating certificates.</P>
      <P>Acting on the suggestion of an advisory committee, the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications' (MOTC's) Directorate General of Highways has
suspended issuing new taxi license plates to taxi companies and taxi
cooperatives, while only granting licenses to so-called "excellent taxi drivers,
" referring to those who have been members of a taxi company or cooperative as a
taxi driver for six years with a good record, according to agency officials.</P>
      <P>The number of new licenses issued to those individual taxi drivers is around
1,000 per year, the officials added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang Mu-han, chief of the Transportation Corporation and Management
Division of the MOTC's Institute of Transportation, said that even if the
government were to agree to buy back taxi licenses, it would not solve the
industry's problems but would cause many employees in the sector to lose their
jobs, while also increasing the number of illegal cabbies.</P>
      <P>He added that creating demand for taxi services could be another option to help
the industry, citing as an example a new carpool pilot program being implemented
in Taipei City and around various high speed rail stations that is seen as a
good way to attract passengers.</P>
      <P>In contrast to the official concerns about the plight of taxi drivers, however,
customers are taking a much dimmer view of the issue. Wang Mei-yu, who takes a
cab only once in a while, questioned why despite the fact that taxis were
allowed to increase fares when oil prices were high, fares have not now been
adjusted back down to normal levels at a time when oil prices have plummeted to
a new low.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan gets world's highest full-score success rate in math exam</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 28 (CNA)
12/28/08  17:50:25
(By Jian Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan enjoyed the highest full-score rate in the world in the recent American
Mathematics Contest 8 (AMC8) , with 124 of the country's junior high school
students attaining full marks among the 9,100 registrants, the 99 Cultural and
Educational Foundation announced at a press conference Sunday.</P>
      <P>Although the United States generated the most full-mark students, Taiwan ranked
first in terms of the ratio of students within the top 5 percent,  according to
the foundation, which deals with AMC8 registrations in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Foundation CEO Yan Chi-Lin said, however, that in contrast to the U.S. -- where
all junior high students are required to take the exam -- in Taiwan it is an
elective test, which he said suggests that some degree of prior selection is
exercised.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he noted, the good local results should not be viewed as a general
reflection of the abilities of the country's students.</P>
      <P>Yan said an analysis of the test results show that Taiwanese students generally
perform more poorly on questions that involve longer descriptions or require
more complex thinking than others that can be worked out simply by calculating.</P>
      <P>As AMC centers on the development of logical thinking, the foundation's Chairman
Ho Yan-ming expressed hope that the exam can serve as inspiration for
improvement in Taiwan's math education, which places most of the emphasis on
calculation skills.</P>
      <P>Chang Fu-Kuo, president of the Tainan-based Ying-Hai High School in southern
Taiwan, which produced the most full-score students in the country, echoed Ho's
statement,  saying that "mathematical ability is not just all about solving
questions."</P>
      <P>He said his school has designed a course based on the AMC spirit, which trains
students in logical thinking in the process of dealing with math questions
instead of simply pursuing answers.</P>
      <P>In addition, the foundation noted that the number of Taiwan's full-mark
students, which made up 30 percent of the 412 students who received perfect
scores worldwide, also broke the country's own record, up from the 2006 figure
of 121.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, eight elementary students also achieved perfect scores in the upper-
level exam, which also broke the country's record, the foundation added.</P>
      <P>The AMC8 was held in November, with a worldwide participation of 155,000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Formosan black bears spotted near mountain trail in Yushan park</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 28 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Formosan black bears, an ursine subspecies indigenous to Taiwan, have recently
been spotted on lower-altitude mountain trails in the Yushan National Park in
southern Taiwan, park rangers said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Formosan black bears, or Selenarctos thibetanus formosanus, used to be widely
distributed in forests throughout Taiwan, but the expansion of human settlement
and land development has gradually forced the animals to retreat deeper and
deeper into the mountains to avoid humans.</P>
      <P>In recent years, Yushan National Park Administration (YNPA) officials said only
people who often frequent forests at high elevations can have much chance of
spotting a bear.</P>
      <P>However, some rangers said they found black bear pawprints last month around a
mountain hut in the Yushan park at a medium elevation where mountain climbers
like to camp out. Early this month, park rangers also spotted fresh claw
scratches made by the animals on tree trunks along a mountain trail between
Dongpu and Guangao in Nantou County's Sinyi township.</P>
      <P>"Reports from rangers show that a trend is taking shape with Formosan black
bears venturing into mountainous regions frequented by humans," said a YNPA
official.</P>
      <P>As to why the bears are appearing in lower-altitude forests again, the official
said they could be attracted by the smell of food left by mountain climbers.</P>
      <P>In addition, the official went on, the number of other species such as barking
deer and goats along mountain trails has increased in recent years, which could
also have drawn the bears down from the heights.</P>
      <P>With the chances of encountering Formosan black bears increasing, the official
reminded mountain climbers to remain calm and composed if they happen to come
across any of the animals.</P>
      <P>"While Formosan black bears can be ferocious and dangerous, they will usually
not attack unless they are threatened, hurt or feel that their cubs are in
danger, " the official said, adding that the best thing to do in the event of an
encounter is to stay calm, try not to provoke the animal, and leave the vicinity
as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The official further said that Formosan black bears, although strong, sturdy and
skilled at mountain climbing, are less agile and slower than other carnivores.
He also advised mountain climbers to refrain from climbing trees or feigning
death should they come across a bear.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ties with China do not jeopardize Taiwan's sovereignty: president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 28 (CNA)
12/28/08  19:43:01
(By Luis Yu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday that the closer economic ties with China have
in no way jeopardized Taiwan's sovereignty or dignity and that the government's
recent launch of daily direct cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights, and direct
shipping and postal links with China, is beneficial to Taiwanese citizens and
will raise Taiwan's competitiveness in the region.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during a speech he gave at a workshop for senior officials
on programs related to China.</P>
      <P>"My administration has always aimed to serve the best interests of Taiwan," Ma
said, adding that four accords signed in November are all economic issues of
major concern to Taiwan and are absolutely irrelevant to the delicate
sovereignty issue.</P>
      <P>The results of recent opinion polls show that the majority of the public favor
the launch of the direct links with China, as more than two-thirds of the
respondents believe the agreements signed with China will have a very positive
effect on the economy, said Ma.</P>
      <P>Using the panda issue as an example, Ma said that despite the fact that the
Secretariat of the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species of
Wild and Fauna and Flora (CITES) said earlier this month that the transfer of
pandas from China to Taiwan was in the category of internal/domestic trade, the
delivery of the animals followed the mode of a country-to-country transfer and
has in no way belittled Taiwan's status, adding that if it was an
internal/domestic transfer, no customs declaration would have been needed.</P>
      <P>As giant pandas are an endangered species subject to the protection of the
CITES, cross-border transfers of the animals must follow strict CITES
guidelines. According to the guidelines, the two parties must supply export and
import permits confirming that all conditions for the transfer have been met.
This implies that the transaction is between two countries.</P>
      <P>"The logic behind it is simple, " said Ma. "No-one is required to present a
passport or customs declaration when traveling within the borders of a country."</P>
      <P>Turning to a just-concluded forum between the ruling Kuomintang (KMT)  and the
Communist  Party  of China,  Ma said Taiwan's quasi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) and its Chinese counterpart -- the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) -- cannot replace all the the functions of
Non-Government Organizations (NGOs).</P>
      <P>"We need all the help we can get, " said Ma adding that in the near future, the
SEF and the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) will not be able to
handle the daily increasing matters between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing that there are more than 60 channels of communication between the
United States and China, Ma noted that NGOs and academics are a vital part of
the non-official communication channels between the two sides of the strait that
can contribute significantly to the improvement of cross-strait ties and
cooperation.</P>
      <P>Ma also said the various government agencies should strengthen communications
among themselves in order to better serve the interests of the public in the
planning of future negotiations with China,  as the new era in cross-strait
ties  requires  the participation of the entire government system.</P>
      <P>"The pacts with China represent an opportunity to boost Taiwan's economy but
should not be regarded as a panacea for Taiwan's economic woes, " said Ma,
adding that the government should always hope for the best but prepare for the
worst.</P>
      <P>Urging both Taiwan and China to show their willingness to further improve
bilateral relations, Ma said Taiwan should find ways to increase positive
interaction with China, as the development of two-way ties is a vital priority.</P>
      <P>Since the KMT returned to power in May, Ma's administration has been working to
melt the ice between the two sides of the strait and to forge links with China,
particularly on the economic front.</P>
      <P>In their second round of talks held in Taipei from Nov. 3-7, SEF Chairman Chiang
Pin-kung,  and his Chinese counterpart,  ARATS President Chen Yunlin, signed
four agreements to allow daily direct cross-strait flights,  direct shipping
links and direct postal services, as well as the establishment of a food safety
mechanism between the two sides.</P>
      <P>According to the MAC, which charts the country's China policies and oversees the
SEF, the agenda for the next cross-strait dialogue will include cross-strait
cooperation in the areas of combating crime, strengthening food safety, the
inspection and quarantine of agriculture produce, and on investment, financial,
fishery, cultural and educational cooperation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday that the delivery of two giant pandas to
Taiwan from China was not an internal/domestic transfer as described by a United
Nations agency, as the animals went through customs and into quarantine when
they arrived in the country.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a workshop for government officials on Chinese affairs, Ma said that
since China issued an export permit for the pandas stating the importer  as
"Taiwan Taipei" and accepting "Chengdu" as the origin of export which was later
accepted by Taiwanese  customs,  it  clearly  followed  the  mode  of  a
country-to-country delivery.</P>
      <P>In addition, a correction letter was sent Saturday to the secretariat of the
U.N.-affiliated Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild
Fauna and Flora (CITES), which referred to the panda transfer as an
internal/domestic transfer, according to the Forestry Bureau under the Cabinet-
level Council of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials said the letter was designed to clarify Taiwan's standpoint on
the issue as total adherence to the strict CITES provisions regarding imports of
endangered animal and plant species, regardless of the fact that Taiwan is not a
CITES signatory.</P>
      <P>The officials further explained that the export permit issued by the Chinese
authorities followed the form of the certificates used in previous transfers of
Chinese endangered fauna and flora to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The procedures, the officials went on,  complied with the standards stipulated
by CITES between signatory and non-signatory countries.</P>
      <P>Critics have argued that the pandas, offered by China as a gift of goodwill and
friendship and now settling into their new quarters at the Taipei Zoo, are a
sign of China's belittlement of Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>The debate became even more heated when opposition Democratic Progressive  Party
(DPP)  legislators  pointed  out that CITES categorizes the transfer as
internal/domestic trade which therefore did not need to be reported to the
organization.</P>

Taipei, Dec. 28 (CNA) A traffic route between Jiantan Station on the Taipei Mass
Rapid Transit system's Red Line and Chinese Culture University on Yangmingshan
in suburban Taipei has been selected for the implementation of a carpool trial
for taxis that will begin Dec. 31, a Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) official said Sunday.

The MOTC initiated the program in a bid to solve the problem of an oversupply of

The route was picked from among eight possible routes because of the heavy

    <HEADLINE>MAC reaffirms equality in direct cross-strait shipping services</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan-owned but foreign-registered ships are entitled to operate direct
shipping services across the Taiwan Strait on an equal basis, Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lai was responding to media reports that the 20 Taiwan-owned, foreign-registered
vessels would all be barred from entering Chinese ports from the beginning of
next year, which critics said would eventually lead to China's monopoly of
cross-strait gravel shipping services and even its dominance of Taiwan's gravel
market.</P>
      <P>According to the bilateral agreement signed Nov.4 on the launch of direct
shipping links, Lai said, the two sides agree that all those ships can ply
direct cross-strait routes on an equal basis so long as they had been operating
gravel shipping business before the Dec.15 inauguration of direct shipping
links.</P>
      <P>"Equal participation is the guiding principle in dealing with issues regarding
direct cross-strait shipping services, " Lai said, adding that if there is any
problem or discrimination in relevant operations, the government will address it
through negotiations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  MAC Vice Chairman Fu Dong-cheng  said the two intermediary bodies --
Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and China's Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) -- clearly outlined the "equal participation"
principle for direct shipping service operations when they signed direct
shipping links accord.</P>
      <P>"The equal participation principle applies to all vessels that had been involved
in indirect cross-strait  shipping services, including gravel shipment, before
the opening of direct shipping links," Fu reiterated.</P>
      <P>On a reported incident in which a Taiwanese gravel ship was barred from entering
China's Huangpu port last week even though it had a certificate issued by
Taiwan's Taichung Harbor Bureau, Fu said he had gained a better understanding of
China's stance through a communication channel.</P>
      <P>According to Fu, China has offered two formulas for Taiwanese vessels to apply
for permissions to enter its ports. The first way is to file an online
application for each voyage and the other is to apply for a long-term permit.
Vessels that had operated indirect cross-strait shipping services in the past
can apply for long-term entry permits through their shipping agents.</P>
      <P>Quoting Chinese sources, Fu said, Chinese authorities have so far not yet
received any application from Taiwanese shipowners. Fu said the MAC has asked
the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) to look into the
situation.</P>
      <P>Fu further said some differences still exist between the two sides' shipping
regulations. Among others, China would not allow entry of commercial vessels
older than 33 years. As gravel shipping charges are usually very low, shipping
companies tend to use old vessels.</P>
      <P>"We'll ask the MOTC to study whether China's 'age' limit is reasonable, " Fu
said, adding that if necessary, the two sides will negotiate a solution through
two non-governmental intermediary bodies -- Taiwan's Taiwan Strait Shipping
Association and China's Association for Shipping Across the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New job creation program to target white collars</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) is planning to launch a new job creation
program targeting unemployed white-collar workers as the unemployment situation
continues to worsen in the country, CLA officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>Under the program, which is expected to be implemented in the first half of next
year, government agencies would provide a total of 56,000 jobs that would allow
workers with professional backgrounds to bring their creativity to bear to help
promote government policies, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The latest data from the Directorate  General  of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics show that Taiwan's unemployment rate rose to 4.64 percent in
November, with more than 500,000 people out of work.</P>
      <P>CLA officials noted that unlike the situation in 2003 when the country's
unemployment rate at one point soared to 5.17 percent as a result of business
reconstruction and industrial exodus, which hit mainly blue-collar workers, the
current problem triggered by a global economic recession is causing many white
collars to lose their jobs as well.</P>
      <P>However, the job creation programs introduced so far by the government have been
aimed mainly at blue collars.</P>
      <P>They include the "get to work" program launched in October, in which businesses
participating in the program will get a government subsidy of NT$10,000 per
month for each unemployed worker who had been out of work three or more
consecutive months prior to being hired, for a maximum period of six months.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) under increasing pressure because of
large-scale layoffs and a rising unemployment rate, Labor Minister Wang Ju-hsuan
reported Monday in the Legislative Yuan that the CLA has come up with a new plan
to help stabilizing the employment market and upgrade the professional skills of
workers.</P>
      <P>The "plan to enhance employment skills in the short-term," is also aimed at
discouraging enterprises from laying off workers.</P>
      <P>Under the program, enterprises that provide on-the-job training courses for
their employees will be eligible to apply for subsidies of NT$950,000 to NT$1.9
million over a period of six months, depending on the size of the business.</P>
      <P>Workers who participate in the program will also entitled to a monthly subsidy
of up to NT$10,000 (US$303) over a maximum period of six months.</P>
      <P>The subsidy will be provided to the businesses on condition that they maintain
their workforce size, do not lay off any of the employees attending the training
courses, and pay their staff at least the minimum wage of NT$17,280 per month.</P>
      <P>The CLA estimates that around 5,600 enterprises will apply to join the program,
which means that the total number of subsidized workers will be 168,000. This
will require a budget of around NT$15.97 billion, according to the CLA.</P>
      <P>"We expect that the government's plans to expand domestic demand will help boost
the job market next year," said Wang when asked by legislators if unemployment
will surge again once the subsidy period expires.</P>
      <P>The government has launched an NT$500 billion plan over four years to expand
domestic  demand  and enhance  infrastructure development, which is expected to
boost the employment rate and the gross domestic product.</P>
      <P>In a coordinated effort, the Cabinet-level CLA launched a program in October to
subsidize for up to six months enterprises and governmental units that hire
people who have been unemployed for a long time.</P>
      <P>To date, 13,518 people have been hired under the program, the CLA said.</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of the Economic Affairs,  1,600 enterprises shut down
in November and the number could rise to more than 10,000 by the end of the
year.</P>
      <P>According to the most recent report by the Directorate-General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics, the unemployment rate in Taiwan had climbed to 4.64
percent in November, representing a jobless population of 507,000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President calls for private investment in 12 infrastructure projects</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 29 (CNA)
12/29/08  14:57:42
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou urged domestic and foreign private enterprises Monday to
invest in the 12 "i-Taiwan" infrastructure projects, saying that Taiwan's
investment environment has improved as a result of better relations between
Taipei and Beijing and Taiwan's recent accession to the World Trade
Organization's (WTO's) Government Procurement Agreement (GPA).</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks at the "Experience-sharing and Business Alliance for
Promotion of Private Participation in Infrastructure Projects," which was
attended by Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, Public Construction Commission (PCC)
Minister Fan Liang-shiow and 400 representatives from local and foreign
businesses.</P>
      <P>The i-Taiwan 12 Projects include an aviation city development project centering
around Taoyuan International Airport in northern Taiwan and several other
infrastructure and urban renewal programs.</P>
      <P>Noting that during his presidential campaign in November 2007 he proposed the
i-Taiwan 12 Projects to improve Taiwan's investment environment, Ma said the
approach is even more important now considering the impact of the global
financial storm.</P>
      <P>"In an era of recession, we must expand domestic demand and public
construction," the president said, adding that the thawing relations between
Taiwan and China and Taiwan's accession to the WTO's GPA are the keys to the
success of such efforts.</P>
      <P>Noting that according to the U.S.-based Business Environment Risk Intelligence,
Taiwan's investment environment was rated the 5th best among the 50 countries
evaluated, Ma attributed the ranking to the government's efforts to improve
relations with China, which he said, has resulted in a significant reduction of
investment risks and uncertainties.</P>
      <P>Also with Taiwan's accession to the GPA earlier this month, Ma said, more
foreign companies will be willing to work with local enterprises on major
construction projects, which will be to the benefit of the government and the
society.</P>
      <P>Liu said Private participation in Infrastructure -- also known as Public Private
Partnership (PPP) -- has become a global trend as governments worldwide seek to
meet society's demands for high-quality and comprehensive public works. Monday's
business alliance session was like the "kick off" in a ball game because there
will be many more projects in the future for private investors, he added.</P>
      <P>Fan said the global financial crisis and its impact on the overall economic
environment have heightened the urgency of efforts to stimulate the economy,
expand domestic demand, and strengthen economic fundamentals.</P>
      <P>The government is therefore moving forward with the i-Taiwan 12 Projects, which
aims to generate NT$3.99 trillion (US$121 billion) in new investment over an
eight-year period, including NT$2.65 trillion via government procurement and
NT$1.34 trillion via PPP, he added.</P>
      <P>According to Fan, the PCC aims to attract NT$632.7 billion in PPP and it
expected that 124 contracts with a total investment amount of NT$212.2 billion
will be signed in 2009. These contracts are mainly for the construction of
transportation facilities and major facilities for tourist sites, major
industrial and commercial facilities and cultural and educational facilities, as
well as city renewal and sewage infrastructure, he added.</P>
      <P>At Monday's event, contracts worth NT$13.9 billion were signed for projects that
included the Taipei Mass Rapid Transportation Sangchung Station Joint Project,
Miaoli Chunan Toufen Sewage System BOT Project, and Taichung Harbor Petro-
chemical District Air Separation Plant Investment Project. The signing was
witnessed by Ma, Liu and Fan.</P>

      <P>An exhibition featuring fine agricultural products and specialties produced in
four cities and counties in central Taiwan was held at Taichung Park Sunday as a
pre-sale promotion before the products are marketed in Hong Kong and Macau.</P>
      <P>Representatives of Taichung city and county, Chunghua County and Nantou County
are set to depart Jan. 7, 2009 for Hong Kong and Macau to promote central Taiwan
tourism. The promotion efforts will include a fair in Macau from Jan. 9 to Jan.
12 featuring central Taiwan farm produce.</P>
      <P>The four local governments launched the pre-sale campaign in Taichung, with
Taichung Mayor Jason Hu, Taichung Magistrate Huang Chung-sheng, Nantou Deputy
Magistrate Chen Chih-ching and Changhua Deputy Magistrate Chang Juei-bin
personally promoting the local specialities.</P>
      <P>A one-dollar bidding competition and a series of performances were also staged
at the event to lure consumers.</P>
      <P>Mayor Hu said that the marketing strategy to make inroads into overseas markets
is a concerted effort by the four cities and counties aimed at combining the
strength of their experience to develop a common central Taiwan theme, rather
than each highlighting their own special characteristics.</P>
      <P>Hu said that in April 2007, he and Stanley C. Yen, president of the Landis Group
of Hotels and Resorts Group, made a trip to Hong Kong to tap into business
opportunities there, a promotion effort that he said attracted around 20,000
tourists from the China's special administrative region to Taichung City.</P>
      <P>With the opening of direct transport links across the Taiwan Strait, the number
of visitors to Taiwan from Hong Kong and Macau has been on the rise, which
suggests that the two regions have great market potential for the development of
Taiwan business and tourism, Hu added.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the four cities and counties plan to jointly visit the two regions in
the hope of attracting business there, Hu said.</P>
      <P>The three other local government chiefs also said that through the strategic
alliance among the central cities and counties, they will advertise central
Taiwan's features, specialties and beauty, not only in Hong Kong and Macau, but
also around the world.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) announced Monday that it will begin to
issue of Republic of China "ePassports" from Tuesday, making Taiwan the 60th
country in the world to use electronic passports.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Francisco H. L. Ou said at a press conference that the new
passports comply with the standards of the International Civil Aviation
Organization.</P>
      <P>The introduction of ePassports in Taiwan has been in the works for several
years, Ou said, adding that details of the new passport's features can be found
on the Web site www.epassport.com.tw.</P>
      <P>The passport application procedure and requirements will remain the same, and
the current machine readable passports could still be used until their expiry
date, according to Rita P. Chen, section chief of MOFA's Bureau of Consular
Affairs.</P>
      <P>The passport application fee will remain at NT$1,200 (US$36) until the end of
next year, but after that it will be increased by NT$400 to reflect the higher
production cost of the ePassport, she added.</P>
      <P>According to the foreign ministry, the ePassport contains a contactless chip and
antenna embedded in its back cover, with the bearer's biographical data and
facial image stored on the chip.</P>
      <P>The cover of the passport carries a symbol, along with the word "Taiwan" printed
in gold letters. The document has 52 pages with designs featuring Taiwan's
tourist attractions. On the data page are background images of the high speed
rail, airplanes, semiconductor wafers and wind turbines.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP urges CLA to lower laborers' relief loan interest</HEADLINE>

12/29/08  17:24:52
(By Emmanuelle Tzeng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party legislators proposed Monday that the
interest rate on relief loans to laborers be brought down to no more than 1.92
percent to help mitigate the burden on laborers in the face of the economic
slump.</P>
      <P>The legislators noted that the relief loans are aimed at helping workers ride
out the difficult times that are seeing them suffer unpaid leave and cutbacks in
personnel. However, the interest rate on these loans is 2.935 percent -- higher
than the interest rate for house purchase loans for civil servants, which is
only 1.92 percent.</P>
      <P>They proposed at a committee meeting in the Legislative Yuan that the interest
rate on laborers relief loans must not exceed 1.92 percent, or that the
government should give them an allowance.</P>
      <P>The proposal was approved by the committee.</P>
      <P>"For workers in financial difficulty, the relief loan is like providing charcoal
during snowy weather, while civil servants' home purchase loans are a perk of
the job, " said Lai Ching-te, a DPP legislator, describing the interest rate on
workers' relief loans as "unfair and unreasonable."</P>
      <P>In response, Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Minister Wang Ju-hsuan said the
council will review the regulations and cut interest rates within a month.</P>
      <P>The CLA announced earlier this month that it will raise the total budget for
laborers' relief loans from NT$10 billion (US$303 million) to NT$20 billion.</P>
      <P>According to the regulations, every worker in economic difficulty who has
participated in the labor insurance system for at least 15 years without overdue
bills can apply for a loan of NT$100,000 at an interest rate of 2.935 percent.</P>
      <P>To alleviate the pressure on workers from the high unemployment rate and
cutbacks in personnel, the CLA launched a series of projects this year to
attempt to stabilize the employment market.</P>
      <P>But the unemployment rate is still increasing, reaching 4.64 percent in
November, or 507,000 jobless people, according to the latest figures compiled by
the Directorate-General  of Budget, Accounting and Statistics.</P>

      <P>Workers at state-run companies will receive no more than the equivalent of one
month's salary as annual performance pay starting 2009, on a trial basis,
Minister of Economic Affairs (MOEA) Yiin Chii-ming said Monday.</P>
      <P>This means that annual performance bonuses for state-run company employees will
be adjusted downward beginning next year, with the revised calculation formula
to be based on the type of company and its performance, Yiin confirmed in
response to questions from reporters before a meeting of a tax reform committee
under the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>However, while the annual performance pay will be limited to one month's wages,
such employees will still be entitled to a work bonus of two months' salary, he

    <HEADLINE>One in four Taiwanese are from Hakka ethnic group: government survey</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 29 (CNA)
12/29/08  18:49:44

    <TEXT>
      <P>How many Hakkas are there in Taiwan? The answer may be in a recent government
survey which concluded the Hakkas accounts for 25.6 percent of Taiwan's entire
population, meaning one in four people in the country is from the Hakka ethnic
group.</P>
      <P>The 2008 poll was launched by the Cabinet-level Council for Hakka Affairs (CHA),
a government body which deals with matters concerning the Hakkas -- the second
largest ethnic group in Taiwan, following the Hoklo, early immigrants from
southern China's Fujian province.</P>
      <P>Unlike the Hoklos, ancestors of Taiwan's Hakkas immigrated mostly from China's
Guangdong province.</P>
      <P>The Hakkas are a sub-group of the Han Chinese people who fled famine and wars in
central China in past centuries and eventually settled in southern and eastern
China, predominantly in the provinces of Guangdong, Jiangxi and Fujian.</P>
      <P>The survey -- the most comprehensive -- found that 13.5 percent of the
respondents identified themselves directly or clearly as Hakka people, while 5.1
percent held a multiple identity with one of them being Hakka, and 7 percent
said they are related to Hakkas in blood ties.</P>
      <P>The survey concluded that Taiwan's Hakka population -- in a wide definition --
reached nearly 5.79 million people in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>CHA Minister Huang Yu-cheng has dubbed the survey on the Hakka population and
its basic data as the newest and most authoritative references for research on
the Hakka people and their life in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Previous government statistics on the Hakka population found that they made up
some 22 percent of the total population.</P>
      <P>According to the 2008 survey,  Taiwan's Hakkas were found concentrated in the
counties of Hsinchu, Miaoli and Taoyuan in northern Taiwan and Pingtung in
southern Taiwan.</P>

      <P>A total of 122 pieces of the work of noted U.S. pop art painter Andy Warhol from
Switzerland, Rome, and Spain were unboxed Monday in Taipei for the first-ever
Warhol exhibition in Taiwan that the organizers said will showcase the fabulous
life of this avant-garde artist starting Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is the first stop in Asia for thePop Art Godfather -- Andy Warhol World
Exhibition, " which is being organized here by the National Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall Management Office, China Times Media Group, and Art Magazine, with
the assistance of Taipei City Government.</P>
      <P>The exhibition will be open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. from Jan. 1 to March 29 at the
first display room of the National Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, closing only
on Jan. 25 and 26 for Chinese New Year.</P>
      <P>At a news conference, Monday, four of Warhols most well-known series -- Marilyn
Monroe that he created in 1967, Chairman Mao in 1972, Cow in 1971 and Flower in
1984 -- were unwrapped and introduced to Taiwanese art lovers.</P>
      <P>Refusing to disclose the total value of the paintings, curator Tsu Fen-lan
simply said that these paintings are under insurance totaling 30 million Euros,
among which,Joseph Beuys,a screenprint of noted German artist Joseph Beuys, is
the most expensive one, with an insurance amount of up to 470,000 Euros.</P>
      <P>China Times Principal Lin Sheng-fen said at the news conference that this
exhibition not only can boost Taiwans soft power of cultural and creative
industry,  but also can provide a good opportunity for Taiwans art industry to
learn how to turn art into business.</P>
      <P>Warhols philosophy ofart is business and business is art broke the boundaries
between the two and made him one of the most successful  artists in the 20th
century, said Chen Kuo-tsi, chairwoman of Contemporary Art Foundation.</P>
      <P>Describing Warhol as thegodfatherof comic art, Arts Magazine Publisher Ho Chen-
kuan said Warhols works are reflections of life, as he used everyday subjects to
create art.</P>
      <P>Warhol became a successful commercial illustrator during the 1960s by making
paintings of iconic American products such as Coca-Cola bottles and Campbells
Soup Cans.</P>
      <P>He switched to silk-screen prints which he produced serially, seeking not only
to make art of mass-produced items. but to mass produce the art itself, using
the same techniques to reproduce paintings with bright colors in different
versions and variations.</P>

      <P>The economic recession currently looming over the country is likely to bottom
out in mid 2009, Central Bank of the Republic of China Governor Perng Fai-nan
predicted Monday.</P>
      <P>Perng told the Legislative Yuan's Finance Committee that Taiwan's economy is
unlikely to be unaffected by the global economic downturn and that Taiwan must
try to stimulate domestic demand in order to minimize the negative external
impact on the country.</P>
      <P>According to Perng, cutting key interest rates is one of many methods to expand
domestic demand, and it is more important to introduce an expansionary fiscal
policy.</P>
      <P>Asked if Taiwan will move toward a zero rate policy, Perng said no, noting that
no country in the world has so far cut interest rates to zero.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Taiwan's key interest rates are higher than Japan's, though
lower than those of many other countries, including the United States.</P>
      <P>On capital flows, Perng said remittances by Taiwanese amounted to a net inflow
of US$5.6 billion in September, US$10.5 billion in October and US$2.1 billion in
November, while those by foreigners amounted to a net outflow of US$4.2 billion
in September, US$6.8 billion in October and US$1.2 billion in November.</P>
      <P>He said the central bank will pay attention to the purpose of remittances to
monitor a possible inflow of hot money, adding that the bank will allow the
market mechanism to decide the value of the New Taiwan dollar.</P>

      <P>Central Taiwan's Nantou County -- famous for its scenic Sun Moon Lake -- will
begin a series of cultural exchanges with Hangzhou in China's Zhejiang Province
-- a city also famous for its West Lake -- Nantou County Magistrate Lee Chao-
ching disclosed Monday.</P>
      <P>Lee said  Nantou  County  government  officials  and their counterparts from
Hangzhou will hold a forum in March 2009 at Sun Moon Lake to discuss matters
relating to setting up a sisterhood relationship between the two lakes.</P>
      <P>Lee expressed the belief that Nantou and Hangzhou will have more frequent
exchanges in the fields of culture, tourism and trade in the near future.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the two sides are also working on a plan to hold a Taiwan-
Zhejiang cultural festival, with a theatrical troupe from Zhejiang visiting
Taiwan to present a large-scale  stage performance, "The Legend of Dharma Master
Hung Yi", on Jan. 5 at the Nantou County Cultural Center as a warm-up event.</P>
      <P>The performance is sponsored by the Chung Tai Chan Monastery in Nantou County's
Puli township. Admission to the show is free.</P>
      <P>Master Hung Yi (1880-1942) was one of the greatest Buddhist monks in China
during the 20th century. He was born near the end of the Qing Dynasty into the
large and wealthy family of a salt merchant. He went to Japan in 1905 and
studied modern art.</P>
      <P>Originally named Li Shu-tung, Hung Yi was well-versed in music, painting,
poetry, calligraphy and drama and was a vanguard in modern China's new cultural
movement at the time. He had a colorful life before becoming a monk at a temple
in Hangzhou in 1918 at the age of 39.</P>
      <P>As a monk, Master Hung Yi studied Buddhist sutras diligently and devoted the
final 10 years of his life to preaching the Dharma. He died at age 63.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) announced Monday that it will open an
emergency service center at the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport on Jan. 1,
as part of its efforts to provide timely assistance to Taiwans citizens
traveling overseas.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference, Lo Yu-chung, director-general of the MOFAs
Bureau of Consular Affairs (BOCA), said the center will serve as the ministrys
one-stop window to contact relevant foreign authorities in case Taiwanese
citizens encounter emergencies abroad.</P>
      <P>The centers 0800-085-095 hotline is toll-free for calls made within the country,
Lo said, adding that the service, launched especially in time for the upcoming
New Year and Chinese New Year holidays, will be available all year round.</P>
      <P>Those who call the center from overseas should dial the local code for
international calls and then the number - 886-800-085-095 - for a fee, Lo said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government (DOH) highlighted Monday a program to donate medical instruments
and equipment to foreign countries, saying it is an effective medical diplomacy
tool and demonstrates Taiwan's desire to give back to the global community.</P>
      <P>The medical aid program not only shows Taiwan's concern (for the world) but also
helps increase Taiwan's visibility on the international stage, said Ministry of
Foreign Affairs official Lin Cheng-hui at a press conference, referring to the
Global Medical Instruments Support and Service Program (GMISS).</P>
      <P>The GMISS is a foreign aid program supported by the Cabinet-level Department of
Health (DOH) with the cooperation of National Taiwan University Hospital's
Department of Biomedical Engineering that collects medical instruments and
donates them to countries lacking medical resources.</P>
      <P>The donated items include mammographic instruments, colonoscopes, kidney
dialysis machines, anesthesia machines and ambulances.</P>
      <P>An online database system exists to register locally donated medical
instruments  and foreign  requests.  The Web site is http://gmiss.doh.gov.tw.</P>
      <P>According to the DOH, domestic hospitals, academic institutions and private
enterprises have donated thousands of medical instruments since the GMISS
program was launched in 2005.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the platform and assistance from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
groups that provide medical assistance abroad, 24 countries, including in
Central and South America, Africa and the Asia-Pacific region, have benefited
from the GMISS program, according to the DOH.</P>
      <P>Some, such as Vietnam, the Philippines and China, are not diplomatic allies of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The DOH expects the GMISS program  to link up with more international
nongovernmental organizations to raise the efficiency and effectiveness of
foreign medical aid.</P>
      <P>Aside from the instruments themselves, the program also provides post-donation
services to understand if the receiver countries need supplies of medical
disposables or technical consultation  and support.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government to cancel ID application quota for Chinese spouses: MAC</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) announced Monday that the government will
cancel the current quota of 500 per month for applications by Chinese spouses
for Taiwanese ID cards.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior is drafting amendments to the existing quota
regulations, and once the new regulations take effect, the amount of time needed
for Chinese immigrant spouses to qualify for a Taiwanese ID card will be
shortened significantly, the MAC said in a statement.</P>
      <P>Under amended regulations, the statement said, Chinese spouses will also no
longer have to wait eight years to become eligible to apply for an ID in Taiwan,
compared to the four years for foreign spouses from other countries.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, those who have gained eligibility to obtain an ID card will not
have to wait eight to nine months before they receive them, as the ID
application quota of 6,000 per year for Chinese spouses will be lifted.</P>
      <P>Under the draft amendment Chinese spouses will also no longer have to wait 13
years before they can apply for Taiwan entry for their children, although there
will be a quota of just 60 persons per year.</P>
      <P>According to the present regulations, Chinese spouses have to be in Taiwan for
at least eight years before they can register their household here and another
five years after that before they can apply to get their children into Taiwan.
The draft amendment cancels the second five-year waiting period.</P>
      <P>Previous administrations have argued that the strict rules were imposed to curb
marriages of convenience and to keep Chinese women out of Taiwan, despite the
fact that Taiwanese men tend to marry Chinese women more than women from other
countries.</P>
      <P>During the previous Democratic Progressive Party administration, harsh
regulations governing Chinese spouses were put in place, including a requirement
that they provide documented proof of financial solvency when applying for a
Taiwanese ID.</P>
      <P>The Chinese spouses and non-government organizations representing them have long
blasted such policies as discriminatory, unreasonable and not in line with human
rights, as marriages of convenience also exist among spouses from other
countries, while the divorce rate of locals with Chinese spouses is about the
same as that of local Taiwanese couples.</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of the Interior, 399,000 foreign spouses were
registered in Taiwan as of the end of 2007 -- 262,000 from China and 137,000
from other countries.</P>

      <P>Lawmakers of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) screening competing drafts of the Human Trafficking
Prevention Act agreed Monday that the legislation should impose harsh penalties
for human trafficking.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers, who are all members of the legislature's Internal Administration
Committee, began to screen several different versions of the bill in an attempt
to produce one unified version.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Wu Yu-sheng said that human trafficking has become a global
problem, and that in recent years, criminals have smuggled foreign nationals
into Taiwan using various pretexts.</P>
      <P>"The criminal acts not only violate human rights, they disrupt Taiwan's labor
market and disturb local social order. It is necessary that we enact legislation
to prevent the crime from getting worse," he said.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lai Ching-te, a whip of the DPP legislative caucus who introduced a
draft bill of the act, also called for harsh penalties to fight human
trafficking.</P>
      <P>The draft bill would stipulate a sentence of seven years in prison, plus a fine
of NT$7 million (US$212,410), for smuggling foreign women into Taiwan to work as
prostitutes, and a 10-year sentence, plus a fine of NT$10 million, if such
smuggled women are under 18 years of age.</P>
      <P>National Immigration  Agency Director-General  Hsieh Li-Kung welcomed the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy is likely to rebound in the middle of next year thanks to a
series of measures being adopted by the government to stimulate the economy,
President Ma Ying-jeou said in an exclusive interview with Web site Yahoo! Kimo
that will be posted in its news section Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Though he acknowledged that there is no "panacea" that will quickly turn around
the country's contracting economy, Ma said he believes the impact of the
government's stimulus measures will begin to be felt in the second quarter next
year.</P>
      <P>At a time when many workers have been laid off, the government should make
preparations and get ready for the next round of economic recovery, he said.</P>
      <P>Apart from more than 50,000 jobs opened by a temporary work creation project
launched by the Council of Labor Affairs in November, the government will also
put in place a separate employment program  next year that hopes to create
another 220,000  job opportunities.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, the government will invest NT$85 billion (US$2.58 billion)
in a consumption voucher program and another NT$270 billion on 12 national
infrastructure projects to get the economy going.</P>
      <P>The voucher program is a short-term policy designed to fuel economic activity in
the retail and restaurant sector in view of a sharp slump in private-sector
consumption, he explained.</P>
      <P>Ma admitted, however, that this kind of measure cannot be implemented every day,
and he said creating jobs and expanding infrastructure along with stepping up
private sector consumption were all crucial to reinvigorating Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Thanks to Taiwan's strategic location in East Asia and because of the
government's economic stimulus measures, the country's economy will definitely
take off at a rapid pace after the current economic recession comes to an end,
the president predicted.</P>
      <P>In terms of economic ties with China, Ma noted that the Dec. 15 establishment of
daily charter flights and the opening of shipping and postal links between
Taiwan and China has yet to positively impact Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>He said, however, that the new links will at least help shipping and aviation
companies reduce travel times and costs across the Taiwan Strait, and suggested
now was a good time for Taiwan's people to consider how the operating model for
the new one-day life circle across the Taiwan Strait will evolve.</P>
      <P>Ma is the third head of state interviewed by Yahoo after U. S. President George
W. Bush and South Korean President Lee Myung-bak.</P>
      <P>The questions directed to Ma in the interview were selected by a vote by more
than 10,000 Yahoo! Kimo users from over 100 inquires collected by its polling
center.</P>
      <P>The questions focused on economic issues of major public concern, including the
government's voucher program, consumer product price hikes and countermeasures
to tackle the current economic downturn.</P>
      <P>The interview will also be published by Yahoo! in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong,
Australia and the United States from January next year.</P>

      <P>The Dec. 12 indictment of former President Chen Shui-bian on corruption charges
has been selected by Taiwan's news agency as the top news event in the country
for 2008.</P>
      <P>The Central News Agency annually selects the year's top domestic news events.
For this year, the selection was based on events occurring up to Dec.12.</P>
      <P>A colorful and controversial figure in Taiwan politics, Chen faces charges that
he and his wife siphoned off special presidential funds for their personal use
during his presidency from 2000 to May of this year and pocketed tens of
millions of New Taiwan dollars in bribes.</P>
      <P>Chen was Taiwan's first former president to face criminal prosecution.
Prosecutors said they will ask the court to give him the harshest  punishment
because his crimes are major.  Chen,  a lawyer-turned-politician, has denied the
charges, dismissing his prosecution as a political persecution.</P>
      <P>Second on the top 10 list is the return to power of the Kuomintang (KMT)
following its landslide wins in both the Jan.12 legislative elections and the
March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The presidential poll marked the second time Taiwan's electorate had put the
opposition party in power in the country's history.</P>
      <P>Other news events that made the top 10 list are as follows in order of
importance:</P>
      <P>-- Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)  and China's Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) resumed dialogue in mid-June after a
nine-year hiatus.</P>
      <P>During their two rounds of talks in the past few months, SEF Chairman Chiang
Pin-kung and ARATS President Chen Yunlin signed six agreements to pave the way
for direct cross-strait transport and postal links.</P>
      <P>In November, Chen headed a high-profile delegation to visit Taipei, making him
the most senior People's Republic of China official ever to visit Taiwan. The
second Chiang-Chen meeting in Taipei was politically significant, with both
sides not denying each other and agreeing to expand exchanges.</P>
      <P>-- Former President Chen, in addition to facing charges of embezzling public
funds, made a public apology after admitting in August that his wife had wired a
portion of surplus campaign contributions abroad. The Special Investigation
Division under the Supreme Prosecutors  Office launched probes into alleged
money laundering  by Chen and his family  members  and during  the
investigation, many former government officials, including Chiou I-jen and Yeh
Sheng-mao, were taken into custody.</P>
      <P>-- Since the May 20 inauguration of the KMT administration, Taiwan's stock index
plunged from more than 9,200 points to far below the 10-year average of 6,560
and even continued its downward spiral toward a low of 4,000 points before
rebounding to hover around 4,300 points.</P>
      <P>-- Imports of toxic chemical melamine-tained milk powder and food ingredients
from China prompted the Department of Health to order removal of all products
containing those ingredients from local store shelves. Taiwan and China later
forged an emergency reporting mechanism for food safety concerns and Chinese
authorities offered an apology through its intermediary body over the incident
and promised to help local victims seek compensation.</P>
      <P>-- Ma Ying-jeou and Vincent Siew were sworn in as the Republic of China's new
president and vice president May 20. Ma called for speedy resumption of cross-
strait talks based on the so-called "1992 consensus" and pursued a "diplomatic
truce" to create a favorable climate for peaceful development of cross-Taiwan
Strait relations.</P>
      <P>-- The National Pension Act and the revised Labor Insurance Act cleared the
legislative floor, paving the way for implementation of the national pension
system in October 2008 and the new labor pension system Jan. 1, 2009.</P>
      <P>-- The exposure in May of a diplomatic scandal in which US$29.8 million in
diplomatic funds for establishing formal ties with Paupa New Guinea were
siphoned off by middlemen Ching Chi Ju and Wu Shih-Tsai led to the resignation
of then-Vice Premier Chiou I-jen and then-Foreign Minister James Huang. The key
suspect, Jin, remained abroad and judicial authorities are still probing the
case.</P>
      <P>-- KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung headed a delegation to visit China in late May,
during which he met with Communist Party of China General Secretary Hu Jintao,
who doubles as Chinese president. It marked the first time that the heads of the
ruling parties on both sides of the Taiwan Strait had met since the People's
Republic of China was established in 1949.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung District Court on Monday sentenced a former public prosecutor to
eight years and six months in prison on charges of corruption, forced sexual
intercourse, forced obscene acts and obstruction of personal freedom.</P>
      <P>Wu Chieh-jen, a prosecutor of the Kaohsiung Public Prosecutors Office, was found
guilty of committing the offenses against more than 10 women who were targets of
his investigations between 1999 and 2006.</P>
      <P>The court also decided to strip Wu of his citizen's rights for five years after
he finishes serving his prison term.</P>
      <P>The court ordered that before being put in jail, Wu should be subjected to
mandatory treatment for his deviant sexual urges.</P>
      <P>According to the prosecution, Wu used his influence as a prosecutor to coerce
the women to have sex with him and succeeded in compelling one of the women to
have sexual intercourse with him twice in June 2006.</P>
      <P>Chung Chung-hsiao,  a senior  prosecutor  of the Kaohsiung Prosecutors Office,
said that Wu had been suspended from office since he was first detained in
September 2006, and that in addition to the criminal proceedings, he was also
sent to the Control Yuan for possible impeachment, a case that has yet to be

    <HEADLINE>President's lack of days off draws attention</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The minister of the Central Personnel Administration (CPA) advised President Ma
Ying-jeou on Monday to take a vacation, with Presidential Office records showing
he has yet to take a day off since taking power in May.</P>
      <P>Chen Ching-hsiou suggested the president take time off on a regular basis to
maintain his physical strength, citing the practice of the U.S. president, who
regularly spends weekends at Camp David.</P>
      <P>Chen said the CPA is working on regulations that would grant Taiwan's president,
vice president and premier at least seven days off a year, as no existing law on
public servants sets vacation time for senior officials.</P>
      <P>The issue sparked a predicably partisan debate at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) urged the president to
push himself to pay attention to his health.</P>
      <P>"We really hope our president will be in a good shape, " said KMT lawmaker Chang
Sho-wen. "If his (Ma's) health is in trouble, it means our country has trouble."</P>
      <P>Legislator Lai Ching-te of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party countered
that the plan to encourage the president to take a break as standard "ass-
kissing."</P>
      <P>"It is hard to imagine that government officials would be concerned about
whether or not Ma takes time off at a time when most people are worried about
losing their jobs and are having trouble staying afloat," Lai argued.</P>
      <P>A Presidential Office official countered that the issue was not about whether
the president can legally take time off, as existing regulations do not
explicitly prevent him from doing so, but whether Ma would even be willing to
take a break.</P>
      <P>The president is the one who is not willing to take leave even for one day, the
official said, adding: "It would be meaningless to let him have seven days off."</P>

    <HEADLINE>One in four Taiwanese are from Hakka ethnic group: government survey</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 29 (CNA)
12/29/08  18:49:44

    <TEXT>
      <P>How many Hakkas are there in Taiwan? The answer may be in a recent government
survey which concluded the Hakkas accounts for 25.6 percent of Taiwan's entire
population, meaning one in four people in the country is from the Hakka ethnic
group.</P>
      <P>The 2008 poll was launched by the Cabinet-level Council for Hakka Affairs (CHA),
a government body which deals with matters concerning the Hakkas -- the second
largest ethnic group in Taiwan, following the Hoklo, early immigrants from
southern China's Fujian province.</P>
      <P>Unlike the Hoklos, ancestors of Taiwan's Hakkas immigrated mostly from China's
Guangdong province.</P>
      <P>The Hakkas are a sub-group of the Han Chinese people who fled famine and wars in
central China in past centuries and eventually settled in southern and eastern
China, predominantly in the provinces of Guangdong, Jiangxi and Fujian.</P>
      <P>The survey -- the most comprehensive -- found that 13.5 percent of the
respondents identified themselves directly or clearly as Hakka people, while 5.1
percent held a multiple identity with one of them being Hakka, and 7 percent
said they are related to Hakkas in blood ties.</P>
      <P>The survey concluded that Taiwan's Hakka population -- in a wide definition --
reached nearly 5.79 million people in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>CHA Minister Huang Yu-cheng has dubbed the survey on the Hakka population and
its basic data as the newest and most authoritative references for research on
the Hakka people and their life in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Previous government statistics on the Hakka population found that they made up
some 22 percent of the total population.</P>
      <P>According to the 2008 survey,  Taiwan's Hakkas were found concentrated in the
counties of Hsinchu, Miaoli and Taoyuan in northern Taiwan and Pingtung in
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The highest concentrations of Hakka people were located in Hsinchu County's
Hengshan and Beipu townships and Miaoli County's Tongluo township, with the
Hakka population in these places each reaching nearly 95 percent of the total
population, the survey showed.</P>
      <P>The percentage of Hakkas in Gongguan and Touwu townships of Miaoli County, as
well as the Emei township of Hsinchu County meanwhile reached 90 percent of the
townships' population.</P>
      <P>In eastern Taiwan's Hualien county, and northern Taiwan's Hsinchu City, 20
percent of the population are from the Hakka ethnic group, according to the
survey.</P>
      <P>In the areas that are not historically Hakka gathering spots, including some
Taipei City districts, as well as Yonghe, Banciao and Tucheng of Taipei County,
Fongyuan of Taichung County, Beitun of Taichung City, and Fengshan of Kaohsiung
City, the number of Hakka people was recorded surpassing 30,000 persons in each
location.</P>
      <P>Those places are where future policies on Hakkas should cover, said Huang.</P>
      <P>He noted that the survey will be very helpful to the council in its efforts to
promote the Hakkas' dialect and to preserve their unique culture.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by a private survey company contracted by the CHA in
368 townships and cities, as well as the outlying Kinmen, Penghu and Lienchiang
counties through telephone interviews on randomly selected adult citizens.</P>
      <P>A total of 51,803 valid samples were collected for the largest survey on the
ethnic group in recent years. The margin of error reached 0.5 percentage points.</P>

      <P>A total of 122 pieces of the work of noted U.S. pop art painter Andy Warhol from
Switzerland, Rome, and Spain were unboxed Monday in Taipei for the first-ever
Warhol exhibition in Taiwan that the organizers said will showcase the fabulous
life of this avant-garde artist starting Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is the first stop in Asia for thePop Art Godfather -- Andy Warhol World
Exhibition, " which is being organized here by the National Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall Management Office, China Times Media Group, and Art Magazine, with
the assistance of Taipei City Government.</P>
      <P>The exhibition will be open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. from Jan. 1 to March 29 at the
first display room of the National Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, closing only
on Jan. 25 and 26 for Chinese New Year.</P>
      <P>At a news conference, Monday, four of Warhols most well-known series -- Marilyn
Monroe that he created in 1967, Chairman Mao in 1972, Cow in 1971 and Flower in
1984 -- were unwrapped and introduced to Taiwanese art lovers.</P>
      <P>Refusing to disclose the total value of the paintings, curator Tsu Fen-lan
simply said that these paintings are under insurance totaling 30 million Euros,
among which,Joseph Beuys,a screenprint of noted German artist Joseph Beuys, is
the most expensive one, with an insurance amount of up to 470,000 Euros.</P>
      <P>China Times Principal Lin Sheng-fen said at the news conference that this
exhibition not only can boost Taiwans soft power of cultural and creative
industry,  but also can provide a good opportunity for Taiwans art industry to
learn how to turn art into business.</P>
      <P>Warhols philosophy ofart is business and business is art broke the boundaries
between the two and made him one of the most successful  artists in the 20th
century, said Chen Kuo-tsi, chairwoman of Contemporary Art Foundation.</P>
      <P>Describing Warhol as thegodfatherof comic art, Arts Magazine Publisher Ho Chen-
kuan said Warhols works are reflections of life, as he used everyday subjects to
create art.</P>
      <P>Warhol became a successful commercial illustrator during the 1960s by making
paintings of iconic American products such as Coca-Cola bottles and Campbells
Soup Cans.</P>
      <P>He switched to silk-screen prints which he produced serially, seeking not only
to make art of mass-produced items. but to mass produce the art itself, using
the same techniques to reproduce paintings with bright colors in different
versions and variations.</P>

      <P>The economic recession currently looming over the country is likely to bottom
out in mid 2009, Central Bank of the Republic of China Governor Perng Fai-nan
predicted Monday.</P>
      <P>Perng told the Legislative Yuan's Finance Committee that Taiwan's economy is
unlikely to be unaffected by the global economic downturn and that Taiwan must
try to stimulate domestic demand in order to minimize the negative external
impact on the country.</P>
      <P>According to Perng, cutting key interest rates is one of many methods to expand
domestic demand, and it is more important to introduce an expansionary fiscal
policy.</P>
      <P>Asked if Taiwan will move toward a zero rate policy, Perng said no, noting that
no country in the world has so far cut interest rates to zero.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Taiwan's key interest rates are higher than Japan's, though
lower than those of many other countries, including the United States.</P>
      <P>On capital flows, Perng said remittances by Taiwanese amounted to a net inflow
of US$5.6 billion in September, US$10.5 billion in October and US$2.1 billion in
November, while those by foreigners amounted to a net outflow of US$4.2 billion
in September, US$6.8 billion in October and US$1.2 billion in November.</P>
      <P>He said the central bank will pay attention to the purpose of remittances to
monitor a possible inflow of hot money, adding that the bank will allow the
market mechanism to decide the value of the New Taiwan dollar.</P>

      <P>Central Taiwan's Nantou County -- famous for its scenic Sun Moon Lake -- will
begin a series of cultural exchanges with Hangzhou in China's Zhejiang Province
-- a city also famous for its West Lake -- Nantou County Magistrate Lee Chao-
ching disclosed Monday.</P>
      <P>Lee said  Nantou  County  government  officials  and their counterparts from
Hangzhou will hold a forum in March 2009 at Sun Moon Lake to discuss matters
relating to setting up a sisterhood relationship between the two lakes.</P>
      <P>Lee expressed the belief that Nantou and Hangzhou will have more frequent
exchanges in the fields of culture, tourism and trade in the near future.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the two sides are also working on a plan to hold a Taiwan-
Zhejiang cultural festival, with a theatrical troupe from Zhejiang visiting
Taiwan to present a large-scale  stage performance, "The Legend of Dharma Master
Hung Yi", on Jan. 5 at the Nantou County Cultural Center as a warm-up event.</P>
      <P>The performance is sponsored by the Chung Tai Chan Monastery in Nantou County's
Puli township. Admission to the show is free.</P>

during the 20th century. He was born near the end of the Qing Dynasty into the
large and wealthy family of a salt merchant. He went to Japan in 1905 and
studied modern art.</P>
      <P>Originally named Li Shu-tung, Hung Yi was well-versed in music, painting,
poetry, calligraphy and drama and was a vanguard in modern China's new cultural
movement at the time. He had a colorful life before becoming a monk at a temple
in Hangzhou in 1918 at the age of 39.</P>

final 10 years of his life to preaching the Dharma. He died at age 63.</P>

      <P>The government (DOH) highlighted Monday a program to donate medical instruments
and equipment to foreign countries, saying it is an effective medical diplomacy
tool and demonstrates Taiwan's desire to give back to the global community.</P>
      <P>The medical aid program not only shows Taiwan's concern (for the world) but also
helps increase Taiwan's visibility on the international stage, said Ministry of
Foreign Affairs official Lin Cheng-hui at a press conference, referring to the
Global Medical Instruments Support and Service Program (GMISS).</P>
      <P>The GMISS is a foreign aid program supported by the Cabinet-level Department of
Health (DOH) with the cooperation of National Taiwan University Hospital's
Department of Biomedical Engineering that collects medical instruments and
donates them to countries lacking medical resources.</P>
      <P>The donated items include mammographic instruments, colonoscopes, kidney
dialysis machines, anesthesia machines and ambulances.</P>
      <P>An online database system exists to register locally donated medical
instruments  and foreign  requests.  The Web site is http://gmiss.doh.gov.tw.</P>
      <P>According to the DOH, domestic hospitals, academic institutions and private
enterprises have donated thousands of medical instruments since the GMISS
program was launched in 2005.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the platform and assistance from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
groups that provide medical assistance abroad, 24 countries, including in
Central and South America, Africa and the Asia-Pacific region, have benefited
from the GMISS program, according to the DOH.</P>
      <P>Some, such as Vietnam, the Philippines and China, are not diplomatic allies of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The DOH expects the GMISS program  to link up with more international
nongovernmental organizations to raise the efficiency and effectiveness of
foreign medical aid.</P>
      <P>Aside from the instruments themselves, the program also provides post-donation
services to understand if the receiver countries need supplies of medical

    <HEADLINE>Government to cancel ID application quota for Chinese spouses: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  29  (CNA)
12/29/08  20:49:53
(By Luis Yu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) announced Monday that the government will
cancel the current quota of 500 per month for applications by Chinese spouses
for Taiwanese ID cards.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior is drafting amendments to the existing quota
regulations, and once the new regulations take effect, the amount of time needed
for Chinese immigrant spouses to qualify for a Taiwanese ID card will be
shortened significantly, the MAC said in a statement.</P>
      <P>Under amended regulations, the statement said, Chinese spouses will also no
longer have to wait eight years to become eligible to apply for an ID in Taiwan,
compared to the four years for foreign spouses from other countries.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, those who have gained eligibility to obtain an ID card will not
have to wait eight to nine months before they receive them, as the ID
application quota of 6,000 per year for Chinese spouses will be lifted.</P>
      <P>Under the draft amendment Chinese spouses will also no longer have to wait 13
years before they can apply for Taiwan entry for their children, although there
will be a quota of just 60 persons per year.</P>
      <P>According to the present regulations, Chinese spouses have to be in Taiwan for
at least eight years before they can register their household here and another
five years after that before they can apply to get their children into Taiwan.
The draft amendment cancels the second five-year waiting period.</P>
      <P>Previous administrations have argued that the strict rules were imposed to curb
marriages of convenience and to keep Chinese women out of Taiwan, despite the
fact that Taiwanese men tend to marry Chinese women more than women from other
countries.</P>
      <P>During the previous Democratic Progressive Party administration, harsh
regulations governing Chinese spouses were put in place, including a requirement
that they provide documented proof of financial solvency when applying for a
Taiwanese ID.</P>
      <P>The Chinese spouses and non-government organizations representing them have long
blasted such policies as discriminatory, unreasonable and not in line with human
rights, as marriages of convenience also exist among spouses from other
countries, while the divorce rate of locals with Chinese spouses is about the
same as that of local Taiwanese couples.</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of the Interior, 399,000 foreign spouses were
registered in Taiwan as of the end of 2007 -- 262,000 from China and 137,000
from other countries.</P>

to prevent the crime from getting worse," he said.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lai Ching-te, a whip of the DPP legislative caucus who introduced a
draft bill of the act, also called for harsh penalties to fight human
trafficking.</P>
      <P>The draft bill would stipulate a sentence of seven years in prison, plus a fine
of NT$7 million (US$212,410), for smuggling foreign women into Taiwan to work as
prostitutes, and a 10-year sentence, plus a fine of NT$10 million, if such
smuggled women are under 18 years of age.</P>
      <P>National Immigration  Agency Director-General  Hsieh Li-Kung welcomed the
consensus among the lawmakers on heavy penalties for human traffickers.</P>
      <P>He said he was looking forward to an early adoption of the bill to fight the
crime, which he added is considered a felony anywhere in the world.</P>

      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) agreed Monday to a two-
year project that will help local authorities renovate or rebuild traditional
markets throughout Taiwan, government officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>The project, proposed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) to help boost
employment, will require a budget of around NT$4 billion (US$121 million) to
upgrade around 440 traditional markets across the country over the next two
years, ministry officials said.</P>
      <P>Apart from improving the safety and hygiene of aging traditional markets across
the country, the MOEA estimates that the project will safeguard the jobs of some

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy is likely to rebound in the middle of next year thanks to a
series of measures being adopted by the government to stimulate the economy,
President Ma Ying-jeou said in an exclusive interview with Web site Yahoo! Kimo
that will be posted in its news section Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Though he acknowledged that there is no "panacea" that will quickly turn around
the country's contracting economy, Ma said he believes the impact of the
government's stimulus measures will begin to be felt in the second quarter next
year.</P>
      <P>At a time when many workers have been laid off, the government should make
preparations and get ready for the next round of economic recovery, he said.</P>
      <P>Apart from more than 50,000 jobs opened by a temporary work creation project
launched by the Council of Labor Affairs in November, the government will also
put in place a separate employment program  next year that hopes to create
another 220,000  job opportunities.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, the government will invest NT$85 billion (US$2.58 billion)
in a consumption voucher program and another NT$270 billion on 12 national
infrastructure projects to get the economy going.</P>
      <P>The voucher program is a short-term policy designed to fuel economic activity in
the retail and restaurant sector in view of a sharp slump in private-sector
consumption, he explained.</P>
      <P>Ma admitted, however, that this kind of measure cannot be implemented every day,
and he said creating jobs and expanding infrastructure along with stepping up
private sector consumption were all crucial to reinvigorating Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Thanks to Taiwan's strategic location in East Asia and because of the
government's economic stimulus measures, the country's economy will definitely
take off at a rapid pace after the current economic recession comes to an end,
the president predicted.</P>
      <P>In terms of economic ties with China, Ma noted that the Dec. 15 establishment of
daily charter flights and the opening of shipping and postal links between
Taiwan and China has yet to positively impact Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>He said, however, that the new links will at least help shipping and aviation
companies reduce travel times and costs across the Taiwan Strait, and suggested
now was a good time for Taiwan's people to consider how the operating model for
the new one-day life circle across the Taiwan Strait will evolve.</P>
      <P>Ma is the third head of state interviewed by Yahoo after U. S. President George
W. Bush and South Korean President Lee Myung-bak.</P>
      <P>The questions directed to Ma in the interview were selected by a vote by more
than 10,000 Yahoo! Kimo users from over 100 inquires collected by its polling
center.</P>
      <P>The questions focused on economic issues of major public concern, including the
government's voucher program, consumer product price hikes and countermeasures
to tackle the current economic downturn.</P>
      <P>The interview will also be published by Yahoo! in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong,

    <HEADLINE>Ex-president's indictment chosen top 2008 Taiwan news story</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.29 (CNA)
12/29/08  22:37:06
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Dec. 12 indictment of former President Chen Shui-bian on corruption charges
has been selected by Taiwan's news agency as the top news event in the country
for 2008.</P>
      <P>The Central News Agency annually selects the year's top domestic news events.
For this year, the selection was based on events occurring up to Dec.12.</P>
      <P>A colorful and controversial figure in Taiwan politics, Chen faces charges that
he and his wife siphoned off special presidential funds for their personal use
during his presidency from 2000 to May of this year and pocketed tens of
millions of New Taiwan dollars in bribes.</P>
      <P>Chen was Taiwan's first former president to face criminal prosecution.
Prosecutors said they will ask the court to give him the harshest  punishment
because his crimes are major.  Chen,  a lawyer-turned-politician, has denied the
charges, dismissing his prosecution as a political persecution.</P>
      <P>Second on the top 10 list is the return to power of the Kuomintang (KMT)
following its landslide wins in both the Jan.12 legislative elections and the
March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The presidential poll marked the second time Taiwan's electorate had put the
opposition party in power in the country's history.</P>
      <P>Other news events that made the top 10 list are as follows in order of
importance:</P>
      <P>-- Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)  and China's Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) resumed dialogue in mid-June after a
nine-year hiatus.</P>
      <P>During their two rounds of talks in the past few months, SEF Chairman Chiang
Pin-kung and ARATS President Chen Yunlin signed six agreements to pave the way
for direct cross-strait transport and postal links.</P>
      <P>In November, Chen headed a high-profile delegation to visit Taipei, making him
the most senior People's Republic of China official ever to visit Taiwan. The
second Chiang-Chen meeting in Taipei was politically significant, with both
sides not denying each other and agreeing to expand exchanges.</P>
      <P>-- Former President Chen, in addition to facing charges of embezzling public
funds, made a public apology after admitting in August that his wife had wired a
portion of surplus campaign contributions abroad. The Special Investigation
Division under the Supreme Prosecutors  Office launched probes into alleged
money laundering  by Chen and his family  members  and during  the
investigation, many former government officials, including Chiou I-jen and Yeh
Sheng-mao, were taken into custody.</P>
      <P>-- Since the May 20 inauguration of the KMT administration, Taiwan's stock index
plunged from more than 9,200 points to far below the 10-year average of 6,560
and even continued its downward spiral toward a low of 4,000 points before
rebounding to hover around 4,300 points.</P>
      <P>-- Imports of toxic chemical melamine-tained milk powder and food ingredients
from China prompted the Department of Health to order removal of all products
containing those ingredients from local store shelves. Taiwan and China later
forged an emergency reporting mechanism for food safety concerns and Chinese
authorities offered an apology through its intermediary body over the incident
and promised to help local victims seek compensation.</P>
      <P>-- Ma Ying-jeou and Vincent Siew were sworn in as the Republic of China's new
president and vice president May 20. Ma called for speedy resumption of cross-
strait talks based on the so-called "1992 consensus" and pursued a "diplomatic
truce" to create a favorable climate for peaceful development of cross-Taiwan
Strait relations.</P>
      <P>-- The National Pension Act and the revised Labor Insurance Act cleared the
legislative floor, paving the way for implementation of the national pension
system in October 2008 and the new labor pension system Jan. 1, 2009.</P>
      <P>-- The exposure in May of a diplomatic scandal in which US$29.8 million in
diplomatic funds for establishing formal ties with Paupa New Guinea were
siphoned off by middlemen Ching Chi Ju and Wu Shih-Tsai led to the resignation
of then-Vice Premier Chiou I-jen and then-Foreign Minister James Huang. The key
suspect, Jin, remained abroad and judicial authorities are still probing the
case.</P>
      <P>-- KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung headed a delegation to visit China in late May,
during which he met with Communist Party of China General Secretary Hu Jintao,
who doubles as Chinese president. It marked the first time that the heads of the
ruling parties on both sides of the Taiwan Strait had met since the People's
Republic of China was established in 1949.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung District Court on Monday sentenced a former public prosecutor to
eight years and six months in prison on charges of corruption, forced sexual
intercourse, forced obscene acts and obstruction of personal freedom.</P>
      <P>Wu Chieh-jen, a prosecutor of the Kaohsiung Public Prosecutors Office, was found
guilty of committing the offenses against more than 10 women who were targets of
his investigations between 1999 and 2006.</P>
      <P>The court also decided to strip Wu of his citizen's rights for five years after
he finishes serving his prison term.</P>
      <P>The court ordered that before being put in jail, Wu should be subjected to
mandatory treatment for his deviant sexual urges.</P>
      <P>According to the prosecution, Wu used his influence as a prosecutor to coerce
the women to have sex with him and succeeded in compelling one of the women to
have sexual intercourse with him twice in June 2006.</P>
      <P>Chung Chung-hsiao,  a senior  prosecutor  of the Kaohsiung Prosecutors Office,
said that Wu had been suspended from office since he was first detained in
September 2006, and that in addition to the criminal proceedings, he was also
sent to the Control Yuan for possible impeachment, a case that has yet to be
decided.</P>

      <P>The minister of the Central Personnel Administration (CPA) advised President Ma
Ying-jeou on Monday to take a vacation, with Presidential Office records showing
he has yet to take a day off since taking power in May.</P>
      <P>Chen Ching-hsiou suggested the president take time off on a regular basis to
maintain his physical strength, citing the practice of the U.S. president, who
regularly spends weekends at Camp David.</P>
      <P>Chen said the CPA is working on regulations that would grant Taiwan's president,
vice president and premier at least seven days off a year, as no existing law on
public servants sets vacation time for senior officials.</P>
      <P>The issue sparked a predicably partisan debate at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) urged the president to
push himself to pay attention to his health.</P>
      <P>"We really hope our president will be in a good shape, " said KMT lawmaker Chang
Sho-wen. "If his (Ma's) health is in trouble, it means our country has trouble."</P>
      <P>Legislator Lai Ching-te of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party countered
that the plan to encourage the president to take a break as standard "ass-
kissing."</P>
      <P>"It is hard to imagine that government officials would be concerned about
whether or not Ma takes time off at a time when most people are worried about
losing their jobs and are having trouble staying afloat," Lai argued.</P>
      <P>A Presidential Office official countered that the issue was not about whether
the president can legally take time off, as existing regulations do not
explicitly prevent him from doing so, but whether Ma would even be willing to
take a break.</P>
      <P>The president is the one who is not willing to take leave even for one day, the
official said, adding: "It would be meaningless to let him have seven days off."</P>

      <P>About 110 Tibetan people who overstayed their visas will be granted temporary
alien residence certificates early next year, the National Immigration Agency
(NIA) said in a statement Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the statement, the NIA decided to offer overstaying Tibetans
temporary residence certificates after working with the Cabinet-level Mongolian
and Tibetan Affairs Commission (MTAC) in helping them resolve their current
difficulties out of human rights consideration.</P>
      <P>The NIA previously granted similar temporary residence permits to overstaying
Thai and Myanmar students from the Golden Triangle who are descendants of former
Kuomintang troops and have not been given citizenship of their respective
countries of residence.</P>
      <P>As of Monday, 107 Tibetans -- 79 males and 28 females, including three children
born to Tibetan couples in Taiwan -- had completed the registration  process
with  the  NIA for temporary  residence certificates.</P>
      <P>The NIA is scheduled to issue the certificates Jan. 9, with the MTAC
distributing those certificates to Tibetans on behalf of the NIA, the statement

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei District Court finally approved early Tuesday a request by
prosecutors to place former President Chen Shui-bian back in detention.</P>
      <P>After more than 10 hours of grueling hearing on the request presented by
prosecutors from the Special Investigation Division under the Supreme
Prosecutors Office, a panel of three judges ruled that Chen should be taken back
into custody.</P>
      <P>But judges said Chen will not be barred from visits by his family members and
lawyers during his detention.</P>
      <P>Chen, who was present at the hearing, was escorted to a detention center after
the ruling.</P>
      <P>It was the prosecutors' third attempt to have Chen taken back into custody after
another panel of three judges rejected their previous two attempts.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors, however, succeeded in getting the decisions revoked through
appeals to the Taiwan High Court.</P>
      <P>In their last appeal presented to the Taiwan High Court Dec. 25, the prosecutors
noted that they will soon begin to investigate several corruption cases
allegedly involving Chen and his wife in addition to the ones on which he has
already been indicted.</P>
      <P>If Chen is allowed to remain free, the prosecutors argued, some of the
witnesses, including three of his former close aides, might not dare to tell the
truth.</P>
      <P>In its previous two rulings Dec. 13 and Dec. 18, the Taipei District Court
ordered that Chen, who was detained Nov. 12, be released without bail following
his indictment along with 13 other people on charges of embezzlement, corruption
and money laundering.</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife are accused of siphoning off NT$104 million (US$3.12 million)
from a special Presidential Office discretionary fund during his presidency from
2000 to May of this year.</P>
      <P>They are also charged with accepting bribes worth NT$100 million and NT$200
million in connection with a land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million
in kickbacks to help a contractor win the tender for a government construction
project, according to the indictment.</P>

explicitly prevent him from doing so, but whether Ma would even be willing to
take a break.</P>
      <P>The president is the one who is not willing to take leave even for one day, the

      <P>About 110 Tibetan people who overstayed their visas will be granted temporary
alien residence certificates early next year, the National Immigration Agency
(NIA) said in a statement Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the statement, the NIA decided to offer overstaying Tibetans
temporary residence certificates after working with the Cabinet-level Mongolian
and Tibetan Affairs Commission (MTAC) in helping them resolve their current
difficulties out of human rights consideration.</P>
      <P>The NIA previously granted similar temporary residence permits to overstaying
Thai and Myanmar students from the Golden Triangle who are descendants of former
Kuomintang troops and have not been given citizenship of their respective
countries of residence.</P>
      <P>As of Monday, 107 Tibetans -- 79 males and 28 females, including three children
born to Tibetan couples in Taiwan -- had completed the registration  process
with  the  NIA for temporary  residence certificates.</P>
      <P>The NIA is scheduled to issue the certificates Jan. 9, with the MTAC
distributing those certificates to Tibetans on behalf of the NIA, the statement

    <HEADLINE>Former president admits to lie about secret diplomacy</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  30  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian has admitted that he lied to a prosecutor about
a so-called secret diplomatic mission that he claimed was financed by the
president's "state affairs fund."</P>
      <P>Chen made the confession in a marathon hearing held Monday at the Taipei
District Court on a request by prosecutors to take the former president back
into custody. A panel of three judges ruled in the prosecutors' favor at the
conclusion of the hearing early Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen told the presiding judge that when questioned by prosecutor Chen Jui-jen in
2006, he falsely stated that he used money from the "state affairs fund" on a
"south line" secret diplomatic mission targeting Australia, when the money in
fact was used on another secret project.</P>
      <P>Chen said he had to do so to prevent the mission from being made public in the
name of the country's national interests and that he was sorry for not telling
the truth.</P>
      <P>The former president, who was last detained Nov. 12, was released Dec. 13
following his indictment along with 13 other people on charges of embezzlement,
corruption and money laundering.</P>
      <P>The court ruled early Tuesday that he should be taken back into custody on
grounds that he is likely to flee, destroy or forge evidence, and collude with
other co-conspirators.</P>
      <P>The court pointed out that in an attempt to erase evidence of money laundering,
Chen had refused to return a file submitted to him by former Investigation
Bureau head Yeh Sheng-mao, which contained information of his family's overseas
fund transfers.</P>
      <P>With NT$570 million (US$17.27 million) of possible illicit gains remaining
unaccounted for, chances were high that Chen could make off with the fortune to
evade trial and a possible imprisonment, the court determined.</P>
      <P>Also, Chen had previously colluded with others involved in his case to make
false statements and had attempted to delay a probe into the "state affairs
fund" case by classifying materials held by prosecutors as evidence, according
to the court.</P>
      <P>Chen, however, denied he had any intention of interfering with judicial
proceedings.</P>
      <P>Chen also denied he has attempted to conceal evidence, noting that his son Chen
Chih-chung and daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching -- who acted respectively as the
proxy and a nominal holder of the former first family's overseas bank accounts
-- have agreed to disclose the whereabouts of the NT$570 million mentioned by
the court and transfer the money back to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, the Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutors Office
that is in charge of the cases has not responded to their offer, according to
Chen.</P>
      <P>On this issue,  Chen Yun-nan,  spokesman  for the Special Investigation
Division, said the couple should make the offer in a plea bargain during the
trial now that they have been indicted.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian and his wife Wu Shu-jen are accused of siphoning off NT$104
million from a special Presidential Office discretionary fund during his
presidency from 2000 to May of this year.</P>
      <P>They are also charged with accepting bribes worth NT$100 million and NT$200
million in connection with a land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million
in kickbacks to help a contractor win the tender for a government construction
project.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan will not propose WHA bid at WHO board meeting: MOFA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will not try to have its bid for observer status at the World Health
Assembly placed on the assembly's provisional  agenda at next month's  World
Health Organization executive board meeting, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Paul Chang,  the director-general  of MOFA's Department of International
Organization, said the ministry will instead focus on getting its bid on the
WHA's supplemental agenda when it meets in May.</P>
      <P>After an overall evaluation and considering the improvement in cross-strait
relations, we think the issue is better left for private negotiation than public
confrontation, as it is more beneficial for us to achieve the goal,Chang said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan had not tried to bring up the observership issue at the
executive board meeting every year, Chang said the strategy was suggested by the
United States and Japan, which openly support observer status for Taiwan in the
WHA, the WHO's highest decision-making body.</P>
      <P>The executive board, which is scheduled to be meet in Geneva Jan. 19-27, is
composed of 34 individuals technically qualified in the health field.</P>
      <P>Each person is designated by a member state elected to the board, which sets the
provisional agenda for the health assembly and generally facilitates its work.
Member states are elected to three-year terms.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Taiwan will propose a resolution seeking WHO membership, Chang
replied that,our aim is crystal clear, which is to apply for observer status at
the WHA.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan will continue to communicate with China and other major
countries on the issue before making a proposal at the health assembly in May.</P>
      <P>Chang would not disclose in what capacity Taiwan plans to push its bid for
observership, saying only that many options were being considered,  including
joining as a health entity or through meaningful participation.</P>
      <P>He stressed, however, that the foreign ministry would not consider applying to
the WHO as an associate member of China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has tried, without success because of interference from China, to gain
entry to the WHA as an observer under its official title, the Republic of China,
since 1997.</P>
      <P>Last year, it applied for full WHO membership asTaiwanfor the first time, but
the bid failed again due to opposition from Beijing, which claimed that Taiwan
is part of its territory and not a sovereign state as required for WHO
membership.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Japanese who had been searching for his former nanny in Taiwan for a long time
had a warm reunion with her Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The 66-year-old man, Kenji Okuzono, met with Lin Shui-juan, 82, for the first
time in more than 60 years at the office of the Changhua County government,
which helped to arrange the meeting.</P>
      <P>Okuzono expressed his heartfelt appreciation to Lin and her elder sister, who
has since passed away, for taking care of him when he was a child.</P>
      <P>He said that he was only three years old when he lived in Taiwan and he had no
memory of Lin and her sister. But "at the urging of my mother that I should
locate them and express my appreciation, I embarked on this journey," he said.</P>
      <P>Lin said that Okuzono's appearance has changed completely from when he was a
child, but that when she saw him she experienced a sense of closeness.</P>
      <P>Okuzono said that when he returns to Japan, he will work hard to save enough
money to treat Lin to a trip to Japan so she and his mother could see each other
again.</P>
      <P>As a child, Okuzono lived in Hemei township, Changhua County. His father was
serving as a policeman in Taiwan at the time.</P>
      <P>He said that after his father's death, his mother often spoke about their life
in Taiwan and the care Lin took of him. He therefore wanted to visit Taiwan to
fulfill his mother's wishes, he added.</P>
      <P>Armed with only an old photo and an old address, he first solicited assistance
from the Osaka office of the semi-official Taiwan External Trade Development
Council.</P>
      <P>Through the council, he sought further help from the offices of land
administration in Hemei, Yuanlin and Lukang to check the land administration
documents and other data from the Japanese colonial era, which helped him to

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is currently discussing the issue of its representation in the World
Health Assembly (WHA) with China, President Ma Ying-jeou said in an interview
with Web site Yahoo! Kimo that was posted on the Internet Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"We are in fact consulting with the other side of the Taiwan Strait on this
issue. They are willing to discuss this issue with us," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Expressing  his hope that Taiwan's  representation  in the decision-making body
of the World Health Organization can be settled before the WHA General Assembly
meets in May, Ma stressed that it will require a great deal of effort to achieve
the goal.</P>
      <P>"As long as the two sides do not deny each other, room can be created for both
to hold bilateral negotiations on many issues, " the president said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's repeated bids to join the WHA as an observer since 1997 have failed
because of China's objections. Taiwan changed its strategy in 2007, applying for
membership using the name "Taiwan, " but that attempt was also blocked by
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Ma believed, however, that focusing on the possible and skirting the sovereignty
issue would help advance the process, as was the case in dealing with China's
offer of two giant pandas to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the case of the pandas, Ma described the crux of the issue as ensuring that
the animals could be exported from China and imported into Taiwan through due
process.</P>
      <P>"Our attention was not focused on whether it was an international or domestic
transfer," Ma argued.</P>
      <P>Turning to Taiwan's desire to take part in the United Nations, the president
believed the sovereignty dispute remains the prime hurdle.</P>
      <P>"The sovereignty issue is even more difficult to resolve than the defense issue,
" Ma said. "What we should do on the current stage is remove barriers created by
the problem rather than try to solve it. "</P>
      <P>He also acknowledged that some of Taiwan's people are concerned about the
potential negative impact of a quick improvement in relations between Taiwan and
China, but he brushed aside the view, saying that it was held by "only a
minority of the people."</P>
      <P>According to the president, many of Taiwan's diplomatic allies, U.S. government
officials and think tank members have been pleased to see an improved situation
across the Taiwan Strait, which they believe will help lead to peace and
prosperity in the region.</P>
      <P>Ma said he believes that U.S. President-elect Barack Obama will continue
supporting these policies conducive to development in East Asia, following in
the steps of his predecessors.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Tuesday that Singapore has agreed to Taiwan's
appointment of Vanessa Yea-ping Shih, incumbent minister of Government
Information Office (GIO), to be Taiwans new representative to the Southeast
Asian city state.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks in response to reporters' questions earlier Tuesday at the
Executive Yuan's year-end news conference, saying that this (appointment) can be
said is certain.</P>
      <P>Shih  will  be  the  third  member  of the  Ma Ying-jeou administration's
Cabinet to step down since the new government took power on May 20.</P>
      <P>Asked by reporters whether there will be a major cabinet reshuffle, Liu simply
said thatthere is no timetable for that.</P>
      <P>The reassignment of Shih as representative to Singapore was confirmed by the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) Tuesday afternoon through a text message.</P>
      <P>The post has been vacant for three months since Kuo Shih-nan, who was appointed
by the previous  Democratic  Progressive  Party administration, resigned in
September.</P>
      <P>Shih used to serve as deputy  director-general  of MOFA's Department of Protocol
and deputy representative to Australia.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Henry Chen said that Shih will be transferred back to the foreign
ministry to complete official procedures and will assume her new post as soon as
possible.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan announced later Tuesday Shih's appointment, naming Su Jun-

government, to be her successor.</P>
      <P>Su used to be the vice chairman of the Kuomintang Cultural Affairs Committee and

    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairwoman of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) questioned
Tuesday the decision to detain former President Chen Shui-bian for a second time
and asked the authorities to explain to the public the judicial grounds for the
ruling.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ing-wen made the remarks at a joint press conference with DPP legislators
Lai Ching-te, Gao Jyh-peng and Yeh Yi-jin at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, a collegial panel at the Taipei District Court approved
prosecutors' request to detain Chen, but ruled that visits by his family, party
members and lawyers will not be banned.</P>
      <P>It was the third attempt  by prosecutors  of the Special Investigation Division
under the Supreme Prosecutor Office to have the former president taken back into
custody after he was freed by another panel of judges on Dec. 13.</P>
      <P>Tsai criticized the practice of "detaining suspects before trial, " saying it
has become a frequent strategy and the main one employed by investigators in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>She also expressed regret that Chen was handcuffed on his way to jail, saying
that this represented a failure to protect his human rights as he is suspect who
has not yet been brought to trial and is unlikely to flee the country.</P>
      <P>The chairwoman also suggested that the judicial system may have been tainted by
political influence after the judges in Chen's case were replaced last week by a
new panel headed by Tsai Shou-hsun.</P>
      <P>Tsai Shou-hsun was the chief justice in an embezzlement case against former
first lady Wu Shu-chen.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ing-wen said the DPP hopes the former president will be brave in the face
of his challenges and that he will be given a fair trial.</P>
      <P>Many people, including DPP members and Chen's supporters, have raised a number
of questions pertaining to the case, the DPP chairwoman said, adding that the
authorities, particularly the Judicial Yuan, owe the people a clear explanation.</P>
      <P>If the government fails to address the concerns of the people and the flaws in
the judicial system, this will result in wider divisions in the society, she
said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the chairwoman called for DPP supporters to remain calm, saying
that if there is no other recourse, "we will express our strong feelings in an
appropriate way."</P>
      <P>Asked whether that means the DPP will stage street protests, Tsai said "it is
not about whether or not the DPP will take to the streets, " but about how the
society feels about the Chen matter and the discrepancy between the people's
expectations and government's actions.</P>
      <P>The people have been disappointed, she stated.</P>
      <P>Asked whether she will visit Chen at the Taipei Detention Center in Tucheng,
Taipei County, Tsai said she did not plan to do so immediately, but "will see
what has to be done."</P>
      <P>On Dec 13, the court ordered that Chen, who was taken into custody by
prosecutors Nov. 12, be released without bail following his indictment on
charges of embezzlement, corruption and money laundering. He is Taiwan's first
former president to face criminal prosecution.</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife are accused of siphoning off NT$104 million (US$3.12 million)
from a special Presidential Office discretionary fund during his presidency from
2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>They are also charged with accepting bribes worth NT$300 million in total in
connection with a land procurement deal and another NT$90.93 million in
kickbacks to help a contractor win the tender for a government construction
project, according to the indictment.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday that freedom and democracy, which are
pivotal to Taiwan's existence and development, can serve as Taiwan's "soft
power" in its relationship with China.</P>
      <P>"In order to achieve the goal of preventing war, resolute defense can serve the
purpose, with effective deterrence being the means," Ma said in an address at a
ceremony to promote a group of 33 officers from the Army, Navy and Air Force to
ranks as generals.</P>
      <P>However, Ma noted that viewed from the nation's overall strategy, the deterrence
should be formed by the nation's strength in all areas,  including politics, the
economy, the military and the psychology of the people.</P>
      <P>Quoting from "The Art of War" -- a classic book written by renowned military
strategist Sun Tzu more than 2,500 years ago -- Ma said, "The highest form of
generalship is to balk the enemy's plans; the next best is to prevent the
junction of the enemy's forces; the next in order is to attack the enemy's army
in the field; and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities."</P>
      <P>"In other words, politically we need to deepen Taiwan's democracy and manifest
Taiwan's freedom -- the two values vital to Taiwan's existence and development,"
he said, adding that democracy and freedom are also Taiwan's important soft-
power  assets in its relationship with China.</P>
      <P>Soft power is a term coined by Harvard professor Joseph Nye in 1990 to describe
a country's ability to lead by example and influence the behavior or interests
of other political bodies through cultural or ideological means.</P>
      <P>President  Ma also said that cross-Taiwan  Strait economic exchanges in the past
20 years have proved to be beneficial to both Taiwan and China and that people
in Taiwan should have confidence in themselves with regard to increased
interaction between the two sides.</P>
      <P>"We have the good systems and strength envied by other people around the world,
and we hold the necessary advantage in the cross-strait competition," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Since beginning his term in office in May, Ma has pushed for a warming of ties
between China and Taiwan,  which the Chinese government still considers a
province awaiting reunification, by force if necessary.</P>
      <P>Ma's policies to improve relations with China, especially to build closer
economic ties, have worried the pro-independence segment of the population in
Taiwan who fear that the island could suffer from an influx of cheap Chinese
labor and products, and can lose its sovereignty and self-rule.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CO2 levels higher than acceptable in most Taipei department stores</HEADLINE>

      <P>Carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in 50 percent of the department stores and
shopping malls in the Greater Taipei area have exceeded the acceptable level of
1,000 parts per million (ppm) , according to a survey released by the Consumers'
Foundation Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted between Dec. 20 and Dec.21, found that CO2 levels in the
National Palace Museum, Shin Kong Mitsukoshi Department Store's Taipei Train
Station store, and the Taipei World Trade Center Hall 3 were detected to be
among the highest, all exceeding 1,501 ppm.</P>
      <P>Levels of CO2 in the Pacific Sogo Department Store's Jhongsiao store, the Guang
Hua Digital Plaza, and Taipei's largest underground mall--the Taipei City Mall--
as well as the National Museum of History stood between 1,000 ppm and 1,500 ppm.</P>
      <P>According to the Environmental Protection Administration's (EPA)
recommendations, the average concentrations of indoor CO2 over an eight-hour
period should be maintained at or below 1,000 ppm.</P>
      <P>High occupancy density, improper utilization of air-conditioning systems, and
poor air circulation or ventilation are among the reasons why concentrations in
many indoor spaces in Taiwan are higher than acceptable, according to the EPA.</P>
      <P>Those indoor spaces include office buildings, department stores, movie theaters,
restaurants, shopping centers, public transport stations, cars, boats, and
airplanes.</P>
      <P>Since people spend about 90 percent of their time indoors, it is important to do
everything possible to maintain the quality of indoor air, the EPA said.</P>
      <P>If indoor CO2 levels rise above 800 ppm, many people would feel uncomfortable,
dizzy, weak and have headaches, according to the Consumers' Foundation's Deputy
Secretary-General Wu Chia-cheng.</P>
      <P>Once the concentrations are above 1,000 ppm, it would probably have an adverse
effect on people's respiratory and brain functions and circulatory systems, Wu
said.</P>
      <P>On Monday, the Legislative Yuan reviewed a draft bill on indoor air quality
management, which stipulates that environmental agencies can conduct unscheduled
inspections of indoor public places and request those who fail to meet standards
to make improvements before giving a deadline.</P>
      <P>Those failing to make improvements could be fined NT$50,000 to NT$250,000, or
face the risk of being banned from using public spaces or being ordered to halt
their business.</P>
      <P>The bill was approve by the Executive Yuan on Oct. 15 this year and is pending
legislative approval.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) announced Tuesday that a program to train host
families will begin next year with the aim of offering  foreign students a
deeper cultural experience and improving the country's international image.</P>
      <P>With more and more foreign students coming to Taiwan, the MOE said, it has set
up a system, in collaboration with non-profit organizations, to prepare host
families to provide foreign students with a friendlier environment in which to
learn Mandarin and to become familiar with the local customs and culture.</P>
      <P>Local families with regular incomes, willing to provide free accommodation to
foreign students for a short period, and enthusiastic about cultural exchanges
are eligible to apply for participation in the "Host Taiwan" program.</P>
      <P>The families should be capable of providing adequate accommodation and at least
one member of each applying household must speak a foreign language.</P>
      <P>The host applicants must be recommended by a public or private school or a non-
profit organization, such as a church or Rotary Club.</P>
      <P>The foreign students will have fewer expenses while studying in Taiwan,  while
the host families  will also benefit from the arrangement, according to the MOE.</P>
      <P>Next year, 1,000 host families are expected to enroll in the program, said
Deputy Education Minister Lu Mu-lin at a press conference.</P>
      <P>Ted Liang, a Rotary Club member who has hosted four foreign students so far,
said hosting young people from different countries helped his own children to
gain the concept of a global village, to express themselves better and to
develop other interests apart from their studies.</P>
      <P>"Hosting foreign students and having contact with other cultures changed the way
we educate our children, " Liang said, adding that this type of exchange is also
a form of citizen diplomacy.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan voiced confidence in Taiwan's future Tuesday and pledged
to effectively sharpen the country's competitive edge and use well-crafted
policies to make it a front runner to embrace a global economic recovery.</P>
      <P>Despite the many challenging tasks arising from a global economic downturn since
he assumed office in May, Liu told a year-end news conference at the Executive
Yuan that the key mission of the Cabinet currently is to foster Taiwan's
strength and get the country ready for international competition when the global
economy rebounds.</P>
      <P>Liu expressed his hope that government policies focusing on the economy, energy,
talent training and ecology conservation can be fully implemented in the near
future.</P>
      <P>Commenting on speculation over a Cabinet reshuffle, the premier said there is no
timetable for possible changes in this regard, while promising to pay attention
to Cabinet members who might make verbal bounders.</P>
      <P>Liu also took the opportunity to recount the major measures adopted by the
government with an aim to combat the financial woes over the past seven months,
including the launching of a new labor insurance pension system and national
pension program, relaxation of cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges, introduction of a
spending voucher plan and a program to create temporary jobs, among others.</P>
      <P>To prop up Taiwan's economy, Liu said, the government will focus its efforts on
expanding infrastructure  projects,  encouraging consumer spending and boosting
employment.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, the government will also designate a special trade and
economic zone next year for returning Taiwanese businessmen who hope to channel
their capital into Taiwan from abroad, particularly those based in China.</P>
      <P>Liu said the plan to set up such a zone targeting returning Taiwan business
people has come at a good time as direct daily charter flight services and
direct shipping and postal links have been put in place between Taiwan and China
since Dec. 15, implying that this will make it easier for the investors to do
business both in China and in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The government will officially unveil the plan to the public after it has been
comprehensively hammered out by the end of this year, he added.</P>
      <P>Export-dependent and manufacturing-focused Taiwan is suffering from the current
global economic downturn, with the island's economy contracting 1.02 percent in
the third quarter from a year ago -- its first decline since 2003. Gross
domestic product is projected to shrink 1.73 percent in the fourth quarter and
drop by 0.31 percent in the first quarter of 2009, compared to a growth rate of
5.7 percent in 2007.</P>
      <P>Unemployment for November has meanwhile reached seasonally- adjusted 4.62
percent -- a nearly five-year high, while exports in November fell by an annual
23 percent -- the sharpest decline in seven years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Israel will defend its people at all costs: Israeli representative</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  30 (CNA)
12/30/08  21:17:03
(By Luis Yu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Raphael Gamzou, the head of the Israel Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei
(ISECO) , said at a press conference Friday that Israel is prepared to defend
its people at all costs in response to the rocket attacks launched by the ruling
Islamic militant group Hamas in the Gaza Strip.</P>
      <P>Gamzou, Israel's top representative to Taiwan, said it is important that the
Taiwanese people understand Israel's struggle, as no one is inmune from
extremist terrorism.</P>
      <P>"The recent Mumbai attacks on foreign citizens by terrorist organizations is an
example of what the Israeli people have endured in the past seven years," said
Gamzou.</P>
      <P>According to the Israeli representative, intense levels of rocket fire against
the Israeli city of Sderot and the area of the Western Negev began in January
2001, and continue to this very day.</P>
      <P>As of January 2008, over 8,000 rockets had been launched by terrorists in Gaza
at Sderot and Western Negev, causing significant damage to homes and property,
while injuring 583 Israeli residents and traumatizing thousands of adults and
children, according to Gamzou.</P>
      <P>Approximately 2.5 kilometers outside of Western Negev, Sderot is on the
receiving end of a large number of rocket attacks from Gaza, said Gamzou.</P>
      <P>Describing the suffering of the residents in the area over the past seven years,
Gamzou said that of the 28 deaths from terrorist rocket fire in Western Negev
since 2001, nine victims were Sderot residents, three of whom were children.
Thousands of Sderot residents have relocated from the city out of fear for their
lives and their children's lives, he added.</P>
      <P>"Whoever heard Hamas's statements understood that they decided to increase the
attacks on the residents of Israel by firing rockets and mortars
indiscriminately," said Gamzou, adding that Israel had no alternative but to
respond.</P>
      <P>Gamzou stressed that while Israel does not rejoice in battle, it will not be
deterred from it.</P>
      <P>Quoting a passage from the Bible -- "Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth" --
Gamzou said that many of the terrorists are children who have been brainwashed
and manipulated by cruel and cynical leaders.</P>
      <P>According to ISECO, for approximately seven years, hundreds of thousands of
Israeli citizens living in the southern cities of the country, adjacent to the
Gaza Strip, have been suffering as a result of missiles being fired at them by
Hamas terrorists.</P>
      <P>"I urge the Taiwanese people not to be fooled by the cheap terrorist propaganda
of a humanitarian disaster in the area, as we will see to the needs of the
population in Gaza and will do our best to prevent a humanitarian crisis that
will impinge upon residents' lives," said Gamzou.</P>
      <P>Being in the front line of the war against terrorism and the only democratic
free society in the Middle East, Israel needs the support of the international
community in its struggle to achieve peace and coexistence with the Palestinian
people in the area, Gamzou said.</P>
      <P>Israel is not at war with the Arab world -- the Islamic, the Muslim or the
Palestinian people -- as its main targets are Iranian-funded extremist
organizations such as the Hamas terrorist organizations and the Islamic Jihad,
he said.</P>
      <P>The current Israeli military operation in the Gaza strip is designed, first and
foremost, to bring about an improvement in the security reality for the
residents of the southern part of Israel, he added.</P>
      <P>"We did everything in our power to fulfill the conditions of the calm in the
south and enable normal life for citizens in the communities adjacent to the
Gaza Strip, but the peace and quiet we offered was returned by Hamas' shelling,"
said Gamzou.</P>
      <P>Asked about Palestinian civilian casualties in the conflict, Gamzou said the
Israeli forces are focusing only on military and terrorist targets, but its hard
to avoid some "collateral damage", especially when the Hamas militants use their
own citizens as human shields.</P>

      <P>The Department of Social Welfare (DSW) under the Taipei city government said
Tuesday that the economic downturn has led to more people becoming homeless,
many of whom are younger people, which requires a change in the nature of the
department's work and an increased budget.</P>
      <P>According to Chung Pei-chen, a section chief of the Division of Social Work
under the DSW, there are more vagrants in the capital than there were three
years ago, with the average age having dropped.</P>
      <P>She noted that there were around 300 homeless people in Taipei City three years
ago, most of whom were aged between 50 and 60.</P>
      <P>The number has increased to 500, she went on, adding that the number of homeless
people in their 40s still capable of working has increased.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, the task of our division has turned from lodging homeless people to
encouraging them to earn their own livings and helping them find employment, "
Chung told CNA, adding that the task is not easy, especially with the high
unemployment rate.</P>
      <P>The Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics reported that
Taiwan's unemployment rate had soared to 4.64 percent as of November,
representing 507,000 jobless people.</P>
      <P>As the number of homeless people increases, the problem of a lack of social
workers and budget has emerged, said Chung.</P>
      <P>She added that the only two reception centers for homeless people in Taipei have
only 113 beds and that her agency is trying to map out plans to help lodge other
homeless people, which might require several million dollars, while last year,
her section had only NT$700,000 to spend on issues related to the homeless.</P>
      <P>"Building another reception center is almost impossible because of pressure from
the public," she said.</P>
      <P>Chung said her unit began regular visits to homeless people in Taipei City this
year in mid-November when temperatures began to drop.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is trying to have the traditional Chinese character set used in Taiwan
listed as a world heritage item, and an Executive Yuan official in charge of the
mission said Tuesday that the goal might be achieved soon if China agrees to
help.</P>
      <P>Minister without Portfolio Ovid J.L. Tzeng made the remarks in response to media
inquiries after a year-end Executive Yuan press conference held that day.</P>
      <P>Describing traditional Chinese as an important cultural asset of mankind, Tzeng

      <P>According to Tzeng, people from other cultures "might be amazed that Taiwanese
people in the modern era can communicate with ancient people living 2000 years

      <P>While the government is outlining plans for the application submission, it
believes that if China can help, it would resolve some tough challenges, such as
Taiwan's not being part of the United Nations, Tzeng said.</P>
      <P>Tzeng said China will not be opposed to the idea of letting traditional Chinese

      <P>The hotel management agreed that the 108 workers of the club will be moved to

      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lee Ching-an announced her decision Tuesday
to withdraw from the party over a controversy surrounding her citizenship.</P>
      <P>Lee, who voluntarily suspended her legislator status on Dec. 25 over the dual
citizenship dispute, said in a statement that although U.S. authorities have yet
to release the "final outcome" of their investigation into her U.S. citizenship
status, she has decided to quit the KMT lest the issue tarnish the party's
reputation.</P>
      <P>Lee's eligibility as a legislator has been challenged since it was reported
early this year that she never officially renounced her U.S. citizenship even
though she had been in public office in Taiwan since 1994.</P>
      <P>The Nationality Act forbids Republic of China nationals who hold foreign
citizenship  from assuming  public office and requires officials holding foreign
citizenship to be removed from their posts.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has been urging the KMT, which
holds more than a two-thirds majority in the legislature, not to continue to
cover up what it called Lee's violation of the nationality regulations.</P>
      <P>As Lee can only be stripped of her legislative seat in this case by a majority
vote in the lawmaking body, she opted to voluntarily surrender her KMT
membership to safeguard the reputation of her party.</P>
      <P>Upon learning of Lee's renunciation of her party membership, Juan Kang-meng,
head of the KMT's Evaluation and Discipline Committee, said the committee will
meet Wednesday as originally scheduled, but the agenda will focus on general
party issues instead of a review of Lee's case.</P>
      <P>Ruan said he believes Lee made the decision to quit the party mainly because she
does not want to see the party's reputation damaged as result of the controversy
over the dual citizenship issue.</P>
      <P>Lee admitted that she obtained U.S. citizenship in 1991, but argued that she
"legally" lost her status as a U.S. citizen when she was sworn in as a Taipei
city councilor in 1994, citing U.S. law which lists serving in a foreign
government as one of the legal conditions for the loss of citizenship.</P>
      <P>Under pressure from the DPP, the Legislative Yuan requested the MOFA in May to
help verify with foreign governments whether any of the sitting legislators were
holding dual citizenship.</P>
      <P>The MOFA received a reply from the U.S. in early December and the letter was
distributed as a classified document to all legislators Dec. 24.</P>
      <P>While saying there is no record of loss of U.S. citizenship by Lee, the letter
also states that "U.S. citizens who hold the citizenship of a foreign country
and who accept employment with the government of that country that requires an
oath, affirmation or declaration of allegiance may have committed an
expatriating act if they do so with the intent to relinquish their U.S.
citizenship."</P>
      <P>"While the Department (of State) has not made any determination regarding loss
of citizenship for the individual named above, it could do so based on evidence
that he or she committed a potentially expatriating  act  with  the intention
of relinquishing  U.S. citizenship. Any such determination would be retroactive
to the date of the expatriating act," the letter reads.</P>
      <P>On Dec.25, Lee claimed that a report on her U.S. citizenship status delivered
recently by the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) to the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs on her case was "not final" and urged the public to wait for the final
result before censuring her.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CO2 levels higher than acceptable in most Taipei department stores</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 30 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in 50 percent of the department stores and
shopping malls in the Greater Taipei area have exceeded the acceptable level of
1,000 parts per million (ppm) , according to a survey released by the Consumers'
Foundation Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted between Dec. 20 and Dec.21, found that CO2 levels in the
National Palace Museum, Shin Kong Mitsukoshi Department Store's Taipei Train
Station store, and the Taipei World Trade Center Hall 3 were detected to be
among the highest, all exceeding 1,501 ppm.</P>
      <P>Levels of CO2 in the Pacific Sogo Department Store's Jhongsiao store, the Guang
Hua Digital Plaza, and Taipei's largest underground mall--the Taipei City Mall--
as well as the National Museum of History stood between 1,000 ppm and 1,500 ppm.</P>
      <P>According to the Environmental Protection Administration's (EPA)
recommendations, the average concentrations of indoor CO2 over an eight-hour
period should be maintained at or below 1,000 ppm.</P>
      <P>High occupancy density, improper utilization of air-conditioning systems, and
poor air circulation or ventilation are among the reasons why concentrations in
many indoor spaces in Taiwan are higher than acceptable, according to the EPA.</P>
      <P>Those indoor spaces include office buildings, department stores, movie theaters,
restaurants, shopping centers, public transport stations, cars, boats, and
airplanes.</P>
      <P>Since people spend about 90 percent of their time indoors, it is important to do
everything possible to maintain the quality of indoor air, the EPA said.</P>
      <P>If indoor CO2 levels rise above 800 ppm, many people would feel uncomfortable,
dizzy, weak and have headaches, according to the Consumers' Foundation's Deputy
Secretary-General Wu Chia-cheng.</P>
      <P>Once the concentrations are above 1,000 ppm, it would probably have an adverse
effect on people's respiratory and brain functions and circulatory systems, Wu
said.</P>
      <P>On Monday, the Legislative Yuan reviewed a draft bill on indoor air quality
management, which stipulates that environmental agencies can conduct unscheduled
inspections of indoor public places and request those who fail to meet standards
to make improvements before giving a deadline.</P>
      <P>Those failing to make improvements could be fined NT$50,000 to NT$250,000, or
face the risk of being banned from using public spaces or being ordered to halt
their business.</P>
      <P>The bill was approve by the Executive Yuan on Oct. 15 this year and is pending
legislative approval.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) announced Tuesday that a program to train host
families will begin next year with the aim of offering  foreign students a
deeper cultural experience and improving the country's international image.</P>
      <P>With more and more foreign students coming to Taiwan, the MOE said, it has set
up a system, in collaboration with non-profit organizations, to prepare host
families to provide foreign students with a friendlier environment in which to
learn Mandarin and to become familiar with the local customs and culture.</P>
      <P>Local families with regular incomes, willing to provide free accommodation to
foreign students for a short period, and enthusiastic about cultural exchanges
are eligible to apply for participation in the "Host Taiwan" program.</P>
      <P>The families should be capable of providing adequate accommodation and at least
one member of each applying household must speak a foreign language.</P>
      <P>The host applicants must be recommended by a public or private school or a non-
profit organization, such as a church or Rotary Club.</P>
      <P>The foreign students will have fewer expenses while studying in Taiwan,  while
the host families  will also benefit from the arrangement, according to the MOE.</P>
      <P>Next year, 1,000 host families are expected to enroll in the program, said
Deputy Education Minister Lu Mu-lin at a press conference.</P>
      <P>Ted Liang, a Rotary Club member who has hosted four foreign students so far,
said hosting young people from different countries helped his own children to
gain the concept of a global village, to express themselves better and to
develop other interests apart from their studies.</P>
      <P>"Hosting foreign students and having contact with other cultures changed the way
we educate our children, " Liang said, adding that this type of exchange is also
a form of citizen diplomacy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier confident in Taiwan, sets agenda for 2009</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan voiced confidence in Taiwan's future Tuesday and pledged
to effectively sharpen the country's competitive edge and use well-crafted
policies to make it a front runner to embrace a global economic recovery.</P>
      <P>Despite the many challenging tasks arising from a global economic downturn since
he assumed office in May, Liu told a year-end news conference at the Executive
Yuan that the key mission of the Cabinet currently is to foster Taiwan's
strength and get the country ready for international competition when the global
economy rebounds.</P>
      <P>Liu expressed his hope that government policies focusing on the economy, energy,
talent training and ecology conservation can be fully implemented in the near
future.</P>
      <P>Commenting on speculation over a Cabinet reshuffle, the premier said there is no
timetable for possible changes in this regard, while promising to pay attention
to Cabinet members who might make verbal bounders.</P>
      <P>Liu also took the opportunity to recount the major measures adopted by the
government with an aim to combat the financial woes over the past seven months,
including the launching of a new labor insurance pension system and national
pension program, relaxation of cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges, introduction of a
spending voucher plan and a program to create temporary jobs, among others.</P>
      <P>To prop up Taiwan's economy, Liu said, the government will focus its efforts on
expanding infrastructure  projects,  encouraging consumer spending and boosting
employment.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, the government will also designate a special trade and
economic zone next year for returning Taiwanese businessmen who hope to channel
their capital into Taiwan from abroad, particularly those based in China.</P>
      <P>Liu said the plan to set up such a zone targeting returning Taiwan business
people has come at a good time as direct daily charter flight services and
direct shipping and postal links have been put in place between Taiwan and China
since Dec. 15, implying that this will make it easier for the investors to do
business both in China and in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The government will officially unveil the plan to the public after it has been
comprehensively hammered out by the end of this year, he added.</P>
      <P>Export-dependent and manufacturing-focused Taiwan is suffering from the current
global economic downturn, with the island's economy contracting 1.02 percent in
the third quarter from a year ago -- its first decline since 2003. Gross
domestic product is projected to shrink 1.73 percent in the fourth quarter and
drop by 0.31 percent in the first quarter of 2009, compared to a growth rate of
5.7 percent in 2007.</P>
      <P>Unemployment for November has meanwhile reached seasonally- adjusted 4.62
percent -- a nearly five-year high, while exports in November fell by an annual
23 percent -- the sharpest decline in seven years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Israel will defend its people at all costs: Israeli representative</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  30 (CNA)
12/30/08  21:17:03
(By Luis Yu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Raphael Gamzou, the head of the Israel Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei
(ISECO) , said at a press conference Friday that Israel is prepared to defend
its people at all costs in response to the rocket attacks launched by the ruling
Islamic militant group Hamas in the Gaza Strip.</P>
      <P>Gamzou, Israel's top representative to Taiwan, said it is important that the
Taiwanese people understand Israel's struggle, as no one is inmune from
extremist terrorism.</P>
      <P>"The recent Mumbai attacks on foreign citizens by terrorist organizations is an
example of what the Israeli people have endured in the past seven years," said
Gamzou.</P>
      <P>According to the Israeli representative, intense levels of rocket fire against
the Israeli city of Sderot and the area of the Western Negev began in January
2001, and continue to this very day.</P>
      <P>As of January 2008, over 8,000 rockets had been launched by terrorists in Gaza
at Sderot and Western Negev, causing significant damage to homes and property,
while injuring 583 Israeli residents and traumatizing thousands of adults and
children, according to Gamzou.</P>
      <P>Approximately 2.5 kilometers outside of Western Negev, Sderot is on the
receiving end of a large number of rocket attacks from Gaza, said Gamzou.</P>
      <P>Describing the suffering of the residents in the area over the past seven years,
Gamzou said that of the 28 deaths from terrorist rocket fire in Western Negev
since 2001, nine victims were Sderot residents, three of whom were children.
Thousands of Sderot residents have relocated from the city out of fear for their
lives and their children's lives, he added.</P>
      <P>"Whoever heard Hamas's statements understood that they decided to increase the
attacks on the residents of Israel by firing rockets and mortars
indiscriminately," said Gamzou, adding that Israel had no alternative but to
respond.</P>
      <P>Gamzou stressed that while Israel does not rejoice in battle, it will not be
deterred from it.</P>
      <P>Quoting a passage from the Bible -- "Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth" --
Gamzou said that many of the terrorists are children who have been brainwashed
and manipulated by cruel and cynical leaders.</P>
      <P>According to ISECO, for approximately seven years, hundreds of thousands of
Israeli citizens living in the southern cities of the country, adjacent to the
Gaza Strip, have been suffering as a result of missiles being fired at them by
Hamas terrorists.</P>
      <P>"I urge the Taiwanese people not to be fooled by the cheap terrorist propaganda
of a humanitarian disaster in the area, as we will see to the needs of the
population in Gaza and will do our best to prevent a humanitarian crisis that
will impinge upon residents' lives," said Gamzou.</P>
      <P>Being in the front line of the war against terrorism and the only democratic
free society in the Middle East, Israel needs the support of the international
community in its struggle to achieve peace and coexistence with the Palestinian
people in the area, Gamzou said.</P>
      <P>Israel is not at war with the Arab world -- the Islamic, the Muslim or the
Palestinian people -- as its main targets are Iranian-funded extremist
organizations such as the Hamas terrorist organizations and the Islamic Jihad,
he said.</P>
      <P>The current Israeli military operation in the Gaza strip is designed, first and
foremost, to bring about an improvement in the security reality for the
residents of the southern part of Israel, he added.</P>
      <P>"We did everything in our power to fulfill the conditions of the calm in the
south and enable normal life for citizens in the communities adjacent to the
Gaza Strip, but the peace and quiet we offered was returned by Hamas' shelling,"
said Gamzou.</P>
      <P>Asked about Palestinian civilian casualties in the conflict, Gamzou said the
Israeli forces are focusing only on military and terrorist targets, but its hard
to avoid some "collateral damage", especially when the Hamas militants use their
own citizens as human shields.</P>

      <P>The two eastern counties of Hualien and Taitung are presenting a flower blossom
season lasting two months until Feb. 20 and featuring 7,500 hectares of flower
fields in the rift valley along Taiwan's east coast.</P>
      <P>The leisure farming program aimed at boosting tourism in eastern Taiwan is a
joint effort by the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications, the Agriculture and Food Agency under the Cabinet-level Council
of Agriculture, the Hualien county government, the Taitung county government,
and 13 regional farmers' Associations.</P>
      <P>More than 7,000 hectares of fallow farmland along Provincial Highway No. 9 are
covered with yellow rape flowers, while 385 hectares are being used to grow
sunflowers and Cosmos bipinnatus, commonly known as the Mexican aster,
presenting stunning, colorful fields of blooms in the rift valley between
Shoufong township in Hualien County and Luye township in Taitung County -- also
known as the "green corridor."</P>
      <P>According to Tourism Bureau Director-General Janice Lai, by combining leisure
farming and tourism, many areas of the country have found a new driving force to
rejuvenate flagging tourism in their areas.</P>
      <P>At present, in the city of Hualien and in Fuli township in Hualien County, as
well as in Luye and Guanshan townships in Taitung County, the flower fields are
in full bloom.</P>
      <P>Experts said that in January, visitors will be able to see even more beautiful
blooming fields in Rueisuei and Yusi townships in Hualien County, as well as in
Chihshang township in Taitung County.</P>
      <P>During the two-month blooming season, more than 300 hotels, restaurants and hot
spring resorts in eastern Taiwan will offer discounts to visitors and various

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Social Welfare (DSW) under the Taipei city government said
Tuesday that the economic downturn has led to more people becoming homeless,
many of whom are younger people, which requires a change in the nature of the
department's work and an increased budget.</P>
      <P>According to Chung Pei-chen, a section chief of the Division of Social Work
under the DSW, there are more vagrants in the capital than there were three
years ago, with the average age having dropped.</P>
      <P>She noted that there were around 300 homeless people in Taipei City three years
ago, most of whom were aged between 50 and 60.</P>
      <P>The number has increased to 500, she went on, adding that the number of homeless
people in their 40s still capable of working has increased.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, the task of our division has turned from lodging homeless people to
encouraging them to earn their own livings and helping them find employment, "
Chung told CNA, adding that the task is not easy, especially with the high
unemployment rate.</P>
      <P>The Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics reported that
Taiwan's unemployment rate had soared to 4.64 percent as of November,
representing 507,000 jobless people.</P>
      <P>As the number of homeless people increases, the problem of a lack of social
workers and budget has emerged, said Chung.</P>
      <P>She added that the only two reception centers for homeless people in Taipei have
only 113 beds and that her agency is trying to map out plans to help lodge other
homeless people, which might require several million dollars, while last year,
her section had only NT$700,000 to spend on issues related to the homeless.</P>
      <P>"Building another reception center is almost impossible because of pressure from
the public," she said.</P>
      <P>Chung said her unit began regular visits to homeless people in Taipei City this

      <P>Taiwan is trying to have the traditional Chinese character set used in Taiwan
listed as a world heritage item, and an Executive Yuan official in charge of the
mission said Tuesday that the goal might be achieved soon if China agrees to
help.</P>
      <P>Minister without Portfolio Ovid J.L. Tzeng made the remarks in response to media
inquiries after a year-end Executive Yuan press conference held that day.</P>
      <P>Describing traditional Chinese as an important cultural asset of mankind, Tzeng

      <P>According to Tzeng, people from other cultures "might be amazed that Taiwanese
people in the modern era can communicate with ancient people living 2000 years

      <P>While the government is outlining plans for the application submission, it
believes that if China can help, it would resolve some tough challenges, such as
Taiwan's not being part of the United Nations, Tzeng said.</P>
      <P>Tzeng said China will not be opposed to the idea of letting traditional Chinese
become a key cultural asset of mankind, since the simplified Chinese form
devised by the communist regime was developed from traditional Chinese.</P>

      <P>More than 100 workers at the Grand Hotel in Kaohsiung who were slated to be laid
off before the Lunar New Year reached an agreement with the hotel management
Tuesday that resulted in a retraction of the decision.</P>
      <P>The Grand Hotel in Kaohsiung had earlier decided to lay off 108 staff members of
its club before Jan. 26 next year, but the workers staged a series of protests,
expressing worries about losing their jobs at a time when the country is being
squeezed by the economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Representatives of the workers and the hotel management held a meeting at the
legislative Yuan Tuesday, with Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng serving as
moderator.</P>
      <P>The hotel management finally agreed to retract its decision to lay off the club
staff, while the workers decided to withdraw their request for intermediation in
the matter.</P>
      <P>The hotel management agreed that the 108 workers of the club will be moved to
the Grand Hotel in Kaohsiung Jan. 1, but stipulated that they would have to
accept a pay cut of 10 percent starting March 1, 2009, although their years of
service will still be counted.</P>
      <P>The management also promised that when the hotel starts showing a profit again,
the workers' pay will be restored to the original level.</P>
      <P>The hotel management said it will also provide the necessary training and advice
for the workers to make the transition to the hotel staff.</P>
      <P>Chang Shuo-luo, chairman of the Grand Hotel in Taipei and Kaohsiung, said the
management fully explained the difficulties the hotel club is facing, with its
losses amounting to NT$5 million per month. The workers also stated their case,
mentioning their fears about making a living if they are laid off, he said.</P>
      <P>"Both sides love the Grand Hotel, but have expressed their feelings in different

      <P>Evergreen Group Chairman Chang Jung-fa said Tuesday that the group will not lay
off workers or force them to take unpaid leave as they are "valuable assets" of
the group's companies.</P>
      <P>In an informal meeting with the media, Chang also described the economic
downturn as similar to the Great Depression of the 1930s, saying that the days
ahead will be "harsh."</P>
      <P>"The world economy will probably only improve in 2012, " he predicted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lee Ching-an announced her decision Tuesday
to withdraw from the party over a controversy surrounding her citizenship.</P>
      <P>Lee, who voluntarily suspended her legislator status on Dec. 25 over the dual
citizenship dispute, said in a statement that although U.S. authorities have yet
to release the "final outcome" of their investigation into her U.S. citizenship
status, she has decided to quit the KMT lest the issue tarnish the party's
reputation.</P>
      <P>Lee's eligibility as a legislator has been challenged since it was reported
early this year that she never officially renounced her U.S. citizenship even
though she had been in public office in Taiwan since 1994.</P>
      <P>The Nationality Act forbids Republic of China nationals who hold foreign
citizenship  from assuming  public office and requires officials holding foreign
citizenship to be removed from their posts.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has been urging the KMT, which
holds more than a two-thirds majority in the legislature, not to continue to
cover up what it called Lee's violation of the nationality regulations.</P>
      <P>As Lee can only be stripped of her legislative seat in this case by a majority
vote in the lawmaking body, she opted to voluntarily surrender her KMT
membership to safeguard the reputation of her party.</P>
      <P>Upon learning of Lee's renunciation of her party membership, Juan Kang-meng,
head of the KMT's Evaluation and Discipline Committee, said the committee will
meet Wednesday as originally scheduled, but the agenda will focus on general
party issues instead of a review of Lee's case.</P>
      <P>Ruan said he believes Lee made the decision to quit the party mainly because she
does not want to see the party's reputation damaged as result of the controversy
over the dual citizenship issue.</P>
      <P>Lee admitted that she obtained U.S. citizenship in 1991, but argued that she
"legally" lost her status as a U.S. citizen when she was sworn in as a Taipei
city councilor in 1994, citing U.S. law which lists serving in a foreign
government as one of the legal conditions for the loss of citizenship.</P>
      <P>Under pressure from the DPP, the Legislative Yuan requested the MOFA in May to
help verify with foreign governments whether any of the sitting legislators were
holding dual citizenship.</P>
      <P>The MOFA received a reply from the U.S. in early December and the letter was
distributed as a classified document to all legislators Dec. 24.</P>
      <P>While saying there is no record of loss of U.S. citizenship by Lee, the letter
also states that "U.S. citizens who hold the citizenship of a foreign country
and who accept employment with the government of that country that requires an
oath, affirmation or declaration of allegiance may have committed an
expatriating act if they do so with the intent to relinquish their U.S.
citizenship."</P>
      <P>"While the Department (of State) has not made any determination regarding loss
of citizenship for the individual named above, it could do so based on evidence
that he or she committed a potentially expatriating  act  with  the intention
of relinquishing  U.S. citizenship. Any such determination would be retroactive
to the date of the expatriating act," the letter reads.</P>
      <P>On Dec.25, Lee claimed that a report on her U.S. citizenship status delivered
recently by the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) to the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs on her case was "not final" and urged the public to wait for the final
result before censuring her.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Social Welfare (DSW) under the Taipei city government said
Tuesday that the economic downturn has led to more people becoming homeless,
many of whom are younger people, which requires a change in the nature of the
department's work and an increased budget.</P>
      <P>According to Chung Pei-chen, a section chief of the Division of Social Work
under the DSW, there are more vagrants in the capital than there were three
years ago, with the average age having dropped.</P>
      <P>She noted that there were around 300 homeless people in Taipei City three years
ago, most of whom were aged between 50 and 60.</P>
      <P>The number has increased to 500, she went on, adding that the number of homeless
people in their 40s still capable of working has increased.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, the task of our division has turned from lodging homeless people to
encouraging them to earn their own livings and helping them find employment, "
Chung told CNA, adding that the task is not easy, especially with the high
unemployment rate.</P>
      <P>The Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics reported that
Taiwan's unemployment rate had soared to 4.64 percent as of November,
representing 507,000 jobless people.</P>
      <P>As the number of homeless people increases, the problem of a lack of social
workers and budget has emerged, said Chung.</P>
      <P>She added that the only two reception centers for homeless people in Taipei have
only 113 beds and that her agency is trying to map out plans to help lodge other
homeless people, which might require several million dollars, while last year,
her section had only NT$700,000 to spend on issues related to the homeless.</P>
      <P>"Building another reception center is almost impossible because of pressure from
the public," she said.</P>
      <P>Chung said her unit began regular visits to homeless people in Taipei City this
year in mid-November when temperatures began to drop.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou expressed concern Tuesday over a sharp increase in the
number of bicycle thefts around Taiwan and called on the National Police Agency
to work out measures to curb this kind of crime.</P>
      <P>Statistics released by the Criminal Investigation Bureau show that in the first
11 months of 2008, a total of 2,958 bicycles were reported stolen around Taiwan,
a whopping rise of 61.46 percent over the 1,832 thefts reported in the same
period of 2007.</P>
      <P>The figurers also show that police were able to crack 51 percent of the thefts,
compared with 44 percent for the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>Bureau executives said they had noticed the sharp rise in the number of bike
thefts well before  the president  issued the instruction that the prevention of
bicycle thefts should be a police priority for 2009.</P>
      <P>They said police offices around Taiwan had already begun to imprint serial
numbers on the bike frames free of charge as one of a series of measures to curb
theft.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has recently forged a cooperative agreement with the United States on

Taiwanese citizens to the United States, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>An exchange of notes concerning the initiative was completed Dec. 19 in
Washington  D.C.  by the Taipei Economic  and Cultural Representative Office in
the United States and the American Institute in Taiwan, the MOFA said in a
statement.</P>
      <P>According to the Principles for Cooperation on Improving Travel Security
established between the two countries, they will work together  to crack down on
forged  documents,  share traveler information,  promote the issuance of
e-Passports and exchange information on terrorists, the MOFA said.</P>
      <P>The two sides will also improve the method for exchanging information on lost or
stolen passports, continue cooperation on an airborne police project and enhance
cooperation on airport security, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>These principles are requirements that Taiwan must meet before further
negotiating with Washington for visa-free entry to the United States by
Taiwanese citizens, the ministry added.</P>
      <P>To facilitate the cooperation, the two sides will first set up a working group

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will continue to push for the establishment of cross-Taiwan
Strait mediation and arbitration panels to help iron out business and trade
disputes, Taiwan's top China policy coordinator said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said that while commerce
with China has grown and Taiwanese investment in China has risen steadily, the
rights of local businesspeople have not been protected when disputes arose.</P>
      <P>Addressing a general meeting of the Arbitration Association of the Republic of
China, Lai said that setting up trade mediation and arbitration organizations
across the Taiwan Strait will be one of the key issues on the agenda of the
next, or third, round of dialogue between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>The negotiations will be spearheaded by Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of Taiwan's
quasi-official  intermediary  body Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , and his
Chinese counterpart -- Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Other key issues expected to be tackled during the next SEF-ARATS meeting
include joint cross-strait efforts to combat crime, food safety, a cross-strait
financial supervisory mechanism, investment and intellectual  property
protection,  double  taxation,  and cooperation on standards, metrology and
certification, Lai added.</P>
      <P>Chen made a historic visit to Taiwan in November for the previous round of
dialogue between the two quasi-official bodies.</P>
      <P>During that visit, Chiang and Chen inked four cooperation pacts, which primarily
expanded the scope of nonstop charter flights between Taiwan and China and
launched direct shipping and postal links.</P>
      <P>The two negotiators first held landmark talks in Beijing in June this year,
reaching agreements on opening Taiwan wider to Chinese tourists and on launching
nonstop weekend charter flights between the two sides.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has invested major efforts in improving relations with
Beijing since taking office in May, openly stating that he will not pursue
unification or independence during his term in favor of pursuing a policy
focusing on strengthening economic ties to help revive Taiwan's sluggish
economy.</P>

      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) signed a pact Tuesday with 15
mobile device vendors and telecommunication operators to collect and recycle
unwanted mobile phones, PDAs, GPS systems and battery chargers.</P>
      <P>Under the program, which begins Jan. 15, 2009, the mobile phone operators will
collect unwanted devices in recycling bins at their 2,000 retail outlets, and
the devices will then be turned over to qualified companies for recycling.</P>
      <P>According to National Communications Commission figures, every person in Taiwan
was averaging 1.08 cell phone subscriptions as of the end of November. With the
use of mobile phones so widespread, recycling unwanted devices is of critical
importance, the EPA indicated.</P>
      <P>The agency estimates that about 9.5 million cell phones were retired last year.
Of those, 44 percent were left idle at home, 36 percent were sold secondhand or
given away, while only 18 percent were recycled.</P>
      <P>EPA Minister Shen Shu-hung said 1 kilogram of gold can be retrieved from 30,000
discarded mobile phones, while a kilo of silver can be extracted from some
10,000 discarded phones, citing estimates by the Japanese Telecommunications
Carriers Association.</P>
      <P>Moreover, recycling 10,000 old cell phones can save up 220,000 kilowatt hours of
electricity, which could power 57 families for a year. The savings translate
into a reduction of 140 metric tons of carbon emissions, according to Shen.</P>
      <P>The EPA minister called on the public to bring unwanted mobile communication
devices and accessories to any of the retail stores or hand them to companies
for recycling.</P>
      <P>The 15 mobile service carriers and vendors include Chunghwa Telecom, Taiwan
Mobile, Asia Pacific Telecom, Vibo Telecom, FETnet, First International Telecom,
Aurora, Sony Ericsson,  Nokia and Motorola.</P>

      <P>New Government Information Office (GIO) Minister Su Jun-pin said at his
swearing-in Wednesday that he has not taken the job simply to "speak" or
"debate."</P>

Tzeng.</P>
      <P>Describing his mentality in taking the job as "treading on thin ice, " the new
GIO chief said that in the face of the global economic downturn, "you dare not
say 'no' to this job if you have any compassion toward this land."</P>
      <P>"I will face a lot of pressure, but I hope to persevere in spite of
difficulties," he said.</P>
      <P>Su admitted that he has not had much time to prepare himself, but stressed he
would strive to let Taiwan's people know how hard the government is trying to
lead the country through the mist of the global economic turmoil.</P>
      <P>Lauding Su as an "unusually talented" young man, Tzeng said Su will be an
effective spokesman in describing the government's policies given his excellent
communication skills.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on Tuesday called for a cease-fire
between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and urged the two sides to settle
the dispute through negotations.</P>
      <P>Although the ministry maintained a cautionary yellow-level travel alert for the
Gaza Strip and the parts of Israel in its vicinity, it advised Taiwanese
nationals to avoid traveling to the affected areas for the time being.</P>
      <P>In addition, the MOFA urged Taiwanese nationals bound for or already in the area
to exercise caution and invited them to call the emergency assistance line (at
0544-275-204)  at the ministry's representative office in Israel, if they ran
into trouble.</P>
      <P>The ministry had not received any reports of Taiwanese casualties or property
losses as of Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The MOFA has a three-tiered travel warning. Yellow advises travelers to be
cautious, orange suggests trips to be postponed, and red advises against
traveling to the trouble spot altogether.</P>
      <P>Israel has pounded the Gaza Strip with air strikes since Saturday, less than a
week after the expiry of a six-month-long cease-fire deal with Hamas, in
response to rocket attacks launched by the Islamic group that began the same
day.</P>
      <P>Israeli military officials have said they intend to break either Hamas's
capacity or its will to fire rockets into Israeli territory.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT accepts legislator's offer to quit party over citizenship issue</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  31 (CNA)
12/31/08  15:56:33

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) accepted Wednesday an offer by Legislator  Lee
Ching-an to voluntarily relinquish her party membership over a controversy
surrounding her alleged dual citizenship.</P>
      <P>Juan Kang-meng, head of the KMT's Party Disciplinary Committee, said after a
committee meeting that Lee's offer was approved unanimously by the committee in
light of the negative impact of Lee's case on the party's image.</P>
      <P>According to Juan, Lee presented a number of documents to the committee in
support of her claim that she no longer holds U.S. citizenship, and the
committee did not take a stance on whether or not to believe her.</P>
      <P>"Every committee member had his or her own opinion on the issue, but the
committee eventually concurred that Lee should be allowed to withdraw from the
party so as not to damage the party's image, " Juan explained.</P>
      <P>Lee announced her decision to give up her KMT membership voluntarily just one
day before the committee was scheduled to meet to discuss what measures to take
to deal with her case. The KMT reportedly would have expelled her had she not
taken the initiative to disassociate herself from the party.</P>
      <P>Lee's withdrawal from the KMT came one week after she voluntarily suspended her
legislative duties, following the recent delivery of a U.S. report to Taiwan
that confirms Lee "has previously been documented as a U.S. citizen with a U.S.
passport and that no subsequent loss of U.S. citizenship has been documented."</P>
      <P>Also Wednesday, the KMT legislative caucus said it was correct for Lee to quit
the party voluntarily before the party took action against her.</P>
      <P>Lu Hsueh-chang, a deputy whip of the caucus, said the issue has persisted this
long because Lee has not tried to handle it properly over the past nine months,
which he said indicates a need for Lee to strengthen her damage control
capability.</P>
      <P>Lee's qualification as a legislator has been challenged since March this year
when it was reported that she has never officially renounced her U.S.
citizenship even though she has held public office in Taiwan since 1994.</P>
      <P>Dual citizenship is strictly forbidden for public office-holders in Taiwan. The
Nationality Act requires those with dual nationality renounce their foreign
citizenship before assuming public office and to obtain a certificate testifying
to the loss of citizenship within one year of their inauguration.</P>
      <P>The law also requires those with foreign citizenship to be removed from their
posts.</P>
      <P>Lee admitted that she obtained U.S. citizenship in 1991, but argued that she
lost her status as a U.S. citizen "legally" when she was sworn in as a Taipei
city councilor in 1994, citing U.S. law which lists serving in a foreign
government as one of the legal conditions for the loss of nationality.</P>
      <P>Under pressure from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , the Legislative
Yuan requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) in May to help verify with
foreign governments whether any incumbent legislators hold foreign citizenship.</P>
      <P>A reply by the U.S. State Department was received by the ministry in early
December, and the letter was submitted to the Legislative Yuan Dec. 22.</P>
      <P>While saying there was no record that Lee lost her U.S. citizenship, the State
Department also noted that U.S. citizens serving in a foreign government "may
have committed an expatriating act if they do so with the intent to relinquish
their U.S. nationality."</P>
      <P>Lee has argued that the U.S.  reply means that her U.S. citizenship  status is
still up in the air pending  a final determination by the U.S. government.</P>
      <P>Despite  the DPP's call for the Legislative  Yuan to act immediately to strip
Lee of her legislative post, the legislative body is not planning to take any
action before Jan. 31, 2009, the deadline the legislature has given to Lee to
prove her loss of U.S. citizenship.</P>
      <P>Lee was first elected to the Legislative Yuan in late 1998 and is currently
serving her fourth term in the lawmaking body.</P>

      <P>More than 10,000 people are expected to take part in a calligraphy event on New
Year's Day in Taipei to set a record for submission to the Guinness Book of
World Records, the city's Cultural Affairs Department said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will be one of 16 officials who will kick off the event,
which is scheduled to take place at the Huashan Cultural-Creative Park from 1
p.m. Thursday.</P>
      <P>Ma and the 15 other officials will write 16 propitious words with writing
brushes and ink, department officials said.</P>
      <P>The ceremony will be followed by a mass calligraphy event in which more than
10,000 people are expected to take part, the officials added.</P>
      <P>The department is hoping to have the event included in the Guinness Book of
World Records, as there is no record for large numbers of people performing
calligraphy simultaneously at a single location.</P>
      <P>The sponsors of the event will also provide blank red paper so that members of
the public can write their own Spring Festival couplets, a traditional activity
to herald the Chinese New Year, which falls on Jan. 26.</P>
      <P>A calligraphy  exhibition  of works by a number of noted calligraphers will also
be staged at the park Jan. 1-12, according to the Cultural Affairs Department.</P>
      <P>The activities are part of the 2009 Chinese Character Festival that was started

      <P>Health insurance premiums for children and adolescents  under 18 from low-income
families will be fully subsidized by the government starting Jan. 1, 2009,
Minister of the Interior Liao Liou-yi announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) has allocated NT$100 million (US$3.05
million) in its 2009 budget to serve that end in the initial stage, and some
110,000 underprivileged children and teenagers are expected to be covered under
the program, Liao said. The program has been expanded from coverage of children
under three years old from poor families.</P>
      <P>The newly modified measure is aimed at guaranteeing proper medical care for such
children and teenagers and helping to ease the financial burden on their
families at a time when the country is in economic straits, Liao said.</P>
      <P>Liao made the announcement at a news conference at the MOI. Premier Liu Chao-
shiuan, who was also present, said the government is prepared to take better
care of the poor despite the challenges resulting from the global financial
crisis.</P>
      <P>The premier said he has asked Liao to call an inter-ministerial meeting after
the Lunar New Year in late January to discuss the establishment of a social
security network that would involve a comprehensive upgrade of social security
and welfare mechanisms, as more and more people are losing their jobs due to the

    <TEXT>
      <P>A new monthly payment-based labor insurance pension system will go into effect
Jan. 1, setting a milestone in protection of local retired workers' rights, the
Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>At a ceremony to mark the new system's inauguration, President Ma Ying-jeou said
that along with the labor insurance pension system, the national health
insurance, the national pension system newly put into effect and other forms of
social insurance, Taiwan's social security system is approaching international
standards.</P>
      <P>He further noted that to guarantee laborers' rights, a plan is being studied to
set up a workers' fund to help them file lawsuits should they be illegally laid
off.</P>
      <P>"The monthly payment-based labor insurance pension is the most important reform
of the labor insurance system; it permits retired workers to receive benefits
every month. The longer they live, the more payments they will receive, " said
CLA Minister Wang Ju-hsuan, who added that around 2 million retired workers will
benefit from the new system as soon as it goes into operation.</P>
      <P>The approval of the new system is considered Wang's first major achievement
since Ma's administration took office in May.</P>
      <P>The inauguration ceremony was also attended by Premier Liu Chao-shiuan and
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, as well as legislators who approved the
system.</P>
      <P>The labor insurance pension system, mapped out over 15 years and designed to
better guarantee the welfare of 8.8 million retired workers, was passed after a
final reading by the Legislative Yuan in July.</P>
      <P>The new system's premium rate begins at 7.5 percent, increasing year by year to
13 percent, with an income substitution factor of 1.55 percent.</P>
      <P>Prior to the implementation of the new system, retirees received their pensions
in a single lump sum, the value of which risked being eroded by inflation and
poor investment.</P>
      <P>The new system will permit retired workers from the age of 60 to choose to
collect their pension in either a single lump sum or to receive it in monthly
instalments until death.</P>
      <P>If they choose to receive monthly payments, the amount they will be able to
receive after eight years, in average, will outstrip the total amount if they
receive the lump sum, according to the CLA.</P>
      <P>In addition, survivors or designated beneficiaries of a deceased worker who dies
before reaching pensionable age can apply to receive a lump sum or monthly
payment from the deceased worker's pension account.</P>
      <P>If the insured worker is assessed after an accident as being unable to work for
the rest of his or her life, he or she can also apply for either a lump-sum
pension or monthly payments.</P>
      <P>Retired workers opting for the monthly payments will receive an amount equalling
the number of years they have participated in the labor insurance system times
their average monthly wage times the income substitution factor.</P>

      <P>A total of 123 individuals were found guilty as the Taipei District Court
concluded Wednesday its trial of a high-profile embezzlement case involving the
Rebar Asia Pacific Group.</P>
      <P>The defendants included seven children of group founder Wang You-theng, who were
found to have collaborated with their father to loot funds from various
subsidiaries under the business conglomerate.</P>
      <P>The major irregularities identified in the court's 4,000-page verdict included
the hollowing out of Chia Hsin Food &amp; Synthetic Fiber Co., Great Chinese
Bills Finance Corp. and Asia Pacific Broadband Telecom Co. (APBT) ; illegal
lending by the Chinese Banks and Union Insurance Co.; and a fake transaction
between the Eastern Multimedia Group and APBT. The total amount of funds
siphoned off from the group was estimated at more than NT$42.78 billion (US$1.3
billion).</P>
      <P>The financial irregularities in the Rebar empire came to light after Wang You-
theng and his third wife, Wang Chin She-ying, fled to China in December 2006,
soon after the Rebar Group applied for bankruptcy protection.</P>
      <P>The couple later flew to the United States in January 2007 and was placed by
Taiwanese authorities on the country's most-wanted list Jan. 15, 2007, a listing
that will remain in effect through May 2031.</P>
      <P>The verdict issued by the Taipei District Court Wednesday did not include a
sentence for Wang You-theng, who was indicted in March 2007 on a long list of
charges, including fraud, money laundering and insider trading.</P>
      <P>Among Wang You-theng's children who were found guilty, former Eastern Multimedia
Group President Gary Wang was sentenced to 18 years in jail and fined NT$700
million on 29 counts. His illicit gains totaling more than NT$300 million should
also be confiscated, the verdict stated.</P>
      <P>Former Rebar Group Chairwoman Wang Ling-mei got 18 years and an NT$150 million
fine on 10 counts; former APBT Acting Chairman Wang Ling-tai got 20 years and an
NT$700 million fine on eight counts; and former Chia Hsin Food &amp; Synthetic
Fiber Co. President Wang Ling-yi got 20 years and an NT$1 billion fine on 132
counts.</P>
      <P>Chinese Bank Vice President Wang Ling-chiao was sentenced to 13 years and fined
NT$300 million on nine counts; Wang Ling-ke, another Chinese Bank vice
president, was sentenced to 10 years and fined NT$100 million; and Yi Feng Asset
Management Co. Chairman Lawrence Wang was sentenced to three years and six
months.</P>
      <P>Other members of the Wang family who were convicted were Wang You-theng's
younger brother, former Union Insurance Co. President Frank Wang, who got 16
years and an NT$400 million on 11 counts; and Wang You-theng's second wife, Chen
Pei-fang, the head of several Rebar subsidiaries, who got 15 years and an NT$210
million fine on 13 counts.</P>
      <P>Also Wednesday, the district referred 71 others for prosecution for their
alleged involvement in the Rebar scandal. They included former Finance Ministers
Lin Chuan and Lee Yung-san as well as former Financial Supervisory Commission
Vice Chairwoman Susan Chang.</P>

development of a three-in-one poultry vaccine.</P>
      <P>The National Science Council (NSC) on Wednesday announced the breakthrough in
its agricultural biotech development project.</P>
      <P>Professor Lee Lung-hu at National Chung Hsing University's Department of
Veterinary Medicine, who heads the research team, predicted that combination
vaccines for poultry would become the trend, as too many different kinds of
vaccines can adversely affect the health of fowl.</P>
      <P>Diseases like avian influenza, fowlpox, Newcastle disease and infectious bursal
disease can all seriously hurt poultry farm business, he said. If success could
be achieved in the efforts to develop and mass produce the three-in-one vaccine
against fowlpox, Newcastle disease and infectious bursal disease, it would help
chicken farmers to save costs, he added.</P>
      <P>In Lee's research, which employed gene engineering techniques, he used the
fowlpox virus as a vector to develop a vaccine against bursal disease. The next
step will be to test the vaccine at chicken farms, he said.</P>

      <P>Job loss stress and anxiety seem to be causing an increasing number of people in
Taiwan to lose their hair, with a higher incidence of the condition occurring
among females, medical doctors in northern Taiwan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Li Cheng-hung, a dermatologist at the Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital in
Taipei, told reporters that among his patients, more women than men are
suffering from alopecia areata, a skin disorder that causes the hair to fall out
in round or oval patches.</P>
      <P>Citing a typical case, Li said a 20-year-old female worker at an information
technology  company had developed bald spots from constantly worrying that she
might lose her job because her boss might not be happy with her work
performance.</P>
      <P>Li said it took over six months of treatment, using a combination of methods,
for the woman's hair to grow back.</P>
      <P>He added that physical and psychological stress can disrupt a person's immune
system and destroy the hair follicles, resulting in hair loss.</P>
      <P>The skin doctor advised people with such problems to consult a hospital
dermatologist instead of seeking unconventional treatment.</P>
      <P>He said a dermatologist will usually assess a patient's condition before giving
localized treatment, prescribing medicines or using the pulse  therapy  --  a
short,  intensive  administration  of pharmacotherapy.</P>
      <P>At Chang Gung Memorial Hospital's Linkou branch in northern Taiwan, another skin
doctor, Huang Yao-li, confirmed that the number of hair loss patients is on the
rise, probably because of the growing stress of everyday life.</P>
      <P>"The skin and the hair are like a mirror that can reflect the degree of stress a
person is experiencing," he said, adding that in addition to seeking medical
treatment, patients need to learn how to cope with stress.</P>
      <P>Although emotional stress is believed to be a contributing factor to alopecia
areata, it is not fully known what is the primary cause of the condition.</P>
      <P>Some researchers believe that genetic factors play an important role, since
there is a higher incidence of alopecia areata among people who have a family
history of the disorder.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chinese touristsarrivals wont cause hepatitis A epidemic: CDC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 31 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said Wednesday that hepatitis A is
unlikely to break out in Taiwan as public health conditions here are good,
rebutting a local newspaper s warning that an expected increase in Chinese
tourists due to expanded direct flights will cause an outbreak of the liver
disease.</P>
      <P>The Liberty Times warned in its Wednesday issue that a hepatitis A epidemic may
break out in Taiwan as a result of direct flights between the island and China
being expanded to daily flights and direct shipping links being launched earlier
this month for the first time since the two sides split at the end of a civil
war in 1949.</P>
      <P>But the CDC under the Department of Health rebutted the argument.</P>
      <P>"Hepatitis  A infection is highly related to environmental hygiene,... Taiwan's
basic public health conditions have been largely improved compared to 20 years
ago. It is unlikely that (the disease) will break out here," said Lin Ting, CDC
deputy director-general.</P>
      <P>Lin said that even if Chinese tourists with hepatitis A come to Taiwan and
spread the virus, there would be only a few individual cases, not an epidemic.</P>
      <P>But he noted that most young Taiwanese people under age 30 do not have the
antibody to hepatitis A. If these people make frequent visits to Southeast Asia
and mainland China and stay there for a long period of time, they must be
careful about eating local food and environmental hygiene, to prevent from
getting hepatitis A.</P>
      <P>Getting a vaccination is the most efficient way to avoid contracting the
infectious disease, Lin said, encouraging people to be vaccinated.</P>
      <P>The CDC, in collaboration with health bureaus of Keelung City and Taipei City in
northern Taiwan and Kaohsiung City in southern Taiwan, recently implemented a
hepatitis A vaccination program on people working in the food and beverage
businesses in night markets, in order to reduce the hepatitis A infection rate
and protect consumers' safety.</P>
      <P>Night market workers who are immune to hepatitis A or have received a
vaccination will be given a certificate, according to the CDC.</P>
      <P>A CDC investigation has found that 69.5 percent of 1,290 workers in food and
drink businesses in night markets had an antibody to hepatitis A, and the rest
of the workers were inoculated by the CDC.</P>
      <P>The hepatitis A virus enters the body mostly through the mouth or contact with
feces. The disease is found mainly in regions where pubic health conditions are
poor. Symptoms of hepatitis A include fever, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite,
abdominal pain and fatigue.</P>

      <P>A total of 1,651 cartons of contraband foreign cigarettes with a market value of
over NT$20 million (US$610,000) were nabbed by police Wednesday off the port of
Budai in southern Taiwan's Chiayi County, according to Kaohsiung Harbor police.</P>
      <P>Eleven crewmen, including five foreign nationals -- one from Myanmar and four
from Indonesia -- were detained along with the contraband that had been
transferred at sea off the coast of eastern Taiwan's Hualien County from a
fishing boat to a gravel vessel based out of Kaohsiung County, the police said.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Port police officers and their colleagues at Budai found the smuggled
cigarettes concealed in the bottom deck of the gravel ship in a pre-dawn raid
while the contraband goods were being unloaded from the vessel to a waiting
truck, police said.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that a gravel vessel had been caught smuggling contraband
into Taiwan, police said, adding that the crewmen were trying to cover the

    <HEADLINE>MOFA to beef up efforts to strengthen relations with non-allies</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Wednesday that it will beef up
efforts under the current modus vivendi diplomatic approach to strengthen
relations with countries with which Taiwan does not have diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco H. L. Ou said at a press conference  that
the modus vivendi approach that President Ma Ying-jeou has adopted since his
inauguration in May has benefited Taiwan and "indeed resulted in many positive
developments."</P>
      <P>For instance, the minister said, the ministry is expected to establish
representative offices next year in the Japanese city of Sapporo and in Turkey's
largest city, Istanbul, which would help facilitate mutual exchanges between
Taiwan and the two countries and provide Taiwan citizens in those cities with
better services.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also reached agreements with Canada and Japan in June and October,
respectively, on reciprocal recognition of drivers' licenses, Ou added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ministry would seek advice and assistance from the semi-official
Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) and from private business
groups on ways to enhance commercial links with Southeast Asian countries, which
are traditionally important trading partners with Taiwan, according to the
minister.</P>
      <P>He admitted, however, that "there are still a lot of obstacles to clear" if
Taiwan is to set up representative offices in some regional countries such as
Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia.</P>
      <P>Therefore,  the ministry will discuss with the TAITRA the possibility of first
establishing TAITRA trade centers in those countries, Ou said.</P>
      <P>In addition, in view of Taiwan's promise to make its foreign aid programs
transparent,  Australia and New Zealand have recently expressed interest in
cooperating on the programs to be implemented by Taiwan in the South Pacific
island states with which it has diplomatic ties, Ou said.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Ou disclosed that President Ma might attend summits or embark on
state visits next year to secure closer diplomatic ties with Taiwan's allies in
the South Pacific and Central and South America.</P>
      <P>As Ma's first state visit to Taiwan's Central and South American allies in
August proved successful, Ou said, the ministry will work toward making similar
arrangements and has suggested several events that Ma could attend,  such as the
presidential  inauguration ceremonies in Panama and El Salvador slated for
mid-2009.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's in-line speed skating athletes should be able to capture at least four
gold medals at the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou in China's Guangdong province,
the head coach of the Taiwanese roller skating team said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Huang Chin-lung told a news conference that the Taiwanese team, known officially
by the name Chinese Taipei, is currently training at a "secret base" in Kunming
in China's Yunnan province, because training at the 1,200-meter altitude is good
preparation for the athletes.</P>
      <P>Chiang Pin-cheng, chairman of the the Chinese Taipei Roller Sports Federation,
said a roller skating carnival will be held in Taipei Thursday as a warm-up to
the Taiwanese team's participation in the 2009 World Games in Kaohsiung in
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chiang said he is confident in the Taiwan teams's performance because at the
13th Asian Roller Skating Championships held in October at Haining in China's
Zhejiang province, Taiwan athletes captured 20 gold, 25 silver and 27 bronze
medals.</P>
      <P>Roller skating or in-line skating, also known as rollerblading, has been
formally included as one of the new sports in the next Asian Games in Guangzhou
in 2010.</P>
      <P>The sport looks like Olympic ice skating and is held at velodrome-like venues
similar to those used for track cycling, except that the embankment is not as
steep. Skaters move at a speed of 50-60 kilometers per hour.</P>

      <P>Short selling of 150 selected stocks at prices below the closing levels of the
previous trading day will be resumed from Jan. 5, the Financial Supervisory
Commission (FSC) announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The stocks eligible for short sales at prices below the closing levels of the
previous day will be those that comprise the Taiwan 50 Index, the Taiwan Mid-Cap
100 Index and the Taiwan Technology Index, the FSC said in a statement.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) will be closed Thursday through Sunday for New
Year celebrations and will resume trading Monday when investors will be allowed
to trade the 150 selected stocks short at prices below the closing levels of the
previous trading day.</P>
      <P>The FSC on Oct. 1 imposed a total ban on short selling, at the height of the
global financial turmoil. With world financial markets gradually stabilizing,
the financial regulatory body lifted the ban partially Nov. 28, allowing short
sales of stocks at prices above the previous-day closing levels as part of its
efforts to spur market liquidity and trading volume.</P>
      <P>As the weighted TWSE stock index, the market's key barometer, gained 3.04
percent between Nov. 28 and Dec. 30, the FSC said it decided to further ease
restrictions on short selling by allowing short sales of the 150 blue-chip
stocks at prices below the previous day closing levels.</P>
      <P>The weighted stock index closed at 4,591.22 points Wednesday, up a marginal 2.18
points from the closing level the previous day.</P>
      <P>Compared with the closing level of 8,506.28 points at the end of last year, the
index shed 3,915.06 points, or 46.03 percent, a performance that was better than
China's but worse than the bourses in the United States, Japan and South Korea.</P>
      <P>Altogether, Taiwan's stock market capitalization shrank by more than NT$9.8
trillion (US$296.97 billion). With the current market value standing at around
NT$11.7 trillion, each Taiwan citizen lost an average of around NT$427,000 in

    <HEADLINE>Cross-strait trade agreement more practical than CEPA: SEF deputy</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The deputy chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , Kao Koong-lian,
said Wednesday that it is more pragmatic for Taiwan to ink a Trade and
Investment Framework Agreement with China (TIFA) than a Comprehensive Economic
Cooperation Agreement (CECA) at the present time.</P>
      <P>Kao, who also doubles as secretary-general of the quasi-official SEF, made such
a remark during a press conference held at the Management Institute of Taipei.</P>
      <P>"At the present stage of cross-strait  economic  relations development, it would
be more pragmatic and beneficial for Taiwan to sign a TIFA with China, " said
Kao, adding that such an agreement could pave the way for the inking of the much
more complex and politically sensitive CECA between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait in the future.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the tariff rate issue still needs to be resolved before
both sides can sign a TIFA but the difference in tariff  rates  between  the two
sides might  create  business opportunities for the Taiwanese investors in
China. As foreign products are subject to lower tariff rates in Taiwan, compared
to China, these products could be sold to China for a higher price, explained
Kao.</P>
      <P>Asked about recent criticisms about the proposal of signing a CECA with China,
Kao said that the true meaning of such an agreement is to reduce the tariff
rates and trade barriers in the bilateral trade between Taiwan and China. He
added that some critics emphasized too much on the name of the agreement.</P>
      <P>Some members of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party are concerned that
with the signing of a CECA with China will follow the Hong Kong model, which
would downgrade Taiwan to the level of a local government,  and fall into
China's "one country, two systems" arrangement.</P>
      <P>"The name of the agreement is insignificant compared to its function, " said
Kao. "I am sure the bright minds of both sides of the Taiwan Strait will be able
to find a name that can be accepted by both sides."</P>
      <P>Turing to the just-concluded forum between the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and the
Communist Party of China (CPC) in the mainland, Kao said that the SEF hopes to
establish  multiple  channels  of communications with China through non-
governamental organizations (NGOs).</P>
      <P>He added that the meeting between the KMT and the CPC has not and will not
contradict nor influence the existence and functions of the two quasi-official
intermediary bodies -- Taiwan's SEF and the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>The  SEF  and the ARATS  are quasi-official  organizations representing each
side of the Taiwan Strait in talks on issues related to cross-strait exchanges,
in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>In their second round of talks held in Taipei from Nov. 3-7, SEF Chairman Chiang
Pin-kung,  and his Chinese counterpart,  ARATS President Chen Yunlin, signed
four agreements to allow daily direct flight services, direct shipping and
postal links, as well as the establishment of a food safety mechanism between
the two sides.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has invested major efforts in improving relations with
Beijing since taking office in May, openly stating that he will not pursue
unification or independence during his term, favoring instead a policy focusing
on strengthening economic ties to revive Taiwan's sluggish economy.</P>

      <P>Signing a peace agreement and building a mechanism for military exchanges with
China should come after the two sides develop trust with each other, Taiwan's
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Wednesday in a statement.</P>
      <P>The statement said that forging mutual trust is an issue that must  be resolved
immediately,  as well as those  concerning cross-Taiwan Strait talks and
economic and cultural exchanges between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Settling the issues will establish a solid foundation for Taiwan and China to
build their trust with each other, the MAC said.</P>
      <P>The council, which coordinates Taiwan's policy toward China, released the
statement in response to an address by Chinese President Hu Jintao in Beijing
earlier in the day to mark the 30th anniversary of a message from China to
"compatriots in Taiwan" that called for reunification of the two sides by
peaceful means.</P>
      <P>Stating that the mainland and Taiwan belong to a nation of China, Hu said the
two sides will develop mutual trust politically once they form a common
consensus and uphold the same stance on the problem that concerns how to
maintain the "One China" principle.</P>
      <P>Once such a consensus is reached, Hu said: "Anything in the talks can easily
reach an agreement."</P>
      <P>Hu also called for a military dialogue with Taiwan, saying "the two sides can
pick the right time to engage in exchanges on military issues and explore
setting up a military and security mechanism to build mutual trust."</P>
      <P>This would help "improve the situation in the Taiwan Strait and lessen military
and security concerns" he said in a speech broadcast live on Chinese national
television.</P>
      <P>In response, the MAC reiterated that Taiwan's government has been devoted to
pushing for cross-strait exchanges in an active and goodwill manner since
President Ma Ying-jeou took office May 20.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait relations have improved,  with the signing of agreements that are
beneficial to people of the two sides through systemized talks between two
intermediary bodies -- Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and China's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), the MAC statement
said, referring to four significant agreements signed in November to widely
expand cross-strait transport, trade and postal connections.</P>
      <P>The MAC called for continuing the "positive interactions" based on the principle
of "setting aside controversial disputes and seeking a win-win situation."</P>
      <P>It reiterated that under the Constitution of the Republic of China, Taiwan will
pursue a policy of maintaining the state quo in the strait. This means Taiwan
will not seek unification, independence or wage wars against China, according to
the MAC.</P>
      <P>The government of Taiwan will continue the cross-strait policy that it believes
is in tune with mainstream public opinion, the MAC said.</P>
      <P>It suggested that cross-strait issues be promoted step by step through the
systemized SEF-ARATS negotiation mechanism based on the principles of "equality
and dignity."</P>
      <P>The MAC also urged Beijing to understand Taiwan people's need and desire to join
the international community, expanding the idea of peace to cross-strait
interactions on the international, military and political levels.</P>

      <P>The Presidential Office responded Wednesday to Chinese President Hu Jintao's
speech on pursuing "peaceful development" with Taiwan, saying that both sides
should step up cooperation in a sincere manner in order to win greater trust and
support among the people.</P>
      <P>In a statement released Wednesday evening, the Presidential Office said the
government will be glad to see the peaceful development of relations between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait, as well as a pragmatic approach to promoting
dialogue and mutually beneficial exchanges, so that they can end the state of
hostility, foster mutual understanding, and create new opportunities for both
sides.</P>
      <P>Since May 20,  the Kuomintang (KMT) government, under the Constitution of the
Republic of China, has followed President Ma Ying-jeou's policy of maintaining
the status quo -- "no unification, no independence, no use of force" -- and has
pursued peace, prosperity and progress to the benefit of the Taiwan people, the
Presidential Office said.</P>
      <P>"It has been proven that this policy has won the support of Taiwan's mainstream
public opinion and of the world community. Taiwan is a pluralistic, democratic
society, therefore its people may have differing views about Taiwan's future.
The government will respect the various political persuasions," the office said.</P>
      <P>The recent signing of six agreements between Taiwan and China and the
participation of former Vice President and KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan in
the APEC Economic Summit in November, as well as the opening of direct flight,
shipping and postal services between the two sides earlier this month, were the
results of increasing mutual trust, the Presidential Office stated.</P>
      <P>"The government expects the two sides to exercise wisdom to overcome obstacles
and create a new phase for us both in the spirit of understanding, creativity
and tolerance," it concluded.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Hu's suggestion that both sides should avoid wasting their
resources on clashes on the diplomatic front, Minister of Foreign Affairs
Francisco H.L. Ou said the suggestion is a positive response to Ma's call for a
halt to diplomatic skirmishes between the two sides.</P>
      <P>As for Hu's reiteration of China's insistence on the "one-China principle," Ou
said it was nothing new, because according to the '92 Consensus, with one China
"they can refer to the People's Republic of China, while we can refer to the
Republic of China."</P>
      <P>"It does not mean that the Republic of China does not exist," Ou said.</P>
      <P>He added that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will continue to handle Taiwan's
diplomatic  affairs with dignity,  pragmatism, flexibility and self-
determination.</P>
      <P>Ou expressed the belief that a solution worked out by both sides under these
principles will be accepted by the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hu gave the speech on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of China's
announcement that its policy toward Taiwan would shift from "liberation" through
military invasion to "peaceful reunification."</P>
      <P>He called for a pragmatic approach to the bilateral relationship to ease
concerns over tensions across the Taiwan strait. He also called for military
exchanges between China and Taiwan and for both sides to explore setting up a
military and security mechanism to build mutual trust.</P>

      <P>The main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on Wednesday rejected
Chinese President Hu Jintao's call for it to abandon its pro-Taiwan independence
cause, dismissing the appeal as bucking the cardinal principle of democracy.</P>
      <P>"Hu should understand that Taiwan is a democratic society in which no one is
entitled to demand that another give up his or her political stance or ideals,"
said DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen.</P>
      <P>Tsai made the remarks after Hu urged the DPP to "clearly understand the
situation and stop secessionist activities, " in a speech delivered earlier in
the day to mark the 30th anniversary of a message from China to "compatriots in
Taiwan" which called for reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait by
peaceful means.</P>
      <P>"If the party could abandon its 'Taiwan independence' stance, we would make a
positive response," Hu said.</P>
      <P>Noting that any type of relationship is mutual, Tsai said openness and
intellectual freedom are the core values of a democratic society.</P>
      <P>"It is a violation of democratic principles for someone to ask a political party
to forsake its advocacy or stance as a condition to the start of bilateral
dialogue or interaction," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>The DPP's international  affairs department  also issued a statement that asked
China to understand and respect the democratic principles of refraining from
demanding that others back off their stance or advocacy.</P>
      <P>The statement also said the thorniest cross-strait problem does not lie in the
DPP's stance but rather in the Taiwan people's feelings about China's military
